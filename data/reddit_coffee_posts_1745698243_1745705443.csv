1k8ohgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SwagBucks/comments/1k8ohgz/merge_studio_level_100_took_53_days_of_60/,Merge Studio level 100 - took 53 days of 60,"I've spent an average of 8 hours every day playing this game. No significant tracking issues, just two random in-between levels (worth 1 cent each) and Endless Bundle level 3 never credited. I spent a total of $44.

The purchases I made:

* Endless bundles level 1-3
* Season pass x2 (it costs $10 and swagbucks gave $15 for the first one)
* 10 dollar gems package 
* Gorgeous and legendary bundle (these change daily and have cheap and expensive versions; there is a gorgeous bundle that costs $2 and a legendary bundle that costs $3 if you wait for it.)

To give a rough idea of what progression was like:

* Level 16 - day 1
* Level 30 - day 3
* Level 40 - day 7 
* Level 50 - day 11
* Level 68 - day 23
* Level 76 - day 30
* Level 80 - day 33
* Level 90 - day 43
* Level 94 - day 49
* Level 100 - day 53

I followed the advice of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwagBucks/comments/1jvnt9w/merge_studio_advice/) (many thanks to OP), but would like to add info for the pool race events: don't immediately claim the reward after winning a race, as it will start the timer for the next level. Keep merging until you have the items saved up to complete enough orders, then start the next race level and redeem the coins for the orders. There are 12 levels per race event; I don't remember the first place requirements per level but if you note the numbers down after your first race you can win easily every time if you know the coin requirements and have the orders prepared.

Other random notes: 

The highest level items I ever needed were the level 13 makeup (appeared 4-6 times after level 80 or 90?) and the level 12 gym treadmill.

The level 6 gym bag seemed to give significantly more of the green items than any other one, even compared the max level bag.

Coffee is the easiest order type because they don't produce a secondary item line. I wouldn't recommend using wands or darts on coffee orders unless you need a level 12 one.  

Always keep one coffeemaker at level 6, and one one bathroom cabinet and christmas tree at level 7 so you can recharge them with ads.

I would recommend saving the super charger items for the food/drink and clothing orders; max level orders of those lines start to become common, and the token pouch and sewing box I believe have cooldown times around 1.5-2 hours.  Token pouch I believe you can watch an ad to skip cooldown at 50 minutes remaining, and sewing box at 40 minutes remaining.

I expanded my item storage cabinet up to 18 slots and then started using my gems only for energy or wands/darts/chargers.

Progress started feeling slow after level 70 so I bought the season pass a second time.

After level 90 I started getting daily and weekly quests that often had darts/wands as rewards. There were three main types of daily quest: earn coins, spend energy, or merge items. I'm not entirely sure if this is a level 90 thing or a game update thing, but including the info anyway.

Big fan of theater, opera, and LGBTQ discussions. (You don't have to be queer as long as youre okay with me being gay) 

Also really into gaming (Fallout, cyberpunk, persona, elder scrolls, BG3 especially), good coffee, and just exploring new places.

1k8oc8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSoundTech/comments/1k8oc8j/the_mindful_earbud_shift/,The Mindful Earbud Shift,"There was a time when I put my earbuds in just to block everything out. Traffic noise. Overthinking. Small talk. Sometimes even my own thoughts. Music became a wall. Podcasts became background noise I barely absorbed. And silence? I avoided it like the plague.

But something shifted last year.

One morning in December, I was sitting in a coffee shop, anxious and overstimulated. I reached for my earbuds on autopilot—but paused. I realized I didn’t want to tune out. I wanted to tune in. To something real. Something that would expand me, not distract me. So I opened a meditation app and let a 10-minute body scan guide me into presence. My coffee went cold, but my breath slowed. And that’s where this whole thing started: using my earbuds intentionally. Now, when I reach for them, I ask myself one simple question:

“Is this helping me connect—or escape?”

Some days it’s a podcast that challenges how I think.

Other days it’s a voice memo to myself while walking, untangling ideas.

Sometimes, it’s just rain sounds while I journal. Not to drown anything out—but to make space for inward sound.

Tech isn’t the enemy. It’s the intention behind it. Earbuds, for me, used to be noise armor. Now they’re more like a doorway—into focus, into clarity, into me.

So no, I’m not unplugging from the world. I’m just learning how to plug in with purpose.",1,1745704699.0,CrackSoundTech,0,1.0,False

So my journey was full of fear and expectation to fail. This reddit forum is full of posts about failing and I started to believe I would too... Completely ignoring the success stories were possible for me... So I stopped visiting here because it seemed more doom than success at times. 

I bought every book and practice exam(Hello Dark Helmet, and Lou)... But my ability to focus was poor. 3 pages a week at times... Finally I paid the price for Destination Certification's public boot camp (includes their Masterclass program). 

The boot camp week was intense. 10 hour days and at least 200 ""knowledge check"" questions a night... BUT I did recognized most of the material as things I kept in mental ""cold storage"" from previous certifications. 

The following 2 1/2 weeks I said goodbye to someone very important to me, leading to reschedule of the exam.. I went in expecting to get my ass handed to me.. 

And then it began... And in a weird way... It felt easy? The mountain I built in my head... Mt. Everest... Was more relatable to the tallest hill in town.. Doable... And at times.. Weird turns (those questions that you go ""what the actual f*ck?!"")... But it wasn't this awful experience I expected. 

Decision fatigue is real.. Very real. At about question 82 I said ""I hope this ends at 100, pass or fail..."" You'll never fully know you're answering correctly.. There are just times it feels like ""oh this isn't that bad"". 

Questions could be as simple as ""a business in (insert industry) has to follow a specific framework, what framework is it?""... Or as complicated as ""A CEO wants pizza at 4am on a Tuesday, they're in cornfields in Nebraska, what layer 3 protocol is best for this coffee order?""(facsimile, not actual questions**) 

If I could recommend a singular cost effective resource? Destination Certification book.. The orange boxes and purple boxes 👍 ... If you have money to blow: I can't rave enough about their boot camp which isn't always available but it's their Masterclass, with live q&a, and if you're ADHD like me.. It maybe is your only way to commit.  Destination Certification flashcards and their new quiz questions are also great. 

I liked the CISSP for Dummies, what I did use of it: Approachable, easy read compared to the OSG. 

Don't get me wrong.. Not an easy test... But it's also not an indictment on you as an infosec professional either. Keep up the good fight. ",4,1745704665.0,cissp,4,1.0,False

1k8o6wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1k8o6wj/dating_apps_have_pushed_me_to_ask_this_question/,Dating apps have pushed me to ask this question. What is communication/“the same page?”,"I know that my generation is utterly screwed for actual relationships. But hoooolyyy. 

Recently got out of a situationship that left me utterly baffled. For 3 months, this man talked to me and interacted with me in ways no one had before. All of his friends were shocked at how open and romantic he was. They told me he had commitment and communication issues, but they’d never seen him act like he did around me. Oddly enough, I experienced none of that until the end. And literally everyone around me was shocked at the complete 180, the cold and detached way he did it. He’d texted me like normal and sent me a picture of himself at the gym, and 5 minutes later I received what looked like a chatGPT generated breakup text, claiming the bad communication issues were why it was over text.

And last night, I was on the phone with a man from a dating app (which is now deleted cause I’m done with them) and he asked what my expectations were. I told him I’m looking to get to know someone and I’d like a relationship if things go that way. He said it sounds like we’re on the same page. 

We’re texting later, he offers his place for a first date because he lives alone. (yes it is obvious at this point, I’m just waiting for an out that doesn’t lead to him being dickish 🤦‍♀️.) I say maybe we get coffee first, he suggested coffee and then his place after. I said that’s not what I meant, he said ok maybe that’s for another time then. I said period sounds good. (no, I’m not going to meet him, i just wanted to go to bed in that moment and not deal with sending that “i’m not interested” text.) Well, somehow he found the audacity to say “ur on ur period?” Sir you know the slang, do not. Me - “Uh no??” Him - “Just confirming lol.”

So I asked him outright, “full honesty, are you just looking for a hookup rn?” and he said “yes lol.” Dude how does that sound even remotely like what I said. How do you hear “relationship” and think that’s the same as a fwb. 

**(Bonus info - let me reiterate, I’m not entertaining the idea of meeting him at all, but out of curiosity, I asked when he last got tested. Just to see his response. “Wdym. I’m clean lol”)**

So that begs the question. What on gods green earth is communication? What the hell is “the same page??” 

I guess they can’t fuckin read!! Like for the first example, I thought we were communicating, that whole time. We had talks about our expectations and he fully laid it out there for me and said we were on the same page. And then the 180 flip. So communication is just a lie of convenience. I’m just glad some really suck at lying and get caught before you can get swept away. ",1,1745704269.0,TwoXChromosomes,0,1.0,False

First i thought going back into hobby with classic espresso machine (Ascaso is my favourite right now) and single dosing Niche Zero grinder, self leveling tamper, etc. I think it would be a great combo for me, but not for other members of the family, who dread doing manual work and are prone to mistakes. 

So Oracle Jet came into picture. I see three problems with it, but maybe you can help me find solutions or easy my mind.

1. Shots are way to strong. I read Jet grinds 22g for double shot. I want it closer to 15g. I read you can do some manual adjustments and buy IMS 18 or 14g baskets and use them and grinder + tamper still work great?

2. It's a dual boiler machine and i don't like the idea of filling up Americano with stale water from steam boiler. I like Ascaso system which doesn't use this technology. Maybe Breville uses the same, since it's hot and ready to go really fast?

3. We don't drink enough coffee to have much use of large hopper. Beans will go stale too quick. I wanted to single dose beans in Niche Zero so i can single dose (frozen beans) Jet too. But does it work? I can buy bellows that fit on Oracle Jet so grinding and no retention can be achieved with extra bellows on top. But does automatic tamping still work? Can anyone confirm this?

1k8o6ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1k8o6ks/my_dog_died_in_agonizing_pain_and_it_is_genuinely/,My dog died in agonizing pain and it is genuinely my fault,"Background: I am a crazy person. I have been through all the therapy and worked hard at it, but even though I no longer qualify for my old diagnoses, the same underlying brain is there. The main way this still affects me and others is that I have a history of both becoming convinced of paranoid fears that aren't true, and of overcorrecting for that and ignoring things right in front of my face because I think they're in my head, or of knowing the truth but having already lost my credibility speaking up when I was wrong. Therapy has helped me cope with those situations better, but it hasn't stopped it completely and I don't believe it can. 

My dog died yesterday. She had a surgery to remove a mass on her front leg that was bothering her, and growing, last Thursday. Afterwards she was refusing to eat, uninterested in activities and barely moving. She got hydration and painkillers and anti-nausea stuff subcutaneously that first weekend and it helped a little. She was drinking a little water every day, had eaten some food here and there and would climb all the way up the stairs to poop when we were gone. 

There was a lot of up and down over the next week where it would seem like maybe she was improving but then some new terrible thing would happen, like she released all her pee at once and just laid there in it, or we discovered what turned out to be a weeping pressure sore on her other leg. She was acting a lot like she was dying and we were very afraid that was the case and in communication with the vet but there was also no reason that she should be and we didn't want to cut things short for her if she was just struggling with the stress of recovery. 

She was only 8 or 9 (there was some confusion about her age in vet records vs. prior owners when we first got her), medium sized and for her breed she should have had three or four years left. She was, in health, more of a geriatric dog. She had arthritis and seizures and was increasingly unwilling to exercise, like would not get out of the car when they (she and my ex/best friend who co-parented) went to certain trails, which is very unusual for a heeler and for her in particular. I was worried about this but I have a history of worrying excessively about my pets when I am stressed. 

One worry that had come up continuously for me was that she was having kidney issues. She shook whenever she squatted to pee and I was very concerned that was painful for her, but my co-parent said he didn't see it and the vet said she wasn't worried about it, and then the arthritis seemed to explain it. She'd have other weird symptoms that came and went-- and when I looked up what could be going on, kidney came up over and over again. 

But her labs always came back clean and they were expensive to get, and more importantly, she was reactive and anxious and incredibly stressed out by people who weren't us and being physically handled in general, which is something we made progress on but never truly overcame. She had to get knocked out to have her nails trimmed-- like we took her to special groomers and everything, they were like 'we can't work with this dog'. There was a period before that where her nails were too long for a long time and it hurt her and affected her gait and we desperately wanted to solve the problem but didn't know how-- I tried to teach her to use a scratch board with no success-- the tricks they recommended for rewarding her for doing the thing were meant for less smart dogs, she figured out a way around them. 

I often felt guilty and like we weren't being good enough dog parents for her but she loved and trusted us and would have been incredibly frightened during a second rehome (she was during the first, it was me and her at home all day and it was exhausting but I was so bonded with her) and grieved us like she did my ex-husband (a different ex than the-one-I-pet-coparented-with-who-is-my-longtime-best-friend), whose dog she was originally supposed to be but chose not to maintain a relationship with her after things went sour between us. 

Groomers and strange vets never believed, no, she won't do better without us in the room, I know you see a lot of dogs but this is my dog and we've tried this before with other professionals who were equally confident and had it go horribly wrong. She will believe you are trying to hurt her, hide from you, void her bowels and bladder and snap at you if cornered. I had very severe social anxiety for most of the time I had her and it made it hard for me to be an effective advocate. My choices were let them scare her, in a way it would take days for her to recover from, so they could see I was correct (which I can at least say I rarely chose), or bear the heavy derision and have to fight an uphill battle getting them to believe and work with me. 

Our vet was really great about working with us and her limitations. We would set up vet visits to involve the least amount of stress and invasiveness possible and she would leave the room to let us be the ones to get the cone on, even let us administer oral vaccinations ourselves, etc. 

She and my co-parent were on the same page about this and it was often me who made Jess nervous by overstepping over health worries, freaking her out making sure she was still breathing, feeling a lumpy or weird spot with concern over and over again. She was so tuned into us and could feel our feelings whether or not we displayed them or wanted to-- she got frantic about making us better when we were sad or in physical pain and was easily scared by and tense around anger whether or not it was said out loud/directed at her. My co-parent once knocked over a cup of recently-boiled water or coffee that had been sitting near the door on top of her, we didn't know whether it had cooled off or not, but she reacted so immediately to our horror and fear with a loud cry and physical cringing that I believed she'd been burned and put her through a whole ordeal of getting hosed with cold water in the shower only to find out after it was fine. 

I never wanted to call her a rescue but she was rehomed from an environment that her previous owners recognized wasn't suitable for her-- she clearly wasn't socialized like a heeler needs to be young, and there were young children in the home who could not understand and thereby didn't respect her boundaries, and she was spending most of the day in the kennel before she came to us and was not properly house-trained (I ""taught"" her but she learned so immediately when given the chance she was popping squats to try to fake me out for a treat within two days, she was the smartest dog I have ever met in my life). The phrase her previous owner used was, ""she acts like she's abused but she isn't"" and I'm not convinced she was not abused herself based on the family dynamic witnessed when they handed her off to us. 

It would have been so much easier to get people to listen to me about her limits, not look at me with disgust, etc., if I had just accepted it was simpler to say ""she's a rescue"" but it felt unfair and insulting to the woman who made the hard decision to give her up. Me refusing to do the thing that works with people because the thing that *should* work with people doesn't and being morally rigid is part of one of my mental health conditions and another thing that made me an inadequate parent for her. 

Anyway, our vet ran more tests this week and discovered she needed to be hospitalized which we were only able to pay for because my coparent's family helped. I would not have even been able to give her that chance on my own. I am disabled and poor and would not have chosen to take on the responsibility of a dog on my own, but through life circumstance she became mine. Her labs gave a profile similar to Addison's but also suggested kidney problems. She was in there less than a day-- they did a CT scan and discovered a giant inoperable mass on her kidney. 

I believe I both felt and saw this mass before that and had the very specific fear that there was something wrong with her kidney-- and it was not one of many fears, it was the one same nagging theory-- that it was swollen to the point where I swear you could see it on her back, but our vet thought it was just a muscle at a weird angle and I didn't insist even though I left the office that day feeling I should have. She had stopped being into belly rubs for a while and that was also something I was concerned about but let go of, because I didn't want to be the crazy lady making everybody deal with her head shit. 

I also had other times where I felt sure her quality of life was not what it should be and wracked with guilt at not spending more time with her (I had to move to a new apartment to not lose housing assistance and leave her with my pet co-parent, and I don't drive and have a neuro disorder that sometimes causes me intense pain and extreme responses to temperatures, so I started out walking to see her every day still but I just don't function that well, and my ex was having problems in that house he would not let me help with and I eventually could not handle being around) and I shoved it down and denied it and focused on stupid superficial bullshit instead because I felt powerless to change it. 

I put a lot of my personal time and emotional energy the last few years into stand-up comedy and entering my ""villain era"", of all fucking things. My reasoning was that it helped me overcome my social phobia, and that I was learning to be difficult and accept being disliked in order to be able to protect myself from coercion and live out my highest values, but let's be real, it's also a high-excitement hobby with its own billion little dramas involved where the vast majority of us will never do more than escape from reality with it. 

There were absolutely times, over and over again, where I could have been hanging out with my dog but I ""had"" to get my stage time in at an open mic, or even attend a show I wasn't performing at and didn't enjoy to expose myself to my fears and not let my shitty ex-husband or his friends ""keep me"" from this thing I thought I wanted, or, later, when I didn't see her when my co-parent would have brought her by for a visit because I was in pre-gig freakout mode and didn't want her to be worried about me. 

Obviously all of that is self-deluding bullshit, if I couldn't push myself to be difficult and unlikeable to live out my values when it counted for my dog, who it was my fucking job to protect and care for, and ensure was healthy and safe and living the best life possible. 

We got called, urgently, to say goodbye. She was in so much pain at that point the methadone they gave her didn't even stop it. They offered to give her mercy as soon as she got there but she was so scared of strangers, I wanted her to have a moment with just us. If I had had better presence of mind I would have asked to be the one to put in the stuff that made her unconscious, but I didn't so I was just delaying her release from pain for no reason. I was looking into her eyes when she died and she was staring at the emergency vet scared and in agony. I couldn't even do that last thing right for her. 

The only version of this that isn't my fault is my co-parent's and/or our vet's, both of whom are deeply caring, gentle, patient people who are also distraught about this and don't need me piling on. I don't want to be a fucked-up mentally ill person who makes things worse for people in a tragic situation because I had to assign blame. I also genuinely believe we all failed her. 

I don't want to escape this pain by denying the facts. I know I will have to make peace with my mistakes. I am committed to not killing myself and I cannot grieve for the rest of my life, I will have to function. 

That giant mass didn't appear overnight, it grew and grew until the point it was killing her and she was not able to enjoy eating her favorite foods or having her head out the window in the car or walking in the woods or lolling around in the yard or any of the experiences I hoped I would be able to give her one last time when it was her time to go. 

And it didn't have to be like that. If I had listened to myself even when it wasn't convenient, been more responsible and functional and focused my energy on what was most important, she could have had a happier longer life and not left this world in pain. I have to live with that, and I don't know how yet. I didn't make one little bad judgment call, I made the same mistake over and over again for years on end and it hurt and eventually killed her. 

And she was such an amazing being, and took such good care of me and her other people, and came such a long way in trusting people, and was so brave and tough and had such an extraordinary mind and personality, and I wish I could tell her how sorry I am that I didn't fight for her and gave up on being her difficult overprotective dog mom because I didn't trust myself and was scared of wrecking my credibility, and make it better. And I can't. Reality is what it is. That's not how it works. 

I don't know how to finish this but that's the situation. I know I have to move out of this pain for other people even if I feel like I deserve to sit in it. I don't know how. I will not escape into denial when that's what got me here. 

I feel like pets and other non-human animals are so much more advanced than us in so many ways that matter and we are blessed to have them in our lives, and we do a shitty job at holding up our end and take them for granted. 

I am spiritual sometimes, and my co-parent is very much so, and this morning he told me he had a vivid sense that Jess was in a place of peace now. But I can't feel that right now, or her, at all. When she was dying and I needed to give her all my love I could but now that she's gone it's just empty and I don't buy it. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, at least. I don't believe in an afterlife. If I did I would be going to hell for allowing this to happen. ",1,1745704242.0,Petloss,1,1.0,False
1k8o6ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/JujutsuPowerScaling/comments/1k8o6ft/yuta_could_solo_gojo_and_sukuna_gege/,Yuta could solo Gojo and sukuna -gege,"GGG Gojo wasn’t just hyping Yuta up when he said, “Yuta will be as good as me.” No, he was warning us all that Yuta is built different, with potential unlike anyone else. And let’s be clear: Gojo’s words are basically Gege’s writing. If Gojo says something, it’s because Gege wants us to know it’s improtant.( Don’t care about kenjaku because more stronger more important their words are)

Now, Gojo didn’t say Yuta would surpass him. He said Yuta could be as good as him. But what Gojo left unsaid is this: if Yuta had Sukuna’s mentality, he wouldn’t just match Gojo—he’d surpass Sukuna. That’s the truth Gege has been hinting at all along.

Let’s break it down:
	Gojo - THE GOD of Jujutsu. The guy everyone looks up to. The man who stood toe-to-toe with Sukuna and almost brought him down.
		Gojo says Yuta has the potential to reach his level, which is already insane. But potential alone isn’t enough to surpass someone like Sukuna.
		Sukuna isn’t just strong because of his cursed energy or techniques—he’s strong because he has the mindset of ruthless, ambitious, and completely unshakable.

And here’s the key: If Yuta haddd Sukuna’s mindset, the kind of drive and hunger for dominance that Sukuna has, he’d blow past Sukuna and become the strongest sorcerer to ever exist.

Without Sukuna’s mindset, Yuta will be good.But to truly surpass Sukuna, he’d need to embrace that same brutal ambition. Sukuna’s mentality is what makes him the King of Curses. If Yuta could do that, he’d be unstoppable.

And don’t even get me started on EoS Yuta. The Yuta who has grandkids in the epilogue? THAT Yuta is going to be a freaking monster. With decades of experience, he would unlock a power beyond even Sukuna’s comprehension. And if that Yuta had Sukuna’s mindset? Game over for sukuna and gojo. They  just be another name on the list of people Yuta obliterated.

When that happens, Gojo’s gonna be chilling in the afterlife, sipping his cursed coffee, like, “I told you all this day would come.”

Sukuna and Gojo , pack it up. If Yuta had your mindset, you wouldn’t stand a chance.

Gege already wrote this story ,we’re just watching it unfold so please don’t compare with kenjaku and kashimo . It’s an insult for him

Effective Ways to Improve Marriage Through Communication and Understanding
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Enhancing Connection Through Open Dialogue

One of the most effective ways to improve marriage is by fostering open and honest communication between partners. When you create a safe space where both can express thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment, misunderstandings reduce dramatically. It helps to actively listen when your spouse talks, demonstrating empathy and validating their emotions. This does not mean you always need to agree, but showing that you truly hear and respect their perspective builds trust and intimacy.

Set aside regular times to talk about your day, your worries, and your dreams. Avoid distractions like phones or television during these moments. Simple check-ins can prevent issues from piling up and becoming overwhelming. This habit nurtures emotional closeness and lets each partner feel valued and understood.

### Understanding Emotional Needs and Responses

Every person has unique emotional needs shaped by their upbringing, personality, and experiences. Learning what your spouse needs to feel loved and supported is crucial. You might discover that your partner feels most cared for through words of affirmation, while you may value acts of service more. Knowing these love languages helps you tailor your behavior to meet each other’s needs more effectively.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
Additionally, recognizing how your partner reacts to stress or conflict improves how you handle disagreements. Instead of reacting defensively, try to understand the feelings behind their words and offer reassurance. When you focus on the underlying emotions rather than just the issues at hand, solutions become easier to find.

### Practical Steps to Strengthen Communication and Understanding

- **Practice Active Listening:** Pay full attention, nod, and respond thoughtfully. Avoid interrupting and ask clarifying questions to ensure you understand.
- **Use “I” Statements:** Express your feelings with “I feel...” instead of blaming with “You never...” This lowers defensiveness and opens dialogue.
- **Schedule Regular Check-ins:** Dedicate time weekly or biweekly to discuss how your marriage is going and what might need improvement.
- **Express Appreciation:** Frequently acknowledge your partner’s good qualities and efforts. Appreciation fosters positive feelings and encourages more of the same.
- **Stay Calm During Conflict:** Take deep breaths, and if needed, pause the conversation to avoid saying things you might regret later.
- **Seek to Understand Before Being Understood:** Aim to grasp your partner’s view completely before sharing your own perspective.
- **Respect Differences:** Accept that you won’t always think alike. Celebrate your diverse viewpoints as part of what makes your relationship unique.

### Building Empathy as a Foundation

Empathy is the heart of understanding in marriage. Putting yourself in your spouse’s shoes and imagining their feelings creates a deeper emotional connection. When you meet their experience with compassion, you reduce conflicts and strengthen the bond.

Reflect regularly on moments when your partner felt hurt or lonely. Ask yourself what actions you can take to support them better. Sharing your own vulnerabilities also encourages openness and mutual care, creating a cycle of empathy that deepens over time.

### Encouraging Growth Together

A successful marriage is a partnership of continuous growth. By improving communication and understanding, you lay the groundwork for facing challenges as a team. Set mutual goals for your relationship and celebrate progress together. This shared vision fosters teamwork and strengthens commitment.

Consider attending workshops, reading books, or even seeking counseling if communication barriers persist. These resources offer tools and strategies that enhance how you relate to each other.

Remember, improving any marriage through better communication and understanding is an ongoing journey. Every small step you take towards clearer conversation and deeper empathy enriches your connection. By prioritizing these key areas, you create a loving, resilient relationship that can thrive through life’s ups and downs.

Building Trust and Intimacy to Strengthen Your Marriage Over Time
-----------------------------------------------------------------

<div>[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
 A strong marriage does not happen overnight. It thrives and deepens through ongoing effort and commitment, especially when couples focus on building trust and intimacy together. These two elements form the foundation that helps partners weather challenges and enjoy a more fulfilling relationship. By making intentional choices to nurture trust and emotional closeness, you can significantly improve your marriage over time.

### Understanding Trust as the Cornerstone of Your Relationship

 Trust is more than just believing your partner will be faithful; it involves feeling safe emotionally and knowing that your partner has your best interests at heart. Without trust, doubts and insecurities can gradually erode the connection between you and your spouse.

 Building trust requires consistent, honest communication. When you openly share your thoughts, feelings, and experiences without fear of judgment, you help create a secure environment where your spouse feels comfortable doing the same. This transparency allows both of you to understand each other better and reinforces your emotional bond.

### Effective Strategies to Build and Reinforce Trust

- **Keep Your Promises:** Whether they are big or small, promises act like bricks in the foundation of trust. Follow through on what you say to show reliability.
- **Be Vulnerable:** Sharing your fears and dreams openly helps your partner see the real you, inviting empathy and mutual support.
- **Discuss Expectations:** Misunderstandings often arise when expectations aren't clear. Talk regularly about what each of you needs and wants in the marriage.
- **Apologize and Forgive:** Mistakes happen. Owning your errors and practicing forgiveness without holding grudges helps maintain trust through tough times.
 
### Fostering Intimacy Beyond Physical Connection

 Intimacy is often thought of only as physical closeness, but emotional and mental intimacy are just as important in strengthening your marriage. Emotional intimacy means feeling deeply connected, understood, and accepted by your spouse. Mental intimacy involves sharing intellectual interests and values.

 Prioritizing quality time together encourages these forms of closeness. Engaging in activities that you both enjoy or discovering new hobbies builds shared experiences, which can bring you emotionally closer.

### Ways to Deepen Your Emotional and Mental Intimacy

- **Engage in Meaningful Conversations:** Set aside distractions and talk about your hopes, challenges, and life dreams regularly.
- **Practice Active Listening:** Make sure your partner feels heard by giving your full attention and validating their feelings.
- **Show Appreciation:** Express gratitude for your spouse’s small and big actions to keep positive feelings flowing.
- **Explore Shared Goals:** Plan your future together with clear goals. Working towards common objectives can increase feelings of teamwork and unity.
 
### Balancing Physical Intimacy with Emotional Needs

 Physical intimacy is an important expression of love that reinforces emotional connection. However, it shouldn't be rushed or taken for granted. Frequently, a decline in physical closeness signals deeper issues that require attention.

 To improve physical intimacy, focus on nurturing emotional intimacy first. When you feel safe and connected, physical closeness naturally improves. Be patient and communicate openly about your needs and boundaries. Small gestures like holding hands or cuddling can reignite affection and warmth.

### Practical Habits for Daily Trust and Intimacy Building

 simple, consistent habits into your routine will reinforce trust and intimacy over time. These daily practices keep your marriage vibrant and responsive to each other’s needs:

- Start each day by sharing something positive about your spouse.
- Reserve at least 15 minutes daily without screens to connect and talk.
- Regularly check in with each other emotionally—ask how your partner is truly feeling.
- Create rituals for connection, like weekly date nights or morning coffee together.
 
 Remember, building trust and intimacy is a journey, not a destination. It requires steady effort and genuine care, but the rewards of a resilient and joyful marriage are well worth it. By cultivating these key qualities, you strengthen your emotional bond and create a loving partnership that lasts through all seasons of life.

</div>### Conclusion

Improving your marriage starts with open communication and genuine understanding. When you and your partner take the time to listen carefully and share your thoughts honestly, you create a strong foundation where both of you feel valued and heard. This kind of connection helps to resolve conflicts more smoothly and deepens your emotional bond.

Trust and intimacy are the building blocks that keep your relationship growing over time. Trust grows when you consistently support each other and keep your promises. Intimacy isn’t just about physical closeness; it’s about sharing your fears, dreams, and everyday moments. By nurturing this connection regularly, you create a safe space where both of you can be your true selves without fear of judgment.

Remember, improving your marriage is an ongoing process. It’s about small, meaningful actions each day that build respect, love, and commitment. Whether it’s expressing appreciation, setting aside time to talk, or simply being more patient, these efforts add up and bring you closer together. Focusing on communication, trust, and intimacy gives your marriage the strength it needs to thrive, no matter what challenges come your way.

By making these steps a priority, you can enjoy a marriage filled with understanding, warmth, and lasting happiness. You have the power to create a partnership where both of you grow, heal, and celebrate life together—a truly rewarding journey worth embracing every day.

1k8o6c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1k8o6c5/9_years_at_my_current_position_need_a_sense_of/,9 years at my current position & need a sense of direction,"I need some advice on what to do cause I feel lost at my current position.

NOTE: I’ve been in retail since 2012 so I have plenty of retail experience.

I’ve been working at my current employer for just over 9 years, and I feel I’m beginning to hit my “ceiling”. 

I started in the coffee bar back in January 2016 and was there till January 2017 which I transferred to on of our Outlet locations.  During my time in the Coffee Bar, around September-October, the Outlet location I later transferred to needed some help and was willing to offer overtime pay.  So I helped out for a bit and was enjoying the environment and the fast-pace feel that I was working with.  Which is why I later transferred there.

While at the Outlet store for 2.5 years, I knew I wanted to go back and be a sales associate that was commission based because I knew how to work with people.  During my time at the Outlet, I got to open two locations and help them out [overtime], & help at our location at Mall of America when Minnesota hosted the Super Bowl.  I was later “pasted over” for a potential opportunity to be a Floor lead for Men’s and Shoes since that’s what I mostly worked with.  To which I said to my manager, “You can either [Transfer me back] or you can fire me; and we can play it either way”.  Shortly after that, an opportunity to work in a sales role came up to which I jumped at the opportunity and transferred back to my original location.

My previous roll, I was handling rental Tuxedos & Suit for weddings/special events.  I have to help give ideas on what would look good with whatever details the bride & groom wanted (unless it didn’t make any sense).  It was a fun process of understanding people’s needs for weddings/events/etc..  My location was one of the top locations in terms of sales.  After about 3.5 years, my manager offered me a roll to work on sales floor to be a full time commission based employee, to which I accepted.

My current roll, I’m working with people to understand their needs & wants for clothing, Styling people, etc. and for the first year it was fun and a great hustle workflow.  I was even in the top 15 sales associates overall in my first year.  My second year was a bit of a dip because of a hire we had that was stealing sales.  He was let go after about 10.5 months, but the damage was done and my sale was severely down.  My third [current] year is somewhat better, but still not as good as my first year.  While I do enjoy helping people out and problem solving, I’m beginning to feel like I’m being under-valued and under-appreciated because of all the new hires they bring in.

While I understand the current environment is changing and unpredictable because of the tariffs,  it is really taking a toll on me and my some of my coworkers.

I wonder if I should still be where I am, or if there are better opportunities for me with my current skill sets.  I would like some ideas or advices on what you think would be ideal for me.

There have been a lot of of people asking about the return process and Minisforum not responding. I have seen people in their Discord and here past the 3 month mark asking for a return and still going. Here is my guide to the work (and it is work) to get your PC fixed and back to you.

My Minisforum EM780 broke after 183 days. It was bought from their UK storefront. I felt they should replace it. It was a fight. To the point [Minisforum offered me a coffee cup to delete my Reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minisforumofficial/comments/1jmn3ms/anyone_successfully_rmad_to_minisforum_uk/). It was clear that I was already *the mug*...

# TLDR:

*These are the top takeaways from the process that you might need if you find yourself in the same situation.*

1. **Buy a Beelink or another company**. Typing in ""Minisforum"" into the MiniPCs subreddit only brings up panicked, miserable posts. I wish I'd done that first.
2. If you want a Minisforum PC (same as any of these brands), **buy from Amazon**. Not often your hear people telling you to buy from them, but their customer service is responsive and accountable in the UK. Although the UK site is technically held to the [2015 UK Consumer Rights Act](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/reclaim/consumer-rights-refunds-exchange/). It does not have any offices or warehouses in the UK (Their warehouse is the Semi detached house in the picture). I wish I'd done that first.
3. The reason that you're here. You bought from Minisforum, your PC broke and you have to get through their RMA process. You are going to have to log everything you do (e.g. signed for parcel returns, screenshots), and post to their [email](mailto:uk@minisforum.com), [Discord](https://discord.gg/AHxfwFFRCu) and [Reddit ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minisforumofficial/)at the same time to get responses. **Post DAILY, Minisforum won't reach out to you.**

Thank you to u/SerMumble for the deeper information on contacting Minisforum and u/KAh00t for suffering with me in the trenches (let's grab a pint sometime).

# --- The Longer Post ---

Below is the process, as it happened to me and how I dealt with it. If you need more information dig into that. [You can read how the it spiraled out in real time in this Reddit post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minisforumofficial/comments/1jmn3ms/anyone_successfully_rmad_to_minisforum_uk/)[and this Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/804545693015736320/1173556180161941614).

**Weeks 1-3: The Churn**

This going to a strange one. It'll will start with friendly mails asking you to go through rudimentary checks for a couple of days. So far, so standard. Then MF will ask you to post you PC to their UK Warehouse. This is where it gets weird. MF do not have any presence in the UK. No warehouses. They will ask you to post to a private address. See the picture header for the details.

MAKE SURE you get your parcel tracked. As it's not really a warehouse, MF don't really have too much contact with this address. When it has arrived at that address, send your confirmation, with screen shots of it arrived at the destination. This proof with force MF to contact and confirm the delivery. This will take multiple emails. Be persistent.

During my time during this *I was repeatedly told that my PC had not arrived when it had*. It took a lot of back and forth emails and going to Discord to get this part sorted.

**Weeks 3-6: Pleading For Your Return**

The most painful part of the RMA process. If you are asking for a replacement you will need to pay an excess to them through PayPal.

You will be told that after you have paid, your replacement will be sent out immediately. *It will not be*. This took duplicating Discord messages, email messages and Reddit posts to get their attention. Make sure you always put your return address on your correspondence. This should hopefully cut down a few days of circular emails asking where they want to send the return. I had to send them my return address 3 times...

Ask for the tracking number for the return you have paid for. No matter what you have been told, your PC will not be sent out until you have this. When you do get this number, hopefully it's just not the wait for it to get back. The 3-5 day delivery on their website is a flat out lie. Even after I got the tracking number, it was a week before the PC was picked up by FedEx.

**The Aftermath**

I'm the UK, MF will reply at around 4am in the morning, stopping around 8am. So the earlier you can get up and reply to the messages, the better. **Minisforum do check Reddit and clearly care about their PR**. That seemed to expedite my process ALOT. Cross post to their Reddit and discord. The MiniPCs Subreddit really helped with the muscle too. They do check this space.

I want to thank the MiniPcs Subreddit for the support. It was this place that gave extra push to MF to get my RMA done. **They will send free PCs to YouTubers that just review Doom 2016 on it for 5 mins but the paying customers are picking up the tab for those freebies.**

I did ask for compensation for the misinformation and complacency. I got a rather sarcastic reply from them, ""*Please rest assured that we are a regular company. Sorry for not providing you with perfect service*.""

Aside from the compensation (as the photo shows) I was asked to delete my Reddit posts with the offer of MF merch. I declined. I think these posts have helped me out and they should help future people in my situation out (and it was a low ball offer! Plus, they couldn't return a PC without it being my full time job. what hope would I have for anything more from them? :D).

Take what you want from that. Minisforum have already taken your money.",2,1745704190.0,MiniPCs,2,0.75,False
1k8o40c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k8o40c/does_tastyle_k310ic_mini_coffee_maker_review/,Does Tastyle K310IC Mini Coffee Maker Review Reveal the Best Travel Brewer?,"Tackling early mornings with a fresh cup of coffee has been infinitely easier since I started using the Tastyle K310IC Mini Hot and Iced Coffee Maker. This sleek and compact coffee machine caters to my unpredictable caffeine cravings with remarkable flexibility. Whether brewing a steaming hot cup on a frosty morning or experimenting with chilled iced coffee during a scorching afternoon, this gadget delivers with finesse. Despite its plethora of features, I found there are aspects that might make one pause before hitting ""buy now""—but let me break it down.

**Compact Design for Small Spaces**  
Its small footprint is one of the most striking aspects. Measuring only 8.2""D x 4.2""W x 10.3""H and weighing 2.59 pounds, it practically blends into any corner of my kitchen counter without hogging space. The lightweight build makes it a breeze to pack and take along for travel, whether it's in an RV or to a dorm. The downside is the water tank isn't detachable, requiring frequent refills. But honestly, this trade-off felt pretty minor given its portable nature.  

[Grab Tastyle K310IC at the best price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0dhcjdjbw/)  

**Flexible Brewing Options**  
This coffee maker had me hooked when I found out it brews both K Cups and coffee grounds. It's got this dual brewing capacity, working with pods or ground coffee like a pro. My mornings no longer have to revolve around a singular choice! Using the deep extraction technology, it doesn’t just brew coffee quickly—it delivers a strong aroma and flavor without overusing coffee grounds. The ability to adjust between 6 to 14 ounces based on how much water you add ensured consistency, though precision lovers might find the lack of a removable tank a bit frustrating. That said, every brew I've had so far has hit the spot, whether it's a long day at work or a leisurely weekend.  

**Advanced Features for Better Usability**  
Convenience comes naturally to the K310IC. Its self-cleaning function has saved me from those annoying post-brew clean-up days. Plus, I loved the built-in descaling reminder that ensures everything operates smoothly. And when I forget to turn it off after brewing? Well, the auto shutoff feature has my back. Not to mention, the whole affair is safe with smart water-level alerts and dry boil protection.  

**Good Aspects**  
- Compact and lightweight; fits easily into tight spaces.  
- Dual capacity for pods and ground coffee, and flavors stay consistent.  
- Hot and iced coffee brewing in just three minutes.  
- Self-cleaning and descaling reminder for maintenance ease.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Non-removable water tank can be a hassle for some.  
- Limited brewing size options might feel confining.  

**Performance Under Pressure**  
Being fully automatic, this machine simplifies the brewing process—just tap a button, and it goes to work. I noticed the 175°F temperature delivers coffee with a depth of flavor. And hey, that’s science-backed for optimal taste, right? On the iced coffee front, using the included recipe book was a game changer. My creations rival coffee shop brews, though the lack of a proper milk frothing feature could’ve put the icing on the 'cake.'  

**Competing Products**  
The coffee maker scene is swarming with competition. I’ve tried the Keurig K-Mini before, and while it offers comparable compactness, it didn’t handle iced coffee as seamlessly as this one did. Meanwhile, Black+Decker’s Brew 'n Go felt like a solid alternative with its travel mug focus, but it limited itself to only ground coffee. The Tastyle K310IC, however, bridges both pods and grinds with more brewing size flexibility. Ultimately, it feels like a jack-of-all-trades among its peers.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
For its size, versatility, and modern perks like auto shutoff and self-cleaning, this coffee maker seems like a thoughtfully engineered package. It isn’t priced as steep as many premium machines, and the value-for-money ratio leans heavily in its favor. Fancy a quick cup at home or while braving a camping trip? It scratches several use-case itches. The ability to whip up a stress-free, custom-brewed drink regularly feels well worth the investment in this mini machine.

It is a gorgeous day where I am. I moved here back in July 2024.

I have hit up a few sober fellows of mine to hang. No responses or people are busy already. I also feel like a few of the people I hit up, I texted just because they are queer and sober. Not sure if we have enough in common to hang out? But I figured I would at least try. 

Been hanging out with myself for almost a year. I go to coffee shops. Restaurants. All kinds of things. 

Sometimes I feel like I am just not queer presenting enough to be included with those people. And they have known each other for so long. We get along great at meetings (AA) and we laugh at fellowship (the meeting after the meeting Iykyk). They talk about making plans for picnics, and boats rides. I feel awkward jumping in and being like… “Could I be a part of that?”

I am perfectly content just introverting for the day. But it’s sucks when you try and it’s kind of a fail. I will always try again. But I guess this goes out to some of us who feel like we have to prove our queer/transness.

I have a lot of respect for this man he’s pushing 80 does this job for almost nothing stays active hunts and traps does a lot for the town. He’s been a family friend for years always asks before he hunts my property even when I’ve told him he doesn’t need to. Man has more right to hunt my property then me he’s been hunting it since he was a child.

So I go into the office to pay when we start talking about animals and trapping( he traps nuisance animals if they are causing damage for the local towns) and we get to talking about my work. I’m full time for the national guard and he was in Vietnam so he always likes to chat me up. He brings up the administration ( I just ignore this, while I think this is the worst one i have been through 5 while in some bad some good it’s life and a each one tries their own policies and we adapt) then he said something that saddened and disappointed me. 

He said “ when I was in I’d you were a F__ they would show you the door” and in a context of I hope they do it again while smiling. I was like well one I serve with a ton of lgbtq people my best friend in the army is lgbtq. I just said have a nice day and drove away.

Can pu'er really be as cheap as pictured or is it very low quality?

RM 60 = \~$14 USD.

Longer story if of interest: I live in northern Europe but my family are overseas Chinese from Malaysia.   
I'd happily drink any shu at yum cha without thinking about it, but I used to mainly drink coffee daily. I only realised what I had been drinking years later when I tried shu for the 'first time', only to realise I'd been drinking it for years.

I only really got into pu'er tea since I've been in northern Europe. When I was younger, I'd passed by many teashops in Hong Kong, Mainland China, Singapore, Malaysia &c. but never paid particular attention to what could be had, nor at what price, so I've no frame of reference despite my origins.

My only experience of buying pu'er is domestically in Europe with a hefty mark-up, or directly from the aforementioned sellers. I mentioned to a relative in Malaysia I'd like to have some pu'er when I go to visit, and they sent me lots of photos from a tea shop, some of which are pictured above (I know one of them is a white tea, included it for a wider reference point). I know Malaysia is a popular place to store and age pu'er and apparently my town has many warehouses for that purpose.

Can pu'er really be this cheap or is it very low quality? 

  
I'm sceptical of the gushu claim at $14, and what is written in Chinese just looks like a generic wrapper with a very broad origin statement (and I know secondary distributors repackage bings freely). No year statement on the sheng and the shu. Then again, I'm mainly used to the funky art from BL and W2T!

I recently received my blood test results, and I was diagnosed with a severe iron-deficiency with anemia.
I believe this is mainly due to my diet: most of my meals are made up of yogurt/dairy products, veggies and eggs. I don’t really eat much in terms of starches/carbs. Dairy products and eggs are really the only foods that appeal to me and that I manage to eat both at lunch and dinner. In the morning, I usually just have coffee. I read that dairy and coffee can interfere with iron absorption, which makes me quite certain that my low iron levels are related to my eating habits.

The problem is, I suffer from eating difficulties (I have ARFID/sensory issues) and dairy, eggs and veggies (specifically cauliflower or mushroom) are the only foods I can tolerate right now. 

I have also tried taking iron supplements. At first, I took Tardyferon (which, if I’m not mistaken, contains ferrous sulfate), but it caused me severe stomach pain, constipation, and nausea. Then I switched to iron bisglycinate, hoping it would be easier to tolerate, but I experienced the same side effects.One week after stopping the supplements, I felt significantly better. Because of these experiences, I am very reluctant to start taking iron supplements again.
in my situation?

How can I improve my iron levels given these limitations? What should I do?

Thank you for your help I am really desperate right now as my blood test are getting worse as well as my physical health…

1k8nxac,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k8nxac/investigate_if_the_bodum_pour_over_coffee_maker/,Investigate if the Bodum Pour Over Coffee Maker is worth buying review,"Crafting the right cup of coffee often starts with the perfect coffee maker, and I recently tested the Bodum 11592-109, a pour over coffee maker brimming with thoughtful design elements and functional features. With its high-heat borosilicate glass, reusable stainless steel filter, and cork grip, this coffee maker manages to combine style with practicality while being eco-friendly. I've spent time using this for daily coffee rituals, exploring different techniques, and finding out where it shines and where it might fall short.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The borosilicate glass carafe immediately caught my attention; it's sleek, modern, and practical. The included cork sleeve not only adds a rustic touch but also serves a thermal purpose, keeping my hand comfortably insulated from heat while pouring hot coffee. I liked how lightweight yet sturdy it felt. It's portable enough to move around the house yet robust enough to endure daily use. However, I’d advise being gentle with it—although durable for glass, accidents could be detrimental. Still, its aesthetic appeal often drew compliments from an unexpected source: my usually indifferent teenage son, who decided to try his hand at pour-over coffee!  

**Ease of Use and First Impressions**  
Simplicity is the strength of this coffee maker. After assembling the cork securely onto the carafe (a task that takes a little getting used to), I tried brewing a fresh cup with coarsely ground coffee beans. Following the instructions, I poured a small amount of hot water over the grounds for blooming, watching the process closely—it’s strangely therapeutic. The stainless steel filter eliminates the need for wasteful paper filters, and I could see the natural coffee oils collecting in the carafe, hinting at a rich brew ahead. The first cup was satisfying and surprisingly flavorful, better than the automatic coffee maker sitting in the corner.

[Ready for Bodum 11592-109? See the Amazon deal.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b01lq2pzdw/)

**Advantages**  
-One of the product's main strengths lies in its environmentally friendly design, complemented by the reusable filter.  
-Dishwasher-safe components make cleanup minimal and stress-free.  
-The cork grip is an excellent insulator and adds to its visual charm.  

**Areas of Concern**  
-While the filter works well for coarse grounds, finer coffee grains can sneak through, leaving a bit of grit in the coffee.  
-The carafe, although sturdy for glass, can feel fragile, requiring mindfulness during use or washing.  
-Though not a major flaw, some might find the brewing process tedious compared to quicker alternatives.  

**Brewing Experience Compared to Peers**  
While trying out this product, I revisited my Chemex, known for its glass build and bonded paper filters. The Chemex looked strikingly similar at first glance but produces a cleaner taste profile due to its thicker filters catching most sediments. However, the Bodum’s stainless steel filter delivers a richer, oilier brew. Compared to the Hario V60—also popular among pour-over fans—the Bodum is less fuss-free as it doesn’t require precision in pouring technique. That feature makes it more suitable for beginners, while some coffee enthusiasts may argue that the V60 allows for greater control over extraction.

**Performance Observations**  
Over a few weeks of use, I pushed this coffee maker to its limits by brewing daily for family and hosting friends occasionally. I realized the carafe’s smaller volume (17 ounces) could only brew about two medium mugs of coffee per round. If you're usually hosting a crowd or tend to drink multiple rounds of coffee in the morning (as I do), you might find yourself repeating the brewing process several times. The ease of washing the parts, including the steel filter, slightly offset this extra step.

**Value Proposition**  
Price-wise, I found this product sitting at an accessible point for someone venturing into pour-over coffee but not willing to make a significant investment. It’s priced competitively given its quality build, reusable filter, and the cork sleeve—details that aren’t features in every pour-over coffee maker. Cheaper alternatives often lack the durability or eco-friendliness this Bodum model boasts, making me feel like I scored an environmentally sound, stylish tool without overspending.

## Key Considerations When Choosing Your ideal Cushion Couch Floor

Before you rush out to buy floor sofa options, it's critically important to consider a few key factors to ensure you select the perfect one for your needs.

*   **Size and Configuration:** Think about the size of your space and how you plan to use the floor sofa. Do you need a large seating area for entertaining, or a smaller, more intimate setup for personal relaxation? Consider the number of people you typically host and the layout of your room. Modular floor sofas are ideal for flexible configurations, while single oversized floor cushions for adults may be perfect for solo lounging.

*   **Material and Durability:** The material of your floor sofa will significantly impact its comfort, durability, and aesthetic appeal.

    *   **Fabric:** Fabric floor sofas are generally more affordable and come in a wide variety of colors and patterns. Look for durable,stain-resistant fabrics like cotton,linen blends,or microfiber.

    *   **Leather:** Leather floor sofas are durable, stylish, and easy to clean. They offer a timeless aesthetic and can withstand heavy use. Tho, leather can be more expensive than othre materials.
    *   **Consider specific needs:** Families with young children might prioritize washable covers for easy cleaning, while pet owners may opt for scratch-resistant materials.

    *   **Polyester Fiberfill:** Polyester fiberfill is a more affordable option, but it may not provide as much support as foam. It's best suited for decorative cushions or for layering on top of a foam base.
    *   **Consider back support:** Look for options with built-in backrests or consider pairing your floor cushions with supportive pillows. A floor sofa with back support will be especially important for those who plan to use it for extended periods of sitting.

I’m 35 M and for eight straight years every sniffle mutated into a full‑blown infection: cheeks felt packed with wet concrete, eye‑socket pressure pulsed with my heartbeat, and a rotten‑dish‑sponge smell haunted only my own nose. Thick green glue slid down my throat, upper teeth throbbed like loose wires, and a low fever kept me foggy enough to reread the same Slack message five times. Nights were a carousel of mouth‑breathing, gaggy drip, and 3 a.m. headaches that made the pillow feel like a brick.

Antibiotics would knock the beast down for a week, tops. Then the pressure crept back, the phantom smell returned, and I’d be queued at the pharmacy again. My ENT’s last visit: “We can try another long‑term antibiotic, but septoplasty is probably next.” Surgery chatter is what finally pushed me to trawl the internet at stupid‑o’clock for alternatives.

Fast‑forward to this January: I’m curled up on the couch at 3 a.m. with a low‑grade fever, half a box of tissues, and the YouTube algorithm serving me a clip on “photobiomodulation for chronic sinusitis.” Sounded like sci‑fi nonsense, but the comment section was people with CT scans bragging about clear sinuses. I had a credit‑card reward burning a hole in my pocket, so I ordered a handheld red‑light thing made for noses.

Using it is weirdly simple. You charge it like a phone, rinse two little silicone tips, slide them just inside your nostrils (don’t jam—think earbuds resting), hit the one button, and it glows red for exactly ten minutes before shutting off. I treat it like enforced doom‑scroll time.

Night two the pressure behind my left eye did this tiny *squeak‑pop* and, for the first time in months, air moved. By the end of week one I’d gone an entire day without my steroid spray. I kept waiting for the relapse that always comes—never showed. It’s been eight weeks now, zero antibiotics, no 3 a.m. drip‑gagging, and I can smell morning coffee before it finishes brewing.

Why it works: red wavelengths around 650 nm apparently goose your cells into reducing inflammation and pulling in blood, which lets the gunk drain instead of fermenting. Could be placebo, could be timing. All I know is my CT follow‑up last Friday showed open passages for the first time since 2018.

Negatives? my girlfriend laughs at the Rudolph glow. Small price to pay for breathing.

We’d love to open up our own cafe in the day, bar at night shop. We understand we would have to take out a huge loan, get a ton of licenses, and that it won’t be profitable for quite some years, and even then- it won’t be too profitable.

But a lot of folks are negative when it comes to this stuff. We live in a very high traffic city where a latte costs about $7 and there are probably about 200 customers on a slow day, 500 customers on a busy day/ for our favorite local coffee shop.

We just don’t want 9-5’s. We’ve tried that and it just isn’t for us. 

Any tips or advice would be great. I also do understand how tempting it’ll be to make the “the easiest way to make a million dollars is to open a coffee shop with two million dollars!” or a “that’s a minimum wage job” jokes and comments, but we already know the risks, and are willing to risk it.

Any steps or just things to note would be appreciated. 

Thanks!!

How this diet helped me so much with my mental health, my confidence, my physique (I actually was slightly underweight when I started and already gained ~8kg), helped me build good habits to propel my life forward, you name it 

Instead I decided to make it about coconut cream. This stuff is literally a godsend. The actual coconuty taste is pretty subtle, and if you get the 'rich' kind the stuff is dummy thicc and therefore an amazing replacement for anything creamy in your dishes. I do my salad dressings with it, or 'desserts' (it combines incredibly with a couple finely cut strawberries, I bet it makes a great 'keto ice cream', too) and honestly, I like the taste so much, I basically put it on everything.

It has about 5g of carbs per 100g and still has this really nice, sweet-ish taste that is a wonderful change of pace in the otherwise very non-sweet diet that is keto. 

The light variant, that is more liquid, is also awesome. In my morning coffee it's actually an alright milk replacement. Does have a unique taste combo, but I actually enjoy it a lot and am know experimenting with different beverages, like macha on a big glass of ice cubes and light coconut cream for example sounds crazy good, I'll report back once the stuff arrives ,

Imagine this: you're sipping coffee at some sun-bleached café, casually checking your phone, and—*cha-ching*—another Bitcoin payment just hit your wallet. No invoices, no awkward ""Did you get my Venmo?"" texts, no bank fees carving up your soul. Just pure, unstoppable **Bitcoin** flowing straight to you, courtesy of **Bitcoin payment links**.

Welcome to the future. Actually, scratch that. Welcome to the **now**.

And the best part? Setting all this up is easier than stealing candy from a centralized bank—thanks to the magic of a [**Bitcoin payment link generator**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/payment-button/).

# What Are Bitcoin Payment Links Anyway?

Think of **Bitcoin payment links** like the ultimate money hack. You don’t need a merchant account. You don’t need a POS system. You don’t even need to be a developer.

A Bitcoin payment link is a simple URL you can send, post, embed, or shout from the rooftops that lets anyone, anywhere, instantly pay you in Bitcoin. Tap the link, scan a QR code, and boom—payment sent.

No bank managers involved. No wire transfers. No 5-7 business day nonsense.

Just raw, unfiltered peer-to-peer magic.

# Why Bitcoin Payment Links Are Absolutely GOATed

* **They’re Simple**: Your grandma could use Bitcoin payment links to sell her homemade banana bread.
* **They’re Global**: Whether you're chilling in Miami or hiding out in some remote mountain village, Bitcoin payment links work anywhere the internet dares to tread.
* **They’re Permissionless**: No one can “freeze” your Bitcoin payment links. No one can reverse a payment. Once those sats are sent, they’re yours, baby.
* **They’re Lightning Fast**: Lightning Network support? Yep, it’s 2025, we’re living in the fast lane.

Whether you're a creator, entrepreneur, or just someone who refuses to bend the knee to the TradFi lords, **Bitcoin payment links** are your weapon of choice.

# Enter: The Bitcoin Payment Link Generator That Changes Everything

Alright, so you’re convinced. You’re ready to dive headfirst into the future.  
But how do you *actually* make these magical links?

That’s where the [**Bitcoin payment link generator**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/payment-button/) steps in.

This tool isn’t just good. It’s absurdly, stupidly good.

You simply:

1. Plug in your Bitcoin address.
2. Set a price (if you want).
3. Click a button.

And like a crypto wizard casting a spell, the **Bitcoin payment link generator** creates a custom URL (plus an optional QR code) you can use immediately.

Post it. Embed it. Tattoo it on your forehead. It’s yours.

# 1 Link = Infinite Possibilities

The genius of Bitcoin payment links is that they're **versatile**.

* **Selling Art?** Post your Bitcoin payment link under every post. No middlemen needed.
* **Freelancer?** Drop a Bitcoin payment link at the bottom of every invoice.
* **Street Performer?** Print your QR-coded Bitcoin payment link on a giant poster and rake in the tips.
* **Activist or Content Creator?** Use a Bitcoin payment link to accept donations without worrying about being deplatformed.

Wherever you can post a URL, you can get paid. It’s that simple.

The [**Bitcoin payment link generator**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/payment-button/) turns every URL into a tiny, unstoppable piece of financial infrastructure.

# Traditional Payments Are for Dinosaurs

I mean, seriously, are we still pretending PayPal is cool?

* Fees like a mob boss skimming off your hard work.
* Random account freezes just because you dared to be ""suspicious.""
* Arbitrary chargebacks from people who ""didn’t mean to buy that.""

Add onto that POTS and probably menopause and incontinence is happening, TMI but constipation from hypomotility seems to be a massive trigger, also I (barely) manage POTS with water intake, electrolytes including magnesium and coffee for brain fog which affect the bladder I assume. 

I got some improvement doing the trial for Axionos but don't want to commit and of course the dr (2nd opinion) has no other ideas. Since my symptoms are still manageable I was wondering if a dr in NYC did PTENS, I'd rather not do a surgery right now after having had so many over the years. Also, tall order but if anybody miraculously knows of one I really want a urologist who understands POTS and my dehydration and neurological issues. For instance medication for that (midodrine) reduced my urine volume but no dr understands why, I believe it's because it might work like Gemtesa so a CNS aspect I suppose. Ironically the similarly named Gemzar messed up my bladder, that's the instillation chemo I had. I also wonder if the POTS contributors are going on with me and affecting bladder--Sjogrens disease, mast cell issues, hypermobility and that's why I didn't want to go right into an implant if other factors are messing me up.",1,1745702009.0,OveractiveBladder,0,1.0,False

1k8n3dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1k8n3dq/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

Filming a Dj thats just starting out and he wants to make a promotional video for an event he wants to host in May. He has a DJ gig tomorrow and the main goal is to get a promo video out of it. Event is indoors in the morning for a coffee rave type of event.


Thoughts:
1) Thinking of shooting 4k 60fps with a mix of establishing shot, medium and close up shots. Suggestions for Aperture here - Wide open for close ups (f1.8) and for medium and establishong go to f2.8 up to f4?
Promo video will under a minute long, fast cuts to the beat of one of his mixea and footage will be slowed down to 24fps. Is this a good idea?

2) Should I shoot normal 24fps shots as well? Not sure if the vibe is better if its not slowed down and use fast cuts on same scenes at 24fps. Only issue with this for me is that i have no gimbal. R8 doesnt have ibs but lens does have IS, leaning towards shooting 60fps so at least its smooth.

3) Bringing another camera (R10 with a 24mm) lens to just record the whole thing on the side. Thoughts on this? It will show me going around him at times taking photos/videos but figured it would be good to have more footage. 
Also in terms of how to do that.. thinking manual focus on him at like... f4? or leave it at f2.8 and let everyone be blurry? Just dont want DJ to get out of focus if he moves around too much

4) Any sample videos of solid DJ promo videos would be appreciated.

Thanks for taking the tine to read my long ass post!


ps. fairly new to videogaphy, really my first paid gig and DJ is a friend of mine as well. Gear is Canon R8, rf35mm f1.8. Other camera is an r10 apsc 24mm f2.8. No gimbal

1k8myff,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1k8myff/how_can_i_fiximprove_my_ingress_and_dns_setup/,How can I Fix/Improve My Ingress and DNS Setup?,"Sorry for the long post, I tend to overexplain, in my work details matter, so here is a 

TL;DR;  
Need help changing setup so I can use my laptop at home to access the services on my home server w/o needing to change DNS or requiring a VPN.  While traveling I need access to a few services w/o VPN, and the rest can be behind a VPN.  When I know what I need to set up I will start researching setup and how-tos.  
\------

Right now I have TrueNAS running and a Talos VM with all the TrueCharts apps that I was running before I upgraded to EE. I did not set it up, and it is confusing as all hell and just isn't working for me. I'd still consider myself a TN/Linux newbie, but I have a decent grasp on containers and pretty much everything that's NOT network related.

I want to redo the setup using native TrueNAS apps or the TrueNAS Custom App option (using compose yaml files). I played with it and was able to install several apps fairly easily. The issue I have run into is that I am unable to access any of them. Right now everything runs through the Talos VM. I have to set my DNS to the Talos IP for things to work correctly.

What I would like is to be able to access all my services via domain. I have a domain already. I'd like a few services like Jellyfin, Calibre and music server to be easily accessible outside of my network. Fire Sticks and TV apps don't like messing with DNS or trying to get through a VPN. Everything else I can access through a VPN/Tunnel or something like Wireguard or Tailscale.  I also run HAOS (VM of Home Assistant) and would like to be able to access that from anywhere.

Right now the following is being used in the kubernetes environment (I did not set it up, which is one of the issues):

Traefik - Reverse Proxy  
Blocky - DNS Proxy and Ad Blocker  
WG-easy - VPN  
LLDAP  
DDNS-Updater  
Clusterissuer - Cert Manager

This is MY understanding of things...  
Traefik is used to route traffic to the particular container based on the URL entered  
Blocky... I don't really know what a DNS Proxy is/does, but I know I want an ad blocker for my network.  
WG-Easy is the Wireguard VPN Tunnel.  I like this one, it IS easy :)  
LLDAP is used for user authentication.  However I am not sure I am really using it anywhere.  
DDNS-Updater updates my IP at Cloudflare so my domain can always fine me  
Clueserissuer is a ""Cert Manager"" but I'm honestly not entirely sure what that means.  SSL Certs or??

I THINK Clusterissuer is specific to kubernetes, so that will need to be replaced.  
I don' t know if I NEED Blocky and could just replace it with something like Pi-Hole.  
I used Tailscale on my Pre-TrueNAS setup, however I think WG-Easy is in place of that.  
I read a lot about Ngnix, and Traefik vs Ngnix.  Gist of what I got was that Traefik is easy to setup, and Nginx is harder, but you can have web pages (which may be needed for Home Assistant).  I could use some help here.

As far as setup, most of what I find when I search for TrueNAS and Traefik/Nginx pertains to Pre-Electric Eel so it isn't helpful.  Granted, I didn't do a super deep dive since I'm not entirely sure what I need.

I think the issue with needing to mess with the DNS on every device is from Blocky.  I THOUGHT that when I set up WG-Easy and set up Wireguard on a device that it would use the Blocky DNS when Wireguard is active, and only when needed.    
So if I were to take my laptop to a coffee shop, I can access the web fine without Wireguard, but I cannot access any of my services.  When I enable Wireguard I am able to access any of my services, and I can access the internet fine as well.

What ACTUALLY happens.... On my Windows 10 laptop, I have my DNS servers set to DNS1: <Blocky DNS IP> DNS2: [1.1.1.1](http://1.1.1.1)  
While at home I can access everything without issue (internet and my services), without Wireguard active (which is what I want/expect)  
However, when I leave the house I am unable to access the internet.  I have to remove the Blocky DNS and use something like [1.1.1.1](http://1.1.1.1) and [8.8.8.8](http://8.8.8.8) for DNS.  But when I enable Wireguard, I am unable to access my services.  If I leave the Block DNS I AND use Wireguard I can access my services, but no internet.  Right now my wife is threatening to shave my head and key my car over this.  
That said, I do not have that issue on my phone.  I have no private DNS set up on my phone, but I do need to enable Wireguard to access anything, even while at home.  
I wouldn't mind needing Wireguard at home, but I would think that would eat up my bandwidth, particularly while watching videos.  I also use Synergy for Keyboard/Mouse control across my laptop and desktop and if the network settings do not match it does not work so that is a concern.

Both of us are female. She’s a similar age to me as well which I think helped.   

Everything was going well, we’d chat about things other than my MH and she’d give advice on coping strategies based on my interests and things I already did. For the first time ever I felt like I’d found a therapist that worked, and it wasn’t all about me. We’d laugh and joke, we’d talk about TV programmes, my friends, my family etc. but it was always relevant to my MH and general well being.  

 A few days before Christmas we were just generally chatting about Christmas and how I celebrate etc. when therapist suddenly started telling me about herself. This isn’t unusual in itself, she’d always mention things about her own life; where she bought a jumper she was wearing if I’d commented on it, or if she’d tried the limited edition hot chocolate at my favourite coffee shop etc. which was fine and expected but this was different. She suddenly started talking about her family; siblings, parents, using her childrens names and ages (I didn’t even know she had children, she knows I do but I’ve never used their names or ages), telling me what her children do for hobbies, told me how old she was, and information about her children that was very identifying like enough information to google and find out their schools etc. It caught me completely off guard, it was unexpected and I’m sat thinking “why are you telling me this?”

 I’ve never asked her for this information, I don’t want to know it, it’s one thing to know if she’s tried the chocolate orange hot chocolate and enjoyed it (or not it was just chitchat) or that she’d watch the same TV programme as me so I could relate it to how I was feeling etc but I didn’t need personal information about her, I didn’t! Her name, registration number for the professional body she’s with and how to get hold of her to make appointments was enough for me. 

I left shortly after she told me all this as I felt awkward.   I’ve been back once since but it was just awkward and I don’t think I can go again. She’s not chasing me or harassing me for appointments but if she say bumps into me in the clinic she works in (it’s a big clinic with different doctors and departments so I’m there often) she’ll tell me I know how to get hold of her if I want to see her again.   But I don’t, unless it goes back to how it was. But it can’t so I don’t know what to do. I feel awkward almost embarrassed when I see her now. She just smiles at me and acts how she always has. Does anyone know why she said this?

1k8mt5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAmazingRace/comments/1k8mt5d/s37e8_fishermans_friend/,S37E8 ... Fisherman's Friend,"This was an absolutely fantastic episode of TAR. I really loved that they stayed in Bulgaria for another leg, as it’s an off-the-beaten-path sort of country which you don’t often hear about. Let’s break it down.

An express pass was up for grabs. It’s not incredibly fair that the location of the express pass was given at the beginning of the leg because the first team (Alyssa and Josiah) had a huge advantage to receive it. If it had been revealed later in the leg, there’s a chance another team could have overtaken A+J and also that we’d see more teams scrambling for the pass, which is always good drama.

As it was, we saw A+J walking over hot coals, which is something I’m not sure I could face personally. I read the board with the signs, and it sounds as if there was a demonstration beforehand. I can imagine the reasons why walking would be better than sprinting, and reading about the science of hot coal walking is pretty interesting. I would have liked to have seen that in the show about the technique but they didn’t have time to show us. Instead, we had Josiah talking about how he hates hot things and only drinks his hot chocolate lukewarm. I admit that hot drinks aren’t my favourite thing either: I don’t really like tea, coffee, or mulled wine, but I absolutely love hot chocolate.

Other teams began the leg and headed straight to Ariana Lake in a park in Sofia, where a bunch of men were engaging in a Jordan Day tradition… in the lake. After the Kukeri last episode… man, this country is full of interesting traditions. Teams had to retrieve a golden crucifix from the waist-high lake. Some teams said the lake was chilly… how long did those men have to stand in that lake for? Given that last-place gamers Carson and Jack left three hours behind team #2 and a whole hour behind team #5, I’m sure those men got to take a break… right? This seemed a rather easy challenge, but fun. They then received an envelope which told them they must not travel by taxi for the rest of the leg… which Erika promptly read as “Teams MUST travel by taxi”. She didn’t think that was a strangely worded clue? Maybe she was just reading what she wanted to read after the mayhem they had with the self-drive that morning.

Teams had to find a klek shop (or “kelk shop” as Erika called it), which I thought was an extremely neat clue. It was enjoyable watching teams get very confused by this challenge, where teams had no idea what to expect. The gamers had a miraculous coincidence when they got on the same bus as the log weight judge from the previous episode (who reminds me somewhat of the Fisherman’s Friend mascot with his big white beard). I was hooting with laughter at this, and so glad that the show decided to air this moment. They also had some help as they asked him what to expect from a klek shop. I thought it was a shame that the owner had to close her shop (to blend in and be inconspicuous) on a day she could have been busy, but then again, the show might have given her more than she would usually make in a day, plus the exposure can’t be a bad thing, right? A great route marker.

Then, off to another biblioteka to translate a verse from the Bible in “acrylic”. Brett and Mark breezed through this challenge and showed the way to success, which made it all the funnier when “escape room experts” Alyssa and Josiah struggled fruitlessly, almost climbing out of a window to find clues at one point. Yeah, it was as simple as turning the fucking thing over, but I can totally see how you simply might not think of that from looking at it.

Jon and Ana saw how to do it… then inexplicably decided to help J+A (just realised there are two J+A teams this year, darn it! Well, you know who I mean from context), which I thought was preposterous. Why would you help the team that has an express pass? They said they did it for karma, to hope some love would come back their way. It’s risky, and I just wish we’d see a bit more ruthlessness.

The trailing teams also struggled so fruitlessly that the gamers caught up, which I was incredibly excited to see. I love it when the unexpected happens. The gamers also figured out how to do the cipher (which must have been easy once you got the trick as all the racers got it in one, except for M+E who gave a hilarious series of letters to the bemused librarian), but were not as skilled at hiding it from Han Solo, who copied their homework…. After successfully getting it, they also did the ‘noble’ thing of telling M+E what to do to solve it. Noble, but potentially stupid, as they were battling for last place at that point. It could have been a fatal error.

Then, off to the Museum of Socialist Art (something I would absolutely love to see tbh if I ever go back to Sofia. Can’t believe I slept on that). Racing together, gamers and Han Solo seemed set on finding it until the gamers made the smart decision to ask a local, while Han Solo thought it would be better to just randomly run and hope they went the right way. Lordy. M+E, of course, got chauffeured to exactly where they needed to be, but somehow it didn’t help with their place in the race whatsoever.

No detour this leg, just a roadblock, which was pretty awesome to watch, beginning with the spoken introduction by Phil with the dancers behind him in a beautifully choreographed shot. One member of each team had to do a complex folk dance, and I was pretty impressed by how quickly all the teams managed it, even Melinda. They all looked stunning in their outfits too, and even got to wear them to race to the pit stop at the famous gold-domed Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, arguably Sofia’s most iconic structure.

In a leg without equalisers (FINALLY; this is a huge part of why I thought this leg was so good), it was pretty incredible that Carson and Jack raised themselves out of last place (remember they were more than an hour behind) and into fourth. Meanwhile, it was a huge womp-womp moment for M+E, who came last EVEN WITH all the taxis helping them. Fans might have been disappointed that we didn’t see them get hit with a massive penalty at the end, but I thought it was pretty fitting for a team that clearly no longer belonged in this race. I’ve enjoyed the spunk that M+E showed this race, and would love to see a stronger mother/daughter duo one day (I’m aware that Nancy and Emily from S1 still hold the record… man I wish they had tried a bit harder to beat the Guidos… they could have done it).

Even without a detour, this was an incredible leg with fun, cultural challenges, no annoying equalisers or weird gimmicks, just a leg that let this fascinating city speak for itself. I highly recommend a trip to Sofia if you can ever manage it.

I am looking to move to China in the near future and in preparation for that, I have a few questions ....  Your input would be greatly appreciated.

1. I am from Canada, and I have the Nespresso Vertuoline coffee machine.  I have lots of Nespresso pods and will be taking a few boxes with me.  I was wondering whether the pods I have for my Nespresso machine would also work/be compatible with the Vertuoline machine sold in China.  I tried contacting Nespresso China but could not get through...
2. I know the subject of VPN has been discussed, argued, commented a gazillion times, and it appears that right now, LetsVPN seems to be a good choice.  Astrill has often been suggested but my contact in China says it is reliabe only for the first few months, then it crashes (in addition to being pretty expensive).  I was instead directed to the 2 following VPNs - Shadowrocket or Heysocks VPN.  Has anyone used or had any long term experience with these 2 VPN brands?
3. Looks like my language school (of Xiamen University) will be located in the Xiang'an district (and not on the main island).  It was recommended that I live around the Guluo Park or surrounding neighborhoods (since there is absolutely nothing much going on living just across from the campus). I would like to connect with realtors BEFORE I arrive in Xiamen (in the middle of the hot and humid month of August!). Can anyone recommend or help me connect to local realtors around the Guluo Partk, Xiang'An district.
4. Finally, being from Canada, I already know that our electrical outlets are different than those in China. I will bring a few small appliances (hair dryer, electrical toothbrush, milk foamer) so I need to know which adapter/converter I need to buy so I can use these small equipments.

We also took a longer break halfway through in tje afternoon and went outside for a couple of hours to not waste the whole day. In the end we finished around 11 p.m. and while it was a hoot, at times it got a little mind-numbing as well, especially towards the end.

During the binge we also came up with an addition for the binge: you are only allowed to eat and drink what the doctors and nurses are eating and drinking or are implied to (like Whitaker taking a sandwich and putting it in his pocket) in each episode. We tried to make a list but probably missed things, especially if they happened at the background.

7 a.m. 
8 a.m. sandwich, energy drink
9 a.m. 
10 a.m. coffee
11 a.m.
12 p.m. snack bar, Primanti's sandwiches

14 a.m. protein bar?
15 a.m.
16 a.m.

17 a.m. pizza
18 a.m. coffee, ice coffee
19 a.m.
20 a.m. Kitkat bar, juicebox
21 a.m. sandwich, juicebox, coffee? beer

Maybe because if something happens to me, at least someone will know the truth.

My mom died two months ago.
Car accident.
She was coming home late from work when a drunk driver ran a red light.

It was sudden. Brutal.
No last words. No goodbyes.

I live alone now in the house we shared.
It’s too big for one person, but I can’t bring myself to leave yet.
Her stuff is still everywhere. Her shoes by the door. Her coffee mug in the sink. Her favorite blanket tossed over the couch.
Like she’s just out running errands, and any second now, she’ll walk through the door.

The first time I heard her, I thought I was dreaming.

It was around 3:30 a.m.
I woke up to the sound of her voice — faint, but unmistakable.

“Sweetheart? Can you come here?”

I sat up, heart racing.
It came from the basement.

I told myself it was just a dream.
Maybe I was half-asleep and imagined it.

The next night, it happened again.
Same time. Same voice.
Clearer.

“Come downstairs, honey. I need your help.”

I lay frozen in bed, staring at the ceiling.
I didn’t move.
I didn’t answer.

The basement door was closed — it always was — and I wasn’t about to open it.

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe grief does this. Maybe hearing her was just part of the process.
But it kept happening.

Every night.

Same voice. Same call.

And little by little, it changed.

At first, she sounded normal.
Then, the tone shifted — slower, heavier.
Like the voice was dragging itself through the words.

Three nights ago, when I didn’t respond, I heard footsteps coming up the basement stairs.
Soft, deliberate.
They stopped at the basement door.

And then… a knock.

Three slow, heavy knocks.

I didn’t move. I barely breathed.

The next morning, I found the basement door cracked open.
I know — I know — I locked it the night before.

Last night was the worst.

At exactly 3:30 a.m., I heard her again.

Only this time, she didn’t sound like my mom.

The voice was strained, broken, as if the words were too big for the mouth speaking them.

“Please. Come downstairs. It’s cold… and dark… and I can’t find my way back.”

I cried. I couldn’t help it.
It sounded so much like her… but it wasn’t her.
Not anymore.

I thought maybe if I ignored it, it would stop.

But it didn’t.

Tonight, it started early.
Not at 3:30 a.m.
It’s been calling since midnight.

And now… the basement door just creaked open by itself.
I can hear footsteps on the stairs again.

Slow. Heavy. Dragging.

The last thing I heard — just a few seconds ago — was her voice, closer now:

“If you won’t come down here… I’ll come up there.”

I’m sitting here, writing this, while the footsteps move closer to my room.

I don’t know if it’s her.
I don’t know if it’s something pretending to be her.

All I know is that whatever is outside my door right now…

I’m currently using a Nespresso machine but I’m ready to move on. I’m looking for a Breville semi-manual espresso machine that can give me equal or better results in terms of taste and consistency—without being overly complex or time-consuming. I drink espresso pretty much every morning, so I need something relatively quick, with a low margin for error.

I’m also trying to figure out if it’s even worth switching, considering I mostly drink traditional Italian espresso (single shots, around 7-9g baskets) and not the more common 17-18g double shots. Would a semi-manual still make sense for this kind of usage?

Capsules are getting on my nerves and I really want to start using fresh coffee beans. I did consider going the superautomatic route (like the DeLonghi Rivelia), but I get the impression that semi-manual machines offer better quality and potentially easier maintenance/cleaning in the long run.

So far, the machines I’ve been considering are the **Barista Express Impress** and the **Oracle Jet** (though that price tag is really steep).

She has sidestepped timelines like potholes in monsoon traffic, outgrown societal expectations politely but thoroughly, and once cried over a Parisian *macaron* that understood her better than most men on matrimonial apps. It’s been a journey.

Born in Bengaluru, raised in a rotating cast of Indian cities, she now lives in the sweet spot between *deeply grounded* and *delightfully unscripted*. She has lived across continents, answered to multiple versions of her name, but somehow, curd rice with lemon pickle still tastes like home.

Mostly because she drinks coffee. No sugar, strong, and with a silent prayer that no one makes her drink instant.

She’s made of soft rebellion and quiet conviction. Equal parts wanderlust and groundedness. She’ll know if your laugh is real, and she’ll likely notice if you’re pretending to like *Schubert*. 

She *can* make small talk. She just chooses not to. Because life’s too short to pretend to be impressed by someone’s LinkedIn headline. She’s the kind of person who asks questions that might make you pause. Not to challenge, but to understand.

* A soul trained in discernment, not drama.
* The ability to laugh at herself before anyone else gets the chance.
* A playlist that spans from *SD Burman* to silence, and makes you nostalgic for memories you never had.
* Loyalty, not out of obligation, but out of reverence for what’s real.
* Conversations that start on Tuesday and end somewhere on Friday afternoon.
* A love of beauty that shows up in how she folds laundry, chooses art, and watches sunsets like they’re personally performing for her.

She won’t request perfection. But she’ll invite *presence*. The real kind—the kind that notices the way her left eyebrow arches when she’s sceptical and how she goes quiet before saying something important.

**What she’s looking for:**

You’re emotionally available *and* occasionally hilarious. You’ve lived outside India—not just ticked off 20+ countries and called it 'global exposure'. You’ve actually built a life in a new place, done laundry in a language you didn’t speak, figured out public transport without panic, and found out what '*home*' means the hard way.

You’ve walked through your own fire. You don’t need rescuing or fixing, just someone to build something slowly and meaningfully with. You’re curious—not just about facts or newsfeeds, but about people, meaning, patterns, and why certain songs make you cry.

You won’t ask her to shrink or soften for your comfort or your idea of perfection.

You may not know your Monets from your Manets, but you’ll understand why she stands forever in front of a painting, whispering, “*Wasn’t that once a place we forgot to visit?*”

You believe in commitment—not because it’s expected, but because it’s earned. You don’t take yourself too seriously—because you know that life isn’t an exam, it’s more of a well-timed improv scene with questionable lighting. You laugh at your own typos. You can handle a burnt dosa without launching a full existential crisis.

And someday, maybe, you’ll raise a curious, slightly feral child together—one who eats a whole mango with joyful abandon, asks about Saturn’s rings before bedtime, and knows that love often looks like dancing badly to good music.

**What their life might look like:**

Rooted, but not rigid.  
A home where the bookshelves are a little chaotic, and bad jokes are traded without apology.  
Long drives/hikes where neither of them remembers the destination—but both remember the laughter.  
Arguments settled over too-salty *rasam*, stolen glances, and grudging, half-laughing truce offers scribbled on Post-it notes.  
Zero emotional games. One shared Google Calendar. Two backup coffees.

A home where silence is safe, curiosity is sacred, and the only thing more treasured than a good question is a truly terrible pun.

**Who should absolutely** ***not*** **message her:**

* Men seeking a checklist, a résumé, or a decorative plus-one—not a partner with her own pulse and poetry.
* Those who think 'radical honesty' means cruelty without consequence.
* Travel bros who confuse airport layovers with life experience.
* Performers who shine in crowds but flicker when the room holds only two people and the silence asks for truth.
* Men whose egos are so large they crowd out tenderness—and who mistake winning an argument for building a life.
* Anyone looking for someone to complete their performance, not co-create their imperfect, quietly extraordinary life.

**But if you want a partner, not a performance**,  
know that life is better when you laugh in the middle of a fight,  
and if you’ve outgrown the need to *win* and just want to be real -  
she might just be the woman your nani warned you about:  
clever, kind, and entirely unwilling to settle for anything less than the real thing.

Please reach out via DM. *Spare her the tepid ‘hello'.* Bring a story, a thoughtful question that makes her sit up, a little chaos. She’ll bring the shortbread, and the wit.  

She knows finding her person is somewhere between *improbable* and *poetic*—a kind of cosmic treasure hunt with no guarantees.  
Still, she leaves this little piece of herself here, like a lantern drifting into a wide, wild sky.  
Maybe you’ll find her—or maybe she just needed to leave a light on.

*Profile co-written with ChatGPT. J usually pens words that make people pause—but this time, she invited a co-conspirator with a flair for metaphors and mischief. No regrets. Except maybe one semi-colon.*",1,1745699217.0,reddmatch,2,0.67,False

Hello, for the past 4 months, my parents have been embroiled in a nasty divorce. My father is very vindictive, gaslighty, and unstable and has a history of horrible anger issues where he'd scream and sometimes throw things. He kept goading my mom into doing something worthy of being arrested, she lost her temper and spilled coffee on him which gave him grounds to call the police and get her arrested, allowing him to file a restraining order.

  
He is trying to do the same to me. While my mom was being arrested, he lied to the cops, saying I was very violent and trying to hurt him to get me kicked out. The same day he got my mom arrested, he called the cops on me when I got home and immedietly as I began insulting him. The same cops came, tried to mediate the situation, they left, he called immedietlly again, insisting I was very violent and attacking him. I have never threatened him or hit him, he's completely lying. During that call, he also tried to claim I stole the car he bought me despite being on the insurance. He also testified against me in the arraignment against my mom, trying to claim I was violent and he needed one against me as well, but the judge denied his requet.

  
I recorded the two 911 calls he made on me. I also have texts the reify a previous incident where when he was blocking the drive way and refusing to leave despite asking politely, he kept trying to get me to be physical so he could call the cops. It's very clear he's harassing me and making my life hell. I am wondering if I have enough grounds to file a harrassment protection order against him.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of personalized cups for a wedding involves considering various features that influence their appeal, functionality, and longevity.

**Material Quality:** The material of the cup significantly impacts its durability and appearance. Options range from plastic and paper to glass and stainless steel. Plastic cups are cost-effective and suitable for casual events, while glass and stainless steel offer a more sophisticated look for formal receptions. The quality of the material should be robust enough to withstand use throughout the event and potentially be reused by guests afterward.

The choice of material often depends on the wedding's style and budget. Plastic is ideal for outdoor weddings, while glass elevates the ambiance of an indoor formal gathering. Selecting a material that reflects the overall theme and ensures the cups are long-lasting is vital.

**Customization Options:** Personalization is the core of these cups, making the range of customization options crucial. Options include engraving, printing, and embossing. The type of printing, whether it is screen printing, digital printing, or laser engraving, also affects the clarity and permanence of the design. The availability of various fonts, colors, and graphics enables couples to match the cups to their wedding theme.

Some vendors provide design templates, while others offer fully custom design services. The flexibility in customization allows for the inclusion of names, dates, monograms, and custom artwork, making each cup a unique memento of the special occasion.

**Size and Style Variety:** The size and style of the cups should align with the beverages served at the wedding. Options include stemless wine glasses, mason jars, coffee mugs, and traditional tumblers. The capacity of the cups should be appropriate for the drinks being offered, whether it's water, wine, cocktails, or coffee. The style should complement the overall aesthetic of the wedding, ranging from rustic and vintage to modern and elegant.

The availability of different styles ensures that couples can select cups that are both functional and visually appealing. Different sizes can accommodate various drinks while keeping with the theme.

**Durability and Reusability:** Given the growing emphasis on sustainability, the durability and reusability of the cups are important considerations.

Opting for durable and reusable materials is not only environmentally conscious but also offers better value in the long run. Reusable cups can become cherished keepsakes that guests can continue to use, reminding them of the wedding for years to come.

**Printing Technology:** The type of printing technology used directly impacts the quality and longevity of the design on the cups. Screen printing is a cost-effective option for large quantities, while digital printing offers greater detail and color accuracy. Laser engraving provides a permanent and elegant touch, especially on glass or stainless steel cups.

The choice of printing technology depends on the material of the cup and the complexity of the design. High-quality printing ensures that the personalization remains intact even after repeated use and washing.

So I am spending a ton of time defusing meltdown and preventing overstim and wipe out. Every single day I have a certain coffee with cinnamon, an apple, a protein yogurt, and a protein granola bar. I cant imagine eating anything else, like at all.

I actually made dinner for my family several times and then sat at the table with them and ate yogurt and an apple.  We order in, go out, doesn't matter. Apple, yogurt, protein bar. 

I think my hypersensitivity has peaked because I am getting more and more stressed. Does anyone else do this? It's almost intolerable.

I also have a history of hypersensitive sense of smell, but that has gotten so much **more** lately too. I was making pesto pasta for my kids lunch and I had to leave the kitchen so she could put the pesto sauce on the pasta because the smell was absolutely sending me. 🤮",6,1745698836.0,AutisticAdults,4,1.0,False

I'm a 28-year-old female (turning 29 next month!) who recently moved back to Vancouver after spending most of my twenties away for school and work. I had been living and practicing in the US for the past few years, and while I’m lucky to have a close family here, I realized I don’t really have many friends left in the city.

I'm genuinely excited to be back though — I absolutely love Vancouver. Every time I look up and see the mountains, or walk through downtown, I’m reminded why this place has my heart.

A little about me:

I’m currently working from home and studying for some licensing exams, so my days are a mix of busy and flexible.

I love trying new things — fitness classes, creative workshops (like pottery or painting), random outings, you name it!

I like walking to different food spots (partly to burn off all the delicious calories I just ate lol).

I don’t drink a ton but I’m always down for a good cocktail or two with great company, whether it's a chill night or a fun night out.

I really enjoy nightlife — I love hitting clubs, bars, or lounges, especially with like-minded girls who are just looking to dance, laugh, and make some awesome memories (no hookup culture here).

I also love going to concerts. My playlist is a chaotic mix — one minute it’s UK rap, the next it’s country music. I believe good music is just good music!

I’m a pretty open-minded and positive person, and always willing to try (almost) anything at least once, as long as it’s safe.

If you’re also looking for a friend to grab food with, explore the city, go dancing, take a pottery class, or just hang out and study together at a coffee shop, feel free to message me! 😊💕🎀

Would love to meet some genuine, fun girls to build a friendship with!",3,1745698763.0,Vancouver4Friends,3,0.71,False

Me, 26f and my boyfriend, 27M are both teachers and we actually work at the same school. We’ve been together almost a year now. He is a very jealous person in general and really possessive over me. I was telling him that I found a note from my former 4th grade student from last year saying that he wants to meet up with me again when he’s 20 to catch up. I’m really close with my students so I always tell them that they can come visit or say hi when they’re older. When I read this to him, he said “That’s so weird he would say that. You’re not going to do that.” I started asking how that was weird, and he said that’s just weird to meet alone with a boy even if it’s my former student and that he’d never allow me to do that. I began to say it’s not weird at all and I love my students and want to always be open to them coming to say hi! He yelled at me and asked “so you’re gonna do something I asked you not to??” 

I left the house because I was so upset and he said I was being extremely disrespectful. He started texting me saying he doesn’t want me coming to the wedding we’ve been planning to go to today, Saturday. 

I have a tendency of thinking I’m always wrong in situations like this.

There's a lot of content to go through, so I've been studying every day (6 to 9 hours a day, depending on my motivation). However, after every three or four days with intense focus, there will be a day where I majorly slack off - I still try to get out of my room to go to a coffee shop or library to study, but I just can't focus and get really distracted, I take excessively long breaks, and before I know it, it's night time and I just want to chill out on my bed ... The next day, I usually feel really guilty for slacking off so the shame pushes me back to focusing.

Gets with Max, leaves Max days before their wedding, doesn't even bother to ever call him. See's Max a year later and is upset because he acts very polite and pleasant towards her. Also cheats on coffee shop guy with Max.

I know there's hate for Christopher in this group, but she never wanted him then the moment he enters into a new relationship, blames him for not being able to keep and maintain a relationship herself.

But don't get me started on Luke. Even before they enter into a relationship, she's so disrespectful of him in general. Being pushy and never taking no for an answer, going behind his counter, at his place of business, multiple times and taking what she wants. Taking over his diner without even asking when the inn burns down, blaming him for Jess' actions, telling Luke that he should have put her and Rory before his own nephew. Putting herself into his business constantly.

And then she cheated on him, yes I understand the whole April storyline was a big thing, but did she need to go and sleep with someone?

I get it, she's cute and quirky and adorable and all the good things. But we all know her treatment of men is pretty garbage.",0,1745698451.0,GilmoreGirls,7,0.13,False
1k8m2e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1k8m2e2/paying_to_decrease_cheaters_is_a_scam_and/,"Paying to ""decrease cheaters"" is a scam and companies know it (rant)","Paying to "" decrease cheaters"" is a scam , and companies know it

Why the hell should I have to pay for a premium account in CS:GO or TF2 just to play ranked matches?
Valve expects me to believe that ""Prime"" matchmaking decreases cheaters? It doesn’t. It just moves them around.

Or paying for PlayStation Plus just to play some tiny online games like Crash Bash?
Who the hell is hacking in Crash Bash? No one. It’s just another excuse to make online a paid feature.

Companies like Valve, Sony, Riot — they aren’t offering ""better service,"" they’re selling you a basic experience that should have been standard in the first place.
You’re not paying for a bonus — you’re paying to avoid a broken system they refuse to fix properly.

Last night in CS, I had a teammate literally say in global voice: ""Yo CT and T side, turn off cheats, let's play a good game.""
This is where we are now. People just openly admit it and nobody even cares. Valve sure as hell doesn’t.

And on consoles it’s just as pathetic. You spend $60+ on a game on PlayStation and still have to pay extra just to use features that are already on the disc.
It’s like going to a coffee shop, buying a drink, and being told you need to pay extra to use the straw. Absolute joke.

And then there’s the kernel-level spyware they call ""anti-cheat.""
You can’t even play Rainbow Six Siege on Linux because Ubisoft’s anti-cheat demands access to your entire system.
Meanwhile, every five minutes the servers proudly announce another ban wave like that somehow fixes anything. It doesn’t. The cheaters are still there.

Riot’s Vanguard blocks Linux users too unless you give it access to the most sensitive parts of your system.
Tencent — the company behind Marvel Rivals, COD Mobile, and PUBG Mobile — openly scans your files on Android.
They call it ""anti-cheat,"" but it’s just surveillance for profit. I don’t care how ""limited"" they claim it is — it’s a complete violation of privacy.

I’m sick of hearing ""just trust us.""
No. I don’t trust Tencent. I don’t trust Valve. I don’t trust Riot. I don’t trust Ubisoft.
Not when they’re making billions while players are forced to pay more just for the chance at a normal experience.

Is anyone else fed up with this trash system, or is it just me?

Confused After Mixed Signals — Need Fellow Aquas’ Insights!,"My Aquarius Person of Interest: Aqua Sun, Taurus moon, Pisces Venus, aquarius mars, aquarius mercury. He is 30 years old male with a secured professional life and is popular for his achievements in life.

Me: Virgo Sun, sagittarius moon, Leo venus, Aries rising. I am 25 year old female with a moderate job life, few small achievements but I am ambitious and I look forward to be an entrepreneur in my coming days.


We were added in social media for many years, adored each others like acquaintance. He would often reach out once a year and mostly prefers calls over texts. But he was always inconsistent and I had other crushes or situationships going on in the background so I never paid much attention to him other than respecting him and adoring him.
However, this year he actually asked me out and I was available so I went out with him for a coffee date. He was surprisingly very charming, very blunt about himself, flirted heavily and tricked me into holding hands and we almost kissed. Then after coming back home we ended up sexting a little bit too. He asked me out for a second date.
Note: He mentioned multiple times during and before the date that he has a pretty demanding job which is true . He even explained why and how. Also said, people perceive him to be all into money making but he really just have some bucket list of dreams and he just wanna retire early.

However, after the romantic date and steamy snapping he vanished. The second date never happened. I was careful in making initiatives because I was reading too much about aquarius needing space etc. and that he is a busy guy.  But it's been more than a month now, big holidays went by but he still has not made any move.


Here's some bullet points:

We met about a month ago and had a deep, meaningful connection — but haven’t talked properly since then.
- He’s generally socially distant, selective, ambitious, and keeps his personal life very private.
- Today, he posted a simple interview clip on social media. I was the first person to react about 25 minutes after he posted it.
- Right after that, I gathered courage and called him. He picked up instantly — but the network was bad, and neither of us could hear each other properly.
- I said, “Let me try calling you back.” I called again — but this time he didn’t pick up and hasn’t called back yet.
- Later, I checked and saw that he deleted the post from his profile.
- also I can see he deleted his Snapchat account 

Now I’m just really confused.  And looks fishy to me. Honestly I feel like someone would do that of they got a wife at home to hide things from lmao. Sorryyy but I am just feeling very weird. He is not ghosting me entirely. Orbiting around but not letting me in at the same time. So wtf can possibly be going on? Is it normal for aquarius to behave like that or have i git myself intrigued by another cold fuckboy type?
