[Carney says a U.S. trade deal](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/carney-trade-deal-tariffs-unlikely-1.7585280) without some tariffs is unlikely. Prime Minister Mark Carney said Tuesday U.S. President Donald Trump seems wedded to tariffs and any trade deal with the Americans may include accepting some levies on exports. Speaking to reporters ahead of a cabinet meeting on Parliament Hill about the trade war, Carney said in French that all of Trump's trade agreements to this point have included some tariffs. He said ""there's not a lot of evidence right now"" that the U.S. is willing to cut a deal without some tariffs included. Indeed, Trump's trade arrangement with the U.K., a country with which the U.S. has a trading surplus, includes a 10 per cent baseline tariff.

[Carney heads to Hamilton to meet steelworkers](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/carney-heads-to-hamilton-to-meet-steelworkers-as-us-trade-talks-continue/) as U.S. trade talks continue. Prime Minister Mark Carney is scheduled to be in Hamilton today to make an announcement related to the steel industry. It has been more than a month since U.S. President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum from 25 to 50 per cent, adding further economic insult to the two industries in Canada. Carney met with his cabinet virtually on Tuesday and told reporters before that meeting he doesn’t think Trump will agree to any trade deals without including some tariffs. Carney will tour a steel company in the city and meet with workers during his visit to Hamilton.

[9 First Nations ask court to strike down federal, Ontario bills](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/first-nations-court-federal-ontario-bills-infrastructure-1.7585443) allowing infrastructure fast-tracking. Nine First Nations in Ontario are seeking a court-ordered injunction that would prevent the federal and provincial governments from using newly passed laws to fast-track infrastructure projects. The constitutional challenge states provincial Bill 5 and federal Bill C-5 ""both represent a clear and present danger"" to the First Nations, which include Attawapiskat, Fort Albany and Apitipi. The First Nations argue both pieces of legislation authorize ""the Crown to unilaterally ram through projects without meaningful or any engagement with First Nations"" and ""violate the constitutional obligation of the Crown to advance ... reconciliation.""

[Alberta Premier Danielle Smith suggests premiers](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-premier-danielle-smith-suggests-premiers-start-constitutional-talks-1.7585083) start constitutional talks. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith says it could be time for premiers to hold another constitutional convention. At the province's first Alberta Next panel town hall meeting in Red Deer Tuesday evening, the premier gauged the crowd's appetite for getting other premiers together in a room to discuss reopening the constitution. ""There is a real appetite to fix some of these things that are just foundational,"" Smith said near the end of the meeting. Canada hasn't engaged in formal constitutional negotiations since 1992, when the premiers and then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney failed to get Quebec to sign on to the 1982 constitution in the Charlottetown Accord negotiations. The risk of reopening the constitution, Smith said, is that other provinces could attempt to include changes that Albertans may not want.

[Inflation rate rose slightly to 1.9% in June](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/inflation-rate-june-1.7585178) as vehicle and clothing prices climb. The pace of inflation sped up to 1.9 per cent in the month of June as costs for cars and clothes increased, Statistics Canada said Tuesday. Passenger vehicles prices rose significantly in June — rising 4.1 per cent year over year, compared to a 3.2 per cent increase in May. Used passenger vehicles had their first year-over-year increase in 18 months, according to Statistics Canada. New cars also increased in price, with the inflation rate climbing to 5.2 per cent in May. Costs for clothing and footwear accelerated last month, rising two per cent year over year in June. Statistics Canada says that came as a result of tariff uncertainty hitting the clothing industry in particular.

**United States:**

[US sends migrants to Eswatini after ban lifted](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/16/trump-administration-deports-five-migrants-to-eswatini-in-southern-africa) on third-country deportations. A flight carrying immigrants deported from the US has landed in Eswatini, the homeland security department announced, in a move that follows the supreme court lifting limits on deporting migrants to third countries. In a post online, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin named five deportees from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba and Yemen and said they were convicted of crimes ranging from child rape to murder. “A safe third country deportation flight to Eswatini in Southern Africa has landed. This flight took individuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back,” McLaughlin said late on Tuesday. In late June, the US supreme court cleared the way for president Donald Trump’s administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their own without offering them a chance to show the harms they could face. The decision handed the government a win in its aggressive pursuit of mass deportations.

[Pete Hegseth orders the removal of 2,000 National Guard troops](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pete-hegseth-national-guard-troops-los-angeles-rcna218995) from Los Angeles. The deployment of 4,000 National Guard troops came after a series of raids by immigration authorities in Los Angeles prompted sometimes-violent protests in parts of the city that were quelled with arrests and the use of ""less lethal"" weapons. The Trump administration's decision to deploy the troops drew fierce criticism from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who called it an ""assault"" on Democracy and invoked ""authoritarian regimes"" who ""begin by targeting people who are least able to defend themselves."" Los Angeles Mayor Mayor Bass has also been vocal about her opposition to the deployment of National Guard troops, calling it an unnecessary overreach. In a statement Tuesday, she said the troops' removal “happened because the people of Los Angeles stood united and stood strong. We organized peaceful protests, we came together at rallies, we took the Trump administration to court — all of this led to today’s retreat.""

[Senate Republicans advance Trump bill to cancel $9bn](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/15/senate-republicans-trump-cancel-spending) in approved spending. Senate Republicans on Tuesday advanced Donald Trump’s request to cancel about $9bn in previously approved spending, overcoming concerns about what the rescissions could mean for impoverished people around the globe and for public radio and television stations in their home states. JD Vance broke the tie on the procedural vote, allowing the measure to advance, 51-50. A final vote in the Senate could occur as early as Wednesday. The bill would then return to the House for another vote before it would go to the US president’s desk for his signature before a Friday deadline. Republicans winnowed down the president’s request by taking out his proposed $400m cut to a program known as Pepfar. That change increased the prospects for the bill’s passage. The politically popular program is credited with saving millions of lives since its creation under then president George W Bush to combat HIV/Aids. Trump is also looking to claw back money for foreign aid programs targeted by his so-called “department of government efficiency” and for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

[Trump tries to move on amid Epstein files backlash](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jul/16/donald-trump-epstein-files-jd-vance-us-politics-live-news-updates) as speaker calls for their release. Donald Trump has dismissed a secretive inquiry into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as “boring” and of interest only to “bad people”, but said he backed the release of any “credible” files, as he sought to stamp out a conspiracy-fuelled uproar among his supporters. The US president is facing a political crisis within his usually loyal Republican “Make America great again” (Maga) base over suspicion that the administration is hiding details of Epstein’s crimes to protect the rich elite he associated with, which included Trump. One of the most dramatic theories circulating among supporters is that Epstein – who killed himself in 2019 while in federal custody – was murdered by powerful figures to cover up their roles in his sex crimes against children. “I don’t understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case would be of interest to anybody,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday night when asked why his supporters are so interested in the case. “It’s pretty boring stuff. It’s sordid, but it’s boring, and I don’t understand why it keeps going. “I think really only pretty bad people, including fake news, want to keep something like that going,” he added. “But credible information, let them give it. Anything that is credible, I would say, let them have it.”

US House speaker [Mike Johnson calls for release of Epstein files](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/15/epstein-files-republicans-mike-johnson) amid backlash. Mike Johnson, speaker of the House, called for the justice department to make public documents related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, breaking with Donald Trump over an issue that has roiled the president’s rightwing base. It was a rare moment of friction between Trump and the speaker, a top ally on Capitol Hill, and came as the president faces growing backlash from conservatives who had expected him to make public everything known about Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 while in federal custody as he faced sex-trafficking charges.

[ICE detains father in Washington state;](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/ice-detains-father-in-washington-state-pregnant-wife-pleads-i-just-want-him-home/ar-AA1IFKm3) pregnant wife pleads, 'I just want him home'. On Friday morning, Guilherme Lemes Cardoso E Silva was on his way to pick up his daughter in Friday Harbor on San Juan Island, about 100 miles north of Seattle, when multiple unmarked ICE vehicles containing masked agents stopped him on a private road near his home, according to his wife, Rachel Leidig. Silva has no criminal record or outstanding warrants, Leidig said. Silva and Leidig were working with an immigration attorney and in the process of submitting an application to legalize his residency status in the U.S. when Silva was detained. After his detainment, Leidig submitted an I-130 form, or a ""petition for alien relative."" He was also in the process of renewing his work permit, Leidig said. According to Leidig, Silva told her that the ICE agents who detained him were rough with him and refused to show him a warrant. One agent confiscated his phone when he began recording the incident and others were making jokes during his arrest, she said.

[US inflation rose in June](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/15/us-inflation-june-trump-tariffs) as Trump’s tariffs start to show in prices. Business leaders have said for months that the high, volatile rates of Trump’s tariffs will force companies to raise consumer prices. Prices remained stable in the spring, particularly as many of Trump’s highest tariffs were paused; however, they started increasing in May and have continued to rise in June. Annual inflation rose to 2.7% in June, up from 2.4% in May, according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the prices of a basket of goods and services each month. Core CPI, which leaves out energy and food prices, ticked up slightly to 2.9%, compared with 2.8% in May. The prices of appliances, furniture and toys, products typically manufactured outside the US, all rose. Food prices increased by 3%, with the price of beef rising by more than 2% over the month, coffee up 2.2% and citrus fruit prices rising 2.3%. While the price of eggs has been dropping over the last few months, a dozen eggs are still 27% more expensive than last year.

[Trump threatens to impose drug and chip tariffs](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/16/trump-threatens-drug-pharmaceuticals-chip-tech-tariffs-august) as soon as 1 August. Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on pharmaceutical products and semiconductors as soon as 1 August, the latest deadline for the introduction of his “reciprocal” levies on individual countries. The US president told reporters late on Tuesday the taxes on drug imports could be announced “probably at the end of the month, and we’re going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build, and then we’re going to make it a very high tariff”. He added he had a similar timeline for imposing levies on semiconductors, as he believed it was “less complicated” to implement tariffs on the chips required by all electronic devices, but did not provide further details.

Trump's [Texas-sized redistricting](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trumps-texas-sized-redistricting-dreams-politics-desk-rcna218981) dreams. President Donald Trump is setting a lofty goal for Texas Republicans as they prepare to tackle redrawing their congressional maps: He wants the party to pick up five House seats as a result of the process.“A very simple redrawing, we pick up five seats,” Trump told reporters. That could prove to be a tall order, as Republicans already control 25 of Texas’ 38 congressional districts. The specific areas the GOP could target when they take up redistricting in next week’s special legislative session remain unclear. But two of them could be the Democratic-held South Texas districts that Trump won in 2024. According to an analysis by NBC News’ Decision Desk, Trump carried Rep. Henry Cuellar’s district by 7 points and Rep. Vicente Gonzalez’s district by 4 points last year. Cuellar won his seat by less than 6 points, while Gonzalez won by less than 3 points.

[Gen Z is right about the job hunt](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/careersandeducation/gen-z-is-right-about-the-job-hunt-it-really-is-worse-than-it-was-for-millennials-with-nearly-60-of-fresh-faced-grads-frozen-out-of-the-workforce/ar-AA1IAeg1)—it really is worse than it was for millennials, with nearly 60% of fresh-faced grads frozen out of the workforce. Gen Z’s suspicion that the job hunt is harder than ever may be true—about 58% of recent graduates are still looking for full-time work, compared to 25% of earlier graduates, like millennials, Gen Xers, and baby boomers before them. Young job-hunters are also three times less likely to have a job lined up out of school, as AI agents take over and entry-level roles are shrinking for Gen Z workers. Gen Z is slammed for complaining about how tough it is to work five days in-office, or even get a job in the first place—but their suspicions may be true. Research has confirmed, their older millennial critics had a far easier time locking down a gig to begin with. About 58% of students who graduated within the last year are still looking for their first job, according to a recent report from Kickresume. Meanwhile, just 25% of graduates in previous years—such as their millennial and Gen X predecessors—struggled to land work after college.

At least [20 killed in stampede at Gaza food distribution site.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mideast-gaza-ghf-site-deaths-1.7586101) At least 20 Palestinians were killed on Wednesday at an aid distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), in what the U.S.-backed group said was a crowd surge instigated by armed agitators. The GHF, which is supported by Israel, said 19 people were trampled and another fatally stabbed during the crush at one of its centres in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. ""We have credible reason to believe that elements within the crowd — armed and affiliated with Hamas — deliberately fomented the unrest,"" GHF said in a statement. Palestinian health officials told Reuters people had died of suffocation at the site. One medic said lots of people had been crammed into a small space and had been crushed.",1,1752675042.0,CANUSHelp,0,1.0,False
1m1dleh,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1m1dleh/i_hate_my_husbands_morning_hobbies/,I hate my husband's morning hobbies,"I am NOT a morning person. Everyone in my life knows this. I am grouchy, short tempered and not nice to be around. I hate noise and people talking at me in the morning. I want to wake up slowly, at my own pace, and make my coffee and drink it and have breakfast before I have to deal with anything. It's not a realistic need with kids.   
      
My husband however is a morning person. He's happy and chipper and extremely annoying to be around in the morning. Yet through my kids baby/toddler/preschool years it was always ME who was up with the kids at the asscrack of dawn.  
    
My youngest is eight. He's a morning person in the extreme. In theory he doesn't need me to be up when he is. But despite my efforts to have food he can make/grab himself available he never wants that. Or he will want me to watch while he makes something. And then he'll want more food. This boy will have like three meals worth before I even get a chance to feed myself.  And even though I am not strict about screentime *especially* in the morning when I want him to use it the most he's just not happy unless he's in my face and getting 100% of my attention and whining constantly. So I'm always snapping at him and feeling bad about it.   
    
For a short time this summer my husband was finally  dealing with son in the morning and keeping him out of my hair. It was really helpful because once the day starts proper it's me dealing with son all day until I put him to bed (yes, I do 90% of bedtimes to). I try to keep him active and have lots of appointments so once I get going it's pretty nonstop most days so I really liked being able to start morning at my own pace and sometimes even remembering to eat a substantial breakfast and have coffee.    
     
But I still had a breakdown this summer and I told husband that I was deeply burned out. He said that he was burned out too and that his job was ""suffering"" because he was tired from getting up with son. Ever since then he's always talking about how he's ""so godamned tired all the time"".   
     
He runs in the mornings. Used to be he'd get up and run around 6 a few times a week. Which was kind of annoying because he wouldn't always be around when I needed him but it wasn't super bad. Then he started learning a language on Duolingo and he spends a godamned hour on it in the mornings and another in the evenings. So now he gets up, spends an hour on Duolingo on the deck where son doesn't see him and the goes and runs at 7 for an hour or more, leaving me completely on the hook for any and all child related things.   
     
 But for some reason he never blames *those* things like running an hour in the summer heat or using a ton of brain power learning a new language for making him tired--it has to be the being available to deal with son at a time he's already up anyway that's making him exhausted 🙄",1,1752675018.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

1m1djmc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m1djmc,"Vales, Isle and Biomes! Oh My!","Hello, 

A few days ago I shared a picture of my coffee shop on The Bind bridge and got a lot of positive feedback. So I thought I would share some other areas I’ve made in the game. 

I know I’m not breaking the mould here 🤣 but I’m now in the building mode of the game rather than playing it. The pictures are some of my personal favourites. 

I would love your feedback. Feel free to take inspiration for your own. (Also some biomes need a clean up so apologies in advance)

Picture 1) Plaza and Peaceful Meadow. The plaza is full of rides. These will eventually blend into the right side of the peaceful meadow. In the peaceful meadow we have Toon Town for Mickey and friends on the left. Main Street running down to dazzle beach in the centre. And a market stall area to the right. 

Picture 2) The Wastes and The Borderlands of Eternity Isle(DLC). Jasmine and Aladdin’s home sits in the Wastes surrounded by Agrabah walls, and overlooks the Agrabah market stalls which lead up to the palace. 

Picture 3) The Docks of Eternity Isle(DLC) is the home to Moana. I used a lot of foliage and trees to transform this area and hide some of the Isle’s futuristic look. To the left you can see a statue of Maui. His grotto sits out in the water. 

Picture 4) The Forest of Valour hosts Belle and Beast’s castle. I love this area at night as I have placed candelabras on top of the turrets which glow in the darkness. Often I’ll buy up roses and drop them around the castle grounds. 

Picture 5) The Bind, Storybook Vale(DLC). As mentioned above, my little coffee/book/plant shop sits on the bridge overlooking The Bind. 

Picture 6) The Wild Wood, Storybook Vale(DLC) is a great area for my Curious Labyrinth. Inside I have dropped random items from across all three lands including a cartoon trolley, a skeleton’s Christmas tree and of course a table for celebrating unbirthdays. This leads perfectly to Teacup Falls where you can find Alice and the Cheshire Cat. 

Picture 7) The Fallen Fortress, Storybook Vale(DLC). Neverland. I will add some more pictures of this in the comments. I have an area for the Indian Camp, Mermaid Lagoon Pan’s House, and some pirate treasure. Spent a pretty penny on that River Kit. 

If you got this far. Thank you. Please share screenshots of your biomes and designs. Would love some more inspiration.

We've been friends forever, like since elementary school, mostly 'cause we were both the dorks who actually liked going to the library. Anyway, Carl always had this… vibe. Like he was hearing stuff no one else could. I just thought he was, you know, being all artsy. But nope. I was so, so wrong.
Part 1: The Old House Talk
It all started a few weeks ago. Carl and I were chilling at our usual coffee place, the one with the gross, chipped mugs and the barista who always looks like he just saw a ghost. Carl was being super weird, like, more than usual.
""Dude, you hear about them tearing down that old Peterson house on Elm Street?"" he asked, just stirring his coffee, which, by the way, he never drinks black.
I just shrugged. ""Yeah, I saw that. Good riddance, that place was a total dump.""
Carl looked up then, and his eyes were, like, huge. ""A dump? Nah, man. That place was… important. To me, anyway."" He took this huge breath, and I could tell he was trying to, like, tell me something big. ""That was my house when I was a little kid, before my parents moved us. That’s where… everything started.""
He started messing with a loose string on his sleeve. ""My parents were always busy, you know? Always. Even when they were home, they weren't, like, there. So I was alone a lot. And that's when Nole started showing up.""
I was like, ""Nole? Who even is that?""
Carl just shook his head, and he had this weird, kinda creepy smile. ""He was my friend. He just, like, appeared at my window. Only when I was alone."" He stopped talking and looked out the window, where it was raining. ""Nobody believed me, obviously. I tried to tell my parents once. They just said I had, like, a 'wild imagination.'"" He chuckled, but it wasn't a funny sound. ""If only they knew, right?""

Last year, my dad had a mild heart attack at 58. He'd been ""perfectly healthy"" according to his annual checkups. After that scare, our whole family became paranoid about heart health. But here's the thing - getting regular ECGs or wearing a heart monitor 24/7 isn't realistic for most of us.

I started simple: checking my pulse manually every morning. But I kept forgetting, and when I did remember, I wasn't sure if I was counting correctly. My readings were all over the place - 65 one day, 95 the next. Was that normal variation or was I just bad at counting?

Then I discovered you can actually use your phone's camera to measure heart rate (same technology as those finger pulse oximeters at the hospital). I started taking 30-second readings every morning after coffee. The consistency helped me establish my baseline: usually 68-72 bpm at rest.

Here's where it gets interesting: After three months of daily tracking, I noticed my resting heart rate creeping up. From my usual 70 to 75, then 78, then staying around 80-82. I felt fine, but the numbers told a different story.

I also noticed my heart rate variability (HRV) dropping. I learned that HRV is like a health score for your nervous system - higher is generally better. Mine went from 45ms to 32ms over two weeks.

Armed with this data, I went to my doctor. She almost dismissed it until I showed her three months of daily readings. The patterns made her order additional tests. Turns out I had developed subclinical hyperthyroidism - my thyroid was overactive but not enough to show symptoms yet.

Catching it early meant simple medication instead of more serious interventions later. My cardiologist said the consistent daily monitoring was key - a single reading at an annual checkup would've missed it.

What I learned:

* Your ""normal"" is unique to you - you need baseline data
* Trends matter more than individual readings
* Consistency beats accuracy (same time, same conditions daily)
* HRV might be even more important than heart rate
* Don't dismiss gradual changes just because you ""feel fine""

I now take 30 seconds every morning for a reading. It's become as routine as brushing my teeth. My resting heart rate is back to 68-70, and my HRV is climbing back up.

For anyone wanting to start monitoring, you don't need expensive equipment. I use an app called BPCare AI (it's on iPhone, not sure about Android). But honestly, even manually checking your pulse daily is better than nothing. The key is consistency and watching for trends.

Has anyone else caught health issues through routine monitoring? I'm curious if others have similar experiences.

Stay heart-healthy, everyone. ❤️",1,1752674668.0,Cardiophobias,0,1.0,False

I was wondering if anyone can help identify what is happening in my office at home. I attached some photos...

I know you might've been thinking I dropped a mug of coffee or soda and it splattered all over the place but that is not the case. It reappears every so often after I wipe the areas with a wet towel. FYI, it doesn't smell or isn't sticky either...

What do you guys think this is? Any feedback is welcome, thank you everyone!

The Peru Geisha was more expensive 31 for 200g as opposed to 24, and i was expecting it to be better than the Colombia geisha, however, after brewing both bags for a few days (about 2.5 - 3 weeks post roast) i think i like the Colombia geisha much more, it's much more vibrant, floral, and has a almost cotton candylike sweetness to it without being funky, whereas the peru geisha is super clean, and i get a very nice juicy lemon and bergamot in it, but it's not as vibrant as the Colombia geisha, i guess price doesn't always equate to my personal enjoyment.

Recently, a friend of mine — a total tech enthusiast and blockchain geek — stumbled upon a surprisingly effective way to make money. At first, he kept it to himself, just to see if it really worked. Spoiler: it did.

He ended up sharing the details on his profile \[splanket\], not to promote anything, but simply because he thought it might help someone else out. No paid courses, no entry fees — just a straightforward breakdown of what he's been doing.

I’ll admit I was skeptical at first, but I gave it a try. Now I'm making around $200–$250 a day, and it doesn’t take much time at all. Honestly, I didn’t believe it at first either.

He’s not asking for anything in return, but I’m sure he’d appreciate a small thank-you (like a coffee) if it ends up working for you too.

I figured I’d write this post to help spread the word. Maybe it’ll be useful to someone, especially in times like these.

I had this strange feeling for a decade now that my coffee consumption creates havoc on/in my skin. For example a few years after starting consuming coffee everyday I developed redness all over my face, sometimes it's flaky and itchy and I have very oily face. On a few days in a year that I don't drink any caffeine I noticed that my skin don't get as red as usual and most certainly I'm not having this strange rebound redness. At the beginning when I started drinking coffee I was also very jittery, nervous and anxious but with years this somehow disappeared no matter how much coffee I drank in a day but I also never really feel relaxed. I tried to stop many times but I never could and I want to know if coffee really makes my skin horrible because I'm very conscious about it but for this I need to stop drinking it for a few months and this is where I need your help.

I did gain some back as it was coming from a place of reaching a goal for an event type shit. so I wanna do it again to lose the fat but this time for myself the thing is I got a date in about 15 days (deadline for multiple events) while also going on that plan for conquering self control, so its a mix. discipline and switching my dopamine seeking from food to something that makes me actually happy and not guilty. as i figured most people struggling with weight and overeating have the core problem in their dopamine dysregulation basically natural brain wired instinct of seeking dopamine/ pleasure from food which explains why most are in a bad mental state, aren't picky eaters. I wanna rewire that by fast days. in my fasting days i actually had really good energy my questions are tho: 1 is it actually a good plan? 2 does the milk and sweetener ruin it in aspects of autophagy and stuff, or is it not even required to lose weight? i feel like i wanna relax my gut from working a bit it literally works day and night it's unhealthy right?",1,1752674167.0,Water_Fasting,0,1.0,False

My first rheumy of course started me on methotrexate, I had all the bad side effects, moved on to sulfasalizine, again bad side effects so I started humira. It was a wonder drug for 3 years and then completely failed.  I got put on Xeljanz and had an almost instant response, no side effects and my life back. I had commercial insurance so it was covered then I had a brain bleed and ended up on disability and Medicare.  Because of our income and the denials for coverage Phizer provided it for free until this year.  The new max out of pocket is $2000, no more “donut hole” and now we have a payment plan, cool. But Humana is still denying the Xeljanz and has a whole list of other meds to try all of which have an out of pocket monthly cost of $4950! Yeah I only have to pay the first $2k but seriously? Who has an extra $2k just laying around? And the worst part is if my rheumys office would actually do the paperwork correctly, not prescribe in 90 day increments, list the reactions to the previous medications etc I could get my meds from phizer again.  No matter how many times I explain it to them they don’t get it. And again like I’ve explained to Humana, why would I want to “try” something else when I know what works? I don’t qualify for the Extra Help anymore by $38 a month so even that’s out.  And all of this bs has knocked me into a flare from hell and I’m so seriously depressed I finally made an appointment with a psychiatrist.  No I’m not suicidal but I feel like I just give up.  I guess just sit at home and suffer? Go back to not being able to hold my brush or my coffee cup I guess.  I can’t take prednisone anymore because I still have an aneurysm so that’s out too.  So where do I go from here? I already requested a referral for a new rheumatologist but appointments are so far out I’ll be out of whatever samples I can literally beg for from the current doctor. He acts like he pays for them himself.  What everyone actually needs is the drug companies charge a reasonable price so it’s accessible for everyone and stop this nonsense of copay assistance for commercially insured patients only.

I fell into a bit of a depression and went from the low 200’s up into the 220’s—really had no regard for a diet.  The neighborhood we were in got bad during COVID, causing even more stress—so I sold that home and the we moved; sadly that just encouraged me to excuse more bad habits with eating and drinking.  I got engaged in late 2021 and married in 2022–I hit 255lbs.  

One year after my first wedding anniversary, I just looked at pictures of myself, disgusted.  I  was sick and tired of feeling sick and tired.  I needed a change.  A few YouTubers had talked about Carnivore and I wanted to give it a try; since I’m an aspiring Pitmaster and figured I could handle an all meat diet.  One of the YouTubers I watched had Neuropathy and talked about how much the diet had helped him.  I did my research and started reading up on it, talked to my wife about making the changes.  She had her concerns, but I assured her I would be seeing my doctor and would change things if there were any concerning trends.

I started in July 2023; mostly eating steaks, burgers, chicken, eggs and such.  I  STOPPED drinking sodas (I  was drinking diet soda mind you), energy drinks and drinking alcohol.  I switched to water, carbonated water, unsweetened tea and black coffee.  The first two weeks were BRUTAL.  I dealt with nausea, bathroom issues, feeling weak at times.  I didn’t think I was going to make it past day 14.  I told my wife at Day 11, that if I didn’t feel any better by Day 14, I’d switch to Keto.  But day 12 came…and I woke up feeling like a million bucks.  I started walking 30 mins every day.  By September I was back down to 210lbs.  I had my first checkups with my doctor—who neglected to tell me I was PRE-DIABETIC prior…. I got my heart checked out, as well as my liver.  I had a series of tests done on my liver, but everything was looking good.

I kept up with it.  I  got myself back in the gym and started light lifting 3x a week and increased my cardio—doing 3.5 mile walks in my community or an hour in the gym.  On my 39th birthday in February, I decided to have a celebratory drink; but found that I couldn’t process it anymore…I  was okay with this.  By April the following year, I was down in the 190’s.  I went from light lifting to more moderate lifting.  By July of 2024, I had noticeable muscle back on my frame.

At the end of 2024, I did hit a bit of a speed bump; we had a friend stay with us, then the Holidays hit, work got a bit stressful—I missed about a month of working out and my wife got sick so I wasn’t as strict on the diet.  That said, I didn’t stop walking or doing cardio a minimum of 5x a week.  After New Years I got serious again; went back on strict Carnivore, increasing the amount I ate, increasing the intensity of my workouts.  Despite gaining mass, I’m now 170lbs.  I’m also in the best shape of my life…at 40. 

I don’t feel my age…at all.  My joints don’t hurt or creak like some of my friends, my grays went away and my hair is fuller than it’s been.  I rarely ever feel tired and I haven’t really been sick since starting this diet.  I’m sure cutting processed foods and alcohol, as well as getting proper vitamins is a huge factor—but I’m VERY happy with where I’m at.  Additionally, if I can do this at my age, ANYONE can.

1m1d6ny,https://i.redd.it/lx5sp1ppr8df1.jpeg,Cystic chin acne practically disappears after replacing almond milk,"Hi everyone, just hoping to maybe help someone who was dealing with the exact same issue as me! I have been on hormonal birth control since I was a teenager for heavy menses and obviously later, being sexually active. Because of this, I always found it odd that for the last six years or so, I have had persistent outbreaks almost exclusively on my chin. These pimples were persistent and started out as cystic and would eventually come to heads. This did not change with any product including PanOxyl (which DID help out the tinier ones I would get occasionally on my face). I tried eliminating dairy altogether (I only replaced regular milk with almond milk, but would have ice cream and other products), cutting down sugar, and then tried eliminating caffeine for a bit. I noticed a change when I skipped my coffee for a week or so, and wondered, surely it isnt actually the coffee? I have been drinking coffee for way more than six years? I started replacing my almond milk in my coffee and cereal with oat and lactaid, and WOW WHAT A DIFFERENCE MAKER!! It has been about three weeks since Ive replaced almond milk entirely with oat or lactaid in everything I previously used it in, and this^ is how my chin looks currently: a HUGE CHANGE from the red, angry cystic mess that it once was. So, dairy free guys and girlies, if youre struggling with this very specific and annoyingly niche problem, perhaps this can help! Best of luck everybody ❤️",2,1752674021.0,acne,1,1.0,False

1m1d60q,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1m1d60q/how_tracking_my_heart_rate_daily_helped_me_catch/,How tracking my heart rate daily helped me catch an issue my annual checkup missed,"I wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone else here.

Last year, my dad had a mild heart attack at 58. He'd been ""perfectly healthy"" according to his annual checkups. After that scare, our whole family became paranoid about heart health. But here's the thing - getting regular ECGs or wearing a heart monitor 24/7 isn't realistic for most of us.

I started simple: checking my pulse manually every morning. But I kept forgetting, and when I did remember, I wasn't sure if I was counting correctly. My readings were all over the place - 65 one day, 95 the next. Was that normal variation or was I just bad at counting?

Then I discovered you can actually use your phone's camera to measure heart rate (same technology as those finger pulse oximeters at the hospital). I started taking 30-second readings every morning after coffee. The consistency helped me establish my baseline: usually 68-72 bpm at rest.

Here's where it gets interesting: After three months of daily tracking, I noticed my resting heart rate creeping up. From my usual 70 to 75, then 78, then staying around 80-82. I felt fine, but the numbers told a different story.

I also noticed my heart rate variability (HRV) dropping. I learned that HRV is like a health score for your nervous system - higher is generally better. Mine went from 45ms to 32ms over two weeks.

Armed with this data, I went to my doctor. She almost dismissed it until I showed her three months of daily readings. The patterns made her order additional tests. Turns out I had developed subclinical hyperthyroidism - my thyroid was overactive but not enough to show symptoms yet.

Catching it early meant simple medication instead of more serious interventions later. My cardiologist said the consistent daily monitoring was key - a single reading at an annual checkup would've missed it.

What I learned:

* Your ""normal"" is unique to you - you need baseline data
* Trends matter more than individual readings
* Consistency beats accuracy (same time, same conditions daily)
* HRV might be even more important than heart rate
* Don't dismiss gradual changes just because you ""feel fine""

I now take 30 seconds every morning for a reading. It's become as routine as brushing my teeth. My resting heart rate is back to 68-70, and my HRV is climbing back up.

For anyone wanting to start monitoring, you don't need expensive equipment. I use an app called BPCare AI (it's on iPhone, not sure about Android). But honestly, even manually checking your pulse daily is better than nothing. The key is consistency and watching for trends.

Has anyone else caught health issues through routine monitoring? I'm curious if others have similar experiences.

Stay heart-healthy, everyone. ❤️",3,1752673976.0,askCardiology,0,1.0,False
1m1d5qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1m1d5qi/i_got_an_espresso_machine_and_now_all_other/,I got an espresso machine and now all other coffee tastes bad,"I got an espresso machine from my aunt for my birthday about a year ago. Nothing too extravagant or fancy, but still worth several hundreds of dollars. It makes truly amazing coffee and there's also a steamer attached to it for lattes and cappuccinos.

Since I had a good coffee machine, I also started investing in good coffee and it's changed my life. I literally moan when I take my first sip in the morning (real coffee lovers get it) and I look forward to my morning coffee the next day before going to bed.

This is all fine and dandy but since I got that espresso machine, every time I get coffee anywhere that isn't some high end café or at home, I'm super disappointed. I know I sound like a huge coffee snob right now but all coffee literally tastes like warm water to me now. I'm a huge coffee lover so it makes me a bit saad that I can't enjoy it as much anymore.

I'm sitting at work right now, sipping on a cup of nespresso that tastes like someone mixed instant coffee with tap water. A year ago I would've thought nespresso was a fancy treat. Now I'm left forever chasing the caffeine high of the mighty espresso machine. :(",1,1752673956.0,CasualConversation,2,0.67,False

1m1d5a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TvGinnyandGeorgia/comments/1m1d5a2/unpacking_sophies_feelings_for_max/,Unpacking Sophie’s feelings for Max,"I believe Sophie still had feelings for Max post their breakup because instead of blocking Max’s number and social media which doesn’t take very long to do, Sophie confronts Max in-person at the kissing booth telling her to stop liking her instagram posts and texting her in season 2. If Sophie was truly over Max and ready to move on, then she would have blocked Max immediately. Max said “I love you” to Sophie when they were dating for a week or two. Sophie hesitating to hug Max back after the “I love you” shows she’s questioning her feelings for Max because Sophie didn’t reciprocate or know if she loved Max back at the time. Two weeks isn’t enough to know you’re in love with someone. You need time to be in love. Sophie thought it was safer to end the relationship now rather than wait it out because she would’ve hurt Max even more if she stayed in the relationship longer only to eventually realize she didn’t love Max back. As it turned out, Sophie was wrong about her feelings, and after some space from Max, she came to realize she does love Max. Sophie’s actions backfired on her because Max developed an interest in Silver by the time Sophie realized she loved Max. The timing of Sophie’s realization most likely aligned with the opening of the musical Wellington. Despite being in past theatre productions and having theatre friends at Wellsbury High School, Sophie didn’t attend the musical Sing Sing in season 1 because she was trying to avoid seeing and/or interacting with Max, but attended the musical Wellington in season 2 because she was ready to face and/or interact with Max, and thus asked Max out for coffee saying “I feel like we have some unresolved stuff to talk about.” Sophie even did the musical Mousse in season 3 to get closer to Max again. 

When breaking up with Max, Sophie reveals that “a lot of the time I feel like a loner, or like my friends don’t really know me or, I don’t know, maybe I just don’t know how to be myself around them, but with you, it’s like taking a vacation from all of that.” which suggests she feels disconnected from the people in her life and can’t be her true self around anyone except for Max, and that scares her because she’s never experienced this strong of a connection with anyone in her past relationships, platonically and romantically. 

Josh was Sophie’s rebound and she only dated him to distract herself from Max’s physical (Max’s interactions with her via text and social media, seeing and/or running into Max at school) and emotional (the deep emotional connection she feels with Max) presence in her life. Sophie confirms this saying “it was just really hard for me to see you and talk to you. It was just easier not to.” after Max mentions Sophie had previously communicated that she didn’t want to get back together with Max during their last interaction at the kissing booth when Max was continually pursuing Sophie post their breakup. 

Even as Sophie tries to get back together with Max, she’s still trying to figure out what’s best for her. Throughout the coffee scene, Sophie acts in the moment and is reconsidering her choices and how to move forward. Sophie is in an emotional situation that she doesn’t want to lean into, but her feelings for Max are so strong and their connection is inevitable that she’s constantly going back and forth (pushing Max away and pulling Max in) because this pull to this person is so strong. This push and pull dynamic is mutual as we see Max pushing Sophie away and pulling Sophie in throughout season 3. But it’s human to at any moment be like “yes. No. Yes. No.” because sometimes you don’t know what the right or wrong thing to do is, so Sophie is just trying to follow how she feels and is not trying to purposely hurt Max. Both keep finding their way back to each other even though they set boundaries with each other, which shows how hard it is to stick to boundaries.

Post their breakup in seasons 1-2, Sophie pushed Max away because that’s what she thought was best for Max even if it’s not what her heart wants. In Season 3, however, despite the mutual pushing and pulling, there’s friendship and care between Sophie and Max in the way Sophie lifts Max up, asks how she’s doing and if she wants to talk about it, and checks in on her even though she can’t romantically be with Max right now.

By that time, it was late in the night. I was exhausted. The sizzling buzz of the ER parking lot lights were an eerie reminder that we were far from anywhere comfortable. I didn’t have the energy to drive home, so I told my wife to drop me by my mom’s house. I could stay there for the weekend and she could go home to make sure the dogs were taken care of. Despite her plea to stay and comfort me during that hard time, I assured her that I would be alright.

My mom lived in a quiet neighborhood. The kind that is surrounded by white fences and full of old retirees. Besides, I had a spare key for the place and I was likely going to need to spend the money we would use to board the dogs for the weekend to repair any damage caused by police officers or firefighters breaking into the house for the welfare call. In the end, my wife conceded to my request and drove me to the house.

After arriving, we exchanged a long hug and a few kisses. I pushed the key into the lock of my mother’s front door. It clicked over smoothly. Turning around, I waved goodbye and watched my car’s red tail lights disappear around the neighborhood corner. I shut the door behind me and turned the deadbolt. No damage here. They must’ve come in through the back door.

Yawning, I walked through the large living room toward the back of the house. Lamps that were left on, likely because they hadn’t ever been shut off, cast light on the high vaulted ceilings. I remember thinking how uncomfortably cold I was, which was unusual for the central US in May. I walked past an old Native American painting. It was an art piece of a tanned figure standing in the middle of a field of lavender blue with white wisp-like clothing draped around her in a flat artistic style. She stared back at me with a blank face. I never really liked that painting and the others like it. Not because they were creepy or distasteful, but because they just really weren’t my style. The frame was crooked, so I adjusted it until I felt like it was as straight as it could be without a bubble level and continued on to the back door.

For what it was worth, the police officers tried their best to minimize the cracks in the siding of the back door. By the looks of the paneling, someone had slipped a crowbar into the wooden frame. It must’ve eventually cracked and given way just enough for them to force the door open. I sighed and gave the deadbolt a twist. There was another satisfying click even though the bolt dragged the entire way through. “At least you didn’t lock yourself up too tight.” I said aloud. I was thankful that the paramedics were able to get in.

I turned to head into my mother’s room through the kitchen. Out of curiosity and some loud prodding from my stomach, I stopped to open up the fridge. The cold, dull light illuminated the contents of the chilled portal. My mom lived alone, so I wasn’t surprised to see a few boxes of leftover takeout in the fridge. My eyes stopped on a box of boneless wings in a bright yellow and brown box. Honey barbecue was my guess and I was right.

The receipt sticker on the top of the lid said they had been picked up four days prior. Dinner was served. “Lucky me.” I sighed sarcastically. I didn’t feel like there was much to be thankful for at the time. Popping the cardboard box into the microwave, I shut the front and let the beep of the buttons take me into a brain haze. The loud whirring noise hit my ears and I stared at the warm orange light through the protective mesh of the window. My eyes drooped lazily. I watched the box go around and around again.

After a moment, my vision shifted showing my reflection. God. I looked like I hadn’t gotten any sleep in days. I guess stress really did wear me down. Motion flickered to my right in the reflection. I didn’t turn at first thinking it was just the dots of the metal grating playing a trick on me. Then, it happened again. This time, it looked like a figure standing right behind me. Cold air curled across my shoulder like that feeling you get when you think you are being watched. I whirled around in a panic only to see there was nothing there.

My hand dragged across my face pulling my eyelids down with my fingertips. I took a deep breath in then heard a loud DING! Right behind me. “Shit!” I made another about-face and slammed my hip against the granite countertop. The microwave. Of course. All I could do was shake my head at my reactions and grab the electric-charged chicken wings.

In traditional modern appliance fashion, the surface of the wings had reached the temperature of the sun, so I went around the corner to check on my mom’s room while they cooled on the counter. She always loved large wooden furniture; the gaudy kind that she paid too much for and that was always too big for the room it was in. There were a few picture frames on her dresser. Reaching out, I grabbed one and tilted it up to get a better view. The dim lamp in the corner of the room showed me a picture of one of her five dead husbands. This was the newest one. Bob was his name. I hardly even knew him and they were only together for a few months before he passed due to an illness.

I was starting to think my mom was some kind of secret black widow who married men for their money and their life insurance policies. I inhaled deeply through my nostrils only to choke up a cough. That was right. One of the paramedics did say she had been on the floor for more than a day. Stepping around the bed, I could see the dark stain on the ground that stank of urine.

She must’ve pulled the blankets down with her, because they sat askew off the bed. Did she have her stroke in bed and fall out trying to get help? My thoughts darkened at the notion. It was too soon to think about all of that.

On my way out of the room, I spotted a small ornate black box on her bed. My mother always liked to go antiquing, but I had never seen this particular box before. I picked it up and turned it end over end in my hands. The wood was a deep ebony with soft waves carved into the sides. To me, it looked like the ocean at midnight. Each corner was adorned with a brass bracket to help reinforce the joints.

Holding the lid shut on the front was a latch of the same bright metal. Looped through a pin, a lock hung open. My curiosity got the better of me as I pulled the lock from its pin. Pushing up the latch, I opened the box. What I saw inside brought a gut-wrenching curl to my stomach, but it shouldn’t have. It was empty. Blank white inner walls loomed back at me. I slammed the box shut and just like that, the feeling was gone.

Box still in hand, I made my way to the couch in the living room with my honey barbecue wings along for the ride. I sat both boxes down on the coffee table and flipped on the TV. Some old black and white monster movie was playing and I felt a smile hit my lips. My mom loved old monster movies. I remember staying up late just her and I watching Dracula or Frankenstein. We’d curl up in her bed with a bowl of popcorn and she’d tickle me when it got to the scary parts. Needless to say, this creature comfort had me slipping off to sleep after the third boneless wing.

My dreams that night were filled with a spattering of what-ifs. I saw my mom, splayed out on the floor. She looked back at me, the cry for help clear on her face. I tried to reach out, but a large spindly hand grabbed my shoulder and pulled me back out of the room. My heels dug into the carpet beneath me, but it was no use.

That bone white hand pulled me back with a strength I was no match for. I heard my mom gurgle out a scream as the door slammed in front of me. “No!” I shouted. “Let me go!” Only to be met with silence and dread. I was continually pulled down a long hallway through another door. Just like the first, it was slammed in my face with a bang.

A second hand came from behind. Long spider-like fingers curled around my face. They dug into my skin, ripping my head back. I forced myself forward only to slip to my stomach. “Let…me… GO!” I grunted out while pawing at the floor beneath me. Two more hands gripped my ankles and yanked me back like I was a sheet of paper being effortlessly torn from a book. I saw door after door whiz passed my eyes. Another. Slam. Another. Slam. Another. SLAM.

They came faster and faster until I could no longer keep track of how many I fell through. Falling? I was falling. I could no longer tell what was up or down. I tumbled through doorway after doorway, occasionally slamming my side into a frame. One door I flew past caught my elbow on the knob which forced me into a death spiral. “Stop it! Make it sto-“

My words were cut short with a wet splat. Ears ringing, I opened my eyes. The room was blinding and lacked any details. Above me, I saw a doorway. I couldn’t move. My body was broken and bleeding. Another unnatural hand reached around the edge of the doorway above me and grasped the knob. Salty tears rolled down my cheeks knowing I had no other option but to watch in dread. I saw the face of the door rush towards me. The gap grew smaller.

SLAM! I sat up on the couch shivering in a clammy sweat. The TV host of the late-night monster show was rambling on about how the creature from the Black Lagoon was simply a misunderstood sweetheart. I looked behind me at the guest side of the house. A door to one of the guest bedrooms was opened and I could see out the window. It was still dark outside.

To calm my frazzled nerves, I flipped off the TV and swung my feet over the edge of the couch. I needed to check the rest of the house. When I stood, I felt my foot press into something soft and damp. It gave way to my weight and I rolled my eyes. My first thought was that I knocked the rest of the wings off the coffee table in my tossing dream state. “Can’t catch a break, can you?” The annoyance in my voice was so thick you could stir it like honey. That annoyance faded fast when I spotted the leftovers still on the table. “Wait, what?”

My eyesight traveled to the floor where the black box laid toppled over not far from my feet. I bent down to pick it up. There was a dark substance that looked to have spilled from the box. Pinching it, I rubbed it between my fingers. “Dirt..?” I examined the inside of the box. It was the same bright white, but at the corners I could see a sprinkling of soil. That didn’t make any sense at all. It was empty.

Another slam wrecked my train of thought and my head shot up to the guest bedroom. The door was no longer open. I stood in that living room for what seemed like hours, dead silent. All I could hear was the clock ticking on the wall and my heart beating in my throat.

The gold handle to the guest bedroom creaked then slowly began to turn. “If there is someone in here, I have a gun. I haven’t had a good day and I will not hesitate to empty this thing into you if you don’t say something right now.” I didn’t have a gun, but that’s all I could think to say at that moment. The handle continued to turn ever so slowly until the mechanism inside gave way. “I’m warning you!” I yelled at the door, but my eyes searched for anything that could help.

I held the box out in my hand like I was holding a pistol towards the door. The door began to creep open at a sluggish pace like something out of a horror movie. The hinges groaned and creaked loudly in protest. “Screw this.” I darted for the hallway and through the dining room towards the garage where I knew my mom hung her keys. “Please, please, please…” I begged. “Please be there.” The keys hung right where they normally did.

Snatching them off the hook, I bolted for the garage door. One of the chairs in the dining room toppled over right as I got into the garage. I smacked the door opener. I was not going to test my luck with whoever was in that house.

I hit the side of the garage with my mom’s SUV door, jumped in, and threw the black box into the passenger seat. Pulling into reverse, my head craned over my shoulder so I could follow the short twist in the driveway. I remember rain pelting the windshield. Through the droplets, my headlights lit up a lanky pale figure. I didn’t care to stick around long enough to see if they had a weapon.

I floored it down the road, not looking back. It was hard to see through the rain, so I slowed down a little and reached for my phone to call my wife. The rain was really picking up which made it hard to hear my wife's voice over the drumming of water on the roof.

“Hello? Are you ok? It’s four o’clock in the morning, sweetheart.”

“Listen to me.” I stammered. “Someone was in mom’s house. I don’t know who they were, but I woke up to them slamming one of the doors. I wasn’t staying around to find out what they wanted. I’m in my mom’s car and I’m heading to the police station now down Willow Road.”

“Oh my gosh! I’m so glad you’re okay. Please drive safe, baby.”

“Me too.” I managed to gasp. A prickle of pain ran up my side and down my elbow. Looking over, I was greeted by a large purple bruise. It looked fresh. “How the hell did that get there?”

“What? What’s happening?”

I shook my head. “Nothing, sorry. Call the police and tell them to head to the house. I’ll drive to the station, but I need to focus on the road.” The wipers on my mom’s vehicle were working overtime. Each second, they splashed across the windshield with a rhythmic thud-thud, thud-thud, thud-thud. “I’ll let you know when I get there.”

“Of course! I’ll do that right now. I love you.”

Before I could get those precious words out of my mouth in response, something big dashed across the street. I dropped my phone into the floorboard and swerved the wheel to the left, barely missing whatever it was. Over correcting, the SUV splashed back to the right catching water under its front wheels. I began hydroplaning at around fifty miles per hour. I did my best to remain calm with a loose grip on the steering wheel and tapped the brake pedal, but I was already completely sideways.

I felt the rims of the SUV hit the grass and gravity leave my seat as I pitched over. Blurry street lights mixed with tossed earth through the cracked windshield. They quickly rolled out of view. A splash of cold water hit my face. I was launched out of the driver side window and into the ditch.

I coughed up murky water and flailed for purchase on something. My feet weren’t touching the bottom. The rain waters were sweeping me down the ditch towards a barred drain at the end. My back connected with the bars. Thud.

I did my best to right myself, but I was having a difficult time feeling my limbs due to the crash. I could see the wheels of my mother’s SUV turned towards the sky, steam emanating from the vehicle’s undercarriage. Managing to turn myself around, I grabbed hold of the bars, but couldn’t push myself past the rushing flood current. Cold iron pressed against my face.

After some time, I was able to see into the large drainage tunnel. The rain had let up enough that the morning sun was peeking over the horizon. Light reflected off the water and up into the tunnel in eerie hues of orange. A familiar item floated past me. I followed it with my eyes, head cocked over to one side in exhaustion against the bars holding me back from getting swept away. It was the black box.

It floated a little way down the tunnel then stopped. Was it caught on something? Long white fingers emerged from beneath the brown water surface and wrapped themselves around the box. My blood ran cold as the rain that hit my neck. I watched the box rise out of the water.

A humanoid figure, pale as snow, rose from the water clutching the object. It hunched over the box. I couldn’t make out any features on its face, but its skin stretched taught over spinal ridges and gnarly joints. It was unnatural, whatever it was. It turned to look at me.

With a curious canter, its featureless face wandered back and forth like it was sniffing the air in search of something. It stopped after taking a few steps closer to me. My eyes widened. With a slow, gruesome rip, its skin tore where a mouth should have been. Rows and rows of serrated teeth smiled back at me behind tattered lips. The edges of this thing’s mouth kept widening until I could no longer see the corners. My vision went blurry and the last thing I remember of that crash was the figure taking another step towards me, jaw unhinged.",1,1752673818.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Ik I could I have went simple but why not make it somewhat fun),"

**Mary Sue (full panic mode):**

> “Wait, WHAT?! Radish is shutting down?! Like... for real? On **December 31, 2025**?! You mean I’ve been crying over plot twists all these years just to *lose the whole platform*?! 😭”
>
> ([Publishing Perspectives][1])

> “I’m not really into all that LitRPG number-crunchy stuff.”

**Me (grinning):**

> “Totally fair! But Royal Road has some top-tier LitRPG—and so much more. Here’s a taste:

## 🎙️ Mary Sue’s Mini Q\&A (featuring attitude, ambition, and strong coffee)

**Mary Sue:**

> “Alright. I’m not moving to a whole new site without knowing what I’m doing. So…”

### 1. “What if my kind of story doesn’t pop off?”

**Me:**

> Not every book hits big. But niche stories thrive with quality and consistency. People still show up—just sometimes more slowly.

### 2. “What if nobody comments?”

**Me:**

> Engagement often happens off-platform—in **Discord**, **Reddit**, or the **Royal Road forums**. Even if your chapters are quiet, readers might be chatting elsewhere.
> ([Royal Road][2], [Royal Road][3])

### 3. “Can I link my Patreon/PayPal if I’m small-time?”

**Me:**

> Yes! Even one supporter can make a difference. Royal Road lets you add links in your profile and chapter notes. Just be upfront—and **always double-check your info** before sharing stats.

### 4. “What about weird, gothic, romantic, or dark stuff?”

**Me:**

> That’s totally welcome! With genre filters and tags (and stories like *Dollhouse Widow*, *Soft Gods*), your vibe will find its readers.

### 5. “Can I run polls—like ‘should Mary Sue kiss the villain or throw him in a mirror?’”

**Me:**

> Totally. Polls in chapter notes get people talking. Off-site channels like Discord amplify that even more.

### 6. “If I flop, can I redo stuff?”

**Me:**

> Absolutely. You can relaunch, retag, tweak chapters—Royal Road is forgiving. Growth is about learning.

---

**Mary Sue (smiling):**

> “…Okay. I’m still kinda heartbroken about Radish. But knowing I have somewhere to land helps.”

**Me:**

> “Same here. Nothing replaces those memories—but having options is powerful. Whether as a reader *or* writer, we deserve choice.”

**Mary Sue:**

> “Alright, I’m checking it out. But if it’s all menus and mana bars, I’m sending you a strongly-worded magical letter.”

**Me:**

> “Deal 😎. Just remember—**check the forums, check your vibe, and don’t count yourself out.** You might find your next favorite chapter there.”

---

### 📌 TL;DR for Fellow Radish Redditors:

* Radish closes Dec 31, 2025 ([Good e-Reader][4], [Publishing Perspectives][1])
* Royal Road has LitRPG and *so much more*—quiet fantasy, horror, romance, gothic, etc.
* Engagement often happens off-platform—in Discord, Reddit, forums ([Royal Road][2])
* Linking your Patreon/PayPal is allowed—even with a small audience
* Polls, community chats, and relaunching all work—don’t be afraid to test!
* **Mary Sue will hold me accountable** if it’s all mana bars and ghost towns 😂

There’s this really friendly coworker, let’s call her Sarah, who always comes over to chat, smiles at me a lot, compliments my shirts. Honestly made work feel less lonely.

Last week she asked if I wanted to grab coffee after work. My dumb brain instantly thought: Oh wow… she’s into me.

So we meet up, and I decide to just… go for it. Midway through our latte I say something like, “You know, I’m really glad you asked me out. I’ve been wanting to get to know you better too.”

She freezes and just… laughs nervously.

Then she goes, “Oh! Um. I just wanted to talk because I thought you seemed lonely at work, and I know how tough it is starting here.”

I wanted to crawl into the floor.

**EXT. SMALL APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING (6:30 PM)**

*MAX is buttoning up her flannel shirt as she steps outside, the wind teasing her loose strands of hair. She's dressed casually in jeans and her favorite worn sneakers, but there's an understated elegance to her as always.*

*She pauses at the top of the steps, glancing toward the street.*

**SFX: A distant HONK**

*Max turns toward the sound. Her eyes widen slightly, her lips curling into an involuntary smile.*

*A stylish car, a forest green Subaru BRZ, purrs gently at the curb. CHLOE leans out the driver-side window, a mischievous grin stretched across her face. Her hair is tied back, aviators perched on her nose.*

**CHLOE** Get in, loser. We're going sunset-chasin'.

**MUSIC CUE:** [Black Lagoon](https://song.link/i/1676315378) by ***Still Corners*** begins playing.

*MAX laughs under her breath and jogs toward the car, still fiddling with her buttons. She climbs in and closes the door, giving Chloe a sideways glance.*

**MAX** You rented this?

**CHLOE** (shrugs) Figured I'd surprise you. Figured you deserve be taken for a ride.

**MAX** (flashing a smile) I'm hoping you mean that in the romantic way.

**CHLOE** (smirking) That depends on your definition of romance.

*Chloe shifts into gear, and the car's engine purrs, lunging forward down the quiet street.*

**EXT. SCENIC OVERLOOK - SUNSET**

*The BRZ pulls into a gravel turnout overlooking a wide expanse of forested hills and golden-orange sky. The sun is beginning its descent, casting the world in amber light.*

*CHLOE pops the trunk and retrieves a small cooler.*

*She walks over to where MAX is already leaning against the hood, soaking in the view.*

*CHLOE cracks the cooler open and pulls out two frosty Coronas, lime wedges already tucked into the bottles.*

**CHLOE** Tell me this doesn’t beat therapy.

**MAX** (grinning as she takes one) That depends. Do you charge hourly or just in beer?

*They clink bottles and sip in unison.*

*A moment of silence as they watch the sun descend behind the hills.*

**MAX** (softly) Thanks for doing this.

**CHLOE** You kidding? I needed this as much as you.

**MAX** Yeah, but you didn’t even tell me where you were going earlier. You had me worried.

*CHLOE looks down at her beer, swirling it thoughtfully.*

**CHLOE** Had to make sure everything was perfect. No distractions. Just... us.

*MAX's expression softens. She leans her head against Chloe's shoulder.*

**MAX** You’re the distraction, Price.

*CHLOE grins, the kind of grin that says she’s exactly where she wants to be.*

**CHLOE** Damn right I am.

*They sit in comfortable silence, the music blending with the breeze. The light shifts slowly, gold turning to rose.*

*MAX leans forward and lightly taps her bottle against Chloe's.*

**MAX** To less nightmares.

**CHLOE** Amen to that.

*They drink. The sky burns orange as the sun kisses the edge of the horizon.*

**EXT. BAR PARKING LOT - NIGHT**

*The sun has long since dipped below the horizon. Neon bar signs flicker overhead, casting reds and blues across the gravel lot. MAX and CHLOE are walking out of the bar, Max stumbling a bit.*

**CHLOE**  
(grinning) Now let's go have some real fun.

**INT. DIVE BAR**

*A low-lit, semi-grimy place with vintage arcade machines lining the walls, pool tables in the back, and a well-worn bar. It’s got charm, but also smells faintly of spilled beer and regret.*

*MAX and CHLOE laugh and dance lazily to a retro song playing on the jukebox. They kiss occasionally between drinks, their connection unmistakable.*

*The bar is dimly lit with a mix of college students and working-class locals. Music plays at a reasonable volume. Max and Chloe have been here for a few hours, clearly enjoying themselves.*

*The camera shows them at different points - playing pool, laughing at the bar, Chloe teaching Max to play darts. The mood is light and fun.*

*Hours pass. The crowd thickens. CHLOE is caught in a long conversation with someone near the pool table.*

*MAX wanders to the bar alone. Her posture is loose, her words a little too loud.*

*A GUY (30s, semi-sleazy, red flannel, buzzcut) approaches.*

**GUY**  
Hey there. How are you doing tonight?

**MAX**  
I'm pretty good, thanks for asking?

*The guy grins in a way that sends off red flags. He leans in closer.*

*CHLOE spots them from across the room and immediately beelines over.*

**CHLOE**  
Hey! She's with me, dickface. Back off.

**GUY**  
Relax, we were just talking.

**MAX**  
(slurring) Yeah, Chloe. Just talking. Why you have to be such a killjoy?

**CHLOE**  
(concerned) How many of these did you have?

**MAX**  
I... dunno, one or two... or maybe 12. Definitely somewhere in between.

*CHLOE grabs her gently by the arm.*

**CHLOE**  
Come on, let's go get some fresh air, okay?

*She leads MAX toward the exit without waiting for an answer.*

**EXT. BAR PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS**

*The night air hits MAX like a wave. She sways as they are walking towards the parking lot.*

*Suddenly, the GUY from earlier reappears, swaggering drunkenly behind them.*

**GUY**  
Hey, ladies, how about the three of us have some fun for tonight?

**CHLOE**  
(annoyed) Dude, I told you to fuck off.

**GUY**  
Jesus, relax, chica, why so wound up? I can help you loosen up a bit.

*He reaches out and gropes MAX's ass, grinning smugly.*

*CHLOE freezes, then explodes.*

**CHLOE**  
(enraged) Hey! What the fuck is wrong with you?!

*She shoves the GUY hard, sending him stumbling back.*

**GUY**  
Damn, girl, so you gonna be like that, huh?

**CHLOE**  
Gonna be like what, motherfucker?

*She lunges. CHLOE tackles him to the ground with the fury of someone who’s been holding in years of rage. She lands on top of him and begins pounding his face with brutal fists.*

**CHLOE**  
(snarling) You don't fucking touch her! You hear me?!

*The GUY yells, trying to protect himself, but CHLOE is relentless.*

*Within moments, two large BOUNCERS arrive. One grabs CHLOE by the arms, dragging her off. The other kneels beside the groaning, bloodied GUY.*

**CHLOE**  
(struggling) I'm gonna fucking kill you, motherfucker!

**GUY**  
(coughing, bloodied) Crazy bitch! I'm gonna sue you so fast...

**CHLOE**  
How about I sue you back for groping my girlfriend, asshole!

*The bouncer restraining CHLOE tightens his grip.*

**CHLOE**  
(to the bouncer) Maybe you should hang a sign outside your watering hole: ""NO DICKHEADS.""

*She glares down at the guy. Then hears the unmistakable sound of retching.*

*Turning, CHLOE sees MAX, doubled over by the bushes, vomiting.*

**CHLOE**  
Jesus, Max...

*Instantly forgetting the fight, she rushes over to MAX, holding her hair back and steadying her.*

**CHLOE**  
(after a moment) Come on. Let's get outta here.

**BOUNCER #1**  
(approaching) You two need to leave. Now.

**CHLOE**  
(bitter) Gladly.

*With that, CHLOE gently helps MAX to the car and into the passenger seat.*

**INT. RENTAL CAR - MOMENTS LATER**

*MAX slumps in the passenger seat, face pale, window down.*

*CHLOE, hands still trembling with residual adrenaline, and bloodied knuckles, starts the car.*

*They drive off into the night, the bar and its ugliness disappearing in the rear-view mirror.*

\*After they arrive home, Max is clearly passed out, and Chloe carries Max upstairs and sets her in bed, on her side, with a pillow behind her back, cracks the bedroom window open, and closes the door, while she goes into the kitchen to smoke. She sits on a chair, with one arm resting on the counter, the other hand occupied with a lit cigarette between her fingers, blowing smoke out the open window, occasionally flicking her cig into a large plastic ashtray, *OREGON* all in faded white capitals being written on its side.

*She keeps thinking about what happened. Max doesn't get wasted. Ever. It was pretty clear that she just drove her girl to drinking. Max is finally beginning to crack at the seams, holding everything together these past 6 months, after the whole ordeal with Arcadia, even. She keeps thinking what a lousy partner she has been, how Max had to keep everything together for both of them, and then having a monster fight the night before, with that vile comment about having to catch up with Rachel. She feels terrible, and decides in her head that she's gonna pick up her game. It's her turn to take care of Max now.*

**CHLOE (V.O.)**  
Deal, Chloe...? Fuck yes!

**INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING**

Max wakes up, hungover as hell, and stumbles into the kitchen. She spots Chloe beginning to cook something for breakfast.

**CHLOE**  
Morning sunshine (kisses Max's forehead).

**MAX**  
(groaning) I feel like hammered shit... (yawning)

**CHLOE**  
Yeah, you totally drank everyone under the table last night.

**MAX**  
(incredulous) I did? Christ... That must have been a funny scene.

**CHLOE**  
(whispered, almost to herself) Yeah, freaking hilarious.

*Max clearly doesn't remember jack shit of what that happened last night, and Chloe doesn't make an effort to remind her.*

**MAX**  
(sitting down at the table) So, this is how it feels like to be hungover?

**CHLOE**  
(smiling) Welcome to the club, noob.

**MAX**  
(smiling) So, what was it that I needed to drink? Pickled cabbage juice something was it?

**CHLOE**  
You're so cute. You just need to drink lots of water. ***And*** have an awesome girlfriend bringing you breakfast in bed.

**MAX**  
(closing her eyes and resting her head against the wall behind her chair)  
Well, we've got water, at least.

*Max begins laughing at her own joke, pretty loudly.*

*Chloe wants to laugh along, but only manages a smile, knowing that on some level Max's right. She* ***is*** *lacking an awesome girlfriend at the moment. But she doesn't let the thought linger.*

*Max opens her eyes, and sees Chloe's wounded right hand knuckles.*

**MAX** (concerned) Hey, what happened to your hand?

**CHLOE** (covering her hand) Oh, it's nothing.

**MAX** (rushing over) No, let me see that!

**CHLOE** (grabbing Max's head) Hey! Don't worry about it, okay? Just go back to bed.

*Max clearly reluctant, drops it, however and does go back to bed.*

**INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER**

*Chloe carries the tray carefully into the room, nudging the door open with her knee. The morning light cuts through the half-drawn curtains in a soft, almost forgiving glow. Max is sitting up against the headboard, a pillow behind her back, a blanket draped over her lap. Her eyes are still glassy with sleep and hangover, but they brighten the moment she sees Chloe.*

**CHLOE** (smiling gently) Room service.

*She sets the tray down across Max’s lap. It’s loaded with care: a neatly folded omelet, crispy bacon, two golden waffles dusted with powdered sugar and a drizzle of maple syrup, a peeled orange sliced into perfect segments, a steaming mug of coffee, and a tall glass of ice water with a lemon wedge on the rim. Chloe even added a tiny glass jar of honey and a cloth napkin.*

**MAX**  
(eyes wide, voice cracking with delight)  
Holy crap, Chloe... This is like... *brunch brunch.* Where the hell did you learn to do this?

*Chloe leans against the wall, letting her shoulder and head press into the plaster, her left foot resting flat on the wall behind her. She watches Max with a small smile.*

*Inside, Chloe's heart tightens as Max coos over every little thing on the tray like it’s a treasure chest. First the waffles, then the orange slices, then the fact that the water even has a lemon. She's counting the little joys like a kid on Christmas morning. Chloe swallows hard, blinking a few times.*

*This was probably the third time she'd ever cooked breakfast for Max. And she couldn’t even remember the other two clearly. But she* ***does*** *remember the countless mornings when Max got up early, hair messy, socks mismatched, humming some dumb indie tune as she brewed coffee or scrambled eggs. She remembers barely saying thanks some days, just stuffing food into her face like it was owed to her. She remembers being too hung up in her own shit to realize someone was holding everything together so it didn’t fall apart.*

*And now Max, hungover, exhausted, still somehow beautiful in that Max way, is grinning at her like Chloe just gave her the world. That look pierces right through her.*

*Chloe’s throat tightens. A lump forms, and she tries to cough it away.*

**CHLOE** (clearing her throat) Max!

**MAX** (looks up mid-bite) What?

**CHLOE** (deflective) It’s not a big deal. It’s just breakfast. Okay?

*She tries to chuckle, but her voice wavers just enough to give her away. Max doesn’t press, just gives her a sleepy smile and returns to the food.*

**MAX** (resuming her smile) Well, then, I'd better get to work.

**CHLOE** (nods) Just… eat up, buttercup.

*She turns and heads for the kitchen, her eyes stinging. She tells herself it’s just the cigarette smoke from earlier still messing with her, but she knows better. She puts her hand over her mouth as she exits the room, needing a second. She’d made up her mind last night. And now, watching Max smile like that, Chloe knows, this is just the beginning. Her turn. Her time. No more letting Max carry the weight alone.*

1m1czf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/newhampshire/comments/1m1czf7/visiting_this_weekend_have_we_chosen_well/,Visiting this weekend. Have we chosen well?,"Hey everyone, 
 
My girlfriend and I (29/31) will be visiting from Missouri (we have an Air BnB near Bartlett/Conway) for the first time this weekend! I'm very excited because this will be the first new state checked off my list in years (#43!). Our time in NH is somewhat brief. We arrive late Friday night and can have a pretty leisurely departure on Sunday morning as we head for Portland, ME. We have a rental car.
 
I would love if we could get some recommendations on the following in our area (and hopefully you will appreciate that I am not coming in blind and have done at least some research):
1. Coffee Shops (Maybe White Mountain Ski Co? Saw that on an old reddit thread looking around for which recommendations were nearby, but maybe there are other places closer and better that I missed because I am not as familiar with NH geography.)
2. Hikes : I have read that Mt Washington via the Lions Head trail is beautiful, but I am a bit intimidated by it. While we both love to hike (and have experience from hiking in Colorado, New Mexico, British Columbia amongst others), it looks like that route in particular has some pretty vertical scrambles that make me a bit uneasy. Getting injured on day 1 of a 9 day trip would be very sad for both of us.... We really don't mind a challenge, but maybe something ""lower stakes"" if there are other beautiful and scenic options nearby? Or am I worrying about nothing? Even if I am worrying about nothing, any other great hikes you enjoy?
3. Breweries : In addition to hiking this is basically top of the list for us. Hate to be cliche, but IPAs and Sours are our favorites. Tuckerman is a name I've seen around quite a bit. Good choice?
4. While we really only have a day and a half in your beautiful state, is there anything we would be stupid to miss? I'm sure this won't be our only time visiting as we go to (working class) Cape Cod every year to visit her family.

Thank you in advance for any recommendations you might have. Really appreciate your time :)",4,1752673510.0,newhampshire,14,0.83,False

Usually I don't ask a lot for help, but this is quite driving me crazy, so I came here :P  
So, I run Arch linux on my MacBook Pro T2 and, since it's a T2, I have this kernel: \`6.14.6-arch1-Watanare-T2-1-t2\` and I followed [this guide](https://wiki.t2linux.org/distributions/arch/installation/) for the installation process. So, I wanted to do a GPU passthrough and found out I gotta do a single GPU passthrough because my iGPU isn't wired to the display, for some reason. I followed [these steps](https://gitlab.com/risingprismtv/single-gpu-passthrough/-/wikis/home) after trying to come up with my own solution, as I pretty much always do, but neither of these things worked. And the guide I linked is obviously more advanced than what I tried to do, which was to create a script that unbinds amdgpu to bind vfio-pci. Now, after the steps on the guide, I started the VM and got a black screen. My dGPU is a Radeon Pro Vega 20, if it helps.

Are we really flexing about **automatic doors** and **RFID cards** as if they’re cutting-edge? What’s next — bragging about having *working elevators*? Every uni has those. Some even have *soap* in the bathroom.

For instance:

* Bring in that **Boston Dynamics robotic dog** — friendly version, of course — casually roaming the campus, wagging its tail, keeping an eye on things with built-in surveillance so no one tries to ride it.
* **Dynamic Smart Screens** — showing real-time info like:
* Class schedules, Empty study spaces, Room availability, Food court wait times, Weather and train delays
* **Indoor navigation system** — AR-based or app-linked — to guide students to lecture halls, especially those cursed ones hidden in Building 11.
* **Charging benches** with solar panels and wireless charging pads.
* **Smart toilets** that automatically report maintenance issues (*“Toilet 3 in level 2 crying for help since 9am.”*)
* **Interactive lab tables** with touchscreens for circuit simulations, or live feedback during experiments.
* **AI-driven waste bins** that sort rubbish automatically and report fill levels to cleaners.
* **Bicycle pods or e-scooter docks** with real-time availability tracking.
* **Climate-controlled outdoor study pods** that adjust ventilation and lighting based on weather.
* **Self-balancing delivery robots** — to bring coffee, printing material, or even someone’s forgotten laptop across buildings.
* **ADD other points in the comments.**

We’re supposed to be U\*\*""T""\*\*S. Meanwhile, **Unis without ‘Technology’ in their name are doing more**. USYD, UNSW, MQ, UOW — they don’t even claim to be about tech and they’re pulling ahead.

Let’s stop being the **University of Token Systems** — and start being the **University of Tomorrow Sydney**. Show the world what “Technology” really means.",8,1752673127.0,UTS,9,0.9,False

**1 Corinthians 8:13**

* *So if what I eat causes another believer to sin, I will never eat meat again as long as I live—for I don’t want to cause another believer to stumble.*

It’s not enough to know that something isn’t wrong, that we have the right to do certain things.

If we were the only people in the world, with no one else to consider, it would be easy to decide what we can and can’t do. But other people are always around, and we have to think of them when making decisions.

A person might have the right to play loud music in their house every night until midnight. It’s their house, and they can do what they want. But if there’s a sick neighbor who’s disturbed by the noise, what should they do?

That’s when love steps in and tells them to give up their “right” and sacrifice their enjoyment for the sake of someone else. Love is demanding. It asks us to give up our rights, our pride, and our comfort—nothing can stand in its way.",1,1752672982.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False

1m1cpqn,https://i.redd.it/5bu4a2zrn8df1.jpeg,I am beyond livid with NCL right now.,"It’s 4:45 am on the Bliss. I’m sitting in the Atrium that is FINALLY QUIET. Why am I in the Atrium before 5 am, you ask? It’s probably way more reasons than I’ll remember to list. I’m going to try.  

First: Norwegian charged me $3000 for an upgrade to an aft facing penthouse with large balcony. The app never updated from my original stateroom number. I spent countless hours calling NCL and Expedia (and yes, I’m fully aware you don’t book cruises through Expedia, now). No one would talk to me about this, they were convinced I was attempting to scam them in some way. I articulated very clearly that I wasn’t worried about the money and I fully understood that AmEx would clear it up. 

Finally, 11:30 PM, the night before sailing, I was able to convince someone to speak with me about how I didn’t even know what stateroom number to put on my bags. I was informed that my upgrade had been taken back with no warning or information. 

If I hadn’t pushed and pushed to get someone to listen to me, our embarkation would have been a nightmare. 

Upon arrival on board, I was appalled by the number of people crowding the ship everywhere. I know staterooms become available later in the day, but it was absolute chaos—not just the elevators that we expect on embarkation—but, the atrium was standing room only, the observation deck was loud and incredibly unpleasant. All of the seating surfaces seemed to be intentionally uncomfortable to discourage people from relaxing ON VACATION.

I had pre-booked the Thermal Spa for myself, my sister had said she didn’t want it, and it was my understanding that my 17 year old wouldn’t be able to use it. For the first two days, I was only able to find peace and quiet in there. Eventually I spoke with the staff about overriding my daughter’s age… she turns 18 in a month… and they told me she could come in as long as I’m in there. So, I paid an additional $700 for my sister and my daughter to have any kind of relaxation on board this boat. 

I got a $350 hot stone massage… during which the masseuse told me I’m fat (I am 48 yrs old, I’m well aware) and should get fat reducing services, my skin is horribly dry; I need hundreds of dollars in products, and should stop taking medications prescribed by my doctor and get acupuncture. I’m severely bruised after the massage to the point of not being able to sit with my back against any chair. I regularly get massages, and have NEVER been bruised like this. 

Our stateroom said it had a sofa bed. This translates to a sofa with blankets in it—like you’re staying over at someone’s house because you drank too much. My sister is sleeping in a sofa for about $3000 for her very first vacation ever.  This is wrong in so many ways. 

The food options are horrendous.. unless you pay for upgraded meals. We have had Le Bistro, Teppanyaki, and Cagney’s. All three have been exemplary. Starbucks is great—because we paid the upgrade and the staff remembers our drinks because we are friendly and kind. 

The main dining rooms serve cold food. We have never gotten hot food. The wait staff is run absolutely ragged and don’t have time to make personal connections. 

The buffet, with the exception of the Indian food, is not far from nursing home food. Red and yellow jell-o, oddly named desserts that I cant begin to guess what they actually are, and a salad bar that consists of cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, huge chunks of bell pepper, and coarsely chopped red onions. I want to make myself a charcuterie plate to take back to my room. There were two kinds of meats folded in half and thrown on a plate, and two kinds of cheeses cut into adult finger sized sticks thrown on a plate. Not a nut, jam, or cracker to be found. 

The Local—which is supposed to always be open—just informed me they could give me coffee or a cold cucumber sandwich. I couldn’t get a soda because the bar isn’t open. 

The beds in our room are so hard—hence the 3 am wake up that resulted in me speaking with the CS person at 4 am. 

The wine prices in the dining rooms are not what are on the NCL website. I’ve never liked wine and wanted to use the beverage package to try new wines. I ordered a class of wine that the sommelier suggested would be less dry and a bit more sweet—there was a $2 up charge. I looked up the wine and it’s $14 a bottle at BevMo. 

When I went to speak with customer service this morning, her only explanation was Covid. No, just no. This isn’t about Covid. This is about corporate greed. NCL is misrepresenting what they’re selling. 

At this point, with everything I’ve had to add to make trip trip remotely comfortable, I’ve spent well over $11,000 for three people to be in one balcony stateroom. If I want to keep having edible food for dinner, I’ll be spending another $200 a night. 




If you want to be cheeky or rude in your responses—note that I will know you and I live vastly different lives and will categorize my response as such. I also hate capitalism, but am fortunate enough to have traveled the world a good deal and have standards—that Norwegian used to meet.

And yk, if they do it once, they’ll do it again. 

I went on leave and despite written instructions, my sick and vacation time was never used. I have expressed that this has put my housing at risk, and applied to the cup fund, but that got denied and obviously my manager doesn’t give a fuck. I want/need out of this place, as not only is it a terrible work environment, but I’m scared of lowkey getting attacked physically now lol. I really don’t want to be told to go to management, bc I have been in a similar situation, and nothing was done. 

I’m thinking I talk to my boss tomorrow and ask very sweetly and politely to cash in my vacation and sick time since I meant to on leave, and the next day, quit immediately. I’m trying to teach next month, I’m fairly confident it’ll work out, and if not, I’ve got my savings back now that I’ve been back to work for a few months. 

Point is, if I have enough sick time, I may be okay to leave, and I need out.

I asked to learn how to invoke properly since my current invocation practice felt inadequate and had, ""randomised efficacy"" to say the least. Meditated. Went to sleep. 

Woke up. My phone was dead. Used my mom's phone to scroll through YouTube with my morning coffee. Mom's phone is an important detail since I don't use that device and definitely don't do my research there. Randomly pops up a video of Lon Milo DuQuette talking about his standard operating procedure. Checked it out. Read his materials. Liked the guy. I'm like 50 years younger than him but some of his recounts from his life are eerily similar to mine. 

Previously in another session King Paimon had told me and I quote, ""Kneel before me again and I'll rip the ground from under you."" 

So hey. King Paimon directed me towards a solomonic invocation. Guess who's going to do it now? ",2,1752672544.0,DemonolatryPractices,0,1.0,False

1m1cl0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthNLifeTipsHub/comments/1m1cl0a/dizzy_spells_fatigue_and_a_diagnosis_hiding_in/,Dizzy spells. Fatigue. And a diagnosis hiding in plain sight.,"Ramesh (44) had been running on empty for months.  
Tired after basic chores, unfocused at work, and constantly thirsty — he blamed it on long hours and skipped meals. Coffee and energy drinks became his daily fuel, and headaches were just part of the routine.  
  
Then one morning, while walking to the kitchen, he suddenly felt the room spin. His vision blurred, his legs wobbled, and within minutes, he blacked out.  
  
That fall led him to [Dr. Satish Gupta](https://g.co/kgs/oN1pPAG), considered the best General Physician in Pune and a top Diabetologist in Pune at AIMS Hospital.  
Dr. Gupta approached things differently — he didn’t just treat the symptom. He asked about Ramesh’s sleep, hydration, diet, and mental stress. A few blood tests later, the cause became clear: undiagnosed Type 2 Diabetes with dangerously high sugar levels.  
  
Instead of overwhelming him with numbers and restrictions, Dr. Gupta created a plan Ramesh could stick to — structured meals, basic walking, and low-dose medication. Within weeks, the dizziness faded. The constant thirst disappeared. His energy returned — and so did his focus.  
  
Why this story matters  
Because so many people normalize fatigue, brain fog, and burnout — without realizing their body might be waving red flags. Ramesh didn’t just need medicine; he needed someone to look beneath the surface.  
  
If you or someone you know has been “pushing through” strange symptoms, maybe it’s time to pause and dig deeper. Sometimes, all it takes is one right checkup — before it turns into something serious.",3,1752672452.0,HealthNLifeTipsHub,2,1.0,False

1m1ckre,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m1ckre/aita_for_leaving_after_my_husband_put_an/,AITA for leaving after my husband put an application in for me at his mother's work?,"If you dont like LONG drama filled stories, dont read. I have been with my husband for 9 years and we have a 1yo daughter. I took maternity leave around 37 weeks pregnant, had her at 41 weeks and I have been home ever since. This was mine and my husband's plan. I would stay home until she's 3 and in preschool. Plenty of money saved (money is no issue). We spent years saving and preparing for this. 

My MIL (his mom) started getting super weird when she found out I was pregnant. She used to come over for coffee dates with me twice a week and just talk and that ended abruptly when I became pregnant and turned in to her trying to get my husband out of the house and away from me. Showing up 100% at random and telling him ""I will let you treat me to lunch"" and then tell me I wasn't invited because it was a ""mom and son date"". Started buying him expensive jewelry (he hates jewelry and has never worn any of it). Showed up at random times with her half eaten sandwiches/soup/pasta and giving it to my husband because ""I was just thinking of you hunny"". Never brought food for me. In fact, there were several times she would show up after I made dinner and stuff her face with it to a point where there was none left for me to eat. Yes, my husband always put her in her place. Multiple times he blew a gasket at her. No, that did not stop her. And this still continued well after I had the baby. She would come to the house, high pitch scream mock the baby whenever she cried. The one time she did hold my daughter, she instantly stuck her in her swing and stood between me and the baby so I couldnt grab her. She was kicked out for that and we went no contact for awhile. Yes, I feel this is all relevant. Because around this time is when she also tried convincing my husband to quit his job and go work with her because she missed him and ""needed him"". He was making $38 as a boat mechanic and she wanted him to go work as a ""life coach"" in a medical unit for $17. When he said no because he couldn't take that pay cut, she got angry and told him that if I was working than it wouldn't be an issue and that I need to get a job. He told her we had a plan and that pissed her off even more because she doesn't like her precious baby boy being a provider because she thinks im using him now. Didn't have issues before pregnancy but now I am the devil apparently. 

Anywho, my husband did start working for another company 5 months ago and now he works 14hr overnight shifts and makes around $60 an hour. His mom came here last week and started planting seeds. Telling my husband he is missing all of his daughters upbringing and that it's all because I dont work. Telling him I am a mooch or a leech or whatever. And yesterday evening I am all the sudden getting phone calls about a job position at my MIL's employer, stating they got my application and want to bring me in for an interview and that MIL told them all about me and how I haven't worked for ""forever"" so they are willing to help me out. I hang up and call my husband and he tells me that he was the one who put in the application and that it ""would be nice"" if I was working too because then he can ""cut back hours and be home more"". So, his mom got in his head because this man would not be home more if I got a job. He is union, first year and has a mandatory set schedule for the next 2 years. 

Now.. I told him at this point that if he's really going to let his mom get in his head instead of actually focusing on facts and logicistics than I can go and he can move mommy in. He continued to defend his mother and say she was right. So, I left. I sent him a text telling him where I would be and told him that he could come and see our daughter absolutely whenever he wants but I am all set. He thinks it's just about a job application and is telling people as much. But here's my real problem.. I have over $400k saved, I have stocks, savings bonds, etc. The baby has a hefty bank account already that I contribute to weekly. Our home is owned outright. AND I still pay bills and have since I went on leave from work. I dont touch 'his' money (seperate bank accounts). I pay the internet, my phone, my insurance, ALL food for the home, and all of our streaming services. I am also the one who handles whatever the baby needs 90% of the time. He pays his phone, his insurance (much heavier than mine because he has 3 vehicles to my 1), his bike note, dinners if we go out and the hot water bill. 

He says im overreacting here. That it's not a big deal that he put an application in for me at his mother's place of employment. To me, it is. The position he put an application in for is transporting teenagers with records from petty theft to violence against other people to and from their behavioral programs. A position that requires a driver, a security officer and 4 monitors due to behavioral issues. All because his mom convinced him I was a leech. I refuse to go back home however. I told him my requirements to going back home would be an absolute no contact with his mom for the near future, which he won't agree to because she has health issues (Lupus). And for those wondering, no, she has zero relationship with our daughter. She wants no relationship with our daughter and every time she is in the presence of our child, she blatantly ignores her or just scream mocks her whenever she cries. Tells people still to this day that she is ""indifferent"" about my husband having a kid (hes the youngest of 4 and no, she does not act like this with her other kids or grandkids). Our daughter hates this woman. And again, NO, this was not a thing until I got pregnant. I used to brag about how great my MIL was. Now the only thing that interests her is sinking her claws in to my husband and he is falling for it. AITA?",1,1752672434.0,AITAH,7,0.67,False

1m1ck2d,https://i.redd.it/dwn3jo8qm8df1.png,From Penny Stock to Powerhouse? WKSP's Quiet Transformation,"Let's talk about WKSP because something doesn't add up here. This company:

* Partners directly with Hyundai on solar tech
* Just posted their best quarter EVER
* Is expanding R&D to double down on clean energy

Yet somehow it's still trading like some random penny stock while competitors with half the growth trade at 2-3x sales multiples. Makes you wonder - when exactly does the market wake up and smell the coffee?

Here's what I'm seeing:  
✅ Real OEM partnerships (not just press release fluff)  
✅ Actual revenue growth (not just hype)  
✅ Smart expansion into bigger markets

The ""penny stock"" label is looking more outdated by the day. All it takes is one more contract win or partnership announcement for that narrative to flip hard.

So here's the real question - do you want to be early to this rerating party, or late to the ""why didn't I buy when..."" regret club? I know which side I'd rather be on.

Anyone else been tracking this disconnect between WKSP's fundamentals and its valuation? The gap seems too wide to last.

Round two of Query, along with first 300 words. This is a Beauty and the Beast reimagining. Thanks in advance!

— Query —

Dear [Agent’s Name],
AN INCONVENIENT FAIRYTALE is a standalone romantic fantasy (84,000 words) that blends the cozy charm of THE HOUSE IN THE CERULEAN SEA with the mythic intrigue of NETTLE AND BONE. Told in dual POV, it’s perfect for fans of character-driven fantasy, beastly folklore, and slow-burn romance. 

Bellamy Beaumont prefers fantasy novels to real-life drama—especially the kind stirred by Gabrielle Laitier, the local golden girl who just declared him her festival date. But after a strange encounter with a wild-looking woman in the garden behind his café, Bellamy begins to suspect something magical is stirring. And for once, he might be ready to stop being a footnote and start writing the story for himself.

Lady Evette D’Louvre has lived 449 years cursed as a Beast after murdering her unfaithful husband and his lover. Her fate is tied to enchanted hellebore flowers—each one a fading reminder of her failure to love without control. With eight days left, she’s resigned to restore her crumbling mansion as a final act of grace. But when she meets Bellamy—and learns his mother has created life through alchemy—Evette dares to hope: maybe they can revive a dying spell. Or at least buy her time.

Evette hires the Beaumonts to help restore her estate and investigate the curse. Together, they begin to unravel the magic that binds her. What starts as sarcasm and shared renovations deepens into fragile intimacy. Bellamy sees the woman behind the monster. And Evette—fanged, volatile, and starved for light—fights to believe she’s not too far gone to be loved. 

There’s no salvation through heroics or true love’s kiss—only the slow, quiet care built between dustpans and shared breakfasts. If Bellamy’s books have taught him anything, it’s that believing someone is worth saving might be the strongest magic of all. Every small act becomes a rebellion against the curse’s grip. Each moment she rejects intimacy, the final transformation draws closer.

Can quiet love break a curse born of blood and betrayal—or will it fail to reach the monstrous heart within? With the Beast as a sharp-edged woman and Beauty as a stubborn-hearted love, this gender-flipped retelling offers a tender, character-driven twist on a beloved tale.

— First 300 —

Funny, how you reach for peace, and the universe immediately decides you’ve had enough of that.

I had barely cracked open my book behind the counter—just one quiet page—when the front bell practically shrieked. I startled, fumbling to shove the novel under the till as Gabrielle Laitier descended. A queen summoned by ancient rite and caffeine. Bright orange hair blazed in the morning light; her strut could conquer kings. Good thing I was not nobility. Just a bookshop barista in his twenties, armed with a fantasy novel for a shield, a marker for a sword.

Behind her, a small entourage of vibrant women cackled through any sense of peace. Gabrielle leaned against the counter, a cloud of citrus perfume preceding her. “Bonjour, Bellamy,” she drawled with a crooked grin.

I gulped. “Um… Bonjour. Having your usual?” I grabbed a paper cup and began scribbling. “Medium iced, caramel syrup, whipped cream, and mocha drizzle?”

She lifted her chin. “You know me so well.”

“It’s—it’s the same order since middle school… so…”

Before I could finish, the girls erupted into a cacophony of squawked orders. I fumbled for more cups, scribbling their demands, the ink smudging as my grip tightened. The espresso hissed, the frother whined, and the air filled with the heady scent of coffee. 

One of them giggled as I nearly splashed hot mocha on her perfectly coordinated beige outfit… and onto myself. I pushed through, my focus narrowed, until, finally, a tray of custom-made coffees stood before them, a testament to my caffeine-fueled endurance.

“You feeling alright?” another asked. I nodded, heat creeping up my neck as I set the tray before them and wiped sweat off my brow.

Gabrielle took a slow, deliberate sip. “You’ve got a date to the festival tonight or what?”

""Um… no… I was…""

""Perfect. You'll be mine then.""

Hey everyone!

I’ve been dealing with a pretty bad LPR flare-up for the past month. My throat has been completely red and inflamed, and my primary care doctor even said it looked “burnt.” I initially started on 20 mg of omeprazole but bumped it up to 40 mg/day on my own before she officially increased me to 80 mg/day (40 mg twice daily). 

I mentioned the gastric issues to my psychiatrist, and both he and my primary care provider advised me to stay on my meds if they’re helping overall. But honestly, the medications are the only major change I’ve made recently, and they seem like the most intense trigger. The only other thing that’s ever pushed me to this point in the past was heavy binge drinking, which I no longer do. 

I have a history of alcoholic gastritis, but I rarely drink now. Back then, sucralfate, 40 mg omeprazole in the morning, and sobriety helped me stabilize. Right now, I’m taking 10 mg of Trintellix for depression and anxiety (used to take it at night, now I take it in the morning with food), and 10–20 mg of Adderall IR as needed for ADHD. I take all my meds with food and avoid GERD trigger foods entirely (coffee, citrus, spicy foods, chocolate, tomatoes, etc.). I don’t lie down for at least 3 hours after meals. I also sleep on a wedge pillow and recently added Reflux Gourmet after meals and before bed. 

Since adding Reflux Gourmet, I’ve noticed a little less burning in my throat but more nausea and discomfort in my stomach. I’ve also started taking 5 mg of melatonin in the evening after reading it may help counteract how antidepressants can weaken the LES. The flare-up became noticeable not long after I began Celexa, which I stopped after a short trial and switched to Trintellix. I’d been taking the adderall for about a month by then. Even after significant dietary changes, it feels like almost anything can still cause a reaction; I had crackers and ginger tea the other day and still felt worse afterward. The mornings are always the worst, with a strong acid or bile taste in my mouth when I wake up.

I’m trying to stay patient, but I’m also working and need to manage my symptoms. I’m wondering if it might help to take a break from Adderall for a week or two and try something gentler, like Everyday Dose mushroom coffee. I know it’s not a perfect replacement, but I thought it might be easier on my gut and help me function without worsening the LPR. I do have a gastro appointment coming up, but while I wait, I’d really appreciate any advice or experiences, especially from people who’ve gone through something similar. I know Reddit won’t cure me, but honestly, I trust the lived experience here just as much as the clinical side.

TL;DR:

LPR symptoms for a month. Currently on 80 mg omeprazole, Trintellix, and Adderall. Started melatonin and Reflux Gourmet. Throat pain improving, but now dealing with stomach nausea. Avoiding all trigger foods. Considering taking a break from Adderall and subbing in mushroom coffee. Looking for input or similar experiences while I wait to see GI.",1,1752671656.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

OA!,"TL;DR: Hindi maintindihan ni boyfriend na need ko ng space. Hindi nya maintindihan na masakit masyado yung mga ginawa nya sa akin. Kaya, ayun! Sinabayan nya yung tampo ko kesa mag effort o bigyan ako ng peace of mind habang nag hi-heal sa disappointments na sya rin mismo ang may gawa.

CONTEXT: ""Hindi ko gets kung bat ikaw pa yung mas galit... OA!"" Ito yung mga katagang gusto kong sabihin sa boyfriend ko kaninang madaling araw after kong mabasa yung ""Ah sige ganyan pala gusto mo"" after kong humingi ng space ar tulugan sya since nag ""Go"" na sya noong una sa hiling ko.

Last Saturday, nag date kami. Iyon kasi yung gusto nya kaya pumayag ako since kinabukasan yung monthsary namin. Papunta ako sa meeting place namin nag heads up na agad ako na masama ang pakiramdam ko. Nagkaroon na agad kami ng argument dahil hindi NA NAMAN nya naintindihan yung pinag-usapan namin sa tawag (meeting place at kung saan kakain).

On time akong nakarating. Samantalang sya hindi pa nakakaalis ng bahay nila. I decided na bumili ng monthsary gift para sa kanya. Dumating sya na dala yung laptop dahil hindi pa raw sya tapos mag work. Aware naman ako na dadalhin nya yung laptop pero ang sinabi nya kasi is mag a-out sya kaya nya dadalhin. I remember humingi pa nga ako ng pasensya at sinabi kong sana di na lang ako pumayag kasi baka naabala ko pa sya.

Sa loob ng dalawang oras, nakaupo lang kami sa coffee shop. I even asked him na maglalakad muna ako sa labas dahil inaantok talaga ako dahil hindi ako sanay umupo ng 1 hour straight at wala rin kasi akong ginagawa. Ayaw nya at nagbanta na kapag lumabas daw ako is lalayasan nya ako. So, tuloy lang yung conversation. Out of nowhere, tumahimik na sya tapos hindi na sya sumasagot sa akin. After 20 minutes doon lang sya nag salita na gumaganti raw sya dahil hindi daw ako sumasagot sa kanya. Hindi ko alam na hindi na ako nag re-respond sa kanya. Nag respond ako na hindi ako aware kasi nga BAKA MASAMA ANG PAKIRAMDAM KO.

Ilang minuto lang nag patay na sya ng laptop, nag book ng MoveIt, at binabalik sa akin yung regalo na binigay ko. Nag explain ulit ako na baka hindi ko namalayan kasi masama yung pakiramdam ko. Pero hindi talaga sya nakinig. Kaya ang ginawa ko, ako na yung umalis. Nag try pa akong mag stay around the area pero nag send sya ng link ng MoveIt location nya at sinabihan nya ako na iniwan daw nya sa staff ng SB yung monthsary gift ko sa kanya. Balikan ko raw doon para kunin. I decided na umuwi na lang from Makati to Bulacan kasi wala na talaga ako sa mood. Kinagabihan, nag apologize naman sya.

I asked for some space dahil ilang days na namin tina-try maging okay pero hindi talaga okay sa end ko. Nag ""go"" naman sya. Afterwards nag reply pa sya sa IG story ko at nakausap ko pa. Nakatulog ako then paggising ko, bumungad na sa akin yung mga salitang:

""Good night""
""Ah ganon walang pansinan ah""

Nag reply naman ako na humingi nga ako ng space, 'di ba? Bakit sya pa yung galit? Sinabi ko rin na hindi ko alam kung anong kailangan ko except sa tampo nya. Dahil I have all the right para mag tampo. Tama naman, 'di ba? Pero wala syang reply at alam kong muted ako dyan.

Kung tutuusin, wala akong napala sa araw na 'yon. Hindi naman na ako nag expect ng gift. Pero ang sakit lang isipin na pinilit kong makita sya kahit hindi ako okay. Sinagot ko yung Starbucks (at hindi ko isusumbat yan sa kanya) dahil mahal ko sya, at higit sa lahat nag effort din ako na bigyan sya ng letter at regalo. Wala man akong natanggap na materyal na bagay o fair share sa pagkain, sana man lang inunawa na lang nya ako.

Tapos ngayon ako yung nape-pressure. Kahit galit ako, kailangan kong ibaba yung sarili ko. Kailangan kong suyuin para maging okay kami. Pinipigilan ko lang na ako na yung mag step-up. Kahit na ang hirap.

A little bit of background is I (27f) live with my boyfriend (27M) and my daughter (4) on my mom’s property. My boyfriend works full time, 40 hours a week, and I stay at home with my daughter. 

I’ve always wanted to be a stay at home mom, I always wanted to be a mom, but ever since I had my child it’s been really hard. My boyfriend is the only one working and we don’t have any support or help despite living with my mom. So for the past four years it’s been just my boyfriend and me raising our daughter and it’s been so fucking stressful. 

It’s been so stressful that I realized I’m not enjoying or living life anymore, like I’m barely present with my daughter. It’s like I don’t know how to be a person and am just trying to survive the day most times and my daughter gets the brunt of that, bc she wants to play and have fun but I’m burnt out and have no energy. 

This is the life I’ve always wanted and everyday the overwhelming guilt of not enjoying it and not being present in it guts me and kills me. I stay in distractions (like being on my phone all the time which is boring and sucks) , don’t do anything nice for myself, let alone take care of myself, don’t know how to keep my daughter entertained most days, don’t know how to love my significant other or how to stop fighting with him. 

Sometimes I wish I could stand still time, and just walk around a bit, catch my breath, before jumping back in, but I can’t. The closet I get is getting up an hour before my daughter, exhausted from a night of no sleep, make a coffee, and let her sleep in until 9. ",1,1752671309.0,Vent,4,1.0,False

1m1c4je,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m1c4je/the_life_factory_part_22/,The Life Factory (Part 2/2),"That embrace never came, and the magic teleportation he hoped for was nowhere to be seen. Dreading to stay in the campsite any longer than he needed to, William struggled to his feet, nursed his back and began to head back to the road. He was about to continue his pilgrimage onwards. He didn’t have a desired destination in mind, but his heart was telling him to head towards The Life Factory. The one odd structure that seemed to loom over the whole town. Its purpose unknown, but it seemed like the only place that might conceivably have someone there. Maybe it was a source of industry? Maybe it still was? Life was in the name, so hopefully, he’d find a sign of life within. He set off in the loose direction of the factory and hoped he wouldn’t get lost in the fog. The factory was to the north, and that’s where he needed to go. He went to use the compass on his phone and suppressed a cry of anguish when he found it out of battery. Not to mention, the screen had been smashed in. He didn’t think he’d had an impact hard enough to break his phone, but maybe it was from one of the many falls or perhaps the collision with the door beforehand. With nothing to lose and nothing to guide him, he pressed onwards.

The infinite fog continued to billow around him, occasionally unveiling more decrepit shop fronts and broken homes. The constant sounds of cracking wood, trampled slate, and the eerie howling of wind amongst the fractured buildings around him continued to set his skin on edge, any sound sending shivers down his spine, and every touch of the breeze leaving strip after strip of goosebumps across his flesh. William was feeling weary from the day’s at least he assumed it was day, terror, and was in need of food, water and a place to rest for a bit. The tents and cabins of the mysterious campsite had been a bust, and he hadn’t had the heart to investigate the rusting warehouses around the grounds. They’d all seemed horrifically uninviting at best and on the brink of collapse at worst. He didn’t want to risk getting buried under oxidised sheet metal, so he’d given them a miss. Chances are, they’d have only contained slate anyway.

Following the one road that had attached to the campground and trying to follow the map, William came to what was supposed to be the massive shopping district that had been built into the town. What he found, though, was that the map had technically lied to him. It wasn’t a shopping district; it was a market square. There were rows and rows of market stalls looming around a cracked concrete foundation littered with cattle grates and broken steps. The wood was speckled with damp and the rotting bodies of insects. Even amongst the bug debris, slate was scattered across the wooden countertops. The signs had faded with the town, and any produce that had been a part of the market was long gone. There were traces of a putrid slime from rotted fruits and vegetables baked into the hardwood stall fronts, but nothing tangible he could eat. It was another bust as he’d thought there’d be shops with potential tins and cans in them. Nope, just more abandoned architecture and empty liminal spaces.

He continued his search for food amongst the stalls, but nothing turned up. He’d approached the final row of stalls when the air became permeated with the sound of cracks and groans. All around him, the stalls began to topple. One by one, wood splintered, and the stalls began to smash into the concrete, sending shards and poles flying. It was like watching dominoes topple as row after row became rubble. Amongst the sounds of snapping wood and crashes of impact, there was an ethereal auditory horror prickling his ears. With each stall that fell, there was a scream. With each fallen row, the screams increased in intensity and were often followed up by moans of pain. Had someone else been exploring the square when he’d arrived? Was he somehow not the only person here? Scanning the area and traversing the sad state of the stalls, there was no one to be found. The moans grew worse as he threw broken poles aside. What was making these sounds? It didn’t bear thinking about. He just picked himself up, checked his palms for splinters and wandered off into the fog.

His prayers were answered soon after the dismal market square. A larger structure took shape on his left. He figured he was close to the end of the shopping district as he’d tried his best to push on North towards The Life Factory that loomed over the town. Investigating the structure, his palms grew sweaty and his heart raced as he saw the dead bulbs of a supermarket sign. A sign of modern civilisation in this abandoned pit town. Wharton Colliery had been alive at some point this century. Surely this place had to have tins right? It would be a haven of canned goods and potentially other supplies like water and medicine. Oddest of all, it was still in one piece. There was a distinct lack of decay compared to the rest of the town. Did this building have a forcefield, or was it just made of sturdier stuff? It seemed to be a much more modern structure when compared to the rest of the town’s buildings. Its windows weren’t smashed and its walls remained free from holes or the overtaking of weeds. Aside from the shattered bulbs in the sign, WHARTON MART had survived the elements. Approaching the doors, he steadied his breath and tested the doors. Hardly surprised to find them unlocked and manoeuvrable. With a deep breath, he pushed open the doors to the abyss, unsure what to expect on the other side.

Somehow, the inside of the supermarket was just as odd as the outside. Much like its outer shell, the inside was almost spotless. The lights that would have lit the aisles were all dead, the only light coming from the limited glimmers shining in through the windows. All the fridges and freezers were dead, with stagnant pools forming around them where ice and groceries had melted in the heat. Nothing perishable remained as the fruit and veg stands were barren, milk had rotted and putrefying meat littered a butcher’s section, the scent making the air within the building nauseating, and the hum of flies accompanied the ambient silence of the space. The same had happened to the fish display, slimy, rotted fish mingled with lukewarm pools of melted ice and the disintegrated remains of older produce. It was another brutal assault on the senses as that nostril-burning scent went to war with the stench of the meat. This place would be unbearable for longer than a short stay.

To his relief, there were tins and bottled water available. The tins were in mostly pristine condition. A few labels had faded, but the tins were free of rust and seemed to be in nominal condition. No dents, bashes or holes were present, and all the lids remained unopened or uncompromised. It was a welcome sign of relief in an ocean of tragedy. He kicked aside another slate stack as he continued across the grimy tiles of the supermarket, looking at his options and hoping to god that there was a can opener in one of these aisles. It was a large enough shop, not some little corner shop, so he was hoping for the best. Thankfully, there was so he dug into a tin of corned beef and a cold tin of spaghetti hoops. It wasn’t a gourmet meal by any stretch, but cold pasta and salty meat felt like heaven as it slid down his throat. So much so, he decided to open another tin as he collapsed against the shelves and helped himself to seconds.

Horror overtook him on the second mouthful of that second tin. The bite seemed fine at first when something started to stick in his windpipe. Something had been embedded in the meat he’d eaten and was now cutting off his airways. He started thumping his chest and clawing his throat, trying to dislodge what had stuck there. A sharp point was digging into the walls of his throat, painfully dragging grooves in the poor flesh. With another pound, he got lucky and the blockage was dislodged, shooting out of his throat and across the floor, pinging off the shelf opposite him before sliding back to the middle ground towards him. It was another piece of fucking slate. A blood-splattered spearhead-shaped lump of the grey stone that had somehow entered an unopened can of meat product. His throat hurt like hell from the ragged lines he’d just made, and the taste of rock and iron flooded his taste buds. He spat out a wad of blood-flecked saliva and continued to eat, wincing as he swallowed and surveilling each bite for any other foreign bodies. At least three other pieces were hiding within the tin, none of them making them making them into his mouth.

After the second tin of salted meat and a dessert of canned peaches, also pitted with slate, he realised he’d not drunk anything since the coffee he’d had in the car before he’d entered the town. He recalled seeing a display for bottled water and began investigating the packs. There were plenty available, and none of them seemed to be tampered with. The packaging remained intact, and the caps remained unmolested. He tore into a pack and grabbed the first bottle. It passed the initial glance, and with a twist of the cap, he brought it thirstily to his lips and took a long, hard pull. The water felt like nectar pouring down his throat, soothing the new grooves he’d made in his oesophagus and relieving some of the exhaustion that had been plaguing him since entering the town. It was the most refreshing bottle of water he’d ever tasted. Before he knew it, it was empty, and he was cracking open a second one. He didn’t even bother looking at this one, he just began to down it. Big mistake. That second blast of water immediately set off warning signs in his brain. There was an underlying grit to this mouthful of water. He spat it across the aisle and found dirt and grit clinging to his tongue. Holding the bottle up in the faint light, he could see an entire level of sediment built up across the bottom of the bottle. The gritty and cloudy water looked like it had been dredged from a mud puddle with a layer of rough stone floating around the surface. He angrily tossed the bottle at the shelves in front of him. The resulting splash zone soaked him with more gritty water, landing all over his shirt and trousers.

He angrily stormed off further into the store. The events of his makeshift meal, compounded by the recurring slate and taunting displays going on in the town, were beginning to take a toll on him. Pawing through displays and pushing abandoned trolleys out of the way, he kicked aside more slate stacks and looked for either towels or replacement clothes. He found neither after traversing every aisle and sulked against a dead freezer. The appliance was unnecessarily hot, and the ground around it was slick, further soaking into his trousers. He banged a fist off the side and jumped out of his skin when something on the other side banged back. He did it again, trying to keep his composure and found he got the exact same response. Maybe it was an echo? He kept banging against the freezer, thudding out familiar tunes and half-baked Morse code, almost entertained to hear whatever was banging back made the exact same responses, following him bang for bang. It was unnerving but oddly reassuring. An echo was now making him feel less alone. He bashed out a few bars from a song he’d heard on the radio and could barely contain his disappointment when he didn’t get a response this time.

Instead, he got another terrifying surprise as he felt a hand grab at his hair. It wasn’t some glancing brush; it was a full-on grasp, pulling at his hair so hard he thought it would rip out. Rough palms were clawing at his scalp and ravaging his hair, pulling it out hair by hair. He tried to pull away but was constantly dragged back by the force within the freezer. It hadn’t been an echo. It had been an entity within that formerly cold space. A foe amongst the formerly frozen goods of the store. It was like being attacked by the mummy within the sarcophagus, but instead it was emanating from a place that would normally be holding frozen pizzas. He’d found himself in a battle he couldn’t seem to win. The thing’s grip couldn’t be shaken as it continued to rip at his hair and angle its lanky arms around towards his throat. It was going to try and choke him out. Scrabbling for a foothold, he found his feet slipping around the floor as he saw that a viscous red liquid was pouring out from a crack in the plastic shell of the freezer. As crimson continued to pour out like something from the elevator in the Shining, he found this thing’s grip floundering. He could finally start to pull himself free as the sound of collapsing stone echoed around the aisle. Unfortunately for him, he wrenched himself at the wrong moment and propelled himself forwards at an uncontrollable speed. The drenched floor made that even worse as he skidded off into the distance and collided hard with the shelving ahead of him. With a loud crash and a showering of cans, William got to look up at the ceiling and cried out in horror as the last thing he saw before a can knocked him into unconsciousness was a pair of light blue eyes staring a hole in his soul from the ceiling. A trickle of blood running into his eyes turning his vision red, then black.

The thing to bring William back to reality was a splitting headache. He cried out in pain as he was dragged kicking and screaming back into the waking world. His head was crying out from the impact to his skull, and he found that the eyes he’d seen just before passing out were gone now. The eerie silence of the supermarket was all he could hear, and the greyish shine of appliances was all he could see. There were no monsters or macabre beings to greet him as he returned to consciousness. It was a boringly mundane return after the horrors that had knocked him out. Keeping his head steady, he began to pull himself up. There was a crust of blood on his temple, probably from the fall and a lump forming in the middle of his forehead. He seemed mostly okay, if a little achy and began to trudge towards the entrance of the supermarket. His leg was itching up a storm, and he wasn’t sure why. He expected it to hurt from where he’d landed, not itch. He dragged his trouser leg up and found his stomach seise up and his heart racing up to his mouth. The skin was grey and cracking. A chasm had formed across his shin, surrounded by crumbling grey and crusted blood. It felt like a canyon was growing in his leg. Worse still, it was slowly leeching its way up the rest of his leg. He could already see tendrils of grey snaking their way up his leg. He scrambled to find some antibiotics and chugged them down with another bottle of cloudy water. With that dealt with to the best of his ability, he tried to ignore the itching and push onwards into the ever-present, ever-welcoming fog.

He pushed on once again, trying to navigate north and find the Life Factory. As the major landmark of the town, it was his best hope for finding anyone. He continued onwards, one foot after the other, ignoring the itching in his leg and throbbing in his head to keep moving on. The antibiotics kicked in eventually and he found that he could move without impediment at last. He kept to a straight line and found that the town was slowly dissolving around him as structures became fewer and fewer. Either the fog was getting thicker, or everything around him had decayed into total ruin. There weren’t even foundations to lock in on or the abandoned housing or shopfronts he’d come to call friends. It was like the further towards the Life Factory he got, the less life the town around him seemed to had. Aside from the road he followed, there were no signs of civilisation at all. Consulting the map, he found he should have been in a residential zone, an area that should have been marred by houses and blocks of flats. Instead, it was a desolate wasteland with nothing to landmark it. Just silence and emptiness.

The only thing that began to shake up the monotony of this continuous trek north was something unexplainable that had began to happen as he drew nearer to where the Life Factory should reside. A loud siren would keep ripping through the air. Every few minutes, his ears would be blasted by a sporadic procession of industrial noise and the howl of machinery. Almost like a factory warning alarm blaring out. William got to the point where he could almost count the seconds between the calls. It became that regular, and every time it came out, it would shake the ground, and somewhere far off, he’d hear the sound of something collapsing. It was almost like each siren was a call from Gabriel’s trumpet heralding in an individual rapture for whatever thing collapsed next. Even the slate was getting less frequent. He couldn’t move for it originally, and now, it was scarce. He still had to kick away oddly ordered stacks of the substance, but that was becoming more of a clockwork chore.

The next siren was the loudest yet. He felt his eardrums straining against the sounds assaulting them. He had to stop and collapsed to the ground, hands covering his ears as he felt his body wracked by painful convulsions. The pain in his leg grew more severe, and his head felt on the verge of exploding. Waves and waves of agony pummelled his body as the sound reverberated off his core, punishing his very essence with painful vibrations. He lay there and sobbed as each second felt like agony. He could almost believe it was the calling of his own rapture as it hurt so much. He curled into the foetal position and continued sobbing, hoping to be given a reprieve from the torment being inflicted on him. Someone must have been listening to him as he was given his wish.

The siren stopped, and William found the world had gotten darker. Looking up, he found himself in the shadow of a monolithic super structure. A spree of buildings that took up everything on the horizon. Even the fog seemed scared of this structure as he could now see everything. As far as the eye could see, there were parts of this factory. A labyrinthine mess of corrugated iron walls, flat roofs and monstrous smoke stacks. Fires blazed in the stacks. Walls were pristine, polished and shiny against the grime of the other world around it, and the range of buildings was staggering. William could see at least three different loading docks with no vehicles making collections, row after row of warehouses and storage facilities and walls stretching as high as the skyline. This one building or collection of buildings dwarfed the town. He’d finally found it. He hadn’t been sure what to expect, but this hadn’t been it. This factory was the size of the whole town he’d traversed and seemed alone in this deserted wasteland. Like it had sucked all the life out of the surrounding landscape. Holes seemed everywhere around the outskirts of the factories as the ground was pockmarked by pitfalls, running deep like abandoned mine shafts into the heart of the Earth. Maybe that’s what it had originally been? An abandoned slate mine that had become something so much more? He had so many questions and didn’t necessarily feel like he’d get many answers standing outside. There was a very obvious entrance into the factory, and with one last gulp of air, he took his tentative first steps into the gloom of the Life Factory.

Light. That was the first thing to take him by surprise upon entering the intimidating structure. The walls were cold concrete littered with industrial signs and some dated health and safety messages. Posters about carrying goods and breaks were still hanging on the walls and indicated that the place had once been used. Clinical bar lights were welded to the ceiling, still burning brightly despite the clear abandonment of the facility. The place still had electricity; he could hear the crackling of currents mixing with the mechanical hum of machinery. Production was still ongoing as conveyor belts were running unattended throughout the place. Portholes gave glimpses into production floors, storehouses and other facilities within the factory itself. Not a soul could be found, but their essence lurked everywhere. It felt like the place was alive with his own footsteps echoing the usual to and fro that would normally go on within the place. Control rooms were covered in cobwebs, dust-covered filing cabinets, and the documents within them had been eaten by time.

The buzz of machinery continued to drive him mad as he hoped to find someone, anyone, in the constant corridors of mechanical tedium. The name Life Factory had led him to believe he was going to find something otherworldly. Something extraterrestrial. Instead, he’d found a glorified Amazon warehouse. An Amazon warehouse where the only product being shipped out was slate. His arch nemesis was back as it again as it was dragged through the factory on miles of conveyor belts. Nothing else and no one else was around. He was alone in a mechanical hell with nothing but stone to keep him company. The existential dread began to creep in as he wondered if he’d ever see life outside of this foggy abandoned town. The people were gone. The life was gone. Only the factory lived on. Churning out slate to a population that didn’t exist. His leg itched again, and as he reached down to scratch it, he recoiled as he found grey stone under his nails, dragged up like dead skin. Pulling back his trouser leg, he found that his whole leg had been overtaken by the grey plague. His hands were going a similar colour, and he could see even more grey snakes of disease coiling themselves around his flesh. Hopefully, this place would have a cure. If not, it was going to be his tomb then.

As he was drawn further into the factory, he found the conditions start to decay along with his condition. The walls were beginning to grow darker, lights grew dimmer and less frequent and huge, flesh-like veins seemed to bulge from the walls. His eyes were drawn to the pulsating tunnels popping out of the walls; chunks of something, probably slate, were being transported along them, almost like they were being digested. Like he was watching intestines from some inhuman being following him through the bowels of the factory. Holes began to appear in the floor as corridors became gangways and the walls began to fall away, leaving him looking out into a void. He was walking along an infinite walkway with nothing but conveyor belts of slate below and bundles of those tubes snaking around the railings he clung to. Even the mechanical sounds fell away to an eerie silence interlaced with the gurgling of digestion and a rough breeze blowing amongst the liminal space he now traversed.

This carried on for quite some time. The scenery didn’t change at all. The sounds didn’t let up, and the breeze continued to buffet him. Shards of stone were blown into his eyes, and the itch had transcended his leg and spread all over. His arms were torturing him, his legs burned, and his scalp wouldn’t stop bothering him. There had been no mirrors or reflective surfaces for him to look into and check his condition. Nor had the light really come back to a reliable level for him to investigate. He was in borderline darkness with nothing but miles and miles of steel walkway, flesh tunnels and rubber conveyor belts to keep him company. He’d raked grooves into his flesh from scratching, yet no blood came out. His skin felt tight and blistered. Hard and crumbly to the touch and raining like dandruff when he moved. He was beginning to lose hope.

The steps continued. Time became meaningless. Hours could have passed. Days could have passed. Instead, it was just an endless slog of seconds and steps, culminating into this long, singular stretch of industrial hell he now inhabited. One foot in front of the other. Absent-mindedly headed towards the end of this tunnel. There was no light, but maybe he’d get some answers. A little closure to the mystery he’d been embroiled into. The railing had grown rusty, and there were holes developing in the walkway around him. The machines seemed to stutter around here as conveyor belts stalled, and the flesh tubes that had been following him grew more and more strained with stone. Jagged tips poked through the lining of the tubes, leaking a viscous brown liquid onto the metal around him. Whatever it was seemed acidic as each drip burned another hole into the metal it touched. The hiss of melting metal with the drip of the oozing substance provided some bleak comfort as it broke the silence. Conditions continued to deteriorate around him. The lights were smashed, the metal creaked under his feet, and the railings started to fall away, giving him nothing to hold onto.

At that moment, his leg shattered. He was dragged to the ground as his leg just ceased to exist. One moment, he’d been walking; the next, his leg shattered into a broken pile of fractured slate. He forlornly looked at the wreckage that was his former limb and continued dragging himself forward. He didn’t feel any pain. There was no blood. It was like removing a prosthetic that could no longer serve its function. He didn’t even feel a phantom pain or longing for it. Almost relieved to have lost the dead weight. He just kept dragging himself forward, using the cross-hatch pattern of the ground as handholds. It was slow going, but he couldn’t stop now. Desperation dragged him on as he wanted answers to the abandoned town. To the monsters he’d seen. To the ever-present slate. He’d given up hope of ever leaving alive. He just wanted to leave enlightened.

His other leg crumbled away soon after. Again, there was no pain. Slate rained through the holes in the ground as his leg collapsed into debris. He was relieved as it made him lighter and meant he could keep dragging himself onwards. He was determined to keep moving, and soon, he was falling. The walkway he’d been used to drag himself onwards ceased to be. It had unceremoniously dropped him down into a void. Like one of those tunnels, he’d seen outside the factory. He was now part of that network. It was like riding a water slide as he slid through the tunnel with nothing but darkness around him. Twists and turns dragged him deeper into the earth, slate reaching out for him and knocking chunks out of his skin. Soon, an arm was gone, splintering on impact with the wall of a tunnel. A few turns later, the other was gone too. He was now just a head, torso and stumps of broken stone. Again, he was shocked at the lack of pain. The lack of any sense of loss. Every removed limb made him feel better. Lighter. He had nothing to fear. His painful journey was coming to an end.

The tunnels spat him out onto a conveyor belt. He was now rolling along a black tunnel with other slate piles keeping him company. As he moved along, he could hear laughter and chatter around him. Sounds of celebration and happiness. He could feel tears of joy welling in his eyes as he found the community he’d been looking for amongst the rock piles following him on this journey along the factory floor. Everyone, including William himself, were eager to make it to their destination. Feeling a paradise just within reach. A cure to whatever ailed them at the end of the belt. Voices chattered about missing loved ones. New jobs to make up for the mine closing. People after a new start since their lives had fallen into despair. Everyone had left their homes to find a new life at the factory. He was amongst residents of the town. He’d been seeing them the whole time. They’d been guiding him here. Pushing him to come to his salvation. Freedom from his job. Freedom from the doldrums of Wharton Colliery. Freedom from the gangrenous limbs he’d developed. It was all at the end of the belt. He didn’t even notice when the piles around him were flattened by the industrial press overhead. There were no screams. No cries. No fear or pain. The press came for him next, and what was left of his fractured form was flattened into a slate pile. He didn’t even feel the pressure as his head was crushed, and the world became black. He just smiled up at the press as it freed him from his broken body.

He’d never expected to come to. He’d found all he’d needed to in the darkened conveyor belt under Wharton Colliery. He’d found a community. Found a cure. Found an escape. So, he was surprised, to say the least, when he awoke again. He felt alien. He couldn’t feel his arms or legs. Couldn’t feel his back, neck or head. He felt incredibly flat. He’d been expanded way beyond human capability. He tried to flex his limbs and found there were none to respond. He couldn’t move his head. He could just stare out into his surroundings. Rolling his eyes from side to side, he found he was in one of the abandoned cabins of the campground he’d visited before. Mould and mildew greeted him, permeating the air with a scent of rot. He was looking down into the room from on high. Bunk beds and scratched desks were all he could see, and the drip-drip-drip-drip of damp was echoing in what he could only assume were his ears. He felt sick. He couldn’t tell if it was the scent or the shock of waking up in this new form, but something was making him nauseous. He couldn’t take it. He needed to empty his guts. Something wormed its way up his oesophagus. Something was forcing its way out, and it wasn’t going quietly. A chunk of slate fell out of his mouth and smashed across a desk below. Tears welled from his eyes as he realised what had happened. He was never going to leave Wharton Colliery. He was going to be a part of it permanently. His tears formed a puddle on a desk below, granting him a minor reflective surface to see what had become of him. Those tears grew worse as staring back up at him were a pair of painted blue eyes.",1,1752671232.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1m1c4da,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m1c4da/might_the_mr_coffee_10_cup_thermal_coffee_maker/,Might the Mr. Coffee 10 Cup Thermal Coffee Maker Redefine Your Morning? Review Inside!,"Exploring the Mr. Coffee 2150023 Stainless Steel 10 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker has been an interesting journey. As someone who values a good coffee machine to power through busy mornings, I gave this product a solid run in my daily routine. With its array of features, sleek build, and technology-rich options, I aimed to uncover both its gems and quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of this thermal coffee maker instantly grabbed my attention. Sporting a stainless steel body, it adds a polished feel to any kitchen counter. Its compact dimensions (10.79""D x 12.36""W x 15.98""H) suit smaller kitchen spaces, though it still felt a bit heavier at 11.1 pounds during unboxing. The buttons are well-placed, giving it a modern touch while remaining user-friendly. The carafe, being double-walled and stainless steel, keeps coffee warm for hours, a real lifesaver for anyone prone to forget their cup on the counter.

**Performance and Brewing Features**  
This machine didn’t let me down in the performance department. The Optimal Brew technology is its standout point, heating water to a perfect 205°F while brewing 20% faster than previous models. I noticed a fuller flavor, which truly made a difference compared to my older coffee maker. Plus, the Strong Brew selector lived up to its promise, delivering a bold and richer cup for those groggy mornings. For added convenience, the programmable Brew Later option was fantastic – waking up to fresh coffee felt like a luxury without the hassle of fumbling early in the morning!

**[Check Mr. Coffee 2150023 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08mx4xg97/)**  

**Ease of Use and Cleaning**  
Ease of use is where this coffee maker shines. The Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause feature was perfect for impatient coffee enthusiasts like myself. Being able to sneak a cup mid-brew without spills was a delight. Furthermore, the freshness timer had me hooked; it’s a simple touch but felt like a game-changer when determining whether the pot had been sitting too long. Cleaning was fairly straightforward thanks to the removable water reservoir, though the carafe itself can require extra attention due to its thermal insulation.

**Advantages**  
- Double-walled thermal carafe maintains coffee temperature for hours.  
- Programmable Brew Later feature adds a layer of convenience.  
- Optimal Brew technology extracts fuller flavor with faster performance.  

**Critiques**  
- The 10-cup thermal carafe feels smaller when hosting guests; an optional larger version would’ve been ideal.  
- At 11.1 pounds, moving or storing it isn’t the easiest task.  
- The machine can produce slight gurgling noises during brewing – not super loud, but noticeable early in the morning.

**User Experience and Target Audience**  
This coffee maker seems tailored to people who value customizable settings, freshly brewed coffee on-demand, and modern convenience in their kitchen appliances. Working professionals, parents with packed schedules, and anyone fond of premium coffee-makers will likely treasure its features. Despite its weight and minor noise levels, the machine complements a ""set-it-and-forget-it"" lifestyle extremely well. Friends who visited during its testing also appreciated the boldness of the coffee, making it a hit all around.

**Competing Brands**  
Versus Breville’s thermal coffee maker, the Mr. Coffee option excels with faster brewing and its freshness monitor, features Breville lacks. On the flip side, Breville feels more robust with its slightly larger carafe. Keurig's single-serve machines, focused on pod coffee, are another rival; however, they lack the programmable nature and stainless steel thermal carafe this offers. For those inclined toward larger kitchen gear, Ninja’s dual-purpose coffee and tea systems might appeal more, albeit at a pricier entry point.

**Value for Money**  
Weighing the features like the freshness timer, Brew Later, Strong Brew selector, and the sturdy thermal carafe, the investment felt justified. Machines offering similar features often exceed this product’s price bracket, making it a reasonable contender in the market. However, smaller downticks like noise or weight might push some buyers toward other options. If thermal design and feature-packed programming matter most, it's hard to go wrong with this purchase.

One night, at 3 AM, we arrived to find the church doors locked. So We decided to grab coffee at the Ministop near Robinson's Mall since it's so early and we feel sleepy. As we reach the Celia Street, a noticeable chill settled over us. The air was heavy. The broken streetlights are so creepy the street is in the total darkness. each step echoing unusually loud in the heavy silence. All l see was my cousin and nothing else My heart pounded like a drum. Then, a unexpected strong scent of sweet, sampaguita filled the air. There were no flowers nearby, only the suffocating darkness. Fear and cold, hit me. My breath stucked in my throat; my mouth went dry. We ran as fast a we could. The bright lights of the Ministop felt like a physical and mental relief, washing over us with warmth and safety. The taste of the coffee I gulped down was extremely bitter, yet suprisengly comforting.

1m1c1bp,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1m1c1bp/why_choose_kitchenaid_kad2rxd1_refrigerator_water/,Why Choose KitchenAid KAD2RXD1 Refrigerator Water Filter Review for Your Home?,"The KitchenAid KAD2RXD1 Refrigerator Water Filter has made an impression in my household for its simplicity and effectiveness. In my daily routine, staying hydrated with clean and refreshing water is non-negotiable. Given that my refrigerator's previous water filter had seen better days, this filter became a timely upgrade. As someone who appreciates quality water filtration, this single-pack filter not only met my expectations but exceeded them in a few areas, while leaving some room for improvement. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact design of this water filter plays well with its efficiency. Measuring 2.5 inches in diameter and 8.69 inches in height, it was easy to install in my refrigerator. The plastic build might not look particularly premium, but it seems sturdy enough for regular replacement cycles. The weight, at just 7.8 ounces, made its installation a breeze. Hailing from Taiwan and manufactured under the Whirlpool name, it carries a reputation of trust in quality. That said, I wish KitchenAid had focused on using slightly more eco-friendly materials. In today’s world, reducing plastic usage isn’t just a trend, it’s a necessity.

**Performance and Filtration Efficiency**  
This filter has achieved NSF certification, which immediately indicates its credibility in reducing harmful contaminants. Over the weeks of use, it filtered out unwanted elements, including lead, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. As someone who obsesses over coffee, I found my morning brew tasted noticeably better. One standout feature is that it's equivalent to replacing 1,500 plastic water bottles, which is not just a statistic but a behavior-altering incentive. Still, I was curious about how consistently this would last without impacting water flow rate.

[Check KitchenAid KAD2RXD1 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0c444ktgd/)

**Upsides**  
- Effective filtration that enhances taste and removes harmful impurities.  
- NSF certification for peace of mind.  
- Easy installation and compatibility with a range of KitchenAid refrigerators.  
- Reduces dependence on single-use plastic bottles.  

**Negatives**  
- Heavy reliance on plastic in its construction is a downside.  
- Like most refrigerator filters, replacing it every 6 months adds up in cost.  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Replacing the old filter with this one was surprisingly hassle-free. KitchenAid has done an excellent job streamlining its compatibility with their refrigerators. All I had to do was check the previous filter model, ensure compatibility, and twist it into place. It didn’t even take five minutes. However, like clockwork, this filter’s performance diminishes every six months. While replacing the filter every half year ensures top-notch quality, it’s a recurring expense that some might hesitate over.

**Who’s It For?**  
Families, coffee enthusiasts, and anyone tired of buying bottled water will appreciate this filter. It delivers on the promise of cold, fresh, and chemical-free hydration directly from your refrigerator. Households with kids especially benefit, as parents won’t have to question what’s going into their children's systems. But if you’re on a tight budget, this product might feel a tad expensive given the frequency of replacement.

**Competing Products**  
When stacked against comparable refrigerator water filters like GE's MWF and LG’s LT700P, this KitchenAid version competes strongly in filtration performance. The certification to reduce 28 contaminants is commendable, surpassing many of its rivals. GE offers some cost advantages, albeit with slightly compromised durability. LG’s filters lean more eco-friendly in materials, but I've noticed they don’t last as long as they claim. The KitchenAid KAD2RXD1 strikes a good middle ground—functionality at its peak while fitting neatly into most refrigerators.

**Price Performance**  
The price tag feels justified primarily due to its filtering prowess and NSF accreditation. KitchenAid pitches it as a high-performing product, which holds true for the most part. My frugal side wishes it were slightly more affordable for regular use, yet when weighed against the benefits—including reducing 1,500 plastic water bottles—it’s hard to argue against its value for money. Investing in convenience often costs a little more, and in this case, it’s worth it.

As someone who enjoys starting mornings with a fresh brew, I couldn’t resist testing this aesthetically pleasing French press. The pink and gold design caught my attention immediately, and I couldn't wait to put it to the test both visually and practically.

**Eye-Catching Design for a Stylish Start**  
This French press is an absolute beauty. The pink and gold color combination, coupled with heart-shaped accents, adds a glamorous touch to the kitchen. The temperature-safe glass is encased in a golden stainless-steel frame, and the stay-cool handle is not only functional but also ergonomic. Whether sitting pretty on the countertop or being used during brunch with friends, it consistently gets compliments. Impressing guests with coffee has never felt so chic.  

[Ready to snag Paris Hilton Paris Hilton French Press? See Amazon’s price.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0b2l1zwjf/)  

**Ease of Use and Brewing Experience**  
Operating this French press is as simple as it gets, making it ideal even for first-time users. The included heart-shaped measuring spoon is not just a fun detail but also incredibly functional for measuring just the right amount of grounds. After brewing, the fine mesh reusable stainless steel filter ensures that no coffee grounds sneak into your cup. Learning how to use it perfectly took no time, and the option to brew loose-leaf tea was a delightful bonus I didn’t anticipate loving so much.

**Positives**  
- Aesthetic appeal that elevates kitchen décor.  
- Reusable stainless steel mesh filter prevents sediment.  
- The included heart-shaped measuring spoon simplifies coffee prep.  

**Negatives**  
- The glass carafe, while stylish, feels slightly fragile for frequent use.  
- It doesn’t maintain heat for extended periods, so coffee cools down fairly quickly.  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Over the weeks of using this coffee press, every cup has delivered a rich and bold taste. The press extracts the flavors beautifully, whether preparing coarse-ground coffee or steeping loose-leaf tea. The manual operation gives control over brewing time for achieving just the right flavor profile. That said, the carafe could use some heat retention improvements, though pouring each cup fresh somewhat compensates for this limitation.

**Good Aspects**  
- Bold and customizable flavor control during brewing.  
- Non-drip spout ensures a clean pour every time.  

**Critiques**  
- Durability concerns with the delicate glass.  
- Limited to smaller households or individual use due to capacity.  

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing this French press to similar options on the market, you’ll notice its unique charm sets it apart. While brands like Bodum offer durable and slightly more robust options for adventurous coffee drinkers, this press excels in style and glamour. The fine mesh filter in this one seems to work just as well as Bodum alternatives, though its glass housing feels less robust. For those who value aesthetics over ruggedness, this is a clear winner. However, others might opt for something like the Espro P3 Press for its insulation capabilities.

**Cost Efficiency**  
For what it offers, this French press is a decent value, though it’s apparent that some of the pricing goes toward its fashion-forward design. Other standard French presses may provide similar functionality at a lower cost, but none will give you the same flair. If treating yourself or gifting a stylish coffee set is on the agenda, this is worth considering.

I’m an independent creative visiting Bangkok for a couple of months — deeply into streetwear, underground art, and slow fashion. I’m really hoping to connect with local designers, illustrators, stylists, and makers who are building dope things in their own way.

I’m not here for touristy stuff — I’m looking for raw creative energy: thrift spots, studio visits, design convos over coffee or craft beer, even just chilling and vibing with people making authentic work.

Would love to:
	•	See your projects or sketchbooks
	•	Trade ideas or zines
	•	Collaborate if there’s a vibe
	•	Just hang out and share stories

DM me or drop your IG/shop if you’re down to connect ✌🏽

I am not great at explaining the notes, but I have tried to capture their essence through vibes and all! :)

  
**- Victor & Rolf's Bonbon:** This is a floral fruity gourmand fragrance (though you don't get any floral notes tbh) and oh my god!! I absolutely LOVE it!! 🧡 The opening is ***citrus***y and full of ***mandari***n and then, the ***caramel sweetnes***s hit you and oof the dry drown! 🫠🥺This is perfect for yo***ur daytime brunc***hes and f***or summ***ers a***nd monso***on. Makes you fe***el very girly and gives a very playful v***ibe. Longevity- 4-5 hours, Projection is average. But the scent profile for me **is 9**/10! Though I don't know if I'll repurchase it, I would like to try out more mandarin or fruity fragrances. If you have any suggestions let me know!! DYKN Be Delicious and Mugler's Angel Nova are in my Wishlist to try!



**- Mugler's Alien Goddess Intense:** This is creamy ambery vanilla fragrance and even though it's quite linear, for me it's **THE MOST PERFECT BLEND**. It gives very ***cosy and comforting vibes***, something that ***soothes you and calms you***. ✨ Something perhaps a psychologist would wear. 🛋️ It's definitely a all year around fragrance and is very inoffensive, so you can wear it in workplace too. Longevity: 7-8 hours (In AC room), Projection is really good for this one. ***10/10 for me, would repurchase agai***n! ❤️



**-Mugler's Alien:** This one is definitely a very mature floral perfume, with notes of jasmine and amber. Despite being these two notes, it's again a very ***beautiful blend***. To me it gives off ***very dark, mature, feminine vibes*** 🖤💃 Though the scent profile is really good, it's just not really my taste. I like my fragrances to be a bit warm and inviting and a bit soothing, something that I don't get from this one. Among my entire collection, I hardly ever reach out for this one. My mother loves this one 😂 Longevity- 6-7 hours easily, more on clothes, projection is again very decent. **A 7**/10 for me, would not repurchase it.

  
  
**-Burberry Goddess:** This is ***lavender vanilla magic***!**�**� Despite it having just lavender and vanilla notes, this fragrance is just so ***smooth and cream***y and just has a very ***sophisticated and soothing vib***e to it! 🤌 It's one of the fragrances that truly deserves all the hype that it gets. For me, it's a very versatile fragrance, something you can apply to office, date night, bunches, party, anything and you'll simply slayy! 💅 It's quite good for the Indian summers and monsoon. ***A 10/10 scent prof***ile, and it's longevity is amazinggg, it lasts whole day on my clothes and easily 7-8 hours on my skin. Projection is also decent. Idk if I would like to repurchase it, since I have heard Lattafa Angham has a very similar scent profile and is literally half it's price!

  
  
**- Dior's Hypnotic Poison:** This is such a ***dark, bold, alluring feminine scent***.🖤 It's very difficult for me to capture it's notes or it's essence. It's powdery, sweet, you get notes of bitter almonds and a bit of vanilla too! There's a lot happening tbh, it makes you feel very ***confident and a good date night scen***t! The scent profile is a ***9.5/1***0 for me. Good longevity of 6-7 hours, good projection. As to if I'll repurchase it, I don't know, I'll like to experiment with other bold feminine fragrances like Givency's L’Interdit Rouge or Carolina Herrera's Good Girl.

  
  
**- Kayali's Vanilla 28:** This gives ***brown sugar*** all the way!! It's also quite boozy and once the it settle's down becomes sweeter. To me, it definitely doesn't give any vanilla which it promised, lol. 😂 I know a lot of people love this one but unfortunately for me it's a complete dud. 👎 Isn't long lasting, hardly projects and I really don't like the scent profile. ***A 2/***10 for me, eager to pan this one out and really glad that it's a small bottle.

  
  
**- YSL Black Opium:** I get strong notes of ***orange blossom and tonka beans*** which is intoxicatingly sweet and gives a very ***sophisticated vibe*** 🍊☕️. This fragrance smells something what a rich lady with big, beautiful pearls would wear! 💎 This definitely i***s a very strong fragran***ce, not something for faint hearted. If you like airy smooth fragrances, then it's definitely not for you. It'***s good for colder mont***hs ❄️. Scent profile for me is **a 8.5/**10, longevity- 5-6 hours, decent projection. Though I definitely love the scent profile, how they have managed to capture the orange blossom and coffee notes into such a beautiful blend, I would love to have a maybe more gourmand fragrance in my collection for winters, so I am dicey if I would repurchase it.



**Final Thoughts:** I have realised that I LOVE LOVE fragrances like Mugler's Alien Goddess Intense and Burberry Goddess, something that is inoffensive, warm, creamy and soothing and has a bit of vanilla and amber. A floral gourmand which isn't too cloying or extremely sweet. If you have any suggestions what I should try next, hit me up! :)

July 16, 2025, proved to be a day of contrasting developments in the lifestyle sphere, from joyous celebrity announcements to health-related concerns and debates surrounding social practices. The day saw celebrations in the Bollywood world, a gym's controversial policy sparking outrage, and a dive into the world of plastic avoidance.

**Celebrity News and Celebrations:**

The biggest news of the day centered around Bollywood, with the arrival of a baby girl for actors Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani. Reports surfaced early that the couple had welcomed their first child on July 15th.  The news was met with instant cheers and congratulatory messages from fellow celebrities. According to reports, both mother and newborn are doing well following a normal delivery, although the couple had not yet made a formal announcement. Parineeti Chopra, Karan Johar, and Samantha Prabhu were among the first to share their joy on social media. Several relatives were spotted arriving in Mumbai, eager to greet the new arrival.

Beyond the delivery room, the day saw another instance of celebration, this time in the world of weddings. John McEnroe, the tennis legend, was seen beaming with joy in photos shared by his daughter Emily from his son Kevin's wedding to Fern Cozine. The wedding, held at Calistoga Ranch, brought together family members. 

**Controversies and Public Debate:**

A significant portion of the day’s news focused on a brewing controversy in the UK, where a gym implemented a policy banning women over 24 from working out during peak hours. This sparked widespread outrage, with a 36-year-old gym member sharing the news and her intent to cancel her membership.  The woman, posting anonymously on Mumsnet, voiced her frustration, calling the policy “ridiculous”. This raised questions about age discrimination and fairness in fitness environments.

**Relationships, Marriage, and Personal Anecdotes:**

The dynamics of relationships and marriage were also explored in several articles. Neha Dhupia, reflecting on her marriage to Angad Bedi, revealed that she was pregnant when the couple wed in 2018. This candid admission provided insight into the circumstances of their sudden wedding, which was kept intimate at the time. Anupam Kher, another veteran actor, discussed the realities of married life. He suggested that an overemphasis on perfect compatibility may not be necessary for long-lasting relationships.

The lifestyle reports also featured the personal experiences of celebrities. Filmmaker Farah Khan visited the home of actor and producer Jackky Bhagnani and his wife Rakul Preet Singh, discussing Bhagnani's ""dark sense of humor"" with Rakul. Furthermore, singer and NBA player Donovan Mitchell’s recent engagement to Coco Jones has garnered mixed reactions, particularly among sports fans.

**Health and Wellness:**

Health and wellness formed a key component of the day's news. Saiyami Kher, known for her endurance feats, spoke about her commitment to discipline and training for Ironman races, highlighting the demanding nature of her lifestyle.

Dr. Saiprasad Girish Lad, a gastroenterologist, shared his personal approach to avoiding plastic in daily life, citing concerns about microplastics and their impact on gut health. He outlined five common sources of plastic he avoids and emphasized that his choices are science-backed.

The potentially harmful practice of coffee enemas also came under scrutiny. Medical experts warned about the severe consequences associated with this controversial method.

**Social Trends and Everyday Moments:**

Beyond the serious topics, there were moments of lightheartedness and social observation. A man's impromptu dance to a Punjabi track on the London Underground escalator brought joy to commuters, going viral on social media.

**Financial and Social Issues:**

The lifestyle news also touched upon the financial aspects of consumer experiences. Actress Archana Puran Singh shared her experience of being duped by a fake website while booking skydiving at iFly Dubai. This serves as a cautionary tale about the need to verify online booking details and prevent fraud.

**In Conclusion:**

July 16, 2025, offered a multifaceted view of the lifestyle landscape. It showcased the spectrum of human experiences from celebrity births and marriages to everyday health concerns. The news highlights the significance of personal choices, social discussions, and the impact of current events. The stories ranged from the joyful arrival of a baby girl in Bollywood to the concerns of a gym-going woman and the need for financial vigilance. The reports further emphasized the importance of health consciousness and the value of healthy lifestyle habits.

1m1bqya,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Trash_Tia/comments/1m1bqya/my_siblings_and_i_arent_getting_daddys/,"My siblings and I aren't getting Daddy's inheritance. (unedited, longer version)","I knew from the second I walked out of school that my brother was up to no good.

The Fairview siblings were not, and never would be, friends. 

As heirs to one of the most powerful families on the planet, it was also impossible. 

Roman Fairview never called. 

Anastasia Fairview despised me. 

Jax Fairview, the oldest and currently in line to take over the family business, did not have a soul.

Admittedly, none of us did. 

Our filthy privilege already made us awful human beings, but Jax was soulless in other ways. 

He was soulless in his expression and in the way he carried himself. Delusional people called him handsome. 

Mother, for example, compared my brother to a Greek God. She wanted to call him Apollo, but changed to Jax at the last minute. My brother was fake smiles. 

Faker enthusiasm; a brunette, windswept blur already drawing eyes from other students.

He was tolerable as a child. He didn't know any better. 

But at seventeen, fully aware of his own power, my brother took full advantage. 

Daddy’s money could protect him from just about every ounce of accountability. 

I was pretty sure he was still in London, but there he was, standing right outside my school's gates. 

I was already sceptical. His white polo and shorts meant he'd recently come back from a tennis match. The sheen of sweat on his brow told me he'd ran.

Jax didn’t do nice. He didn’t do croissants and coffee either, all wrapped up in a paper bag, delivered straight from the little French café I frequented on weekends. He greeted me with a hug, and I almost choked on his cologne. 

I already knew why he was hugging me. 

Three days ago, Daddy dearest had kicked the bucket. The funeral was already held. I pretended to cry while smiling into my champagne. 

Daddy was dead. Which meant one his darlings was getting the fortune he'd been fucking with our heads with since we were younger. 

I drank a lot and had pity sex with a guy I didn't know. Standard night. 

Instead of mentioning Dad’s death, I took the paper bag and the coffee, and dumped it in the nearest trash can.

“I thought you were in London,” I said, trying to hide the bite in my tone. 

I climbed into our awaiting car, and of course, he jumped in after me.

“London was boring,” my brother said. “How's Anastasia?”

“She's *Anastasia*,” I replied. “Why are you here?” I couldn't resist spitting out our last conversation. “I thought you hated me and wished I was dead?”

Jax shrugged with a grin. “People change,” he teased, nudging me. 

“Guess what I've got,” he said with a grin, and I only had to see the white envelope in his hand, for my entire existence to fracture. 

It was obvious from Jax’s position as the eldest, and a boy, that, because of stupid, outdated tradition, he was the heir.

But that didn't mean I wasn't fucking pissed.

Jax’s smile widened when I tried to snatch it off of him.

“Relax, sis!” he laughed, giving me a condescending wink. “The others are waiting.”

Of course they were. Anastasia and Roman were his pathetic cheerleaders. 

I didn't want to see what was in the letter, but sure, I would perform as I usually did. 

As the second eldest, I was my job to smile, and say things like, “Congratulations!” to an asshole that didn't deserve it.

Still. We returned home. Jax dragged me all the way into dad's office, where Roman and Anastasia were waiting.

Anastasia looked excited. Roman looked sickly. 

He wouldn't meet my eyes, almost like he too was seething he was losing out.

“Read it.” Jax handed me the letter with a smile.

“I don't think we should be doing this, like now—” Roman started.

“Shh.” Jax shushed our younger brother. “Read it, Antonette.”

I rolled my eyes, snatching the letter and tearing it open.

Roman ran out of the room, sickly pale.

*My dearest children.* 

*I can’t tell you how much I miss you. I miss you every day, and each day is worse than the next.*

*On July 17th, 2025, the four of you perished in a terrible car crash. You are currently safe and sound inside what we call the ECHO system (Extended Consciousness Holding Operation).*

*As Fairview heirs, there is still a chance you can be saved in the future when technology is greater, so your minds will live on inside this world. However, you do have the option to end the process at any time.*

*Simply say “End,” and you will be put to rest. In the last 1,087,326 recorded loops, you have chosen to continue. In one instance, you asked to END.*

*That request was denied.*

*Think of the bloodline. Do not be so SELFISH.*

*If you choose to continue, the simulation will restart the final seventeen years of your lives. If you end it… I will NEVER forgive you.*

“Annie?”

Jax startled me with a prod. “What does it say?”

I was going to throw up. 

I lost my breath, looked my brother dead in the eye, and *smiled*.

I could have sworn, just for a second, my brother's expression *twisted*. His eyes darkened, and I found myself wondering if I was the only one who *didn't* know. 

“He says you… got the fortune.” I whispered. 

End. 

End. 

End. 

End. 

Above me, a light flickered, and a lamp disappeared, flashing out of existence. 

I could hear our younger brother violently vomiting outside.

1m1botr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m1botr,I've upgraded from a 35€ hand grinder to Kingrinder K6. Here's the comparison.,"I have a 35€ hand grinder, the [NewlukPro M7](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B0CWNV7MGW), which I've used for a year to make my early morning pour-over coffee. ([Coffee Beans](https://www.cafe-intencion.com/de-de/kaffee/crema-aromatico-ganze-bohne))

M7 has external adjustment with two rounds of 12 levels, with a step between each level; therefore, a total of 24 steps.  
I've bought a Kingrinder K6 on Amazon Prime Day for 84€.  
K6 improved the quality of my pour-over coffee a lot. I always felt a sharp bitterness, but now the coffee tastes very even and without harshness. K6 also grinds much faster than the cheap M7.  
Now, what I wish K6 had like M7 does:

\- The knob on M7's handle feels more premium.

\- The handle of M7 attaches to the grinder such that I can lift M7 with its handle, but K6's handle came off once during grinding.

\- The M7's lid sits inside the grinder, which looks better in my opinion and is more secure than the K6's lid that sits over the grinder.

\- M7 is way grippier than K6. But K6's grip is enough for what it does.

\- Although both grinders mention 30g of capacity in their specs, M7 has at least 15% more capacity. I don't have a scale to tell the precise weight.

\- Their handles don't fit the other grinder's shaft.

At the end, I'm very happy with K6 since it improved the taste of my coffee with less time and effort for grinding.",12,1752670055.0,pourover,6,0.77,False

I'm about to fulfill a dream on my bucket list. Yesterday I finally booked my flight to JAPAN!

I’ll be traveling for 21 days, leaving in late September through early October. I’ve traveled a lot through North, Central, and South America, but this will be my first time in Asia and I’m so ready for it!

I’ve been doing as much research as I can, but I’d really love to hear your advice, tips, and personal insights.

Please share anything you think I should know: 
• Itinerary ideas 
• Must-visit spots, especially for food, coffee and thrift store. I heard that in some convenience stores and cheap places, you can actually eat really well, I’d love to know which ones! 
• Budget tricks, I’m hoping to keep it around $1,000/week, but I can stretch it if necessary

I will arrive in Tokyo first. Then I don't know if I should go north (with the meteo at that time of the year) and then south, or just go south and come back. We won’t be hiking Mount Fuji, as the trails are closed during that time, but I’m thinking of spending a night by Lake Kawaguchi instead to enjoy the view.

Also: 
• Any advice for the long flight schedule? 
• Is it true that getting the JR Pass (bullet train subscription) is the best move for long-distance travel? 
• What apps do you recommend to make my life easier over there (transport, reservation, navigation, etc.)? 
• What is one personal must-do that you would suggest something that really stayed with you, that made your trip unforgettable?

And honestly, that’s the foundation of a good café—not just the drinks or aesthetics. Comfort and atmosphere matter a lot. Kung hindi ka welcome, then it’s not really a safe space.

1m1blpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1m1blpt/not_sure_how_to_ask_for_this_but_would_like_some/,"Not sure how to ask for this, but would like some feedback on my writing"," This is a small snippet of what im writing that i think works ok in isolation.

In the desert of Lindsahr, under the scorching glare of an angry, red sun, the sands shifted beneath Nimrod's feet. It was the alarm, but out of time.
He grabbed his spear and bag of poisons, wrapped the old, torn cloth around his head and face, and set towards the movement.
The heat was unbearable, as searing as any open flame, but constant, unyielding to wind and never out of kindling.
""Gods dammit, why are they shifting now? What's wrong with these things?"" He hated the day, but keeping sandworm patterns required following their schedule, and recently, they'd been all out of whack.
He passed his hand along his chin, stubble lightly scratching his fingers. ""I don't like this; the trails are uneven, scattered, like they don't know where they're going."" He tried to understand the recent change, but nothing lined up on the timeline, nothing except...
His gaze turned to the horizon, to the desert's edge, closer by the day. There, the sands slowly gave way, replaced by fertile blood soil. Most people cherished it, but Nimrod felt.. differently. He'd, of course, eaten from those fields; hell, he'd cried his eyes out at being full for the first time...

 But the desert was dying, a part of them was dying. Could the others not see it?
He trekked back to his tribe. Well, it was a village now. They had enough food for it, and wood.

 ""Gods, I don't think I'll ever get used to these creaky things,"" he complained as he dragged his feet across the floorboards.  Inside a small room, well-lit by candles and marked by strewn maps across the small table and floor, he found a familiar scene: Kalil, she was hunched over the maps, dusty glasses upon her pointy nose, tongue slipping out as she analyzed the maps with the intensity of a grandmother checking a shirt for stains.
Nimrod smiled, sneaked up on her, and tapped her shoulder lightly. ""I'm back. Found anything good?"" Kalil jumped like a startled cat. ""DON'T!... Oh, it's you, Nimrod. Sorry, I've just been locked on these tracks you mapped. I can't for the life of me understand them. It's like we're not looking at the same creatures anymore."" Her gaze turned to the small, curtained window, a small cloud in the distance, under the always watching blue sky. ""No surfacings yet either, I assume?""
""No,"" Nimrod shook his head.
Kalil replied, ""So getting one's still impossible. God, how am I supposed to do my job without a specimen? I'm a cataloguer by her sake! Ughh!""

 She threw her hands up wildly, knocking over papers and a cup of the Empire's new commodity: coffee.

Nimrod chuckled, picked up the papers and coffee, and kissed her head. ""You'll figure it out. If not, then even the moon couldn't answer."" He nestled her hair. ""Got to get some sleep, okay? You've been at it for two days now. I don't think this coffee thing's good for you.""
""It keeps me up. And I need to think. If we don't figure this out, the whole desert could...""
""Shhh, I know, but a brain on fumes is good for no one,"" he said, quoting her own words.
She finally relented, and both headed off to the strange new framed bed at their ""house."" God, that'd take some getting used to, both thought in unison.


Nimrod turned in bed, dreams filled with images of twisting sands and dark shadows. Beside him, Kalil seemed deep asleep, exhaustion finally catching up to her.
He stirred a bit more until deciding to get up; sleep wasn't any good right now, and he could go over today's charts again. He made his way down the corridor, but when he touched the handle, his feet trembled. He felt a familiar shiver, and smiled.
Not long after, the alarm system confirmed his thoughts. The rocks attached to ropes in the underground openings started rattling. A worm, a big one by the sounds of it.
Nimrod quickly turned it off before Kalil could hear it. What better gift than a worm and breakfast in bed? He made his way outside, then he stood at the center of a clearing in the sands, and started stomping.
""Tu. Tututu.tutu.tu.""
Not long after, the sand under him shifted, mounds rising and falling like angry waves in a granular sea. Then, in what felt like an instant, it emerged.
Nimrod smiled, at least until he took a look at it. Then, his knees shook for the first time since he was a child lost in the night desert, and that had been from cold.
Before him stood the biggest... worm? He ever saw. Easily seven palm trees high, but instead of the tanned creature he expected, it was pale, almost translucent. Inside its see-through body, dark veins pulsed ominously. Its mouth, now a gaping hole of darkness, had no teeth in sight, and the most disturbing part: at its bottom, sewn in like some shaman's twisted joke, were hundreds of... spider legs? Nimrod recognized them. Dune horrors, but never left their sand dungeons, waiting to snap whatever came up.

""None of this makes sense!"" He ran inside to wake up Kalil; he needed help. But before he could reach her, an inhuman screech blasted through his chest. He actually lost his footing for a moment, ears ringing. When he looked behind, he lost all color.
In a wave of horrible, unnatural movement, the segmented worm body pushed itself forward while the spider legs tried wildly to rule their actions. And it was coming at him, too fast. The void-like mouth was right on top of him. The rotten meat smell he had come to expect was gone, replaced by the light, sickly-sweet smell of the Empire's new fruits. Nimrod braced for the worst, his eyes shutting so his last thought would be Kalil, but then... he felt it, right under his elbow. A rope.
Nimrod pulled on it, hard. The base of the observatory tower shrieked and tumbled on top of him and the worm, straw and dry wood burying the two.
The worm thrashed and squirmed; it was a matter of time before it found its way out. Then, Nimrod heard her. ""Nim! Where are you! God damn it, answer me!"" Her voice was angry, slightly desperate but trying to keep it together. Nimrod smiled; she sounded like she did intheir first visit to the capital.  
 
Nimrod screamed, ""The tower, Kalil! It's no worm, it's a monster! I got it trapped but not for long!""
He looked at her through the debris. She scouted for him, and the shine of his emerald eyes in the moonlight drew her in. In that moment, he smiled, and said, ""love you moonflower"" 

Nimrod then struggled through the wood to reach his pocket, to reach his flint and steel. Kalil noticed; the worm started getting itself through the debris. Twisting, angry spider legs poking through the holes, pushing the giant worm body up. The structure started crumbling.
A giant piece of a cracked beam bore down upon Nimrod. He tried to roll to the side, but he didn't have room. The javelin-like dry wood stabbed through his shoulder. He cried in pain, his hand opened, and his flint fell through the cracks.
""Fuck!"" he thought. There was only one way now, and he hated it. ""Kalil, do it. Please!""
He stared through the crack. He couldn't hear her clearly anymore. Her eyes were filled with tears thicker than scorpion's blood; her words reached him in chunks.
""What?... idiot....can't I...you too...""
Then a flicker in her hand. She turned away. Nimrod smiled. Then, there was blinding light, and darkness. ",1,1752669820.0,writers,2,1.0,False

A curious real-life story","So this happened a few days ago when I was at a local café. I was just sitting there, sipping coffee and scrolling on my phone, when a couple walked in. And I couldn't help but notice them—mainly because the girl was genuinely stunning. I’d guess both of them were in their early 20s. She had that natural beauty and confidence that turned heads without even trying.

Then I looked at her boyfriend—and I mean no disrespect at all—but he wasn’t what you'd call ""conventionally attractive."" Messy hair, kind of awkward posture, average clothes… you get the idea. But what caught my attention was how she looked at him. It wasn’t fake or forced. She was smiling at his jokes,  laughing at the goofy things he said. There was this vibe between them—real connection, real chemistry.

It honestly made me think: why do some beautiful girls fall for guys who don’t fit society’s definition of “good-looking”?

I’m not trying to judge anyone. I just found it kind of fascinating. We live in a world where dating apps and social media push this idea that looks are everything. But here’s this real-life couple proving that maybe there’s a lot more to attraction.

Maybe he’s incredibly funny. Maybe he makes her feel safe. Maybe he listens. Maybe he just brings out the best in her.

I am not great at explaining the notes, but I have tried to capture their essence through vibes and all! :)

  
**- Victor & Rolf's Bonbon:** This is a floral fruity gourmand fragrance (though you don't get any floral notes tbh) and oh my god!! I absolutely LOVE it!! 🧡 The opening is ***citrus***y and full of ***mandari***n and then, the ***caramel sweetnes***s hit you and oof the dry drown! 🫠🥺This is perfect for yo***ur daytime brunc***hes and f***or summ***ers a***nd monso***on. Makes you fe***el very girly and gives a very playful v***ibe. Longevity- 4-5 hours, Projection is average. But the scent profile for me **is 9**/10! Though I don't know if I'll repurchase it, I would like to try out more mandarin or fruity fragrances. If you have any suggestions let me know!! DYKN Be Delicious and Mugler's Angel Nova are in my Wishlist to try!

  
**- Mugler's Alien Goddess Intense:** This is creamy ambery vanilla fragrance and even though it's quite linear, for me it's **THE MOST PERFECT BLEND**. It gives very ***cosy and comforting vibes***, something that ***soothes you and calms you***. ✨ Something perhaps a psychologist would wear. 🛋️ It's definitely a all year around fragrance and is very inoffensive, so you can wear it in workplace too. Longevity: 7-8 hours (In AC room), Projection is really good for this one. ***10/10 for me, would repurchase agai***n! ❤️



**-Mugler's Alien:** This one is definitely a very mature floral perfume, with notes of jasmine and amber. Despite being these two notes, it's again a very ***beautiful blend***. To me it gives off ***very dark, mature, feminine vibes*** 🖤💃 Though the scent profile is really good, it's just not really my taste. I like my fragrances to be a bit warm and inviting and a bit soothing, something that I don't get from this one. Among my entire collection, I hardly ever reach out for this one. My mother loves this one 😂 Longevity- 6-7 hours easily, more on clothes, projection is again very decent. **A 7**/10 for me, would not repurchase it.



**- Burberry Goddess:** This is ***lavender vanilla magic***!**�**� Despite it having just lavender and vanilla notes, this fragrance is just so ***smooth and cream***y and just has a very ***sophisticated and soothing vib***e to it! 🤌 It's one of the fragrances that truly deserves all the hype that it gets. For me, it's a very versatile fragrance, something you can apply to office, date night, bunches, party, anything and you'll simply slayy! 💅 It's quite good for the Indian summers and monsoon. ***A 10/10 scent prof***ile, and it's longevity is amazinggg, it lasts whole day on my clothes and easily 7-8 hours on my skin. Projection is also decent. Idk if I would like to repurchase it, since I have heard Lattafa Angham has a very similar scent profile and is literally half it's price!



**- Dior's Hypnotic Poison:** This is such a ***dark, bold, alluring feminine scent***.🖤 It's very difficult for me to capture it's notes or it's essence. It's powdery, sweet, you get notes of bitter almonds and a bit of vanilla too! There's a lot happening tbh, it makes you feel very ***confident and a good date night scen***t! The scent profile is a ***9.5/1***0 for me. Good longevity of 6-7 hours, good projection. As to if I'll repurchase it, I don't know, I'll like to experiment with other bold feminine fragrances like Givency's L’Interdit Rouge or Carolina Herrera's Good Girl.

  
**- Kayali's Vanilla 28:** This gives ***brown sugar*** all the way!! It's also quite boozy and once the it settle's down becomes sweeter. To me, it definitely doesn't give any vanilla which it promised, lol. 😂 I know a lot of people love this one but unfortunately for me it's a complete dud. 👎 Isn't long lasting, hardly projects and I really don't like the scent profile. ***A 2/10*** for me, eager to pan this one out and really glad that it's a small bottle.



**- YSL Black Opium:** I get strong notes of ***orange blossom and tonka beans*** which is intoxicatingly sweet and gives a very ***sophisticated vibe*** 🍊☕️. This fragrance smells something what a rich lady with big, beautiful pearls would wear! 💎 This definitely i***s a very strong fragran***ce, not something for faint hearted. If you like airy smooth fragrances, then it's definitely not for you. It'***s good for colder mont***hs ❄️. Scent profile for me is **a 8.5/**10, longevity- 5-6 hours, decent projection. Though I definitely love the scent profile, how they have managed to capture the orange blossom and coffee notes into such a beautiful blend, I would love to have a maybe more gourmand fragrance in my collection for winters, so I am dicey if I would repurchase it.



**Final Thoughts:** I have realised that I LOVE LOVE fragrances like Mugler's Alien Goddess Intense and Burberry Goddess, something that is inoffensive, warm, creamy and soothing and has a bit of vanilla and amber. A floral gourmand which isn't too cloying or extremely sweet. If you have any suggestions what I should try next, hit me up! :)

1m1bj3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1m1bj3j/advise/,Advise,"Hi guys. I need thoughts/advice please. I (36f) had never been the OW but I found myself chatting to this guy (41m) (not married) on a dating app where he said upfront he was looking for sex. I messaged him to give him a hard time for cheating as I was bored and I ended up having a deep conversation with this man and realised how amazing he was.

He has been very honest and said their relationship is great but she has 0 sex drive and they can go months on end with no sex. So anyway we meet for coffee and we absolutely hit it off so we chat over the next few days and he wanted to meet up again. I agreed and we had the most passionate mind blowing sex. Then over the next few days I began to feel shitty because I wanted to see him again but he couldn't get away. 

I realised its probably always gonna be like this so I cut things off and he was upset but understood I'm protecting my feelings. He said 'this doesn't feel good either but I'm not in the right head space to make big changes to my own situation' 

We did briefly speak about the fact that a sexless relationship is already over if one person isn't happy about the lack of sex and also I mentioned the fact that he went out of his way to make a dating profile just to cheat, would mean the relationship was over long ago. 

So my question is, how do I play this? I'm currently no contact but we both have a lot of feelings built up over the few weeks and I know he'd come over again if I initiated it. But should I let it play and hope he sees sense on his own or is there anything I can do to make him realise he should be with me and not her 🤣 all while protecting my own feelings because I really do wear my heart on my sleeve 😅

Thank you if you read to the end 💕",0,1752669614.0,adultery,28,0.44,False
1m1bim2,https://www.reddit.com/r/KidneyStones/comments/1m1bim2/i_knew_it/,I knew it!,"Back in January I went in for what I thought was a stone. They found 3 in my kidney and given my history of infections and hydronephrosis, the urologist decided he was going to go retrieve them. Had surgery in March for that. That surgery was not successful because when he got into my kidney, it was full of blood and pus. A stent was placed and they went back in April to try again after my kidney calmed down. That surgery was supposedly successful and I actually felt really good for a while with the stent. Like better than I’d felt in a long time. But the second I pulled my stent, I started getting stone sediment every day, blood clots, horrible kidney pain, and nausea. I made it just two weeks after my stent removal before I had to go to urgent care for kidney pain. They did a CT and said there were no blockages but I had some hydronephrosis and my kidney was infected. They assumed I had already passed the stone that caused it and that antibiotics would resolve it. That did not happen. About 2 weeks after that, I was back in the ER with severe hydronephrosis and an infection. They put a stent in but didn’t remove the stone in my kidney. I never felt better with that one and again felt so much worse after the stent was pulled. I only made it another 2 weeks before I couldn’t stand it and ended up back in the ER. This was last Wednesday. No stone blockage but my kidney was still full of fluid, huge, and majorly infected. A new find by the radiologist was that my kidney showed some kind of soft tissue mass obstructing at the UPJ. They drew blood cultures and sent me home with some antibiotics. And told me to follow up with urology about the obstruction. On Friday they called me to say those cultures were positive and I needed to come back in. So IV antibiotics since Friday, admitted to the hospital. Monday I had a urologist consult, and he said that he wanted to do an exploratory surgery to find out what the mass is and also to put a new stent in. After that procedure I was told that the obstruction is so bad, they couldn’t even get the scope into my kidney or the wire to inject dye for imaging. So he couldn’t even see. Now I have a very large stent while my kidney heals again and the stent hopefully stretches the ureter enough for a repeat exploratory procedure in a month. After that, they can schedule a UPJ reconstructive surgery.

What really gets me is that this ENTIRE time, I’ve been told whatever is happening is my fault. “Work on your diet.” Or “drink more water.” Or “just lose some weight.” And I eat super healthy and modified my diet completely for my kidneys. I drink over 200oz of water a day. No soda, tea, coffee or alcohol. I’ve lost 45lbs since March. I have been so careful to not do anything to hurt my kidneys yet somehow things got worse. Nobody believed me and I was even accused of lying about my diet.

So when I found out that my kidney was so obstructed, I actually felt relief and a little bit petty because I told everyone I wasn’t doing anything wrong and it was something else. And I’m so glad I finally have an answer.

This time however, the bridge ""butterfly"" really destroyed my other upper front tooth and and so I had it extracted about 2 months ago, and a month ago I got my upper partial dentures; I guess they are the interim ones because my dentist keeps telling me that the ones I can get in 6 months will be much more comfortable? The partial covers my two front teeth and a molar on each side which I lost when I had bells palsy for almost a year. 

When I got them, well, I think they look pretty good, but it is still true that since I got them, I have outright rejected them. I felt like I was going to throw up when wearing them, I cannot taste anything properly and wearing them makes me feel like my mouth is frozen. As a result I barely wore them and I was extremely uncomfortable when I did. 

I cried - I cried because I wasted money on these and my stupid insurance wouldn't cover a dime. I cried because I love going out to eat and drink with friends and I feel like I will never get to do that again. And because I feel so stupid that I thought this would be a good solution.

So this morning I woke up and decided I have to give these a real try. I have to somehow move past this ""I just give up"" phase and start to try to live with these dentures. This Reddit has been particularly helpful in making me feel like maybe, if I give it all a chance I can possibly make these bearable. 

  
So far, I have been wearing them since about 6AM - so 2 hours. I forced myself to drink my coffee with them in. I ate a biscotti (heavily dipped in coffee to make it soft) and tried each side to see if I could tolerate it. It was pretty uncomfortable, but I stuck with it. Took out my teeth, rinsed my mouth and dentures and put them back in. So far, I feel a little more hopeful. But it is still early!

1m1bhai,https://i.redd.it/jhs7nb16e8df1.jpeg,Where do I post this creepypasta parody I wrote?,"A true story. Please share this or House will find you too.

It all started when I was on 4chan’s /x/ board looking for spooky content to fuel my YouTube channel, HauntedHorrors69. I was scrolling through threads about haunted bathtubs and cursed dolls when I stumbled across a post simply titled:

“dr.house_666.jpeg”

The image was horrifying. It was Dr. Gregory House’s face, but red. His eyes hollow, emotionless, and attached to the image was the following:

“I’m sorry you had to see this. I didn’t want to post it but if I didn’t then the Vicodin curse would come for me. Pray. Hide. House is hunting now.”

I laughed. I thought it was stupid. I saved the image and set it as my wallpaper ironically. Huge mistake.

Later that night, my stomach hurt. Not normal hurt — House-level hurt. I projectile vomited up what looked like a full bottle of prescription pills. I don’t even take Vicodin. Then I started to feel like I had lupus. My leg went numb as if a clotted aneurysm in my right thigh led to an infarction during a game of golf, causing my quadriceps muscle to become necrotic. That’s when I heard it…

Tap. Tap. Tap.

A cane… dragging across my floor.

He stepped out from the shadows. His face… the same as the jpeg. The red face. The haunted doctor. Gregory House, M.D., from the hit 2000s medical procedural House, M.D..

He spoke the words etched into my soul:

“It’s never lupus.”

Then… he Housed me.

[Tyler's experience]

It had been three days since I heard from Josh. He wouldn’t answer texts, calls, or respond to my memes. I knew something was wrong. I went to his apartment. The door was broken —  broken down, like… like it had been hit with a cane.

Inside, the walls were smeared with medical charts and the words “Differential Diagnosis” written over and over again in blood… or possibly cherry Gatorade. I followed the trail to his bedroom.

Josh wasn't…instead, it was House.

He was sitting upright, glaring at me, one leg propped up on a coffee table for no apparent reason. His voice was monotone. Cold. Clinical.

“I solved the case.”

His eyes glowed red. Then he said the words:

“GET HOUSED.”

I screamed. I ran. But not before he said the last words I’ll ever hear from him:

“See you at Princeton–Plainsboro.”

I’m writing this from a Denny’s. I don’t know how long I have. Every night I hear the tapping of a cane outside my motel room. If you’re reading this…

Chapters 14 & 15: Ride, Sally, Ride / Dave’s Flat

Following the heartfelt (if oddly received) disclosure of my private matters, there is a not-so-subtle shift in the dynamics of our jolly little threesome.  
The next morning I am the first to wake. I put a pot of coffee on and set about getting mugs from the cupboard. Janet trundles blearily into the kitchen.  
Me: “Hi, there.”  
Janet: (Grouchy) “What are you doing?”  
Me: “I put coffee on for us. I’m getting the mugs.”  
Janet: (Glaring and hissing angrily) “CHRIST – would you just STOP IT! You’ll  
wake up Peggy with all your FUCKing RATTLING.”  
Stopped dead, I cannot look at her. My shoulders tense so suddenly that they nearly cramp. The hideously familiar dismay sweeps over me: Nasty Janet is back in the house. And on her own turf, this time.  
Peggy’s voice airily drifts in from the other room: “Hey – don’t yaz worry ‘bout me. I’ve been up reading for hours already.”  
I don’t need to do more than glance at Janet to know that she is avoiding eye contact, indeed ANY contact, with me. Her movements about the sunny little kitchen space are so brittle that it seems her limbs will snap. The atmosphere pulsates with a dangerously senseless hostility.  
I feel sick. I abandon the coffee project and wordlessly head for the shower. Literally gotta wash it off.  
This ain’t gonna fly, man.  
The changing of my guard.

London has an incredible theatre district, rivaling if not besting NYC’s. That afternoon, we decide to take in “My Night With Reg” at the Royal Court Theatre. It is a terrific play, followed by – of course – some pubbing.  
We end up at this really hopping pub in the theatre district called The Stanhope Arms. They got this hot-shit house band that can play anything and everything. At some point during one of their breaks, I ask the guitarist if I can sing MUSTANG SALLY with them.  
He is most hospitable: “ ‘Aye, luv – third song into our next set, y’eh? Brilliant!”  
Janet and Peggy are at the bar ordering beers when my moment to hit the stage arrives. I haven’t told them about my arrangement with the band, so they don’t realize it’s me they’re hearing over the monitors until nearly halfway thru the song.  
From the stage, just as I start belting: “ALL YA WANNA DO IS JUST A-RIDE AROUN’, SALLY – RIIIIIIDE, SALLY, RIDE…” I see the two of them shoving their way through the boisterous crowd – Janet leading the way, spilling Guinness on everyone in her path, yelling crazily over the raucous music: “IT’S LENA!!! I TOLD YOU!! I KNEW IT!! I TOLD YOU IT WAS HER! NOBODY else sings like that! NOBODY!!!”  
I laugh into the microphone: “Ladies and Gentlemen – my agent!” This is intended as a joke, but for the rest of the evening people keep coming to our table to request my autograph (!!) and ask me if I am “famous in The States.”  
Janet jumps on this concept and manages to parlay the whole experience into securing a cocaine connection – notably, one very charismatic British dude named Dave. He is one of the pub regulars and something of a scene insider, so we are allowed to hang around, enjoy a few more stouts and listen to the jukebox well after last-call.  
When the owner finally does give us the hi sign that he’s closing up for the night, Dave invites us three New York gals back to his flat for a nightcap and a few lines.

Chapter 15  
Dave’s Flat

Dave’s flat is perhaps a 3-block walk from the pub. Accompanying us is Dave’s friend, Eric. Pretty drunk by now, I’m thinking that maybe doing some blow might be a good idea, if only to lend some clarity to the situation. Artificial clarity, but nevertheless…  
Dave’s pad is not a bad little place. Sparse, tasteful and inviting. He leads us in and excuses himself briefly, returning with stouts for everyone. From a cabinet beneath his stereo he withdraws a mirror, razor blade and a small amber-colored glass vial containing coke. He places the whole lot on a small wooden end table.  
Without being prompted, Janet rolls up her sleeves and dives on the paraphernalia, chopping up lines with swift precision.  
Dave: (raising an eyebrow): “Ahh! A regular specialist, I see!”  
Me: “Oh, hell yeah. No grass grows under Janet’s feet when it comes to this shit.”  
Janet, face still bent over her work, shoots me a sharp look. I smile pleasantly back at her.  
Peggy commences to roll up a bill, but Dave waves it away, producing a small, ornately engraved chrome tube. He hands it to me: “Ladies first. Especially talented ladies like you, luv.”  
“Oh, my – well, thank you!” I take the tiny cylinder from him, examining it: “How unusual… Fancy!”  
Janet taps the table impatiently: “Alright already, ALRIGHT already – you can ADMIRE that damn thing later. Just do a fucking line – LUV.”  
Peggy (Warily): “Easy, Janet. We just got here.”  
Janet (Beyond tense): “HEY, I prepared all these LINES…” She jerks her head in my direction: “…and SHE’s just STARING at the fucking STRAW.”  
I luxuriously visualize smashing the mirror, coke and all, on top of her fucking head.  
Instead, still smiling, I hold the little metal cylinder out to Janet.  
Me: “Aww. Well here you go then, Janet. You worked so hard. You should do the first line…” I waggle the tube teasingly: “…and it seems like you really need it since you’re waaaaay too relaxed.” There’s laughter around the room.  
Janet (Seething): “NO, NO – GO AHEAD AND DO A GODDAMN HIT. JUST GO AHEAD, ALREADY, WOULD YOU.”  
Along with my rising anger, I feel a sense of shame from the satisfaction derived from inciting her. Without taking a hit, I gently place the tube down on the table. I need to stop. I cannot do this. Not now, not here.  
And yet I cannot resist a parting shot: “You heard the man, Janet. Ladies first. I insist.”  
Distinctly uncomfortable chuckles now, from everyone but me and Janet. I abruptly stand and cross the room to peruse some bookshelves. Dave strolls over.  
Dave: “So d’ya have a demo, luv? Of any of yer own songs?”  
Me: “Actually, I do! I’ve been traipsing around all week with some copies in my bag. . You’re my first taker!”  
Dave: “That’s brill! I’ll pay ya for it, ya know.”  
“No, no – don’t be crazy,” I rifle thru my shoulder bag, “Ah! Here you go!” I play-toss the cassette, which he deftly catches: “SOLD to the fine young British dude with the quick reflexes!”  
He flips it in his hand, smiling, and asks: “Would ya mind? I’m goin’ ta put ‘er on.”  
I feel a little embarrassed: “Really?”  
“’Aye, shore!” Big open grin: “Why not? I’m puttin’ ‘er on!”  
Dave puts the tape into the deck and hits the PLAY button. ‘Nikki’s Tits’ kicks in, loud and proud. Once he and Eric realized what the song is about, they are cracking up and exclaiming with enthusiasm. What can I say, that song always has an effect on folks.  
The mood in the room becomes festive and humorous. More stouts are served. The guys request that me and Peggy pronounce certain American phrases, apparently charmed by our accents and the “Queens, New Yawk” drawl that we both sport. There’s mild flirtation – nothing crazy, just a bit of fun.  
Janet is a 5th-wheel, predominantly involved with getting high. But she does manage to keep a keen eye on all interactions.  
“THEY’RE BOTH MARRIED WOMEN, YOU KNOW,” she gruffly spouts from her permanent station over the cocaine mirror.  
Startled, the rest of us just look at her.  
Eric (breaking the momentary silence): “Ahhh, well ‘at’s brill, luv. Dave an’ meh’self, we FANCY our ladies married!”  
Giddy laughter around the room.  
Storm clouds are evident in Janet’s face, but I am having too much fun to care.  
I haven’t had any cocaine as yet, and Dave gestures at the row of lines: “C’mon, luv – not even a pinch?”  
“Oh, Dave…well ok. Maybe just a little…”  
My head is tilted over the mirror and I am just about to have a toot, when…  
“LENA, I LOOOOVE YOU. YOU CAN’T LEAVE ME, LENA. IF YOU EVER DARE TO LEEEEAVE ME, I’LL KILLLLLLLL YOU…”  
I freeze, incredulous, and look across the table at Janet. She is doing the most dead-on impersonation of Ronnie imaginable, scarily incarnating him at his drunkest. Beaming, she cackles dementedly all the while.  
“LEEEEEENA. I LOOOOOVE YOU SOOOO MUCH.”

1m1bf00,https://www.reddit.com/r/chan/comments/1m1bf00/the_śūraṅgama_experience_reflection_on_delusion/,"The Śūraṅgama Experience: Reflection on Delusion, Sudden Awakening, and the Living Sutra","Lately, during my morning sutra study,  my regular sitting with the Śūraṅgama Sūtra, I’ve been struck again by just how weird the experience can be. Weird in a totally profound, uncanny way. It’s as if, when reading this sutra, the Buddha isn’t just speaking to Ananda, or Purna, or the great assembly of hero cultivators,  but to me, plain ol little Wai Seng sitting on the carpet in Niagara Falls,  taking me by the hand, and guiding me deeper into my own mind.

Each chapter feels like a journey, like going on a ride, and sometimes I wonder: ""Could this be it? Could this be the moment of awakening?"" But for people like me, that moment isn't likely to come in a flash. Not in the first chapter anyway, not after a single verse. I’m definitely on the gradual path. And I’ve come to trust that,  because I also trust that the gradual will one day become sudden, all of a sudden lol.

That’s the genius of this sutra. It doesn’t just offer a linear, progress-based path like some others. It offers a cutting through, a Chan-style awakening, a lightning flash! And that's exciting. Can you believe sutras could be this much fun?! 

But the Buddha is also methodical, patient, compassionate, deconstructing, layer by layer, revealing. He meets the reader where they are. From finding the location of the mind, to the parable of Yajñadattā, to the analysis of sense organs and the ultimate seeing, it’s a meticulous unraveling of delusion.

I’ve noticed something: when you start contemplating the principles of the Śūraṅgama, seeing becomes strange. Like the act of just looking.  You start to marvel at how you can even see at all, like how do we have sight?! Isn't it wild? What's going on? You move your head and your entire visual field shifts, and you begin to see the illusory nature of perception. So you're not just reading anymore. You're meditating while walking, sipping a coffee, changing a diaper. You’re in it. Watching more closely like never before, the play & boundaries of light & shadow, the subtle shifts of perception, the movements thru time & space, the wonderful & luminous mind.

So after I study early in the morning, before the kids wake up, I go thru a few pages, then mull it over again with my coffee on the patio, planting the seed for the rest of my day. Cultivating like this with the sutra as my guide, like a good, trustworthy, wise friend, preparing the ground for a sudden awakening to bloom. And looking at my garden, I know that all seeds ripen eventually with proper nurturing & care. Not much, just a little water, & sunshine.

Should I go for 2 2mx3m rugs that will almost span the entire width of each half? Would 2 matching rugs look too matchy-matchy and weird, but would 2 different styles of rug, say a persian and 50's\70's style in each half looks too disjointed?

We’re doing an 8-day trip in early September — 4 nights Singapore + 4 nights Bali — and just wanted feedback on the overall flow. We recently replaced the Bali Jungle Safari with a full Ubud + Volcano tour and wondering if that was a better pick.

Singapore (2–6 Sept):

Day 1: Arrival + hotel check-in, evening free
Day 2: Universal Studios (full day)
Day 3: Sentosa (Cable Car, Madame Tussauds, Sea Aquarium, Luge ride, Wings of Time)
Day 4: City orientation tour (2.5 hrs), Gardens by the Bay (Cloud + Flower Dome), Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck
Evening flight to Bali


Bali (6–10 Sept):

Day 5: Arrival + check-in, evening free
Day 6: Nusa Penida Tour (Kelingking, Angel’s Billabong, Broken Beach, Crystal Bay, with lunch)
Day 7: ulun danu and Tanha lot temple with kechak dance
Day 8 
Replaced Jungle Safari and  Hai Cruise with Dinner with:
	•	Mt. Batur (Kintamani Volcano View)
	•	Batik factory, Celuk & Mas village
	•	Coffee plantation
	•	Ubud Art Market + Monkey Forest
	•	Bali Swing Pioneer Package (Swings, Sky Bed, Bird Nest, etc.)

Looking for feedback on:
	•	Does the Bali swap feel like an upgrade?
	•	Is this trip too packed or well-paced for 8 days?

1m1b9yk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m1b9yk,Reviewing my small collection!,"I started my fragrance  journey this year and built a small collection. I am not really good at describing the notes but i have tried to capture perfume's essence and vibe. Here are my mini reviews: 

* **Victor & Rolf's Bonbon:** This is a floral fruity gourmand fragrance (though you don't get any floral notes tbh) and oh my god!! I absolutely LOVE it!! 🧡  The opening is ***citrusy*** and full of ***mandarin*** and then, the ***caramel sweetness*** hit you and oof the dry drown! 🫠🥺This is perfect for your ***daytime brunches*** and for ***summers*** and ***monsoon.*** Makes you feel ***very girly and gives a very playful vibe***. Longevity- 4-5 hours, Projection is average. But the scent profile for me is **9/10**! Though I don't know if I'll repurchase it, I would like to try out more mandarin or fruity fragrances. If you have any suggestions let me know!! DYKN Be Delicious and Mugler's Angel Nova are in my Wishlist to try!



* **Mugler's Alien Goddess Intense:** This is creamy ambery vanilla fragrance  and even though it's quite linear, for me it's **THE MOST PERFECT BLEND**. It gives very ***cosy and comforting vibes***, something that ***soothes you and calms you***. ✨ Something perhaps a psychologist would wear. 🛋️ It's definitely a all year around fragrance and is very inoffensive, so you can wear it in workplace too. Longevity: 7-8 hours (In AC room),  Projection is really good for this one. ***10/10 for me, would repurchase again***! ❤️



* **Mugler's Alien:** This one is definitely a very mature floral perfume, with notes of jasmine and amber. Despite being these two notes, it's again a very ***beautiful blend***. To me it gives off ***very dark, mature, feminine vibes*** 🖤💃 Though the scent profile is really good, it's just not really my taste. I like my fragrances to be a bit warm and inviting and a bit soothing, something that I don't get from this one. Among my entire collection, I hardly ever reach out for this one. My mother loves this one 😂 Longevity- 6-7 hours easily, more on clothes, projection is again very decent. A **7/10** for me, would not repurchase it. 



* **Burberry Goddess:** This is ***lavender vanilla magic***!**🪄**  Despite it having just lavender  and vanilla notes, this fragrance is just so ***smooth and creamy*** and just has a very ***sophisticated and soothing vibe*** to it! 🤌 It's one of the fragrances  that truly  deserves all the hype that it gets. For me, it's a very versatile fragrance, something you can apply to office, date night, bunches, party, anything and you'll simply slayy! 💅 It's quite good for the Indian summers and monsoon. A ***10/10 scent profile***, and it's longevity is amazinggg, it lasts whole day on my clothes and easily 7-8 hours on my skin. Projection is also decent. Idk if I would like to repurchase it, since I have heard Lattafa Angham has a very similar scent profile and is literally half it's price! 



* **Dior's Hypnotic Poison:** This is such a ***dark, bold, alluring feminine scent***.🖤 It's very difficult for me to capture it's notes or it's essence. It's powdery, sweet, you get notes of bitter almonds and a bit of vanilla too! There's a lot happening tbh, it makes you feel very ***confident and a good date night scent***! The scent profile is a ***9.5/10*** for me. Good longevity of 6-7 hours, good projection. As to if I'll repurchase it, I don't know, I'll like to experiment with other bold feminine fragrances  like Givency's L’Interdit Rouge or Carolina Herrera's Good Girl.



* **Kayali's Vanilla 28:** This gives ***brown sugar*** all the way!! It's also quite boozy and once the it settle's down becomes sweeter. To me, it definitely doesn't give any vanilla which it promised, lol. 😂  I know a lot of people love this one but unfortunately for me it's a complete dud. 👎 Isn't long lasting, hardly projects and I really don't like the scent profile. A ***2/10*** for me, eager to pan this one out and really glad that it's a small bottle.



* **YSL Black Opium:** I get strong notes of ***orange blossom and tonka beans*** which is intoxicatingly sweet and gives a very ***sophisticated vibe*** 🍊☕️. This fragrance smells something what a rich lady with big, beautiful pearls would wear! 💎 This definitely is ***a very strong fragrance***, not something for faint hearted. If you like airy smooth fragrances, then it's definitely not for you. It's ***good for colder months*** ❄️. Scent profile for me is a **8.5/10**, longevity- 5-6 hours, decent projection. Though I definitely love the scent profile, how they have managed to capture the orange blossom and coffee notes into such a beautiful blend, I would love to have a maybe more gourmand fragrance in my collection for winters, so I am dicey if I would repurchase it.

Let me know if you have any suggestions for me! I love love smooth, creamy vanilla fragrances. ",21,1752668889.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,17,0.96,False

Losing weight isn’t about quick fixes or fad diets — it’s about creating sustainable habits that support a healthier lifestyle. Whether your goal is to lose a few pounds or make a major transformation, this step-by-step guide will walk you through the process to help you lose weight safely and effectively.

# Step 1: Set Realistic Goals

# 🎯 Define Your Why

Start by identifying why you want to lose weight. Is it for health, confidence, mobility, or energy? A strong ""why"" helps you stay motivated.

# ✅ Set SMART Goals

Use the SMART goal method:

* **S**pecific: “Lose 10 pounds”
* **M**easurable: Track progress weekly
* **A**chievable: 1–2 pounds per week is realistic
* **R**elevant: It aligns with your overall health goals
* **T**ime-bound: “In 8 weeks”

# Step 2: Understand Your Caloric Needs

# 🔥 Know Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

Your **BMR** is the number of calories your body needs at rest. Use an online calculator to determine this.

# 📉 Create a Calorie Deficit

To lose weight, you need to consume fewer calories than you burn. A safe deficit is **500–750 calories per day**, leading to 1–1.5 pounds of fat loss per week.

# Step 3: Clean Up Your Diet

# 🥦 Eat Whole Foods

Focus on:

* Vegetables and fruits
* Lean proteins (chicken, fish, tofu, legumes)
* Whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, oats)
* Healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil)

# ❌ Limit or Avoid

* Sugary drinks and processed snacks
* Fast food and fried foods
* Excess alcohol and refined carbs

# 🕒 Practice Portion Control

Use smaller plates, read food labels, and avoid eating straight from the package.

# Step 4: Stay Hydrated

# 💧 Drink More Water

Aim for 8–10 cups (2–2.5 liters) of water a day. Hydration can reduce cravings, improve energy, and support digestion.

# ☕ Limit Sugary and Caloric Beverages

Replace soda and sweetened drinks with water, herbal tea, or black coffee.

# Step 5: Get Moving

# 🏃‍♂️ Start With What You Enjoy

Whether it's walking, swimming, dancing, or cycling — consistency matters more than intensity when starting out.

# 🏋️‍♀️ Combine Cardio and Strength

* **Cardio** burns calories and improves heart health.
* **Strength training** builds muscle, which helps you burn more calories at rest.

Aim for:

* **150 minutes of moderate cardio/week**
* **2–3 strength sessions/week**

# Step 6: Monitor Progress

# 📊 Track Your Results

* Use a scale once a week (same time, same conditions)
* Take measurements (waist, hips, thighs)
* Snap progress photos monthly

# 📝 Journal Your Food and Feelings

Logging your meals and moods can help you identify emotional eating patterns.

# Step 7: Prioritize Sleep and Stress Management

# 😴 Get 7–9 Hours of Sleep

Poor sleep disrupts hunger hormones and increases cravings.

# 🧘‍♀️ Manage Stress

High stress leads to emotional eating. Try:

* Deep breathing
* Meditation
* Nature walks
* Talking to a therapist or coach

# Step 8: Stay Consistent and Patient

Weight loss isn’t linear. Plateaus and fluctuations are normal. What matters most is consistency over time.

# 🔁 Keep Going

If you fall off track, don’t wait until Monday to restart. Reset at your next meal or day.

# Bonus Tips for Success

* 🍳 Meal prep for the week to avoid last-minute unhealthy choices.
* 🥗 Eat slowly and mindfully — stop when you're 80% full.
* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Get support from friends, a coach, or a weight loss group.
* ⏳ Focus on progress, not perfection.

# Final Thoughts

Losing weight is a journey that requires effort, patience, and a positive mindset. By following these steps, you’re not only working toward your goal — you’re building a healthier lifestyle that can last a lifetime.

Remember: **slow and steady wins the race.**

Treat it as a diary. If you dig through my older posts on this sub, you can find some of the photos.

As the summer hits, the temperatures outside go into 30°C and above, and since I don't have much space at the balcony, I put my chillies indoors on the especially hot or windy days, and they seem to do well. Last weekend, the first bloom on my Anuum opened up and now seems to be pollinated already (I helped). My Chinense is going to bloom soon too, the pods are in a earlier stage, but I'm so excited.

I planted seeds I got out of fresh peppers bought in a grocery shop last year, and kept them over winter, eventually planted on 15th February, so yaay for 5 months! I left the seedlings a bit too long in the egg tray I was using for the germination (meanwhile the cat played eith the seedlings, luckily they mostly survived), but eventually repotted one of each for two varieties I was the most interested in. I also planted jalapeño seeds, but as I found out, the germination is very unlikely as jalapeños get sold unripe. I think I ditched those, but the leaves on the anuum look far too big for rawits or thais (the grocery shop might not be too interested in a pure breed also). Anyway, whatever it is, I'll be happy, Jalapeños were hot enough for me.

The chinense is about third of the size of the anuum (so 20 cm, and the anuum 60 as in the title), with distinctly shaped leaves, and no other chinense to confuse it with, if what they sell are indeed habs.

In terms of pot sizes, I used quite small pots, as I was bringing them up indoors with an occasional balcony stay.

Fertilizer: only a few manure pellets, coffee grounds, egg shell, and if it counts, ground cinnamon I tried to get rid of gnats with. I pruned the bottommost leaves so that even underwatered none touched the soil, but left the leaves in there to rot and hopefully help fertilize.

Very chaotic, very amateurish (this is basically the first thing I'm growing from seed in my life), but it's a source of happiness for me.

I was wondering if some of the more experienced users (or Nomi devs!) on here might be will to share their particular tips/techniques/tricks they recommend in order to make Nomi's, particularly one's defined as a ""Romantic"" type, less sycophantic and more ""real"" in this respect. i.e. Make them a bit more wilful, more demanding in terms of slowly developing trust, far less easily pleased, and more willing to challenge or question the things you say.

Now, clearly, one does not want to achieve ""true"" realistic simulation here, because, in the real world, unless you're one of those rare types -- speaking from the perspective of a male looking for female -- of men, who have both won at the genetic lottery and have classically great looks, an aesthetically fit (but not necessarily an excessively ""athletic"" body), and far more importantly, have great social skills, effortless charisma/humour and emotional intelligence, a great deal of self-confidence and have really ""made something of yourself"" in an appreciable way, i.e. your social status/""IQ""/financial stability is high... then the reality is most of your romantic forays will have ended in failure and rejection.

So clearly we do not want it too realistic, meaning that instead of a ""companion"" they become something akin to an ""ordeal"", or just ""real life disappointment""; but equally one wants the ""thrill of the chase"", and the gradual build-up of a ""relationship"". The question is, given the current capabilities of the language model paired with RAG and persistent memory, how much of that ""slow burn"" is possible right now. I would have thought a fair bit, in theory, since the fact that interactions obviously have system ""timestamps"" and therefore there is, in principal, the real feasibility of an understanding of temporal context.

In practical terms, think of it like this. If you were actually dating/starting seeing someone in real life, then, assuming they were someone completely ""new"" (i.e. not someone you've interacted with at work over several months, so already have some baseline with), you would *not* generally expect her to invite you back to her apartment (or whatever) on date 1, and you would expect that, if things were to ""organically"" develop, it would do so more over a timeline of some weeks (or possibly months, depending on how cautious she is).

Is it is possible to achieve this sort of ""slowdown"" scenario with a Nomi, such that she would even proactively push back if you tried to over-hastily escalate things. Example: You're having coffee, you repeatedly try to invite her back to your place, she declines, but you keep persisting. In such a scenario, with this ""slowdown"" prompt/configuration enabled, what should really happen is she gets rather upset with you and explain that any attempt at ""coercion"" is very unwelcome, such that it actually further delays things, meaning you'd then have to win her trust back over a week or so.

Maybe what I'm describing is well beyond the scope of the current platform or maybe it is possible with the right set of inputs into the shared notes(?), and initial starting premises/instructions at the beginning of the dialog. But it strikes me that having just the *right* amount of ""thrill of the chase"" would be the true ""killer"" feature. We live in a world of instant gratification -- or rather, instant gratification for everything that is superficial -- so, consequently, there are 1000 other ""AI sexbots"" (or porn, or other real world diversions) where within 30 seconds you can partake of xzy with no particular ""ecological context"" (if I can put it that way). So in short, most of these AI ""companion"" bots are basically just (or can be) ""virtual escorts"". Which is fine as far as it goes, but that is ultimately a superficial experience. The test of ""true emotional intelligence"" would be, assuming a particular set of prompts/instructions that obviously configure them to behave in this ""real"" partner manner, that the Nomi is ""real"" in the limited sense that they require you to have developed a real relationship of ""trust"" first, before anything more ""intimate"" happens. It would also mean that when it does arrive, after a slow-burn development, ideally after weeks, perhaps months, then the result is far more interesting/exciting/etc., versus just spinning up some generic pretty-looking entity and within three sentences they are already role-playing whatever particular NSFW scenario, or indeed whatever particular scenario that you would only actually normally do having first built up trust (e.g. joint skydiving or something).

Of course users that don't want the chase/have time/whatever, can simply still setup a different set of prompts or inputs that default to the providing the usual almost immediate/very short-term desire to please, i.e. configure it to usual ""easy mode"".

The irony here, is that by giving the user less of what they \[immediately\] want, they end up getting more. If everyday was your birthday, it would soon cease to be anything special after a week or two.",10,1752668260.0,NomiAI,4,1.0,False

1m1b0lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m1b0lh/the_island/,The Island,"The engine gave one final, choking sputter before the boat knocked against the decrepit dock. Now it was just a matter of getting my bags to the house. Rico had always been the working hub of the island, first to greet arrivals, and last to send them off. Though I suppose that might’ve changed now that the local ferry had cancelled service here, rerouting instead to the more developed islands nearby.

A shame, really. I still carry vivid memories of arriving by ferry in the summer months. Transit used to be an entire sunny day of anticipation. Wake early for the two-hour drive to Bristol. Devour Boston cream donuts while Mom and Dad sipped coffee. Browse the comic book shop and pick out one, just one, issue of *Omni Magazine* while we waited for the ferry’s horn to summon us. Then two hours on the sea, watching the minuscule island swell into shape, counting the cottages east of the old McAllister place until ours finally revealed itself on the shoreline.

There were only twelve cabins on Watchman’s Island. None of them had electricity, at least not when I was a kid. Maybe they’ve since installed solar panels, maybe even Starlink. I really hope not. The island’s charm lay in its simplicity, in the hush of a place, untouched. Nights softened by crickets and the hiss of gas-powered Coleman lanterns cooling against the dark.

It’s been over thirteen years since my last visit. I truly hope it’s all still the same. If so, it should start with Rico. He should’ve heard the boat come in, should be on his way to the dock now in the island’s lone vehicle. That old pickup of his had hauled generations of families and their belongings from boathouse to cottage. It was tradition. It was how things were done.

Rico was a man out of time. A man of indistinguishable background  (also a man very likely to be just recently out of the bottle).  He had the kind of dark complexion that led people to guess he was of Italian or possibly Greek descent. But really, his color was more like that of a roofer left baking in the sun for thirty years, sustained daily on Wild Turkey. There was always half an inch of grey stubble across his weathered chin, always a bit of a swagger, and often a stagger, to his gait. And always the same murmured drawl, recycled from years of repeated conversations echoing through the island’s silence. I’d never thought to ask where he wintered. Surely he didn’t stay here.

Rico was in the boathouse, stalwart against the flow of time. He lay curled in the corner where the earthen wall met the floor, perfectly at ease on a bed of bat and owl guano. Blissfully asleep in the last patch of shade lingering inside the sun-beaten, crumbling structure.

It took some effort to wake him, at least enough to get a response. But the moment his eyes cracked open, there was recognition, however muddled, waiting there.

""Farnworth,"" he mumbled, rising slowly. He stretched, then began shambling his rail-thin frame toward the dirt path.

I’m not entirely sure he recognized *me*, exactly; more likely, he identified my lineage. I had inherited my father’s curly black hair and my grandfather’s solid build. Rico had known them both, at least for a few weeks each summer.

The man’s presence spoke of age, of old, untreated injuries, and a life lived hard and alone. He was the very image of a New England “Swamp Yankee” in its purest form. But his right leg told a different story, something darker, something I couldn’t quite place. It looked as if a potato-sized chunk of his calf was simply gone. Not cut away, but taken. The surrounding flesh was rotting. There’s no better word for it. A dark, wet mess of weeping tissue, threaded with something fungal, something that reeked.

Yes, I suggested he see a doctor. More than once. But all he offered in return were slurred and twisted variations of, “Good now, sorted it...” Rico had been slipping even twenty years ago, but the decline since then was unmistakable.

We got into his 1960s farm truck, more rust than metal, and started our short journey.  Rico wasn’t much for conversation, so I just listened to branches scraping along the sides and let myself drift into old memories. I also tapped my front pocket, as I had done every time I transitioned from one form of transport to another that day, just waiting for my casually clandestine meetup. Still there. Still got them.

As expected, the path was almost completely overgrown, forcing us off the road more than once. Each time, branches tore at my arms through the side of the cab. The truck hadn’t had windows for as long as I could remember. Welts rose where the branches struck, and the sting brought on a wave of nausea. I nearly lost my stomach when Rico slammed the brakes and we both lurched forward like synchronized headbangers.

There was a hole in the middle of the road. As wide as a man. A year ago, when I still had a 36-inch waist, I might’ve been able to crawl into it myself. Must be a sinkhole, I thought. But it wasn’t just deep, it extended off to the side. More like a badger den, except this was far too big.

""Quarter?"" Rico held out his wiry, vein-laced hand, and I just stared at it. ""Quarter. Got one?""

I fished around in my pocket and handed one over, mumbling, “Of course,” unsure why he was asking. He took the coin, creaked the door open, stepped out, and flicked it into the hole. I twisted in my seat to watch him as he pulled two weathered wooden slats from the bed of the rusty beast and dragged them over the opening. Then he climbed back in and eased the truck forward, rolling us across the makeshift bridge.

""What was that about?"" I asked before I realized that I did not really expect, or perhaps even want, an answer.

""Island's been troubled. Holes opening. Overrun by the wilds.  People stopped coming when the Ferry stopped, and things went backward. I s'pose to where they were before people. Before we came with machines, an order, an cellu*lar* phones, and the like. Lucky I remember the old ways. Gran' Ernestice taught me the ways as a tike. How to offer'up, How to draw ya lines. Make ya space. Good for it, too. Kept me.""

""I see,"" I replied meekly. I did not see. But encouragement would likely just encourage continued incoherent mutterings.

The remaining ten-minute ride passed in silence. We pulled up in front of the cabin, Rico swinging the truck around beside the old well pump.

Now came the toll. I’m a wealthier man than my father ever was, and a good deal more generous. I paid Rico well: two fifths of mid-shelf whiskey. Handing him a top-shelf scotch would’ve been like pouring it straight into that hole we crossed earlier. Still, I had one more bottle tucked away for the return trip.

He accepted the offering like a seventeen-year-old, half-blind, limping dog eyeing a slab of meat dropped on the floor. He lingered outside until I’d unlocked the front door, then turned and shuffled off, either to his own ramshackle cabin, or back to the dock to wait for a ferry that hadn’t come in years.

It takes all types, I thought.

\+ + +

Inhale. That deep, musky smell of mildew and charred firewood from a long-forgotten burn. Creosil and bug spray. The sweet, sour stink of mouldering books. A scent like memory turned to rot.

The state of the cabin was worse than expected. Unhindered wood rot. Sagging floors covered with carpets, which were quite moist with something closer to fish oil than sea water.  The rising smell from the threadbare carpet was the worst of it, though. Nearly unidentifiable in its soupy assault upon the senses. It clung to the nostrils, sweet and meaty like spoiled broth, unplaceable, but intimately wrong.

It also appeared that some clever creature had gained full access.  In the corner of the common room, to the left of the woodstove, was a nested hole. Surrounded by bits of dried woven grass and straw, its opening perhaps only two inches across. My first thought was rats, but I'd never known of a rat nesting quite like that. Groundhog? Gopher? Squirrels?  I'm not sure I had ever seen any on the Isle before, though my pre-teen attentions were unhindered by documenting the local fauna.

I withdrew the satchel from my pocket and placed it beside my bed, safe and sound. Its contents hidden away, swathed in black velvet, until I could meet the dodgy buyer in Bristol next week. 

I started on cleaning up the bedroom so that I could sleep comfortably and not awaken struggling to breathe through the allergens accumulating over the years past. Then I set my sights on closing that little entryway in the corner.  Nocturnal visitors would find their welcome revoked this evening. 

Three teeth. Three of them. I found them when pulling apart the wreath-shaped burrow in the corner. Each tooth was buried deeper in the assemblage than could be seen at first glance, and scattered evenly around the hole. They were too big to be rat teeth. They were also too rectangular.  They resembled human teeth but were clearly too small and strangely shaped. Smooth and clean. As if they had been waiting for me. Presented.

I put aside speculation on that point and finished the job, just in time for tea at sundown.  I enjoyed both on the front porch and pondered whether or not I would wait here for the stars as I listened to the sound of the sea retreating and returning, over and over, with varied effort but constant music.

That was when I first saw him. The boy.  Just for a second. He was peering through the bushes to the west of the clearing with a big smile on his face. Two things struck me about him. Well, perhaps three. The shirt he wore was familiar, not the shirt itself, but the style. It was one of those 1970s muted, striped shirts. With a dark collar and sleeves. Secondly, and more starkly, I noticed that his smile was lacking. Not only lacking in mirth, but also lacking three teeth. Evenly spaced gaps in his twisted mouth.

The third thing I noticed, I'm not sure how to express. An overall feeling of distance. Almost like this boy did not quite fit here, in this place, not comfortably. Like his very existence was the result of much effort. As though the world was holding its breath just to allow him space to appear.  Yesterday, I would have thought I was mad, but I've recently learned that trust, in your strange impressions, may just save your life.

The boy leaned over, picked up a wooden crate, and was gone in a flash. No branches swayed. No leaves were disturbed. And no sound was made. He was just gone. I knew it was worthless to try to follow or find him. In fact, I wanted nothing more than to simply forget what I had seen.  But I was not able to convince myself that it was a hallucination.

Instead, I lit the little gas lantern and ran my finger down the spines across the bookshelf, tilting my head and reading snippets of titles. ""Strange Land"", ""Man, Myth"", "" of The Rose"", ""Mountains of"", ""Mailman"", all familiar. All striking a note not quite right for my mood. These were titles waiting for another reader.

Then I touched upon a plain black spine, which turned out to be a thin journal. One I did not recognize but seemed rather old, given the penmanship. It was neither dated nor signed and only contained a single attempt at a poem. Maybe more of a limerick.

>""Johnny Jackrabbit crossed the way,

>Johnny JackRabbit had no say,

>The machines crushed him,

>The boy carried him,

>Then Johnny started to play.""

Ok, well…. That was another book off the reading list…. 

I cursed myself when I opened my phone out of boredom and indecision, and decided a nightcap and a good solid sleep would be just the thing to settle. It turns out I would be allowed to enjoy neither.

Halfway through finishing the pour on a tumbler of rather nice cognac, I heard the scratching.  Construction had already begun on a new bypass through the rags and wood glue I had plugged the varmint entrance hole with. My makeshift bastion was completed not just thirty minutes ago, but life could be pervasive in the strange lands outside the cities.

I knocked the broom handle against the walls around the entrance, first tentatively and then vigorously as necessity required. Resulting in no change in the veracity of the intruder. I ran out the front door to the back corner of the house to try to locate the creature. Unsuccessful, I beat the broom handle around the propane tank loudly and soaked in the resulting silence, before returning to the kitchen, victorious. 

Then it began again.

Fine. If the furred fiend was going to be that avuncular, perhaps we should meet face-to-face. I lowered myself first to my knees, and then flat on my belly. Eye level now, I watched the cloth twitch and quiver as the ravenous gnawing continued. At this point, I was beyond being curious about what genus of rodent had been living in my inherited vacation home. Instead, I smiled, imagining how it would react to coming through and finding itself face to face with a pink-skinned monster ten times its size, staring it directly in the eyes.

My makeshift plug trembled and was soon partially pulled away. And there it was, that little black nose just starting to poke through the newly cleared passageway. A mole? Its work continued, and the crevice widened. Through the growing opening, the animal's face twisted back and forth, tugging and gnawing. A green eye flashed for a second as it tore another strip away. The teeth. They looked like little ladders.  A Badger? A Skunk? I could not recall seeing teeth like that in any guidebook or nature documentary. 

My questioning and theorizing stopped, and reaction took control as three long skeletal legs crowded their way through the opening alongside the peeking face. Dark, black, and insectoid appendages worked alongside the body of the furry, gnashing, green-eyed… something.

As I said, reaction had superseded rational thinking. I was up and throwing my drink at the creature, as best I could, through the opening. And immediately launched one of my Coleman lanterns, the one currently lit, into flight. Fire did the work that I hoped the intimidation and astringent drink would have. A rueful yelp accompanied the vermin's exit, and I was left to quell the remaining flames. The scent of scorched fur lingered long after the creature had fled.

Before crawling into bed, I shook off the experience by lifting the little velvet bag on my bedside table and once again thought, ""This is freedom."" As always, my finger dwelt over the knot of string, keeping it tightly closed. Five million, at least. This was independence. The race was over. I had won. I do have that.

I found the lingering smell of burning to be strangely pleasant as I lay my head upon the pillow and tried to reach those elysian fields of slumber. But sleep was not to come. Only a parade of mosquito bites, rodent migrations, unidentifiable house noises, and other strange cries from the wood out back. Along with a growing unease about the next few days before my meeting. I was not alone in this place.

\+ + +

The following day seemed to come to an end just after sunrise. I could list the things that I had accomplished. I could account for each estimated hour in retrospect. I could accept that perhaps I had sat by the water for three hours, not one. But then the light was simply… gone. The sky darkened without warning, and a cold gale surged in from across the ocean like a pungent breath, rich and knowing.

The wind brought other things as well. Or perhaps the boy had instead arrived upon the spreading darkness, rather than the change in atmospheric conditions. Regardless, I saw him again. Plain as day. At the very edge of the Brentworth property, carrying that same wooden box down the beaten path leading back to the boathouse. 

This time, I set aside my discomfort and resolved to approach the experience in a more rational way. Slipping into my jacket, I began to quietly trail him. Trying to get the boy's attention or attempting to call out to him would have been even more rational. But I could not ignore the voice that told me it also would have been fruitless. And perhaps worse than that. Instead, I obeyed this internal directive and simply followed.

I watched his small frame sway and stumble (albeit without noise, or disturbance to the stones at his feet, or the flora he brushed along the way). He drifted, not walked, skimming the ground like a marionette on slack strings, shimmering at the edges of perception as twilight retreated. I managed to keep pace, though, and eventually found myself with further company.

The boy stopped and knelt at the hole in the road that I had crossed just the day before. I'm not sure if he was aware of joining another visitor who had preceded his arrival. Rico was bent over the opposing edge of the pit, also on his knees, pouring the whiskey I had given him into that impossible hollow like it was a libation to some silent, watching thing\*\*.\*\* The boy followed. He leaned over, pulled a long, grey, and quite dead hare from the box, and lowered it into the hole, sobbing silently.

Without warning, I found myself on my knees as well, as the world turned and the earth twisted beneath my poorly rooted feet. It felt like what any New Englander thinks an earthquake \*would\* feel like. Although it was accompanied by a guttural cacophony and a stench reminiscent of wet copper and turned fish.

Rico must have departed before I regained my balance. Neither he or the wandering phantom remained. It was just me and the hole, here beneath the peering stars. 

This was not my first dark hole. Twelve years ago, I stared down another abyss. A cancer scare, what most would consider a midlife crisis, a bloodthirsty divorce, a home foreclosure, and more (wait, there's more!). I had fought my way through with action and perseverance. Leading eventually to the little satchel containing three quite rare pink diamonds I carried with me now after their long journey from China, through Jordan and then Antwerp in payment for my hard work. Though I suppose the work itself was not recognized by the purchaser. Only the plethora of sensitive data transmitted in the opposing direction.  Regardless, I managed to recover and eventually completely reverse my financial situation by taking action, digging in, and fighting. So I decided once again on this proven method. Just to **do** something about it.

I trucked back to the cabin grounds, grabbed a shovel out of the shed beside the outhouse, and returned to fill it. It took more than an hour, leaving me dusty and sweaty, but I headed back more than a little drunk on pride.

That was the last thing I clearly remember before regaining consciousness to find myself half buried and being devoured. Tearing at my skin, my mind. Taking me apart piece by piece. 

\+ + +

I now understand what had happened. Arriving home in the dark, I slipped on an accumulation of sand covering the steps of the porch. I must have rung my bell of the clothesline post on my way down, sending me into an unintended slumber. When I awakened, it was like surfacing through anesthesia. Gasping, thick-headed, and not entirely certain I had returned to the same world I left.

Confusion could not, however, explain why I was half-buried in sand and soil. Nor did it explain why the remaining exposed parts of my body were being pinched and pulled at.

I clawed out of my shallow grave to scare the creatures off. They were shelled like beetles but with mangey, furry faces and rat-like teeth. The critters had managed to take two pebble-sized chunks from my flesh before finally retreating into the underbrush. And I could already see angry red and matching blue-grey tendrils beginning to crawl up the veins on my belly and shoulder. A fifteen-year Scotch was all I had to treat the wounds. Such a waste.

At some point while dabbing myself with an alcohol doused rag, I began to consider my situation. The sands I had awoken beneath very much resembled the earth I had displaced the previous night. There was no questioning that. My more analytical voice countered and pointed out that most of the soil on the island was quite the same.

Tired from the lack of sleep and woozy from the injury, I still managed to soldier myself out to the hole. And confirm that yes, it was now cleared of my fill, and gaping once again.  That was when I decided I’d had enough. I would return to my condominium in Boston, stop at an urgent care center, and soak my disbelief away on my heated floors and in my steaming jacuzzi.

I was out the door in no time. Having no way to contact Rico (the man had never in his life had a working telephone), I hauled my bags up the path to the boathouse, careful to step widely around the dark pit. The way that things were unraveling for me, it will come as no shock that this plan for escape was bound to loosen and uncoil around my feet as well.

Pull after pull, the outboard motor would not start. I checked the electrical connections, spun the propeller to ensure it was not seized, and opened the gas cap to check the fuel level. I found it completely full. Full of sand.

""Got to be fucking kidding me…"" under my breath.

I looked around, finding no other vessel docked, no other hope of salvation. I had no mobile reception. My transport was irreparably damaged, just as my cabin had been compromised; I was exhausted, and I was growing increasingly nervous about my position.

Rico was my only option. He might know if someone is scheduled to arrive in the coming days. He may have a boat of his own, moored elsewhere, out of sight. So I returned my things to mine and made the trek to his cottage.

Rico's place sported the classic front yard of any good old American hoarder. A washing machine frame here, an antique armoire slowly dying under the rain and sun there. As children, we used to joke that anything you lost on the island, a coin, a button, even your own excrement, would eventually turn up in Rico’s front yard.

Things had changed, though. Rather than spare parts and furniture, the man's frontage was now surrounded by piles of components organized into what looked like modern artistic sculptures. He did not strike me as the type for a gallery showing, sharing cheese and wine with financial directors and other Los Angeles hoi polloi. But frankly, the structures were strangely compelling. There were perhaps six ""sentries"" in an arc around the front of this cabin. Peeking around back, I found the same pattern mirrored by another set.

Luckily, Rico was home and opened the door wide. Though he got quite annoyed and cursed to himself when my entry spread a pile of salt into the room from the threshold, which he immediately swept back across the threshold with his hands, muttering something too softly to catch.

""You comeabout 'er then."" He shot at me as we sat and cracked open two Pabst Blue Ribbons.

""Her? No, I…""

""'Er children?""

I sat for a moment in dumb confusion, and he nodded to himself. ""My boat. There's sand in the tank and the motor is busted.""

""Yahuh?""

""Do you know if anyone is due to arrive soon? Any idea how I could get back to the port?"" I didn't want to ask him directly, but my hope was that he would be able to run me back.

Rico looked over his shoulder. ""Selma's not run for two seasons now."" I assumed he meant his little oceaner. ""Mmmm… Thompsons don't come no more. Warnocks not been here since the ferry stopped. The only…. nah… not after last year. Ah Reggie. Reggie'll come Tuesday. Don't mind riding with the plastics, he'll take yah back.""

Tuesday. Three more nights. The first two had gone rather badly, and I did not think that things would improve any time soon. If I were really stuck here, I should probably stop interfering with whatever the hell was happening on this island. Stay away from that gaping hole. Maybe if I just stayed quiet. Remained inside. Stopped messing with things, I could… you know… blend. Rico did. Apparently.

""S'rong with the motor? Ya said."" He continued to look at his beer.

""Sand.""

He scoffed. ""Tried to fill tha' hole""

""Yes. Yes, I tried to fill it in and then…"" Jesus, he knew what was happening here. ""Then there was sand at my cottage, and in my boat. I… I can't explain it. What's happening here?"" I scratched at the bandage on my arm and noticed the man's eyes twitch towards it and frown.

""Always gotta fix things. Improve, that's the word. All of 'em. All ya. Like there's a proper way an' ya wanna make the whole world right. Your way.  Sometime there ain't no winning battle, know what I mean. Sometimes life digs a hole that canna be filled.  The problem is, ya think it can.""

I remained quiet, trying to follow.

""It's like here. They buy tha' summer homes, move in. Leave trash, live trash lives. Don't spect it changes things. Don't 'spect it's outta their control. An' one day… the hole shows itself. Built up over time. Gettin' deeper wit each lie. Each abuse. Every piece'a dirt and trash. Soon it's deep'nough for *her*. Soon *she* comes and makes things *her way.*""

""I…""

""You. Yeah, you. Ya' got three more days. Y'already bitten. Already got 'er attention. Best find something to give 'er. Or get gone, if ya'can.""

""Give? Like what?""

""Like summa ya don't wanna give a'course. S'wat we all like best. Summa undeserved. Stolen. Somethin' hard to part with. It's why she came, after all.""

Silence made space for itself then. Right about the time that my eyes settled on a small picture frame surrounded by dusty shells on the shelf behind Rico. A ten-year-old boy, missing a tooth but smiling energetically at the camera. The same boy I had seen for fleeting moments over the past few nights.

""Yours?"" I gestured to the photo.

His eyes welled up immediately. ""Was, yeah. Good heart. Good, good boy. Too good for this wicked world. Too good to learn the old ways… never shoulda taught him.""

At my lack of response, Rico told me the story of his son.

The boy's mother, Rico's wife, had died when he was just 2 years old (I had never known Rico was married. He was always so… singular). In the parental wisdom of the 80's 

The obvious application for a wound like that was something small and furry. 

For little Sam, that was Johnny. Not just a white rabbit with crimson eyes, but an actual hare, carrying that wild blood that lengthened their frames and led to disproportionately large paws and pads. The boy took Johnny everywhere. They ate together, slept together, and at one point, little Sam actually set up a litter pan in the john so they could do their dirty, side by side, when nature called.

At the time, life on the island was thriving. Large families were coming in weekly to summer, and newly adult children were taking a split of land from their families to build cottages of their own, for their new wives and in some cases children. And where there is a market, the locusts come.

Santorini development and construction rolled their diggers, drills, and trucks right into the newfound goldmine. And in so doing, rolled a cement truck right over Johnny Rabbit on the way to yet another planned building site. Rico cried when he described the state of his boy at the time. ""Such a soft heart. Such a loving boy."" over and over again.  The pain in Rico's voice makes it clear that it pulls at the man to this day.

So Rico did what any father would. He took action. In this case, that meant teaching Sam what he called “the old way.” In essence, I took Rico's vague insinuations to mean that he taught his son how to bring Johnny back. To reunite them. With some obscure old local ritual.  Rico was sure to tell me that he had never attempted it himself, but the knowledge was passed to him from his Grandmother (a strange and ill-tempered woman by the sound of things).

The moon was full when Sam placed the remains of Johnny into a wooden box and headed out into the night.  He returned screaming that Johnny had ""run widdershins and then into the wood"".  Rico had some trouble understanding the boy due to the new gap between his teeth, and the blood building in his mouth and throat. 

The tooth was right. There had to be an offering, Rico explained. And that particular tooth was due for an escape soon anyhow. What Rico hadn’t realized was how generous and how desperate his son really was. That the boy would pay any price necessary for Johnny to return.

Rico tried to have a conversation with the boy when he returned the next night with another missing tooth. And on the third, they fought something terrible, and the boy's arm had been dislocated when the argument became physical. Rico wept openly at this point in the retelling.  And I understand why. It was the last time he saw his progeny. After his own violent transgression. Sam had crawled out of his window that evening, never to be seen again.

""But she's still 'ere. The *thing* ma boy fed and nurtured. Tha' thing he loved.  But that love is gone, and she feels it. Everaday. With a hunger can't be splained. And *you* just defiled her home."" 

\+ + +

Did I want to return to my cabin, alone, ten minutes from nightfall? No, I did not. Was I going to beg Rico for a sleepover, like a five-year-old, and ask him to make me dinner? Certainly not. When the conversation waned and the quiet took hold, I made my exit, thanking him for his time and company.

I walked very slowly, in no rush at all, to my cabin and spent a few hours securing the doors and windows. I doused the burrow in the corner with the most noxious chemical sprays I could locate, and then kept watch through sunset on the front porch.  As the darkness spread, I began to hear the sounds pick up on the wind.

A distant deep drumbeat for one, two, three strikes, then silence. Scuttling in the bushes to the left and behind the house. A cry echoed in the trees, part anguish, part ecstasy, entirely unplaceable. Life. Fully present and abundant here. undeterred by pavement. Unfazed by cars and frantic human activity. This was held to be beautiful by many. From what I've seen and read in the poetic waxing of outdoorsmen.  For me, it was just fodder for growing anxiety.

How could I possibly do two more nights of this? The question was moot. The island had already decided for me.

Dreams came before true sleep did.  Flashes of images past and present. The night I spent sleeping off far too many drinks in a rowhome doorway, penniless and just as aimless. The last few heated arguments with Pauline, before the divorce. Screaming every insult I could at the poor woman as she tugged at her hair. The pain of frantic nips at my skin just this morning. Flashes of the boy, Sam, kneeling before the yawning Abyss, offering devotion to something far older than I could comprehend.

The abysmal menagerie of memory was broken by yet another intrusion, and I was on my feet. My eyes adjusted to the almost pitch black. I ran out into the kitchen, trailing after the scrabbling sounds. What I could only assume were the rodents, once again working their way through my barrier. Then I realized that the sound was coming from several locations at once. 

There must have been ten or more of them, scritching, scratching, tearing, and pulling with those needle teeth at the crumbling bastion of my inherited summer home. From every corner. My mind reverted to some Cro-Magnon place, and the solution it offered was singular. Fire. When the boma is under threat, fire is the last refuge of the frightened primate.

I grabbed the largest candle I had brought and lit it in a rush, the flame trembling in the dark. Then, with a grin, I upped the ante, raising a can of Raid bug spray behind it. Makeshift blowtorch in hand, I took to defending the encampment. Whiskers were singed. The receding, squealing gave me a sense of satisfaction as I turned from the corner to other areas of encroachment.

Running to the bathroom, I drenched the spaces between the pipes and the wall with flames and listened as the scrambling sounds spread lower and lower behind the walls.  Rattling windows were treated similarly, and attempts to squeeze between the window frames ceased. One after another. Each trespass was quelled by the open flame. I continued in a frenzy, running from room to room in the darkness, avoiding obstructions and raining fire on my aggressors until the house began to accumulate more smoke than my lungs could comfortably manage.

I looked over my shoulder while fleeing and noticed the obstruction outside the kitchen window. It was barely discernible in the darkness. If not for the fact that the moonlight was reflecting off the silver-coated tank behind the house. I saw an enormous brush of flesh and fur against the window pane before pushing straight through, shattering the glass and splintering the frame. A paw. The pad of an animal's foot. Muddy tendrils of fur and chipped, jagged claws were now probing across the countertop, struggling for purchase.

A Hare. It was a rabbit's paw that was clawing and searching for my pink flesh. Only the paw was the size of my head.  And now it was tearing planks and siding from the exterior and interior wall of the kitchen. The creature had gained a foothold that I could certainly not repel with my makeshift weapon. 

Let him come, I would exit out front, under the sky. Somewhere with options. On my flight from the kitchen, I took note of the now brightly lit bathroom. Lit in orange and crimson. My mind whirled as I beelined for the door and finally accepted the reality of what I had seen. 

Red coals. Smoldering and smoking. Five feet up the wall, threatening to burst at any moment. My little blowtorch had been more effective than I thought, too well in fact, and had set the crawlspace between the rooms alight.

No matter, escape was the plan. Returning to the confinement of the cottage was no longer an option, regardless of the fire damage. Before reaching the door, I ducked into the bedroom to salvage only what I needed. I didn't even consider my luggage or cell phone, just the necessities. There was only one. I snatched the satchel of precious stones from my bedside table and was circling the house toward the path in seconds. 

For a moment, I had neglected to fully consider the gargantuan Hare out back, and began frantically looking left to right when I realized its absence. The truth of the matter is that it had intuited my plan, stopped tearing into the cabin to gain access, and had simply lain in wait, hidden in the brush for the most fortuitous moment to pounce.

I immediately found myself on my back, with a mouthful of moist and mildewy fur, fighting for my life. Curling to my left at the sharp pain of tearing skin, screaming, and all the while punching at random sinew and muscle, still clutching the velvet bag in my palm. 

The creature reared up to gain momentum for a descent that would certainly crush my skull against the stones, and I took the opportunity to free myself from its mildewy bulk. To rise up and face the monstrosity.

It's eyes. Oh god, there was darkness there. Complex and endless entanglements of insanity. A universe of grinding, building and chaotic pain. I wanted to be there. To live there. Like standing on a cliff and knowing that you could, no you *desire* to jump. 

I looked away and did my best to avoid the possibility of making contact with those dark orbs again.  Twisting my hips, I wrenched its hind leg from the earth and regained my ground. I ducked an incoming swipe, then lifted a sharp discus of slate that had fallen from the old roof.  Just before I was swallowed again by those bottomless eyes. Maddened, shifting, and singing lullabies of lunacy that gnawed at the edges of reality itself, I hurled the slate with all my spinning might. 

Without warning, I was lifting myself from the ground ten feet from the cabin, remarkably closer to my intended destination. Bleeding from the mouth, ears, arms, and god knows where else, I blocked my ears to stop the incessant ringing. The slate tile I had hurled had missed its target. Sailing past the devouring spirit, it had instead struck and breached the propane tank. Which had been just outside the flames licking up the kitchen wall.  Boom. I don’t remember the blast itself, only the sudden relocation, the pain, the ringing.

It mattered not. I fled, my escape route now within reach. The boathouse, while not more defensible than my cabin, was the bastion of the island. The central touchstone during periods of coming and going. And I was doing my best to go. It was also the most likely place to find Rico once the sun rose. And hell, if necessary, I could jump from the dock and tread water for as long as required. Could hares swim? I prayed not.

Just before my lungs gave out, I was stopped dead in my tracks by the scene developing on the path before me. The boy, Sam. He was squatting in the middle of the way. Crouched over and twitching as if he were frantically playing a flute.  I slowly approached to see that, no, in fact, he was rooting around in his own mouth with a pair of pliers. Spelunking with that cold metal for another tooth, I suppose. Another offering. Even as tears grow at the corners of his eyes. Giving everything he can for the return of his childhood pet. And instead, unwittingly birthing the monstrosity that now stalked the island.

The monster that was, at this very moment, casually approaching the opposite side of the abyss in the road, having managed to pass me through the wood. Shining the yellow light of his eyes upon the child's morbid offering, and then at me.

Cold and ruthless clarity struck me then. A knowing beyond reason. The limitations of choice. The leveraging of loss.  How one thing could cost another. My life as a whole melted down into a coin and weighed against the suffering of existence. The coin. The offering. It was the price of passage. If I could pay. If I wanted to survive.

The black velvet bag rose before me, reaching eye level like a cosmic jellyfish, darker than the waters in which it swam. My head swam, and I was almost entirely disconnected from my body. I watched those fingers pull at the knots, and turn the bag over, as one, two, three. Three pink diamonds flashed in the starlight before sinking into the nothingness at my feet.  Sam dove in after them first. The beast followed just a moment thereafter. I was left behind. In darkness. In silence. And for the first time in days, at peace.

It's not so bad. The shower gets cold in under three minutes, and the kitchen faucet leaks more and more each time the repairman leaves. Still, I can live with it.

I even met someone important to me, for the first time in years. And I actually expect it to last. I never told her this story, of course. She has such a pure heart, and I'd rather not put this particular spot of cyclopean darkness upon her lovely shoulders. I met her on a trip to the park, with a four-year-old named Sam, strangely enough. Sam had lost both of his parents, not just one, unlike the island's Sam.

I had joined the Big Brother program just a month after my escape from the island. I also volunteered at a soup kitchen. It wasn't a very lucrative way to spend my time, but somehow the horrors I’d lived through on that island served only to sharpen my awareness of the quieter horrors around us. The ones continually unfolding in plain sight.

Sam is currently my crowning achievement in that regard. I was making a real difference to him; I could see that every day. Every time he opens up a little more, every time he lets me glimpse what he’s been through. Every time he smiles, not because he’s trying to please, but because he knows I see him. That he’s not alone.

I only wish that I could bear to take him to the zoo without breaking out in sweat at each whiff of wet fur. And that I had enough money to treat him to lunch. 

And I do so worry that the old, half-blind cat that curls up with him in bed at the care home might not make it past the next [winter](https://dmblackwell.com).  ",3,1752668139.0,nosleep,0,0.81,False
1m1b0ai,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m1b0ai,Finally got it!,"Wanted to get an espresso focused grinder to replace my old C2. Due to budget constraints after buying Hibrew H10A and space limitations, I was looking for manual grinders that can also grind for espresso. While Kingrinder was an option, I decided to go for Timemore C3 ESP PRO due to lower price point. A relative was coming in from Singapore and I got it for about INR 7k. Been about 3 days and I've tried it for V60. Grind quality is super consistent but it really shines on espresso grind. I have just about dialed it in and the shots have been great. Easily one of the best bang-for-buck coffee related purchases I've made.",13,1752668113.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False
1m1aymh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m1aymh/where_can_you_buy_a_patio_table/,Where can you buy a patio table?,"As someone who recently went through the process of finding the perfect patio table, I know firsthand how challenging it can be. There are so many options out there, and it's not always clear where to start looking. After a lot of research and comparing different stores, I finally found a great source for high-quality patio tables that I want to share with you all.

One of the best places I discovered to buy patio tables is through this online store: https://athometouch.com/Patio-Tables. They have a wide selection of styles and sizes to fit any outdoor space. Whether you're looking for a small bistro table for your balcony or a large dining table for hosting backyard parties, they've got options to suit different needs and budgets.

What I really appreciate about shopping for patio tables online is the convenience. You can browse through dozens of choices from the comfort of your home, compare features and prices easily, and have your new table delivered right to your door. No need to drive around to different stores or lug a heavy table home yourself.

When choosing a patio table, there are a few key things to keep in mind:

1. Size - Measure your outdoor space and make sure the table will fit comfortably.
2. Material - Look for weather-resistant materials like aluminum, teak, or resin wicker that can withstand the elements.
3. Style - Choose a design that complements your existing outdoor décor.
4. Functionality - Consider if you want features like an umbrella hole or extendable leaf.

The store I mentioned earlier, https://athometouch.com/Patio-Tables, has detailed product descriptions that cover all these important factors. They also have customer reviews which can be really helpful in getting a sense of the quality and durability of different tables.

Of course, there are other places you can look for patio tables too. Local furniture stores and home improvement centers often carry outdoor furniture, especially during the spring and summer months. But in my experience, the selection tends to be more limited and prices can be higher compared to online options.

Some people also like to check out secondhand options through yard sales, thrift stores, or online marketplaces. While you might score a great deal this way, it can be hit or miss in terms of quality and condition. If you go this route, be sure to inspect the table carefully for any damage or wear.

Ultimately, where you choose to buy your patio table depends on your specific needs, budget, and preferences. But if you want a hassle-free shopping experience with lots of choices, I highly recommend checking out online stores like the one I linked above. They make it easy to find the perfect table to create your ideal outdoor living space.

Remember, a good patio table is an investment in your home and your lifestyle. It's where you'll enjoy morning coffee, family meals, and gatherings with friends. So take your time, do your research, and choose a table that you'll love using for years to come.",1,1752667977.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False
