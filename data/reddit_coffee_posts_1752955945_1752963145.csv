Thoughts & question: overthinking inside. & Obvious theory on why Rocky says Question so often... you all must have missed it among all that sexy fisting,"of bumps. 

\--spoilers tag used as= *sotto voce:*

**1st.** How did you understand the phrase: ""Why stupid. Question."" 

* a) Why are you stupid. That was a question. >!(Dlaczego glupi. Pytanie)!<
* b) Why are you stupid. I am asking. >!(Dlaczego glupi. Pytam)!<

I know its splitting hairs >!(more pronounced in polish & my americanized ear)!<, but IMO A is the obvious choice. Its more of a declarative statement about previous sentence... where as B is more disjoined 2nd statement. Rocky is *giving* Grace *the hint*; because there was a un worked out kink in translation software that Rocky caught on to quickly>!& off screen, hence theory, !<so '*dumbed down'* his language thereby necessitating this. On Erid, one Eridian asking something of another would have probably used some sonic inflection that software cant pick up on... instead of saying ""question"" as often. (Credit to Ray as in print I might have gone down option b thereby changing tone of beloved character. Without that cuteness i got with Ray's choices & hearing the notes played... Rocky is just another tag-along... everything felt flat in polish. No attempt at russian accent. I can finally see why some might not like this book). >!BTW When i listened to Polish version of Bobiverse: im confident would have still loved it in either language but yeah even more appreciation for Ray.!<

**2ndly...** Grace & Rocky '*spat*'/argument @ 1st Taumeba escape:

* Rocky: Why you not know where generator is. Question.... 
* Grace: Shut up.

Did you take that ""Shut up"" as truly having some bite in it? I took it as good nature ribbing that one bud says to another even with the crisis. & IMO Ray's reading makes it sound light-hearted. Any bite cuz of crisis not Grace's personality/feelings. While Polish translation's word choice & narrator's performance... While not horrible... 

& more so when Grace *demands/*asks for food/water/coffee from the med-bot. In Polish its an almost growled order, while in Ray's its begins as a plea >!given Grace's weekend state!<, later just a matter of fact request... This changes Grace's whole presentation to just a short sighted *meathead/averae guy* rather than trained scientist that applies reason TO EVERYTHING before speaking... >!(sadly this is what I predict i will see in movie... sure they threw in the ""better than growing in me"" line that is supposed to be endearing i guess, but that felt MUCH dumber than book's ""This is like stranger offering me candy. I want the candy(information), but i dont know the stranger."" IHMO). !<

  
**3rd-** When does fist my bump happen?... Im just missing it between skipping around to compare Polish v English with up to minute recollection. Pretty sure it was just removed from Polish version as translation would not make lick of sense.

Rest i care less about discussing... do with it what you will:

* We never hear grace play sounds @ Rocky in his language. Might have missed it being said explicitly, but given Rocky's better ears & memory/computation: he probably picked up English words much faster than Grace supposedly picked up on notes without software having to read the English.
* didnt Rocky loose a lot of muscle mass since Eridian ship design didn't do centrifuge for artificial-g?
* how does introducing an astrophage eater help sun 100%? shouldn't that only lower the # of astrophage not eliminate it completely? IE astrphage gets eaten on Venus / Adrian / 3World & so why did Grace seeing petrova line while entering system not comment: ""I see line but it is much weaker"". Sol: so sun still got bit weaker? solving global worming & if needed can nuke Venus to kill off some ameba ;-) whenever we want to make it warmer at ice ages?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

tau ceti is 3 years away at Grace speeds from Earth. (12LY=earth perspective each way & assuming Erid<>TC must be similar if not same)\*.

\+ 3-6months @ tau

\*must be <3 years for Grace to be able to burn some fuel heading back to earth, then some to find rocky given he used fuel as radar (some at least) & get to Erid.

\+so Rocky thought Erid will be fine for 70 years.

	Assuming he subtracted 3years or his trip already.

	Assuming he subtracted the 33? years he was in TauCeti system stuck alone.

...that still means Erid chose not to send out backup ship? or think of something to solve Astrophage problem? (in 45 years of waiting aka 1/2 their theoretical time allotted) & That is assuming Rocky's ""Erid will be OK for 70 years"" was the optimistic: 'dont go to war over resources or worse' estimate.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

At Erid:

supposedly Erid is 2x Earth gravity & them having access to space elevator & Grace needing artificial atmosphere anyway.

would it not make sense for him to get a space station like living accommodation built for him in orbit? Or their sister planet (no moon as i remember)?

	\--Instead of what was described with gravel & such, which must be on surface im assuming.

Unless Rocky & those Kids & that gravel are also station inhabitants. 

	In a way that would be more believable to me. 

& Sequel could be something going wrong on station & the 2 have to be brought out of retirement to save it before the station falls & causes some catastrophe on surface.

Or some other alien species sees Erid fixed Astrophage problem & come needing solution so Grace & Rockcy vs new species 1st contact.

Instead of trying to go global right away I went local and lifestylefocused: French Press starter kits, weekly subscriptions. Everything is fresh and packaged to appeal to young, design-conscious coffee drinkers.

Honestly I built the site with basic tools (landing page + WhatsApp integration + MPesa checkout) and leaned heavily on IG + word of mouth. It felt like a side hustle at first but now I'm getting **repeat customers, gifting orders, and even office requests**.

Next I will be testing Nairobi next — same East African vibe, but more mature coffee market.

**Biggest challenge now:**  
Scaling up roasting capacity better logistics, and maybe exploring fulfillment partners. I’m still doing a lot solo  and there’s growing interest I don’t want to drop the ball on.

Let's face it, we all need that perfect cup of tea or coffee to start our day right, and the right kettle can make all the difference.

Electric kettles have come a long way from the basic models of the past. Now, we've got options with temperature control, quick boiling times, and even smart features. But with so many choices out there, how do you know which one is the best?

First off, let's talk about speed. A good electric kettle should boil water fast. Nobody wants to wait around forever for their hot water, especially when you're in a rush in the morning. Look for kettles that can boil a full pot in under 5 minutes.

Next up is temperature control. This is a game-changer if you're into different types of tea or pour-over coffee. Green tea, for example, needs cooler water than black tea. A kettle with precise temperature settings can help you get the perfect brew every time.

Safety is another big factor. The best electric kettles have auto-shutoff features, so you don't have to worry about forgetting to turn it off. Some even have boil-dry protection, which stops the kettle if there's no water inside.

Material matters too. Stainless steel kettles are durable and don't affect the taste of your water. Glass kettles look nice and let you see the water boiling, but they can be more fragile.

Capacity is something to consider based on your needs. If you're just making tea for yourself, a smaller kettle might do. But if you often make hot drinks for a group, you'll want something bigger.

Now, let's talk about a few extra features that can be nice to have. Some kettles come with a keep-warm function, which is great if you like to sip your tea slowly. Others have a quiet boil feature, perfect if you're an early riser and don't want to wake up the whole house.

After trying out many different electric kettles, I've found some great options. If you're in the market for a new kettle, I'd recommend checking out this collection of top-rated electric kettles: https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. They've got a range of options to suit different needs and budgets.

Remember, the best electric kettle for you depends on your specific needs. Think about what features matter most to you. Do you need something that boils quickly? Are you particular about water temperature? Do you want something that looks good on your countertop?

In the end, a good electric kettle can make your daily routine a little bit easier and your hot drinks a lot more enjoyable. It's worth taking the time to find one that's right for you. Happy brewing!",1,1752961946.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Im also autistic and for the past ten years or so i've been focused on my health to resolve a few issues and find the source. A few years ago i got my genetics read by a basic 23andMe, but ran it through other more comprehensive genetic analysers based on evidence. I have dozens of mutations in the methylation cycle, its very complex and affects every aspect of health, particularly the nervous system, circulation, neurotransmitters. 

One among many was a mutation in the enzymes responsible for converting B6 into the active form P5P the body requires, so the B6 i was getting in food, and the previous B6 supplements of pyroxidine HCL were mostly useless. For the past 2 months i've been taking 25mg of P5P  twice a day, and my circulation has been even better than what i would consider 'norma', im still actually getting use to it. I can tell if its a bit chilly, but i don't shrivel up to the extent i did before. I also started to take colostrum which repairs and restores the microbiome that we ideally acquire from birth from our mother. Since taking this i have started sweating again, which is usually difficult for me unless in a sauna or direct summer heat. My digestion and stool has also normalised, even before caffeine. 

Caffeine has always been another triggers, but i love coffee and enjoy making my own at home, since starting B6 and colostrum (also l-theanine, electrolytes), i've been able to have 3 americanos without irritability, anxiety and the vasoconstriction. This is likely because B6 is required for glutamata to GABA conversion which slows neurotransmission and overstimulation, as well as nitric oxide production.

 Your resolution may be slightly different but its worth checking as you could have some mutations in your methylation cycles affecting your immune system and stress response.",0,1752961795.0,Raynauds,1,0.5,False

Friendly, convenient, safe location, amazingly luxurious 900 sq ft 2 BR at 1960 Madison Ave. The place includes a new in unit washer/dryer (game changer), dishwasher, microwave, independently controlled air conditioning/ heat units for each bedroom (no more fights over the temp), video intercom, beautiful hardwood floors, etc.
The real kicker: because I'm the actual owner, repairs, maintenance, and other building stuff all comes straight through me. No BS management company to wait on hold for, annoying tenant portals, etc.
Both bedrooms offer direct access to a private terrace overlooking a quiet backyard-a perfect spot for a peaceful morning coffee, evening unwinding, or spending time with your favorite plants. There's also a spacious living room with gorgeous big windows that feels like an art gallery.

Super convenient spot with tons of restaurants and deli's just steps from the door and a Whole Foods 2 blocks away. But the REAL SELL is that it's so easy to get around from here. The 2 or 3 trains are just 2 blocks away at the 125th Street stop, and the 4,5, & 6 are just 2 blocks in the other direction at 125th and Lexington Ave stop. Also, you're only one stop from Grand Central on the Metro North which is only 1 Block Away!! It's also convenient to the cross-town 125th Street buses, near the FDR drive, Triborough Bridge, and street parking here is rarely an issue.
Overall, I would say it is quite a good value compared to other Manhattan neighborhoods.

Also she says here as someone who’s 5”3 BUT WE KNOW she’s taller than that (5”4 🙄🙄🙄)


We also know that as much as she claims to be dairy, gluten free, alcohol free, coffee free etc she IS NOT. She drinks 2-3 coffee per day (and shows it). She eats gluten and dairy on camera (hello Dairy Queen) and even though she’s apparently also allergic to pizza she eats it all the time. She’s full of shit and next thing you know she’ll be allergic to oxygen. 

I’m surprised she didn’t say auto immune this time tbh.

**DARK LORD ASCENDING**

https://preview.redd.it/i979xkr9gwdf1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=896e0448d589d69a46d9c7f5736f704c54996bec

Severus Snape appear out of nowhere and walk to a long driveway. He enter the manor house and hesitate at a huge door that enters onto a drawing room, where a fire casts light on a dining table and a person hanging upside-down over it. Voldemort greets Snape and asks him to sit next to him. Snape tells the table that Harry Potter will be moved next Saturday, though Yaxley challenges this and insists that Harry will move a week later. They argue and Snape says that Yaxley's source—Dawlish, an Auror at the Ministry—isn't reliable.

One man snickers that the Order of the Phoenix is correct in believing that the Death Eaters have infiltrated the Ministry. Voldemort ignores this and asks Snape where Harry will go next. Snape explains he'll go to the home of an Order member, and they won't be able to get to him there unless the Ministry has fallen by the time Harry moves. Voldemort turns to Yaxley, who proudly says that he put an Imperius Curse on Pius Thicknesse. Many seem impressed, but Voldemort says he needs Scrimgeour. Yaxley explains that they have people planted in the transportation office, so they'll know if Harry Apparates or uses Floo Powder. Snape says that the Order is going to move him in the open.

Voldemort looks at the hanging body and says that he's going to deal with Harry himself as to not let anyone else make mistakes. Everyone seems afraid that they'll be punished, but Voldemort says that he needs to be the one to kill Harry. A scream comes from somewhere in the manor, and Voldemort sends Wormtail to deal with it. Voldemort asks Lucius Malfoy to borrow his wand. Malfoy hesitates and glances at Narcissa Malfoy before passing his wand over. He makes a small movement as though to take Voldemort's wand, which Voldemort laughs at.

Voldemort points his wand at the hanging figure, who wakes up. The woman, Charity Burbage, asks Snape for help as Voldemort explains that she was the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. Voldemort gags her and says that she ""polluted"" students' minds, and she wants pureblooded wizards to reproduce with Muggles and werewolves. Voldemort kills her and lets Nagini eat her.

**BATTLE OF THE SEVEN POTTERS**

https://preview.redd.it/968xfbecgwdf1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17f8e3c7811480de09394ee5fac90033ec4a4721

Harry, bleeding, pushes out of his bedroom, steps on a cup of tea—probably a trap set by Dudley—and rinses his hand in the bathroom. Harry returns to his room and carefully looks through the bottom of his school trunk, where he finds the thing that made him bleed: a piece of an enchanted mirror that Sirius gave him.

Hedwig ignores Harry as he begins to go through the pile of newspapers on his desk. He finds the issue containing an obituary written by Elphias Doge about Dumbledore and sits down to read it. Doge writes about how he met Dumbledore at Hogwarts as first years, and Dumbledore was shockingly kind to him. Dumbledore arrived at school haunted by the news of his father Percival's horrific anti-Muggle crime, though Dumbledore proved to share none of his father's beliefs. He soon became famous as a brilliant student, went on to win prizes, and loved to teach. When his brother Aberforth arrived at Hogwarts three years later, the boys turned out to be very different but still great friends.

Doge writes that he and Dumbledore planned to tour the world after finishing school, but the death of Dumbledore's mother, Kendra, meant that Dumbledore couldn't come. His sister Ariana died about a year later, and Doge came home for the funeral to find Dumbledore miserable and estranged from Aberforth. Doge briefly recounts Dumbledore's biggest triumphs over the next few decades and then says that Dumbledore died working for the greater good.

Harry turns to the most recent Prophet issue and sees an article titled ""Dumbledore—The Truth at Last?"" It announces Rita Skeeter's next book, a biography of Dumbledore exploring his secrets. Harry finds the rest of the article, an interview with Skeeter, and reads that she finished the 900-page book four weeks after Dumbledore's death. Skeeter laughs at Doge's insistence that the biography is devoid of facts, and promises to expose Dumbledore's youthful interest in questionable beliefs and the Dark Arts, as well as ""nastiness"" concerning Kendra and Ariana, and the revelation that Dumbledore's famed defeat of Grindelwald wasn't spectacular. Skeeter mentions a chapter about Harry and questions whether or not Harry's belief that Snape killed Dumbledore is a lie. Harry feels ill and angry and tosses the paper against the wall. He picks up the mirror fragment and sees a flash of a blue eye. He's sure he imagined seeing Dumbledore's eye, as Dumbledore is dead.

Harry hears Vernon calling for him. He takes his time putting down the mirror fragment and goes downstairs to find Vernon, Petunia, and Dudley all dressed for traveling. Vernon tells Harry he's decided he doesn't believe it and won't go. Vernon recoils when Harry reminds him of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Mr. Weasley's visit a few weeks ago, when they explained that the Dursleys won't be safe here once Harry turns seventeen. Vernon asks why the Ministry can't protect them, but Harry reminds him that the Ministry is compromised. Harry points out that the ""accidents"" on TV are Voldemort, not accidents, and the fog is caused by dementors. Dudley looks terrified, but Vernon asks what they're supposed to do about work and school. Dudley says loudly that he's going with the Order.

Dedalus Diggle and Hestia Jones arrive and greet the Dursleys. Dedalus explains the plan and politely asks Vernon if he can drive. Vernon is flabbergasted, especially when Dedalus's pocket watch screams at them to hurry up. Vernon makes to shake Harry's hand but can't bring himself to do it and then heads to the door with Petunia. Dudley, however, asks why Harry isn't coming with them, and where he's going to go. Everyone is shocked, and Hestia gets angry when Vernon says that Harry's going off with ""their lot."" Harry reassures her and says that the Dursleys think he's a waste of space, but Dudley says he doesn't think that about Harry since Harry saved his life.

https://preview.redd.it/m1e6svxegwdf1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b737d92e8e060ebfbd7aa0cd8042d21fdf504de

Harry stares at Dudley and realizes that Dudley may have left the cup of tea as an act of kindness, not a trap. Dudley pulls away from Petunia and shakes Harry's hand. They smile at each other and Dudley leaves. Harry and Petunia stare at each other for a moment and it seems as though she wants to say something, but she leaves without a word.

https://preview.redd.it/z54dhzelgwdf1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a66dd73e748fe0ebadc15baa1ceafd0027b3e97

Harry watches the Dursleys drive away and then moves his things downstairs, thinking it's strange to be in the house for the last time. Hedwig continues to ignore Harry as he opens up the closet under the stairs, noticing how small it looks. Hearing a roar outside, Harry sees people appear in the backyard, including Hagrid on a giant motorcycle. Ron greets Harry as Mad-Eye Moody, Hermione, Fred, George, Bill, Mr. Weasley, Tonks, Lupin, Fleur, Kingsley, and Mundungus Fletcher file into the kitchen. Tonks gleefully waves her new wedding ring at Harry, but Moody calls them to attention and explains there's been a change of plan.

https://preview.redd.it/y23i0f9kgwdf1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23896607d9c09f579a00d59e9275486a9c3e038a

Since the Ministry can still spy on Harry using his Trace, they're going to break the protection guaranteed by Lily's sacrifice early by moving to one of several secure locations. To throw off any waiting Death Eaters, there will be seven Harrys, thanks to Polyjuice Potion. Harry refuses to let his friends sacrifice for him, and Fred and George tease him for trying to stop this. Moody growls that this is the only way and furiously, Harry pulls out hair and hands it to Moody. Those who will impersonate Harry line up and accept a cup of Polyjuice Potion. After they transform, they change clothes, put on glasses, and grab fake luggage.

https://preview.redd.it/9qsld56tgwdf1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9870ba10a60b8180147807e85116398c0067d89

After Harry lets Hedwig fly free in the sky, Moody barks out who's traveling with whom by broom and thestral. Harry is anxious to learn he'll be riding with Hagrid on the motorcycle, but Moody explains that Voldemort will expect Harry on a broom. In the garden, Harry climbs into the motorcycle's sidecar. Hagrid points out trick buttons as Moody sends everyone off. Within a minute, Harry sees hooded figures shooting spells at him. Harry starts shooting curses at the Death Eaters.

Hagrid starts pushing buttons and a brick wall erupts from the exhaust pipe. Harry shoots more curses as Hagrid deploys a net and then dragon fire. The acceleration causes the sidecar to start to separate, so Hagrid pulls out his pink umbrella and the sidecar comes entirely apart. Harry levitates the sidecar and finally, Hagrid grabs Harry and throws him onto the back of his seat. Suddenly, one of the Death Eaters fires the Killing Curse, but Hedwig suddenly appears and sacrifices herself, allowing herself to be hit by the curse. Harry shoots a jinx at Stan Shunpike and, suddenly, the Death Eaters shout ""it's the real one"" and disappear.

https://preview.redd.it/iclo3b4xgwdf1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cef135e449bea18b66f783a86514632c0256fe4b

Hagrid uses the dragon fire button again and as they start to descend, Harry sees Voldemort flying without a broom. Hagrid starts a vertical dive and throws himself off the bike onto a Death Eater. Harry can't see from the pain in his scar, but his wand spins of its own accord and shoots golden fire at Voldemort, exploding Voldemort's wand. Harry punches the dragon fire button, and Harry stares into Voldemort's eyes before Voldemort suddenly vanishes. The bike crashes into a pond.

Harry drags himself out of the pond, bleeding, and calls for Hagrid. He comes to inside, his injuries healed, and Ted Tonks introduces himself. Ted explains that his wife is seeing to Hagrid. Harry starts to get up just as Hagrid squeezes through the door. Noticing the woman behind Hagrid, Harry shouts at her, but Ted says she's his wife, Andromeda Tonks. Mrs. Tonks looks shockingly like her sister, Bellatrix Lestrange. Harry says they need to take the Portkey to the Burrow. Ted assures Andromeda that Tonks is fine and leads Harry and Hagrid into a bedroom, where a hairbrush is waiting for them. Hagrid asks where Hedwig is and Harry gulps that she died. Harry and Hagrid spin away from the Tonks' house and land hard in the yard of the Burrow. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny run toward them. Nobody else is back.

Lupin and George arrive. George is unconscious and bleeding: his ear is missing. Harry helps Lupin carry him inside. Lupin grabs Harry, verifies his identity, and explains that someone betrayed them. Harry can't believe that someone in the Order betrayed them and, to support this, says that it took Voldemort a while to figure out which one was the real Harry—he couldn't have known the entire plan. He tells Lupin of his journey and says that he Disarmed Stan Shunpike, which shocks Lupin. Lupin tells Harry to Stun people if he's not going to kill them. He says that Death Eaters likely think that Expelliarmus is Harry's signature spell, but Harry says he won't be like Voldemort and kill people for no reason.

https://preview.redd.it/w5jwd0i2hwdf1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f96a08fccbec6a01114c5fe31c06fa7b03875f0

Kingsley and Hermione land in the yard. Kingsley and Lupin suspiciously test each other and Kingsley spits that someone betrayed them. Lupin says that Snape is the one who cursed George's ear off as Hagrid calls Harry inside. They hear a crash and Mr. Weasley roars that he needs to see his son. He and Fred enter and Fred seems lost for words. George stirs and says he feels ""saintlike."" He meets Fred's eyes and says that he's ""holey."" Mrs. Weasley sobs.

Ginny and Harry head back outside and Ginny takes Harry's hand. They watch Kingsley pace and suddenly, Tonks and Ron barrel to the ground on brooms. Tonks falls into Lupin's arms as Hermione embraces Ron. Tonks explains that Bellatrix was trying to kill her as Bill and Fleur fly into sight. Mrs. Weasley flies at Bill, who says that Moody is dead: Mundungus panicked and Disapparated, and Voldemort got Moody. They head inside and Bill pours firewhiskey for everyone. They drink to Moody and decide that Mundungus didn't betray them; he just panicked.

Harry excuses himself and steps outside as the pain in his scar reaches a peak and Harry hears and sees Voldemort yelling at Ollivander that using another person's wand was supposed to work. Harry returns to his own mind in the garden when Hermione and Ron ask him to come inside. He tells them what he saw, and Hermione sternly says to not let Voldemort into his mind.

**MARRIAGE**

Ron shakes Harry awake from a dream in which Harry was looking for a man who can solve his problem. Ron tells Harry that he was muttering ""Gregorovitch,"" a name that neither of them can place. Realizing he's seventeen now, Harry starts performing magic and accepts Ron's present, a book on how to woo witches. Downstairs, Mrs. Weasley directs Harry to the present on the top of the pile. It's a watch, which she explains belonged to her brother and is a traditional gift for a seventeen-year-old.  Hermione grabs Harry's presents to pack them as Ginny calls Harry into her bedroom.

https://preview.redd.it/42jce5ychwdf1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36f0d7e02c64d40fd798a0d4212fecc2f648694b

Ginny meets Harry's eyes and says she had no idea what to get him that he'd be able to take with him, so she wants to give him something to remember her by. She kisses him, but Ron bursts in and interrupts. Harry feels as though Ron reminds him of all of the reasons Harry broke up with Ginny in the first place. He follows Ron and Hermione outside, where Ron turns on Harry and tells Harry to stop groping Ginny. Ginny ignores Harry for the rest of the day.

Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid arrive for Harry's birthday dinner. Mrs. Weasley carries out a cake decorated like a Snitch. Lupin looks oddly unhappy. Everyone waits for Mr. Weasley until his Patronus arrives, saying that Scrimgeour is coming with him. Lupin drags Tonks away and, a moment later, Mr. Weasley and Scrimgeour arrive. Scrimgeour requests to speak with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They go to the sitting room and the trio refuse to speak to Scrimgeour individually. He explains that he's here because of Dumbledore's will, and Hermione scathingly says that the Ministry has probably been going through Dumbledore's things for the last month, after which they have to give them up.

https://preview.redd.it/te0dpkgfhwdf1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29bbd39a940ccdfc042c0b2f97aa8c0cb2d9ae67

Scrimgeour ignores Hermione and asks Ron if he and Dumbledore were close. Ron says they weren't, and Scrimgeour wants to know why Dumbledore left him anything. Scrimgeour pulls out the will and reads that Ron should receive his Deluminator, an item that looks like a cigarette lighter that sucks lights out of a place. Scrimgeour pulls out a book titled The Tales of Beedle the Bard for Hermione. Finally, Scrimgeour gives Harry the Snitch that he caught during his first Quidditch match. Scrimgeour asks if there's more to it, and Hermione points out that Snitches have ""flesh memories;"" Dumbledore could've left something inside that only Harry could access. Harry touches the Snitch but nothing happens. None of them can explain why Dumbledore left them these objects.

Finally, Scrimgeour says that Dumbledore also left Harry the sword of Gryffindor, which he says wasn't Dumbledore's to give. He angrily asks if Dumbledore thought Harry could use it to kill Voldemort, but Harry suggests that the Ministry try killing Voldemort with swords instead of covering up Azkaban breakouts. Harry and Scrimgeour both stand and Scrimgeour pokes his wand at Harry's chest, leaving a small burn in Harry's shirt. Mr. Weasley and Mrs. Weasley burst in and Scrimgeour steps back. He tells Harry that they should work together, but Harry refuses. Scrimgeour leaves.

Over dinner, the guests pass around the objects from Dumbledore. They eat quickly and then Harry, Ron, and Hermione meet in Ron's bedroom. Harry puts the Marauder's Map, the shard from Sirius's mirror, and the locket into his moleskin bag. They agree that Dumbledore knew the Ministry would search the contents of his will, but can't figure out why he didn't tell them about these things in life. Harry admits that he didn't try to open the Snitch in front of Scrimgeour; this is the Snitch he almost swallowed. He puts it to his lips and it doesn't open, but the words ""I open at the close"" appear.

https://preview.redd.it/md1k48oihwdf1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=09a57dc4c4ea0ee250897fc4273165c478be0465

Harry sits up straight and calls Hermione and Ron to attention. They roll their eyes and tell Harry to not even bother trying to convince them to not come. Hermione says she's been packing for days, has stolen Moody's stock of Polyjuice Potion, and has modified her parents' memories and sent them to Australia to protect them. She tells Ron to show Harry what he's done, and Ron leads Harry to the attic. There, Harry sees the Weasleys' ghoul with red hair, pustules, and pajamas—once Ron leaves, the ghoul will move into Ron's room to pose as Ron with spattergroit. Both of these measures will explain Ron and Hermione's absences from Hogwarts.

Hermione suggests that the trio should figure out where they're going first and says she thinks that going to Godric's Hollow isn't the best plan. She suggests that Voldemort might have spies there. Ron suggests that R.A.B. might have already destroyed the real Horcrux, but Hermione points out they need to track it down anyway. Ron asks how a person destroys a Horcrux, and Hermione turns pink and says she's been researching. She explains that the books on Horcruxes were taken out of the library, but she was able to Summon them out of Dumbledore's office after he died. She pulls the book out.

Hermione tells Ron that a person can put their soul back together if they feel remorse, which Voldemort will never do. She reads that basilisk fangs are one of the only surefire ways of destroying a Horcrux, as they have to destroy Horcruxes ""beyond magical repair."" Ron asks if the soul can then go live in something else, but Hermione explains that Horcruxes are the opposite of people: stabbing Ron wouldn't harm his soul, while Horcruxes depend on their containers to survive. Ron asks how Tom Riddle's diary was able to possess Ginny, and Hermione explains that it can happen when a person gets emotionally close to a Horcrux. Harry wonders how Dumbledore destroyed the ring as Mrs. Weasley bursts in and demands help with wedding gifts.

https://preview.redd.it/9cr1us0lhwdf1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f949933a304dd09589ed5ec0ea34f2b4a4eb89d1

The next afternoon, Ron, Fred, George, and Harry prepare to show wedding guests to their seats. Harry shows Lupin and Tonks to their seats and notices again that Lupin looks miserable. When Harry gets back to the entrance, he meets Xenophilius Lovegood, Luna's father. He's dressed eccentrically in bright yellow robes and wears a pendant that looks like an odd, triangular eye. Ron appears with Auntie Muriel, an ancient witch who insults Fleur, suggests that Hermione had skinny ankles, and insults George´s ""lopsided"" ears. Viktor Krum arrives. Hermione is ecstatic, but Ron rudely asks Krum why he came. Harry shows Krum to his seat and then sits down. Fleur and Monsieur Delacour come down the aisle, Ginny and Gabrielle behind them. When the ceremony is over, a dance floor appears.

Ron, Harry, and Hermione join Luna at an empty table. When Luna gets up to dance, Krum takes her seat. He scowls, wants to know who Xenophilius is, and looks even less pleased when Ron drags Hermione to dance. Krum growls at Harry that Xenophilius is wearing the evil wizard Grindelwald's sign. Harry is perplexed; he's sure that Xenophilius doesn't support the Dark Arts. He does a poor job of explaining that the Lovegoods likely don't know what the symbol means and then blurts, ""Gregorovitch."" Harry remembers that Gregorovitch is the wandmaker who made Krum's wand and thinks that Voldemort is looking for a wandmaker who might know more than Ollivander. Krum strides off.

Later that evening, Harry recognizes Elphias Doge sitting alone, joins him, and reveals his identity. They discuss that Doge knew Dumbledore well, and Harry asks if he saw Rita Skeeter's insistence that Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts. Doge tells Harry to not believe it, but Harry isn't reassured—this isn't a matter of belief; Harry wants the truth. As Doge prepares to reassure Harry more, Auntie Muriel joins them, cackling that she needs to pre-order Rita Skeeter's book. She guzzles champagne and accuses Doge of ignoring the darker parts of Dumbledore's past in his obituary. She crows that Dumbledore ""did away with his Squib sister,"" but Doge says that Dumbledore kept her existence quiet because Ariana was unwell. Muriel suggests that Ariana was kept locked in a cellar by Kendra and Dumbledore.

https://preview.redd.it/yifv6unnhwdf1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e9dc2900359cbe1f77062631d74c4c28ec2f788

Muriel insists that the Dumbledore family kept Ariana a secret because of shame, while Doge insists that Ariana was just unwell. Muriel cackles as she says that Aberforth broke Dumbledore's nose at Ariana's funeral, and Dumbledore didn't defend himself. Harry doesn't know what's true, but he finds it hard to believe that Dumbledore would stand for cruelty in his home. Muriel hiccups that Rita Skeeter surely got the inside scoop from Bathilda Bagshot, who was a close friend of the Dumbledores in Godric's Hollow. Harry chokes on his drink. He's shocked to learn that Dumbledore was also from Godric's Hollow and that he never said anything. Harry feels lied to. Hermione comes over just as Kingsley's lynx Patronus arrives and announces that the Ministry fell and Scrimgeour is dead.

Harry and Hermione race through the panicking crowd, trying to find Ron. They find him and Hermione Apparates with them to Tottenham Court Road in London. Hermione leads them into an alley and out of her tiny beaded purse pulls out changes of clothes and the Cloak. She explains that she has an Extension Charm on her purse. Hermione leads them into a greasy cafe. They order coffees and Hermione hisses that they already know what Voldemort is up to; there's no need to head for the Leaky Cauldron. A minute later, two workmen squeeze into another booth. They wave their waitress away as Hermione reaches into her purse for money. The workmen draw wands, as does Harry, and they shoot spells at each other. Harry Stuns one and tries to get the other. Hermione binds the man after he blows up part of the cafe. Harry and Ron recognize them as Death Eaters, lock the door, and turn out the lights. Hermione performs a Memory Charm on them while Harry and Ron put the cafe back in order.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione wonder how the Death Eaters found them. Ron and Hermione refuse, but Harry is able to convince them to go to Grimmauld Place. They reason that Snape is the only Death Eater who can get in, and they know that Moody put charms in place to thwart Snape's entry. They Apparate there and let themselves in. Harry takes a step forward. Moody's voice asks, ""Severus Snape?"" and the trio's tongues roll up and flatten again. Then, a horrific effigy of Dumbledore flies at them and explodes when Harry says that they didn't kill him.

Harry wakes up the next morning and sees that it looks like Ron and Hermione fell asleep holding hands. He gets up and begins to explore the upstairs bedrooms. He goes up another floor and enters Sirius's room. The walls are plastered in Gryffindor hangings, motorcycles, and Muggle girls in bikinis. There's one photo of Sirius, James, Lupin, and Wormtail, but it's stuck to the wall with a Permanent Sticking Charm. Looking through the detritus on the floor, Harry finds the first page of a letter that Lily wrote to Sirius, thanking him for a toy broomstick that he sent Harry for his first birthday. She writes that Bathilda came for birthday tea and that James is going stir crazy since Dumbledore has his Invisibility Cloak and he can't sneak out. The last half-sentence says that Bathilda shared something incredible about Dumbledore, but though Harry looks, he can't find the second page of the letter.

Hermione shouts for Harry from downstairs, and she and Ron are angry and relieved to find him. She reads Lily's letter and then they discuss who ransacked the house. Harry suggests they go to Godric's Hollow to speak to Bathilda Bagshot, but Hermione points out that she can't help them with the Horcruxes. They start to leave for the kitchen, but on the landing, Harry stops in front of Sirius's brother's room and realizes that Regulus Arcturus Black is probably the R.A.B. from the locket. Hermione shouts for Ron.

The three step into the room, which is decorated with Slytherin hangings and the Black family crest. They spend some time searching for the real locket with no success and then head downstairs. Hermione reminds Harry and Ron of all the horrible items they had to get rid of two years ago, but she stops dead when she remembers that they found a locket that none of them could open. Harry reasons that Kreacher could've stolen it, so they search his bedroom. Finally, Harry calls Kreacher and Kreacher appears in the kitchen. He forbids Kreacher from muttering insults and learns that Kreacher did steal the locket, but Mundungus Fletcher then stole ""Master Regulus's locket."" Harry stops Kreacher from punishing himself.

Crying, Kreacher says he saw Mundungus steal the locket. Harry asks Kreacher to tell them what Regulus has to do with the locket. Kreacher explains that Regulus joined the Death Eaters and, a year later, volunteered Kreacher to perform a task for Voldemort and then come home. Kreacher accompanied Voldemort to a cave by the sea and drank the potion in a basin. Voldemort left Kreacher on the island after covering the locket with more potion. The Inferi drug Kreacher under the water, but Kreacher followed orders and came home. Hermione and Ron note that elf magic is different than wizard magic, and Voldemort likely didn't consider that Kreacher would survive because of his magic.

https://preview.redd.it/q7k2r6azhwdf1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5677c61661e7b920c3a0f6a2d922cd2ab48d0391

A while later, Regulus asked Kreacher to take him to the cave. There, Regulus drank the potion and told Kreacher to switch the lockets, destroy the real one, and tell nobody. Kreacher sobs that he couldn't destroy the locket. Harry asks why Kreacher was willing to betray Sirius to Voldemort when Regulus died to bring Voldemort down. Hermione points out that Kreacher is loyal to people who are kind to him, which Sirius wasn't. She notes that Narcissa and Bellatrix certainly were, which is why he passed information to them. Harry gives Kreacher a moment and then asks him to find Mundungus so they can find the locket. Kreacher nods, but dissolves into tears when Harry presents him with the fake locket.

In the hallway, someone lets himself in and Harry points his wand at the intruder. Hermione and Ron join him as Mrs. Black's portrait screams. Lupin announces himself and praises Harry for testing his identity. They head to the kitchen. Lupin doesn't think Harry has the Trace on him and explains that most of the wedding guests Disapparated before Death Eaters arrived. They seemed to not know that Harry was there, and Lupin says that Scrimgeour apparently died refusing to give away Harry's whereabouts. The Death Eaters searched every home connected to the Order and interrogated everyone—they now have the power to do whatever they want. He pushes a copy of the Daily Prophet at Harry. The headline reads that they want Harry for Dumbledore's murder. Lupin says that the coup was so quiet that nobody knows the truth, and blaming Harry makes people afraid that the resistance isn't legitimate.

Lupin says that the Ministry has also started to ""survey"" Muggle-borns and are rounding them up and accusing them of stealing magic. He explains that attendance at Hogwarts is now required, and all students must prove that they're descended from wizards before being allowed to attend. Lupin confirms that Harry is on a mission from Dumbledore, offers to accompany the trio, and insists he doesn't need to know what the mission is. Hermione asks about Tonks and Lupin says she's pregnant as though he's admitting something nasty. He says that Tonks will be safe with her parents.

https://preview.redd.it/ldk3ikhaiwdf1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ee8160fa46f85637ae3eb5d015771a90f868ec3

Lupin insists that James would've wanted him to protect Harry, but Harry says that James would've wanted Lupin to stay with his baby. Harry and Lupin fight and Harry suggests that Lupin is abandoning his family and behaving like a coward. Lupin insists that he shouldn't have married Tonks and shouldn't have risked passing on his werewolfism to a child before cursing Harry and leaving. Both Ron and Hermione reprimand Harry, but Harry asks if it'll be worth it if Lupin goes back to Tonks.

Kreacher Apparates into the kitchen with a crack, bearing Mundungus. Hermione takes Mundungus's wand and Ron tackles the struggling man. Mundungus gives excuses for why he Disapparated during Harry's move, but Harry starts to ask about the locket. Kreacher hits Mundungus over the head with a saucepan, but Harry calls him off. Mundungus explains that he had to turn over the locket to a toad-like ""Ministry hag"" with a bow on her head when he was caught selling without a license. Harry realizes that the ""hag"" is Dolores Umbridge.

Of course it’s a fantastic concept but the reviews are, let’s say, mixed… apparently many people find the owner and/or staff rude. 

I visited today (to celebrate my birthday 🎂) and I have to admit I was a little apprehensive, but I’m very pleased to say it was lovely.

It’s a small shop, so they don’t have “every” cookbook you can imagine, but they do have  a lot, and seem to prioritise classic titles or new but less well-known books over those in the best selling lists/celebrity/influencer category.

They had quite a few US titles that haven’t been released here, which is nice, but would not be so interesting to US visitors, of course.

I only spent 10 minutes there (my 3-year-old daughter won’t let me spend any longer in any shop) but I left feeling very happy and carrying 2 titles that I had not found in the usual chain bookstores (Waterstones and Daunt): Taboon by Hisham Assad (lebanese bakery recipes) and Torta della Nonna by Emiko Davies (homemade Italian desserts).

They have a room at the back with some tables where they serve lunch or baked goods cooked using recipes from select cookbooks, but I went in the afternoon so I had just missed that. 

Definitely recommend it to those visiting the area.

We were going to Madeleine’s a few times a week that spring. May would come with the lilacs blooming and I’d put my denim jacket on and start from Old Street in the late afternoon walking up towards Angel. I’d first pass by the little church with the big plane trees in front and the pub to its left crowded with youth now. I’d stop and watch for a moment the fine plane trees with their bright leaves and creamy white trunk patches and feel how they and the old church and the new bustle coming up from the pub really belonged together, much like in a picture. I’d go up City Road then and see the pretty houses with large flower gardens on the right and the big trees on both sides of the boulevard. I’d then stop at the shop in the middle of my way and buy the best cheap white wine there was and feel the niceness of putting the two bottles in my denim jacket’s wide inner pockets. Then I’d always be glad when I came to one house with very large bay windows on the ground floor through which I’d look at a young couple drinking coffee or tea or going about in the kitchen. I remember how nice it felt to wear my denim jacket for the first time after the long winter.

We’d stand on that roof on Chapel Market from the late afternoon until late in the morning. We’d reach the roof through the window of Madeleine’s room and we’d place a small wooden table on it and sit around it on small folding chairs. I’d watch her come through the window wearing her bright clothes now with the May sunset on them and her creamy blue eyes above them, and we’d watch her take care of us and she’d be shy as we watched her. I remember her girlish raspy voice in that way that French girls have it and how we were all excited to be in a woman’s place. We were each in love with Madeleine and I loved another girl too and at the time there was no contradiction in it. I remember watching us all and watching the little street paling slowly below and then fading and how the evening grew cooler and how we grew warmer with the drinks. I remember how we were serious like children in those final nights of spring.

Then June came with the heavy sense of summer. I remember watching *Solaris* in 'Close-up' and how that June was really messy, especially after *Solaris*. I went to watch it with my best friend Will Gibson. Will was a great man in those days, and he’d drag me to the movies often, always stuffing his old mate bag with good wine. I loved walking in London with Will and we walked up all the way from London Bridge to Shoreditch, stopping at cafes for a drink and talking about all the fine things that were on Will’s mind back then. I remember going into the cinema very much in love and then there was that unimaginable music and Hari, and Don Quixote, and the Bruegel picture with the silence, and the heavy silence as the film ended and then we came out and I was already painfully in love as it happens after the great work of art. I remember going back home after the movie with this heavy feeling pulling me into something very painful and very right. That night I did not sleep and everything changed for a long time, and it was not the change that always remained in me but the memory of the feeling it caused back then.

In the following days we drank a lot and I gave a flower bouquet to a girl for the first time and those were very chaotic days. I couldn’t stop walking and I walked to every party and every little gathering there was. There were the great bridges at night and the grey river dragging down as I walked above it. There was me looking at friends for the last time and looking at lovers dancing in the Jazz club and a first kiss exchanged in the lobby. There was young men’s devotion to Bach. There were the sad returns home in the mornings. I remember a street turning blue with the dawn and a deserted bus station. I remember everything.

I've tested multiple models and talked to other coffee lovers to bring you this comprehensive guide.

The K-Elite is currently the best overall Keurig coffee maker. I switched to this model last year, and the difference in coffee quality is noticeable. It offers temperature control, which is crucial for getting the perfect cup of coffee. You can brew anything from 4 to 12 ounces, and it has a strong brew option for those mornings when you need an extra kick.

If you're interested in checking out the K-Elite and other top Keurig models, you can find them here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

For smaller spaces or single-person households, the K-Mini Plus is an excellent choice. It's compact but doesn't compromise on coffee quality. I recommended this model to my sister who lives in a studio apartment, and she loves how it fits perfectly in her tiny kitchen.

The K-Supreme Plus SMART is worth considering if you're tech-savvy. It remembers your favorite brew settings and connects to your phone. While it's pricier, the customization options are impressive. You can adjust everything from strength to temperature to cup size.

Budget-conscious coffee drinkers should look at the K-Classic. It's straightforward, reliable, and makes great coffee without fancy features. I started with this model and used it daily for two years without issues.

Here's what to consider when choosing your Keurig:
- Brewing size options
- Counter space
- Water reservoir capacity
- Temperature control
- Extra features (iced coffee, hot water dispenser)
- Price point

You can compare all these models and their features here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

Regular maintenance is key for any Keurig. I descale mine every three months and clean the needle monthly. This keeps the coffee tasting fresh and the machine running smoothly.

For the best coffee experience, I suggest using a reusable K-cup filter. It's better for the environment and lets you use your favorite ground coffee. Plus, it saves money in the long run.

I've found that Keurig machines are perfect for busy mornings when I need coffee quickly. They're also great for offices or homes where people have different coffee preferences. Just remember that like any coffee maker, the quality of your coffee matters as much as the machine itself.",1,1752961241.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

**Birds Chirping, Sheets Rustle**

Good morning, lover…. *Kiss*

You’re so warm… we should stay in bed a little longer…

You like waking up to me… I can arrange for kisses every morning… *Kiss*

Don’t worry… I already turned off your alarm like twenty minutes ago. You just looked so peaceful I couldn’t bear to see you get woken up by a screeching alarm clock morning. So I just kept kissing you until you woke up!

Why do you suddenly look so worried, come on, lay back down with me.

Relax… it’s Sunday… you’ve got too much work on the brain…

Wait… what!? 

**Sheet Rustle, iPhone Swipe**

Oh no!

**Time Lapse**

**Rummaging Sounds**

Honey I am so sorry! I totally thought it was Sunday! I promise, I will get everything ready so you aren’t late for your presentation! You just get into the shower and I’ll make sure that your suit is all ironed and ready for you!

**Shower Running, Turn Off**

Hey! I finished ironing your suit and tie! How hungry are you feeling? I was scrolling through pinterest and I was looking through some different things that I could make for y–...

*Sniff Sniff* Do you smell something burning…?

No! I swear I haven’t even been into the kitchen yet!

Eeep! No no no no! I turned off the iron, I did… I turned it off and laid it on the tie so the heat would iron it…

**Running** Uhh… at least it wasn’t your suit jacket…? **Nervous Chuckle**

***TimeLapse***

***Coffee Maker Humming***

Okay… I promise I will buy you a new tie…

I think I still have it bookmarked so hopefully I can get the exact same one…

Baby, it’s not just any tie! It’s the one I got you when you were going for your last promotion! It’s your lucky tie!

It’s your lucky tie to me! What if I gave you seven years of bad luck by burning it the day of your presentation!

**Deep Breathes** Okay, you’re right… I’m freaking myself out… 

At least I can’t screw up the coffee… unless the machine suddenly breaks down…

You’re right… I shouldn’t joke about that… not today…

**Pours Coffee** Two creams two sugars?

**Stirring, Cup Set Down**

Here you go! So, any idea what y— *spittake, shocked gasp*

Did you just spit your coffee at me…?

Taste it…? What do you mean… I know the coffee didn’t… go bad or something. 

**Sip** Eww… why does it taste so… salty…? 

Oh no…

**TimeLapse**

**Sizzling Food** Shhh, I’m focusing…

I have screwed up every part of your morning. I'm at least walking you out of here with a full and happy stomach if it’s the last thing that I…

Okay… I’ve triple checked that there are no shells in the eggs. The stove top is on… I’m going to make something super simple…

Just some over easy eggs, bacon and toast… no one can screw that up, right?

I mean… there’s tons of ways… every element of this breakfast can be burned… I can break the yolks of the eggs, I can turn the bacon into glass, I can burn the toast black…

And that’s definitely going to happen if I don’t keep any eye on things!!!

Whew… okay… I… think I put the eggs in a bit early… your bacon is gonna be a little less crispy than you like it.

You don’t have to lie and say it looks good… the eggs are over cooked, I broke the yolk on one, the bacon is under done… the only thing I managed to cook was toast… that I forgot to get out of the pan!!!

Ohhh… hope you like your toast dark… *Sigh*

**TimeLapse**

*Solemnly* – Here’s your briefcase…

I’m sorry I just… I couldn’t have made this a worse morning before such an important day for you…

I turned off your alarm, I torched your lucky tie, I put salt in your coffee and possibly made the worst breakfast known to man kind… 

People in caves made better breakfasts than me this morning with a full modern kitchen…

Well… I put some money in your case… get some coffee and a sandwich on your way in.

How can I not look down…?

You aren’t mad…? Not even a little…?

If I was perfect, life would be boring? Even on a stressful day like today I made you smile…?

I… love you just the way you are too. Go get 'em, you got this.

And don’t worry… I won’t cook a celebratory dinner… we'll eat out. *Giggle, Kiss*",1,1752961233.0,ASMRScriptHaven,0,1.0,False

Ever been hooked by a fishing hook before? Most of the time, you don’t even know it’s there until you see it, stuck right into the back of your hand, leg, wherever else it decides to latch on.

Time to time I think I feel one of those hooks latching onto my right arm and it puts me in a panic every time. I get nightmares of being taken away by them, just pulled out the window and gone.

But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let me go back about 7 months ago.

My name’s Nathan. Back in early August, my grandfather passed away from heart failure at 73. In Newfoundland, that’s pretty rare. Most people don’t even make it that far before heart problems catch up with them.

He was more than just a grandfather to me. He was the reason I made it through a lot of tough times after my father left when I was just 8. He did everything in his power to keep my mom and me afloat and 20 years later, he was still supporting us in every way he could, never asking for anything in return.

Hell, the only reason I didn’t know what happened to him sooner was because he was on his way to celebrate with me. I’d just landed a new job I’d been working toward for months and he wanted to mark the occasion. He hopped in his old truck to grab a small cake, but he passed away at a red light before he could even get home.

He was one of a kind. Losing him felt like part of me was ripped out, leaving a massive hole. After his burial we did what we could to sell whatever he had. House, truck, tools, we just didn’t have space for it and it took some time to pull off, it also hurt a little giving up his things.

That’s when I found his old key ring. They weren’t for his truck, he never had spares for it, but to the cabin he used to own. In Newfoundland, cabins are common. People use them to escape for a while or, for some, to go moose hunting. My grandfather wasn’t much of a hunter, but he’d slip out there every now and then to get away. I remember a few times he took me there one of those trips was when he tried to teach me to drive at 16. That lesson ended quickly when I went just a little too fast and crashed his truck into one of the trees in the area. I’m pretty sure my mom yelled at him the entire day we got back but all he cared about was that I was fine in the end.

The cabin was about an hour outside of his home town, down a dirt road that barely even qualified as a road. You could easily miss it if you weren’t looking for it. It was in the perfect spot, just far enough away from everything, surrounded by trees for cover, but still close enough to the shoreline if you felt like fishing. And now, here I was, holding the only set of keys he had for it.

I didn’t tell my mother about the cabin even though now I wish I did. But at the time, I didn’t know if the cabin had been sold, given to one of us, or just left to rot. The urge to go there one more time before it was potentially taken away from us was stronger than anything else, I had to go.

The plan was simple: I told my mother I was going out of town to meet up with an old high school friend who was getting married soon, but also to clear my head from everything so far. I would be gone for 4 days, enough time to drive there, stick around for a day or two and then drive back without her knowing. She didn’t question it, I booked the time off and I headed out when the time came.

I overpacked of course. Instead of bringing just a few days worth of food and water, I ended up with 6 days worth of water and food. I also brought a fresh bottle of Screech and enough gasoline to keep the small generator my grandfather had up there running the entire time I was there. I did all of this in the next town over just to make sure my mother wouldn’t catch me packing supplies for the cabin.

Once I had everything, I hit the road. I didn’t stop until I reached that dirt road my grandfather had used for years. I’ve always hated that road, it was so bumpy it felt like I was getting whiplash every few minutes. My forgotten cold coffee didn’t stand a chance the moment I got on that dirt road, flying everywhere within the first few minutes and making a mess I couldn’t clean up until I was done getting to the cabin.

Even after all these years seeing the cabin still standing felt surreal. Its bright blue exterior stuck out against the surrounding trees. It wasn’t big, but that was part of its charm. All you needed in a cabin like this was a place to sit, cook, eat, sleep, and well...shit. Anything beyond that was an unnecessary luxury.

Behind the cabin, my grandfather had a small shed where he kept his tools and the generator that powered the lights and mini-fridge. The generator could run for about 10 hours, but I wasn’t planning on running it that long but if I did I brought enough gas to make it last, especially for some late night drinking.

I stepped up to the door, unlocked it and swung it wide open to let in the fresh air. Inside there was a small countertop on the right, enough space to prepare food, and a makeshift sink made from a cheap bucket and a couch to the side tucked into the corner of the cabin’s living room. No plumbing of course, we always had to bring our own water for drinking and washing. There was also a makeshift shower near the shed and an old outhouse a little further out which I had to spray down with bug repellent. The bathroom built in the cabin was nothing more than a seat with a bucket for those frigid winter nights if you didn’t want to freeze your ass off in the snow. No one used it as a bathroom honestly so we just used it as a small storage room.

The cabin only had four windows. One in the front, one in front of the kitchen sink and 2 small ones in the bedroom and bathroom. My grandfather didn’t keep much here, there was a small coffee table, a loveseat and two folding chair. The centerpiece of the cabin, though, was the old wood stove, which had probably been there longer than my grandfather. It was a sturdy and heavy wood stove with a flat top to boil your water for tea or cook any meal you wanted. He always preferred to cook on that thing then any electric stove top we brought even if it meant burning everything that touched it.

There was one other thing in the cabin I had to check though, one thing my grandfather showed me and told me to keep a secret even from my mother. Once you move the couch out of the way you could find two boards in the wall that stuck out from the others that were not nailed in but screwed into the wall. A quick twist with an old screwdriver and I had access to my grandfather’s rifle he had tucked away in the wall for safekeeping.

He knew all about Canadian gun laws and the need to keep ammo and weapons separate, but he didn’t care much for the rules. The rifle he owned wasn’t registered and it was an old Ross rifle, the same kind used by the Newfoundland military in World War 1. The fact that he had one and it still worked amazed me. ""It came with the cabin,"" he told me once, which made me question just how old this cabin really was. I knew the cabin had been fixed up a long time ago but old enough to last since World War 1? For now I just screwed the boards back on and left the rifle there, I had no reason to have it out right now and tucked the couch back in its place to hide it.

Once I was done inspecting the inside of the cabin and headed back outside to grab everything I packed, it was then it started to happen. I didn’t notice the hook hanging there dead center to the door when I was leaving and right away it sliced the right side of my face right on my cheek. It stung like hell and touching where it cut me I could already feel a small bit of blood on my finger tips. I wasn’t sure where it came from but I remember thinking to myself how much it would suck to leave just for a tetanus shot.

I grabbed the line that the hook was attached to, wrapping it around my hand, and gave it a tug, trying to pull it free from wherever it was tied to. But the more I tugged, the less sense it made. I figured it was probably attached to the wall or maybe even the roof for some strange reason but every time I pulled it felt a little to loose

Finally with one good yank I ripped it free, the long, nearly invisible line, dropped in front of me. It was much longer than it should’ve been. I could’ve easily wrapped it around the entire cabin without a problem. I figured it was just an extra bit of line left by my grandfather, or whoever had put it up, who hadn’t bothered to trim it down. I coiled it up, tied it off, and tossed it beside the front door for later. I’d deal with it properly once I was done unpacking the truck.

I was exhausted. I needed food and thanks to that damn hook, a band aid. Unpacking was quick, even setting up the gas generator my grandfather had was easy enough. Once everything was inside and the generator was roaring, I got to work cleaning up and eventually cooked myself dinner. When night rolled around and I was ready to sleep. As much as I wanted to stay awake a little longer my body was begging for a nap after being on the road for so long. So I slipped outside, turned off the generator for the night and headed to the cabin door.

As soon as I reached the door I spotted something at the very edge of my sight. It was pretty dark outside but I could have sworn I saw something at the tree line, so I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight mode, pointing it in the direction I saw whatever it was.

To my surprise I could make out what looked like a moose standing in the distance. Newfoundland is known for its moose population, there are so many now that they’ve become a real problem, especially for drivers. But this was the first time I’d seen a moose near the cabin like this. Now thinking about it, I think this was the first time I’ve seen any animal near the cabin and there was a full grown moose in the distance, maybe looking in my direction.

I quietly stepped inside, locked the door and brushed it off. I didn’t think much of it at the time. I was tired and my only focus was getting to bed to enjoy my time at the cabin for the next few days. I had a plan and no moose was going to stop me at this point.

The next morning I was still partly waking up when I went outside to grab some wood for the stove. I was already craving a cup of tea and as I made my way toward the back of the cabin I felt another sudden sting, this time from the top of my right hand. This one stung like hell. I think it was the jolt from it that made me jerk my hand away and made things worse as the hook poked through the other end of my skin. This one was a lot thicker compared to the first one that got me and it stung like hell.

Looking at the hook embedded in my skin only made the pain worse. I knew I had to break the line before I could do anything else and coiled it up a bit in my left hand to give it a tug, trying to pull it free.

Nothing.

In fact, it felt like the line was pulling back slightly as I tried again. I couldn’t figure out where it was tied, but I kept pulling thinking it was probably attached to the roof or something. It didn't take me long to realize the line wasn’t attached to the roof at all this time.

The line was coming from the sky.

For a second I convinced myself the wind must’ve blown it out from a tree or something. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, making it look like the line was hanging from the sky. But deep down I knew what I was looking at and I won’t lie, it scared the hell out of me.

I gathered all my strength and pulled on the line until it snapped much like the first one I found. This line was longer though. I didn’t waste any time and headed inside to grab my pliers. I needed to cut the hook off thanks to the barbed end it had, if I just pulled it out it would just rip through my skin more than anything, but with the hook being thicker this time it took a bit out of me to just cut it in half. I did thankfully, pulling both pieces out and throwing it into the trash.

I wasn’t sure whether I should get it checked out. It was a pretty big hook and who knew how long it had been there? But I also did want to just leave and waste an entire day getting it checked out either. I decided to check my phone and see if I could find a quick answer. Instead I was greeted with no signal, forgetting I was in the middle of the woods where it would be pure luck to get one out here.

I walked all around the inside of the cabin for the smallest signal at first before heading outside, checking every spot near there for anything before finally finding one spot that worked. It was just outside the kitchen window when I spotted the small signal bar pop up and allowed me very slow access to the internet again.

I must have been out there for a little while looking for some kind of quick answer when something caught my eye and nearly jumped out of my skin when I noticed it finally, just barely catching my phone in the process.

About 20 to 30 feet from the cabin, there was a moose, maybe the same one from the night before. It was standing motionless in the thicker part of the trees, just staring in my direction. What really shook me though was how quiet it was.

If you’ve ever seen a moose, you know how loud they can be. These massive animals are hard to miss, especially where the trees are packed together in places. A moose moving around will always make some noise. But this one? It was dead silent.

Something kept telling me in the back of my head that something wasn’t right, something about this moose just felt off as I made my way to the corner of the cabin, my eyes locked on it as I did. The moment I reached the corner I was greeted with something else, another hook. This one thankfully caught the sleeve of my shirt as I tried to walk away. My immediate instinct was to pull away, let it tear through my shirt and just not worry about it, the moment I did I watched as the hook came free before suddenly being pulled straight up into the air and out of sight. I didn’t know what I just saw at first and just stood there trying to see where it went. 

Where it went was up into the sky.

It must have clicked in my head shortly after because when it did I bolted to the cabin door. Something wasn’t right about this cabin suddenly and my first reaction to it all was getting the fuck out of there. I wasn’t going to stick around and find out what the hell was going on, I was going to leave and find out later if I could. I raced back inside and grabbed one of the empty bags I had brought with me, packing it with whatever I could without any real knowledge of what I was grabbing. I was more spooked by this than I thought I was now thinking about it, but god I wished I moved a little faster when I started.

I didn’t even care about the generator. I figured I would leave it, let it run itself out of gas and the problem solved .The need to go back there and shut everything down properly was being overrun by the need to simply leave. I was nearly done packing the bags when I heard it, the kitchen window shattering into a thousand pieces. Glass and wood was thrown into the cabin so suddenly I thought something had exploded behind me, making me jolt away from the sound before turning to it.

The damn moose was there, I knew it was because the moment I looked toward the window I could see just the smallest piece of its antlers poking inside before it pulled it back outside. Before I could react I heard another window smash, then another. For whatever reason the moose outside had smashed almost all of the windows and yet I still could not hear anything from it, not a single step.

""Fuck this,"" I remember muttering to myself.

I shoved the couch out of the way with all my mite and kicked the wall where the boards hid it, shattering them with one good kick. If I had to kill a moose to get out of there then god damn it, that’s what I was going to do.

I grabbed the rifle and grabbed one of the already loaded clips for it. Loading the rifle was difficult but I managed in the end, pulling the slide back then forward again to get it ready. I haven’t used it that much but my grandfather showed me how to properly use it before, nothing changed since then.

I figured if the moose was anywhere it would be near the shed, it did smash out the bedroom and bathroom windows which were close to it so that was where I would check first. With the butt of the rifle to my shoulder i swung the front door open and made my way towards the back end of the cabin. As I got closer I could finally start hearing it or something at least. Something banging on the other side. With a loud pop and bang I realized what it was. The moose was slamming its head into the generator and had killed it. Why the hell it was doing that I had no idea, but I knew I had to act fast.

Reaching the corner of the cabin I was finally in sight of the damn thing but god do i wish I never did now. The moose, this hulking beast of an animal stood tall over the now dead generator, raising its head up high now that it was done beating it to death before slowly turning its head towards me.

One of its antlers had snapped off at the base from repeatedly slamming it into the generator, leaving just a sharp stub sticking out of its head. But that was nothing compared to the rest of the sight.

Its fur was patchy, missing in some places, revealing pale raw skin beneath with spots of rot and decay. The moment it had turned its head towards me I could see a part of its lip was hanging loose, bits and pieces of it torn up and with old blood gunk up. And it’s eyes, god those nearly pure white eyes staring blankly back at me as it stood there.

This moose had been dead for some time now and holding it up were hundreds, maybe thousands of these hooks and lines scattered all across its body, suspending it upwards like a puppet with its feet never actually touching the ground, only looking like it was even on the ground to begin with. All of these super thin lines shot straight up into the air like all of the other ones I had seen by then, controlling every movement this moose made. No wonder it looked off to me when I first spotted it.

I stood there frozen, rifle aimed at the abomination before me, its hollow eyes met mine and in that moment, time felt like it stopped. My breath was trapped in my chest, my hands cold as ice as I held that rifle. I squeezed the trigger before I even understood what was going on and watched as the round landed right into the thing's right eye with a small wet pop before exiting the other side, a small bit of old gunk up blood pouring out where the eye once was. There was no reaction, no twitch, no flinch, nothing. It simply stood there, unfeeling, unaffected by the shot that would have killed most mooseI. I reacted by cocking the gun, pulling then pushing the slide back in place to ready another round as it kept its dead sight on me. The next round hit its rib cage, a small splatter of blood but no exit wound this time as I cocked the rifle yet again.

The best way I can explain how this thing moved is again like a puppeteer simply swung it towards me, lunging forward and forcing myself to jump back out of its reach as it slammed into the corner of the cabin. It bounced off the corner of the cabin like some crazed marionette, its movement odd and awkward at the same time as the hooks attached to it guided it back my way. In my moment of panic I walked quickly backwards, trying to get the rifle up fast enough to take another shot as the gun let out another snap

The bullet hit the rotten piece of the moose's back and I watched as it tore a large chunk off and shot straight up into the sky like trash caught in high winds. The amount of lines and hooks that went with it must have off-balanced the thing, shifting its weight to the side as it once again rammed into the cabin wall with an unsettling force where it paused for a brief moment. I remember my hands were shaky but not enough for me to cock the rifle one more time. The moment the next round was ready I watched in horror as this massive dead beast was simply pulled up into the air and out of sight. It was simply gone.

I frantically looked everywhere for that thing, unsure if it was just gone or waiting for me to fuck up and surprise me. It took me a bit but I considered everything in the cabin a lose as I made a mad dash for the truck, rifle in my left hand while right hand dug in my pocket for the keys, panic making everything so much harder to find them. I had just barely managed to pull the keys free when it returned.

It plummeted from the sky like some sort of twisted Ferris wheel, crashing into the side of the truck with a deafening impact. The impact drove the truck nearly seven feet to the side with enough force to almost flip it on to its side, I was mere inches away from it when it hit the door, forcing me to leap back and fall on my ass before stumbling back to my feet again.

The moose was barely unrecognizable. Both of its shattered antlers were almost nearly gone at this point and the remnants of its skin clung to its body in patches, revealing broken bones, exposed ribs and rotting flesh. Fragments of its skull and ribcage jutted from its body like broken shards of glass.

I tried to raise my rifle once more but before I could fire it was on me. The force slammed into me, pushing me backward until my back crashed into the cabin window and shattering the glass in an instant. The rifle slipped from my hands, and in that brief moment of disorientation, I struggled to catch my breath. There was no time to think, no time to plan, no time to wait. I did the only thing I could, I ran back inside. I sprinted back inside my heart pounding and reached the makeshift sink as the creature crashed into the door. It hit with such force that the wood exploded, splintering and cracking as it attempted to force its way inside. The only way for me to explain the situation was like watching someone control a puppet and trying to make them walk into a small house where the strings could get into, making parts of its limbs just drop and act dead on the spot as the lines attached to it dug into the wood. It struggled to get inside for a while before becoming lifeless, dead in its spot. It didn’t take long before all of the hooks and line attached to the corpse dragged it back outside and straight up in the air once again, not a sound to be made.

The best way I could describe what I was witnessing was like watching someone manipulate a puppet trying to force it to walk into a tiny house, the strings tangled and got caught in the roof and ceiling, causing parts of the puppet’s limbs to suddenly go limp and hang dead as the lines pulled tight against the wood. It struggled for a while, trying to force itself inside but eventually it went completely still, lifeless, frozen in place like a real corpse. It didn’t take long before the hooks and strings that had been attached to its body yanked it back out, lifting it up into the air without a single sound.

I stood there in silence overlooking the chaos that was left behind by this thing, splattering of old rotting blood, small bits and pieces of fur and flesh along with scattered wood and glass from the window and door. My breath was fast, still catching up to everything that happened moments before the silence as I took a few steps forward to look outside. I kept a bit of distance from the doorway still, giving myself enough space in case it came back with another surprise attack as I scanned the area. There was nothing, just dead silence.

That silence lasted only a moment before a loud and sudden *BANG* echoed from outside the cabin as a round from the rifle went off and ripped through the wall beside me before ending up inside the kitchen wall on the other side. Wherever the corpse went it had taken the rifle straight up with it before hitting the ground with such force to set off the loaded round live in the chamber. Won't lie, I think I pissed myself from that honestly.

After both near death experiences I ran to the couch and shoved it in front of the front door before grabbed the old bed and propping it up against the window as well, blocking any sight of that beast if it was to come back before tucking myself into the very corner the couch was in before all of this. It was the safest place in my mind, furthest from the windows and door leading outside where that thing could potentially get me.

I was stuck in this cabin.

I didn’t dare to try and leave as the hours dragged on, day became night and I risked it to get to the wood stove to light it up, giving me some better vision of the area around me inside the cabin. I barely moved, stunned by everything that had led to this as the realization I was stuck here started to leak into my mind. There was nothing I could do but sit here and wait, waiting for something to happen as I made the bottle of Screech my only friend in this world now.

My truck was completely fucked after what that thing did to it and it was the only safe way for me to get out of this place. I couldn’t just run away with a corpse like that flying around here to pounce when it was time, plus how many of those hooks were outside as well? I only bumped into a few of them and all I know they could be anywhere. I was stuck here. I must have drank half the bottle that night, pausing every moment I heard something outside or mumbling to myself about things long past. Did my grandfather know about this? What was controlling that thing outside attacking me? Should I leave a message in case someone finds me? I had so many thoughts running through my mind as I sat there, the glow of the wood stove lighting the room around me as I checked my phone for the time. I don’t remember much in that moment being piss drunk, but seeing my phone somehow gave me the idea of calling for help. I had to shake my drunken mind away and really think of how I was going to pull this off. If I could get a single 911 call out maybe, just maybe I could get someone here to save me. It was a long shot but it was the only shot I had, the only real problem was getting a signal. I knew where I could get even a small one, but that's what made it so much worse to think about it. It was my only chance to get out of here and I had to at the very least try.

My body felt heavy, exhausted even the more I tried to get myself up off the floor, a plan set in stone but unsure if I can even pull it off. Out the kitchen window was all I needed to reach out to, that was all I had to do. I can pre-dial the number and wait until i got a signal before pressing ‘Call’ on the phone to try and contact someone to help, but the more I looked towards the shattered kitchen window the more fearful I became, frightened of that thing just being around the corner and hitting when I was at my weakest.

My hands were shaking as I got the phone ready, only 10% power left was enough to get a phone call out as I dialed in the number. I kept my thumb over the ‘Call’ button on the screen as I crept up to the window and slowly stretched my right arm little by little outside of the wrecked frame. I kept scanning the area, keeping an eye out for the corpse to return and attack me as I reached further and further outside. My hope was fading pretty quickly the further i stretched myself out that window, trying not to cut myself on the glass until I saw it, a green signal bar popping up on the top right of the screen as I press ‘Call’ on the screen. The relief that overcame when I heard the sound of the phone ringing was like a rush, but only for a moment.

The phone slipped from my grasp as a surge of pain coursed through me intense and blinding, as though every nerve ending in my arm was being pulled and twisted. I looked down in horror to see hooks anchoring into my skin, spreading from my shoulder all the way to my fingertips piercing deeper with each pull. Instinctively I tried to wrench myself free, but the hooks resisted, tugging me back with a violent force instead. If my left arm hadn’t been braced against the cabin, I would’ve been dragged right out, pulled into the dark with no hope of escape. The pain was so overwhelming that for a moment I thought I might collapse from sheer agony. 

The pain was unbearable, it felt like I was being ripped apart little by little. Even though I was fighting for my life something in my mind shifted from being frightened to fighting back. I wasn’t going to be some puppet, dragged away and strung up like that damn moose, I was going to get away from this one way or another. With every ounce of strength I had I started to pull with all my might, intense pain jolting through me more and more as I pulled but I couldn’t stop.

I managed to get my foot up on the wall for leverage, giving me extra strength to work with as I started to pull with everything I had. I yanked myself back inside, my body slammed against the floor and came to a stop in the corner where the couch once was as my breathing became ragged, exhaustion taking over me as I laid there.

As the adrenaline started to fade that’s when I felt the full force of the pain.  I had to pull myself up with my left arm before seeing my right arm shredded to pieces. Strips of skin were missing all the way from my shoulder to my fingers, on top of that I had pulled with such force I lost the top of my middle finger and my ring finger, only half of them remained. Blood was rushing with the beat of my heart and as my heart rated increased I had to do what I could in pure agony

The moment was a blur to me, a bad panic of trying to stop the bleeding while thoughts of bleeding out ran through my mind. What I do remember was one idea of just pouring the remaining bottle of Screech over the wounds and shoving my arm into the wood stove, burning the wounds closed to stop the bleeding, but even I knew that was a terrible idea and would have only made more problems. Instead I must have just wrapped it up the best I could and poured I think what was rubbing alcohol all over the cloth I used which turned out to be a bed sheet and a t-shirt before passing out from that alone. Time was a blur at that point. I remember laying on that floor for a long while, other times I remember struggling to open and cook canned and bottle goods I brought with me. I think I even wrote a letter to my mother at one point fearing that I wasn't coming out of this alive. I didn’t think I was at that time. The final night I do remember pretty clearly. The pain in my right arm started to get worse as I laid there may be either half dead or half asleep. The fire in the wood stove had died out and the only thing I could hear was the rustling of the trees from the wind outside. I was ready for death to take me as I laid there but the longer I waited the more light I started to notice. I thought I was hallucinating when this all happened, it wasn’t until I heard the officers voice yell out before coming inside.

Before I knew it I was waking up in a hospital bed, the lights nearly blinding me when I finally woke up. The RCMP officer who spoke to me in the hospital explained that my 911 call did get through. They heard a struggle on the line, but the call dropped before they could track it down properly. They had only a vague idea of where the cabin was, which is why it took them so long to find me. But they found me, just in time.

I told them everything. The hooks, the moose, the damage to my arm, everything. I’m not sure if they believed me but they knew something had happened. The doctors said I was lucky I didn’t bleed out from how much was torn away on my arm. The doctor probably didn’t buy my story either, but that didn’t matter. All he needed to do was help me recover.

I stayed in the hospital for a while. I was too terrified to leave and was convinced that whatever attacked me was still out there. My fear kept me in that sterile room an extra day or two, even though I was physically well enough to go. It wasn’t until my mother insisted I leave that I finally agreed in hesitation and I went to stay with her for a few more days before heading back to my own home.

It's been 7 months since then. 

Writing all of this down has been difficult and doing what I just did was even harder. Part of me wants to believe it was just some twisted figment of my imagination, a way for my mind to shield me from what really happened. But I know what I saw.

The hardest part? I can’t prove any of it anymore.

The cabin is gone.

I just returned from driving out there, hoping for any shred of evidence that it was real. But when I got there it was gone. No remains, no pieces of the cabin, just nothing. It was as if it had never existed. I called everyone in the area and no one knew anything about it, not even the RCMP, who’d investigated the site days after they found me. According to them, the cabin should still be there.

But it wasn’t.

The only thing I found was a single, small fishing hook, tightly tied to a frail line.",1,1752961028.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I’m planning to give our first floor a little makeover to surprise my mom and brighten up the space. 🥰

The current setup:
We have a combined living and dining area (everything in one room).
These pieces have to stay:
	•	the couch (unfortunately – more on that below)
	•	the new TV unit
	•	the sideboard in the dining area
	•	the dining table

Why keep them?
My budget is super tight, and most of these items are either new or nearly new – it would be a shame to get rid of them.

What’s bothering me:
The couch is black, and it really weighs the room down. I’d love to create a lighter, cozier vibe – any ideas on how to make the black couch work better in the space?

I’ve tidied up and photoshopped out a few things that didn’t belong in the shot (like our old TV stands that will be thrown out soon), so don’t mind the “emptiness” in some corners. 😅

What I will replace:
	•	dining chairs
	•	coffee table
	•	rugs
	•	decor

What I need from you:

Was at the park alone the other day and a group playing volleyball invited me to join. A few folks were trans, and everyone was super welcoming and laid back.

We laughed, missed some shots, and ended up just chatting after the game. It was a nice, easy way to spend the afternoon.

Would love to meet more people from the trans community to hang out with volleyball, coffee, whatever. feel free to say hi.

Trans joy is real. And it’s beautiful. 🏐🏳️‍⚧️💛

1m47oxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/comments/1m47oxg/who_i_think_should_be_the_dcu_batman/,Who I think should be the DCU Batman,"At the end of the day, fancasts are subjective, mixed in with some objectively good logical points mixed in between. Regarding my fancasts, I personally look at acting skills first and foremost, followed by the availability of the actor, the chemistry, budget, and finally, looks. Which is what landed me on a DCU Batman fancast: Ethan Peck.  


1. **Acting chops:**  
Ethan Peck is an amazing actor with hella range. He's been nominated for 7 awards and won 2 of them. He's also currently playing Spock, who's similar to Batman regarding them both being cold, calculated strategists with an often dry sense of humor. What sold me on him as Batman was his ""I do not drink coffee. I only drink tea"" scene, plus the chess scene. Plus, Ethan has a deep authoritative voice as Spock, which is close enough to challenge Kevin Conroy's voice (And I don't say this lightly).

2. **Availability:**  
Sure the Star Trek series is still going on, but Ethan isn't at that level of fame that he can be booked for multiple projects at once. Look at Karl Urban for example. He's part of the Mortal Kombat cinematic universe as Johnny Cage, while already playing Billy Butcher, or Jack Quaid, who's Superman in MAWS, and Hughie in The Boys. So Ethan being part of two universes shouldn't be an issue. Plus, he wants to do the role as well.

3. **Chemistry and Budget:**  
Ethan isn't really well-known in the acting community, but he's friends with David Corenswet, so if he's cast, the ""Batman-Superman chemistry"" in the comics will be easier to execute. Plus, he's not exactly a big name, so he'd be pretty easier and economically healthier to cast.

4. **Looks:**  
Ethan is the grandson of Gregory Peck, on whom Bruce Wayne's appearance was based off of for Year One and Kingdom Come, and he resembles him. He's 6'1"", which is only slightly shorter than Batman's comic height of 6'2"", which can be solved by slightly taller boots, and he won't get dunked on by David Corenswet (who's 6'6"" according to his trainer). Speaking of, Ethan can get bulked up as well to match or be close to David Corenswet's physique. He's also slightly older than David by 7-8 years as of right now, so add in filming time and time of movie release, and Ethan will be 42-43 years old, which is Batman's age when the Grant Morrison comic run happened in-universe. Plus, he's a black belt in karate.

In hindsight, I fully trust Gunn's casting choice when the project comes about, but what do you people think?",0,1752960843.0,batman,3,0.33,False

I decided on the Lelit Elizabeth, eureka mignon turbo, acaia pearl scale, normcore tamping kit. 

We got beans from a local roastery and I just dialed in the settings this morning and have been trying to pull shots and practice. 

I have a lot of culinary training and tea making experience, but never really deep dived into coffee and espresso. So excited to start this journey! 

This is the 7th shot I pulled after trying to dial everything in and the best shot so far I think, before stopping and taking a break. Please let me know if it looks okay! Do I need to grind finer is the flor good? Would love insight for improvement. (Couldnt upload the video only the images :( so just a picture of the shot)

1m47o8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m47o8o/theres_something_underneath_my_basement/,There's Something Underneath My Basement,"((Another story that I had posted on NoSleep, one of the first few I started writing a few months back.

Like the others I figured it would be fun to post it here so I hope you all enjoy!))

My name is Alex and as I write this, I know it’s only a matter of time before the RCMP find me. And when they do, they're either going to question me about why I burned my house down or take me, probably both honestly.

Right now I’m held up in the nearest hotel, not planning on going anywhere. I have barely slept and I don’t think I'm going to get much more sleep going forward.

They’re going to want answers and the truth is, I don’t have any good ones, none that makes any sense anyway. Hell, I don’t understand what happened myself. Their gonna think I’m insane or something but they can go look for themselves once the fire dies down and they can look down in that fucking hole in the basement.

Besides, how do I explain to them that I found another house beneath my basement?

It all started a couple of weeks ago when I found a property for sale while driving around. In this market, you don’t expect to find anything remotely affordable anymore, let alone a full house for $50,000. That alone should’ve raised red flags, but it didn’t. I was too caught up in the price so much that nothing else mattered to me.

There was no online listing, no real estate agent, nothing. Just an old wooden sign staked in the front yard: *FOR SALE* scrawled in fading red paint, with a phone number beneath it. I called. The man who answered sounded old and told me it was for sale for $50,000. I bought it on the spot and spoke with him a little longer to arrange a day to purchase it.

I should’ve known something was off from the start. But I didn’t, or maybe I did and chose to ignore it. I don’t know anymore.

It was tucked away near the end of an old, half-forgotten road where barely anyone lived anymore. The distance between each house made fences kind of pointless unless you REALLY needed privacy, just empty land with thin, scattered trees that looked more dead than alive. There were more shadows than people out there somehow.

The house itself was small. Tiny really, especially by modern standards. A little paperwork, a quick money transfer and suddenly, I was a homeowner. Well “new” owner at least. The place was old and worn, but I didn’t care. It was my house now. 

The man selling it was in his seventies, maybe older. Pale, wrinkled, like someone who hadn’t slept properly in months. He said he was heading to the East Coast to live with his family somewhere in Labrador. He told me his wife had passed away just a few months earlier. Found her one morning in the back garden. Dead, just lying there in the grass. He didn’t say how she died and I didn’t press him for details.

It wasn’t exactly the comforting image you want burned into your mind when buying a house, but still I had the deed and for the first time in my life, I owned something that wasn’t some shitty apartment I was renting for more than what it was really worth.

That night I drove over to pick up the keys from him. It was already late well past sunset and the road leading to the house was barely lit. Only a single streetlamp buzzed weakly near the edge of the property, casting just enough light to see the outline of the porch. The rest of the house was drowned in darkness. No lights on inside. Not even a glow from a window, just blackness inside.

The front door was slightly ajar hanging open like someone had left in a hurry. On the porch, right in front of the doorway the keys were sitting on the ground. No note or anything.

I bent down to pick them up and the moment my fingers touched metal something came rushing out towards me from the house, nearly knocking me to my ass from jumping back so quickly.

It was the old man.

He rushed out the front door fast, faster than I thought a man his age could move and walked straight past me without a word. Not even a glance in my direction. He had this wide, unsettling smile stretched across his face like he just did something wrong and got away with it. It was unnerving the way he smiled.

He didn’t stop either. He didn’t turn back to look at me or anything, just kept walking until he reached the other side of the road and kept walking further and further until he was out of sight in the darkness.

I stood there on the porch, keys in hand, trying to process what I had just watched until I couldn’t see the old man at all. I had no clue what was in that direction at all, an uneasy feeling overtaking me even when I glanced back to the house again with its front door wide open now, the pitch blackness inside haunting in its own way.

What got me the most was how tall the old man looked that night. He seemed taller than I remembered him being when we first met, almost unnaturally so. Maybe it was the night playing tricks on me or maybe it was just the sheer unease of that moment, the sight of him rushing past grinning ear to ear in the dark, that had scared me more than anything at the moment when I saw him rushing past me. I never saw him again.

It took a few days before I was fully moved into the house. There were the usual chores of changing the locks, bringing in the essentials, trying to make the place feel like mine by placing furniture and photo’s everywhere. It may have looked small from the outside, but the house had a deceptive amount of space. Two modest bedrooms, a cramped kitchen, a tight but functional living room, and even a pull-down ladder that led to a shallow attic you had to crouch in to move around. But what really surprised me was the basement. The stairs creaked with each step you took but they led down into a massive, open space about the size of the entire footprint of the house above it. It was dark, musty, and smelled faintly of damp stone and old wood, but it had potential.

Like the rest of the place, it needed work. The exterior was in rough shape, yellow paint flaking off in long strips, roofing shingles cracked and curling in spots, the kind of damage that only years of sun, wind and neglect would do to them over time. Still, with how little I spent on the place I had enough saved to start making improvements. I wanted to build something for myself finally.

It was only two days ago that everything changed.

It had been raining hard all day, the kind of steady yet heavy, cold rain that soaks through everything it touched. I was heading down into the basement to grab a toolbox when I noticed nearly two feet of water at the bottom of the staircase.

I looked around for the source, expecting to find a burst pipe or a window left open, but there was nothing I could see that was letting the rain water in.

I scrambled to collect the buckets, pans, even plastic bins, anything I could use to start scooping water into to help fight the rising water. I’d scoop up what I could, run it outside, and toss it far from the house, only for the water level to rise again when I came back. It was a losing battle yet I had to keep trying, the last thing i needed was my entire basement filled with water and reach the top of the staircase..

On my sixth trip down there, something gave.

As I was rushing to the bottom of the stairs I heard a sound, a deep, hollow like sound, like wood giving way under pressure. Then, all at once, the water began swirling, spiraling toward the center of the basement like in a sink once the plug was pulled. It drained quickly, all of the water rushing downwards until all of it was gone, leaving behind a single hole dead center in the basement.

It was no bigger than my fist  right in the middle of the floor. I waited for the last of the water to vanish before approaching it with caution. My first thought was it was an old floor drain. Maybe it had been blocked for years and finally gave way once there was enough water down here, but when I shined my phone’s flashlight into it that idea died pretty quickly.

There was no pipe, no grating, no rusty metal or broken pipe, just a black void in the center of my basement floor. The dirt and cement around the edges were rough yet round at the same time, maybe a collapse but it was level with the floor somehow.

The closer I got to it to look, the weirder it started to get.

With my phone’s flashlight, I could just barely make out what looked like... another floor beneath me, far far below. Was it a second basement? Another room? I had no clue what the hell I was looking at at that moment.

I wanted to know more. I *needed* to. But making the hole bigger was a risky move. If the foundation was as old and brittle as the rest of the house, I could bring the whole damn floor out from under me, hell I could even make the house collapse over me. Okay maybe not that last bit but you get my point.

At the same time there was absolutely nothing I could do at the time being. The rain water was gone thankfully but until tomorrow no one was going to be swinging by and checking it out for me, not until tomorrow at least.

Worst case scenario, I figured I could grab a piece of plywood, cover the hole, and pour concrete over it, that would seal the damn thing off and pretend it was never there. Not a perfect fix but at least it would keep the basement from collapsing under me…hopefully.

When the morning came I stepped outside to inspect the house for any more damage from the storm before finally making my way back down to the basement. I was expecting the hole to still be there. What I wasn't expecting was the hole to be much bigger now overnight.

What was once the size of my fist was now easily large enough for a grown man to jump through. No digging or tools required for the job, just a clean, dark opening in the middle of my basement floor. Looking down into it again I could finally confirm what I thought I’d seen the day before, a wooden floor much deeper down then I thought originally. There even seemed to be boxes down there as well

Even if I wanted to go down there the drop was too far. There was no way I’d be able to climb back up if I just jumped down there. Hell I would probably bust my leg up just jumping down there, the only way to safely reach the bottom was with a ladder. So I got one.

I drove to the nearest hardware store and bought the longest extension ladder they had, along with a decent flashlight, something stronger than what my phone's flashlight could handle. When I got back I carefully lowered the ladder into the hole, extending it as far as it would go until it finally touched the bottom. The very top of the ladder barely grazed the stone floor below. If the floor it leaned on gave out while I was climbing down I would for sure fall and probably break something along the way.

I took my time descending step by step, testing each one with my full weight before committing to the next. The moment my feet touched the bottom, I realized how strange the air felt. Warm and dry, too dry for a space underground that had just flooded.

I flicked my flashlight to look around the room, the shape of it was off somehow.

The wooden walls rose upward at a sharp angle, forming a triangular space that immediately struck me as familiar. I turned slowly as pieces started clicking in my head. “This looks just like my attic” I remember telling myself, only it was taller and almost thinner on the sides in a weird warped kind of way.

Even the boxes down here looked similar to the ones I had in the attic only stretched into more odd shapes. Inside the boxes though was nothing but crumpled up paper and old splintered wood that smelt like they were decaying for a while. It wasn’t long before i spotted the pull down staircase like in my actual house.

I hesitated at first before yanking it free and carefully descended once more, my flashlight flicking around in my hand as I stepped lower and lower into this house under my basement.

The darkness swallowed  me as I entered the hallway.

I was standing in what looked like my own living room, almost exact to my living room. Same furniture, same shitty worn down rug, the same family photos hanging on the walls. The photos were wrong though, stretched in a way that it was like someone editing them used a tool to stretch them taller and thinner without adjusting them to look right..

The pictures with myself in them scared me the most.

All of the photo’s with myself standing in them made me look off in so many ways, it was the only part of any of the pictures that looked proper within them, yet I look monstrous in them. I looked taller but thinner, my eyes wide and a huge grin smeared across my face in an almost impossible way. It scared me a little to look at them.

I moved toward the kitchen, stepping lightly as I did. The air felt still and heavy, it was like no one had been down here in ages yet everywhere I look things I had in my own house were place perfectly where I left them, the kitchen was a perfect sight of this with a plate and fork left in the sink, and a coffee pot left on the counter from this morning. The kitchen was just as distorted, tall counters and oversized cabinets. Two impossibly thin chairs that looked exactly like what I had but scaled like props in some surreal movie scene. I would have had to jump to sit on them and even then I’d probably snap them like twigs from doing it.

There were windows but instead of letting in light they were filled with dirt and stone, the dirt pressed right up to the glass. No sunlight could reach this far underground, but the lights overhead… they looked intact despite their oddly stretched design.

I stepped to one of the light switches and flicked them up.

For a split second  the bulbs flashed with an intense light, revealing just how wrong everything was. The sudden light flash made the bulbs pop loudly and killed them in an instant. Within that brief moment of light I thought I saw something at the end of the hallway leading into the living room.

The light was on and gone so quickly I couldn’t tell what it was, but it was tall, unbelievably tall as it stood there staring at me.

I quickly raised my flashlight down the hallway, the beam bouncing wildly off the walls. I could’ve sworn I saw something, someone even standing there. I froze, heart pounding, eyes locked on the place where it had been as my hands shook holding the flashlight. My mind raced to make sense of it, where the hell it even came from, but it came up empty. Panic started to creep in as I backed into the kitchen counter with my hand blindly searching for anything to use, it landed on the handle of a kitchen knife. It was long and thin, barely more than a glorified machete then a knife, but it was the only thing between me and whatever might be waiting on the other side of the hallway.

I stepped forward slowly, each foot step echoing too loudly on the warped wood. The silence was thick like the house itself was holding its breath as I moved through it. I inched my way to the end of the hallway, ready to fight whatever the hell was over there only to find nothing, nothing at all.

Did my eyes play tricks on me with the sudden flash of light?

I stood there for what felt like forever trying to calm myself, trying to make sense of what I’d seen while searching every inch of the living room for anything at all. There was nothing, nothing except for one more room in this messed up house.

The basement.

Every piece of me screamed at me to not go down. God only knows what the hell was waiting for me down there, yet I needed to see now, I had to see what was down there.

I took my time, descending the narrow staircase little by little. I reached the basement floor of the second house and there, right in the center of the basement floor was another hole. And this time a ladder was already in place. Almost identical to the one I had used earlier. As if someone, or something, had placed the same one for me. What if it was there because I placed my ladder to reach down here?

The hole was much wider than the last one as I stepped closer to it. It was wider yet the attic I was looking into this time was much shorter then this one, maybe shorter than the one I actually owned on top..

This time though, nearing the edge the smell hit me harder than anything else. The stink of rotting wood and something sour and organic, made my stomach twist and turn a little. I covered my nose with my sleeve and leaned over shining my light into the pit. The space below glistened under the beam. Everything looked wet, drenched in something thick that shimmered like oil.

Maybe this was where the rainwater had drained. But that didn’t make sense, this second house would have soaked it up before it even reached the basement, hell whatever was down there didn’t look like it was soaked in water at all, more slime or mold.

My curiosity got the best of me as I began climbing down, ignoring every desperate plea my brain tried to make me stop. This house, the third one, was the opposite of the last. Where the second house was tall and thin, this one was short and wide. I had to crawl on all fours just to move around down there and the smell, oh god the smell was so bad. The attic ceiling was pressed downwards, forcing me to crawl to the pulled up staircase before I was free from it.

The air was thick and wet down here, covering my face was out of the question now with my arms drenched in whatever the hell this was as everything had a thin layer of mold or slime or…whatever the fuck it was, making my steps a little more slippery. I was in the hallway now, forcing me to dip my head slightly to avoid hitting the low ceiling. The walls were stretched outward now, wide and bloated. Warped like something swollen from the inside.

Again everything was where it should’ve been to the layout of my actual house. My furniture, my photos. But this time the distortion wasn’t just in shape. It was *texture*. The air smelled of mildew and decay. the furniture sagged. The floor squelched slightly beneath my feet and the photos were awful. My face was bloated and discolored. My eyes were barely visible as the bloated parts of my face swelled over them like I was infected by something.

I made my way toward the final staircase, the one leading down to the basement and I heard it.

Breathing.

Slow, ragged, wet, a rattle of the throat like it was trying to clear something deep in its throat.

The sound grew louder with every step. It wasn’t just breathing, it was struggling with every breath it took like it was trying to stay alive. In a way it sounded like water was lodged in their lungs and every breath rattled it around in a sickening manner.

I descended carefully each step louder than the last, a slight squishing sound to go with them from the mold beneath my feet as I reached the bottom step, seeing the basement floor finally.

Someone or something was standing there, standing over what looked like another hole dead center to the basement.

It was hunched, shorter than me for sure. Its back was to me, looming over the other hole in the floor. Its body looked swollen and damp, its skin pale and blotchy, and its head  too big for its frame. The gurgled wheezing echoed off the walls as it shifted slightly.

Then it turned, its step made him jiggle just a little bit.

What I saw was…me, but it wasn’t me at the same time.

Its face was bloated and discolored, its eyes were barely visible as the bloated parts of its face swelled over them. Its mouth slack and drool hangs in thick strands from its bloated lips. Its shirt was identical to mine, soaked and clinging to its sticky body, its eyes barely registered my presence at first.

“What the fuck...” I whispered, the words barely escaping my throat as I looked at whatever the hell this was in front of me.

It let out a sickening noise, a cross between a gargled yell and a cough. Its whole body shuddered before it started to move towards me, moving faster than I expected it to move.

Each step made its bloated skin shake from its footsteps, the bloated parts nearly covering its eyes shifting to its weight and gravity.

My body told me to run, run and don’t look back, my boots slipping across the slime coated floors as I scrambled up the staircase in a mad panic to get away from it. The gunk clinging to the surfaces and making every step a risk, I could barely keep traction.

I launched myself onto the pull down staircase as fast as I could, dragging myself upward on all fours like a scared animal clawing its way out of a trap. Behind me I heard the wet, slapping sounds of it following, its hand reaching up from the pull down staircase leading to the attic already. I felt fingers swipe at my ankle, slick and sticky but they slid off just as I hauled myself forward and to the hole in the attic

I could hear my own heartbeat ringing in my ears, my body buzzed with adrenaline and a blind panic coursing through every nerve in my body. That thing, that twisted, bloated *version* of me was chasing me and somehow catching up. I didn’t dare to look back, not wanting to see that thing catching up to me in any way.

If I can get to my actual house and pull the ladder up, I could prevent it from reaching me, no way for it to be able to climb up that distance I hoped. I was in the second house now, out of breath but I could still hear it following me as I raced to the staircase, reaching the hallway once again and climbing up the pull down staircase again. I was nearly out of there as I stood in the attic for a second.

I grabbed the ladder and started to climb like a mad man, reaching only half way up the ladder before I felt its hand grab me by the leg.*.* The entire ladder lurched in my hands, its weight suddenly doubled from the thing joining me on it. It held on to my leg, trying to pull me down with it as I struggled to keep a grip on the latter, my hands still slick with the third floor's slop.

I didn’t stop to fight it. I ran. I sprinted across the attic floor to the next pull-down staircase, yanked it open, and threw myself onto the steps, climbing as fast as my legs would carry me. The wood groaned beneath my weight. My fingers slipped on the wet rungs. I could hear the creature scuttling after me, faster than anything that heavy and bloated should’ve been able to move.

His hands were cold and rubbery, coated in something viscous that immediately soaked through my jean leg. It yanked hard, trying to drag me back down with it. I tried to pull away, holding on to the ladder the best I could, my other foot flailing around and trying to get back on to one of the steps of the ladder. The thing below snarled, breath bubbling like it was choking on vomit as it finally spoke out words I could understand.

“*Deeper...* DEEPER\*!\*” it gurgled, its voice broken and wet like it was speaking through a throat full of sludge.

“Get the fuck off me!” I shouted.

I twisted violently trying to break free and kicked down with my free foot aiming blind. I struck the left side of its face, my foot nearly sticking to its face as I raised it up again and brought it down on him again and again.

“Deeper!” It screamed at me before my foot smashed it in the jaw, a loud crack coming from my foot smashing into it again. With one final kick I felt the left side of his face give, almost like a grape being stepped on as the skin cracked open underneath my foot and his grip suddenly loosened as it fell to the floor beneath with a wet splat like a water balloon. The entirety of the left side of its face was broken up, gushing out blood and whatever fluids was stored inside of its body as it poured out around it, its body twitching as it laid on the floor beneath me.Looking down at it, a part of me wanted to make sure it was dead. Instead I pulled myself up into my actual basement, pulling the ladder up with me to make sure nothing else could come climbing up.

I didn’t know what the hell to do. My mind was on fire, spiraling on what I just witnessed, trying to make sense of what I had seen, what I had just killed\*.\* There were no answers that made any sense, just more questions piling up and clawing at the edge of my sanity. But through the noise, one thought cut through with terrifying clarity. What if something else could crawl up here? It may have been the panic I was in, it might have been the thought of more fucked up versions of me could be lingering down there, but in the end i decided to burn the place down with whatever I had on hand.

If nothing existed up here then there shouldn’t be anything down there right? It mirrored my home in every way before twisting it and making whatever the hell I just saw down there. It was the only thing that seemed to make sense in my mind at that moment.

I tore through the house grabbing anything flammable. Paper, lighter fluid, cans of spray, I even thought about getting gas from the tank of my car to pour everywhere but I would need it to get the hell out of here. The smell of chemicals filled the air, sharp and burning my throat as I spread everything I had everywhere. I didn’t care about damage or cost or consequence anymore, this house was cursed with things I couldn’t understand

I stood in the center of the living room for a moment as I readied the matches, my fingers trembling to get one of them lit before throwing it down, flames shooting up everywhere very quickly before I rushed out the door.

As the flames rushed through the house I made my way out the front door that somehow was already wide open. I didn’t remember leaving the front door open at all but I shook that thought out of my head as I ran to the car, igniting the engine to get the hell out of there as flames engulfed the house. I let the house burn behind me, never once looking back at it as I drove as fast and I could out of there like a bat out of hell. Looking back it now I could have done so many different things like call the police and have them see the hole for themselves and whatever fucked up thing was down there waiting for them, but as it stands I could care less now. I should be upset with burning my home down but I don’t, I really don’t after all of that.

I’ve been at this cheap hotel ever since, holed up in a room that smells like old wallpaper and cat piss. I haven’t slept or eaten much, my stomach just turns whenever I think of the third house down there.

My mind keeps going back to when I found that…thing in the basement, it was looking at another hole dead center of the basement. There was another house down there, maybe more messed up then the third one and who knows how many more beneath that one.

What bothered me even more was the fact that the third house had a messed up version of me, was there one for the second floor or did I get lucky? I thought I saw something but I looked everywhere when I was down there and spotted nothing but what if I missed it somehow?

I don’t know. I’ll probably never find out now and honestly, maybe that’s for the best.

Anyway, I’m done writing about this. Just trying to keep my head on  straight while I wait for the RCMP to show up. They will come eventually.

This is a healer/sorcerer character I made named Soso(short for Espresso), they’re a coffee inspired character I made after not being able to sleep one night due to being over caffeinated lol.
I have a bit of a back story and idea for stats for them, like high level(I hope that’s right) stealth cause their liquid and can hide as someone’s drink, but not the best at negotiating or stealing due to being constantly hyper(which means stamina is pretty high too).

The kind of off you can feel in your bones — like a ghost sitting at the edge of the bed that no one wants to name.

Tonight, I confronted him.

Not aggressively. Not dramatically (ironically). Just: ""Hey, are you happy?""

And *boom*. The dam broke.

He told me he's been ""mentally checked out"" for months. That he doesn't think he ever really *wanted* what we have — not with me, not with anyone. That he feels like he's ""playing house"" and slowly dying inside. His words.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t cry. I just... stood up, grabbed my keys, and left. I’m sitting in a 24-hour diner right now, staring at a cup of coffee I haven’t touched, wondering how the hell I just lost the life I thought I had.

Here’s the kicker: a part of me feels *relieved*. What kind of monster feels relieved after being emotionally obliterated?

I don't know what comes next. I just needed to get this out because if I keep it in, I think I’ll shatter into pieces.

I research before traveling, so some are things I'd read and am reiterating, and some are things I wish I'd read.

•So happy we stayed at a rental home (with a pool) in Noord. Close to Tres Trapi for morning snorkeling and very quiet and private.

•Aqua Windie's was fantastic for snorkel kit rental. They set us up the afternoon before and brought out drone photos to show us where to see turtles and lots of fish. Get the flotation vests!

•I didn't feel good about ATVs and EZ Raiders were a fun alternative. Carlos was so upbeat and did his best to keep things light and moving for our moody teen. The sights were incredible—you should climb down into the cave pool if you get the chance—but three hours was a lot; we would've been okay with the shorter ride. Learn from me: keep your danged feet on the vehicle if you're feeling unstable—you don't want a tire burn.

•Wear a strong sports bra if you're doing a horseback ride. Ours liked to trot at times and my boobs took a beating. But it was magical. We booked directly with Rancho Notorious.

•Bring cash. Between tour guide tips, carrots for the horses/donkeys, $1 to use beach bathrooms (unless you buy concessions), and credit card minimums at the Asian grocery stores, you'll need it more than you might expect.

•Get to a snack hut and try every pastechi you can.

•Not cheap but the smash burger from Marea (in JOIA on Eagle Beach) was perfect. Lovely to take a break from the beach heat at the bar with a cold drink in the AC (and use a very nice bathroom).

•Eduardo's Hideaway is aces when you want to eat a little cleaner. We went a few times for smoothies, iced coffees, poke, energy balls, and breakfast tacos.

•Kamini's Kitchen blew our minds. Don't miss them.

•Diet Coke addicts will have to settle for Coke Zero. No Baja Blast at Taco Bell, either (sorry, moody teen).

•Bring water hammocks for pool/ocean (and water shoes with grip if you're going to the cave pool).

•Tourist zone wasn't our scene but we went one evening; I felt like I was inside a slot machine. Scratch Kitchen was fine and a calm, non-gimmicky dining option. Wanted to try the Gelatissimo Bus but the after-dinner line was insane.

•Aruba Aloe is everywhere and has lots of good gift options. Also bought local papaya hot sauce and Jumbo's chocolate bars (from Super Foods) to gift folks.

•Rented a car from Wheels 2 Go; very reasonably priced, provided transpo from/to the airport, and I think it only cost $.01 to add an extra driver.

•The outside airport wait is one you'll likely have to deal with. We flew on Monday afternoon and had to wait outside for maybe 30 minutes. There are sun shades, misters, and iguanas, though. :)
 
Hope this helps someone. It's a wonderful place with kind people and extraordinary nature! Have a great time!

I used to write all the time but stopped. The podcast has given me inspiration to get back into writing and since they inspired me I figured this would be an appropriate place to post my first story. I hope you enjoy. -C.S.

Sometime during the night of December 2nd, 1992, Sadie Carmine disappeared from her home. Her parents woke up to find that her bed was empty. The covers tossed aside, her imprint still in the mattress. The front door was wide open. 

A trail of footprints in the snow led from the Carmines’ front door straight into the woods. The prints could only be left by Sadie. She was barefoot and she was alone.

A search party was immediately assembled to look for her and I jumped at the chance to volunteer. We don’t have a lot of people in this small town but we look after one another. I grew up with Sadie’s dad, Robert. I love him and his wife, Angela. They are the family that I never had. They’re good people. I wanted to find his little girl.

The search party was organized by the chief of police. He assigned us our partners at midday and sent us on our way into the woods.We were to fan out into the woods in which she ran into. We were supposed to return when the Sun came down but I already was determined to stay out as long as possible to find her. The chief assigned us our partners at midday and sent us on our way into the woods.

I was paired with Nick Middleton. Nick’s a good guy but he talks too much for my liking. The search party fanned out soon after. We were in a big group for a while, crunching through the snow. The wind was biting cold, tearing into our insides and chilling us to the bone. The sound of our boots crunching into the blanket of snow that covered the forest floor echoed off of the trees. One pair broke off and went their own way, then another, then another until Nick and I were all alone. The woods were still. Not even a bird. The only sounds were our breaths, fogging out of our mouth in the cold air, and the crunch of snow and frozen leaves under our boots.

As we walked, I remembered the day the Carmines came home with Sadie. I was there to greet them and I was the first non-family member to hold her. From then on, we were family. Her little hands always grabbed my fingers and refused to let go. Her little laugh, her youthful joy. She was the perfect kid any parent would ask for. Now it was my job to bring her home.

A few minutes into our search, I saw Nick mark a tree we passed with something.

“What is that?” I asked.

“Glow-in-the-dark paint. So we don’t get lost,” he said with a smile.

I got to hand it to him, he came prepared.

We marched on further into the trees. Nick, as per usual, talking his way into oblivion with every passing step.

“Why would she leave? Chief said there was only one set of footprints. I just don’t understand,” Nick said as we took a break under a dead tree. I handed him my thermos of coffee with a shrug. He took it from me gratefully, taking a long swig. 

The truth is, I didn’t know what to say. Sadie was a well-behaved, polite kid. How would I know what compels an 8-year-old girl from a good home to run off into the frigid night?

Nick handed my thermos back to me as he wiped his mouth with the back of his gloved hand. 

“It’s too damn cold to be doing all this, I can tell you that much right now,” he said as he readjusted his hat. 

Without another word, we were moving again. Deeper into the forest we went, calling Sadie’s name as loud as we could. I knew that the lower the Sun got, it would get colder and colder. She wouldn’t last long out here in just her pajamas. I knew that. I wanted so badly to find her and get her back to her parents. I couldn’t bear to see the look on their faces if I failed them. 

An hour passed. 

Two. 

Three. 

Four. 

Nothing.

All of our shouting, all of our marching, didn’t get us any closer to finding Sadie.

“Stop man. Come on, let’s take a second to breathe,” Nick said, exhaustion and annoyance plain in his voice. 

“What?” I say, finally coming to a stop in front of him.

“We haven’t taken a break in forever. We will be no good to her if we die of exhaustion out here,” he said as he took a seat on a frozen tree stump. He breathed into his gloved hands and rubbed them together.

“If you’re tired, man, you can just go back. I can go alone,” I said to him. He produced a bottle of water from his bag and looked at me.

“I get it, Jodie, I really do. But, we have to stop. Maybe one of the other search duos found her already. We’re going to freeze to death if we’re not careful.”

“If we are at risk of freezing to death out here, then she doesn’t have much of a chance. When the Sun goes down, it may be too late for her. I’m going to keep moving.”

I turned away from him and continued my trek into the woods. I didn’t hear him say anything in response but I did hear his quick footsteps catch up to me and fall in tandem behind me. 

We could see the Sun sinking behind the trees. The light continued to drop.

“Hey,” he said behind me. “Why haven’t we seen anybody else out here?”

He was right. We HADN’T seen any other searchers for hours. Which wouldn’t be that shocking considering the huge amount of dense forest we were tasked with searching. What was shocking was the noise. Or rather, the lack of noise. Even in winter, these woods were a hub of wildlife activity. It was at that moment I realized that we hadn’t seen anything or heard a sound since we entered the threshold of the forest. I didn’t like it.

“Why haven’t we at least heard one of the other searchers call out her name? How far apart did we fan out?” Nick said, his voice wavering. 

The Sun was now under the horizon. It was dark. You don’t know what dark is until you’ve been in the woods. We pulled out our flashlights and ran the beams of light in front of us.

Trees. More menacing in the night. Silence. Until I heard it. Very faint. I strained my ears to listen more intently. I needed to make sure I heard what I thought I heard. And then it happened again.

Crying. A little girl’s crying. 

Nick clearly didn’t hear it.

“We’ve done all we can, Jodie. We need to get-”

“SHH!” 

He stopped talking and listened. A wail met our eardrums through the darkness. It was louder this time. It droned at us in the night. It was a single note. It, at first, sounded as it should. But then it started to change. The wailing began to mix with notes of other things, as if the sobs were coming from some kind of animal. A mountain lion?  It cried out into the void and then, all of sudden, the woods fell silent once again. If Sadie was making that noise, she did not appear within our flashlight beams.

“What the fuck?” Nick whispered. 

A chill went up my spine. All of a sudden, I was aware of the temperature around me. It was bitterly cold.

“Sadie?” I called out into the night.

Silence.

“Sadie??” I called out again, beginning to walk toward where the noise came from. 

I shined my flashlight in between two trees and was not greeted by another tree. A few more steps forward, more space in between the trees. I quicked my pace and came face-to-face with a clearing in the woods.

The moon was out, barely illuminating what was before us. In the dark, I could make out the silhouette of a building. It was sitting by itself. It had to have been about 100 yards from the treeline.

“I’ve never seen this before,” Nick noted as he looked around.

I pointed at the building. “She’s got to be in there.”

“Jodie, did you hear that? That was not Sadie. It was an animal or something. We need to go back and bring the rest of the searchers here with us.”

“It has to be her! She was crying. I’m going to look in there. You can come with me or not, up to you.” 

Without heeding any of Nick’s protestations, I broke out into a sprint toward the structure.  My breath was fogging up in front of me, my aching feet pounded the frozen grass. I didn’t have time to ask why there were no trees growing here, how Sadie ended up so deep into the woods, or why her cries sounded like they did, there was a scared little girl in that building and I had to-

BAM!

My body hit the earth beneath me with a crash. All the air was knocked out of my lungs as I struggled back onto my knees. In front of me lay my flashlight, the bulb cracked, blinking irregularly. It would ignite for a second then go out. Ignite. Go out.

*Shit*, I thought to myself as I got up on my feet. I looked behind me to see what had tripped me. In the brief flashes of light, I could make out the shape of a teddy bear, frozen to the ground. 

I turn back toward the building. I could now see where Sadie was taking refuge. A church. It was desolate and rundown, its wooden walls looked like they were about to buckle under the weight of the roof. The door at the front of the church was ajar. In the brief flashes of light that illuminated just inside the door, there was someone. I was too far away to make out any features but in the half second of light, there was a silhouette, and in the next, it was gone. 

“Hello? Sadie?” I called out as I slowly approached the door, “It’s Mr. Jodie. You can come out!” I waited for a second, expecting to hear Sadie’s little voice reply to me, to call for help. Silence was the only reply.

I slowly made my way to the door and pushed it open. Its rusted metal hinges cried out as it swung open. Darkness greeted me through the doorway, as if light had never existed in this place. The quick blinks of light from my broken flashlight showed an open chapel. Pews long discarded had been flipped and tossed around the chapel with abandon. The centerpiece at the altar, a rotted wooden figure of Jesus.

I took a step into the chapel. The further I walked down the aisle, the more I became aware of the cold penetrating into my blood. The whole place reeked of damp, aging wood. A powerful smell of decay had me on the brink of retching. I quickly covered my nose with my hand to give my senses a relief. The floorboards creaked with every step, as if my weight was about to finally break them after all these years. Why was this here? Who built this place? Was it colder in this church than outside? All questions that had to be asked later. I needed to find Sadie and get her warm. 

“Sadie?” I said quietly, looking around the room as much as my limited light would allow. I looked at the Jesus statue, His wooden face melting with rot. His mouth stretched and contorted as if screaming. 

The floorboards behind me creaked and I quickly spun around in just enough time to see the door slam shut. My flashlight bulb gave out and popped. I was now in a world of complete darkness. I stood there, only blackness in front of me, listening. Silence. 

“Hello?” I found myself saying, involuntarily. I knew something wasn’t right. Sadie isn’t here. If she was here, she would’ve come to me.

Then I heard it.

A giggle.

A sweet little girl’s laugh called to me in the blackness of the church. My blood froze. That wasn’t Sadie. It sounded like her but I knew in my heart that wasn’t the little girl I came in here to find. The laughter was tinged with malice, a putrid display of ravenous joy.

It was right in front of me. I know for a fact the door was across the room from me but that thing was in the way.

My eyes wouldn’t adjust to the darkness. I was walking blind. My hands extended out in front of me, desperate to find a wall. One step forward. And then another. 

Something brushed against my back.

I swung my arm around to push back whatever touched me but my hands met nothing but the frigid air.

Then came another laugh. A boy. It came from my right. From my left, a girl joined his laughter. Then another began to laugh from behind me. Then another in front. Their laughter grew louder and louder, their heckling morphing into screams, joining together into a cacophony of inhuman suffering. Like goats being tortured. I placed my hands over my ears to try my best to not hear them but it was futile. The sound bored into my skull. I screamed. Something in my mind told me if I didn’t make it to the door, I would die in this chapel.

As quickly as it began, the screaming stopped. The only sounds were my panicked breathing and something else breathing right in front of my face. It’s hot, putrid breath blew straight into my face. It was silently laughing at me. Breathing its vile stench of rotten fruit with abandon. The heat of its body radiated the once frigid air, like stepping into the warm glow of the fireplace after being locked out in the cold. I saw nothing but darkness in front of me.

I pressed my back into the wall behind me, trying to put as much space between me and it as possible. It slithered back across to my right, pushing through the overturned pews with a wet scrape. There was silence. 

My hands pressed into the wall behind me, searching for any way that I could orient myself in the dark room. The walls felt warm, covered in a mucousy slime. Bile built up in the back of my throat as my hands slid easily along the wood. There was no sound in the room, the beating of my heart in my ears the only thing breaking the unholy silence. Then it began to speak.

“*It’s Mr. Jodie. It’s Mr. Jodie.*”

It was trying to recreate MY voice. It wasn’t perfect. It sounded as if a dying cat was trying to impersonate me.

“*It’s Mr. Jodie.*”

Every attempt at mimicking my voice, the being snarled and coughed like a smoker’s laugh. The wet, bellowing voice edging ever closer to my ear with every attempt.

*“It’s Mr. Jodie.”*

It was getting closer. Toying with me as it practiced its devilish trick on me. Hulking, wet footsteps echoing through the desolate chapel.

*“It’s Mr. Jodie.”*

It WAS me.

The sweat pouring out of my body felt frozen on my skin. The tears cascading out of  my eyes fell down my cheeks in slow, freezing streams. I slinked along the wall to my left. I had to make it to the door.

With every minuscule step I took, the wooden floor beneath me squelched. One step. Two steps. Every step I took away, it took a step closer. Why won’t my eyes adjust to the dark?

*“Come. Here. Come. Here. Come. Here,”* it kept repeating to me in Sadie’s voice. Every word broken up with a wheezing, phlegmy inhale from within its vile existence.

My arm came in contact with the adjacent wall with a wet plop. I finally laid eyes on the door, the moonlight coming in from the other side illuminating the edges of my salvation. I leapt toward the door, reaching for freedom from this hell, when all of the sudden, I was slammed into the wall, pinned there by the heavy body of my tormenter. 

My breath was knocked out of me, leaving me gasping for air, unable to move against the gelatinous wall. Its reeking, hot breath blowing into my ear as it leaned close to me, wheezing a mocking laugh. I felt its hand reach up and slide its putrid, slimy fingers all along my jaw and cheek, leaving a trail in the wake of its repulsive touch. The appendages slowly followed the trail of my cheek and slithered their way into my nose. My face was on fire as I felt it explore the inside of my sinuses, but no cry could come from my mouth, no sound could be heard besides the squelching of its exploration and the satisfied crackling from its mouth.

The door to the church creaked open accompanied by a familiar voice.

“Jodie? Are you here?” Nick called out into the room. 

I could see Nick silhouetted against the moonlight in the doorframe. His eyes met mine and he froze, all the color drained from his face.

As quickly as it started, it dropped me to the ground and ran into the dark recesses of the chapel, leaving me a heap on the ground. Nick ran over to me and helped me up. His arms wrapped around my shoulders as he helped my legs take one step after another. The adrenaline pushed us past the entryway, out into the biting cold. We didn’t look back as he escorted me out of the church.

Across the field, I was able to steady myself on my own two feet. From there, we ran. And ran. And ran. His glow-in-the-dark paint on the trees guided us toward our salvation.

We finally made a stop. Both of us hunched over, hands on our knees, trying to catch our breath. My nose and throat still burned from the probing I was subjected to. He looked at me, eyes wide, breath shaky.

“You’re bleeding. All out of your nose.”

I brought my hand up to my face and wiped it clean.

And that was all that was said between us as we followed Nick’s glow-in-the-dark trail back to our starting point.

We emerged from the trees and were greeted with a crowd of people, fellow searchers, neighborhood folks wearing their nightwear alike. They were all crowded around something. Yelling, shouting for something but I could not hear what.

Nick and I exchanged glances before trudging our tired legs to the crowd. Nick tapped on a fellow searcher's shoulder, I think his name was Samuel.

“What’s going on?”

“Where have you guys been? They found her an hour ago. She’s alive!”

I couldn’t believe it. I wanted to, but I couldn’t.

I pushed my way through the crowd. I had to see for sure.

Sure enough, there she was.

In the arms of her father.

I could tell when he saw me, he had a look of utter joy, smiling ear-to-ear at me. I didn’t see it.

All I could see was little Sadie Carmine. Her face contorted in an inhuman grin. My eyes met hers and there was no life in them. She giggled.",1,1752960293.0,creepcast,1,0.67,False

One plane ticket, a backpack full of camera gear, and a heart held together with duct tape. That’s all I had when I left the States for Scotland, hoping to trace the roots of ancestors I barely knew—and maybe find a place where I finally belonged after being shunned by the only family I’d ever known.

What I didn’t expect?

Three remarkable women who saw more in me than I ever could.

A grumpy old lady with more wisdom than tact.

And a tangled web of love, grief, guilt, and second chances.

This isn’t a fairy tale. There’s no magic wand, no easy answers.

But there is love. Real love. Complicated, messy, worth it love.

And maybe—just maybe—a place to call home.

If you like sharp-tongued Scots, slow-burn romances, emotional gut-punches, and a man trying very hard not to cry in front of women who are far tougher than he is…

Welcome to my story.

Hope you brought tissues.

🚨 WARNING! 🚨

This is a romance story.

Not fantasy. Not sci-fi. No dragons, no orcs, no brooding elves in leather pants. Just love—messy, complicated, beautiful love. Think Hallmark Christmas movie… if Hallmark wasn’t afraid of a little swearing and a lot of sex.

It’s a harem/poly romance, rooted in deep emotional connections and very real vulnerability. The characters don’t just kiss under the mistletoe—they explore every layer of intimacy, including the sweaty, breathless, tangled-up-in-the-sheets kind.

There are graphic sex scenes. There’s explicit language. There’s laughter, heartbreak, awkward silences, stolen glances, and more emotionally charged pillow talk than most people can handle before their morning coffee.

It’s not fade-to-black. It’s not closed-door. If they fall in love, you’re going to see how that love is expressed—raw, real, and very much on the page.

If that sounds like your kind of story, pour yourself a cup of tea (or a dram of whisky) and settle in.

If not? Maybe save this one for when you’re feeling a little braver.

You’ve been warned. 💜

Ordering coffee or ice tea isn't questioned.

There are too many people to remember them all, so forgive me if I forget your name. I need your help, I don't know how I wound up in this situation but I seem to have been ground hog day'd. I have seen the world ending thousands of times and I need someone to help me.



It wasn't world ending apocalypses initially it started out with small things, I'd get hit by a car and die, so the next time round I would wait till the car went past, then cross the street. Just little things like that, after the first hundred or so times around though, things started to get a little more extreme, the first such example was a man with a knife who charged me and stabbed me to death, so I called the police ahead of time. They made it, stopped him from attacking me and hit me with a stray bullet when the knife man charged them. After that, I took a different route to the coffee shop. The first time I actually made it to the coffee shop a gas line exploded when I arrived and killed me, and, I assume everyone else there at the same time.



After that I decided to try and leave town, so I went to catch a train, which promptly derailed and took out everyone on the platform as it did so. The strange thing is though, that I checked the news while I was on the platform and the gas line didn't explode this time around.



That got me thinking, if bad things were only happening to kill me, what if I just stayed home and waited it out. Well, the only time I tried that I was the victim of a plane crash in my own livingroom. I decided that my best course of action was to wander the city for the day and do my best to be aware of my surroundings, and wouldn't you know it, it got me further than anything I'd tried so far, but ultimately failed when we were hit with a chemical weapon strike



At that point I came to the decision that I should stay away from crowds to minimize the casualties, the problem was that I didn't own a car, so my options were public transport or walk, and public transport hadn't treated me well today. I started walking first thing in the morning, by noon I was on the city outskirts with lifestyle blocks lining the highway. I made sure to stay well away from any vehicle that I saw on the road. That, of course, didn't stop the bombs from killing me. I turned around after the bright flash and, a couple seconds later, woke up back in my bed. The next few attempts I tried running, but for the first time, the exact cause of death repeated itself. That's when I realized that the only way to prevent an event was to be safely out of it's reach. I spent a few attempts trying to find the most accessable bike I could to “borrow”, after a few attempts I found that one of the bikes at the convenience store had been left unlocked. That time I made it to the next town over, turns out, they were quite earthquake prone. It took a few attempts, but I eventually found a safe spot to weather the earth quake.



The declaration of war came next several world leaders were assassinated all at once and everyone blamed everyone else, and then the missiles began to fly, and, surprise surprise, the first nuke hit the town in was in. Interestingly enough, if I didn't go to that town, the war didn't happen, I figured that since I was far enough from that first nuke that I didn't die immediately, then it had to be a different cause of death.



I had taken to keeping up with the news to try and avoid anything that seemed dangerous. I basically gave up when I saw that a virus had swept across more than half of the Continental United States in a matter of hours, leaving very few survivors in its wake. The experts were saying 97% of the population was dead within 5 minutes of first symptoms, and believe me, it was not a comfortable 5 minutes. After that I tried to break the loop myself a couple of times, if you catch my drift. That, evidently also didn't work. That's when I had an idea scuba gear should have enough oxygen for me to last at least the initial pass of the virus, and if the pattern holds, that meant that it wouldn't happen at all. I was right, I looked like an idiot in a stolen scuba mask, but I was right. That still didn't stop the meteor though, and that's where I've been stuck for the past few hundred days, 3.37pm, the world ends. And I don't know if there is any way, aside from breaking the time loop, to stop it. Which brings us to the reason I'm writing this now. I think I have figured out a way to break it. I've spent a few decades at this point studying mythology about time loops and I think I know which one I'm in.



Are you familiar with the concept of purgatory? Well, it's kind of like that, except, I'm not dead yet, and it's contagious. It's a punishment and once I have made amends and attoned for my sins, I believe I will be set free. It also turns out that, by sharing my knowledge I have spread the reach of this curse. Thank you all, for taking on a portion of my suffering and making penance for my sins.



If you want my advice, don't dodge the car, it hurts a lot less than the feeling of you lungs liqufying in you chest.

1m475wi,https://i.redd.it/bvupxitfcwdf1.jpeg,"Why Networking in Law Isn’t About Schmoozing, It’s About Survival","If the word “networking” makes your eyes roll, you’re not alone. Most lawyers didn’t go into the field because they love cocktail hours or handing out business cards. But here’s the thing, networking isn’t about being slick or salesy. In law, it’s often the difference between stagnation and opportunity.

A lot of people think networking means awkward small talk at conferences or chasing people on LinkedIn. But in reality, it’s about building genuine professional relationships, people who trust you, think of you when something comes up, or vouch for you when a door opens. And in a profession where so much depends on referrals, reputation, and word-of-mouth, that matters more than you think.

Plenty of legal jobs and opportunities are never posted online. They’re shared quietly through networks, between former colleagues, law school classmates, even opposing counsel. If you’re not connected, you may never even hear about them.

The best time to build your network is before you “need” anything. That might mean grabbing coffee with someone you admire, following up after a CLE panel, or just keeping in touch with old law school friends. It’s not about asking for favors, it’s about staying visible, helpful, and authentic.

And don’t underestimate how much value you can offer, even early in your career. Maybe you’re the one who knows a niche area, has a great resource, or connects two people who should know each other. That’s networking too.

So, the next time you think, “I’m not the networking type,” try reframing it. You’re not selling yourself; you’re investing in your future. And in law, relationships are often just as important as résumés.

Here the majority of the good coffee beans are exported and unless you’re a direct farmer or producer, the majority of people drink the sub product, meaning beans that have fungus, are broken or have many defects and then brands roast those beans to dark and beyond in order to hide those defects, we call this coffee “pasilla”, and there also and argument that brewing this coffee produces a toxic compound called “lacrilamida”

However currently there is an increasing amount of specialty coffee shops opening all over the country and for what I have learning for good specialty coffee,  beans need to have either a light or medium roast depending on the bean profile and flavours you want.

Nonetheless while I know that dark roast are used to hide defects of bad beans, is a dark roast necessarily bad or there are ways to apply dark roast to specialty coffee.",2,1752959264.0,SpecialtyCoffee,3,1.0,False

1m471zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1m471zw/shall_i_switch_to_an_espresso_machine/,Shall I switch to an Espresso Machine?,"Hi all. I've been using Nespresso for over 8 years, using machines ranging from their basics to their expensive creatista plus range, and also a few vertuo machines. I've taste tested over 60 capsules in different drink styles, milks, syrups, sugars, black, shots, and more. 

Now I've never used an Espresso machine, but one thing I constantly notice in cafés is that they make such saturated coffee and use such less water, which makes it perfect for lots of drinks. With Nespresso, even with the classic models where you can hold the button to modify the water amount, or by selecting the least water on the touchscreen creatista models, the water amount feels far too much for me, and the espresso taste (aside from Kazaar) is too light no matter what. 

I usually have 3 espresso shots with my iced lattes for example but the water amount fills at least 1/3 of my large cup when it feels like it should be 1/4 or less, and I can taste the wateryness unless I thin it out with less espressos which makes the drink rather weak. Just to also say, if I order 5 shots in Starbucks for my iced latte, it still feels like most of it is made up of milk, but 5 shots with Nespresso machines would fill the cup up most likely past midpoint. 

Anyhow, TLDR, I was considering also buying an espresso machine, and wondered if experienced people here could comment on if that'd work well for me for more concentrated espresso shots? ",2,1752959173.0,nespresso,9,0.75,False

1m471ag,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m471ag,Mold Test Results from Coffee Cart — Seeking Advice!,"Hello! Hopefully this is the right sub. I own a small coffee cart business inside a retail space and recently had the area tested for mold after some spills made their way under the vinyl flooring. We took samples from the floor where the leak happened near the cart, the air, and the cart itself. The floor and air came back positive for Chaetomium, while the cart showed Alternaria, Chaetomium, and Smut Group Molds. I’ve attached images from the report.

We had a couple of mold remediation companies come out for estimates. Both said the levels were very low and not unusual for a beach town. One even rated the severity as a 1 or 2 out of 10 and suggested we could just clean or replace the old cart and clean around the flooring instead of removing it. While we won’t know exactly what’s underneath until we pull it up, we’re starting to wonder if the Chaetomium found outside the cart might actually be coming from the cart itself, not from under the floor. If that’s the case, replacing the cart might make more sense than tearing up the flooring.

1m46zyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndividualTea/comments/1m46zyy/the_audacity_of_being_me/,The audacity of being me,"I sometimes don’t like being me. I’m not suicidal or anything, but I do think there’s room for improvement. Like… a lot of times I just ramble on and post things. This time I’m doing it to Reddit on a new account, on a new subreddit that I created, and I have no idea why I did any of that, but I’m about to find out why.

It’s because of Jesus.

No I’m just kidding, it’s not because of Jesus it’s because I have a brain injury too and I like to scare myself sometimes. I am actually not very religious. I believe in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior and that’s about it. I believe the Bible is a book of interpretations and you need to find the right “sect” of church to belong to that believes what you believe and then you’re all set. I happen to be a Methodist. We believe that basically anybody can get to heaven, including atheists and LGBTQ+ people, and even murderers and criminals. That *God’s Love is greater than Man’s Evil*, and that nearly no human sin is devoid of His forgiveness. (Especially for *eternity*, good Lord, no pun intended.)

What does that have to do with being trans? Nothing. Or everything depending on how you look at it. What mold do I fit into? Am I just another “country liberal girl” out here in Oregon like I *want to be*? My liberal friends here seem to think so, and what’s wrong with that?

That doesn’t make me a conservative at all, but it shows I can have some conservative beliefs. It also shows that conservative people don’t automatically *hate* trans people. They hate what they see in the media, and if they realized we were just *normal men and women just placed in the wrong bodies* they might not be so defensive or hateful, because that’s **literally** what *transgender* means.

We **are** in the *wrong* bodies. We *are not* biologically correct. If we *were*, we would be like the other **ninety nine percent of people**. That’s not enough of a percentage to state what is “biologically normal” in common speech? And then we dissect that up *further*?

Does everyone understand how *small* of a population we are, especially in small towns and cities? We go to BIG CITIES, where people are EDUCATED on these things. What do we expect? Senior citizens in small towns that have never met a transgender person to suddenly understand the intricacies of the non-binary gender group? That’s **insane** logic.  *And completely unnecessary*.  There *ARE* only two genders (or none). There’s *variations* within them but like… does grandpa need to know all subcategories of Electro Phonk Drum and Bass EDM, or can you just say it’s techno music?

Like, what are we doing here? We need to **open up** communication, not shut it down because we can give a dissertation on gender studies. Like no black person quizzes a white one on black history before they *accept them back*, we’re being unreasonable in our expectations. That still doesn’t mean you take my healthcare away.

I get *locked within myself over these discussions within myself*. How will I eat? Can I survive on coffee and pure hatred for the world, save for pure true love for my daughters and some spare change for a few others? Like if I actually want to bathe the world in kerosene, like the song says, what’s preventing the next victim of abuse from doing the same thing over and over and over again repeatedly, typing into Reddit, asking the void, when is the domestic abuse going to go away? Maybe this is some type of catharsis, typing this shit out.

Like, I don’t know how to get anything off my chest about going through this world as an abused trans woman without having to go through all of that windup just to get my brain to accept this point:

I’m a victim of domestic abuse and violence. This whole subreddit was created as a pathway to escape my abuser, and I’m learning this as I type this. I’m going to be emailing a link of this to my doctor and likely the judge in a custody case, because this is my “disability”. I’m a severe victim of domestic violence by a woman who is controlling my children and holding them hostage while there’s nothing I can do because I’m a trans woman with a documented brain injury from an explosion in 2008 but with tons of letters saying I’m clear to take care of my children.

I’ve spent quite some time with the ELEGOO Saturn 4 Ultra 16K, and one of the first things I noticed was the sleek, modern design. The black metal finish gives it a premium feel—a blend of sophistication and sturdiness. Measuring 12.8 x 12.9 x 21.5 inches and weighing a hefty 35.4 pounds, it’s not a device you casually move around, which adds to its robust presence. The structure feels firm, and for a machine of its capabilities, you'd want it to be as solid as it is.

**Exceptional Printing Resolution and Size**  
The standout feature, without a doubt, is its ultra-high resolution. With an impressive 16K LCD screen boasting a 15120 x 6230px resolution (14 x 19µm), the details this machine can produce are jaw-dropping. From intricate designs to larger models, its sizable 8.33 x 4.66 x 8.66-inch print bed provides plenty of room for creativity. This was particularly exciting for me as I printed a highly detailed miniature; the vibrations in my coworker's voice saying, “This is insane resolution!” rang true the moment they saw it.

**[Check ELEGOO Saturn 4 Ultra 16K price on Amazon.](https://measuringworld.com/p/b0dt938sdk/)**

**Game-Changing Heated Resin Tank**  
Winter can be a nightmare for resin printing. That’s where the heated resin tank on this machine becomes an unsung hero. Maintaining optimal temperatures of 25°C or higher, it eliminates fluctuating resin properties during colder days. I tested this feature on a chilly evening, pushing the limits, and it worked like a charm. The automatic heating kicked in seamlessly when the resin started cooling down. It removed a lot of the guessing I’d dealt with on other printers in the past.

**Next-Level Smart Features**  
Diving deeper into its tech-savvy appeal, the AI camera stood out for its real-time monitoring capabilities. Printing late at night? No worries—the camera, with its integrated lighting, keeps visuals crisp. During a 10-hour print session at work, a slight model detachment happened midway, and thanks to the camera’s alert, I caught the issue before it snowballed into a disaster. Meanwhile, the smart monitoring system is another win. With a combination of resin level detection, foreign object checking, and auto-leveling, it significantly reduces misprints. 

**True High-Speed Printing**  
Who doesn’t love a fast job well done? The tilted release technology and boosted light energy intensity increase print speed to an impressive 150mm/h. There’s no need to invest in fancy rapid resins—this printer is a beast with standard materials, which I truly appreciated as someone budget-conscious. A friend of mine who typically complains about their slow resin printer almost spit out their coffee seeing how quickly the Saturn 4 Ultra 16K delivered a flawless figurine. 

**Good Points**  
- Exceptional 16K resolution for intricate model details.  
- Heated resin tank ensures smoother winter operation.  
- High-speed printing paired with remarkable accuracy.  

**Critiques**  
- This machine isn’t for small spaces—it’s heavy and large.  
- The heated resin feature, while fantastic, demands a bit more power consumption.  
- The AI camera work sometimes feels overly sensitive, sending alerts that aren't always critical.  

**Industry Competitors**  
The Saturn 4 Ultra 16K stands out against other popular models in the resin printer market, such as the Anycubic Photon Mono X 6K and Phrozen Sonic Mega 8K. The higher resolution of this printer is a clear advantage over these competitors. However, the Anycubic model wins in terms of affordability and simpler setup for beginners, while the Sonic Mega 8K's impressively large build area puts it ahead for enthusiasts focused on supersized projects. Nevertheless, none of them come close to matching the speed and comprehensive smart features of this ELEGOO printer.

**Quality for Price**  
From my perspective, the investment in this cutting-edge machine justifies itself for anyone serious about resin printing. It combines tech-forward innovation and printing capabilities that are rare at this price point. There’s no need for additional upgrades or exotic materials to achieve stellar results—it already comes equipped to deliver professional-quality prints.

1m46xcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1m46xcl/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

This is my story, and these are the first two songs. Would love some feedback and would like to know if anyone can sing ?

Hey everyone, My name is Venky, and I'm from India. I've never been a songwriter or musician, but I've always believed music is the best way to express our real feelings.

Recently, I went through a terrible breakup that's left me in a very bad mental state. I've never been good at talking about my feelings with anyone – I always feel like I'm overreacting or that people won't understand. So, instead of letting my story fade away, I decided to turn it into a small album. I was also terrified of forgetting her – her face, her voice, our memories. These songs are my way of holding on to them while they're still clear.

I had zero knowledge, so I spent weeks listening to hundreds of songs and reading everything I could about songwriting. I wrote down my entire story, raw and unfiltered, and started turning the key moments into songs.

I'd be grateful if you could read the first two chapters (lyrics) of my story. I'm looking for any feedback at all. Please forgive any mistakes, I'm just starting out.

Thanks for reading.

**[Lyrics for my two songs]**

**SONG 1: ""Fate Had Planned it All""**

( Story behind it - A boy (myself) who fell in love when he wasn’t looking for it and how he felt about it )

**[Spoken Intro]**

""It's funny what you remember. For me, it wasn't in some big crowd or at a party. It was just a quiet moment... in the college sports room. Out of all the faces there, I remember yours. That was the moment my story really began, even though I didn't realize it at the time...""

**[Verse 1]**

Wasn't looking for love when I first saw you,

But you came like a miracle, so true.

From Snapchat texts to midnight calls,

We got close like fate planned it all.

We were scared ,different in faith,

Still promised to fight, whatever it takes.

You became my peace, my daily start,

Slipped right into my broken heart.


**[Pre-Chorus]**

And all your friends they said that I was just a mess,

But you looked past the noise and saw the best, I must confess.

**[Chorus]**

'Cause you're the one I never knew I was waiting for,

You walked right in and opened up a different door.

And all I know is I love you more,

Than anyone I've ever loved before.


**[Verse 2]**

I made you my world, let the others slide,

Loving you - the best part of my life.

I just loved you - that’s all I knew,

Never played games, never lied to you.

Didn’t want your body, didn’t want your face,

I just wanted your love, your time, your space.


**[Pre-Chorus]**

And all your friends they said that I was just a mess,

But you looked past the noise and saw the best, I must confess.


**[Chorus]**

'Cause you're the one I never knew I was waiting for,

You walked right in and opened up a different door.

And all I know is I love you more,

Than anyone I've ever loved before.


**[Verse 3]**

Remember all the nights we'd talk until the sun came up?

Just you and me, the world was in a coffee cup.

You held my hand and told me all your dreams and fears,

The safest I had felt in all my lonely years.


**[Bridge]**

Before you, I was just walking in the dark,

Didn't know my life was waiting for a spark.

You saw the real me, you didn't see the rest,

Just by loving me, you gave me the best.


**[Chorus]**

'Cause you're the one I never knew I was waiting for,

You walked right in and opened up a different door.

And all I know is I love you more,

Than anyone I've ever loved before.


**[Outro]**

The one I never knew I was waiting for...

Yeah... you're the one.


**SONG 2: “The First Fight”**

(story behind it - its when this boy found that she lied about somethings, how she lied to him multiple times, how it felt for him , and how he suffered because of it , )


**[Spoken Intro]**

""The worst part isn't the lie itself. It's the moment right before. When the air gets quiet... and you look at the person you love... and you realize you don't recognize them anymore. Your gut tells you something is wrong... and you know nothing will ever be the same again.""


**[Verse 1]**

The first lie surfaced, and we had our first real fight,

My anger burned so hot all through that lonely night.

You cried and begged and promised me you'd change your ways,

And I agreed to stay with you, to see some better days.

I told you, ""Just be honest,"" that's all I'd ever ask,

I put a broken smile on, I put on my loving mask.


**[Pre-Chorus]**

And I wanted to believe you, I wanted it so bad,

To get back to the only love that I had ever had.


**[Chorus]** 

I gave you a second chance, but it wasn't for you,

It was for me, to see if my love was true.

I had to swallow all my pride and all the pain,

And learn how to trust in you all over again.


**[Verse 2]**

A couple months went by, I thought that we were good,

Then the real truth came out, and I finally understood.

That first whole story, it was all a lie again,

And my heart shattered right there and then.

I told you, ""We are over, I can't do this anymore,""

But you just cried and begged me right there on the floor.

Said "" Venky…baby, I will never lie to you again""


**[Pre-Chorus]**

And I wanted to believe you, I wanted it so bad,

To get back to the only love that I had ever had.


**[Chorus]**

I gave you a second chance, but it wasn't for you,

It was for me, to see if my love was true.

I had to swallow all my pride and all the pain,

And learn how to trust in you all over again.


**[Bridge]**

I cried alone those nights, you never even knew,

The hell that I was quietly going through.

My hands would start to shake, my heart would start to pound,

And I just needed something to quiet down the sound.

So I started smoking weed to kill the doubt and pain,

To stop the looping thoughts that drove my heart 
insane.

It helped me trust you more and see a future there,

And let me love you deeper, it let me truly care.


**[Chorus]**

I gave you a second chance, but it wasn't for you,

It was for me, to see if my love was true.

I had to swallow all my pride and all the pain,

And learn how to trust in you all over again.


**[Outro]**

All over again...

How do you trust... all over again?

They chose four students to perform poems and I was one of them. I got told that I was not only one of the best preformers but also the best poet. Apparently I had many people crying both nights even if they saw it the first time. I've also performed it at my annual party and that had many people crying because the party is part celebration of who we've lost. 

Chosen Threads
Family—
 A word whispered across centuries,
 etched into the stone of ancient tongues,
 born in the cradle of time
 where blood ran thick
 and names meant legacy.
 It once meant lineage,
 a circle sealed by bone and blood,
 a tribe tied by the echo of one’s voice,
 one’s history,
 one’s inherited name.
But what if I told you…
 that family is more than just the blood
 pulsing beneath your skin?
What if it's the people you hand-pick
 in moments of laughter,
 or in silences that don’t ache?
Brown eyes that remind you of warm coffee
 on a rainy Tuesday morning.
 Blue eyes like frozen lakes
 that see through your chaos
 and still stay.
 Green eyes that hold the wild of forests,
 fierce and forgiving,
 growing things in places
 you thought were long dead.
Different skins—
 like pages in a novel
 each telling a tale
 of triumph and ache,
 of home and exile,
 of prayers in different tongues
 that all beg for the same grace:
 To be seen.
 To be loved.
 To belong.
Family is not always found in a photo frame,
 with smiling faces frozen in time.
 Sometimes,
 family is the hand that steadies yours
 when your world splits open.
 The friend who answers at 2 a.m.
 when your soul forgets how to breathe.
 The teacher who sees your pain
 and says, “I see you. Still, I see you.”
It's the cousin who isn’t really a cousin,
 but knows your dreams better than anyone else.
Sometimes maybe yourself. 
 The neighbor who slipped a casserole to your doorstep
 the day grief swallowed your grandmother’s name.
 The girl who offered half her sandwich in fifth grade,
 and has shared her heart ever since.
Family is Sunday mornings
 with pancakes and syrup-sticky fingers.
 It’s fighting over the TV remote 
Debating which cartoon to watch 
Before the football game
 and laughing until your ribs hurt.
 It’s sitting in silence—
 but never feeling alone.
It is love dressed in all its colors,
 not always soft, not always gentle—
 sometimes loud, messy,
 sometimes broken.
 But still,
 love.
We don’t always get to choose the bloodline,
 but we choose the souls
 who stay.
 Who build us up
 when we’ve torn ourselves down.
 Who show up—
 not because they have to,
 but because they want to.
So maybe
 family isn’t a name.
 Or a tradition.
 Or a tree with perfectly drawn branches.
Maybe it’s a garden—
 wild and strange and sacred.
 Where seeds fall in unexpected places,
 and grow anyway.
Maybe it’s a quilt—
 patched together from all the hearts
 that dared to love us.
Maybe it’s you.
 Maybe it’s me.
 Maybe it's whoever reminds us
 we are worthy of being held.
And so,
 to anyone listening—
 if you’ve ever felt alone in a crowded room,
Maybe perhaps this room
 if you’ve ever wondered where your place is—
 look again.
 Because family is not always born.
 Sometimes,
 family is found.
And they become our chosen Threads.
For…
A.. Reason.

1m46ptt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m46ptt/aitah_for_thinking_husband_might_be_using_visits/,AITAH for thinking husband might be using visits with his grandmother as a cover to cheat,"In the six years we've been together in person, after knowing one another online for years beforehand, he has gone through periods of time where he either doesn't talk to/see his grandmother or he does so a lot. There is no in between. He was seeing her the most at the start, when he didn't drive, and she would come to take him/us places a few times a week. After he learned to drive, he stopped seeing her as much. He has gone months without seeing or speaking to her, claiming he feels bad about it, but not doing anything about it. 

A few years back, after he learned to drive, he mentioned going to see her several times but didn't follow through with it. I noticed that he went back on it only after I asked to go with him, having previously told me he wanted me to, something which I was hesitant to do because of my anxiety but I wanted to step out of my comfort zone. He would come up with various reasons the day of like he was tired, or he couldn't be bothered. This kept happening until I stopped asking to go. That is when he went. He sent me a picture of her ironing whilst there. 

Something which I found strange because though I had suspicions of cheating at the time, they were more subdued, and I initially thought nothing of him going to see her. Then he sent me a gif which said ""I miss u."" When he came back late that night, he told me he sent the gif accidently. He also complained of a bad headache and said he needed to go to bed because of it. He was overly sweet, and apologetic, saying how much he missed and loved me and wanted to spend time together. He told me he'd spend time with me the next day. 

The next day he was glued to his phone and blanking me from the moment he got up. I tried to talk to him, to show him things, and he  seemingly refused to engage. When I got upset over this, and said he was ignoring me, he denied it and got annoyed with me. I posted about this shift in behavior, and people said that he was having an affair, and that he felt guilty over it and therefore was extra sweet because of it to deflect, and that the headache was also a deflection. I was skeptical of this saying that I didn't think he was. 

After that he went months without seeing her, or speaking to her, and was talking about going to see her again. I asked to go with him, after he made comments about me doing so, and he said yes each time. However, just as before he backed out of going last minute, whilst complaining at the same time that he felt bad for not seeing her. We were at the hospital one time and he told me he was going to see her later that day, and said yes to me going with him. He kept encouraging me to go to the bathroom to collect a urine sample, after I already tried to but couldn't. 

He got irriated with me for not going to the bathroom, suggesting that I sat there until I was able to pee. It made me think he was trying to text someone. His mood was good at the hospital but after we left, it changed, and he started complaining. He said, when asked if he was going to see his grandmother still, that he wasn't because he was tired. It was before we went to America for months a while back that he went to see her a few times, insisting those times that I came and so I did. He told me he wanted to see her more often after we were back, and wanted me to come each time he did. But then we came back, and he went months without seeing or speaking to her again. 

Then a few months back it was her birthday, and he offered to for me to come and see a movie, but quickly went off the idea. He talked about briefly visiting with her in the car, and asked me to come for that, before settling on going to eat with her at a restaurant she was already going to. Shortly after this he he told me she needed her phone looked at, and that he was going to meet up with her in the car, halfway between where they both live. He repeatedly invited me to come along, including on the day of when we went for a coffee beforehand, less than an hour before he was meant to meet up with her. 

I said no up to the point that we got back to the house, and he was telling me he was running late and to go inside. When I said I changed my mind and wanted to come with him, he didn't say anything and seemed taken aback. It was after I said it again when he acted like it was an inconvenience, even though I was ready to go. He started cycling between various reasons why he didn't want me to, from him not feeling like he could talk about certain things with her around me, to telling me that she would rush the visit due to me being there and he wouldn't have long with her. 

When I challenged all of this, and asked why he invited me in the first place, he told me he felt bad about me not coming, but that he actually wanted to go alone. He came back quite late and when he did, and I heard him coming up the stairs, I quickly shut the laptop and turned the lamp off before laying down, wanting to be left alone. He said that he saw the main light switch off as he was coming up the room, and that I did what I did to manipulate him, to make him feel bad like I had been laying down depressed the entire time. I said that wasn't true, and that the main light wasn't on, but he kept arguing with me that it was. 

It seemed like he was trying to project something onto me. After this he told me on more than one occasion that he was needing to meet up with her to look at her phone, including a day we had plans to go somewhere. When I got upset over this, and asked if it could wait, he acted like he had no choice and it took priority over our plans. He mentioned me going, but only if he went to her house. He made no mention of me going if they met up in the car again, and he didn't seem to want me to as before. 

When I said this he told me he never said that, but also offered to drive there and back and then back out with me. I said it made more sense me coming, and him meeting up with her first, and he reluctantly agreed. Only instead of going where he went before, he suggested they met elsewhere, and was in the car with her for over a fraction of the time he was before. After this he stopped seeing her, stopped responding to her messages or calling her, and was back to periodically saying he felt bad.

That was until yesterday when I noticed he was back to texting her, and her phone was being mentioned again, and he told her he would need to take a look at it. The thing is, it appears to be his grandmother than he is communicating with a majority of the time. He takes her calls in private having told me repeatedly he doesn't like talking in front of people. But the texts are clearly from her as she mentions his grandfather, and things they are doing together which I know that they are. 

I don't know if perhaps he's seeing someone else the same days he goes up to see her, using visiting her a cover up to meet with this other person. He's been a gaurding his phone a bit, taking it with him to the bathroom when he doesn't usually, and seemingly trying to keep it away from me or keep me from looking at it whilst he's on it. This has only been happening since he started texting her again a few days back. ",5,1752958280.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

Since I’ve been working in skincare and laser technology for nearly a decade, this is one device I’ve tested extensively both professionally and personally.

---

So, what’s my experience with it? In short: it works — if you understand what it’s built to do.

The Lumea Prestige uses IPL (intense pulsed light) to gradually reduce hair growth. It doesn’t “zap” hair away instantly like shaving or waxing, and it’s not a one-and-done solution like professional laser. What I’ve seen over the years is that consistent use — following the treatment schedule — leads to a *significant* reduction in hair regrowth, especially for those with lighter skin and darker hair (the ideal combo for IPL).

In my own testing, results became noticeable after 3–4 sessions. By the end of the initial treatment phase (typically 6–8 weeks), I saw around 80% less regrowth on my legs and underarms. Maintenance sessions every 4–6 weeks have kept things impressively smooth.

There *are* some caveats. The device doesn’t work well on very light blonde, red, grey, or white hair. It’s also not suitable for deeper skin tones due to the way IPL targets pigment. If that’s you, I usually recommend professional laser or newer devices tailored for darker skin.

Compared to cheaper IPL devices, the Lumea Prestige stands out for its ergonomic design, cordless use, and smart skin sensor. It feels thoughtfully made — and in a market flooded with copycat models, that’s worth something.

If someone asked me today whether it’s worth the price, I’d say this: if you’re a good candidate and willing to commit to the schedule, the Lumea Prestige is one of the best home IPL devices out there. It’s not magic, but it *is* effective — and freeing yourself from razors or salon appointments is a small luxury that adds up beautifully over time.",1,1752958270.0,ProTalks,0,1.0,False

The San Diego Padres (-147) and Washington Nationals (+123) clash on July 20, 2025, in a game that’s less a contest and more of a math problem. Let’s break it down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a ballpark hotdog vendor who’s seen it all.

**Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
The Padres enter as clear favorites, with implied odds of \~59.4% (thanks to their -147 line), while the Nationals hover around 44.6%. Bookmakers aren’t just betting on talent—they’re banking on history. The Padres win 59.2% of games when favored, a stat that screams “reliable under pressure.” The Nationals? A dismal 42.5% as underdogs, which is about the same chance I’d give you of correctly guessing my favorite sandwich (turkey club, but only if it’s served during a solar eclipse).

Offensively, the Padres “lead” the league in runs scored with a *meager* 4 per game (25th in MLB). Meanwhile, the Nationals, with a paltry 4.3 runs per contest (17th), are like a toaster that only pops half the time. It’s a numbers game, but the Padres’ pitching—led by Yu Darvish—might be the real star.

**Digesting the News: Yu Darvish vs. Mitchell Parker**  
Yu Darvish (0-1 this season) is the Padres’ ace, a man who once pitched a no-hitter while juggling parental duties and a part-time job as a yoga instructor. His 0-1 record is misleading—think of it as a 0-1 coffee order: “Zero sugar, one shot. Still perfect.” Darvish’s control and experience make him a fortress, while Mitchell Parker (5-10) for the Nationals is…

The man with the devil in him walked into the Harmony Hillside Hotel at eight AM, March of 1976. Nine days later, he packed his bags, made no complaints and walked out just the same as he had arrived.

\#

Just a Tuesday, Leila had just arrived not even five minutes ago. In those five minutes she had managed to gather the brute barrel from her closet office. Still sitting at the bottom was a thin layer of murky water from her last shift and coming from the mop that laid ever-damp within it was the ever so familiar scent of vinegar and hydrogen peroxide. 

Leila, now no longer a woman of just a few decades- her daughter was almost double the age she was the first time she entered this hotel- had become so accustomed to her daily routine that her mind was miles elsewhere as she began tying on her apron and clipping that well-worn and well-accoladed employee badge and name tag. 

Thirty years it had been since Leila had first stepped foot into the Harmony Hillside, she’d been young, in college, and a stranger to the area. In the time since, she’d learned the methods of steaming the carpets, mopping the ever-dirty kitchen floors, and the fastest technique of changing sheets you'd ever see. In the time since, she’d had to kick customers out, some folks who were most definitely not customers, some critters who had no concept of what it meant to be a customer, notably a couple raccoons who had decided to start a nuclear family within the walls, twice a large bird: possibly hawks (possibly the same hawk twice) and thrice a colony of rats. In her younger years, she’d stayed in the Harmony Hillside when she was checking out the local college for the first time. She’d stayed again her freshman year, partying with friends, drunkenly falling into a pool and laughing about it later. She’d stayed under the blindfold of love, with her so-called sweetheart, and the two enjoyed each other in what seemed to be the most magical night of her life. The hotel escaped her for only a year more before she returned looking for work, no longer with college in her mind. Though she was content with her daughter attending herself, many decades later.

She was so proud of her daughter and was willing to tell anyone who asked. Her daughter had grown into a strong young woman and was better off than she ever was. Since then, all those years ago, she’d stayed many times overnight, no night so romantic or echoing in memory with drunken laughter, rather the stays were largely spent steaming the hallways and sharpening those aforementioned sheet changing techniques. Though once she had stayed in lust, with a customer no less, in an attempt to grasp that feeling of romance she’d lost long ago. 

Though her life had waxed and waned and seemingly rotated around the hotel, her mind was in no such place as she exited the janitor's closet with a now full brute barrel. She hummed distractedly as she thought about the half-read book that lay in her passenger-side seat right now. Her book club meeting was that evening and the ladies and her were to go over the third chapter. She knew they would exchange predictions on what was to come but Leila, in secret, had already read well past the third chapter and couldn’t wait to see if anyone would guess close to the true happenings. 

As she went about mopping the kitchen area, breakfast having finished at seven forty-five, she made no notice of the man who walked in.

To her defense, it was an average weekday, at an average hotel, and he was by all accounts an average man. He was a short-ish black man, nothing special about his build, cleanly shaven with short hair, and he wore workman's casual clothes and carried a briefcase that looked well taken care of. He faced the desk, a homburg casting a shadow on half of his face.

The man strode from the door to the front desk, in which sat a close friend of Leila’s, a younger woman still in her college years flipping through a magazine, a pile of them sitting next to a small pot of plastic yellow flowers. 

“Morning Sir, how can I help you?” a corporate voice came.

“Morning. Just one room… eight nights.” 

“Will that be a single bed or double?”

“Single will do just fine.”

“Sounds Good sir, give me one second.” The man waited as the woman flipped through a clipboard, stopping at the fourth page. “Will the third floor be good?” 

“Sounds good.”

“Alright…” Pulling a pen from below the desk and marking off a box- If I can have you sign here, it’ll be ten a night.” holding out the pen.

The man signed as she continued: “Cleaning comes by every day, breakfast is included, if you need anything just come by the front desk.” When he finished signing, the woman reached back and grabbed a single key off a hook.

The man exchanged a warm smile for the girl's plastic-like employee beam, took the key in hand and made his way to the stairs on the other side of the entrance floor. 

The man let out an “excuse me” as he passed Leila, who hardly had recognized his presence at all. It was not until after he had passed that Leila felt an oddly large after-draft. It was not enough to even break past her subconscious.

\#

The man, briefcase in hand, began up the stairs. His mind was running a mile a minute. In his head he kept repeating a cadence for his breaths reminiscent of yoga breathing techniques. *In and out* he told himself you’re *going to be okay*. He put one foot in front of the other and made his way up, step by step, as he felt sweat start to make itself known in the pits of his shirt, and his lower back.

*It's no big deal, just keep moving,* he told himself. But in the back of his mind, like a memory as old as you can put a finger on, there was something else. Something that felt like it was clawing in the faintest of his subconscious. He knew not what this entailed but he knew not to lend it the moment a thought. He felt whatever was within him raging to let free, and he felt fire on his ankles, mutts, no: hellhounds nipping at his pant legs. 

Lost in thought, or rather concentration, he found himself at the top of the stairs. He could not tell if the trip up the stairs had finished too fast or had lasted hours with how engorged his mind was with itself. 

By the time he reached his floor his mind had managed to wander once again. He felt like a man with a gunshot wound, walking himself to the hospital, trying not to rattle about too much so as to not make the bleeding worse. 

Now he stood in the long, blue-carpeted hallway, packing his thoughts away once more, he marched to the door labeled 309. With some shaking, the door clicked unlocked and he swung it open. The room was painfully normal: it had sand colored carpeting, and a window covered by curtains of a similar tan, only made apparent to be not white by the crisp white of the bed which lay in the center of the room, having a red comforter folded upon it that stood out in the room as one of the only places of intense color. There was not much else to it: A small wooden table in the back corner of the room, a wooden chair perhaps to go with it, though it sat across the room in the corner. There was a small nightstand and a cheap lamp upon it that later would show it did work, though half the light was blotted by moths and other insects that had once believed it to be their refuge. There was a brown-ish stain on the ground: a guest must have spilled coffee or something of the sort a while ago- it’d been clearly scrubbed and bleached heavily by the housekeepers (Leila had a personal vendetta against the large blotch) but it remained. The hotel was cheap enough- he wasn't here for a luxury trip anyway. There was a bathroom to the left of the entrance that was truly nothing special itself: its tan color and lighting matching the rest of the room. 

The man stood looking into the room in a piercing moment of sobriety. What a normal room it was, what a future he knew it held.

He set his briefcase on the bed and pulled up the wooden chair to sit beside it. His right temple pounded painfully, he popped several pills of Aspirin into his mouth, swallowing before they started to dissolve. Opening the briefcase, it appeared normal, there was a newspaper off to the side, two or three outfits seemingly taking up most of the space. He reached into the suitcase, grabbing the clothes and setting them aside. With them removed, one could see the contents of the case. Inside sat a small snub-nosed revolver, a cassette tape, a cassette player boombox, a lighter, a flask, a roll of tape, a charcoal pencil, a rudimentary clay bowl, and several loose sheets of paper. The man looked down at the peculiar line up of items, his eyes dancing over every one of them. He let out a hefty exhale, pushing a thumb and forefinger into the bridge of his nose, wishing the aspirin would kick in sooner. 

He reached down, untying and kicking off his shoes then undoing his belt. He reached for the roll of tape, shoving it into his pocket. The man picked up the loose sheets of paper from the briefcase, standing up, he grabbed the charcoal stick in the same hand. Dragging the chair to the desk, he sat, set the papers out before him and began drawing with sketchy quick strokes and no reference, an odd collection of squiggles, hard corners, and lines encased in a circle. He lifted the page in the air in front of him, eyes examining his work through the light that managed its way through the still closed curtains beside him, charcoal dust fell from the page like black snow. He noticed a fly buzz across his ear. He set the page aside with a clearing of his throat and began on the next. Within five minutes, all seven sheets had the identical symbol drawn upon them. He stood, papers in hand, and walked sock-footed to the door- locking it realizing he had forgotten to earlier- then raised one of the sheets up to the head of the doorframe. With his other hand he pulled the roll of tape from his pocket, tearing off a section with his teeth. He secured the page to the doorframe, it draped over like a banner, the tan of the paper matching almost perfectly with the color of the door. He walked to the opposite side of the room and repeated the process on the top of the window, then pulled the curtains over them again. Then he pulled up the chair to the edge of the wall, standing atop it to tape another sheet of paper beneath the vent, then again with the vent in the bathroom. The last three sheets he taped beside the shower drain, the sink drain, and the front of the toilet bowl. He paced the small length of the room, looking at his work, wondering if he had overlooked any details. He stifled a cough and walked back to his open bag. 

From the bag he pulled the clay bowl, he went to the sink and filled it with water, some droplets ricocheting onto the paper he just set. He walked slowly back out of the bathroom, careful not to spill the water. He then placed the bowl on the ground beside his bed, got on his knees, then his stomach, and pushed the bowl as far beneath the bed as he could. Pulling himself back to his feet, he reached into the briefcase once more, retrieving the cassette and its player. He went back to the desk and set the player atop it, he inserted the tape, and tapped two buttons. With a click every half a second or so the tape began playing. The man sat back in his chair, hands clasped in his lap. There was a bit of silence and white noise- then a fuzzy voice began to play:

“Heavenly Father, in your sovereign reign and boundless mercy, we seek your protection against all forces that seek to harm. We call upon you, your holy name, your holy spirit, and Saint Michael’s shield to envelop us with your holy light, to cast out any presence or influence that is not of you or-”",1,1752958099.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I'm starting to think that God himself wishes my downfall. I've had the worst day of my life and I am not exaggerating. The first sign that i should have just called in sick is when I spilled my coffee all over my new white shirt and only clean pair of pants. The next is that is sent my ""I love you baby"" text to my boss instead of my girlfriend. Perhaps, shredding the pile of documents I needed to sign by the end of the day instead of the pile of paper I was supposed to dispose of was just the cherry on the sunday. So here I am 2 minutes after midnight and I've missed the last train home. ""Great, this is just what I needed. I am already running on two hours of mediocre sleep and now I am stuck in this city, unable to go home. I guess I'll just go sleep next to the homeless man that hogs the bench until the next train comes"" I said out loud, knowing nobody was listening to me (aside from that homeless guy I mentioned earlier). I walked closer to the wall and sat down. Putting my vest between my shoulder and head to create a ""pillow"" as well as using my coat like a blanket, I drifted of to sleep. Atleast, that was until I heard a grating voice beside me.
-Hey man, are you new in town? It's the first time I see you camping in the station, asked the stranger.
Great, just what I needed just another house less weirdo that's going to steal my only opportunity of visiting dreamland this evening.
-Leave me alone, I grunted still closing my eyes, im not camping here I just missed my train.
-Than, why didn't you rent a hotel room?
-Because I don't have that kind of money right now, I said, getting more and more annoyed with our conversation.
-You could've gone back to your place in a taxi or an uber, it's less expensive than an hotel room.
-Like I said, I don't have money right now. So you can leave. I'm not givin you anything.
-You're in a suit, so I assume you have a pretty good job. You must have made really bad financial decisions to end up broke like that.
-Okay, can you shut the fuck up-
As the sentence exited my mouth, I opened my eyes and realized I was not talking to homeless man. I was talking to a very Clown with a flowery bowl hat.
-Why...why are you dressed like a Clown? I questionned, confused and concerned.
-Why not, exclamed the smilling flower on his hat? But you did not answer my question about your financial situation. What happened?
-Well uhm... I can't- I can't believe I'm going to talk to you about this but he'll, here I go, I declared exasperated by my own decisions. I have a really bad drinking problem, and my wife is divorcing me because of it. And between the legal fees and the bills I rack up every night at Tony's bar, it's beginning to weight on me. I am becoming a pauper. And now I am stuck here until give AM with a Clown.
-You know there's a train at 25 O'clock, right?
-What are you talking about? 25 O'clock? That doesn't exist.
-Yes it exists! responded the flower, offended I didn't believe it. You are just to drunk to remember the 25th hour. Look man, the train is coming right now. A train suddenly arrived at the station, just as the flower spoke it's words.
-Wow, this is perfect! I didn't know that train existed! Thank you so much, you're a life saver mister flower!
I sprinted towards the train and I jumped aboard. But, I suddenly felt myself falling and my head hit violently the rails. I felt the ground rumble and a real train approaching. As my world started fading, I heard my hallucination talk to me one last time.

Finding a coffee that satisfies both your taste buds and your values isn't always easy, but the Green Mountain Coffee Roasters 5000053703 Caramel Vanilla Cream K-Cups have me hooked. As someone who starts their day with coffee like clockwork, testing this product has been an absolute treat. These single-serve pods promise a swirl of buttery caramel, creamy vanilla, and toasty brown sugar, all combined in a light roast that’s gentle yet flavorful. Initially skeptical about how well these flavors would come through, I was pleasantly surprised and, dare I say, fully caffeinated.  

**Flavor Explosion: Caramel Vanilla Bliss**  
What really stands out in these K-Cups is the flavor profile. Drinking this coffee feels like a decadent dessert in beverage form. The buttery caramel is rich without being overpowering, and the vanilla provides a creamy undertone that’s perfectly complemented by subtle hints of brown sugar. Every sip manages to remain light and refreshing, thanks to its roast level. As a fan of both flavored coffee and sweet treats, this pod nailed the balance between indulgence and drinkability. Even for those who lean toward bolder roasts, the depth of flavor here keeps it satisfying without feeling overly sweet or artificial.

**Sustainability: A Guilt-Free Sip**  
One feature I really appreciated was the brand's commitment to sustainability. Knowing that this coffee is 100% responsibly sourced by the end of 2020 adds a sense of satisfaction beyond the taste. In today’s world, finding products that align with eco-friendly values is more critical than ever, and this effort genuinely resonates with me. It’s comforting that enjoying this cup doesn’t come at a significant environmental cost, a feat rarely emphasized in coffee pods.

**Performance and Compatibility**  
These genuine Keurig K-Cup pods perform consistently well. With my Keurig, the brewing process was seamless, and the pods left no grounds or residue behind. The single-serve convenience means I don’t have to brew an entire pot, and each pod guarantees the same rich flavor every time. I also tested it with my coworker's Keurig coffee maker, and the performance was just as smooth. Whether brewed as a quick morning drink or as a mid-afternoon treat, these pods deliver quality.  

**Favorable Attributes**  
- Rich caramel and vanilla flavors create a dessert-like experience.  
- Light roast ensures you don't feel overwhelmed while still tasting each note.  
- Compatible with all Keurig K-Cup coffee machines, ensuring hassle-free brewing.  
- 100% responsibly sourced coffee aligns with modern sustainability expectations.  

**Packaging and Design**  
I tend to judge a product based on its usability, and the Green Mountain K-Cups score high here, too. The packaging is well-thought-out, keeping the pods intact, fresh, and odor-free. The pods fit snugly in my Keurig with no plastic tearing issues (a common headache with cheaper pods). Although not biodegradable, the brand’s responsible sourcing efforts partially offset this drawback.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The light roast might not be enough for those used to a strong, bold coffee flavor.  
- Non-biodegradable pods could be a drawback for those prioritizing zero-waste options.  
- Artificial flavors, while subtle, might be less appealing to purists who prefer unflavored coffee.

**Taste vs. Competitors**  
When compared to popular alternatives like Dunkin’ Donuts French Vanilla K-Cups or Starbucks Caramel K-Cups, the Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla Cream strikes a brilliant balance between sweetness and subtlety. Starbucks tends to run bolder, with deep caramel notes that can overwhelm the vanilla essence. Dunkin,’ though smoother, lacks the layered complexity. Green Mountain excels with a light roast that emphasizes an aromatic and flavorful drinking experience.  

People who value sustainable coffee practices might also lean toward this choice over brands that don’t strictly advertise responsibly sourced beans. However, if you’re after a punch of caffeine with bold undertones, other competitors like the Peet’s K-Cups might edge out. 

**Price Worthiness**  
The price point feels justified given the taste, convenience, and sustainable sourcing. While some might find these slightly pricier than generic single-serve pods, the quality is evident in every cup brewed. It's the type of coffee pod that suits a mix of occasions—whether you're hosting brunch or just trying to elevate your typical morning routine. Given everything these pods offer, their value is undeniable for anyone who craves indulgent, gourmet-level coffee at home without needing an elaborate setup.

My boyfriend and I are on vacation. His mom was cat sitting for him. His cat was around 10 years old. We’ve been dating almost two years. I loved his cat like he was my own. He got a call two days ago that his cat passed away. His parents dog attacked his cat and also his mom’s cat. They both died. His parents have 3 outside dogs. One has killed a cat in the past. A stray cat in the yard. Their cat was inside outside and learned to only go in the backyard. They keep the back yard and front yard separated by fence. But the most aggressive dog can sneak in the house because she figured out to get the storm door open. I guess that is how it happened. His mom feels guilty of course and is sorry. 

I’m so angry. My boyfriend isn’t because it’s his mom. He knows it wasn’t on purpose. I know that too. But I hurt so badly for him. And for what those cats went through. She knew this dog had killed before. I’m an animal lover. I have my own dog. But I feel like this dog should be put down. That won’t ever happen though. 

My boyfriend seems to be handling things well. Idk how. He rescued him when he was a year old. It had been just then two for years. He loved him so much. I loved him too. Now I dread going home and seeing his things. His food. His litter box. His toys. His brush. All his things. I get so anxious thinking about what he and the other cat went through that led to their death. I get anxious thinking about how my boyfriend is feeling. I keep randomly crying about it. My boyfriend doesn’t feel like discussing it further and I understand that’s how he is with his emotions. I just don’t know what to do with this. My boyfriend has a picture sticker on his coffee cup and every time I see it my eyes well up and I feel sick. 

Edit* i am looking for advice as to how to move past this? I don’t intend on ever voicing my opinion on this matter bc it’s not my place. I also want to say I love my boyfriend’s parents. They are wonderful, and I feel awful for my boyfriend’s mom as well because I know she is crushed. ",2,1752957829.0,Advice,2,0.76,False

1m46gnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1m46gnb/the_last_debate/,The Last Debate,"Last word from the topside crew hadn’t been promising. Tensions were still rising, no one ready to stand down. The blockade had lasted only two days, but both sides had already lost drones, a Japanese destroyer was dead in the water, and someone—no one would say who—had jammed the satellite feeds to half the region. That was yesterday. This morning, four Taiwanese fishing boats tried to break through the so-called exclusion zone. One didn’t make it. A direct hit, they said, from a Chinese corvette. The U.S. escort opened fire seconds later. The Eastern Fleet scrambled jets. Half of Tokyo’s subways shut down “as a precaution.” 

And in the bunker, the standby key light turned amber. 

Each pair that descended to begin their shift did so with a growing sense of dread—dread that they might be the ones forced to turn the keys. Lieutenant Cassian Mirek was no exception, though he betrayed nothing outwardly. His face remained stern and composed. Major Silas Wren, who would spend the next twenty-four hours alongside him in the tight confines of the bunker, also tried to mask his unease, but with less success—his right eyelid wouldn’t stop twitching. Mirek brushed it off. They knew each other well, just not as well as they would by the time this night was over.

The heavy blast door shut behind them with a deep, hydraulic sigh, followed by the metallic *clunk* of locking pins sliding into place. For a moment, silence. Then the fluorescent panels overhead hummed back to life, casting a flat, sterile light over the bunker’s cramped interior.

The capsule wasn’t large—maybe twelve meters long and barely four across—but it felt smaller still beneath the low ceiling and clusters of pale green control consoles that lined the curved walls. Every surface was built for function, not comfort. The air smelled faintly of ozone, steel, and old plastic, like an unused hospital wing sealed for decades. Somewhere behind the panels, a coolant fan whined steadily.

Mirek stepped forward first, his boots striking the metal floor with practiced rhythm. He slid into the left seat, flipping the safety cover on his terminal and running a gloved finger down the authentication panel. His motions were crisp, automatic—muscle memory drilled a thousand times. The amber standby light blinked in the corner of the screen, pulsing like a heartbeat.

Wren followed behind more slowly, rubbing his fingers together as if trying to shake off the cold that hadn’t left his skin since they came down. He eased into the right-side chair, adjusting the strap on his shoulder harness before glancing up at the ceiling. There was a small, recessed camera lens embedded above the launch console, blinking red. Topside was still watching, for now.

“System check,” Mirek said flatly, not looking over.

Wren exhaled and keyed in his side of the protocol. Green lines scrolled across both screens. He blinked twice, trying to ignore the persistent twitch in his eyelid.

“Clear,” he muttered.

Mirek nodded once. Then nothing for a while, just the soft drone of power, the occasional crackle of static from the comms, and the sense that every hour ahead would pass like a century. The routine was the same as always: authenticate the shift change, confirm command link integrity, run diagnostics on launch systems, check the hardline to STRATCOM, review the maintenance logs, and input the daily status codes. Each step was dictated by a laminated checklist secured to the console with yellowing Velcro. Even the tone of their voices during verification had to follow script. Neutral, rehearsed, detached. Wren recited his part as though from muscle memory, his fingers dancing over keys that clacked with an outdated stiffness. Mirek barely looked up, reviewing readiness readouts from the missile fields—flight paths, environmental conditions, alert statuses. All green. All quiet. 

Beneath the surface, anxiety held them in a quiet vise. It showed in the details. Mirek, who usually couldn’t go an hour without mentioning his two-year-old daughter, said nothing. And Wren—who always had a joke on standby, some dry quip to cut the tension—had gone still, his humor shelved like it was radioactive. The small talk that filled other shifts had shrunk to fragments, just enough to avoid the silence, but never enough to remind them of the world above.

Between tasks, they filled time as best they could. A manual with emergency override scenarios lay open on the side table, its corners curled from years of flipping. A chessboard magnetic enough to stick during a seismic shock had been set aside with a half-finished game from the previous shift. Wren absentmindedly moved a knight while waiting for the next hourly comms check. Mirek sipped reconstituted coffee from a stainless steel mug and made a note in the paper log. Wren finally spoke, his voice carrying something between resignation and relief—like a weight he’d been waiting to lift for hours. “I used to go fishing at a lake when I was a kid.”

“That so?” Mirek said, idly spinning a ballpoint pen between his fingers.

“Mhm.” Wren gave a small nod. “It was peaceful but kind of thrilling, too. Every day after school, I’d grab this old wooden rod and run straight to the lake. No reel, no tackle box—just a string and a hook, you know?”

“Sounds like a good memory,” Mirek said, setting the pen down and finally meeting Wren’s eyes.

“It was,” Wren said quietly. “It really was. Until they started dumping waste into the water. Poisoned everything. Killed the fish. I never went back after that.”

“Ah,” Mirek said, the word thin and unsatisfying. He searched for something better, something that didn’t sound like a placeholder, but came up empty. Wren’s story had stirred something, reminded him of his daughter, waiting for him beneath an X on some secret Chinese map of the continental U.S.

“Don’t you think that’s a good metaphor for the world?” Wren asked, leaning back slightly in his chair. “Of civilization?”

“A metaphor?” Mirek hesitated, unsure if this was a trap or just conversation. “I suppose one could see it that way.”

Wren rubbed at his twitching eyelid. “If the order comes—if we end up being the ones who turn the keys—I’ll be thinking of that lake.”

“How so?” Mirek asked, the image of his daughter flickering again in his mind. That’s who he’d be thinking of.

“I don’t know,” Wren said, then paused, searching for the right words. “We were never particularly good to the planet, were we? Maybe something better comes after us. Maybe that lake comes back someday. Maybe turning those keys wouldn’t just be an ending, but a beginning too.”

Mirek chuckled. “Sounds like post-rationalization to me.”

“Maybe it is,” Wren said. “Still might be true… I don’t want to get long-winded or start philosophizing too much—especially not on a night like this, running on fumes. But…” He glanced at his watch. “We’ve got time to kill, so I might as well try to make my point.”

“I’m all ears,” Mirek said. “Care for a game of chess?”

They rolled their chairs over to the magnetic board. Wren reset the pieces and picked up the thread as he moved a pawn to c4. “We originated in Africa,” he said, adjusting a bishop. “Rich land, boundless life, and kin species beside us in the Homo line. For two hundred thousand years, we lived within balance, part of an ecosystem that shaped us as much as we shaped it. But in the last ten thousand, we’ve drifted. We’ve turned deserts into fields, felled forests like enemies, extracted from the web that once held us.” He tapped the board gently, eye twitching again. “And now? Now we’ve become a parasite on our own planet. A clever one, yes—but no less expendable. If Earth decides to shake us off, I’m not sure I would complain.”

Mirek moved his pawn to e6. “What about all the innocent people? The women, the children, the civilians? Are they fleas too?”

“Not from our limited human perspective,” Wren said, voice low. “Of course I’d grieve them. I’d grieve all of it.” He rested his fingers on the edge of the board, then made his move: Knight to f3. “But from a wider vantage point… something colder, older—maybe balance matters more than mercy.”

Mirek watched the board for a moment, then looked back at Wren. “I’m not sure anything can even be imbalanced from an impersonal view,” he said. “Imbalance for one individual might be perfect harmony for someone else.” He tried to smile, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes. The dread, buried somewhere deeper, had begun to show through.

“I’m talking about the perspective of Earth,” Wren said, watching Mirek’s hand as he moved his pawn to d5. “The perspective of life itself.” He picked up a pawn, turned it slowly between his fingers, then placed it on d4, facing Mirek’s pawn. “We were handed ideal conditions. A world that worked. And look at it now. We've mistaken complexity for progress, but tell me—has it made life better? Or just better for us, and worse for everything else? And even for us… has it really improved anything at all?” He gave a dry, bitter laugh. “Probably not the most popular viewpoint, I know. But hey—if you can’t say what you really think at the edge of Armageddon, when can you?”

“By all means,” Mirek said, moving his knight to f6. “Don’t hold back—I can take it.”

“To me,” Wren went on, “this notion that we’ll ascend to godhood before we implode—like some of those tech billionaires believe—it’s delusional. Pure hubris, dressed up as destiny.” He studied the board for a moment, then moved his knight to c3. “There’s a ceiling to growth,” he said. “You can only strip the world for so long before it demands payment. And that bill always comes due.”

“And here we are,” Mirek said, “mere invoicing clerks, ready to deliver our client’s bill to the rest of humanity.” He shook his head and placed his bishop at e7. “Personally, I don’t think we ought to pay that bill.”

“What do you suggest?” Wren asked, studying the board.

“Here’s how I see it…” Mirek said, watching Wren finally move his bishop to c4. “The only morally important aspect of the world is the amount of suffering in it. If you accept that premise, you also have to acknowledge that only individuals can suffer.” Mirek paused, then nudged his bishop to g5.

“Go on,” Wren said, and made his move: castles kingside.

Mirek, a bit hesitant to speak so frankly with his superior, finally said, “Something bad can only happen to an ecosystem or a species if the conscious beings within it suffer as a result.” He moved a pawn to e3. ”As a whole an ecosystem or species doesn't carry any value that supersede the value of the individuals. Add to this that nature doesn't promote happiness, it's a rare sensation that occurs when needs are met, motivating organisms to strive for that state—which again, is rare.”

“Of all Earth’s creatures, none has spread more suffering than humanity,” Wren said. “If you include the suffering of animals—I’m not a vegan or anything, but… well, if you count all that, humanity is most definitely the worst culprit in the sense you’re talking about.” He slid a pawn to h6.

“That might be so,” Mirek said. “For now…” He paused, thinking. ”Suffering,” he continued, ”has evolved to motivate organisms to avoid scarcity and danger—it’s the rule in nature.” Growing less restrained, he added, ”Untouched nature is a net negative for the most important aspect of life. Humanity might have made it worse for a couple of centuries, for sure, but we've only turned up the heat in hell slightly due to our collective attempt at escaping hell altogether—something that will only be possible with sapiens.”

”This sounds noble,” Wren said calmly, though his eyelid kept betraying his anxiety. “But it’s just ego—this belief that we can save the world by piling on more complexity, building more systems, burning more fuel. We’re not fixing the mess. Hell, we’re still making it. And the only problems worth solving are the ones we caused. Not that we’re anywhere close to doing that, either.”

Mirek studied the board, considering where to place his bishop, and nodded slowly. “If humanity went extinct, life on Earth would become a nightmare for almost every conscious creature,” he said, finally placing the piece at h4. “And it would stay that way until everything ends a billion years from now, when the sun finally renders the planet uninhabitable. Humanity is the only chance we have to shift that trajectory—to turn a net negative into a net positive and rescue life from the slow death of the expanding sun. Wishing for our extinction is wishing for a billion years of guaranteed suffering. Sure, a few species might survive a little longer without us—but it wouldn’t benefit anyone.” He looked up at Wren, trying to manage a smile.

“Trying to bend nature to our will in the name of ending suffering—it’s a fool’s errand at best,” Wren said, wiping sweat from his forehead, “at worst, it’s slow torture for everything that breathes.” He placed a pawn at b6. “Earth’s been running a four-billion-year operation without us just fine. The notion that we, in our brief moment of modernity, know what’s best for the rest of it… it’s absurd. Truth is, we’ve drifted so far from nature we can’t even see the full extent of the damage we’ve caused.”

Mirek shook his head, a bit dismissively but with a friendly smile—he didn’t want to come off as confrontational. “We know that animals, like humans, try to avoid suffering. So it’s not hard to imagine what most individuals, of any species, would prefer.” Mirek casually slid his pawn to d5, capturing one of Wren’s.  “Yes, figuring out how to achieve well-being for all is incredibly difficult. But nature’s randomness and indifference won’t solve it. At least humans have the potential to offer something better in the long run. What you’re suggesting guarantees meaningless suffering—for everyone.”

“Who’s to say suffering is the only moral concern? That’s a premise you introduced—and I’m not sure I buy it.” His hand hovered over a pawn, then shifted to his knight, using it to capture Mirek’s pawn at d5. “Meaning and purpose—they can carry a creature through almost any kind of pain. But without them, even comfort becomes a kind of hell. Take the factory-farmed pig. It’s fed, watered, kept alive—so on paper, its suffering looks minimal. But its instincts? Crushed. No space to roam, no chance to act on what it was built to do. Just a cage, packed with thousands like it. Existing, not living.” He paused, watching as Mirek replaced his bishop with his own at e7. “You could say the same about us,” he continued. “We weren’t made for cubicles and concrete—we were built for forests. To hunt, build fires, sing, raise children, and feel some kind of connection to the world around us. Sure, it would’ve been brutal at times—but it had meaning. Now? We work to feed systems we don’t control, chasing paychecks to line someone else’s pocket.” He used his queen to capture Mirek’s bishop at e7. “We call it progress. But somewhere along the way, we traded purpose for comfort—and lost nearly everything that made us human.”

“It’s easy for you to say nature is beautiful—sitting here with electricity keeping you warm—while animals out there struggle just to survive the winter.” Mirek paused, glancing toward the consoles as if he’d heard something. “But there is no divine purpose. No glory in how they live or die. Their lives are just the result of natural selection—shaped not for their well-being, but for aimless reproduction, serving no higher end.” He moved his knight to d5, capturing Wren’s knight. “Life on Earth is a perpetual suffering machine. We aren’t ‘meant’ to do anything. Evolution doesn’t care about us—it shapes only our ability to survive and reproduce. You, me—we’re nothing but disposable tools in a blind, bloody process, forced to carry out our programming under nature’s whip.”

Wren gave a quiet laugh. “Let’s see here.” He leaned over the board, hesitated for a moment, then moved a pawn to d5, capturing Mirek’s knight with deliberate care. “Well, I agree,” he continued, “I wouldn’t last a day out there if you dropped me in the wild. This isn’t a call to return to the woods. It’s a critique of what we’ve built. If I’d been born into that older life—living by the land—I’d have taken it as truth. I’d have learned to endure. Loss, pain, hunger, death—those would’ve been part of the rhythm. Hard, yes. But real. Now? We sanitize everything. Strip life of the very things that make joy and meaning possible. And I have to ask: is that an improvement? Or are you just removing what makes the experience of being alive feel real? Loss, suffering, joy, happiness—they ebb and flow. Can you even have the second two without the first?”

Mirek nodded, eyes fixed on the board. “If suffering can exist without happiness—which it clearly can, just think of people with chronic depression or those living through tragedy without ever catching a break before they die—then I see no logical reason why happiness couldn’t exist without suffering. But fine, I’ll grant you that some emotional variation might be necessary. Happiness isn’t uninterrupted bliss—it’s the right mix of feelings that leave us content, combined with the absence of the ones we’d rather avoid entirely. Like a toothache with no dentist. Or being eaten alive by parasites. All lovely gifts of nature.” He moved his rook to c1.

“And yet,” Wren said, “I’d give anything to escape this bunker—to escape this degenerate society where meaning has been replaced by an endless social media feed, pumping our brains full of dopamine but offering no substance. I’d trade it all to return to ancient Earth—to explore, to hunt, to gather with a tribe at my side—even if it meant dying from a scratch. I’m a great ape, goddammit. I was meant to run—through forests, across deserts—not to sit buried under tons of concrete like some Greek god with my hands on the keys to the apocalypse.”

He picked up his bishop, but just as he was about to place it back on the board, a sharp electronic tone cut through the silence, shrill and unmistakable. The launch console blinked red. Both men snapped to attention. FLASH MESSAGE – EAM INBOUND. Emergency Action Message. No simulation prefix. The printer spat out its coded strip like a lifeline from hell. Mirek snatched it up, eyes scanning the cipher groups, hands suddenly not as steady as they’d been all day. Wren opened the laminated decoding card, laying it flat against the console. No one spoke. They moved in sync. The launch book came out of its drawer. Pages flipped. The code matched. It was real.

Wren stared at the red panel in front of him, the one he’d stared at every shift for years, always cold and hypothetical. It now glowed with meaning. Mirek reached under the console and pulled out the launch keys. Wren did the same. Both sets were attached to chains bolted to the frame, long enough to reach, but only if two people turned them simultaneously.

Mirek inserted his key, his fingers stiff, almost numb. Across the console, he watched Wren do the same. Their eyes met. Wren’s twitch was gone—his face had settled into something stiller, heavier. A quiet sadness had taken hold.

“I’m sorry about your kid,” he said softly. “I truly am.”

Mirek nodded. “I hope your lake returns when the sky clears.”

He pictured taking his daughter there. Someday. In another life.

And then, together, they turned the keys.

This coffee maker boasts an impressive feature set with its innovative MultiStream Technology, designed to extract flavor and aroma evenly from every K-Cup pod. I’m someone who loves a robust cup of coffee in the morning, and this machine didn’t disappoint in that department. Right from the unboxing, it was clear that the modern, sleek design in black with a compact form factor would easily fit on most kitchen counters, occupying only limited space. While there’s a lot to love, this device isn’t without its quirks, so let’s dive into the details.

**Design and Build Quality**

This machine screams minimalism, and its black modern aesthetic paired perfectly with the look of my kitchen. Its dimensions, 7.05 x 17.91 x 14.41 inches, make it compact enough to fit under standard kitchen cabinets. I found the controls, which are simple buttons, intuitive even for someone like me who prefers things straightforward. The removable 66-ounce dual-position reservoir is a standout feature, allowing for easy refills and placements that adapt to counter space. At just 5.9 pounds, it’s relatively lightweight, enabling easy relocation if needed. While the build quality feels sturdy, I did notice that the removable tank, though convenient, could feel slightly less durable than I’d like.

**Features That Work for a Variety of Coffee Preferences**

Customizability is where this coffee maker shines. I loved having the option to brew 6, 8, 10, or 12-ounce cups, making it perfect for those days when I wanted to nurse a large drink or simply enjoy a quick shot of caffeine. Additionally, the option to brew with ground coffee using My K-Cup Universal Filter (sold separately) is a nod to those who don’t want to be limited to pods. Choosing between a robust brew or brewing over ice for a refreshingly cold drink was simple thanks to the dedicated Strong button. Testing out the iced coffee option, I brewed hot coffee over ice, and the taste remained full-bodied—an impressive feat for a single-serve machine.

**Highlights**

- MultiStream Technology ensures even flavor and aroma extraction.
- Custom brewing sizes (6, 8, 10, and 12 oz) accommodate different preferences.
- Includes a Strong button for intense coffee lovers.
- Dual-position reservoir optimizes counter space.
- Fast brewing – I had my coffee in under two minutes.

**Performance and Ease of Use**

Day-to-day operation of the Keurig K-Supreme is delightfully simple. I had no trouble mastering the buttons within minutes of setting it up. The machine brews fast, averaging just a couple of minutes per cycle, which is a lifesaver during busy mornings. The coffee consistently maintained the rich flavor one expects from high-quality brewing. However, I did notice that the machine’s pod puncture mechanism, while functional, sometimes needed a firmer hand to ensure proper puncturing. Cleanup couldn’t have been easier, as the removable reservoir and drip tray simplified the process immensely.

**Strengths**

- Fast brewing for people in a hurry.
- User-friendly controls appeal to tech novices.
- Compatibility with pods and ground coffee increases versatility.
- Compact and lightweight.
- Great for iced coffee fans.

**Drawbacks**

- Pod puncture system occasionally requires extra effort.
- Plastic components may feel less premium.
- Larger mugs may struggle to fit without tray removal.

**Peer Products**

The Keurig K-Supreme comes face-to-face with several competing coffee makers in this category, notably the Nespresso VertuoPlus and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. The Nespresso VertuoPlus emphasizes barista-style espresso brewing and has a more premium stainless-steel finish, but it comes with steeper costs and no option for ground coffee. On the other hand, Hamilton Beach FlexBrew enables both single-serve and full-pot brewing, making it appealing for larger households. However, its brewing speed and flavor extraction lag behind. The K-Supreme strikes a balance by offering advanced flavor technologies in an affordable yet premium-feeling package, proving superior in rapid brewing and pod versatility.

**Price Performance**

Analyzing its features relative to its price, this coffee maker lands in the sweet spot for single-serve machines. Fast brewing, adjustable settings, and high-quality flavor output make it worth the investment. Given it supports pods and ground coffee, it feels like you’re getting two machines in one. Competitors often limit you to pods or make brewing overly complicated. Without revealing specific costs, I’d say this coffee maker is a middle-ground solution for budget-conscious coffee enthusiasts who want reliable performance.

I’m now living in Cape Town for my first year of med school. It’s a huge step and while I expected it to be tough, I didn’t think I’d feel THIS lonely sometimes.

I’m pretty introverted by nature. I really enjoy deep conversations and quiet hangs more than big social scenes, which makes it harder to break into groups where everyone already knows each other. I’ve tried chatting to people on campus but it always feels like I’m intruding on an existing clique, so I end up back in my room or studying alone.

I’d love to find someone who gets this. If you’re also feeling a bit alone, a bit shy, or just want to make a genuine connection, please reach out! We could chat about anything, vent about uni stress, or even meet up for a coffee if you’re nearby.

I was also pointed towards Aventura coffee, which, for the record, is fucking brilliant and very well priced. I asked the barista to surprise me with coffee, and she gave me a lemon mint cream cold brew, and I ordered the banana toast alongside it.

But spice? Left a LOT to be desired. The flavors and textures all fell flat on the curry and veg, the lamb lacked just the same, and the cheese naan felt more like a lunchable than actual naan. And considering that I live in a more expensive area and pay less than I do there for better Indian food, this is completely unjustifiable. I miss Taj. For the record, I ordered the coconut Lamb with cheese naan

Allentown I also checked out Mak Daddy's which was decent, but had worse coffee, less interesting menu, and the particular drink I ordered with the black pepper was a giant mistake, but I realize I can't rate them based on my own personal drink order mistake. 

I was brought out to Hoops for the first time and, while I love the courtyard, it's expensive drinking for a dive bar and real nasty customer service, even for a dive. 

For lodging, I stayed at the La Quinta behind target, which was a total gamble because it was really cheap and in a really rough area, but I figured it's new construction would make up for it. I was totally right! 24-hour hot tub and pool, excellent room, excellent customer service. Absolutely no complaints, especially not for the price I paid. 

So 

Aventura Coffee: 10/10

Spice: 4/10

MakDaddy's: 6.5/10

Hoops:4.5/10

La Quinta: 8.5/10

I mean I understand they wanna feel safe before meeting me but what’s wrong about meeting over coffee? Especially when it’s someone I got her number in person, like you already met me.

It’s just frustrating for me, I run out of things to talk about over texts so damn fast, it feels impossible to build a connection and keep texts interesting, at the same time if I ask them out too soon I always get rejected then the conversation dies slowly, I can’t get over this it’s been over a year since I got a date and I just lost my confidence and hope.

Can you help me out with what topics are “texts appropriate” how do I initiate conversations over texts and when is it appropriate to ask out? 
I really don’t have a problem once I meet someone in person, I always got a second and third dates, but recently everyone is expecting texts and IT IS HORRIBLE AND STUPID!

I've been on a major ice cream kick lately, and I wanted to share some cool ways to make it at home without needing any fancy equipment. Don't get me wrong, I love my ice cream maker (I use this one: https://athometouch.com/ice-cream-makers), but sometimes you just want to whip up a quick batch without all the fuss.

So here are a few no-churn methods I've tried that work pretty well:

1. The Ziploc bag method: This one's super easy and fun for kids too. You just mix cream, sugar, and flavoring in a small bag, seal it up, then put that inside a bigger bag filled with ice and salt. Shake it for about 5-10 minutes and boom - ice cream!

2. Whipped cream base: This is my go-to for a quick fix. Whip some heavy cream until stiff, then fold in sweetened condensed milk and whatever mix-ins you want. Freeze for a few hours and you're good to go.

3. Frozen banana ""nice cream"": For a healthier option, blend up frozen bananas with a splash of milk. It gets surprisingly creamy and you can add cocoa powder, peanut butter, or berries to change up the flavor.

4. No-churn coffee ice cream: This one's for you caffeine addicts! Mix cold brew concentrate with sweetened condensed milk and whipped cream. Freeze and enjoy your coffee fix in dessert form.

5. Mason jar method: Similar to the bag technique, but you vigorously shake the ingredients in a mason jar surrounded by ice. Your arms will get a workout, but hey, you earned that ice cream!

These methods are great in a pinch, but if you find yourself making ice cream a lot, it might be worth investing in a machine. They're not as expensive as you might think - check out some options here: https://athometouch.com/ice-cream-makers

The texture from a machine is usually smoother and more like store-bought ice cream. Plus, you can experiment with all kinds of flavors and mix-ins.

Anyone else have any good no-churn ice cream hacks? I'm always looking for new ideas to satisfy my sweet tooth. And if you've got a favorite ice cream recipe (churned or not), definitely share it in the comments!",1,1752957078.0,LivingEssentials,1,1.0,False

( Story behind it - A boy (myself) who fell in love when he wasn’t looking for it and how he felt about it )

**[Spoken Intro]**

""It's funny what you remember. For me, it wasn't in some big crowd or at a party. It was just a quiet moment... in the college sports room. Out of all the faces there, I remember yours. That was the moment my story really began, even though I didn't realize it at the time...""

**[Verse 1]**

Wasn't looking for love when I first saw you,

But you came like a miracle, so true.

From Snapchat texts to midnight calls,

We got close like fate planned it all.

We were scared ,different in faith,

Still promised to fight, whatever it takes.

You became my peace, my daily start,

Slipped right into my broken heart.


**[Pre-Chorus]**

And all your friends they said that I was just a mess,

But you looked past the noise and saw the best, I must confess.

**[Chorus]**

'Cause you're the one I never knew I was waiting for,

You walked right in and opened up a different door.

And all I know is I love you more,

Than anyone I've ever loved before.


**[Verse 2]**

I made you my world, let the others slide,

Loving you - the best part of my life.

I just loved you - that’s all I knew,

Never played games, never lied to you.

Didn’t want your body, didn’t want your face,

I just wanted your love, your time, your space.


**[Pre-Chorus]**

And all your friends they said that I was just a mess,

But you looked past the noise and saw the best, I must confess.


**[Chorus]**

'Cause you're the one I never knew I was waiting for,

You walked right in and opened up a different door.

And all I know is I love you more,

Than anyone I've ever loved before.


**[Verse 3]**

Remember all the nights we'd talk until the sun came up?

Just you and me, the world was in a coffee cup.

You held my hand and told me all your dreams and fears,

The safest I had felt in all my lonely years.


**[Bridge]**

Before you, I was just walking in the dark,

Didn't know my life was waiting for a spark.

You saw the real me, you didn't see the rest,

Just by loving me, you gave me the best.


**[Chorus]**

'Cause you're the one I never knew I was waiting for,

You walked right in and opened up a different door.

And all I know is I love you more,

Than anyone I've ever loved before.


**[Outro]**

The one I never knew I was waiting for...

Yeah... you're the one.


**SONG 2: “The First Fight”**

(story behind it - its when this boy found that she lied about somethings, how she lied to him multiple times, how it felt for him , and how he suffered because of it , )


**[Spoken Intro]**

""The worst part isn't the lie itself. It's the moment right before. When the air gets quiet... and you look at the person you love... and you realize you don't recognize them anymore. Your gut tells you something is wrong... and you know nothing will ever be the same again.""


**[Verse 1]**

The first lie surfaced, and we had our first real fight,

My anger burned so hot all through that lonely night.

You cried and begged and promised me you'd change your ways,

And I agreed to stay with you, to see some better days.

I told you, ""Just be honest,"" that's all I'd ever ask,

I put a broken smile on, I put on my loving mask.


**[Pre-Chorus]**

And I wanted to believe you, I wanted it so bad,

To get back to the only love that I had ever had.


**[Chorus]** 

I gave you a second chance, but it wasn't for you,

It was for me, to see if my love was true.

I had to swallow all my pride and all the pain,

And learn how to trust in you all over again.


**[Verse 2]**

A couple months went by, I thought that we were good,

Then the real truth came out, and I finally understood.

That first whole story, it was all a lie again,

And my heart shattered right there and then.

I told you, ""We are over, I can't do this anymore,""

But you just cried and begged me right there on the floor.

Said "" Venky…baby, I will never lie to you again""


**[Pre-Chorus]**

And I wanted to believe you, I wanted it so bad,

To get back to the only love that I had ever had.


**[Chorus]**

I gave you a second chance, but it wasn't for you,

It was for me, to see if my love was true.

I had to swallow all my pride and all the pain,

And learn how to trust in you all over again.


**[Bridge]**

I cried alone those nights, you never even knew,

The hell that I was quietly going through.

My hands would start to shake, my heart would start to pound,

And I just needed something to quiet down the sound.

So I started smoking weed to kill the doubt and pain,

To stop the looping thoughts that drove my heart 
insane.

It helped me trust you more and see a future there,

And let me love you deeper, it let me truly care.


**[Chorus]**

I gave you a second chance, but it wasn't for you,

It was for me, to see if my love was true.

I had to swallow all my pride and all the pain,

And learn how to trust in you all over again.


**[Outro]**

All over again...

How do you trust... all over again?

1m466l1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m466l1,Could a BRT Line down Sunset Boulevard be a solution to bringing rapid transit to Dodger Stadium?,"As some of you may or may not know, Dodger Stadium, one of the most famous baseball stadiums in Major League Baseball, has a notorious traffic problem.  Part of the reason is the road design into the stadium, and the stadium is notoriously surrounded by a massive parking lot.  While there is the Dodger Stadium Express, it's really only a band-aid solution, especially since the commute back has to run in traffic and doesn't have its own dedicated right of way.

One potential solution I had in mind was building a Bus Rapid Transit line down Sunset Boulevard, with a stop at Sunset/Vin Scully, where commuters can then walk to the stadium from there, which is only about half a mile from the bus stop.  LA already has plans to build a bus lane and protected bike lane down Sunset Boulevard under Measure HLA, and most of the work for a BRT is typically the bus lane and signal priority, right?  So why not just go all the way, and eventually down the line we could potentially convert the BRT into a light rail even?  I was thinking having lanes run in center of Sunset instead of curbside lanes, dedicated stops, level boardings, off-board fare collections, the whole nine yards.

The only downside to this is that Vin Scully Avenue is fairly steep and difficult to go up, especially for those with disabilities or families.  Some solutions I had in mind was to build a moving walkway like those you see in airports on Vin Scully so that you don't have to walk, and have this new Sunset BRT line supplement the already existing Dodger Stadium Express.  That way, you have full-time 24/7 rapid transit to Dodger Stadium, while at the same time also giving the disabled, elderly, and families a way to get to the stadium without having to climb up Vin Scully Avenue.",9,1752956871.0,transit,1,0.91,False

As someone always hyper-vigilant about personal security, this package intrigued me with its dual-use functionality: a pepper gel canister paired with a doorstop alarm. A setup aimed at safety both at home and on the go, it’s packed with promise. After several weeks of daily testing, both the strengths and quirks of this product became clear.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was how compact and lightweight the pepper gel unit is, weighing just 6.4 ounces. It slipped comfortably into my pocket, feeling almost unnoticeable when clipped to my work bag via the quick-release key ring. The door alarm is equally portable yet sturdy enough to withstand daily wear and tear. Made primarily of plastic, it feels durable without being hefty. While the combination of a sleek black and white color scheme undoubtedly adds to its appeal, I did wish the pepper gel nozzle had a slightly more visible safety indicator. On one hectic morning where my coffee hadn’t kicked in, I found myself triple-checking to be sure it was locked.

**Pepper Gel Performance**  
Having 25 bursts at your disposal is no joke. During my ""controlled testing"" (don’t worry, my plants survived), the gel consistently traveled up to its advertised 12-foot range, well-suited for maintaining a safe distance during emergencies. What sets gel apart from spray is its thicker consistency, which minimizes wind blowback. One afternoon, I tested it in breezy conditions, and the gel stayed on its intended path like a guided missile—it’s both efficient and reassuring. For extra safety, the gel includes a UV marking dye, something I wasn’t initially aware I’d care about until I realized it would make it easier for authorities to identify an attacker post-incident.  

[Check SABRE DSGK-BK-AMZ deals on Amazon now.](https://tooldetective.com/p/b0872j2qm4/)

**Door Alarm Functionality**  
The doorstop alarm became an immediate hit in my house—though not with my cat, who triggered it and nearly jumped out of his whiskers. Setting it up took mere seconds. All you do is wedge it under an inward-swinging door, and should someone apply pressure to the door, the 120dB alarm shrieks loud enough to alert the entire floor. It’s also fantastic for travel; during a hotel stay, it provided an extra layer of security, letting me sleep more soundly in an otherwise unfamiliar environment. However, the need for a 9V battery (not included) felt a tad annoying, especially since I had to rummage through old remotes to find one. A rechargeable option would have been better.

**Strengths**  
- Gel minimizes wind blowback effectively.  
- UV dye adds an extra layer of safety by aiding law enforcement.  
- Door alarm installation is incredibly simple, with no wiring required.  
- Loud enough to alert people at a significant distance.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Pepper gel nozzle could benefit from a clearer safety lock indicator.  
- Requires a 9V battery for the alarm, which isn't included.  

**Who This Kit is For**  
The product seems tailored for both travelers and students, particularly those living on campuses or in apartments. With its lightweight and portable features, it fits easily into a daily carry setup, whether clipped to a purse, attached to a keychain, or tucked into a travel bag. It’s also suitable for household use as the alarm's noise level (120dB) would deter most intruders while alerting neighbors.

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing this safety kit to similar products like the Vipertek stun gun or the Guard Dog pepper sprays, there are notable advantages and trade-offs. Stun guns like Vipertek can seem more threatening but require close contact, which not everyone may feel comfortable with. Meanwhile, Guard Dog sprays often lack the gel component, making them more susceptible to wind blowback in outdoor settings. What makes this combination kit stand out is the added door alarm, which offers a layer of home or travel security not typically included in other products.

**Smart Spending**  
In terms of affordability, the kit offers decent cost-effectiveness by bundling both a pepper gel and a door alarm. Split into individual purchases, buying these tools separately would easily add up, making the package a more wallet-friendly option. It strikes a good balance between price and utility while providing peace of mind for daily use.

Throughout the book he seems to use the same metaphors and similes in slightly different ways over and over and over again. If you know what to look for, the repetition becomes rather obvious. Here are a bunch of the themes he repeats, in no particular order.

1. Christmas/pine trees/pine needles
2. The color red/heart/tomatoes

13. Storms/thunder/lighting
14. Raccoons/snakes/animals
15. Movies/theater/performance

I believe this to be intentional as they're repeated consistently. Almost like he was looking at a list of ideas he was trying to convey and purposefully checking each one off as he wrote. Don't believe me? Read the sleep study chapter again. A chapter that doesn't have anything to do with treasure hunting and is perhaps dismissed but for some reason is just riddled with these types of metaphors. When you know what to look for it becomes painfully obvious. 

In my opinion these are not only hints to specific locations but also to the methods we are supposed to employ to solve the poem. 

As an example: the color red. Say it out-loud and remember that Colorado literally means the color red. This should give you some context as to the clue he's hinting toward.

Hopefully this is helpful and I know there are more examples but these should get you started if you want to climb down this rabbit hole. Cheers!
