How to get in and stay in!,"Comprehensive tips for starting gym life! The gym can seem like a bit of an intimidating place. As someone who has been a first time gym-goer. I hope this advice is helpful!

**Plan your week.** Incorporate gym time in a way that works for *your* schedule. I recommend trying to carve out 30 minuets to an hour per session. As a beginner, you don't need to be rapped up with how much time you spend at the gym. I highly encourage giving yourself a month to just experiment with your schedule as it will likely change along with the workouts you do. Once you find the routine you like, you will become more efficient and consistent with the time you have. A common misconception is that you need to go to the gym every day or workout for several hours at a time in order to see results. In reality, a couple times a week for 1 hour at most is about all you need, especially for beginners. I currently go to the gym about 3 times a week for 1 hour each session. Based on the exercises I do and my lifestyle, I find this schedule pleasant and progressive. Tips: getting enough sleep and fueling your body should be just as important as incorporating gym time as both of these things can negatively impact your gym life. Ease into it to avoid burnout.

**Shift your mindset.** Make gym time your *FUN* time. Go to a gym *you* feel safe at. Exercise in a way that makes *you* feel good. Wear what *you* feel comfortable in. Experiment with equipment; set up an appointment with a trainer at least once; don't be afraid to ask others for advice. If you're social, be social. If you're anti-social, be anti-social. The gym is for everyone and anyone who makes you feel unsafe or unwelcome should be reported. Tip: Progress is about consistency in the long run so missing a day or week will not hinder you as long as you get back in the next time! I used to have the mindset that I'd ruined my entire month because I'd missed a week or day. This thinking lead to prolonged on and off periods in my fitness journey. To prevent this thinking, I created a ""reset"" day for myself. If I miss a week or day, that's ok because without a doubt, I'd be back in the gym by Monday. This day works for me because I feel well rested after the weekend and feel inspired to start my week strong. This lead to a long-term gym streak that yielded more results and prevented the yo-yo effect.

**Inspiration or getting into the mood can be created.** I've heard people say that you shouldn't wait to feel motivated before going to the gym. There is some truth to this. For example, coffee is what might inspire you to get out of bed, drinking coffee might give you a spurt of energy or dopamine, the sensation of energy or dopamine might get you pumped up about going to the gym. This is just one example of how motivation follows action. So there is some truth to creating a schedule and sticking to it regardless of feeling motivated. But again, the gym should be a *FEEL GOOD* place. If you're always forcing yourself to go to the gym or do workouts you don't enjoy, you will create a negative association with exercise and gym life. It will only get harder and harder to show up. So, rather than forcing yourself to go regardless of motivation, you should find something that *inspires* you to show up. You should find something that *gets* you in the mood. Find what makes you feel excited, frustrated, hopeful, or energized and *use it*. For example, I will put on my workout music *before* my gym time; it gets my heart racing and I begin to imagine the exercises I might do that day. Maybe looking at before and after photos, watching glow up videos, or thinking about family/friends gets you in the mood. Tips: If you find yourself in a very negative headspace, it's ok to leave early. When I'm having a rough day, I will still try my best to show up and get a workout in, but sometimes I'm just feeling awful. I will start with the negative self-talk, get progressively frustrated with exercises that aren't making me feel how I expected them to make me feel, and feel increasingly uncomfortable or out of place at the gym. On days like these, I find it's best to cut my time short and leave with the promise to try again later so that I don't create a negative association with the gym. This helps me to make the gym a reward, and a place of self-care. This method might not work for you. Rather, you might like channeling your negative headspace into a harder workout instead and feel refreshed by the end of it!

**A sense of obligation can help with consistency**. If group classes, working with a trainer, or telling other people about your fitness journey is what makes you feel obligated to show up, then create that atmosphere. For me, weekly journal entries worked the best. I would start my Monday with a journal entry about how I wanted my gym week to go and felt obligated to at least show up so that I could cross dates or tasks off my calendar. If I didn't complete what I'd planned, I would just start fresh with a new week. I found that an *encouraging* and *low* *pressure* sense of obligation helped me with consistency better than a high pressure one.

**Progress and goals can help or hinder.** Goals (can easily be unreasonable and unachievable). Gym-fluences will have you believing that you can achieve your goals in weeks, but fitness goals often require more time and different methods than influencers demonstrate in short videos. So unless you're encouraged by challenges and long term goals, try to set smaller or shorter term goals. For example, the goal to show up, to repeat your last session perfectly, to do a pushup, squat the bar, get closer to touching your toes, balance on one foot for longer, try new equipment, asking that one person or trainer how your form looks. Achievable goals allow for you to feel invigorated when you meet or surpass them, and allows space for you to acknowledge the progress you make. Goals related to loss or gains usually require additional *lifestyle* changes *outside* of the gym so I discourage setting these goals until you've created a positive association with the gym, discovered the exercises you truly enjoy, and have done further scientific based research about how best you can achieve gains or losses. Progress (let it be a side effect rather than an achievement). A sense or feeling of progression and improvement will help you stay consistent, but expecting progress can lead to disheartenment when you don't ""improve"" within a certain timeframe. Avoid putting a time limit on your goal and allow for flexibility. For example, I evaluate my fitness journey every week and re-set my goals based on how last week went or based on new information I've learned.

**Regression**. Rest and recover, sleep, vacations, life events... Regression is natural and you wont 'regress' as fast as you think you will. Missing a day, missing a week, missing 2 weeks. You might not be progressing, but you won't necessarily be regressing at that point. Maybe you miss a month and you do notice that you can't run as far or lift as much. The good news is, your body remembers. It's easier to do it again than it is to start fresh. Some influencers demonstrate how they ""bounce back"" in order to advertise their brand but they aren't usually starting from scratch. Scientifically, their bodies remember the muscle mass they used to have. Behaviorally, the regression period was the abnormal life event while fitness is their usual, habitual, life event. Comprehensively, they've already done that experimentation and understand what exercises work for their bodies. Some influencers choose to lie about how long it took for them to get results but that's another conversation. Many people strategically use regression. Bulking is a form if intentional regression. Many athletes will ""slow down"" for an off season to recover and to focus on technique. In other words, if you regress, embrace it. *Make it intentional*. Focus on technique or recovery. Going lighter in your workout doesn't mean you aren't working out. If you find yourself ""regressing"" often, it's possible you'd benefit from a change in your current routine. Take the time to try something new. 

**Weightless or muscle gains**. For now, I'll only say that a gym routine is a complimentary tool for these goals. Rather than getting stared at the gym, these topics require a more all encompassing lifestyle discussion about nutrition, hormones, genetics, fitness, and sleep. If loss or gain goals is what brought you to the gym, that's fine, but I strongly encourage creating a positive association before you start looking at gains and losses.

Everything I've written above is stuff I currently incorporate because I fell for it all. I didn't plan my schedule well, I had the wrong mindset which made the gym an uncomfortable place, I struggled to remain consistent because I wasn't 'in the mood.' Each time I started at the gym I felt either no obligation or high pressure obligation which, after inevitably missing a session, lead to prolonged off periods. I ignored celebrating the progress I had made because I was too focused on the fact that I was not achieving the unreasonable and unachievable goals I had created. I had many moments of feeling defeated before I gained an interest in learning more about overall wellness. 

I started listening to professionals and writing down ideas I wanted to incorporate into my life. I decided that weight loss should be a side-effect rather than a goal for me. I experimented and found exercises I enjoyed; that made me *feel* good. I made goals about improving flexibility, breaking a sweat and about elevating my heart rate every session. I started journaling--reflecting--about the progress I was seeing along with the professional advice I wanted to try next. I focused on form and repetitions which naturally lead to visible muscle development and increased flexibility. I discovered that I like the sauna rather than the steam room and talked to a gym trainer despite my gym introversion. Before I knew it, I'd achieved the longest gym streak of my life and learned more about fitness int he past few months than I did in the past years.  As a side effect, I've lost about 10lbs of fat and gained more muscle than I ever imagined I could put on. 

Getting in and staying in the gym can lead to great habits and health benefits. You will learn about yourself, maybe find a community, and discover something new! Maybe, like me, you'll begin looking up how to use various equipment, find some really helpful trainers who share free information, and learn about lifestyle wellness outside of the gym along the way.

Everything here is centered around controlling/reducing insulin, and elimination of insulin resistance.  Insulin dysfunction is at the center of most ailments nowadays, including obesity, diabetes, heart conditions, Alzheimer’s and even cancer.  The body produces insulin in response to the presence of glucose in the blood, so that’s the primary mechanism we’ll use below to control insulin.  For more information on this search for podcasts/articles by Jason Fung and Robert Lustig.



This routine has three components: diet, fasting, and exercise.  



**FASTING**

Fasting gives your body a break from processing macronutrients.  One the carb side, the reduction in glucose will give you long periods without insulin.  Insulin is a storage horomone used to store glucose into fat.  Your body cannot burn fat while insulin is high, so fasts allow your body to be able to pull energy from fat.



Additionally, fasting gives you a break from protein ingestion, which forces your body to recycle malformed cells/tissue internally, a process known as autophagy.



There are several types of fasts.  Many people refer to “intermittent fasting” with notation as 16:8, 18:6, 20:4.  The first number is how long you go without food, the second is your eating window.  Some people refer to these schemes as “time restricted eating” and will reserve the term “fasting” for extended fasts of 24 hours or more.



There’s also OMAD (one meal a day) which is basically a 23:1 fast.  And there’s ADF where you fast completely every other day, which looks a lot like 36:12.  And you can do one-off 24, 36, 48, or 72 hour fasts.



On a fast, you can consume water, carbonated water, black coffee, or green tea.  And that’s it.  For fasts longer than 24 hours you may feel cramping, heart palpitations, headaches, or faint.  This is a sign of low electrolytes.  You need to consume electrolytes during a long fast (every 12-18 hours).  I use LMNT brand.


You will feel hungry during these fasts, but hunger isn't pain.  You can often eliminate hunger by going for a walk, having some electrolytes, or having some carbonated water.  Or just wait a few hours and it'll fade.  


**My Scheme:** I did a modified ADF, fasting for 36 hours, 2-3 times a week.  Usually Friday, Sunday, and Wednesday, but sometimes that varied.  On non fasting days, I ate during a 12:12 window, usually from 7:30a to 7:30p.



I had to build up to this.  I started by doing a 16 hour fast just on Sundays, and 12:12 every other day.  Every Sunday, I added an hour to the fast until I was at a full 24 hours.  After 4 weeks of that, I jumped to my first 36 hour fast.  It was super hard.  The following week I did it again, and it was less hard, and continued to get easier.  After a couple months of a weekly 36 hour fast I started to add a second day (Wednesday), by first doing a 16 hour fast that day, then the next week doing an OMAD that day, then the next week making it a 36 hour fast.



I break the fast easy, with either an avocado, kimchi, or some kefir.  You’ll want to be near a toilet for a few hours your first few times.



**DIET**

I do a healthy keto diet.  I avoid sugar (including fruit), most starches (including bread, pasta, rice, and potatoes), seed oils (canola, safflower, sunflower, cottonseed, corn, peanut, soybean, “vegetable”), and ultra processed foods (all the chemicals).  I will eat some beans/lentils in moderation, infinite vegetables, and meat/egg/cheese.  You can put olive oil on things, but I don’t heat it up.  I cook with either tallow, ghee, coconut oil, or algae oil.



I don’t count calories ever.  I eat until I’m full.  I try not to snack and instead carbonate water helps me feel full if I want a snack.  My typical breakfast is steak and 4 eggs or a 6 egg omelette with cheese and bacon.  My typical lunch is a large salad with about a pound of salmon and no dressing, or pulled port on a pile of broccoli (no sugary sauces).  My usual dinner is a half a chicken (one breast, thigh, leg, and wing) with a bunch of sautéed veggies.  If I ever have a snack, it’s a piece of jerky or some cheese.



I will have a cheat meat every couple weeks or so: go out for pasta or have ice cream with my daughter.  This isn’t a cheat day, just a meal.  And I usually position it the day before a fast.



**EXERCISE**

Two types here: walking and weight training.



Walking, I do 4 miles 1-2 times a week with the dogs, usually on a weekend and almost always on a fasting day.  Additionally, go for a short 10 minute walk after dinner whenever you can.



For exercise, I do weight training 3-4 times a week. I never weight lift on a fasting day, but I will always workout fasted (e.g. before the 7:30am meal on an eating day).  I do the typical thing here: leg day, back/bi day, chest/tri day.  My workouts are usually 60 minutes with about 15 being warmups plus stretching after.



**NOTE ON ALCOHOL**

I quit drinking.  I don’t think there’s a way really make it work.  Theoretically your body can process up to a drink a day without causing harm, but that will occupy your liver from doing other work for your body.  Since I’ve started a year ago I’ve drank maybe 8 times, and when I do I’ve maxed out at 2 drinks.  Non-alcoholic beer tastes good nowadays and seems pretty socially acceptable.",2,1729391911.0,intermittentfasting,1,0.75,False

Wrapper: Nicaraguan Sun Grown (Jalapa)
Binder: Nicaraguan (Double Binder)
Filler: Nicaraguan
Size: 5 X 50 Robusto (Box-Pressed)
Strength: Medium/Full

My first ever Plasencia. He’s a soft boxed press with a beautiful oily sheen. Darker than my usual go to Connecticut with almost a copper penny coloring. First sniff gives me some sweetness followed by some spice. It smells like fall should. Triple cap is beautifully applied. V-cut is perfect. Cold draw gives off a ton of nuttiness and earthiness. Foot toasts amazingly even. The construction on this guy is SOLID. 

1/3 I get an incredibly full bodied tobacco experience (would probably be medium to most but I’m building up lol) Strong flavors of spice and coffee. This guy is creeeeeemy yum. Resting smell gives off an autumnal delight of earthiness like leaves and pumpkin spice. Burn line is straight as a pin. Zero ash dropage. He holds strong. 

2/3 starting to hit those sweeter notes. Vanilla is hitting the front with black pepper on the back. He remains incredibly creamy. I have zero fault to find in this flavor profile at all. Resting smell is still giving me autumn in all its glory. I’m enjoying the weight of this stick in my hand. Lost my ash about halfway into the second half of the third. Right on my damn shoe. Oh well lol I tried. 

3/3 sweeter notes are more nuanced now with some caramel and cocoa to go with the vanilla. More cinnamon spicy than black pepper now. Getting to that last bit and I don’t find myself overwhelmed with char yet. Consider me impressed as this is where I usually give in. I smoke this guy to the nub and completely enjoy every puff. 

Overall I’m highly impressed with my first Plasencia. I will absolutely be trying more of this line along with another Fuego. I quite honestly have no complaints at all. Zero nic fatigue (that was my worry going heavier). Paired well with my Dr Pepper. He left we wanting more. I rate this guy at a 9.5/10. ",2,1729391845.0,cigar_refuge,0,1.0,False

This HEB pulls 100,000 people monthly and is a bit more upper class... aka north side folks. It would have to be creative and convenient. If not creative then at least high in demand. I've thought of so much but problems occur with each idea, for example a coffee shop, there's a Starbucks and Dutch bros right next to it. There one in every corner now.

And I don’t need to go downtown for work nearly as much since 2019.

In general, I’ve enjoyed the west suburbs more than the north, although I do miss the easier access to the North Side that north burbs offer. We’re thinking maybe Elmhurst, Wheaton, or Glen Ellyn.

Pros and cons we should consider? Any other areas we should add to the consideration mix?

Berwyn has had its advantages, but we haven’t loved it. Part the city, part the limitations of a bungalow. Would be great to live in a burb with a downtown that’s fun to hang out in (coffee shops, ethnic restaurants, etc). And we don’t want to be so close to O’Hare that noise is an issue. 

No kids, but we want an area with decent schools so re-selling isn’t as much of a challenge.",1,1729391404.0,NearWestSuburbs,0,1.0,False

For the past few months I've gotten on well with my housemates and I'd even consider myself friends with Housemate A; we talk about TV shows and sometimes sit in the communal room for hours and I've leant them fridge space, let them in the front door whenever they forget their keys, have gotten their packages, cooked food and shared it with them, leant perfume, given the left overs of my perfume (I bought a new one before it ran out), gave one of my teddies and leant any items. Housemate A has also leant me their cooking items and cooked food for me and leant me a few household items such as washing up items.

My and housemate A talk about a LOT of things in depth, sex included. I've been very open about my sex life; I was only with one person for 6 years until recently and started testing the waters with other people. I moved into this house when I started testing said waters.
I am interested in kink and we've talked a bit about it and they've always been very receptive and conversed back with me. It never felt like an unwanted conversation and they talked about their sex life too.

I also do OF. They bought it up once and I said I'd try it one day and they said the same thing and even showed me tiktoks of an OF tiktok creator we both knew and laughed at some of the memes. I started doing OF and when I spoke about it they changed their tune and were like ""I don't think I could do it"" was like oh, okay, that's fair enough.

Now, over the past 7 months I've been here, I've slept with 3 people. I've had 5 people over and the amount of visits I had was about 10 in total. 
I asked once if it was okay to have one of those people over and Housemate A and B said yes and A had told me I don't need to ask and that no one follows the contract anyway. I was like coolio and actually forgot asking was even a thing I was supposed to do tbh. 

I recently had someone over, I spoke to A about it and we talked about some of the stuff this person wanted me to do. Very painful stuff to himself, inflicted by me; crotch standing, some wax and a riding crop- oh and a spiky pinwheel. Actually not what I'm into at all but I know the person very well and thought it'd be a change of pace- its nothing I've ever done before, the most I've had are like slaps to my face and been choked and I really wanted to step outside my comfort zone. I spoke in depth to A about this and they never said anything just laughed at some of the stuff and what not and we talked normally. They said they couldn't do thst unless they were getting paid for it.

The next morning after my friend came over I'm very ashamed to admit I felt a little embarrassed that I told A in such detail about the stuff and to rectify it, I thought it would be a good idea if I lied. I said I got paid to do it because I felt like the judgement would be less. I'm fucking stupid. 
A few hours later I get a message from housemate A. It's basically saying (in short):

 ""You are in the house everyday but B and I are out at work. You leave mess everywhere, there are always boxes everywhere constantly filling up the bins and the sides are always filthy, because of your stuff always being in the sink we cant clean our stuff. You keep brining guys over. Thanks to you, I don't feel like I can bring my kids around because you always have people over (Housemate A doesn't live with their kids- also don't slate them for as what happened was completely out of their hands.) You always have people over and we don't get asked if it's okay.  I have spoken to B and if this mess isn't cleaned up by (1 hour before I saw the note) and if you have another person over tonight, Housemate B is going to flip. I will take pictures of the mess.""
I was and still am genuinely baffled and was really anxious and kinda angry and upset. Above, I explained how many guys I've slept with. Not that many to be honest and it only makes 4 in my lifetime... not that it matters anyway???

The thing is, the bins get very full quickly, we have 1 bin between 3 housemates and sometimes when any of us order stuff, it fills quicker. I started keeping boxes in my room because I felt bad for taking up so much bin space and even bought a bin compresser. I've definitely left mess, I wont say I haven't- I have ADHD and sometimes I don't always clean and stay organised. Whenever there was a mess, I apologised and Housemate A would always say it's okay, they've got mess too. When people come over I spring clean my room and sometimes (I want to say 3 times?) I put my stuff in the sink and don't clean it cause I'm rushing.

For the past few months I've bought about 4 bottles of washing up liquid and 3 packs of sponges. I've bought black bins 3 times and some small ones once. I've bought a toilet scrub, a toilet scent thing, spray for the toilet, washing up dish cloths and lots of toilet paper. One time I'd gone out for 2 days and left an entire new loo roll in the bathroom and I came back and it was half gone.

Recently the other housemates don't take the bins out. In the first month I did slack taking the bins out because I couldn't always remember what one was put out and I apologised if I forgot. I've taken them out for about 3 months now. I'd forgot (often) our bins get FULL and there's lots of bags of stuff. This is the only sort of thing I felt like maybe that had a bit of conflict, I felt like they were always expecting me to take them out because they both work full time jobs away from home and I work part time and I'm in the house. They'd never said anything but it had been hinted (I can't remember now but I remember thinking, does that mean they want me to always do it because theyre not in?) So whenever I forgot I always apologised as if it was duty. The one time B took out the bins and asked me to bring the back in, I forgot to bring them back in so I cleaned the kitchen and bathroom as an apology. Infact, I cleaned so hard the algae and mould that was in the shower seal was GONE. I fucking shoved a wire up that shit and cleaned it like it was my last day on earth.

Also sometimes I've left my own mess in the sink, I've cleaned up everyone else's too as an apology. I think I've done this twice out of about the 3 or so times I've left stuff in the sink (a guess cause I don't remember exactly.) There's been black mould in the washing machine and on the sides of the sink seal and I've obliterated the shit out of that too.

I explained how I felt in my message and sent it and I felt a bit slighed by all this so I took all my stuff. I cleaned up my mess- 3 bowls, 2 plates and a mug, I put my rice cooker bowl away and a takeaway bag I'd been using as a bin because the bins were outside (I usually put these bags in my own room if the bins are full but I just can't always stand the smell on my own room and A left a load of curry out for a week so it STUNK everytime I went to the bathroom so I thpight it woild be okay, mine was left out for 2 MAYBE 3 days). The irony there is the sink has a lot of things in that aren't mine and there was stuff on the side thst all belongs to A, also the washing machine is full of moully items- like WHITE, coated, mould. The scheduled cleaners took a good 70% of the stuff out of it a week or 2 ago and cleaned it (using all my washing up liquid or they stole it idk) and there are still mouldy items in that washing machine. A also leaves a lot of meat out, Ive turned the oven on twice to preheat and once found a whole fucking chicken in there- and it stayed in there for a food few days and Ive found other meat in there too or on the side (Im genuinly impressed by their stomach and the fact they dont have food posioning EVER) and they've left mouldy veg. Ive left dirty items in the sink and it was full but ive never let them go mouldly.. infact when A leaves coffee on the side I've poured their mould out. Maybe I'm being really petty when I say this but when I cleaned up my stuff, it barely made a difference but after writing my response according to the letter I had like 30 minutes left of time before B came back and A took pictures of all the mess and blamed it on me. 

I can't lie, I was petty. I took my amazon firestick, my bathroom mat, my soap, my sponges, my washing up towels, 120 rolls of toilet paper ( I got off tiktok for like £20 dont ask) that I said everyone could use, I took my cleaning supplies, my gloves, scissors, spray etc. I have no room in this box room for all this btw. They all have under the bed storage and for some reason, I dont.
When I came out the bathroom housemate B was back and I'd remembered B had made a comment to me the day before when I had someone over. B called me and said they had work in the morning and I was like.. okay? And B said it was early so too be quiet. I felt confused because I felt like I've always been quiet (I CONSTANTLY asked if I was too loud because I can hear housemate B and their partner being piped almost everytime and I was embarrassed to think they could hear me) but I let it go and messaged Housemate A about it AND spoke to them in person and they said ""I had no idea, I just told B that you ""have another partner over again"". I wasn't sure if was detecting some passive aggressiveness with the ""again""- I'm neurodivergent, a sensitive little bitch and absolute balls at reading people sometimes but I just moved on.

Now keep in mind B has always been very nice; charming and jokey and seeing housemate B after this message A had left me, I asked B; ""Did I make too much noise when I had someone over last?"" They said no and I asked why they said it and B said ""I knew why."" 
I said I genuinely don't know why and asked for an explanation. 

Now I cant remember the exact order of this conversation because I was really hot-headed because of some of the stuff that was said so I might be telling this like BACE kinda pipeline instead of ABCD.
I got told that it was because of ""all the people you've been bringing over"". I said I don't get the issue and they said I didn't ask them if they were okay with it. I said well they don't ask when they bring their partner over (theyre sometimes here when Housemate B isn't here btw which is v against the rules, Ive never left anyone here when I'm out bc I don't agree with that) and they said they don't need to because they asked once, they don't have to do it everytime. I was like hmm doesnt sound like the tenancy agreement and they told me to check it (I did, it doesn't really state whether or not you do need to ask everytime with the same person but it does say you need to ask your housemates when you bring someone over so I feel like we ALL fall under breaking that not just me but maybe Im reaching??)
 They said they don't trust the people I bring over. I was like huh? Where tf is this coming from? They were like ""Oh you know why. Face it, >my name here< you're a prositute."" I was like ?????? And then it clicked. I was like oh the ball thing and they looked at me like I'd fucking murdered someone and it actually really hurt. I wasn't about to say I lied about being paid, I'd look like a fucking weirdo but I didn't want the hassle of seeming like I was back tracking and also, I support sex anyway so I really didn't see the issue with keeping the gag up. I was like ""So? The person I had over wanted their crotch stood on, I don't get how it affects you, I did it in my room and I didnt fuck him for money either."" B said I dont know these people I bring over and it's jeprodizing their partner and Housemate A is scared and cant bring their kids over. I was really baffled where this was coming from. I might be an idiot and can't read social situations but when I said they'd paid me, Housemate A said ""bring them back, I wanna do it if I get paid!"" And said it very enthusiastically. 

It went back forth and I got told ""you bring in a new person every time I walk through the door."" Keep in mind. 10 visits, 7 months, 5 guys, sexually involved with 3 of them. I said that too and said well you have your partner over for all the days you're here (about 3-4 days a week) and sometimes theyre even here when you're not. And they were like ""The difference is, I only bring 1 person."". I don't know if I'm taking this too personally but I feel like I'm being shamed a little. I'm 27, I'm trying to have an active sex life and explore because I've been in 1 relationship for 6 bloody years.
I got called disgusting, got looked up and down like I was trash, I got told I sleep with everyone for money (how did stepping on a crotch turn into I sleep with everyone for money? I feel like A and B have talked about my (solo) OF and B has just decided I now sleep with everyone I invite over specifically for money. I got told ""this isn't a doss house"" and some just some really nasty stuff.

I was yelling btw I was not innocent in this, I was really fucking bad and stuck between angry yelling and crying. I didn't namecall B like they did but I said imagine how it felt getting a letter saying you were going to flip your lid, that's not really something I feel amazing hearing. (I come from an abusive childhood which B doesn't know but A does and although I can control the situation in kink, hearing I having an angry housemate just put me on edge. Once again, B doesn't know, I'm just giving context to why I said this). B was like no, I didnt say that actually I said I was going to call the police. Now okay, ngl this pissed me off. I'm half African carribean and something about the police just fucking triggered the shIIIT out of me. I genuinely don't know if my reaction was like uncalled for but when my dad's been pulled over for scratching his ear because they thought he was on the phone, I panic thinking about how police can look at me and make snap decisions. I can't really remember what I said. In general, I didn't insult B, I just pointed out what they did wrong in the house and how I felt and explained myself but I did shout and cry a lot. 

I finished there and said some petty things about they need to buy their own bags and soap and stuff. Oh fuck I forgot, I also told him to stop innaprorioately touching housemate A because A told me that B picks them up and they don't like it, has expressed it multiple times and has even been touched on the butt whole being picked up. I said to A you need to talk to B but unfortunately A never got the chance to because I yelled it at B. I felt bad  that I flipped and did that because it wasn't my place to say, that was something A was supposed to say. A told me in confidence, I'd broke that and I messaged A my thoughts on the whole situation, explained what happened with B and what they said, asked nicely for my perfume, Teddy and tweezers back and explained I don't feel comfortable really conversing with anyone in the house and then explained I'd flipped at B and told them about the whole inappropriate touching thing and apologised profusely for that. I also apologised for bringing that guy over but I did say, keep in mind, he's DBS checked because he looks after someone for his full time job and it's never been my intention to make A feel like they were in harm or make A feel like they can't bring ther kids over (also A had told me months back they didn't let their kids come over because they felt it wasn't fair on their housemates so I just took that at face value so being told that was a slap in the face.)

I feel baffled by this. Ive been here for nearly 7 months. I thought I had a friendship with A and I thought if they were uncomfortable with anything they'd tell me but they didn't. Instead they talked about it with B until it blew up in my face. I asked B why did you leave it for so long if ypy had a problem and they 'Oh, I dont want to be rhwt person whi has to knock on your door and tell you"" (or something like that) Do I genuinely deserve this? I feel like I don't and I'm trying to look at it from all angles but I feel like this is way too harsh. Please, can I get some insight? I feel disgusting and really uncomfortable living in this house now. I'm desperate to move out and I'm making plans to save 6 months rent for a new place. ",1,1729391293.0,badroommates,1,1.0,False

1) He would melt down/become destructive in the morning when we changed his clothes for school.  He bit an aide on the bus last week and we were getting to the point where the bus wouldn’t be an option anymore

2) He would melt down coming home from ABA every afternoon.  We would eat dinner within 20 mins but by then he was hard to soothe and get a full meal in him.

We made 2 minor changes.  

1) He doesn’t like jeans so he’s mostly in sweat pants.  We just stared having him wear his clothes for the next day to bed… and just keep him in those clothes in the morning - no need to battle in the morning and he didn’t seem to care much as night…

2) I have a plate of snacks waiting for him on the coffee table when he gets home.  A protein, fruit and something new/not preferred.  He doesn’t really eat dinner with us anymore… but zero issues in the evening now.

We made these changes last week and zero serious meltdowns…. It’s crazy.

1g7olvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1g7olvl/fiction_the_unseen_realms/,[Fiction] The Unseen Realms,"As dawn broke, the sun peeked over the horizon, bathing the tranquil streets in a soft, golden light. I found myself drawn to The Cardboard Kingdom, the local game shop, a sanctuary that had become almost like a second home to me. The familiar chime of the doorbell welcomed me as I entered, the scent of freshly brewed coffee mingling with the faint mustiness of cardboard and ink. The walls were lined with shelves packed with boxes of every imaginable game, from the classics to the latest releases. The Unseen Realms held a place of honor, its artwork vibrant and inviting.

Regulars nodded in acknowledgment as I navigated past their tables. I claimed my usual spot by the window, where the light was just right. The shop owner, a kindly man with an encyclopedic knowledge of games, flashed a knowing smile. ""Setting up the usual?"" he inquired, to which I responded with a nod.

I docked my Caster, a sleek compact device that stores my entire collection of cards, into the table. In no time, my cards were displayed on the screen built into the table. I began to strategize, sifting through my cards to optimize my deck.

As I continued to arrange my deck, Jerry, another regular, approached the table with his characteristic confidence.

""Ready to lose today, UnseenAaron?"" he taunted, using my screen name.

""In your dreams, JerryTheBold,"" I retorted, using his screen name.

Jerry docked his Caster into the table with a satisfying click, just as my best friend Sophie Unseen Realms entered the store. She greeted me and positioned herself to watch the impending showdown. The game was a roller coaster, with the advantage constantly shifting between us. A crowd gathered, engrossed in the intense match. I couldn't help but exclaim in triumph, ""YES! Two down, one more to go!"" eliciting a mix of applause and groans from the spectators.

The Caster, doing its other job, randomly chose The Forgotten Forest as the random location for our next match. I picked my creature, equipment, and spells I would be using for the encounter, then I placed my Caster back into the slot on the table.

""Deck locked in."" The device said as it displayed my character Udreforn, a humanoid rabbit warrior called a Lapine, on the screen.

Jerry's Caster said the same thing as it slid into the dock and then displayed a Liontari, a cat-like humanoid, called Captain Lack Care-o.

I stated my attack. ""Udreforn attacks Captain Lack Care-o at The Forgotten Forest on Dásos.""

My cards flowed onto the display built into the table. It was going to be a little rough at first but I thought I could make it work. The Hexagon tile map of the forest appeared on the table's display. I selected and revealed my first card.

""I move 3.""

""I move 4,"" Jerry said with a smirk.

I smiled as I revealed my next card, ""Energy Beam, your creature takes 3 damage."" The crowd nodded in approval of my swift attack.

Jerry, however, was not to be outdone. He revealed his card, ""Tidal Shield, I gain 15 temporary hit points until the end of the turn."" I smirked, revealing my final card, ""Aetheric Sprint, I move 10 spaces away."" I moved Udreforn out of what I assumed to be Jerry's range.

Jerry smiled, revealing his last card, ""Whirlwind Slash."" I smirked, confident I was out of his attack's range. But Jerry's smile broadened, ""I activate my equipment, Galeforce Revolver. Wind attacks range and damage are increased by 10. You take 15 damage.""

I had to admit, it was a solid move. ""That was pretty impressive, Jerry. Not gonna lie."" We drew back up to 5 cards, ready for the next round. The game was far from over, and despite the challenges, I was confident in my strategy. After all, in this game, it wasn't just about the cards you held, but how you played them.

I examined the cards in my hand. Most cards in The Unseen Realms had two halves to them. One half would be an attack, and the other half would be a movement or defense ability. When revealing the card you have to choose one half of the card to use. Some cards were special, they don't have two halves. These cards are called Commitment cards. They are extra powerful but leave you with no choice on what to use when it is revealed. Which means they can be used without actually having an impact on the game.

I selected 3 cards from my hand for this round.

I cast Sorcery of Spatial Shift, I teleport to here. I moved my character in close range of Captain Lack Care-o. Then I revealed my first card for this round, ""Inferno Pulse, you take 25 damage."" Inferno Pulse was a powerful Commitment card it required that the character use Aether and Fire elements and was discarded after use.

Now with Udreforn at 50HP and Captain Lack Care-o at 42HP Jerry revealed his next card, ""Walked right into this one. Pyroclasm, you take 7 damage.""

I winced flipping my next card, ""Shockwave, you take 3 damage and are pushed back 3 spaces."" The screen updated the Captain's position on the screen.

Jerry's smile widened as he pressed his advantage. ""Thunder Strike, I move 4 and deal 5. Plus the bonus from the Galeforce Revolver makes it 19.""

""This isn't good."" I said flipping my last card for this round. ""I move 5."" I started to navigate Udreforn away from the Captain when Jerry spoke up. ""Curse of Amplify Gravity. Your movements are reduced by 5.""

My eyes scrambled to come up with a plan then I remembered my other spell, granted to me by Udreforn's Ability. ""Enchantment of Whimsical Lightness, My movements are increased by 10."" I moved my 10 spaces away hoping I was out of range. Jerry's smile just got bigger and bigger with each square.

He flipped his last card, ""Tsunami, you take another 15 damage."" His smile broadened more as he looked at Udreforn's HP of 20. ""I've got you now, Aaron.""

I drew 3 cards again, hope blooming in my chest as I saw just the cards I needed to maybe, just maybe, win this match. ""Well Jerry this has been a fun match but I think I got this in the bag."" I said trying to bluff Jerry. ""you would have to hit me pretty hard this round to win."" I continued trying not to totally give away my plan.

I selected my 3 cards, watching Jerry think hard on how to pick his cards, then I revealed my first commitment card. ""Vortex of the Void. You take 15 damage and an additional 5 Damage per turn as long as you end the turn in the zone. Also, all creatures in the affected zones movement is reduced by 3.""

Jerry's face paled as he took in the effects of my trump card. He reluctantly flipped his card realizing too late his mistake. He revealed his first card, ""Ice Lance, You take 5 damage, and I take 5 for ending the turn inside the zone.""

I revealed the next card, sweating slightly ""Ethereal Flame you take 3 damage and an additional 2 damage at the end of each turn until the end of the round.""

He flipped his next card. ""Gust dash, I move 6 spaces-"" He started before I cut him off. ""Your movement is reduced by 3.""

He grit his teeth, ""I move 3 spaces, and take 7 damage.""

I sighed in relief as I took note of his HP of 9 as I made my final play. ""Blazing Inferno you take 18 damage, which means I -"" he cut me off. ""Strike Shield, I gain 10 temporary hit points. I survive with 1 Hit Point left."" He smiled Shakily. ""Now to end this this Aaron,"" he flipped his last card. ""Celestial Tempest, you take 30 damage. How does it feel UnseenAaron. Victory snatched from you at the last-""

He stopped short, noticing my grin. ""Mirror Mantle, all damage that would be dealt to me is instead reflected back at you."" Jerry's shoulders slumped in defeat, as the crowd of people cheered at the last minute back and forth struggle.

""That was an awesome game, Jerry! You almost had me at the end there,"" I said, extending a hand for a handshake. Jerry grumbled as he shook my hand. ""Yeah, almost, but you always manage to find a way to turn the tables.""

I shrugged. ""Luck of the draw, I guess, but you did pretty well, too. You had a few unexpected tricks up your sleeve.""

My best friend, Sophie, sprinted up to me fresh cup of coffee in hand. ""Dude, that was awesome!"" she squealed giving me a hug.

""I know right!"" I replied reaching toward the table to grab my Caster.

I stopped, my hand inches away when I noticed the display on the table.

It was a trade window. In the window was a single card that I had never seen before called, Soul Link. The card glimmered in the light, inviting me to trade for it.

""Where did this come from?"" I asked, looking around at Sophie and Jerry.

Sophie shrugged. ""I didn't put it there. Maybe someone left it for you as a gift?""

I looked for the player ID of the person who started the trade and was shocked to find that it was blank.

I hesitated, unsure of what to do. I had never heard of this card, and the player ID being blank was just weird. ""Should I accept it?"" I asked Sophie.

""I don't know, Aaron, that could be a bad idea. What if someone is trying to hack your Caster?"" she said as she exchanged worried glances with Jerry. But I was determined. I had to know what this card was.

Finally, I made up my mind. ""I'm going to accept the trade.""

As I clicked the accept button, a strange sensation washed over me. The edges of my vision began to blur, and a tingling feeling spread from my fingertips up my arms.

""Aaron? Are you okay?"" Sophie's voice sounded distant, as if coming from the end of a long tunnel.

I tried to respond, but my mouth wouldn't move. The world around me began to ripple and distort, colors swirling together like paint on a canvas. The familiar sights and sounds of The Cardboard Kingdom faded away, replaced by a kaleidoscope of shifting light and shadow.

For a moment, I felt weightless, suspended in a void between realities. Then, with a sudden rush, the world snapped back into focus. But it wasn't the world I knew.

I found myself standing in the middle of a lush, vibrant forest. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and exotic flowers. Towering trees with gnarled trunks and sprawling canopies surrounded me, their leaves shimmering with an otherworldly iridescence.

It clicked suddenly where I was as I recognized the patch of trees from The Forgotten Forest card's art.

As I tried to process this impossible change, the forest around me seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy. Shadows danced between the trees, and I could've sworn I heard whispers on the wind.

""Welcome to The Unseen Realms, my friend."" The voice came from everywhere and nowhere at once.

I spun around, trying to locate its source. ""Who's there? Show yourself!""

A chuckle resonated through the air, and the very fabric of reality seemed to ripple. From the distortion, a figure emerged – tall, robed, and wearing a mask that seemed to shift and change the longer I looked at it.

""I am The Collector,"" the figure said, its voice carrying an air of ancient wisdom and barely contained power. ""Master of The Unseen Realms and keeper of its secrets.""

I took an involuntary step back. ""What... what is this place? What do you want with me?""

The Collector tilted its head, the mask's expression morphing into something between amusement and intrigue. ""This, my young friend, is The Forgotten Forest. As for what I want..."" It spread its arms wide, encompassing the surreal forest around us. ""I want you to play the game, of course. To explore, to learn, to grow. In The Unseen Realms, anything is possible – if you're brave enough to seize it.""

With a wave of its hand, the forest began to dissolve around us, replaced by swirling colors and abstract shapes. ""Your journey begins now, UnseenAaron. Make it a good one.""

Before I could respond, the world shifted again, and I found myself standing in what felt like the world's largest mall...

Instead of regular stores and shops, the entire space was dedicated to The Unseen Realms. There were hundreds of people around, laughing and cheering as they played games.

The space was massive, spanning several floors, lined with booths and stalls showcasing various card sets, accessories, and merchandise. Brightly colored banners and signs hung from the ceiling, advertising the latest releases and special promotions.

The floors were made of gleaming marble, and the walls were adorned with murals and artwork depicting various characters and scenes from the game. At the center of the space, a massive arena-like area was set up, complete with seating for hundreds of spectators and huge holograms that showed the action unfolding in real time.

As I made my way through the crowd, I saw players huddled around tables, strategizing and examining their cards with intense concentration. In one corner, a group of beginners was being coached by an experienced player, while in another, a group of seasoned veterans was locked in a heated battle.

I glanced at my hand, where my Caster was now emitting a soft blue glow that was now fading away, and looked up to see a girl with long black hair, wearing what appeared to be a pilot's flight jacket, walking up to me.

""Hi, my name is Katlyn. I was instructed to show you around Mentis and bring you to your first match.""

'Oh, I have a match to get to, apparently,' I thought to myself.

As Katlyn guided me through Mentis, I felt overwhelmed by the sheer scale and vibrancy of the place. We paused at a railing overlooking the central arena, where holographic creatures clashed in epic battles.

""This is incredible,"" I breathed, watching a fiery phoenix dive-bomb a towering ice giant. ""How is this even possible?""

Katlyn smiled. ""The Unseen Realms taps into something beyond our understanding of reality. It's not just a game – it's a bridge between worlds.""

We continued our tour, passing by bustling card shops where players haggled over rare finds, and strategy centers where veterans offered advice to wide-eyed newcomers. At one point, we stopped to watch a street performer conjuring illusions of famous battles from the game's lore.

""How do you not get lost in all this?"" I asked, gesturing at the labyrinthine layout of Mentis.

Katlyn laughed. ""Oh, trust me, I did at first. But you learn to navigate it, just like you learn to navigate the game itself. Speaking of which, are you ready for your first match?""

I hesitated, suddenly aware of how little I truly understood about this new reality. ""I... I'm not sure. What if I mess up?""

Katlyn placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder. ""Everyone starts somewhere, Aaron. The beauty of The Unseen Realms is that it grows with you. Now, let's find your arena.""

""This is astounding,"" I exclaimed, my eyes widening with awe. ""I never imagined something like this existed.""

""Oh, it gets even better,"" she said as she walked over to a simple-looking door with the words 'Deck 23' printed over it.

""Your first match is just a simple 1v1 so you can get an idea of how the system works.""

As I stood before the door marked 'Deck 23', my heart raced. Katlyn gave me an encouraging smile.

""You've got this, Aaron. Just remember, in The Unseen Realms, your instincts are just as important as your strategy.""

I nodded, trying to swallow the lump in my throat. ""Any last-minute advice?""

Katlyn thought for a moment. ""Trust your cards. They're more than just game pieces here they're... like extensions of yourself.""

The door swung open. With a deep breath, I stepped inside.

""Oh and try not to freak out to much about the transfo-"" she was cut off as the door swung closed and I couldn't hear her anymore.

""The what?"" I muttered confused.

I closed my eyes, centering myself. 'You can do this, Aaron,' I thought. 'It's just like back at The Cardboard Kingdom. Just... completely different.'

I clutched my Caster tightly in my hands and looked around; the entire room was dark except for two glowing disks on the floor. One spot was already taken by a guy with short black hair, so I walked over to the other disk.
I stepped onto the glowing disk, heart pounding. ""Uh, hey there. I'm Aaron. Is this your first time too?""

The guy on the other disk chuckled. ""Nah, I've been around the block a few times. Name's Post. You look a little lost.""

I rubbed the back of my neck, embarrassed. ""That obvious, huh? I was kinda expecting a table or something.""

Post's eyes gleamed with amusement. ""Oh, trust me, it's way better than a table. Just wait for it...""

As if on cue, a sleek pole rose from the floor in front of me. I jumped back, startled.

""Whoa! Okay, definitely not a table.""

Post laughed. ""Welcome to Mentis, newbie. Hope you're ready for a wild ride.""

A voice from a holographic display in the center of the room called out, ""Welcome, UnseenAaron, to Mentis. Please dock your Caster on the Podium."" I did as the voice commanded and placed my Caster onto the familiar-looking dock. The voice continued, ""Post Malarkey, please dock your Caster. This is a one versus one match, please lock in your decks.""

My deck suddenly appeared in front of me on a holographic display just like the one from the card shop.

I peeked around and could see that my opponent was putting together his battle set, so I figured I should do the same.

As I cycled through my cards, I couldn't help but mutter to myself. ""Okay, Zara's a solid choice. Good health, high constitution...""

""Talking to yourself already? That's usually a sign of impending defeat,"" my opponent called out with a smirk.

I looked up, my ears burning. ""Oh, uh, just thinking out loud.""

He nodded. ""Word of advice, newbie? Don't telegraph your strategy. These walls have ears – sometimes literally.""

I felt my cheeks flushed. ""Right, thanks.""

Keeping my mouth shut I selected Zara trying to keep my strategy simple. Then I gave her Aquaform to expand on her earth attacks by giving her access to water attacks. And I'll include Locations like Glacier Pass, Thundering Falls, and the Tangled Coast so that she can heal with her attacks.

And with my creatures and locations sorted, I locked in my deck.

""UnseenAaron, since this is your first battle, you may go first. Please reveal the first location.""

I tapped on the location deck and the holographic display in the middle of the room flashed as it randomly shifted to show what location it was: Glacier Pass.

""Yes!"" I said, cheering.

Finally, my opponent's creature was revealed as Nocturna, a bat-like creature from a race called Akver.

""Please declare your attacking creature, UnseenAaron,"" came the voice from the display.

""Zara attacks Nocturna at Glacier Pass,"" I said, tapping the creature.

I waited for my cards to appear on the hologram, but to my surprise, it vanished. Post tapped his defending creature, a smirk playing on his face. Suddenly, a rush of energy surged through my body, unlike anything I'd ever felt before.

Bright, swirling lights enveloped me, creating a dazzling cocoon. A tingling sensation started at my feet, slowly creeping up my body. It was as if every cell in my being was awakening, transforming. I felt myself growing taller, stronger, my very essence changing at its core.

My bones creaked and shifted, muscles stretching and reforming. I looked down at my hands, mesmerized as the light passed over my fingers. They elongated, thickened, my nails extending and sharpening into deadly claws. My skin darkened and thickened, a fine layer of fur sprouting and spreading like wildfire across my body.

My face contorted, my jaw elongating, teeth sharpening into fearsome fangs. My ears grew pointed, swiveling atop my head with newfound mobility. A tail sprouted from my lower back, long and powerful.

As the physical changes slowed, I became aware of a whole new world of sensations. Scents I'd never noticed before assaulted my nose - the crisp, cold air, the faint musk of my opponent, even the lingering aroma of the cards we'd just been holding. Sounds that should have been imperceptible reached my ears - the subtle hum of energy in the room, the rapid heartbeat of Post across from me.

Overwhelmed by the flood of new sensations and the shocking physical changes, I couldn't contain myself. ""AAAHHHHHHHH!"" I roared, my voice deeper and more guttural than I'd ever heard it. ""WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON!""

A high-pitched squeak of laughter answered me. ""BAHAHA!""

I whipped my head around, my new senses instantly locking onto the source. Where Post had stood moments ago, there was now a creature straight out of a fantasy bestiary. Nocturna, in all her bat-like glory, hung upside down from the ceiling, wings folded around her body, eyes gleaming with mischief.

Before I could process this new shock, a blinding light filled the room. The temperature plummeted, and I felt my fur standing on end in response to the sudden cold. As my eyes adjusted, I found myself standing between two massive walls of ice, their surfaces gleaming like polished mirrors. Nocturna was nowhere to be seen, likely hidden in some shadowy crevice.

The realization hit me like a thunderbolt. If Post had become Nocturna, then I must have transformed into Zara. I looked down at my hands - no, my claws - flexing them experimentally. They were massive, powerful, capable of rending stone and ice alike.

I caught my reflection in one of the ice walls and gasped. Staring back at me was a creature of myth and legend. Zara's feline features were unmistakable - the sleek fur, the pointed ears, the gleaming eyes. But there was something else there too, something uniquely... me.",2,1729390349.0,story,0,1.0,False

Sony wants something as big or bigger than No Way Home, Marvel Studios wants a street level movie. They also want to keep Zendaya in some way.

Peter Parker has become the friendly neighborhood Spiderman. His acts, while small, keep New York safe from any immediate danger. He occasionally runs into the big villains like scorpion, but he’s doing well in school and attending NYU. But he’s very lonely. Nobody he loved remembers him.

During the summer he bumps into MJ and orders another coffee from the shop she works at, and she goes over because she thinks Peter knows way too much about her.

One day, Peter accepts a position as an intern to work at a Bio informatics lab that is attempting to create a camouflage from Skrulls to use on humans. In the meeting Peter meets Harry Osborn. Peter is hesitant to befriend him, however, Harry tells Peter that his father died in the battle of New York. Harry, with his wealth has also bought Avengers tower in NYC.

Peter then gets in contact with the venom symbiote and it gives him new found strength, confidence and happiness. He asks MJ on a date and she says yes. He and Harry have become friends. His life is somehow going back to a new form of normalcy.

 Then, a portal appears. It’s Oscar Issac as Spiderman 2099! He brings along Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. Then Oscar Issac leaves saying he has other things to attend to.

THEY ATTACK TOM HOLLAND.

they have been sent to obtain the symbiote from Peter because not only is it dangerous, but it doesn’t belong to his universe, and Peter doesn’t like it.

Now Peter, Harry, MJ and Ned must come together to fight off the Spiderman attempting to kill Peter Parker. 

However, the twist is that Peter knows that the other two Spiderman aren’t after him, but they are after the symbiote. Harry also has other motivations like getting the multiversal traveling device from them.

Harry takes the serum he has created and has turned into a giant Goblin creature. With wings too.

The three spider men unite and defeat Harry, the two spider men decide to let Tom Holland be as the symbiote is harmless, and that version of venom was an anti hero.

I have three roommates, and I share a bedroom with one of them. We also share a bathroom. She is an exchange student from Germany. There are many cultural differences between all of us, and that only makes bringing this up even more difficult. I don't want to stereotype europeans, but our ideas of cleanliness are...different. 

Multiple times a day, she goes to the bathroom and after a little bit she flushes, after that the bathtub starts. I can hear her cupping the water in her hands and splashing it against something. I started paying close attention to this because when I clean the tub there is some ""evidence"" that she might be using our bath as a bidet. Does anyone know of people doing this? Or at least thats what I think it is, just some specks. My towels are yellow and hers are purple so it definitely is not from that. 

I genuinely have no idea how to bring this up. How on earth do I tell my german roommate, who I am not close with, that I have been paying very close attention to her bathroom habits and formed a hypothesis.

Another thing is that she uses all of my things in the kitchen since she does not have her own (pots, pans, forks, spoons, plates, bowls, tupper-ware, coffee pot and mugs, etc), and shows very little care when handling raw meat and fish. Doesn't wash her hands or disinfect the areas that the meat touched, I saw her rinse my wooden cutting board with water after cutting chicken on it.

1g7oakw,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaturatedFat/comments/1g7oakw/curious_about_unintentionally_lowcalorie_swampy/,Curious about unintentionally low-calorie swampy eating experiences?,"Background: I've made some great health progress since quitting pufa 7-8 months ago (not 100% perfect but I try my best - I never eat food fried in seed/olive/avocado oil but may have some bread or a prepackaged snack with a small amount. I more recently stopped lying to myself that Popeyes fries in full beef fat 😅 their chicken sandwiches were never a regular occurrence though). My digestion is much better, and pmdd-triggered binge eating behaviors have naturally faded away. I've lost about 10-12 lbs as well (135 - ~122 as a 5'2""/f). The first 10 lb loss was through several rounds of fat fasting which worked great, then I gave that up because I started an exercise program that doesn't really mesh well with fasting. My weight has stayed mostly stable the last few months, perhaps slowly trending downwards (hard to tell with cycle-related fluctuations), but body composition has definitely changed since then due to the workout program - I've lost more inches. 

My current eating routine is coffee with cream and sometimes agave in the morning, then I eat my first real meal sometime after noon, often around 2pm-4pm unless I notice I'm hungry earlier. I eat whatever sounds good (minus pufa). I don't count calories but I do try to tune into my hunger cues, and this is much easier to do after several months avoiding pufa. I feel like I usually eat to satisfaction but not stuffed (going no pufa also reduced the urge to make myself super full). I may just have the one meal, but will add a snack, dessert, or another meal if I'm hungry again later. 

Now to my query: I sometimes add up the calories after I've eaten, just to compare how much I've consumed vs how hungry/full I am. The daily total is often 1500 or less (sometimes a lot less). I'm not doing anything to change this as this is the most balanced I've felt with food/eating habits. I'm mostly observing to see if things naturally shift over time, on their own. There are a lot changes and healing happening with my body, so maybe this is just how much it wants to consume right now? Does anyone else have experience with calories naturally being lower after cutting out pufa? Should I be concerned about anything? I've never showed nutritional deficiency in a blood test, outside of low vitamin d. My energy levels are consistent although they've never been the greatest, but I stay pretty active. I rarely get sick. 

A little more context: pre quitting pufa my hunger would shift dramatically throughout my cycle. During the luteal phase (pmdd time) I would get urges to binge daily and would easily eat above 2.5k, which left me bloated and full all the time. During my follicular phase i naturally ate more like what my current eating habits are, and was not nearly as hungry. I assumed the two phases were just balancing each other out.",4,1729389291.0,SaturatedFat,0,1.0,False

* **Duration:** 2 nights, over the weekend
* **Weather:** Clear skies, daytime temps around 55°F (13°C), nights dropped to about 30°F (-1°C). Definitely needed the sleeping bag!
* **Gear:** Used a foldable tailgate table for the setup, along with a cozy sleeping bag and inflatable mattress for extra comfort.

Next day I came back home, everything was alright, but today I was complaining to her that Im not going to bathroom for many days, and that Im taking some lax, etc. So she said ""you look extremely thin. It could be irritable bowel syndrome or a colon câncer""
I froze for a couple seconds. Then I told her that could be a lot of things, and I will seek a gastroenterologist. She suggested for me to go to ER, but I will try to treat me at home for a couple days more.

Paul sat in his office, pecking at his keyboard and taking occasional sips from a cup of coffee that has long stopped steaming.

Only for his next sip to be interrupted by a ball of red fur suddenly clinging to his shoulder.

“WHATCHA' DOIN'?”

""Working, ironically on the file for that Arxur you terrified,"" the Human says, not so much as batting an eye at the Dossur.

Ketch scowls with an irritated grumble. “Damn dude, what does it take to make you jump?”

Paul sips from his coffee, eyes still locked to his monitor. ""Someone screaming ""Jellyfish!"" while I'm at a beach.""

Ketch quirked an eyebrow. “That your safeword or something.” She joked. Then the other eyebrow popped as the seed of thought she just planted in her own brain sprouted into a beanstalk. “OH-HO-HO, MAN!” She laughed. She skittered down his arm and right up to the monitor, standing on her hind leg pressing both paws against the screen so she could better read it. “What goes ON in that room?!”

""What goes on in that room is doctor-patient confidentiality and proper medical practice,"" the Human says, pulling the Dossur away from his monitor. ""And you say that as someone who's never been stung by Satan's Shopping Bag.""

Ketch gave a disappointed whine as she got gently dragged back by the torso. She was pretty sure she saw the words “Inferiority Issues” and that was it. At that last statement, though, Ketch looked up at him with wide eyes. “You got \**stinging*\* shopping bags?”

""No,"" Paul says as he pulls open a drawer, ""What we have are jellyfish, proof that nature has a wicked sense of humor.""

The Human puts the Dossur in the drawer, not bothering to close it as he turns back to the computer. ""Also, either eat the jerky I know you hid in there or throw it out, it's been in there for a while already.""

Ketch looked around the drawer, “Oh hey! THAT'S where I put those.”

Paul rolls his eyes, huffing a slight chuckle.

Ketch was getting the feeling that Paul wanted to be left alone, so she respected Paul’s request regarding the jerky, busied herself gathering the meat sticks from the drawer in silence…

…For about seven seconds before an impish impulse prompted her to pop her head up and blurt, “DOES HE HAVE A SMALL DICK? IS THAT HIS INFERIORITY ISSUE?”

Paul cuts his eyes at the Dossur, pushed her head down, and shut the drawer.

\* *“Reptiles have two dicks!. True story!”*\*

Paul rolled his eyes at the muffled parting shot and resume his typing in in silence. He didn’t bother opening the drawer. If the little gremlin could get in there on her own, then he was sure she could get out.

Sure enough, Ketch rolled the drawer open by pushing along the ceiling and got back to gathering jerky with a self satisfied snicker. She got resourceful at some point and started tying the sticks into bundles with some loose rubber bands so she could chuck them off edge and haul them to her nest in one go. In her search for more bands, shuffling and folding over forgotten scraps of paper to check under them, she found a photo. An old one with bent edges and scratches, showing three smiling humans. A big, round one with tanned skin and short dark hair, a young teen with long blond hair, and a man with golden-tan skin and long brown hair, whose body was toned like an Olympic swimmer.

“HeeEEYYy\~” Said Ketch, eying the muscular human like a particularly juicy fruit, “Stick me between THOSE pecs and call me a sandwich! Who’s this hottie, Paul?” She asked as she unconsciously made groping motions with her paws, kneading the image like a cat.

Paul raised an eyebrow, looking down into the drawer. ""Who're you talk-""

Only to pause midsentence, staring at Ketch with an unreadable expression.

A face that quickly became conflicted, switching between amusement, disgust, and shock.

""Ketch,"" he said gently, as if preparing to tell a patient that they're terminal, ""That's me.""

Ketch's fantasy swiftly came crashing down, with all the grace of a glass chandelier.

“EW!” Ketch reared away from the photo as if it had come alive, her ears flat, fur spiked, and tail stiff as a bored. “OKAY, SWIPE TO THE LEFT,” She declared, wiping her paws off on her thighs, ""WE’RE DONE!”

Paul shakes his head, leaning back in his chair as he picked up the photo, exposing the names on the back of it.

'Big Cool, Little Blue, Sweet'

""I honestly forgot that was in there,"" he said, rubbing a hand over his head as he examined the picture like it was a fossil, ""Just like I forgot that I used to be hot.""

“Yeah, no shit!” Said Ketch with her lip curled. Still reeling from the knowledge that she’d had dirty thoughts for Mr. Starchy-Ass McMidlife Crisis. She scampered up Paul’s shoulder to gawk at the uncanny photo with him. “I mean, was this back when you still strangled Mazics just to work up an appetite? You’re friggin RIPPED!”

Paul huffed, rubbing the frayed edge of the photo with a thumb. ""Nah, this was back in California, when I still surfed. Had to be, I don't know, twenty something years ago.""

The human smiles, a soft sort that Ketch had never seen on him, as he stares at the picture. ""Riding waves the way I did back then, it'd sculpt you like a fuckin' Michelangelo masterpiece, so long as you went light on the beach food.""

Ketch cocked her head and quirked an eyebrow at Paul in confusion. “You got hunky-lumps from sitting in a boat?”

That actually got a chuckle from the human.

""No Ketch, I didn't sit in a boat. Surfing is when you take a special-made board, head out into the water, and stand on it while waves pick it up and carry it. Skalga doesn't really have them, but back on Earth, those waves could get BIG.""

“Ooooh! Cool.” said Ketch with a nod. However, it was clear that she wasn’t imagining the highrollers or people zooming over the water on sleek boards. She was imagining a Human balancing on a plank while bobbing up and down on some big ass waves.

Paul shakes his head bemusedly, already knowing exactly where the Dossur's head had gone. ""I think I have a video or two of the competitions we entered somewhere on my computer or pad. Koa never let a good contest go unfilmed.""

Ketch nodded and gave a noncommittal hum as if to say ‘Okay, cool.'

Then she thought about it.

Then her eyes narrowed.

\**Wait, ‘competitions’?*\*

“… WAAAAAAAAAITAMINUTE!” she said, slowly turning to Paul with a paw on her hip and an ear cocked in inquiringly. “What kinda water bobbing IS this?”

Paul grins as he puts the photo aside, turning towards his computer. A few key strokes and clicks, and he found what he was looking for. ""This kind,"" he said as he pressed play.

\**""Long Beach is hanging high, let's see if he can -OOOOH, WIPE OUT! He's surfacing and swimming back to shore, no sign of his board anywhere!""*\*

Ketches eyes bulged as, instead of bobbing on loping waves, she saw a (sexy shirtless) human- for a split moment- ZOOMING along the side of a rolling tube of water! “WOAH-!” She leaned in as far as she could from her shoulder perch, literally and figuratively hanging on the edge of her seat, watching to see what would happen next.

""Yeah, that's what I was expecting,"" Paul says as he leans back in his chair. ""Just watch though, Koa's about to come up.""

Sure enough, the well-fed Human from Paul's photo was the next in the water, catching the wave with ease.

He stayed up longer than Ketch expected him to, riding high to the top of the wave as it eventually petered out.

Only to then ride high on the next wave, and the next after that.

“WOAH! WOAH!” Ketch barked excitedly, limbs suddenly spread out and tail erect, eyes wide with wonder, blown out of her little mind. “HOW’S ‘FAT GUY DOIN THAT?!” She jerked towards Paul “HOW’S ‘E MOVE’N LIKE THAT?!” She zipped around to his other shoulder to get a different angle. “IS THERE A MOTOR UNDER THERE!?” She flung herself to the top of the screen and pear at it upside down. “IS HE GETTING PUSHED BY A FISH?!” She leapt on top of Paul’s head. “DOES HE HAVE POWERS!?” She leaned way over and him in the eye, claws digging into his scalp. “IS IT MAGIC OR SOMETHING?! THAT’S SO AWSOME!!” EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!”

In the same rodent speed, the manic little new fan girl zipped around to Paul’s chest and grabbed him by the collar. “COME ON! WHATS THE WITCHCRAFT, MAN!?” She demanded, “I'M DYING HERE!”

Paul laughed, smiling wide as the Dossur scurried all over him and his desk. ""That's just Koa doing his thing,"" he said, still chuckling, ""No one could hang like Big Cool. Taught me and Chet how to surf, but that old Hawaiian was always better!""

“Uh-huh yeah sure.” Said Ketch like she didn’t know or care what that meant, then got right back to the important stuff with bright eyes. “HEY WE’RE GONNA GO DO THAT RIGHT?” She was almost bouncing on her feet there on Paul’s sternum.

Paul grinned down at Ketch with a raised eyebrow.  
""You sure?"" he asked, ""Those waves kill people, you know.""

“Yer' POINT?” Ketch asked wryly, “LEMME AT ‘EM!”

""Alright, alright!"" Paul chuckles, picking the photo back up, ""We ever get to Earth, I'll take you surfing with me. Start out on Koa's stretch of beach, waves there have always been chill.""

The Human looks back at the picture, eyes softening. ""I know Chet wants to take his kids to where we spread him, so he can meet them.""

Ketch, future Queen of the Waves, was now the happiest Dossur on the planet.

“WAH-HOO! ARIGHT!” The ecstatic rodent yelled as she scurried, leaped, and bounded around the man, his desk, and his chair, in a celebratory lap, leaving a lampshade spinning and nearly knocking over the computer monitor as she vaulted off of them. She stuck the landing atop Paul’s chair at the mention of Chet and fam, ears perked. “Beach party with the fat guy, SkalgaDude AND the Siv-kids!” Her tail perked up with an excited, happy series of twitches at the thought of being part of a full blown, joint family vacation, “I LOVE KIDS! This is gonna ROCK!”

But then she she proceeded the rest of Paul’s statement, namely 'Where we spread him,' and her tail slowly drooped as she put two and two together. After all, coming from a cleanse-by-fire culture, crematory rites were far from a foreign concept to her.

“OHHHHHhhhhhhh. . . . ” Ketch trailed off, glancing at the photo with awkward cringe. She kinda spoiled a moment there, didn’t she? OOPS. “Soooo Siv-fam and a dead guy, then?” She said in a weak attempt to patch up her irreverence.

Paul's smile dims some, but doesn't leave his face. ""Yeah, beach party with Chet's family and Koa. He would have loved to meet you, you know?"" Paul looks back down to the photograph, a certain sort of sheen to his eyes, one of nostalgia and long-spent mourning.

Ketch cocked her head back in surprise at the sudden sappy turn this conversation had taken. More so that it it was turned towards HER. This was… weird… awkward… and a little touching.

… Yeah, that was an I-Need-a-Hug kinda look right there. Time to switch gears.

Softly crawling onto the man’s shoulder and sitting herself down, Ketch looked up at his eye with a more sincere expression. “Yeesh, you really miss him, dont’cha?”

Paul looks over to her, staring in surprise for a moment before nodding.

""I do. Koa was. . . He was a good friend, one that always had the right advice. ""Wisest dude you'd find sleeping in the sand,"" as Chet put it.""

\**""Okaaaaaay, weird-ass expression.""*\* Ketch thought.

Paul looks back to the photo, bring a hand up to rest on Ketch's back. ""He passed five years ago, was the reason I came to Skalga, in fact. Heh, that video you saw was from that very year.""

Ketch lifted an eyebrow and dropped her ears as if both judging and pitying Paul’s decision. “Uh, yeah, hate to break it to ya, but you came to the wrong planet to mourn. V.P. SUCKS.” She shrugged “I mean don’t get me wrong! Screwing with Exterminators here is pretty fun- They’re NUTS- But. . .Yeah….” She rolled her eyes and bitterly mumbled. “Place just sorta kicks ya while you’re down,”

Paul huffs, nodding along to her words. ""That's the thing, it was Koa who convinced me. He told me ""There is work there that only Sweet can do, the way that Sweet can do it."" I had your same complaints, I'd heard the stories, but he insisted.""

Paul side eyes the dossur on his shoulder for a brief moment, before looking back to the photo. "". . . I'll be honest, I think I've come to see what he means. Something that he'd be pleased about, no doubt.""

Ketch blinked. Looked left, looked right, then cocked her head. “Ok first of all, Sweet? Wuzzat mean?”

Ketch was confused for a minute until she remembered the names on the back of the photo. “Is Sweet your nickname or something? Why do they call you- Wait, hang on. . ” Seized upon by sudden curiosity, she abruptly LICKED the humans earlobe and smacked her tongue thoughtfully as she considered the taste. “NnnnnNOPE. That ain’t it.”

Paul blinked.

""Never do that again."" He said with a perfectly flat tone. Then he continued. ""And it was because I was a good surfer. Heh, while I was never as good as Koa, nobody other than him could outdo me. ""He's sweet on those waves,"" they'd say back then. People repeating that is how Koa got the idea for the nickname.""

“Oh.” Nodded Ketch, sufficiently satisfied. *“\*Sweet\*.”*

Ketch looked at the image of the surfer frozen on the paused screen. Then back at her human, "". . . WELL COME ON!” She said with impatient excitement, “YOU GONNA PRESS PLAY OR WHAT?”

Paul actually laughs at that. Subdued, but a real laugh none the less.

""You're lucky you found that photo just when I finished with work,"" the Human said as he pressed play on the video.

Leaning back in his chair, Paul lets loose a quiet breath, and almost loses himself to watching the waves. He thinks about how he'd shift his board on them, where he'd put his feet, where his hands would hang.

A squeal from his shoulder reminded him he wasn't alone in watching the video. Looking over at the Dossur on his shoulder, enraptured by the moves of the surfers on the screen and mimicking their footwork herself, Paul smiles and shakes his head.

*""Fine, Big Cool,""* he thinks ruefully, looking back to the screen, *""You were right.""*",10,1729389099.0,NatureofPredators,1,1.0,False

I am memorizing him. The individual hairs, the way his uniform sleeve hangs.

He is the one important thing in my life now. He doesn’t know this, of course. My interest is not reciprocated. I am nothing. I am in here, he is out there. He has better things to do.

I am in a holding cell with three other guys. I don’t know what they’re in for. Two of them are asleep, the other just staring at the floor.

I’m in here for paying a fine. I got some bullshit ticket, and someone forgot to enter the payment. Then a week later this fine brave officer caught me in the act of walking home from the dollar store.

He got all excited about it, too. Got on his little radio, like I was some big fugitive. He just nabbed Dillinger all by himself. I still had the receipt from the fine in my wallet, but that made no difference to this courageous hero. So here I am, in a glass-walled holding cell till morning. I am nothing if not patient.

He’s my favorite. He has cool sunglasses and short sleeves, and he is doing paperwork like a real pro. I am nothing. He doesn’t need to remember me. I’ve made deliveries to his house four or five times, but there’s no need to remember some delivery guy. He is such a good cop. I bet everyone says so. Nice family.

Ooh, look, he’s moving around now. Went to chat with some other fine officers. He seems to be working nights now. That’s nice. That’s good to know.

Just stroll around, officer. Just take your time. Get some coffee. It will help keep you alert for those dangerous fine-paying sidewalk-using criminals out there. Gotta keep the community safe from those maniacs. They might walk all over those sidewalks.

Just chat away, free as a bird. I wonder if the deskrider who failed to record my payment will be arrested too. I would guess not. Just a wild, crazy assumption.

Somewhere in this building is a yellow plastic bag with some cans of tuna and a package of crackers. It was all I could get. Eighty dollars pretty well tapped me out. In here they provided a dry biscuit with synthesized egg in it. I ate it, watching this admirable officer having his lunch out there.

A decent house. White, with dark green around the windows. No dogs that I ever noticed. Big deck in back, sliding doors. Pretty isolated too, for being so close to town. Lots of nice tall bushes and trees. Very quiet.

There he goes, heading out to patrol the mean streets. Maybe someone will be sitting dangerously on a bench, or committing acts of public breathing.

Go ahead, Officer Davis of Morningside Lane. Go keep the community safe. I'll have to drop by sometime for dinner.",1,1729389069.0,DivaythStories,0,1.0,False

Alright, everyone, this was a really good session. Special thanks to Paula for the Meat Lovers' Pizza, we all know we have a lot of meat lovers here. So then, before we go home, let's all say our pledge:

\[chanting\] “Brains are for the brainless! I am not a bad horror movie cliché. And when I want to eat someone, I'll have snack. If I still want to eat them, I'll have a meal. If then I still want to eat them, I'll call my big sibling. But what I will never do is eat someone!”

Yeah, that was good, everyone! I am so proud of you all! Wait, before we all go home, one more thing: The hand we found last week is still lying in my office. Anyone missing a hand? It's a left hand without any fingers missing. If that thing does not get claimed by next week, I'll throw it away. I mean it, I want it gone!

Okay, then, see you all next week. Get home safe and don't lose your head!

\[chairs moving, chatter\]

Uhm, hey, buddy, wait a moment! Do you have a minute? Great! What? No, nothing's wrong! I just wanted to tell you, uhm, I mean, you were really great. No, not today. Oh, uhm, I mean, you were also great today, of course, but I mean, you were rather great, like, in general. A lot of the people here really look up to you, and you are a really great big sibling to Rodney. Poor Roddy really had some problems at first with the whole Not Eating People thing, but you helped him so much and now look at him! He was so proud when you gave him his One Year Of Not Eating Anybody award, and he recognizes his triggers so well, and he holds a job now! Yeah, the coastal guard is hiring a lot of zombies lately. Diving is a lot easier for people who don't need to breathe, I guess.

But anyway, he wouldn't have managed to achieve any of that without your help and guidance. You are really great, is what I'm trying to say. Oh, come on, will you just once accept a damn compliment? I really mean it! Roddy is doing so well since you took him under your wing – plus, do you think there is something going on between him and Paula? I mean, have you seen how he jumped to help her pick up her lower jaw when she dropped it during the pledge last week? No, seriously, I mean it! Come on, they'd be a sweet couple, don't you think?

Speaking of which, didn't you say *you* had a date last week? Oh, uhm, no reason! I'm just curious. Hey, what is it? No, no, I know that face! Last time I saw that face you emptied the conference room's entire fridge, including a whole stick of butter, because you wanted to eat that chick who had gotten to the wrong room and thought this was the werewolf defleaing campaign. Oh, come on, don't gimme that! *I* wanted to eat that chick! No need to feel bad about it. I mean, you had it under control, didn't you? And that's exactly why everyone here looks up to you!

Anyway, so what about that date? Did it go bad? Okay. Now that doesn't sound too bad. Uh-hum. Hey, that's great, isn't it? But then wha- oh. Gosh, no, you do not smell of embalming fluid! Uhm, I mean, I don't really know, to be frank. Like, I probably do, too. I'm trying out a new brand of embalming fluid, it's called Secret Of The Pharaohs. My friend Nefertiti recommended it. She's a mummy, you know? It's a bit on the pricey side, actually, but I thought, you gotta treat yourself sometimes, right? I was actually a bit miffed when nobody complimented me on it. I *always* say something when someone in the group put on a nice new embalming fluid! Huh? Oh, thank you!

Anyway, back to that date of yours! Do you mean she ditched you just because you smelled like- oh. What do you mean, “that wasn't all”? Come on, tell me what happened! Huh? Oh, for real now! Everybody loses an arm sometimes! That was not your fault! That bitch was just being prissy!

Hey, chin up! If you ask me, you should be happy you got rid of that bitch! She doesn't deserve you!

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop that! Don't talk about yourself that way! Of course you deserve someone! You just haven't found the right one yet, that's all!

Okay, wow! Stop it! Right now! You are not a monster! Do we really need to get back to the first step of the program? \[reciting by heart\] “I am not a monster, I am just a normal person with an unusual problem” You taught that to Rodney more than a year ago, now don't let him see you forgetting all of it yourself! That guy idolizes you!

Hey, I know that dating as a zombie is hard! I am a zombie myself, remember? You know how my last date went? They first threw a bunch of vinyls at me and then tried to bash my head in with a cricket bat! Oh, don't you worry! That was more than a year ago, so-

Yeah, I haven't been dating in quite some time. I mean, I have my job at the DMV, and I got this support group, you know, I gotta organize the meetings and make sure someone brings snacks and that the coffee filters get restocked and stuff. Like, I don't actually have time for stuff like dating or whatever. I wouldn't quite say I've given up on it, I just, uhm, haven't found the right one yet. Yeah, same old song, huh?

Never mind! I actually just wanted to talk to you because, uhm, you see- I wanted to ask- are you- are you already doing anything on the weekend? Oh, uhm, no reason, I just wondered if maybe, I mean, if you have no other plans, and I mean, we know each other for quite some time now, and I was planning to make some meatloaf on Saturday, and you know, you cannot make just one serving of meatloaf, you have to make, like, one big loaf, or else, what's even the point, am I right? And I don't have anyone to share it with and I'm not a big eater, so I'd be eating that meatloaf for a week, probably, so I just wanted to ask if maybe, if you do not already have any other obligations on Saturday – I mean, if you do, that would be totally okay, and I could also make my meatloaf on Sunday if you-

Oh. You- you want to? Really? That's great! Because I was so worried because you said you had a date last week, and I didn't wanna ask you, but if you and that chick are not a thing now, then I guess we can-

No, it's not a date! It's just two people having dinner together. Uhm, and maybe, if you want to, we could have a little walk afterwards? Like, there is this little park just down the road from my apartment, and it's got that little pond, and at night, when the moon reflects off the surface of the pond, it's just really roman- beautiful! It's just really beautiful!

Oh, you'd love to? That's great! So then, Saturday at my place it is, yeah? Excellent! I'm looking forward to it! No, it's not a date!

Hey, why do you look so disappointed? Oh. Would you- want it to be a date? Really? Aww- no, I'm not blushing! I don't have any circulation, therefore I am not blushing!

Okay then, uhm, fine. Then it *is* a date. Wow. I'm really looking forward to it. I have a feeling this is gonna be great. You are a really amazing person. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise! And now get home safe – and don't lose your head!",2,1729389017.0,ASMRScriptHaven,0,1.0,False

Woke at around 10am. And until 4pm today I’ve done Jack shit. I didn’t go on my phone or anything or waste time (I don’t play games not watch TV). I was supposed to study today for a good amount but like wtf, 6 hours went by and I haven’t done a single item on my to do list.

It’s not that I feel unproductive but it’s like this phenomenon that time is just so fast in the morning especially. How the fuck does it take me 4 hours to cook and eat my breakfast, drink my coffee and get myself ready..? I usually wake up at 9-10am and I’m “ready” by 1-2pm. How the fuck does that happen???

What I’ve said maybe wasn’t so clear, but my question is, is there a way to be “consistently” productive?

On the RARE occasions in the mornings I’m pretty productive. It’s more common for me in the evening to be more productive. Anyway I can just be consistently productive like 6/7 days in the week? Need to take a “relax/chill” day of course.",6,1729388883.0,OntarioGrade12s,5,1.0,False

Hey Reddit,
I’m in a pretty tough situation right now and could use some perspective. My two best friends, Nicole and Nathan, just ended their 4-year relationship. Here’s the backstory:

Nicole (22) and Nathan (28) had been dating in secret because their families were against the relationship—Nicole is Muslim, and Nathan is Roma. Despite the challenges, Nicole was always willing to stand up to her family for their love. Nathan, however, recently admitted he could never do the same, which led to their breakup.

This has completely shattered Nicole, and as her friends, we’ve all rallied around her. I’ve been meeting with her every day since the breakup for dinner, coffee, drinks—anything to help her feel supported. She’s asked us not to have any contact with Nathan, and we’ve all agreed to respect her wishes, with some of us even unfollowing him on social media.

Here’s where it gets complicated for me:
Nathan and I were incredibly close as well. We shared birthdays, had mutual parties, went on trips together, and got to know each other’s families. I genuinely thought of him as a friend I’d keep for life. But after seeing how hurt Nicole is, I feel angry and frustrated with him for leading her on all these years, knowing he’d never fully commit. At the same time, I’m sad to lose him as a friend, and it’s been painful not to talk to him or find any closure.

I’m trying to support Nicole, but it’s a lot to carry. I feel torn between the deep bond I had with Nathan and my loyalty to Nicole. I’m sad, I’m angry, and I’m not sure how to navigate these feelings while being the best friend I can to Nathan.

1g7nzpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1g7nzpc/9_days_trip_from_toronto_canada/,"9 days - Trip from Toronto, Canada","hi everyone,

  
long time lurker and wanted to make a post on my trip to Iceland for 9 days from toronto to help any fellow travellers coming with cost and pricing! we got lots of good tricks and tips from other reddit posters as well, so wanted to give back 

1. **our dates:** We went from **September 28 - Oct 7th**, which i felt was perfect as you can see the northern lights almost every other day 
   1. only thing i would call out is that many campsites are closed for winter which starts October 1st, but since its off season, there's fewer people anyways at the campsites we were at. 
   2. I would check online if there's particular areas up north you want to go to, and see if their campsites are open
2. **accommodations:** we booked [https://happycampers.is/camper/happy-1/](https://happycampers.is/camper/happy-1/) and with the add-ons/ insurance that we got, it cost us a total of: **$3270 CAD**
   1. most campsites we stayed at averaged about $65 CAD per night for 2 people, so our total cost (includes shower, taxes etc) there was: **$522** for our 8 nights there
      1. if you are nervous about cleanliness coming from canadian and us campgrounds, the washrooms here are *immaculate*, they get cleaner the more up north you go, and even the rest stops on ring road are very very nice.
   2. I would highly recommend happy campers - they provided everything we needed in the van, plus their wifi worked perfectly and their campsite map was awesome! 
      1. my partner is 6'2"" and slept comfortably in the van. you can run the heating all night, so it gets quite cozy
3. **flights:** i used my american express points to cover my partner's flight to iceland, so we only had to pay for 1 person + checked bag + had to pay to have our seats together on the way back to total of **$1069 CAD**
   1. we flew icelandair from toronto, would recommend it, it was a relatively good experience 
4. **groceries:** we had a paid for a checked bag from toronto that was filled with non-perishable items we could cook in the van (i.e. indomie, beans, ready made pasta, protein bars, fruit snacks, soup), so we only really bought milk, eggs, bread, sausages, butter, protein shakes, fruit, giving us a total of **$147 CAD**
   1. if you are choosing to do a camper van, where you pick up the rental they have non-perishables that previous campers have left behind, I would recommend taking salt, pepper & ketchup from there so you don't have to buy a whole packet for yourself
5. **gas:** happy campers had an N1 discount about 10%, so we ended up filling up gas there or at an Orkan, which ended up with a total of: $**521 CAD**
   1. this is the most expensive, it's about $3+/litre, which was quite shocking to my partner and I who live in vancouver and already pay quite a bit for gas.
6. **spas:** we didn't do any excursions, but my partner and I did go to Myvatn Baths and Sky Lagoon: **$382 CAD**
   1. We did get a 10% discount at Myvatn since we were with Happy Campers
   2. For sky lagoon, we paid for the 7 step ritual - please do this, it is worth it
7. **parking:** highly recommend getting the parka app before you land in iceland, just makes parking so much easier. most sites ranged around $6-$10, so for our total trip, we paid about **$68**  for parking.
8. **eating out:** we tried to reduce eating out as much as we could, but sometimes you just get hungry and tired of eating hot dogs, so we spent about **$278** in eating out
   1. this was mostly in Reykjavik, where we went to Cafe Loki & Islenski Barinn & dirty burgers and rib
   2. we got pizza from this campground in Myvatn, which was about $37 - really good
   3. we did buy coffee a couple times too, such as at the American Schoolbus Cafe and Akureyi Botanical Gardens (adds up to about $20 for 2 people)
      1. Both I would highly recommend going too
      2. We didn't go to skool beans, but another redditor said american schoolbus had better coffee and would be less busy, so we went here instead. the aesthetic is very nice and we do not regret it at all
9. **drinks:** we bought icelandic beer, about 2 packs of 6 for about **$64** at duty free and lived off of that 
   1. highly recommend doing this - buy your alcohol at the start 
10. I'll leave souvenirs out, because this is where we went a bit too crazy with icelandic wool blankets and a Bering watch but you can get reasonably priced souvenirs like magnets, mugs, pins, postcards, in most places near Akureyi and Reyjavik 
11. This brings the total cost of our trip to: **$6323.56 CAD,** or **$3126 CAD** per person 
12. Feel free to message me if you have any questions! Driving around Iceland was the happiest my partner and I have ever been in our entire lives. I would encourage everyone to go if they can",1,1729388262.0,VisitingIceland,1,1.0,False

I'd really like to change that so I figured this might be a fun spot to start. I am looking for someone who is mostly local, though I don't mind long drives.

I also like TV shows, movies, books, lots of form of entertainment. I enjoy cooking (especially for others) but I'm not the best at it. I'm especially bad at baking unless it's cookies or brownies.

Also, I am currently going through an episode of low mood, so I'm not in the greatest mind, but I'm aware and I do enough therapy to point out spiraling or catastrophizing thought patterns.

I'm 36, I've had a habit of isolating and I've gotten a lot better at making an effort to stay out and do stuff after work or on days off. 

I also have noticed that I seem to constantly be looking everywhere for a partner; at work, outside, at the coffee shop, legit everywhere.

I then realized that I am expecting women to approach me romantically in places that aren't typical. OK, cool, I get that but where do people meet? Dating events are overrun by guys and due to CPTSD, I don't value myself as much as I could. I'm doing trauma therapy and it is helping immensely, but they are core beliefs and it will take time.

I have friends, a lot more than I realize and one thing that bothers me is women don't approach me or seem interested in me. Despite trying in the form of hanging out, stating my intentions and just trying to be a caring person to another person.

I'd like to think there must be some reason, but that is my attempt at controlling the situation and due to past coping methods, that involved blaming myself when in reality, it is just random who likes me and who doesn't. 

Is there anything I can do to better my odds? Or does it simply just happen randomly? I try to put myself in social situations and every situation that I find myself in, I reason that it may not be the best place to meet someone romantically, so I don't go out of my way to do more than seem interested in meeting somebody new.

I'd like to think that I try to come off as a genuine dude, but I still don't have women taking in interest in me, that I'm aware of. Statistically, it has to happen but I'm just unaware because they may be shy or something, but I don't have people wanting to hang out or even just talk. 

I understand people have their own lives and they don't revolve around me, but I think about it a lot and I'm reasoning that I'm must be missing something. 

I welcome constructive criticism, but you're only seeing this one side of me and it doesn't really reflect who I am outside of the internet, so it may not be a good reflection of how I portray myself, but instead how I think.

1g7nyi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/1g7nyi9/dining_hall_feedback/,Dining Hall Feedback,"Unfortunately, my recent experience at the enchanted Busch Dining Hall left little to be desired...

Upon entering the dining hall, There was a woman sitting at a desk, waiting for me to scan my Rutgers ID card in order to utilize my ""meal swipe."" Not once was I  greeted with a smile, addressed by name, or simply ""acknowledged."" It felt very transactional, as if she wanted me just to tap my card, ensure I had enough meal swipes, and get out of there...

As I walked further into the dining hall, I couldn't help but notice the overwhelmingly industrial feel to the space. Instead of feeling warm and inviting, the gray tiles that line the walls as well as the distasteful choice in furniture reduce this place to a ""chow arena"", rather than a place to relax and dine. 

My visit was during the wee hours of the morning, therefore breakfast service was fully underway. As I meander through the main buffet space, which is quite peculiarly designed might I say, I found myself utterly disappointed with what I saw. Instead of seeing what I consider ""normal"" breakfast options, such as eggs benedict, a fresh fruit section, a diverse cheese and cold cuts selection, artisan bread and pastries, breakfast meats, among others, the antithesis of those items lay before me. 

The only egg options were omelettes, cooked-to-order, and scrambled eggs. Upon first glance, the scrambled eggs appeared dry, and the omelette station seemed to be missing many ingredients, such as sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese. The fruit selection was basic, there were no mangoes, papayas, or pineapples, essential to a good fruit selection. What was offered rather were strawberries and blueberries, that while appearing fresh, did not reflect the multitude of options found in other buffets.

What saddened me the most, however, was the complete absence of a cheese and cold cut section. My usual selections, such as camembert, brie, and gruyere, were nowhere to be found within the confines of this space. In such dire situations, I would have in fact settled for a slice of emmental with bread or british aged cheddar. Nope, none of that. No prosciutto, jamon iberico,  salami, or bresaola either. Truly a sad day indeed.

There was a ""pastry section,"" if I may call it so, which offered warm croissants and biscuits on one end, and around the other side of the wall, breakfast toast, bagels, and donuts. There were no baguettes, and not even pain au chocolat! I thought these were the bare minimum in breakfast buffets. 

I ended up settling for some scrambled eggs, breakfast sausage, and a croissant, washed down with a drip coffee with milk. I prefer cappuccinos, however, given lack of proper cappuccino cups, I was not to be caught drinking a cappuccino out of a plastic cup. 

My scrambled eggs tasted tasted fine, but underwhelming. The breakfast sausage lacked the full flavor profile of artisanal sausages. As I bit into my croissant, I could not help but envision a frenchman screaming in contempt. The flaky crust and the goey, buttery soft pastry inside was non existent with this croissant. It was tough and flavorless, and quite frankly, they are bold to call that a croissant. May God help them if they come across an actual french person in the near future.

As I took a sip of my coffee, I noticed it to be quite watery, dull, and generic. This was my last straw. If I had the energy, I would have certainly marched over and demanded a corporate number to lodge a complaint. Yet, this seemed overly time consuming and would likely yield an unsatisfactory outcome, so I resisted.

Having no choice, I ate the rest of my food, put away my plates on the conveyor belt, and left. I was also not sent off with a ""thank you, goodbye!"" or a ""come again!"" I was on the verge of tears at this point, both in sadness and in sheer frustration.

I cannot say I was impressed with this dining experience. I felt very invisible throughout this entire process, feeling like merely a ""number"" rather than a valued guest. I felt no effort to make this experience tailored to me and my needs, which was very disappointing. I also find it unacceptable to lack a cheese and cold cut section, as well as a robust selection of pastries. I do hope this improves expeditiously. ",0,1729388147.0,rutgers,1,0.33,False

The tale of friendship and tenancy,"I need to VENT about this circumstance. I have worked through my partner healing from abusive partners and finding their voice over the past few years. We are getting married and I will be joining her in her business which oversees/owns the current duplex we live in. We are fixing up some areas on the property, and our tenant had met my partner through a yoga school. My partner had bought a piece of property and the tenant (let’s call her Jane) had brought an idea up to my partner. Jane suggested she encourage students from her school to rent the duplex and the house that is also on the property as “live in” students (from my understanding it’s a style of training). This would have helped with my partner to have solid tenants and it would help build her school. The house needed to be completely renovated, so the rent was reduced in exchange for labor to fix up the property from Jane/students. Since then it’s been almost two years, there has been zero help (mostly on my partner as owner imo), and my partner/Jane have grown apart (mostly because of my partners job/separate interests). The relationship between Jane and my partner is a little complex because of their first year of training/friendship. My partner lost her father and found a lot of healing through training. She has had to separate idolizing Jane as what she loves about training and her actual training (aka she can love training without Jane being her teacher). This has been a particularly tough journey for her, especially given her past relationships/friendships. She has done great, and this is not about her. I recognize those growing areas (and choose that along with all the wonderful things about her), but I am not a fan of Jane. 

Jane borrowed my partners car for about a year until she needed it again. At that point, Jane got her own car and returned my partner’s completely trashed (dog hair, food, etc). They also started to let their husband drive the car without telling her (husband not on insurance), and replaced one tire when it got a nail. The registration was not updated (part of the deal) and it needed maintenance. 

Jane would ask my partner to bring her coffee, cigarettes, food whatever else back when we first started dating. She stopped doing that after we got more serious, but always felt it was predatory in the time of my partner seriously grieving. Im saying that understanding that this was “traditional” supposedly in a sense, but even if it is that just doesn’t sit well with me. It was frequent enough and on no particular schedule. 

Jane imo crossed the boundary on some personal topics, using comedic relief such as “fuck that guy” when trying to navigate grief, giving mental health advice I don’t think they had any business giving, giving career advice when they are not making consistently making rent (see below), and always came at it in a teacher way. Jane also kindly advised my partner to “not be afraid to be a landlord to them” 🥴 

Was paying rent 2-3 weeks late for a few months until my partner had a convo with them. They had a grand pitch that they would be on time, they were for two months, then started paying late again 

So, as we are building this business together, I checked in to ask if they had paid rent this month. My partner said Jane let her know she was sending the funds but never did. We are 3 weeks late, and apparently this is not the first time since the last convo. Jane also was supposed to put her name down on a renovation sheet we have (dates are pretty wide open and this is in exchange for the reduced rent) and didn’t do that either. I asked my partner if she knew when it was coming so I could mark it, and she texted Jane (😒). Jane called immediately, sent the rent immediately, and asked for my partner to call them back when they didn’t answer. My partner and I decided this wasn’t conversation, the payment part should be cut and dry, and that they would find a way to express that to them when they work together (Jane also had signed up after). 

Fast forward to tonight, Jane calls on her first day of painting. My partner called back to make sure it wasn’t a question on painting and we agreed to keep it short/business like on the phone (if it needed to be deeper that would be in person) and before I know it I hear Jane bringing up the rent and wanting to talk about it and y’all I lost it 😂 my gut says she was feeling out my partner after no response 

Maybe I’m going cuckoo but as someone who has had an unbiased view of this relationship- it genuinely sucks from a landlord perspective. If everyone who was renting at a reduced price left, we would make double. From a personal perspective- I think Jane is manipulative and it makes me mad the way she has treated my partner. I don’t know her well enough to say if it’s malicious or not, but I’m seeing the other yoga student that lives on the property bring Jane food and groceries and is nervous to talk to them (like my partner was idolizing at first) it’s really starting to give me the ick. With her being late again it’s now on my radar, I’m really just trying to gauge if I am overreacting or if she truly is just giving off red flags.

Symptoms driving me nuts,"So I started road cycling in the summer of 2022 for exercise.  When the weather turned in the fall of 2023, I bought an indoor bike trainer and had a lot of fun.  But I found when I'd ride, my penis would go numb.  I think it's from the fixed position of the seat.  

By December, 2023, I saw my doctor as I was having issues where I was urinating frequently, and it felt like I never emptied by bladder.  Pee, flush, and then have to go again.  Like 10 times in half an hour.  

Doc checked prostate, said it was fine, no issues showing in blood or urine.  He thinks it was the bike seat.

Well I rested up, and like a moron, I felt better so I started cycling indoors again, and the symptoms never came back, despite the numbness I got (stupid, I know).  Never happened when I rode outdoors, so I think it was the fixed position of my indoor bike.

So a few weeks ago, the symptoms came back.  Frequent urination, like go, sit down, go, sit down.  And sometimes I'd need to urinate, stand there, it would hesitate and then dribble out a bit, then come out normally, then cut out, dribble, normal.  

So I took more time off cycling.  And my symptoms got better, so I went out and got a split bike seat with a big cutout in the middle.  I rode once and it felt way better.  But the numbness came back.  And then after just ONE indoor 30 minute ride, the urge to urinate came back.

First came the hesitancy, where I'd feel the need to urinate, and stand at the toilet, a bit would dribble out, and then a weak stream.  And so I'd only pee a bit at a time.  

And so as funny as it sounds, I got anxiety around going to the bathroom.  And around not being near a bathroom.  

But as the days went on, the symptoms have been slowly improving.  I cycled on Tuesday, and by Saturday (today) they feel a lot better.  Not completely gone, but better.  

Today I had a coffee and a bunch of water, because I was worried about urine retention and hurting my kidneys.  I've been peeing a TON, but it's coming out clear, and the hesitancy is mostly gone.  Good, strong stream.  Not as ""wide"" as normal, but not as skinny as the stream was before.

Is it possible it is a urethral stricture? But then would it get any better?  

If the hesitancy is mostly gone but the frequent urination remains, is that good, or bad?  I don't feel I need to push as hard to urinate, and I'm peeing much more normally.  But there is still a BIT of a feeling of needing to pee, like my bladder is always irritated.  

I see my doctor next week.

1g7nhq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g7nhq1/please_read_if_youre_going_through_it/,Please Read if you're going through it,"My reasons to not contact them and I hope this resonates with some of you:

1. They can find ways to reach out to me and they choose not to. They made the relationship crumble so they should be the ones reaching out with a plan, not just a simple ""how are you"".
2. I haven't spoken to them in weeks. For all I know they're already talking to someone else and I'd rather be ignorant to that fact than me reaching out and they tell me this. It would hurt me.
3. They may leave me on read or have me blocked. This would hurt.
4. They may respond but they're trying to be nice. The outcome I'm expecting is not what will happen 99% of the time. 
5. I'm not begging someone to be with me and I'm certainly not going to text them to talk to them about things we've previously talked about during the breakup. They already know how we feel and there is no amount of begging or forcing that we can do to change the fact that they don't want us.

The whole point is that things didn't work at this point in time. There's nothing that can change that and there was a reason for the breakup. Millions of people go through it everyday, we're not the only ones. We should grieve, feel, and attempt to move on.

Things that have helped also:
1. Not checking their socials or statuses. If this is hard to do, just delete the social or messaging apps until the strong urge passes. I had to do this and I felt much better.
2. Don't think they'll be coming back; try to get this thought out of your mind. I know social media and sometimes this forum makes us have hope but it is highly unlikely that they'll come back. Life is not black and white, it may or may not happen but for now they haven't come back. Use this time to work on you.
3. Read books, buy a new video games, download uplifting music, change your hair color, go to a spa and get a massage, download a game on your phone, watch funny videos, go out with friends or family,  set new goals at the gym, join run clubs or reading clubs, go sit at a coffee shop or bar and take yourself out on dates (I went and watched a movie on my own and it was bliss).
4. Don't rebound; I went on a date and although the person was amazing I was emotionally closed off. I kept comparing them to my ex and everything started to annoy me. Take a few months off dating at this time and see if after a few months you're ready for it.
5. Read the book ""Attached"". It helped me learn about attachment styles and how we can see red flags early on.
6. Create a new daily routine. This is easier said than done but the fact is that we are in a loop and our days were planned around our exes. Be it that good morning text, daily calls of FT, doing things together, etc. It's TIME to create a new routine. I used to wake up and look at my phone. Now I fight the urge to look at my phone and just go straight to shower, make coffee, etc. He used to call me midday everyday, that was our thing. Now I go to the gym midday to fill up that time and not feel the void as much. The point is, make a list of things you do or want to do on a daily and switch it up.
7. There are times you want to talk to someone because of the pain or the loneliness or boredom. I have found that ChatGPT is amazing at deciphering my feelings. Sometimes I talk to it as if that's my ex and it replies back. I vent to it, I ask it questions and it helps. If ChatGPT is not your thing, the Unsentletters forum here on Reddit is amazing. Whenever I need to vent, I write in the forum and it really helps me release whatever it is that I feel. Try it out.
8. Shut off your phone's notifications. Trust me, it works. When we don't hear the notifications or we block them, our minds subconsciously stops looking for them. I did this and the only notifications I didn't block were that of my best friend and my mom. Whenever I see them on my phone, I know is them. I would physically have to open up the messaging app or social media to be able to see any other type of notification.
9. Download the ""I Am"" app on your phone. It sends you periodic words of affirmation and when I tell you it has done so much good in my life overall, im not lying. It just sent me one and it says ""I choose to be happy"". I keep repeating it until it resonates.
10. Finally, Feeeeeeeel the feelings. We try to be strong and push our feelings to the back of our heads and heart but that doesn't work. Hence why there's some people who are still heartbroken YEARS after they broke up with the person. They didn't let themselves grieve and feelings have a way of catching up to us. Science has backed up the fact that we go through stages when we grieve and if we skip some of them, those stages will absolutely return at some point in our life, be it years from now.

You'll get through this but you have to put in the work.

Then the pandemic happened, everyone had to do their work remote, as it was a global health scare. However because of the collapsing economy at the time I got a letter from my HR department and I was let go.

This hurts because I worked my way up in the company, I won't say the name because I don't want people to harass them, but it's a pretty large company. I was told that this job had good security, I thought this job had good security as well.

They just let me go, I spent years of my youth into this company and made them around a million dollars, and they just threw me into the wind when time gets rough.

I felt a little betrayed, but I don't want to spend too much time feeling sorry for myself. So I started a cleaning company with my friend that also got laid off with me.

It took off, we are currently making on average 3K/day.

We have our team that we work with, we have no office, closest thing to that is coffee shops and our van, where we commute and store our cleaning equipment in.

Honestly, we are happy we got laid off, I get to move around and make 5-6 times more than my corporate job. It has flexible hours, and I don't have to feel worried about getting laid off.

1g7neau,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1g7neau/bizarre_experience_at_the_coffee_shop/,Bizarre experience at the coffee shop,"So today I finally decided to actually leave my apartment and go to this coffee shop down the street. It's a nice place, usually quite crowded on weekends, so I've never actually stayed there, I'd always just take my food/drink to go. But today, I said you know what? Fuck it. I'm gonna actually push myself to just sit by myself and not care what people think about me. Easier said than done. I get there, place my order, and await for my number. My heart's pounding. I can feel myself starting to sweat, like everyone's staring at me. Take a few deep breaths, ground myself, look around, and I'm calmed down because I realized literally nobody cares I'm there.

Okay cool! Get my food and tea, and decide to embrace the beautiful weather and sit outside. No sooner do I take a seat outside before this really cute redheaded girl comes by on her bike. She orders one coffee and sits adjacent from me. After a minute of silence, she says to me ""beautiful day, huh?"" ""Oh absolutely"" I say. Literally in disbelief because this NEVER happens to me. Nobody, least of all some pretty lady EVER strikes up any verbiage at all to me.

We just make chit chat for a little while, maybe 5 minutes, and I was super nervous at first, but decided to just roll with it and see where the conversation goes. Well, it went south. And fast! She asks me where I live, and I tell her I live nearby, close enough to walk. She gives me this almost worried look and says ""I could never live here in this neighborhood. Too many blacks.""

At this point, I'm totally taken aback and in my head I'm like, wtf??? And she goes on. ""I have nothing against black people. Some of my best friends are black! But well, you *know* what I mean."" I tell her honestly I don't, and she just goes on and on, and at this point I'm trying to intervene and even change topics, but she will not stop! I think she seriously was close to throwing out the forbidden word at one point. When it became obvious this was a no-win scenario for me, I pretend to look shocked at my phone, tell her I forgot I was supposed to help my friend move some furniture. She told me I was a ""really good listener"" and we should meet here again and even asked for my number. I sorta froze and told her I didn't have a cell phone (she clearly saw me look at my phone).

This might be the first time in my entire life where I nope'd out of a conversation with anyone that wasn't due to my social anxiety lol.

Walking back home, I couldn't help but crack up. Like, this could be a plot line to a Louis CK episode haha. It was such a surreal experience, I'm honestly still hung up on it. Of course, this is what happens to me literally the ONE time I decide to not be a hermit in my apartment.

1g7n8h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelFanStory/comments/1g7n8h1/solarman_the_man_of_marvel/,SolarMan: The Man of Marvel,"It was a time of great change in New York City. A mysterious and powerful gene called ""The Catalyst"" was spreading across the globe, unlocking superhuman abilities in people who never dreamed of possessing such power. Among those affected were an African man named Sekou and a Puerto Rican woman named Luna. Both had lived in NYC for most of their adult lives, yet their paths only crossed when destiny intervened.



### Chapter 1: Love Amidst the Stars



Sekou was a strong, kind-hearted man who ran a small but beloved general store in Harlem. He had built a reputation as a reliable figure in the community, always ready to help those in need. With his warm smile and resourceful nature, he had become an integral part of the neighborhood.



Luna, meanwhile, was an astrologist with a deep fascination for the stars and the mysteries of the cosmos. She worked at an observatory in the Bronx, gazing into the night sky for hours, wondering what secrets the universe held. Her love for the unknown and the vastness of space reflected the spirit of adventure that defined her.



Their worlds collided one crisp autumn evening when Luna stopped by Sekou’s store to pick up supplies for an astrology workshop. Sekou, ever the charmer, struck up a conversation with her about the stars. They discovered a mutual passion for learning, exploration, and a shared desire to understand the universe in their own unique ways. It wasn’t long before they fell in love.



A year later, their son, Elias, was born—a bright, curious boy who always had his nose in a book or a notepad, scribbling down his observations about the world around him. But as Elias grew older, he became a magnet for bullies. His glasses and love for journalism made him an easy target, but he endured the ridicule, dreaming of one day becoming the best reporter in New York City. 



### Chapter 2: The Rock from the Stars



One fateful afternoon, Elias was wandering through the park near their home, as he often did to clear his mind and escape the taunts of his peers. He carried his notebook, jotting down observations about the birds, the trees, and the sky. That’s when he saw it—a strange, glowing rock lying in the middle of a clearing in the nearby forest.



It wasn’t like anything he’d ever seen before. Pulsating with energy, the rock seemed alive. Compelled by an overwhelming sense of curiosity, Elias approached and reached out to touch it.



The moment his hand made contact, a surge of energy shot through his body, powerful and blinding. He screamed as his senses were overwhelmed, and before he knew it, he collapsed to the ground, unconscious.



Hours later, Sekou and Luna found him in the forest, frantic with worry. 



""Elias!"" Sekou yelled, his heart pounding as he knelt beside his son, shaking him gently. ""Wake up, son! Please, wake up!""



Luna fell to her knees beside her husband, her hands trembling as she cradled Elias’s head. ""Elias, can you hear me?"" she whispered, tears in her eyes. ""Please, wake up…""



It felt like an eternity, but finally, Elias stirred. He opened his eyes, his body weak and his mind foggy. ""Mom…Dad…what happened?""



""We were so worried about you!"" Luna cried, pulling him into her arms. ""We couldn’t find you anywhere. How did you get here?""



""I…I don’t know,"" Elias mumbled, sitting up slowly. ""There was this rock…and then…everything went black.""



Sekou frowned, his eyes scanning the area. ""A rock? What kind of rock?""



""I don’t know, Dad. It was glowing…like it was alive.""



Luna and Sekou exchanged worried glances but decided not to press further that night. They were just relieved their son was safe.



### Chapter 3: The True Man of Marvel



The next morning, Elias woke up feeling different. Stronger. Faster. His senses were heightened to an almost impossible degree. He could hear conversations happening several blocks away. When he looked out the window, he could see the individual threads in people’s clothing from across the street.



Confused and slightly frightened, he stumbled into the living room, where his parents were having breakfast.



""Morning, sweetheart,"" Luna said, smiling as she poured herself some coffee. ""Feeling better?""



""I…I don’t know,"" Elias stammered. ""Something’s wrong with me.""



Sekou raised an eyebrow. ""What do you mean?""



Before Elias could answer, his hand twitched, and in an instant, the coffee mug Luna was holding flew out of her hand and into his. Both Sekou and Luna gasped as Elias stared at the mug, wide-eyed.



""How did you do that?"" Sekou asked, getting to his feet.



""I don’t know,"" Elias replied, his voice trembling. ""I don’t know what’s happening to me!""



Over the next few days, Elias began to exhibit more powers—super strength, the ability to fly, near invulnerability. It didn’t take long for him and his parents to realize that the strange rock he touched in the forest had somehow activated something within him, something tied to The Catalyst that had been affecting people all over the world.



Elias had become something more than human—he had become the Marvel Universe's answer to Superman. 



Realizing the potential for both good and danger, Elias decided to adopt a new moniker: \*\*Solarman\*\*—an homage to his mother’s love for the stars and the sun’s role in powering life on Earth. During the day, he continued his work as a budding reporter, quickly rising through the ranks to run one of the most successful newspapers in all of New York City. But when trouble called, he donned his hero disguise and flew into action as Solarman, protector of NYC.



### Chapter 4: A Hero Emerges



Word of Solarman’s heroics quickly spread. He became a beacon of hope in the city, saving lives, stopping criminals, and even preventing natural disasters. From stopping a collapsing building in Midtown Manhattan to thwarting a group of tech-enhanced mercenaries trying to rob a bank, Solarman became a household name.



But his double life was anything but easy. Running a successful newspaper by day while fighting crime by night put an enormous strain on Elias. He struggled to balance the responsibilities of both identities. Luna and Sekou, while proud of their son’s heroism, worried constantly about his safety.



""Are you sure you can keep doing this?"" Luna asked one night, after Elias had returned home from a particularly brutal battle with a group of villains known as \*The Iron Hands\*.



""I don’t have a choice, Mom,"" Elias replied, wiping the blood from his lip. ""People need me.""



""But you need rest too,"" Sekou said, his voice filled with concern. ""You can’t save everyone, Elias.""



Elias sighed, looking down at his hands. ""I know, Dad. But if I don’t try, who will?""



### Chapter 5: The Ultimate Test



As Elias continued to protect NYC, a new threat loomed on the horizon—one tied directly to The Catalyst. An ancient artifact, said to be the source of The Catalyst's power, had been unearthed, and a powerful villain named Vortex sought to claim it for himself. With the power of the artifact, Vortex planned to rewrite reality itself, turning New York—and the world—into his personal kingdom.



Knowing that he was the only one strong enough to stop Vortex, Elias prepared for the fight of his life. But this battle would push him to his limits, forcing him to confront not only Vortex but the dark truths about The Catalyst and its origins.



Would Solarman be able to protect the city he loved, or would the power of The Catalyst tear everything apart?
