I need advice on what the title suggests. 

I have a date planned with this girl I met on Hinge (F28) a few days ago. I‚Äôm currently on a 2 week vacation and we plan to meet up for the first time/have coffee once I return. 

She and I have a TON in common, and she‚Äôs super sweet, smart, caring, communicates well, etc. 

Neither of us are looking to jump straight into a relationship right away, we want to see how we like each other‚Äôs company first, then let a relationship develop naturally. 

My ex and I broke up almost 4-5 months ago, and we have been nothing but roommates since the breakup. She was supposed to move out way earlier, but she recently has been recovering from ankle surgery, after breaking it, so she‚Äôs been in an ankle/knee scooter for almost 2 months now. 

She‚Äôs informed me that 1) She‚Äôs already found a new place, 2) The only reason she hasn‚Äôt fully moved out of my house is that she doesn‚Äôt feel 100% physically comfortable yet, living alone given her ankle. 

Once she‚Äôs in a walking boot at the start of October, then she‚Äôll fully move out. 

I have ZERO intention of staying friends with her, once she moves out. I am 100% only a roommate to her now, she has her own room in the house, etc. 

How do I inform my new date of my current less than desirable living arrangement, I don‚Äôt want to lie/hide this from her, but I also don‚Äôt want this info to torpedo us getting to know one another? ",1,1756044523.0,dating,1,1.0,False

So, I match with this guy who seemed pretty normal online‚Äîdecent convo, kinda cute in his pics, ya know the dtill. We decide to meet up at this cozy little coffee shop where they do those awesome lattte art desiggns. I was feeling optimistic. 

So he arrivfs, and I notice within the fiirst five minutes, dude has this habit of snaoping his fingers. Like, CONSTANTLY. I thought maybe he was excited or had a catchy song stuck in his head or something, but nope. We‚Äôre talking about our favorite TV shows: *snap*. Discussing the best kind of pizza: *snap snap*. I‚Äôm like, is this a nervous tick or a secret musival rehearsal? üòÇ 

At first, I tried to ignore it, but as the date went on, it was like I was in some weird beatboxing performance where I missed the memo. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Now, I‚Äôm all for being quirky. I mean, I laugh-snrot when I find someting super funny, but this was next level, lol. He didn‚Äôt even seem to realize he was doing it! 

Gotta say thouugh, aside from the finger-snapping symphony, he was pretty sweet. Maybe it's his way of adding a soundtrack to life? Before I knew it, we were exchanging notes on our favorite figner foods... fitting, right? 

Who knows if I‚Äôll see him again, but at least I‚Äôll forever have this biarre mental image of a mini jazz concert in a coffee shop. Next time, maybe I‚Äôll suggest a palce with more backgriund noise. ü§î",1,1756044515.0,OnlineDatingStory,0,1.0,False

1mywhzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1mywhzz/the_tale_of_two_frustrating_experiences_i_think_i/,The Tale of Two Frustrating Experiences ‚Äì I Think I Am Done,"So after a year of trying to find a potential AP, I feel like I am living in some kind of cosmic joke. Two men, two totally opposite situations, and both left me wondering if the universe is trolling me. I posted a couple weeks ago about man number 1‚Ä¶.

Act 1: The Over Eager Romeo
This guy came in HOT. We met for coffee and shared two kisses. He instantly went full rom com monologue: ‚ÄúI want to marry you, run away with you, leave my wife, I cannot stop thinking about you.‚Äù He wanted to see me the very next day, was making huge promises, and practically had us moving to a cabin in the woods by week two. It was so over the top that all my red flag alarms went off. I blocked him and ran. No way am I signing up for that drama.

Act 2: The Cold Footed Casanova
Fast forward to this week. Another man I had been chatting with for about 7 or 8 months. Younger, fun, seemed to have some potential. Lots of spicy conversations, promises of super intense chemistry. I thought, ‚ÄúOkay, finally.‚Äù I book a trip to see him in his city.

What happens? NOTHING. And I mean nothing. The man kissed me like he wanted to devour me, long movie scene make out sessions, 40 or 50 minutes straight in bed, some touching, but when it came to actually following through? Freeze frame. Total stop. I tried to give him a blow job‚Ä¶ he sat there like that a dead fish and I couldn‚Äôt know if he even enjoyed. I stopped because nothing was fucking. 
There is even a scene burned in my brain: he goes to grab a condom, I am thinking, ‚ÄúFinally.‚Äù Then he literally stops halfway and says, ‚Äúlater.‚Äù I actually asked him, ‚ÄúWhat the actual fuck? Are you not attracted to me?‚Äù He said he was very attracted to me. He said our kisses were the best he has ever had. And then nothing. Quiet. Awkward. Like the make out mute button got hit every time things were about to happen.

For context, he told me it was his first time traveling with a woman, first time in a hotel room with one, and honestly, it showed. Sweet but awkward. Two nights, not one step further than kissing and some heavy touching. I could not wait to get out of there.

So here I am, after a year, with two extremes:
	‚Ä¢	One man ready to burn down his life for me after a coffee and two kisses.
	‚Ä¢	Another who freezes mid kiss and mid condom grab like a deer in headlights.

I am tired, annoyed, puzzled, and honestly thinking maybe this whole AP adventure is just not meant for me.",1,1756044398.0,adultery,1,1.0,False

1mywhh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mywhh8/looking_for_recommendations_for_a_new_grinder_400/,Looking for recommendations for a new grinder [$400],"TLDR: Need a decent electric burr grinder. Considering a fellow opus, but also maybe just going for a df64. Open to suggestions as I am fairly new to coffee.

So, I am fairly new to coffee. Never drank it as I grew up in a home where no one drank it. But, I have suffered from migraines since I was a child. I thought for years, however, that they were just horrible headaches and that aspirin is useless.

Long story short: they weren‚Äôt headaches and aspirin doesn‚Äôt work on migraines, but I found out that espressos do. So, I decided to get a home setup so that I could save myself a day of agony the next time a migraine came on. So, far it has been working well and 100% worth the investment.

Here‚Äôs my problem: I really like espressos now and I am kinda getting into coffee in general. It‚Äôs growing into a hobby. It‚Äôs so fun and delicious. But, I am still green. When I first bought my setup I didn‚Äôt know much and did minimal research because for what I needed I felt like anything should work. I decided to get something that would be as automated as possible, but still deliver an actual espresso that way I could reasonably get it done even when I had a migraine.

So, I ended up with a Breville (Sage) Bambino Plus and a Breville Smart Grinder Pro.

For my purposes now and where I am in terms of my knowledge I feel like my Bambino is acceptable, though I do have plans of upgrading it eventually. But, I am so over this Smart Grinder Pro. It is just‚Ä¶no. I am getting much better results with literally every other grinder I have ever used.

# Mark 10:37

* They replied, ‚ÄúLet one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.‚Äù

When we ask to be near Christ and to honor Him, we often don‚Äôt realize what we‚Äôre asking for.

James and John were sincere in their love for Jesus and their desire to be part of His kingdom, but they misunderstood the nature of that kingdom. They were thinking in earthly terms, seeking positions of power. Still, when Jesus asked if they were ready to pay the price, they answered sincerely.

They said, ‚ÄúWe are able,‚Äù and they proved it. As they later learned the true meaning of the kingdom, they didn‚Äôt waver but accepted the cup of suffering and the baptism of sacrifice.

When we devote ourselves to Christ, we often think only of the joy and satisfaction that comes with following Him. We declare our readiness without fully knowing what we‚Äôre committing to. But we need not hesitate.

Anything we sacrifice or suffer for Christ will be worth it in the end‚Äîit will bring us glory.",1,1756044120.0,EnlightenUp,0,1.0,False

1mywbov,https://www.reddit.com/r/india_tourism/comments/1mywbov/travel_blog_exploring_goa_in_june_by_aarav_kumar/,Travel Blog: Exploring Goa in June ‚Äî By Aarav Kumar Pandey,"Welcome back, fellow travelers! This is Aarav Kumar Pandey, taking you on a unique adventure to Goa in the month of June‚Äîa time when the monsoon breathes new life into this stunning destination. If you think Goa is only about beaches and parties, let me show you a different side that's calm, lush, and deeply local.

# Why June? The Magic of Monsoon in Goa

June in Goa marks the start of the monsoon season. The temperature drops to a pleasant average of 30¬∞C, and everything‚Äîfrom beaches to forests‚Äîbursts into vibrant green. Yes, there‚Äôs rain (about 22 days out of the month), but it‚Äôs not just about getting wet‚Äîit's about experiencing Goa at its most serene, away from the crowds and at unbeatable prices. Fewer tourists mean quieter beaches, deserted southern shores, and local experiences you won‚Äôt get in the high season. You‚Äôll be able to book premium stays for much cheaper, and enjoy local hospitality at its finest.

# What You Can Do in Goa in June

1. **Waterfall Treks & Nature Escapes**
   * Visit the Dudhsagar Falls, which are in full flow during the monsoons‚Äîperfect for photos, picnics, and a bit of adventure. You can also trek to hidden gems like Tambdi Surla Waterfall and Butterfly Beach for those who love offbeat experiences.
2. **Monsoon Festivals & Heritage Walks**
   * Experience the S√£o Jo√£o festival, where locals celebrate with rain dances and colorful costumes. Join guided heritage walks through Fontainhas, Old Goa, or the villages‚Äîit‚Äôs a cultural immersion you won‚Äôt forget.
3. **Wildlife & Birdwatching**
   * Explore the Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary and spot rare species. The fresh monsoon air and swollen rivers make for a beautiful, quiet escape from the beach.
4. **Adventure Sports**
   * While standard water sports may be closed, you can enjoy kayaking in the rivers, cycling through rain-kissed routes, and even try white-water rafting if you crave thrill.
5. **Local Eats & Culinary Experiences**
   * Enjoy a food tour of Goan kitchens. With fewer tourists, you‚Äôll find authentic restaurants eager to serve their best. Try monsoon fish specialties and hot chai by the beach while watching dramatic skies.
6. **Spa & Wellness Days**
   * Monsoon is ideal for slowing down‚Äîa spa day is just what you need to complement all that adventure. Find wellness retreats offering rejuvenating treatments for less than peak prices.

# What‚Äôs Different? Beaches, Shacks, and Parties

* North Goa beaches like Baga, Candolim, Calangute, and Anjuna remain lively, but much quieter. South Goa is nearly empty‚Äîideal for those seeking solitude.
* Expect fewer parties, but some clubs host monsoon-themed events. Most shacks are closed, but permanent ones in North Goa still operate.
* Swimming in the sea can be risky due to strong waves‚Äîstick to walks, sunsets, and beachside caf√©s.

# Tips & Essentials for a June Trip

* Pack light rain gear, waterproof bags, and comfortable shoes for trekking.
* Book accommodations with sheltered spaces (verandas, balconies) to enjoy rain views.
* Sample Goan monsoon cuisine‚Äîspicy, warming, and full of seasonal flavors.
* Don‚Äôt stress about the rain: sudden downpours often clear up quickly, leaving hours for exploration.

# My Experience and Final Thoughts

Goa in June offered a refreshing break from the classic high-season chaos. Sipping coffee as rain fell over the Arabian Sea, walking through empty streets, and joining lively local festivals made it a trip I‚Äôll never forget. If you want to discover Goa‚Äôs hidden, romantic, and authentic side, June is your month.

So what are you waiting for? Put away your umbrella‚Äîlet‚Äôs embrace the monsoon magic of Goa together. For more travel stories and practical guides, stay tuned and join me on my next adventure!

I wanted to share my thoughts with you all, in case you're pondering your next read.

**A Quick Look (No Spoilers, I Promise!)**

This story introduces us to Nora, a successful surgeon with a dark secret from her past. As a child, her father was arrested for being a serial killer, and Nora was the one who found the evidence behind a locked door. Now, years later, a new series of murders begins, eerily similar to her father's crimes. This forces Nora to confront the chilling possibility that the past isn't as buried as she thought, and the truth about her father‚Äîand herself‚Äîmight be far more complicated and terrifying. It‚Äôs a classic psychological thriller setup that kept me guessing.

**What Really Stood Out For Me**

First off, the **pacing** in this book is just phenomenal. Freida McFadden is known for her fast-paced, unputdownable style, and *The Locked Door* is no exception. It's like a rollercoaster ride where every chapter leaves you wanting to know what happens next. I found myself devouring pages late into the night, promising myself ""just one more chapter"" only to find an hour had passed!

The **twists and turns** are another highlight. Just when you think you've figured things out, McFadden throws another curveball your way. There were moments where I literally gasped out loud, and that's always a sign of a good thriller, isn't it? The way she builds suspense and then delivers a shocking revelation is incredibly well done. Her **writing style** is very straightforward and engaging, which makes for a super accessible read. You won't find yourself struggling with overly complex language; it's just pure, compelling storytelling.

**A Balanced Perspective**

While I absolutely loved the thrill ride, I will say that some of the **characters**, aside from Nora, felt a little less developed at times. However, for a thriller of this nature, the focus is really on the plot and the suspense, and in that regard, it absolutely delivers. You might not form deep emotional connections with every supporting character, but Nora's journey and her internal struggle are compelling enough to carry the story. If you're looking for deep literary analysis, this might not be your pick, but if you're after a gripping plot, you're in for a treat.

**Would I Recommend It? And For Whom?**

Absolutely, yes! If you are a fan of psychological thrillers, suspense, or mysteries that keep you on the edge of your seat, then you should definitely pick up *The Locked Door*. It‚Äôs perfect for readers who love a good puzzle and enjoy trying to predict the outcome (and usually failing!). If you've enjoyed other books by Freida McFadden, or authors like Colleen Hoover (though this is more thriller) or anything that promises a big twist, you‚Äôll likely love this. Even if thrillers aren't your usual genre (perhaps you're a fantasy reader curious about dipping your toes into suspense), this is a fantastic and accessible entry point. If this sounds like something you'd enjoy, you can learn more about [The Locked Door By Freida McFadden](https://pdfhive.com/the-locked-door-by-freida-mcfadden/) and see if it's your next read.

**A Little Encouragement for New Readers!**

For those of you who are just starting your reading journey, especially with books that can be as intense as thrillers, here are a few friendly tips:

*   **Step 1: Start with What You Love.** Don't feel pressured to read certain ""classic"" books if they don't interest you. Pick a genre that excites you, whether it's thrillers, fantasy, romance, or something else entirely. Reading should be enjoyable!
*   **Step 2: It's Okay to Put a Book Down.** If a book isn't grabbing you after a few chapters, don't feel guilty about moving on. Life's too short to read books you don't enjoy. There are millions of stories out there waiting for you.
*   **Step 3: Little Bits Add Up.** You don't need to read for hours every day. Even 15-20 minutes during your commute, before bed, or with your morning coffee can make a huge difference. Consistency is key!
*   **Step 4: Find Your Perfect Reading Spot.** Create a cozy corner, grab a warm drink, and make reading a relaxing ritual.
*   **Step 5: Audiobooks Count!** If traditional reading isn't always possible, try audiobooks! They're fantastic for multitasking and still let you dive into amazing stories.

Reading is a wonderful adventure that opens up new worlds and perspectives. Don't worry about how fast or how much you read; just enjoy the process. Every book you finish is an accomplishment, and every page you turn is a step into a new story.

So, if you're in the mood for a heart-pounding, twisty ride that will keep you guessing until the very end, I highly recommend giving *The Locked Door* a try. It‚Äôs a truly gripping read that will stay with you long after you've turned the final page. And if you're ready to dive in, you can often find your next great read, like [The Locked Door By Freida McFadden](https://pdfhive.com/the-locked-door-by-freida-mcfadden/), through various online resources.

I got the 078 to taste the flavor separation that is mentioned so often here. I seasoned the 078 with over 10 lbs of beans, and have been using it for several weeks. I still feel as if I'm getting more sort of coffee tasting coffee than I was with the Ode 2. Full disclosure,  I'm using too many different coffees, and applying insufficient discipline, and trying different pouring techniques, but my overall impression is ""not tasting it"". I'd like to know if the 078 needs more seasoning, or I'm not grinding fine enough, or if I just should have put the SSP burrs on the Ode.

I recognize that this is a bit of desperation, but our toddler broke our old Coffee Cup from Slave to the Grind in Bronxville. We got ours back when we were grad students around ~2013 (we met in school). I know it probably doesn‚Äôt seem like a big deal, but it‚Äôs a favorite of ours and I love serving my wife some tea of coffee in it with a story from our school years to make her smile. Slave to the grind switched to apparel for merch a while back and haven‚Äôt offered the mugs in years (at least 3 according to the employee I spoke to). All of which brings me to the question: Is anyone interested in selling me an old coffee mug?  Happy to pay for it + shipping. 

Also, I know it‚Äôs a complete long shot that someone will see this, have a 5+ year old mug, and be willing to part with it themselves, but I don‚Äôt have any better ideas so here I am. Thanks for reading and parents, follow that instinct to take the breakable thing that can‚Äôt be replaced away from the toddler even if you know she‚Äôs gonna cry about it.

Now the problem starts here, ik myself and I‚Äôm wayy too much possessive and a little insecure (especially about female best friends, my 1st bf ghosted me and I heard from a friend that he was with his best friend whom he told me not to worry about anyways). I started noticing that my ex (2nd boyfriend) is really close to many girls, but I didn‚Äôt want to get this between our relationship so I was suppressing my insecurity. At first he started going cycling with my best friend in the morning (I was away from home for the 1st year of relationship due to personal reasons). At first it did bother me but I never said anything, because I did trust them, but after some time, he started being on call with a girl friend of his (regularly) who has had a crush on him since 5 years and he knows that. Whenever my classes were over I was so happy that I‚Äôd call him but his call every day was busy and he came about 15 min later. He never lied about being on call or anything, but still, and they used to be on call for about 1‚Äì2 hours daily. It bothered me and I asked him to reduce the amount of time on call, he got really angry but he actually did stop doing that, tho he was pissed. Then after some time a friend group formed in his school of him with 1 another boy and 3 girls. Now, one of the girls was a really big asshole and playgirl, I knew her, and I told him that but he literally fought with me for her (they became friends literally 1‚Äì2 weeks ago maximum, and we‚Äôd been in this relationship for about 9‚Äì10 months), but he didn‚Äôt listen to me and kept fighting that she‚Äôs a good girl etc etc. I stopped saying anything, he even made me go out with him and that group of his (I hate myself for going). A while later, it happened ‚Äî those friends of his started being mean to him as I told him they would, and many things. He realised I was right and said sorry, but I was pissed, he literally fought with me for months for them. I said all of it, that he‚Äôs ready to fight with me for literally any girl. And then after some time we broke up, but ended up getting back together after 2 months. When we got back together I got to know that he started talking to 2 other girls (he was even texting me again and again during those 2 months when we had broken up) and 1 of those girls was again a fuckgirl, and he still talked to her, went in functions and to coffee with her. But the worst part was that he never told me any of it himself, I got to know this by a friend of his. He just told me that he started talking to a girl normally (it was romantically). And the other girl, they were still talking from the time me and him had broken up ‚Äî they started talking and they talked literally day and night, like we used to do. I‚Äôve seen the chats, and even when we got back together they used to chat like that, waking up and texting each other first, being on call late at nights, literally informing every detail to each other. I confronted him about it and he again fought with me, and I cut the call. After about 10 mins I called him back and his phone came busy (it was 3 am) and he was on call with that girl. I checked it, and he called me back, said that he‚Äôs talking to a friend and he‚Äôll call me back later. After about 20 mins he called and started lying to my face so fluently, about a made up story of his friend asking him about a dog he saw in college. I straight up said why did u lie, he burst out crying and said ""why did you check?"" And said that I didn‚Äôt trust him. And after that I stopped saying anything about any girl. He still talks to her. I broke up with him, he asked to get back together but I denied.

Did I do the right thing? I really loved him and wanted to be with him, I believe even he did because other than this he did everything right, he even put up with me when I treated him really badly for months, because of my anger towards him because of all of this.

Ik it‚Äôs not too late and if I try we can come back together.

But I don‚Äôt think I can handle it.

This year‚Äôs version is¬†*bigger and better*! And by bigger, I mean smaller, and by better, I actually do mean better. If you think it looks suspiciously like a manual coffee grinder, don‚Äôt be fooled! ‚Ä¶Well okay, it basically is, but with some key modifications to make it less grindy and more threshy.

Functionally, it‚Äôs simple: I add basil pods in the top, turn the finger crank, and out the bottom come seeds and husks. There‚Äôs some mechanical mumbo jumbo happening in between, but that‚Äôs not really important.

The big upgrade this year is an adjustment option! I can twist the top section to set the spacing between the inner and outer burrs. Too tight and I get aromatic seed powder, too loose and I‚Äôm just moving intact pods from top to bottom. However, once I found the right middle ground, the seeds separated cleanly and without damage.

¬†This also¬†*should*¬†make it usable for other seed types.... In theory‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a solid theory I promise, but I‚Äôm leaving the experimental confirmation of that to others if they are interested.

Next on my to do list is a trommel-style cleaner to separate seed from chaff. Last year I tried to combine threshing and cleaning in one tool, but it wasn‚Äôt very effective or adjustable. This time I‚Äôm making it a dedicated tool. Ideally it will be compact, adjustable for different seeds, and fully 3D printed. After that, I‚Äôll revisit my seed sorter. I built one last year that worked well, but it was big, tricky to print, and over complicated to operate.

You might reasonably ask, ‚ÄúWhy is any of this necessary?‚Äù And the obvious answer is that it‚Äôs not. But I relax and have fun designing and making things like this, and that‚Äôs reason enough for me.",2,1756043432.0,gardening,0,1.0,False

I've been meaning to get on this for a little over a year, now, and I figured now that it's done, sharing the layout may help others with their procrastination.

Food is a wonderful way to love on people, but food that might make them ill...not so much. When we were visiting another parish, they had allergen cards available for the potluck. Each person took a card and a dry erase marker, then marked the card to identify their dish, and set it in front of the dish. I snapped a picture (with permission) and asked if our parish might like to use something like that. They said yes, and then I wandered off (evidently - I'm not entirely sure what my problem was). But, the best time to plant a tree, and all that...

So, here it is. This is my second pass at creating a card, and it's not perfect, but it's a start. I tried to cover the most common concerns. You might want to curate it a bit to work for your community.

Instructions:

* Open the Google Doc, click on File > Make a copy, and save your own copy that you can then edit to fit the needs of your parish.
* Print the sheets, cut the cards out, and laminate (or, if you don't have a laminator, clear packing tape works like a charm).
* Splurge on a pack of **thin tip** dry erase markers and give them to your kitchen crew.

Unfortunately, the original box is huge, and it's a pain to bring it with you. It also requires that you use three different piece types that are functionally the same, but fit together in a special way, causing a massive mess on the table. I went on a mission to redesign it!

My version is 4 times smaller, the interchangeable pieces are all the same, and all the pieces are easy to handle - with parts to easily pick them up with two fingers. I also added a raised grid to stop the buildings from moving. The box doubles as the board, and it looks really nice in our living room. With this version, we play a lot more :)

""Good Evening, Weller""

He grinned, ""Well i'll be damned. I thought i'd never see you again""

""Its not like im going anywhere aint i?"" I took a folded out wanted poster and set it down on the table. ""You've seen this fella? Selt Hendrix""

Weller took the poster and look at it for a while. Finally gave a nod. ""Selt. Yeah i saw him not far from here. I saw Banana with 'em too. They Vanished soon after. Folks say Selt kidnapped the Poor guy. Bad news""

He leaned back, shaking his head. ""You tracking him? I dont think that's a good idea. Especially with him being a whole Genocidal Meniac. Hell, You give me any amount of money i still wouldnt go near him""

I folded the poster and slid it back in my coat pocket. 

""Yeah yeah, Whatever. Worse case scenario is what? I die? I dont have anything to lose.""

Weller look nervous, more concerned even. ""Well arent you going to Side with Those Rebellion folk? Seems like you have better odds with that.""

I pondered, Thought about it, he could be right. But that's not my style. ""I dont fit with them,  both in motive and in general.  They're Seasoned warriors with years of Experience and Supernatrual powers. And me? Well i'm just a wanderer with a Gun.""

1myvyed,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1myvyed/should_you_choose_pureline_plc904_coffee_filter/,Should You Choose Pureline PLC-904 Coffee Filter for Cuisinart Machines Review?,"The PURELINE PLC-904 Cuisinart Coffee Maker Water Filter is a product that I‚Äôve been testing for a few weeks now, and I can confidently say, it has left a mark on my daily coffee-making routine. Designed as a 12-pack replacement charcoal water filter, it‚Äôs compatible with all Cuisinart coffee machines. My goal was to see if these filters truly live up to their promise of improving coffee taste and prolonging the life of coffee machines. Let‚Äôs dive right into my experience.

**EXCEPTIONAL DESIGN AND COMPATIBILITY**  
One of the things that struck me right away is the thoughtful design of these water filters. They‚Äôre compact, lightweight at just 0.26 pounds, and fit snugly into my Cuisinart coffee maker with zero hassle. Sometimes, generic filters don‚Äôt quite click in place, which can be incredibly frustrating. With these, the fit was perfect. The packaging, too, clearly labeled each filter, making it easy to store and use without any mix-ups. Their compatibility with all Cuisinart models, whether I was using a smaller single-serving machine or a larger brewer for gatherings, made the transition incredibly simple.  

[Grab your PURELINE PLC-904 coffee filter bargain‚Äîsee Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08dbvyjpz/)  

**DOES IT REALLY IMPROVE COFFEE TASTE?**  
I‚Äôll admit, I was skeptical about how much of a difference the water filter could make. After all, my coffee was already decent. However, after the switch, I noticed an immediate improvement. The taste was cleaner, smoother, and fresher, as if a subtle bitterness had been stripped away. It honestly felt like my cups of coffee had been elevated to caf√©-level quality‚Äîsomething I now can‚Äôt do without. I shared a few cups with my co-workers during a late-night meeting, and without telling them I‚Äôd swapped the filter, all of them commented on how much nicer the coffee tasted. A win all around!  

**EFFORTLESS MAINTENANCE FOR YOUR MACHINE**  
One of the selling points of this product is its role in protecting your coffee maker by preventing impurities from building up and potentially causing damage. I‚Äôve had my coffee maker for years, and the last thing I want is a filter making promises it can‚Äôt keep. With these replacements, I feel more confident about the long-term performance of my brewer. After running 25-30 cups through the machine post-installation, there were no weird residues or reduced functionality, which usually happens when filters aren‚Äôt effective.  

**PRODUCT BENEFITS**  
- Enhances the flavor of coffee by removing unwanted contaminants from the water.  
- Ensures compatibility with all Cuisinart coffee machines, regardless of model.  
- Lightweight and convenient for storage and replacement.  

**MINUS POINTS**  
- Each filter is dated for reliability, but I did notice some slight inconsistencies in the charcoal density between a couple of the filters.  
- The packaging doesn‚Äôt include installation instructions, so if you‚Äôre new to coffee machine filters, you might need a quick online search.  
- Though it improves taste, it may not fully filter out hard water minerals that require a separate descaling regimen.  

**USER EXPERIENCE AND DRAWBACKS**  
While these coffee machine filters are effective, perfection wasn‚Äôt entirely achieved. One minor gripe I experienced was that one of the filters appeared to have a tiny charcoal excess upon unboxing, which required a rinse before use. Speaking of rinsing, anyone sensitive to basic maintenance tasks might find this an inconvenience. These are minor qualms, but worth noting for those particular about a ‚Äúno-fuss‚Äù coffee-making experience.  

**PRODUCT RIVALS IN THIS SPACE**  
Compared to other water filter replacements like the Aquacrest filters or Keurig charcoal options, PURELINE has a solid edge in compatibility and performance. Aquacrest, for instance, is sometimes hit-or-miss with Cuisinart machines, and their filters often last a shorter cycle. Keurig‚Äôs filters, while good, are priced slightly higher without much noticeable difference in water purification effects. What sets the PURELINE replacement apart is the combination of taste-enhancing features and its ability to prevent damage to coffee makers. Aquacrest struggles in this respect, with some users reporting machine clogs.  

**PRICE PERFORMANCE**  
Based on its sturdy performance, the slight boost in coffee quality, and user-friendliness, this product strikes a solid balance between price and quality. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest option on the market, the longevity and effectiveness of the filters make it a justifiable purchase for coffee enthusiasts. Unlike disposable options that often leave grounds unchecked, these filters ensure nothing but clean, crisp-tasting water flows through your coffee maker.

At my worst I had debilitating back pain, fatigue, brain fog, constipation, gerd, headaches, low libido etc.

Started with a low fodmap diet with some success but still couldn‚Äôt have regular bm‚Äôs, was still very bloated with constipation, burping, headaches and fatigue.

Did one round of xifaxin and neomycin, afterward I couldn‚Äôt tolerate any kind of dietary fiber or carbohydrates. I did the carnivore diet for almost two months. Symptoms somewhat subsided but I still didn‚Äôt have regular bm‚Äôs, etc. 

Started incorporating kimchi, kefir and making my own L reuteri yogurt. I also did a round of antranil with oregano oil, followed by dysbiocide and fc cidal plus berberine. (Berberine took my libido and ERASED it, so I‚Äôll never do that again lol)

I incorporated more fiber into my diet - veggies, nutritional yeast, rice, sorghum, chia seeds with good luck. I started taking digestive enzymes when I do eat, and artichoke ginger capsules and iberogast and my motility/bm‚Äôs are great. But I still have some sibo symptoms, especially when eating high fodmaps.

Recently did a round of flagyl and it definitely got my sibo stirred up. Heavy die off symptoms and for some reason for the ten days I was on it I was HUNGRY. It made my appetite really ramp up. Ate a lot of high fodmap foods to get the Sibo to react and kill it with the flagyl. 

Post flagyl, my stomach feels really sore. I‚Äôm still having some symptoms, so I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs going to keep getting better or if I still have Sibo. 

Confused now if I should do a 30 day carnivore diet of just water, beef, salt and butter - no coffee (I‚Äôve heard people have had good luck with this) and then reintroduce probiotics and fibrous veggies again or if I should just ask my doctor to do another round of flagyl in a few weeks. Until I decide I‚Äôm keeping with a low fodmap diet, high in fiber and protein and incorporating a lot of probiotics. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Now the problem starts here, ik myself and I‚Äôm wayy too much possessive and a little insecure (especially about female best friends, my 1st bf ghosted me and I heard from a friend that he was with his best friend whom he told me not to worry about anyways). I started noticing that my ex (2nd boyfriend) is really close to many girls, but I didn‚Äôt want to get this between our relationship so I was suppressing my insecurity. At first he started going cycling with my best friend in the morning (I was away from home for the 1st year of relationship due to personal reasons). At first it did bother me but I never said anything, because I did trust them, but after some time, he started being on call with a girl friend of his (regularly) who has had a crush on him since 5 years and he knows that. Whenever my classes were over I was so happy that I‚Äôd call him but his call every day was busy and he came about 15 min later. He never lied about being on call or anything, but still, and they used to be on call for about 1‚Äì2 hours daily. It bothered me and I asked him to reduce the amount of time on call, he got really angry but he actually did stop doing that, tho he was pissed. Then after some time a friend group formed in his school of him with 1 another boy and 3 girls. Now, one of the girls was a really big asshole and playgirl, I knew her, and I told him that but he literally fought with me for her (they became friends literally 1‚Äì2 weeks ago maximum, and we‚Äôd been in this relationship for about 9‚Äì10 months), but he didn‚Äôt listen to me and kept fighting that she‚Äôs a good girl etc etc. I stopped saying anything, he even made me go out with him and that group of his (I hate myself for going). A while later, it happened ‚Äî those friends of his started being mean to him as I told him they would, and many things. He realised I was right and said sorry, but I was pissed, he literally fought with me for months for them. I said all of it, that he‚Äôs ready to fight with me for literally any girl. And then after some time we broke up, but ended up getting back together after 2 months. When we got back together I got to know that he started talking to 2 other girls (he was even texting me again and again during those 2 months when we had broken up) and 1 of those girls was again a fuckgirl, and he still talked to her, went in functions and to coffee with her. But the worst part was that he never told me any of it himself, I got to know this by a friend of his. He just told me that he started talking to a girl normally (it was romantically). And the other girl, they were still talking from the time me and him had broken up ‚Äî they started talking and they talked literally day and night, like we used to do. I‚Äôve seen the chats, and even when we got back together they used to chat like that, waking up and texting each other first, being on call late at nights, literally informing every detail to each other. I confronted him about it and he again fought with me, and I cut the call. After about 10 mins I called him back and his phone came busy (it was 3 am) and he was on call with that girl. I checked it, and he called me back, said that he‚Äôs talking to a friend and he‚Äôll call me back later. After about 20 mins he called and started lying to my face so fluently, about a made up story of his friend asking him about a dog he saw in college. I straight up said why did u lie, he burst out crying and said ""why did you check?"" And said that I didn‚Äôt trust him. And after that I stopped saying anything about any girl. He still talks to her. I broke up with him, he asked to get back together but I denied.

I really loved him and wanted to be with him, I believe even he did because other than this he did everything right, he even put up with me when I treated him really badly for months, because of my anger towards him because of all of this.

Ik it‚Äôs not too late and if I try we can come back together.

But I don‚Äôt think I can handle it.

I would say it started working within hours. I ate breakfast right after the shot, a veggie and cheese omelette, and then had to force myself to eat lunch around 2pm. I was not hungry but knew I need some nutrition so had a small amount of yogurt with blueberries and some grapefruit juice.

I did not think it would work that quickly so I had made dinner reservations so I could have one last nice meal out. I was not hungry but I forced myself self to eat a little bit of the appetizer (burrata and tomato salad), steak frites, and pecan pie. I took most of my entree home and had just a few bites of the pie. I was stuffed!

Saturday morning I was not hungry. I had coffee, then around 12:30 I made myself eat, a grapefruit and a mini bagel. Around 4pm I actually felt hungry so I had a banana and a small glass of milk. I ate a fairly normal dinner of creamy tomato canellini beans with arugula and toasted sourdough bread and a small glass of chardonnay. Again I was stuffed full.

I am amazed at how quickly it worked. I thought it would take days to a week for the hunger to go away. I have experienced mild nausea and Friday night I did not sleep well.

I use the Flair PRO2 and today I used home-roasted Yirgacheffe washed Ethiopia. This coffee I roasted medium-light using the BOCABOCA500. 


Regardless bean choice I use the same process:

 Fill a gooseneck kettle with ISO water and heat to a rolling boil. Preheat brew head by placing it on top the kettle and covering with the rubber cap. Use the dosing funnel and brewer scale to measure a dose of 18g. Spritz beans with water and shake to evenly distribute the liquid. Add to the Fiorenzato Pietro grinder with M-modal burrs and grind on the 0.6 setting; tilt the grinder to slow feed. When the grinding is complete, dry the portafilter and add a paper filter at the bottom of the portafilter. Transfer the grounds to the portafilter and WDT. Perform 1 firm level tamp, about 30#, then add the dispersion screen. Carefully remove the brew head from the heat and attach firmly to the portafilter. Fill the chamber to the top (don't underfill). Attach the pressure guage and place on the main post. With a shot glass on the brewer scale beneath the portafilter preinfuse 0.7g at 2 bar, ramp up pressure to 8.5 bar, and maintain said pressure until 39g is in the cup. Stir before serving. 


With this recipe and puck prep I always get a shot time of about 45 seconds. Today I accidentally left out the paper filter and couldn't get above 6 bar and got 40g in <12 seconds. Brewing this twice, once with RDT and once without, results were indistinguishable from one another. Less body, little crema, and a more rounded sweetness.",1,1756042325.0,FlairEspresso,0,1.0,False
1myvnu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1myvnu2/how_to_grab_the_attention_of_the_bishop/,How to grab the attention of the bishop,"There was an interesting concersation recently about how to raise attention to issues in the Church. Fr. Mikhail made it clear thet the office of the bishop throws away 99% of complaints even without looking at them. And if people in the parish talk about it over coffee then they fall into the mortal sin of slander (Fr. Mikhail was telling people to abstain from Communion for participating in such conversation. So what can one do to raise a matter to the attention of the bishop?

A famous priest was recently defrocked in Romania. There are foreigh bishops supporting him so can't wait to see which one is willing to officially take him. Subdeacon Gregory, since you love snooping here maybe ROCOR can do it since they sent a relic of St John of Shanghai to him after he was defrocked.

Getting back on-track, this priest decided to take revenge by starting a campaign to point out ""deviant"" priests (with photos, videos and chat captures as proof) within each diocese of the country who are tolerated by the bishops. I have nothing against a homosexual serving as priest but you can imagine that the news exploded like wildfire in an Orthodox country and is a sight to behold.

The first diocese he targeted already made 2 public announcements in 2 days trying to put out the fire. They claimed that all clergy in question were immediately referred to the diocean court. The original claim was that the material was sent to the bishop months ago but no action was taken then. There is no proof one way or another, but it is highly unlikely that someone close enough to the people involved to get the proof would not have notified the bishop first.

I am curios to see how this will continue with the other diocese.

Maybe some people could see it as a bunch of tea puns coupled with a tiny bit of story, but I personally like that.

The plot was not bad: not complex by any stretch, but pretty entertaining. Wu opens a new tea shop in the city. Wu has another ""Ninja, there's something I haven't told you.."" (not really) but he accidentally mentions that there are untested magical teas, so the Ninja poke fun around trying different teas. There's also some competition for their shop in a coffee shop just accross the street.

Whether it‚Äôs for my morning pour-over coffee or an evening tea session, this sleek little kettle has been through quite the workout. Let me just say upfront‚Äîit‚Äôs not perfect, but it definitely has its charm.

**Design: Effortlessly Elegant and Functional**  
The first thing that caught my eye with this electric kettle was its design. The red finish is painted beautifully, making it a decorative element on my otherwise plain kitchen counter. Its compact size (9"" x 9"" x 9"") is deceptive because it still holds up to 32 ounces, enough for multiple cups of coffee or tea. While testing, the ergonomic handle design made pouring super easy, especially during those lazy mornings when the coordination just isn‚Äôt there yet. That said, the kettle can feel slightly warm to touch after boiling, which might be a concern for families with kids. No surprises that Chantal, a brand known for innovation, infused their classic elegance into this product.

**Performance and Pouring Precision**  
This is where the kettle truly shines. Designed with a slow-pour spout, it‚Äôs almost as if it was tailor-made for my pour-over coffee ritual. The spout doesn‚Äôt just gush out boiling water uncontrollably‚Äîit cools water slightly to the perfect brewing temperature of 205¬∞F. Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt expecting this level of control from what looked like a fairly simple electric kettle. However, I learned quickly that the flow rate might be too slow for people who just want a quick boil to make pasta and not coffee aficionados like me.

**Durable Materials and Safety Features**  
One highlight worth raving about is the kettle‚Äôs stainless steel interior. Fully free of plastic, this 18/8 stainless steel design offers peace of mind, especially when you think about how much wear and tear a kettle can go through over the years. And let‚Äôs not forget the boil-dry protection‚Äîsomething I unironically tested when I accidentally started the kettle without water one busy morning. It automatically shut off, preventing any damage, which I greatly appreciated. The auto-shutoff also adds an extra layer of safety, though I noticed it doesn‚Äôt beep or signal when the boiling is done. Minimalistic? Yes, but perhaps to a fault.

**Strengths**  
- Sleek red design that complements any modern kitchen decor  
- Slow-pour spout perfect for precision pouring in coffee brewing  
- Stainless steel interior ensures no harmful plastic touches the water  
- Compact and lightweight, making it easy to lift and store

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- No audible alert when the water has boiled  
- Pouring can feel too slow for non-coffee-making purposes  
- The exterior gets warm to the touch, which might be problematic for households with children  

**Ease of Use: A Cordless Wonder**  
Who doesn‚Äôt enjoy the ease of cordless appliances? The Chantal kettle can be placed on its base at any angle, making it almost foolproof. This feature came in especially handy since my countertop isn‚Äôt the most spacious: I didn‚Äôt have to fuss over aligning it perfectly every time I returned it. Plus, with its hand-wash-only requirement, you don‚Äôt have to worry about accidental dishwasher mishaps.

**Competing Products**  
While I‚Äôm impressed with this particular electric kettle, it does face stiff competition from other brands. For instance, the Fellow Stagg EKG boasts a similar pour-over precision but offers additional temperature controls, something the Chantal Mia Electric Kettle lacks entirely. On the other hand, your typical budget-friendly kettles like the Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle get the job done quickly if you don‚Äôt care about the pour-over niceties. Compared to these options, Chantal‚Äôs Mia Electric Kettle delivers on aesthetics and functionality better than most but misses out on features like variable temperature control that coffee connoisseurs might crave.

**Value for Money**  
Considering its combination of functionality and premium design, the price point is justifiable but teeters towards the higher end for a product without advanced temperature controls. While you can find cheaper electric kettles in the market, you might sacrifice safety features or the plastic-free interior that Chantal provides. Ultimately, this kettle might not be appealing to everyone‚Äôs budget, but for those who appreciate a balance of aesthetics and utility, it‚Äôs a smart investment.

This is a pick from The Den (https://www.instagram.com/thedendfwbourbonclub?igsh=MTdyZGx1N29jZmpqcQ%3D%3D&utm_source=qr) who frequently picks bangers.

Nose: 
I have to say, this is the perfectly named pour.  The nose of this really is a chocolate croissant.  Minimal to non-existent ethanol burn.  It is a full nose and doesn't leave you wondering what you're about to try.  Heavy note of chocolate, on top of the right amount of oak, plus a hint of espresso.  Vanilla and baking spices make an appearance here as well.  

Palate: 
Just the right amount of oak and vanilla, before a hint of espresso and a tasteful wave of dark chocolate and a hint of spice.  Not thin, but not a flavor bomb, but it hits a sweet spot in the middle.  

Finish: 
This is a medium finish, and the dark chocolate on the palate sweets up into a lingering chocolate milk with a hint of espresso and spice that leaves you wanting more.    

Overall: 
Chocolate Croissant nails it.  Think about eating a chocolate croissant next to a cup of espresso in a bakery of fresh pastries.  That's it.  It reminds me of the OG location of Village Baking Co at Knox Henderson before they moved.  If you're afraid of a thin pour, have no fear here.  This is a really tasty and tasteful finish.  This isn't a dessert one-and-done pour like a Penelope Havana.  Multiple pours of this aren't off the table.  Just to make sure I wasn't off my rocker with the coffee, I had to take a sip of a coffee whiskey (King's County) after I finished.  This Makers has a hint of coffee but it is predominantly chocolate.

He also tried quitting smoking 3 months before surgery and lasted 1 month.

When we went to urologist for confirming, he found **grade 2 on the right side too**, although much smaller, and advised us to have ***bilateral microsurgery***. I'll tell you the experience from the beginning to end.  
  
**State before microsurgery (after 1 year of improvements for TTC):**

1.  30 yo
2. Mostly sedentary lifestyle, no workout
3. Smokes cigarettes 10-15 per day
4. Alcohol rarely - 1-3 times a month, a glass of wine or 1 beer per time
5. BMI 24.2, no weight issues
6. Male factor infertility(oligoastenoteratozoospermia)
7. DNA fragmentation - 16%
8. Slight pain from time to time on the right side after lifting heavy things, didn't pay much attention
9. Smaller testicles than normal
10. Low libido
11. Bad circadian rhythm, goes to bed 3-4AM, wakes up 10-11am, generally sleeps well
12. Eats well, very little processed food, but no breakfasts. Moderate(maybe slightly high) sugar intake - ice creams, coffee and tea with sugar, sometimes 1-2 homemade desserts a day.

**Supplements for 3 months before surgery**:

1. Ubiquinol 200mg
2. L-Carnitine 1000
3. Vit C 1000
4. Zinc 25(every other day before bed)
5. Vit D 2500 IU(every other day)

**Last 2 sperm tests before surgery(after quitting smoking for 1 month, dates 25.03 and 05.04):** 

* **Count**: 32.4 mil, 75mil
* **Concentration:** 9mil, 15 mil
* **Progressive motility**: 29%, 13%
* **Overall motility**: 56%, 40%
* **Morphology:** 2%, 3%

**Surgery**  
It took a lot of mental strength for him to finally decide to go for surgery. First we decided for local anesthesia, but in the operating room he asked for general anesthesia due to high levels of anxiety and stress. He didn't regret, surgery went smoothly for 3.5-4 hours, there were a lot of veins to take care of. They usually keep you one day in the hospital. He was able to slowly walk 2-3 hours after being in the room and went to bathroom by himself.

**Recovery**  
Recovery went smoother than we expected. The next day he was home, mostly lying down or sitting and slowly walking in the house. They put painkillers in him intravenously before discharging him that morning and after that he didn't even need to take painkillers at all. The pain was dull and only became sharp when trying to move in a way that puts pressure on the abdomen. In 3-4 days, he had almost no pain without pressuring the abdomen and just lying. We changed the bandages 2 times a day, the surgery incisions were healing slowly but progress was good. He resumed masturbation on the 9th day, and first time had sex on the 13th day without issues.  
On 10th day he went to get his stitches removed and the pain started to recede exponentially. He said that most of the pain came from stitches that were dragging the skin when moving. On the 15th day we went for a trip on a 4.5 hour flight, for a week. He was able to lift not-so heavy luggages several times, 8-10kg, and was able to swim in the sea with no pain. He basically returned to his daily activities without any heavy lifting in 15 days. In 3 months, he was the same person as he was before, including lifting weights during house chores(we were doing renovations).

**Fertility and libido improvements**  
His morning erections did noticeably improve a month after the surgery, he was getting them more often than before. His palpable veins disappeared, and it seems that the libido got a liiiitle bit higher. He never had testosterone issues, all hormones were normal all along, although some on the lower side of normal. We waited 3 months to do the first sperm test. And it came back worse than we imagined.  
  
**State 3 months after microsurgery:**

1.  30yo 
2. Mostly sedentary, added 30min to 1 hour walks every day
3. Never stopped smoking after surgery, 10-15 cigarettes a day(doesn't believe it worsens his chances:(( )
4. Alcohol - rarely
5. BMI 23.5, no weight issues
6. Male factor infertility(oligoastenozoospermia)
7. DNA fragmentation - did not check yet, plan to do it on 6 month mark
8. No pain in the testicles at all, all disappeared
9. Testicle size stayed the same
10. Libido slightly higher
11. Still Bad circadian rhythm, goes to bed 3-4AM
12. Eats well, started adding breakfasts several days a week. Lowering sugar intake a bit, let's see how it will go.

**Supplements for 3 months after surgery**:

1. Ubiquinol 200mg
2. L-Carnitine 1000
3. Omega 3 with DHA, 2000 (every 3 days)
4. Zinc 25(every other day before bed)
5. Vit D 2500 IU
6. Vit E 200

**Sperm test 3 months after surgery:** 

* **Count**: 32.2mil
* **Concentration:** 7mil
* **Progressive motility**: 1%
* **Overall motility**: 9%
* **Morphology:** 5%(first time seeing a number in normal range in his test)

We were not happy to see those results, but we've heard that sometimes it gets worse in 3 months, and skyrockets in 6-9 months after surgery. Overall, we are trying to remain hopeful that this will be the case with us, but I think he also needs to quit smoking completely to make this happen. Please share your similar stories if you were able to see improvements in sperm after surgery without quitting smoking. 

I hope this helps. I wanted to make this post as people who shared their experiences here helped us a lot to get ready for the surgery. Thank you!

Will update here in 3 months and will be happy to answer all of your questions.

TL;DR 3 months after bilateral microsurgery pain was gone, libido improved slightly, but sperm parameters got worse except morphology, which got a lot better. Didn't quit smoking, still taking supplements.",1,1756041672.0,varicocele,2,1.0,False

Alt text: Professional business meeting in Bahrain Financial Harbour with corporate professionals.](https://www.forbes.com/business/) and Reuters, the kingdom‚Äôs GDP surged by 4.6% in Q1 2025, outpacing regional rivals. New reforms have streamlined foreign investment: 99% foreign ownership is now standard in most sectors (source), with ease-of-business scores at an all-time high.\
\
Over 70% of new companies formed in 2024-2025 were foreign-owned.\
Bahrain Bay and Seef District are popular for tech startups and professional services.\
Free zones offer corporate tax exemptions and simplified hiring (more info).\
\
Importantly, as regulations have evolved, so have expectations for hiring. The Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) rolled out digital approval systems this March. The result: average work visa processing times dropped 30%. But even with these upgrades, the paperwork maze remains daunting‚Äîunless you know the shortcuts.\
Bahrain vs. Neighbours: Why the Kingdom Wins\
A fellow founder once said, ‚ÄúSetting up in Bahrain took weeks‚Äîmy friends in Dubai waited months.‚Äù In Saudi Arabia, mandatory local sponsorships, stricter Saudization quotas, and Ramadan business-hour slowdowns drag out the process. Bahrain? It‚Äôs faster, less bureaucratic, with real walk-in access to government offices (MOICT, LMRA, EDB) in the Diplomatic Area.\
But, and this is critical, Bahrain‚Äôs willingness to innovate brings constant regulatory tweaks. Staying current is non-negotiable.\

\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in a Bahrain office meeting., B.S.C. (Closed Joint Stock Company), or a branch of a foreign company**. Each offers unique pros:\
\
W.L.L.: Fastest setup, no minimum capital, great for consulting and trading.\
B.S.C.(Closed): Needed for large investments, banking/finance, or IPO ambitions.\
Foreign Branch: Useful if your HQ is abroad and you want full control.\
\
Read more on Bahrain business structure options.\
Insider Tip:\
\
Avoid sole proprietorships; they limit foreign hiring.\
Free zones allow full foreign control and easy hiring (details).\
\
\
Personal note: I once tried registering a consultancy as a sole proprietorship‚Äîonly to find out I couldn‚Äôt sponsor a single expat. Lesson learned: always map your hiring needs before choosing your company type.\
\
Recent 2025 Regulatory Update\
As of May 2025, the LMRA now requires an additional Beneficial Ownership Declaration for all corporate hires, part of Bahrain‚Äôs ongoing anti-money laundering push (Reuters: ""Bahrain Tightens AML Rules"", March 2025). Not submitting this form delays your work visa by 2-3 weeks, so prepare it in advance.\
Surprisingly, the update also allows digital signatures for this form, saving days of paper-chasing.\
100% Foreign Ownership: Real or Hype?\
Yes, it‚Äôs real for almost all business activities (proof here), except some restricted sectors (like defense, oil exploration, and select media).\
Check the full activity list before you register.\
Step-By-Step: How to Hire Foreign Employees in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation workflow in a Bahrain office.).\
- Register your company via Sijilat portal or at MOICT, Diplomatic Area.\
    - Required docs: Lease agreement (with Ejari certificate), Articles of Association, passport copies, commercial activity approval.\
- Commercial Registration (CR): Critical step‚Äîno CR, no employees. Get details here.\
Time-saving hack: Go early (8-9 am) to MOICT before the lunchtime rush. Ramadan? Double-check adjusted hours; I once missed a crucial stamp by arriving after midday prayers.\
2. Office and Address Requirements\
\
Need a physical office? Yes. Virtual offices are not valid for visa quotas. Business centers in Seef or Bahrain Bay can help if you don‚Äôt want to lease a private space.\
Best location tip: Seef District business centers process tenancy contracts fastest. Waiting until you sign a lease in Adliya or Budaiya could delay your CR approval by up to a week.\
\
3. Applying for LMRA Work Visas\
Documents Required:\
\
Valid CR (Commercial Registration)\
Passport copy (employee must have at least 2-year validity)\
Academic/professional certificates (attested‚Äîdo this BEFORE arrival)\
Medical clearance\
Latest company bank statement\
Insurance certificate (Now required as of Jan 2025)\
\
\
Short-cut: Pre-scan all documents as high-quality PDFs. The LMRA accepts digital uploads, and missing scans mean repeat trips (personal headache #1 for me).\
\
Application Process\
\
Submit online via LMRA portal.\
Pay fees (see next section for cost breakdown).\
Undergo vetting: LMRA checks quotas, company health, and labor compliance.\
\
Most approvals are now electronic. But if flagged for review, expect a call to visit LMRA, typically in the Diplomatic Area. Bring all originals, and prepare for a majlis-style meeting‚Äîbusiness conducted over Arabic coffee is a subtle but important custom.\
Pro Tips\
\
Apply for multiple visas at once‚Äîbatch applications save both money and approval time.\
Timing: Best months are September‚ÄìApril; avoid July‚ÄìAugust (summer slowdowns, less staff).\
Residence permit processing: Now bundled digitally, but pick up the physical card at the Nationality, Passports & Residence Affairs (NPRA) office, just behind Bahrain City Centre.\
\
4. Quota and Bahrainisation: The 2025 Realities\
New rules (as of February 2025) require a Bahrainisation ratio of just 5% for most sectors‚Äîdown from the previous 10%. This means you only need to employ one local Bahraini for every 19 foreign hires in non-restricted fields.\
Exception: Certain fields (banking, insurance, government contracting) require up to 30% Bahrainisation‚Äîdouble-check with the LMRA or a consultant first.\
5. After Visa Approval: Medical and Registration\
\
Medical check (can be done at Al Razi Clinic or International Hospital, both near Seef)\
Residence permit stamping at NPRA\
Register employee for GOSI (social insurance)\
Open local bank account\
\
One quirky detail: During Ramadan, public offices close early, and there‚Äôs usually complimentary dates and Arabic coffee offered in the waiting area‚Äîdon‚Äôt decline, it‚Äôs a subtle networking opportunity.\
Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Bahrain Work Visas in 2025\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain work visas.\
\
LMRA Work Visa Application: BHD 110‚Äì150 per employee (one-time)\
Residence Permit: BHD 72‚Äì100 per year\
Medical Tests: BHD 40‚Äì60\
Health Insurance: From BHD 100 per policy (mandatory since Jan 2025)\
Company Registration Fees: BHD 150‚Äì400 (depending on activity and structure)\
Office Lease: Business center desks can be found for BHD 150‚Äì250/month in Seef or Bahrain Bay\
\
Detailed fee calculator here.\
Budget Range: Minimum Setup for 1 Foreign Employee\
Total initial outlay: from BHD 500‚Äì800 (not including office rental). Larger teams scale cost per employee, but batch applications can reduce some official fees.\
Money-Saving Insider Tip: Register during Tamkeen or EDB promotional periods to get rebates on first-year visa fees; last year, Tamkeen covered up to 25% of startup costs for select tech businesses. Check Tamkeen.bh for periodic offers.\
A personal blunder: I once budgeted with an outdated fee schedule from 2023; an unplanned insurance premium nearly derailed hiring for two months. Always confirm the latest numbers and factor in 10% contingency.\
Legal Compliance and Post-Formation Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation audit in Bahrain office.. Fines for non-compliance start at BHD 250/month.\
- Annual LMRA Fee: BHD 72 per expat employee.\
- Accounting/bookkeeping: Appoint an approved firm; here‚Äôs a top-rated provider.\
- Bahrainisation Monitoring: Regular audits by LMRA; keep employment records updated.\
Mistake Alert:\
Many entrepreneurs forget to renew CR or miss annual LMRA fee deadlines‚Äîrisking suspension of all visas. My fix? I set two calendar reminders, synced with MOICT‚Äôs renewal email alerts.\
Document Shortcuts\
\
Prepare all certificates (education, experience) attested before arrival; retroactive attestation is slow and costly.\
Keep a folder of digital + print copies‚Äîoffices still request hard copies, especially during random audits.\
\
Professional Support and the Value of Local Networks\
\
Alt text: Professional business support and consultation in Bahrain.‚Äîthey navigate Sijilat, LMRA, MOICT, GOSI, and Tamkeen with inside contacts and deep cultural savvy. I avoided two weeks of back-and-forth when a consultant friend personally escorted my documents to the correct window (true story; saved me from a three-day queue during a government audit blitz).\
Majlis-style meetings are common for big deals‚Äîexpect to discuss business over gahwa (Arabic coffee) and dates. Accepting the invitation signals respect; declining can subtly stall your paperwork.\
During Ramadan, business slows mid-afternoon. Adjust your expectations and push any urgent submissions to morning hours.\
Comparison: Bahrain vs. UAE/Saudi\
\
No obligatory local sponsor (unlike Saudi/UAE mainland)\
Faster digital processing of visas and CRs\
Lower minimum capital requirements\
Easier free zone entry with 100% ownership (see details)\
\
Bahrain‚Äôs business environment is famously open and relationship-driven. Problems are solved faster if you invest in rapport‚Äînot just paperwork.\
Tangent: The Art of Bahraini Coffee Service & Its Business Impact\
On the surface, a cup of strong, cardamom-laced Arabic coffee in a Sijilat waiting room may seem irrelevant to visa procedures. But the tradition is more than hospitality.

1myvezp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1myvezp,Should we break open the set and have it graded? (Update 1),"TL;DR at the end.

So I ""broke"" open the set (the Capital Plastics holder is fine).  I finally found a LCS that I trusted and he thought that I should at least get the CC graded.
So I opened it up yesterday and have been looking at them with a 10X loop I bought. The CC seems to have some light parallel line abrasions around and on the chin and lips. I can only see them through the loop though so light cleaning I guess?
The 8 tail feathers doesn't seem to have as many cleaning abrasions but if you notice in the picture of the Obverse for it (which both pictures were taken at the exact same angle with the exact same lighting) it is much darker than the CC so I'm concerned it's been dipped.  In fact out of the 5 coins I think the CC and the 7/8 feathers are the only two that haven't been dipped. Also the 8 feathers has a pretty big gouge through the cheek. 
Any hoo we are still going through the collection but I'll probably send the CC off for a grading with the understanding that it will probably get a details grade.  I might send the 7/8 as well but it really depends on which level at PCGS we pick and how many vouchers that level will have. 
Also how are my pictures if anyone wants to comment? I made a little setup for my phone using a short coffee can and portrait mode on my phone. 

TL;DR: I opened up the holder to take a closer look. I think 3 out of the 5 coins have been dipped including the 8 tail feathers. The CC has had some very light cleaning I think but I'll have it graded anyway. ",1,1756041630.0,coins,2,1.0,False

1myvc47,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1myvc47,Dark chocolate ice cream with blood orange marmalade swirl,"Followed Jeni‚Äôs recipe for chocolate and added a marmalade swirl because I like dark chocolate covered orange peels. 

Chocolate syrup 
1 cup/100g unsweetened cocoa powder 
2/3 cup brewed coffee 
2/3 cup sugar
2 ounces bittersweet chocolate (55%-70% cacao) finely chopped 

Ice cream base 
2 cups whole milk 
1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons cornstarch 
1 1/2 ounces (3 tablespoons) cream cheese, softened 
1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt 
1 cup heavy cream 
1/2 cup sugar 
2 tablespoons light corn syrup 

For chocolate syrup:
combine cocoa, coffee and sugar in small saucepan, bring to boil over medium heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and add chocolate. Let stand 5 minutes and the stir until smooth.  Set aside.

For the base:
Mix 2 tablespoons milk with cornstarch to make slurry. Whisk cream cheese, chocolate syrup and salt in a bowl until smooth. 

Fill a large bowl with ice and water. This will be used as an ice bath 

Combine remaining milk, cream, sugar and corn syrup in a saucepan, bring to rolling boil. Boil 4 minutes. 
Remove from heat and mix in cornstarch slurry. While stirring, Bring back to boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat.

Whisk milk mixture into chocolate cream cheese mixture until smooth. Pour mixture in 1 gallon ziplock bag, close bag and submerge in ice bath. Chill for 30 minutes.

Transfer to ice cream maker and freeze.

Mix 1/2 cup marmalade with 1/4 cup water and cook a little. This step is to make the marmalade into a more spreadable swirl. Chill.


When done freezing, layer marmalade swirl then ice cream then marmalade then ice cream until container is filled. Freeze then eat. 

I enjoyed this and will make it again. The bits of rind and cut of the orange goes well with the chocolate.

1myvb83,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1myvb83/husband_back_to_work_tomorrow_and_lo_still_not/,Husband back to work tomorrow and LO still not nursing well,"My LO had jaundice their first week before my milk came in, so we triple fed for a while and I‚Äôve had to pump to supplement feeds. Over the last week, i thought he was getting better at nursing but there are times when he‚Äôs still clearly not getting enough. We‚Äôve seen an LC and they‚Äôve told us to keep trying and he will naturally get better as he gets bigger and more energetic. 

Now he is 4 weeks and 1 day, gaining a lot weight, and eating well. But my husband goes back to work tomorrow, and im really dreading it because we‚Äôre still not quite there yet with my baby nursing effectively. It‚Äôs especially hard in the morning when my breasts are fullest and need emptying. I end up incidentally triple feeding in the morning because I always hope he will nurse well in the morning, but after some time, he‚Äôs still hungry and my breasts are still engorged. I have a really hard time putting him to sleep in the morning too; it seems his witching hour is actually then instead of night. It seems he is more effective at nursing in the evening, so I can still work on it then when my husband is home but not sure what to do about the morning. I barely have time to eat breakfast and get coffee myself; my husband usually prepares that and cleans up.

How should I handle these tough morning sessions by myself? Skip the nursing session and just go straight for the bottle and pumping? I don‚Äôt want to give up practicing, but I have to cut something out by myself. I‚Äôve been trying to regulate my pumping times a bit better too because I now have an oversupply and have had clogged ducts so overall want to better balance that. 

We‚Äôre seeing the LC again next Friday so she may have an update for us, but I am really burning out on him having a better nurse; everyone says it‚Äôs gets better at 6 weeks so I‚Äôm hoping for that.

1myv9az,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1myv9az/should_you_buy_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_elite/,Should You Buy the Best Drip Coffee Maker Elite Gourmet EHC4128,"The Elite Gourmet EHC4128 has been a compact yet powerful addition to my kitchen. With its sleek black design and dimensions of 8""D x 9""W x 6""H, it fits perfectly on my countertop without taking over the limited counter space. The design is simple and modern, making it ideal not only for home kitchens but also for smaller setups like dorm rooms or office break areas. I personally appreciate how lightweight it is‚Äîat just 2.18 pounds, moving it around is effortless, whether I‚Äôm cleaning or reorganizing. Despite the minimalistic appearance, the machine doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy, and its aesthetic manages to blend well with any sort of kitchen decor.

**Ease of Use and Functional Features**  
One of the first things I noticed was how straightforward the Elite Gourmet EHC4128 is to operate. It‚Äôs a drip-style coffee maker with a programmable on/off switch that even my tech-resistant relatives could navigate. The semi-transparent water reservoir with a clear level indicator is another standout feature. It ensures you have precise control over the water-to-coffee ratio, which I‚Äôve appreciated on mornings when I‚Äôm not at my most coherent. Pairing this with its reusable filter not only makes brewing simpler, but also eliminates the ongoing cost of paper filters. The included filter is easy to clean, which is fantastic for someone like me who despises complicated cleanup routines.  

**Pause 'N Serve: A Lifesaver for Busy Mornings**  
The Pause ‚ÄòN Serve function has been one of my favorite discoveries. I can literally grab a quick cup mid-brew when running late for work, which I think is such an underrated feature. There‚Äôs no dripping or leaking when you pull the carafe out‚Äîjust smooth functionality. As someone who tends to be perpetually rushing, this little perk has saved me on more than one occasion.

[Ready to buy Elite Gourmet EHC4128? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b0czqctd4k/)

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
What truly matters, of course, is the coffee quality itself. The 4-cup glass carafe is perfect for a single person like me or for small gatherings. The coffee consistently turns out hot, rich, and flavorful, meeting my expectations each time. I wasn‚Äôt sure if the ‚ÄúKeep Warm‚Äù function would be impactful, but it‚Äôs proven to be a surprisingly great addition. The coffee stays consistently warm for longer without turning bitter, which is a common issue with other drip coffee makers in this price range.  

**Advantages**  
- Space-saving, compact design suitable for small areas.  
- Reusable filter reduces recurring costs and waste.  
- Pause 'N Serve function for mid-brew convenience.  
- Keep Warm feature effectively maintains coffee temperature.  

**Limitations**  
- Limited to 4 cups, not ideal for larger households.  
- Lack of advanced features like auto programming found in pricier models.  
- No audible beep to indicate brewing completion.  

**Competing Products**  
I decided to compare this coffee maker with industry staples like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew and Mr. Coffee 5-Cup Mini Brew. While those models offer similar compactness, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew gets extra marks for its dual-functionality (k-cup support and carafe brewing). However, it is pricier and requires more cleaning upkeep. The Mr. Coffee, on the other hand, is equally affordable but lacks the fully reusable filter offered by Elite Gourmet EHC4128. For environmentally-conscious users like me, this is a clear win. The Elite Gourmet excels in being a straightforward, cost-effective option for everyday brewing needs without overcomplicating functionality.

**Quality for Price**  
In terms of price-to-quality ratio, this machine is hard to beat. It delivers reliable performance, enough customization to support personal habits, and a long-term value with its reusable filter. While it doesn‚Äôt have all the bells and whistles of higher-priced competitors, it does an excellent job at its core purpose: brewing a good cup of coffee quickly and easily. For anyone on a budget or just looking for a practical coffee maker without splurging, it fits the bill perfectly.

1myv7i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1myv7i0/could_possiave_be_the_best_coffee_filter_for/,Could Possiave Be the Best Coffee Filter for Keurig Machines?,"The Possiave CECOMINOD042739 coffee filter makes its way into my daily coffee ritual with ease, a detail-oriented coffee-lover's dream. My mornings no longer feel complete without testing these charcoal water filters that promise great-tasting coffee. As someone who's been through countless coffee accessories, this product intrigued me right away. With a sleek design and natural coconut shell-activated carbon, I was curious to see if it could truly enhance my coffee experience. And, let‚Äôs just say, it hasn‚Äôt disappointed me‚Äîthough there are a few things you should know.

**Design and Compatibility**  
Straight out of the box, these filters look premium but subtle. Designed to be compatible with a wide array of Keurig machines, they work like a charm with my Keurig 2.0. It's not just the compatibility though. The fit is snug, and the micromesh material built into the filter ensures not even the tiniest bits of carbon escape to clog your coffee maker. I appreciated how universal these replacements are. Whether you're using models like the Keurig Elite, Classic, or even the Single Cup Reservoir Brewers, chances are these filters will work just fine. That kind of flexibility makes them a go-to choice.  

[Check Possiave CECOMINOD042739 price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b00x9805go/)

**Performance and Water Quality**  
What really sets these apart is the natural coconut shell activated carbon. Over the weeks of use, I've noticed a significant improvement in my coffee's flavor and aroma. The filter does an excellent job of removing impurities like calcium, chlorine, and odors while reducing limescale. My water feels ""softer,"" if that makes sense, which directly impacts my coffee's texture and taste. If you've ever had a cup of coffee that tasted off, chances are the water was partly to blame. With these filters, I genuinely feel like I'm getting the cleanest water I can ask for, extending my coffee maker's lifespan too. Plus, fewer trips to descale? Count me in!  

**Pros**  
- Filters impurities like chlorine and calcium effectively  
- Extends the lifespan of your coffee machine  
- Fits a range of Keurig models seamlessly  
- Easy to install without any mess  
- Improves coffee taste significantly  

**Downsides**  
The filters do their job well, but there‚Äôs one small hiccup I've noticed.  
- While they claim a universal fit, getting them into certain older Keurig models might take a little extra fiddling.  
- Each pack lasts a few months at best, so consistent replacement is necessary to keep up the performance.

**Ease of Use**  
Swapping out the filters takes less than a minute. One quick rinse, a snug fit, and you're set to brew. Truth be told, I'm someone who hates complicated setups, and the simplicity here is a relief. The micromesh tech ensures there‚Äôs no clogging, which adds to its user-friendly charm. If you're someone who's perpetually in a time crunch, like me, you'll really enjoy how hassle-free this process is.

**Product Comparisons**  
When comparing these replacement filters to other popular options, such as Maxtra or Brita water filters tailored for coffee machines, the Possiave filters stand out for their natural carbon design. The activated coconut carbon feels like a sustainable choice, unlike some competitors that use synthetic materials. One thing missing is a longer shelf life compared to some pricier competitors, but considering the price difference, it feels like a fair trade-off. The Maxtra filters might last a tad longer but don‚Äôt fit as many Keurig models as seamlessly as these do. Versatility, in my experience, is what sets these filters apart.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Given the versatility and functionality, these filters strike a balance between affordability and quality. While other brands might charge a premium for similar features, Possiave does a great job of keeping its price tag reasonable. And for something that consistently delivers better flavor and machine longevity, I think it's well worth the investment. If you're an avid coffee drinker like myself, you'll appreciate the fact that you're investing in quality coffee without breaking the budget.

Ceremony is outside at 330-4. Then cocktail hour inside with open bar (beer and wine) and apps. Followed by reception- toasts, dinner, dessert, dancing. 

I have thought of having them set up right when guests come for the ceremony so they can grab a hot drink while they sit outside during the ceremony. 

Or, coffee with dessert. Our dessert will be Tiramisu and cannolis.

1myv4qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1myv4qq/explore_if_mixpresso_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Explore if Mixpresso Single Serve Coffee Maker Review Brews Convenience for Coffee Lovers,"The Mixpresso DCM-B-TM Personal Single Serve Coffee Maker & Travel Mug offers a blend of convenience, performance, and practicality for busy coffee enthusiasts. Tested extensively during my hectic mornings and occasional road trips, the product delivers its promise of efficiency and quality. Whether you're rushing out the door or savoring your coffee at home, this compact coffee machine seems like a reasonable choice. 

**Ergonomic and Compact Design**  
Its lightweight and portable design caught my eye almost instantly. The coffee maker easily fits into my small kitchen countertop without hogging too much space. Its sleek black finish and modern aesthetics make it blend seamlessly with other kitchen appliances. Despite how compact it is, it doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy or cheap. When I took it to the office for a trial run, it effortlessly fit on my desk, earning a few curious glances from my colleagues, who were intrigued by its minimal footprint.

**User-Friendly Operation**  
The simplicity of this coffee maker cannot be overstated. With just one button to start the brewing process, you don't need a degree in coffee science to enjoy a quick cup. I tested the automatic shut-off feature several times and appreciated its reliability. This function came in handy, especially during those chaotic mornings when I‚Äôd prep the machine, and leave it brewing while helping my kids get ready for school. No scorched coffee pots, no forgotten appliances left running‚Äîjust peace of mind.

[Check Mixpresso DCM-B-TM price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07457z312/)

**Reusable Filter and Easy Maintenance**  
Cleaning appliances is often my least favorite chore, but fortunately, the reusable filter and easy-grip mug provide hassle-free maintenance. I washed it both by hand a few times and also threw it in the dishwasher for good measure‚Äîit worked perfectly either way. The coffee machine's ability to self-clean the brewing system with a simple button press feels like a small victory for daily convenience.

**Highlights**  
- Compact size that fits snugly even in tight spaces.  
- Effortless brewing with a single button operation.  
- Automatic shut-off adds a safety layer.  

**Performance on the Go**  
The travel mug included was probably one of the aspects I tested the most. This 14oz tumbler retains heat decently and fits well into my car‚Äôs cup holders‚Äîan underrated yet critical point for a commuting coffeeholic like me. Whether it was work commutes or leisurely weekend drives, the sturdy, leak-resistant mug became a reliable companion. While it performs well, I did notice the coffee cooled down faster than expected when temperatures dipped, which could be an issue for those who prefer their coffee piping hot.

**Adverse Aspects**  
- The mug‚Äôs heat retention could have been better for colder climates.  
- Not compatible with coffee pods, which limits versatility for those who use K-cups.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other single-cup coffee makers like the Keurig K-Mini or BLACK+DECKER Brew 'n Go, this coffee maker excels in affordability and portability. The reusable filter is a more eco-friendly option compared to the pod-dependent Keurig K-Mini. However, the Keurig outshines it with more advanced brewing options and compatibility with pre-measured pods. On the other hand, BLACK+DECKER‚Äôs Brew 'n Go seems similar in simplicity but lacks the aesthetic appeal of this product and is slightly bulkier.

**True Value**  
Weighing the price against its performance, the single-serve coffee maker provides excellent value for those seeking a minimalist solution. You won't find bells and whistles here, but for straightforward, single-person coffee brewing with portability and efficiency, it checks most boxes. Its budget-friendly position makes it a smart choice for students, small apartments, or anyone unwilling to invest in a high-end brewer.

The show sparked international outrage. Toward the end of the set, Carr delivered what he called a ‚Äòcareer ender‚Äô ‚Äì a joke about the Holocaust, in which he described the Nazis‚Äô murder of thousands of ‚ÄòGypsies‚Äô as a ‚Äòpositive‚Äô.

The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, the Auschwitz Memorial, and the UK government condemned the joke as ‚Äòappalling‚Äô, ‚Äòabhorrent‚Äô, and ‚Äòracist‚Äô; Carr, critics said, was trading on the ‚Äòlast acceptable form of racism‚Äô.

Comedy touches every part of our lives. We tell jokes at the pub, around the dinner table, and by the office coffee machine. We all know someone who makes us laugh ‚Äì and someone who seems to take things too far. But *is* there a line when it comes to humour? And if there is, who gets to draw it? Should we suspend our moral judgements when the lights go down and the curtain goes up? Or do jokes, like most speech acts, carry moral weight?

To answer these questions, we need to understand the nature of comedy itself ‚Äì what *exactly* it is we‚Äôre responding to when we laugh. Humour might be a release of nervous tension, a playful disruption of expectations, or ‚Äì more troublingly, if it applies to Carr‚Äôs joke ‚Äì a means of asserting social superiority. No doubt, comedy has the power to shape our culture and perceptions. But, as we‚Äôll find out, it also tells us something about who we are, who we ought to be, and the things we value most.

I can‚Äôt live like this.,"31M - No smoking, no drinking, 1 cup of coffee a day, diet is kind of bad, i walk 4-5 miles a day, and pretty stressed from starting a business but I‚Äôve been the same stress level for a year. Health anxiety is 10000x more stressful for me than anything else in life. 

Past 10 years a few ectopic beats per day. 

2023 - I was in the ER for kidney stones i was told I had a hiatal hernia. No palpitation issues. 

2024 - I had one day with a bad run, 5
per minute (way more than i had ever had prior), I called the ambulance and the EKG said PACs. I had puked a lot 2 days prior to that episode. 

6 weeks ago - Root canal treatment, was very stressful for me, had bad ectopics starting  2-3 days after this, maybe 40-50 a day then back to 4-5 per day.  

21 days ago - I strained hard during passing a bowel movement. I also ate pizza 5 days in a row. Two days later, worst PVCs of my life (keep in mind in 2024 it was PACs according to the ambulance, now i see PVCs on Kardia) Anytime I was standing I was getting 4-5 per minute. Sitting would majorly reduce, lying down and they would vanish. They improved over 3 days, and was back to normal. 

16 days ago - Nonstop stomach cramping for 20 hours, went to ER, was told i had ileitis. No hiatal hernia on this reading. Did throw up one time from stress, I also once again was straining for bowel movement to try and fix stomach ache. While at ER stomach pain went away, but palpitations were pretty bad that day and the following day, then got better. 

11 days ago - Worst PVCs in my life, 10 per minute, i ate a large meal before bed, not sure if caused - Called ambulance, had echo, and blood work, all came back fine besides a 4 cm aorta which i need to monitor.  

10 days ago - PVCs still bad, didn‚Äôt sleep well. 

9 days ago - PVCs improved. 

8 days ago - PVCs completely gone, ate fried salmon 45 min before bed. 

7 days ago - Woke up with pain near diaphragm, and after 3 hours had frequent PVCs, tried to stay calm; told myself it‚Äôs probably my stomach from eating before bed, and it will improve.

Day 6,5,4,3,2,1 each day has just gotten worse and worse and i‚Äôm spiraling mentally. It‚Äôs causing me to break down and cry. I didn‚Äôt even cry during kidney stone and that pain is impossible to describe with words. I‚Äôm extremely stressed and bed ridden if i want 1 per minute and feel hopeless and lost. 

When laying i‚Äôll get 1 a minute, sitting or standing or swallowing food or liquid - 10 per minute. 

Since day 6 or 5, for the first time I tried beta blocker, propranolol, 10mg for two days, it reduced the sensation but not the frequency, I stopped taking it to monitor
symptoms natural. 

since day 3 I also started taking vexium (PPI) as i assumed this pain near diaphragm was from acid reflux, have been taking this for 3 days now. It appears to have made my PVCs worse, but the first day (and it was in the evening) i only took 1/3 of a pill (7mg~) to see how my body would react and went to bed. Slept awful, and woke up for the first time with instant PVCs. 

I used to get 2-3 hours of peace after waking up, now it‚Äôs the minute i wake up. Laying still reduces the amount but only if im completely flat. Having my back propped up is still causing them. I‚Äôve been bed ridden the last 6 days trying so hard to get them to go away. Nothing is helping. I feel every single beat and they cause me
to twitch and interrupt my voice mid sentence.

1myv06i,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1myv06i/everything_you_should_know_about_gustartype_verbs/,Everything You Should Know About Gustar-Type Verbs in Spanish,"In Spanish gustar-type verbs follow a fairly unique and unusual pattern, which is why many learners, especially beginners, often make mistakes when using them. That‚Äôs why in this post I‚Äôve put together all the key information you need to know about this special group of verbs.

(Note: I‚Äôll call them ‚Äúgustar-type verbs‚Äù in this post, because gustar is the most common and recognizable verb in the group.)

What are ‚Äúgustar-type‚Äù verbs?

Unlike regular Spanish verbs, gustar-type verbs flip the normal subject‚Äìobject relationship. Instead of saying ‚ÄúI like coffee‚Äù (where I is the subject), Spanish literally says: ‚ÄúCoffee pleases me.‚Äù

That‚Äôs why these verbs are sometimes confusing, the thing is the subject, and the person is marked with an indirect object pronoun.

**Basic structure**

\[A + person\] + (indirect object pronoun) + verb (3rd person) + subject (thing)

A m√≠ me gusta el caf√©.

* A m√≠ ‚Üí clarifies/emphasizes to me
* me ‚Üí IO pronoun marking the experiencer
* gusta ‚Üí verb, agreeing with el caf√© (the subject)
* el caf√© ‚Üí the thing that pleases

Here IO pronoun (me/te/le/nos/os/les) marks the experiencer. And the **verb always agrees with the thing** (the real subject), not with the person who experiences it. In practice, this means the most common forms of the verb are the 3rd person singular or plural: gusta (singular) / gustan (plural).

Here‚Äôs a list of **the most common gustar-type verbs**:

Like / Love / Attraction

* gustar (to like), encantar (to love), fascinar (to fascinate), agradar (to please), disgustar (to displease), interesar (to interest)

Bother / Annoy / Worry

* molestar (to bother), fastidiar (to annoy), preocupar (to worry), sorprender (to surprise), extra√±ar (LA: to surprise, amaze)

Seem / Matter / Feel Like

* importar (to matter), parecer (to seem), apetecer (to feel like)

Pain / Difficulty / Effort

* doler (to hurt), costar + inf. (to be hard, cost effort)

Lack / Sufficiency / Turn

* faltar (to be missing/lack), quedar (to be left, remain), bastar (to be enough), tocar (to be someone‚Äôs turn/task)

Fit / Suit / People vibes

* quedar (clothes: to fit), sentar bien/mal (to suit, look good/bad), caer bien/mal (to get along / vibe with someone)

**Core patterns & examples**

Singular vs. plural subject

* Me interesa la historia. ‚Üí I‚Äôm interested in history.
* Me interesan los idiomas extranjeros. ‚Üí I‚Äôm interested in foreign languages.

Infinitive or clause as subject ‚Üí singular

* Me encanta viajar solo. ‚Üí I love traveling alone.
* Me preocupa que no estudies lo suficiente. ‚Üí I‚Äôm worried that you don‚Äôt study enough.

Negative & intensifiers

* No me molesta nada el tr√°fico. ‚Üí Traffic doesn‚Äôt bother me at all.
* Me fascinan much√≠simo los animales marinos. ‚Üí I‚Äôm absolutely fascinated by sea animals.

Fixed meanings (idiomatic uses)

* Hoy me toca limpiar la cocina. ‚Üí Today it‚Äôs my turn to clean the kitchen.
* Nos faltan dos jugadores para el equipo. ‚Üí We‚Äôre missing two players for the team.

Clothing / personal vibes

* Ese abrigo te sienta muy bien. ‚Üí That coat looks really good on you.
* Me cae bien tu hermana. ‚Üí I like your sister / she seems nice to me.

Pain / effort

* A Marta le duele la cabeza. ‚Üí Marta has a headache.
* Me cuesta concentrarme cuando hay ruido. ‚Üí It‚Äôs hard for me to concentrate when there‚Äôs noise.

Don‚Äôt forget that these verbs can also appear in forms other than the 3rd person, although the 3rd person is the most common form:

* Me gustas mucho. ‚Üí I like you a lot.
* Les intereso mucho a mis alumnos. ‚Üí My students are very interested in me.
* ¬øLes molestamos con la m√∫sica? ‚Üí Are we bothering you with the music?

**Be careful!** Many learners confuse verbs of this type with reflexive or pronominal verbs, but in reality they‚Äôre quite different.

Gustar-type verbs: the pronoun marks the experiencer (indirect object), while the thing is the subject.

* Me gustan los libros. ‚Üí I like books. (literally: Books please me.)

Reflexive verbs: the subject acts on itself, and the pronoun reflects the subject.

* Me lavo las manos. ‚Üí I wash my hands.

Pronominal verbs: the pronoun is an integral part of the verb itself and changes its meaning. Without the pronoun, the verb can mean something else entirely.

Examples:

* irse = to leave (different from ir = to go)
* quejarse = to complain
* darse cuenta (de) = to realize

In these cases, the pronoun is not optional, it‚Äôs built into the verb. Removing it either changes the meaning (ir vs irse) or makes the verb incomplete (quejarse always requires the ‚Äúse‚Äù).

(Technogarbage series: Volume 4)","I apologize in advance for having a magnet title. I however am not being entirely deceptive. The point of this post is to show those of you, who may think about such things where the real deception is. This post was rejected from a channel not to be named and was called ""inappropriate"" by several industrial companies - likely for hitting a nerve:

This week is the last in the Technogarbage series, so its about time we talk about...yep that.

When it comes to comparing my ""smart"" phone with my original phone (the one with a dial pad that always does its job) the outlook is grim.

Apparently, not only can the phone say it has no battery life left with a bright enough screen to operate as a flashlight for a good hour, but it will also waste that battery life to tell you so. Just love when I plug my phone in that says its at 0% being careful not to turn the screen on hoping it wont shut down just to have the stupid OS turn the screen on when I plug it in--what follows is an immediate shutdown (because that one act took the last bit of reserve battery the OS allows which isn't nothing). 

You actually can trick these phones to not ever shut down and they will stay on until the battery physically is drained to the point that it just goes black. But, smartphones don't tend to like that as much as the old phones, so says the removable battery pack which when runs out you have to carry an extra larger-than-my-phone-sized battery. My current one is twice the size as my phone's size!! Why not upgrade? I just recently paid 600$ for this phone, I'm not upgrading, sorry! It was top of the line 2 minutes ago and now its obsolete! There are literally games in the play store that will tell me so!

  They might as well mix the lithium in with our drinking water and spray it on our crops. Responsible recycling aside, I am include to believe what I see -- and what I see is techno-garbage being stomped on and ground up on the pavement, swept up by street sweepers, gone to the landfill OR mommy and daddy and screamy kids ""this phone is dead"" \*tosses it in garbage can with the coffee filters and empty soup can\*. 

You might get a few hipsters and lower income people going to get money back for phones but most the time they have to go out of their way for that, and many of em don't bother or put it off so long that its not worth anything by the time recycling or throwing it away becomes an issue. Heck even I have a stack of dead phones in my closet.  And if I die tomorrow, the people cleaning out my house will likely pitch it right in the dumpster with the other stuff, not mince through and run it to Walmart to get maybe a total of 5$ worth of rebates when they have 17 other houses to clean that day. 

End point: companies need to stop practices that promote the needless creation of waste:

The worst things companies do:

\#1 obsolescence of a product, driver, hardware when it is still used

\#2 plan ahead to make products obsolete regardless of whether the devices last far longer or not

\#3 forced obsolescence: forcing customers to abandon hardware because of a new product when the original would be able to do the same things or could have adapted to do so

\#4 full-device replacement - no more do companies try to make money solely by accessories - now the product itself must be re-bought again and again. Imagine if we had to buy a whole new toaster every week because bread was  sized specifically for the newest toaster and constantly changed shape for that reason. This is practically what is happening with smart phones.  Many of the technologies that are added to the 'next generation' are things that could have either been a firmware upgrade or a hardware upgrade (or even just in software or a partial upgrade) but entire devices must be replaced instead.

\#5 forbid support of any old product and deliberately block customers from services to their old hardware

\#6 promote partner company programs that blockade consumers from buying or using products that would last longer

\#7 make certain high-impact parts extremely fragile, or fail to include part of the device (or sell it as an add-on only) for example, phone cases, screen covers/protectors. These are all things that should be part of the device to begin with.

Surprise! There's 1 more!  Haha, you got tricked, now you know how I felt when I saw my phone went out of date!!

\#8 make phones part of a fleeting ""wardrobe style"" and equate them to clothing. Clothing doesn't put lead, lithium and mercury into our drinking water nor does it put tons of microplastic in our oceans. But we see this in more industries than just phones. Lighters, cars, you name it, making it part of ""style"" sells but also makes it have an extremely high impact on harmful waste. 

This and many more things we should be aware of, and stop doing, or help others do so. If we don't support these companies, they will eventually change their ways. It won't be easy, fast, or simple. But taking action is the first move toward the goal :P",1,1756040496.0,RandomTruth,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm currently job hunting for a full-time analyst role in Canada ideally in data, business, or marketing analytics. I‚Äôm open to local, remote, or relocation roles (as long as it‚Äôs within Canada), and I‚Äôve attached my resume as an image. I‚Äôd really appreciate any constructive feedback.

https://preview.redd.it/hf78z1gyrykf1.png?width=5100&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f9348a45c064a3ac831359f62708023ab9f61e2

**What‚Äôs going on:**  
I‚Äôve applied to a number of roles over the past few months, but haven‚Äôt heard back much. I‚Äôm not applying super aggressively (not hundreds), partly because I struggle with motivation and confidence. Right now, I‚Äôm mostly applying through LinkedIn by filtering for jobs posted in the past 24 hours. I know people recommend tailoring every application and doing coffee chats, but honestly, I‚Äôm overwhelmed and burned out. I‚Äôve been watching others post their amazing resumes online and keep doubting if mine is even good enough.

One recruiter did reach out for an urgent hybrid e-commerce analyst role but the role required immediate start. Although I promised I could relocate within two weeks, I suspect my current overseas location raised concerns. Since then, I‚Äôve kept my location a bit vague. (I do have a valid Canadian work permit and can move quickly.)

I feel I might be a better fit for smaller companies or global-facing teams that value adaptability, curiosity, and a diverse background.

¬†

**What I‚Äôd love feedback on:**

1. Are there any red flags or weak spots in my resume?
2. Does anything come across as unfocused or inconsistent?
3. Am I underselling myself‚Ä¶ or overreaching in any way?
4. Any tips to make my resume stronger  without sounding too generic?

¬†

To be honest, I‚Äôm not chasing a dream job. I just want a solid opportunity.

My last job only lasted 5 months due to restructuring, but during that time I had to build everything from scratch with little support. It taught me a lot ¬†about ambiguity, self-learning, and pushing forward when things aren‚Äôt clear.

I‚Äôve heard a thousand times that being physically in Canada helps with hiring. I get it. But living in Toronto without steady income, no nearby family, and constant uncertainty is‚Ä¶ exhausting. So please I‚Äôm not looking for judgment about my current location. I‚Äôm just trying to keep going.

1myus5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1myus5w/the_donut_that_never_left/,The Donut That Never Left,"Jelly-filled. Pink icing and rainbow sprinkles delicately blanketed the top of its exquisite, glistening mass. This delightfully devious little body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop tempted me to the point of no return. I pressed the tip of my index finger against the glass and said,

""This one.""

I knew I shouldn't have. But I'd been so good lately. I deserved a treat. And besides, I'd make up for it at the gym later, then pound a fuck-ton of water and flush that bitch right out. Yeah, it's no big deal. It's Friday: cheat day. And this week's been hell. I *needed* this.

""That'll be $1.99, sir.""

The lady at the counter smiled and handed me the bulging bag. I held it close, pressing its warm weight against my chest. My mouth pooled with saliva as I slid her my debit card. 

""Anything else?""

I glanced back toward the glass dome filled with plump pastries, then shook my head. They all looked like whores, slathered in chocolate and cheaply seductive‚Äîno substance. Nope, I had everything I needed right here in this greasy white paper bag. *Mine* had fruit. She handed my card back over and said, 

""Have a nice day!""

I grinned, looking down at the bag cradled in my arms. I sure as shit will, I thought. Then, I hurried back to my car to devour this goddess of a donut in seclusion. I needed privacy; this was a moment to be savored. Carefully, I eased my hand into the bag's opening until the tips of my fingers met her soft, pillowy posterior. Once I'd gripped onto the end, I gently pulled to reveal divine perfection. 

The icing lay undisturbed; every single sprinkle had held on. It didn't feel right to just go in at it. No, it was too beautiful to be ravaged like that. It begged to be adored and cherished‚Äîworshiped. I couldn't just bite into this donut like some sort of monster. The jelly would spill out all over, and I didn't have any napkins. 
 
I held it up to my face, admiring the flawless sheen of its glaze in the soft morning light. I inhaled deeply, slowly taking in the heavenly scent that filled me with euphoria. Then, I slid my tongue gently across the surface of its sweet, crispy skin. And that's where it all began. This simple little act of mindless self-indulgence would later become the single biggest regret of my life.

Yet, a smile crept across my face as the intense warmth of this magnificent exterior overwhelmed me. I had one thought, and one thought only: I needed to get to what was inside. Slowly, I sank my teeth deep into its sugary flesh, carefully removing the tiniest of morsels and releasing a floodgate of warm, red jelly. I let the intoxicating, chunky viscus pour into my mouth and surrendered to the ecstasy. 

After that, I blacked out.

When I came to, I'd devoured the whole thing. Not a trace of it remained; even my fingers had been licked clean and sucked dry. I searched the bag, hoping there might be a tiny smidge of icing left behind, but nothing. Not even a sprinkle. It was all gone. *Shit,* I don't even get to keep the memory of enjoying it? Why did I scarf it down so quickly? 

The only evidence that I'd even done so was the lump pressing hard at the back of my throat as the last bite of my breakfast made its way down my esophagus and onto the gullet. Guess I need to work on that whole *'self-control'* thing.

As I drove to work in my sugared-up intoxication, the lump began to squirm. Must be a burp trying to come out, I thought; probably swallowed a fuck ton of air during my binge-fit. I slammed my fist against my chest, but it didn't help. Instead, I could feel my throat tightening around the bulge, trying to push it down. No‚Äîthe opposite. It felt like that hunk of donut was forcing its way down, in spite of my body trying to stop it. What the fuck. 

My eyes watered as I began to cough, choking on the wad of dough that had now firmly planted itself just above my sternum. The bitch wasn't moving at all. I struggled to keep my eyes on the road as I frantically searched the floor of my passenger seat for a half-empty bottle of water. Finally, I laid my hand on one, leaned my head back, and chugged. 

Down she went, without a fight. I smiled and threw the empty bottle back down onto the floor where it belonged. Then, I took a deep breath of relief. *God,* how stupid would it have been if I'd choked to death on a fucking donut? Embarrassing. I wiped my eyes and continued down the road. 

By the time I got to work, the donut had reached my stomach, landing like a boulder dropped off a cliff. I ran to the bathroom, thinking I had to take a shit. I sat in that stall straining for at least 10 minutes, but nothing came out. So, I stood up and pulled my pants back on. Then, I turned around and looked at the toilet. I froze. There, floating in the water, was a single blue sprinkle.

My eyes widened, and I blinked a few times. Then, I leaned forward to make sure I was really seeing what I thought I was. Yep‚Äîa sprinkle. Not a poop-sized one. A regular one. My body snapped upright. No fucking way that came out of my butt. It had to have been on my pants. I just didn't notice. Yeah, of course, that's what it was.

I walked from the bathroom laughing at myself for getting freaked out, even momentarily. My stomach was still killing me, though. The damn donut was sloshing around in the water I'd chugged like a ship caught in a storm. With each step I took, I could feel it rocking back and forth. 

*Gurgle, gurgle. Slosh, slosh.*

When I got to my desk, I started searching around in all the drawers for a roll of Tums. I got excited for a second, until I realized it was just the empty wrapper I'd left myself to be fooled by later. Past me is such an asshole. 

*Gurrrrrp!*

""Shut up.""

Fuck. I had to do something, and quickly. My stomach was visibly rippling at that point, and I could barely stay seated. I thought about undoing my belt, but I didn't want to get accused of being a pervert. Especially not after I accidentally elbowed Sharon from accounting in the boob last week. That was her fault for crowding me at the coffee pot, though. Unfortunately, HR didn't see it that way.

Wait‚Äîcoffee! That'll make me shit, I thought. Even though my stomach was past maximum capacity, it seemed like my only option. Besides, a shot of black coffee to the gut might just actually do the trick to move this mass along. The bitch had already overstayed her welcome. It was time for an eviction notice. 

I hurried to the break room to find Sharon at the coffee pot. *Of course.* I kept my distance as we silently exchanged awkward glances. I didn't want to look her in the eye, so I stared at the coffee pot in her hands instead. I was so uncomfortable. I could barely keep still as my gurgles and groans echoed through the otherwise empty room. She cut her pour short, grabbed a handful of Sweet'N Low packets, then rushed out of the door while covering her nose. *Pftt*‚Äîprobably thought I was farting. Believe me, lady. I wish I *could* fart.

I poured a splash and a half into my cup and threw it back, still scalding. It burned all the way down, but I didn't care. The pain in my throat was a welcome distraction from the mayhem that was going on in my stomach. The roof of my mouth was going to be fucked for a day or two. But, I figured, if it worked, it would all be worth it. After all, this was my last-ditch effort to be able to make it through the rest of my workday. 

It also turned out to be a big mistake.

The searing black liquid landed with an eruption. I immediately doubled over in the worst pain I'd ever felt in my life. The wad of sugary dough had begun to thrash violently, slamming itself against the walls of my stomach. No, I'm not fucking joking. I could feel it. Not just in my stomach‚Äîwith my hands, too. I literally felt this donut pounding from the inside out, lifting my skin as it pushed against its gastric prison. 

I ran full speed to the bathroom, praying I'd make it there before I passed out, vomited, or shit my pants. Or, all three. My belly bounced as I ran, suddenly swollen like a puppy with worms. I thought I was bloated before, but now I was literally about to pop. The movement made the pain infinitely worse, but I had no choice. Fuck this. It had to come out.

The stall door slammed against the wall, and I fell to my knees, gripping the toilet in preparation. My face was ice-cold and clammy. Warm saliva flooded my mouth. Yes! Come out! Be gone, bitch! 

*GUUURRRPPP*

I began to heave and spit into the toilet. The mass was so close I could taste it, but nothing was coming out. It was fighting me. I shoved my finger down into my throat, scraping against the burnt roof of my mouth. I winced from the pain, and my eyes started watering uncontrollably. A few gags, and up she came. 

A putrid flurry of pink sludge spewed from my mouth, swirled with a deep, crimson red foam. It splattered back up into my face when it hit the toilet at lightning speed. Fuck, so much came out of me, I can't even explain it. But that was only phase one. Next came the chunks. 

By the time I was done, I thought I was going to lose consciousness. The room was spinning, and I struggled to catch my breath, so I lowered myself onto the floor, still hugging the toilet. 

I couldn't help but inspect this ungodly force that had just come out of me. Slowly, I lifted my head and peeked over the seat. *Holy fuck.* I gazed down at the thick pink vomit in utter shock and disgust. Shit, it looked like I'd barely even chewed this donut. Even the rainbow sprinkles had all remained whole, floating around in the sludge like tiny specks of whimsy in a cotton candy-colored massacre. Surrounding them were a few large globs of fleshy beige, accompanied by several smaller red clumps. *Christ.* I just *had* to get the one with fruit, huh?

Suddenly, my eyes fixed on the largest red chunk floating in the middle of the sludge. It looked different than the other ones. Shaped weird. And it was... *moving?* I wiped my eyes. Yes‚Äîit was fucking moving! Convulsing. Constricting. Sputtering red goop from both ends. *No fucking way.*

I stood up so fast, I nearly fell backwards out of the stall. Black spots began to appear in my line of vision. I gripped onto the threshold with both hands as I swayed, trying to regain balance. I held my breath and slowly leaned forward to look again. It stopped.

Oh, thank God. It *wasn't* moving. Get it together, bro. It's just a chunk of strawberry; how could it be moving? I almost wanted to poke at it, but considering how vile the mess I'd made in the toilet was, I resisted that urge.

The hinges of the bathroom door creaked, and footsteps began to approach. I quickly reached over and flushed the rainbow sprinkled slurry. It smelled like death‚Äîsickly sweet with a hint of berry. I desperately tried to fan the stink away with one hand while wiping my face with the other.

When I exited the stall, Jerry from sales was at the urinal. He turned to look at me as I approached the sink, visibly disgusted by the pungent odor that had completely filled the room at that point.  

""Gnarly case of food poisoning,"" I told him. 

He nodded, then focused his eyes back in front of him. With a splash of water and a squirt of soap, I quickly washed my hands and ran out of there. On the way back to my desk, I bumped into my boss, who promptly asked what the hell I'd been doing all morning. 

""Sorry, sir. I think I'm coming down with something.""

He folded his arms in front of him and scrunched his eyebrows. 

""That's the excuse you're going with this time?""

""Ask Jerry, he'll tell you. I was just in the bathroom. If you want proof, go in there and take a big whiff."" 

""Alright, that's enough,"" he said. ""Just make sure that report is on my desk before lunch, then you can leave if you need to. And don't forget, you're still on disciplinary probation after last week.""

""Yes, sir.""

Fuck. I forgot all about that damn report. I hadn't even started it yet, and it was almost 10:00. At least my stomach was starting to feel better. My abs were sore from all the heaving, but now that just meant I could skip the gym later. I'd already puked up the donut anyway, so the carbs didn't count. 

Shit, what a weird ass morning I was having‚Äîalmost got killed by a donut twice. What an evil bitch! She tempted me, then tortured me. Well, lesson learned. Not going back to that bakery again. At least now she was gone, and it was over. 

I sat down at my desk, opened up a Word document, and began typing nonsense. My thoughts were all jumbled up, and my head was throbbing from straining so hard. I kept having to retype each sentence over and over until it made sense. Before I knew it, another hour had gone by, and I was sweating. 

My hand reached up to wipe away the droplets accumulating on the ridge of my brow. Right away, I noticed something weird. My sweat was thick. Like... *goop.* I slowly pulled my hand away in confusion to look at the substance that had just excreted from my pores. 

It was clear, like sweat's supposed to be. But there was a ton of it. And it didn't drip. No‚Äîinstead, it gathered in a rounded clump at the edge of my fingertips. Then, I pressed my fingers together. It was sticky, too. *Oh, god.* I slowly raised my hand up to my lips and tasted. It was fucking *sugar.*

Okay... something weird is definitely going on. What the fuck was in that donut?! I had to leave work. Immediately. To hell with this damn report. I needed to go home and start googling. And also take a shower, because my face and hands were all sticky. Oh‚Äîand I still smelled like vomit, too. 

I got up and left everything on my desk as it was, including the open document of word salad on my computer screen. Hopefully, my boss would see all that and realize this was an emergency. If not, oh well, whatever. I'll just deal with it on Monday, I thought.

I raced home, taking a different route to avoid having to pass that bakery. I felt like just the sight of it might make me sick again. There had to be something wrong with that donut. I felt totally normal until I met that sugary bitch. Maybe it really was food poisoning. *Fuck*‚Äîthe strawberries! E. coli, duh. *Damn*, should've gotten one of the whores; chocolate would've never betrayed me like that.

Food poisoning didn't exactly explain the sugary sweat, but I was still convinced that's what it was. Maybe I got so sick, I'd started hallucinating? Yeah, that *had* to be it. Ha! That donut wasn't actually thrashing in my stomach. The strawberry chunk wasn't ever moving. And the goopy sweat? Probably just some leftover glaze I didn't realize was there. *Pftt.* I shook my head and chuckled to myself. There was nothing to worry about. It'll pass.

I got home, threw my keys onto the side table, and headed straight for the bathroom. I decided to brush my teeth first. My breath was so rank I couldn't stand it anymore, and the taste of sugar and stomach acid still lingered on my tongue. I brushed the hell out of my entire mouth for at least 2 1/2 minutes, then spit into the sink. When I saw what had come out of my mouth, I almost choked. 

Sprinkles. A bunch of them. God, how did they all get stuck in my teeth like that? How did I not feel them? I cupped my hand under the faucet and rinsed my mouth out a few times. Each time I spit, more came out. It seemed to be an endless supply of them, like there was a God damned sprinkle dispenser somewhere behind my molars. But finally, after the fifth rinse, I ran my tongue across my teeth and didn't feel any more. So, I got into the shower and figured if anything else weird happened, I'd just worry about it then.

Then, something else weird happened.

I turned the hot water on, stepped under the stream, closed my eyes and began running my hands across my skin. My entire body felt tacky and gross. I reached up to find that my hair felt the same way‚Äîit had formed into five or six clumps on the top of my head. *Yuck.* Instantly, I pulled my hand away and opened my eyes to grab the shampoo bottle. That's when I noticed it. 

The water that was dripping from my body was milky white. *What the fuck?* I jumped back from the shower head and looked up. The water coming out of it was clear. I scrunched my eyebrows, then slowly looked back down. The thick, milky drippings had started to collect in a pile, clogging up the drain. 

I tried to slide the clump away with my foot, only to have it spread itself in between my toes, like when you step on a glob of peanut butter. It sent a shiver down my spine, and I started flapping my foot around trying to fling the goop off of it, but it wasn't moving. So, I reached down to dislodge whatever it was by hand. Just then, I was hit with an oddly familiar scent. The same one that had filled the air of that bakery. *Sugar.* 

*Jesus H. Christ*‚Äîdid I try to fuck it?! Just how much icing did I smear on myself? Shit, I must've rubbed that fucking donut all over my body. Hell no, man. I've done some weird shit in my life, but never with food. That thing must've been drugged! 

My hand shot up to my forehead, and my eyes raced back and forth as I desperately tried to remember anything at all from the ten minutes or so I had blacked out. Nothing. Not a damn thing. God, I *had* to have been slipped something. That was the only explanation that made sense.

My heart started pounding and I began to feel woozy. I was obviously under the influence of some type of drug, but I had no idea what. I quickly washed my hair, then grabbed the loofah and started frantically scrubbing my body from the top down. 

When I reached my butt, I used my hand to wash in between my cheeks since the loofah's too rough. I was immediately disgusted to find there were little specks of something buried deep within my ass crack. 

I didn't even need to look‚ÄîI knew what they were. But still, there I was, gawking down at my hand in complete and utter shock nonetheless. Sprinkles. At least a dozen or more. 

I was ashamed and completely disgusted with myself. I couldn't believe I'd actually scratched my ass while eating that donut! Shit, hopefully I waited until after I was finished. But, either way, that meant my fingers were... and then I... Oh, *God.* 

Whatever‚Äînothing I could do about it now. I rinsed the butt sprinkles from my hand, then continued down to my legs. They were dry. Like, *really* dry. I'm talking sandpaper. Large flakes of my skin started to slough off as I scrubbed, plopping onto the shower floor like tiny, wet crepes. 

I've never been good about moisturizing, and to be honest, I usually don't even wash anything below the knees, but today I had to. They must've just been overdue for a good exfoliating, I thought. 

Once I got out and toweled myself off, I noticed my upper body felt waxy and smooth. Too smooth. It was like a slight, buttery layer of film sitting on top of my skin. My bottom half was the opposite. I thought all those skin flakes coming off would've helped, but my legs still looked extremely dry‚Äîalmost scaly. I dropped the towel and reached down with my bare hand. When my fingers touched one of the flaked-off portions of my calf, my heart sank. My skin... it felt *crispy.*

Hell no‚ÄîI am *not* dealing with this right now. I'll just lotion them later if they still feel rough when I sober up. I shook my head, then leaned forward over the sink to look into the mirror. My pupils were enormous, and a fresh coat of glaze covered my face with a lustrous, glossy sheen. 

*Shit... you're tripping balls, man.*

There was nothing I could do but try to wait it out. If I went to the hospital and started explaining my '*symptoms*', I'd be fitted for a brand new pair of grippy socks in a heartbeat. No. There was no need to panic. I just needed to let whatever the hell drug this was wear off. Run its course. Yeah, it's no big deal. It'll be okay.

I thought sleep would be the answer. So, I hurried off to my bedroom and started covering all the windows with dark blankets to block out the midday sun as best I could. I didn't even bother putting clothes back on‚ÄîI figured I'd end up sweating like a pig during this detox anyway. No need to dirty another pair of underwear. 

By the time I'd finished blacking out the room, I was already starting to feel like I was burning up. It was like an oven had suddenly kicked on inside me. I plopped myself down onto the bed, splayed out like a starfish, and waited. 

First, the nausea returned. I had to close my eyes to stop the ceiling from spinning. Then, the heat within me intensified. This fierce burning sensation started to tear through my body, radiating deep from my core. *Oh, God.* It was almost unbearable. I clenched onto the bedsheet underneath me with both fists and tried desperately to control my breathing. A buzzing sensation began to spread through my body, like every cell inside me vibrating all at once. My eyes rolled into the back of my head, and the room went black. 

When I woke up, the slivers of sunlight that had been peering out from the sides of the blankets were gone. My eyes darted over to the little red numbers piercing through the darkness of my room. It was 5:00 AM. *Jesus Christ*, I'd slept the entire rest of the day and all through the night. 

I remained still for a moment, trying to assess my mental and physical state, praying everything had gone back to normal. The nausea had passed, but my body was still burning up. My mouth was unbelievably dry, and the air in my room felt stagnant and heavy. It seemed to push down from above like a weighted blanket‚Äîsmothering me. I forced in a deep breath, and when I did, I noticed the smell. That fucking *smell.*

However, it wasn't until I attempted to reach up and wipe my face that I began to truly realize the horror I'd woken up to. My arm. It wouldn't move‚Äîit was stuck to the bed. The other one, too. And... and my legs. *What the fuck??* My head shot up in a panic, and the pillow came with it.

When I looked down at my body, my jaw dropped open. I was huge. I'm talking gigantic. Bloated, puffy, and round beyond belief. I'd gone from a size 34 pants to at least a 52. Not even joking. It was like I'd gained a hundred pounds overnight. I couldn't believe it. This couldn't be happening. I'd slept almost 20 hours‚Äîthe drug should've worn off!

As I glared down in shock, I could see that my now rotund upper body was caked in a thick, opaque layer of pasty goop. It had dripped and clung to the bed, sticking to the skin of my back and arms like a human glue trap. 

From the waist down, I was surrounded by a large, dark red stain on the sheets. Is that‚Äî? *No. Can't be.* I blinked a few times, then squinted as my eyes strained to adjust. The mystery red liquid had dried to a crust at the edges, forming a giant congealed mass beneath me. 

I struggled to lift myself up further, forcing my neck forward as hard as I could. Then, I gave myself one good push. As my body squished against itself, more of the thick red goo suddenly appeared... oozing‚Ä¶ from my fucking belly button.

The secretion slowly slid from the side of my stomach into the pile below, landing with a wet *plap.* Instinct took over, and I started to thrash and writhe against the bed, desperate to free myself from this disgusting, sticky goop from hell. 

Peeling my top half from the sheets felt like ripping off a massive band-aid. Thick white strings clung to me as the gummy substance stretched and pulled at my skin, trying to force me back down. I bit down hard on my bottom lip and just went for it. I'll admit it‚ÄîI screamed. Screamed like a bitch. 

Once my arms were free, I moved on to my legs. The red stuff was worse. Much thicker, less give. It was agonizing. Huge, crispy strips of flesh tore from my legs, remaining glued to the clotted red mess that had leaked from my unrecognizably grotesque body. After I'd completely broken free from my adhesive prison, I hobbled to the bathroom, dripping the entire way. 

I stared at myself in the mirror, my gargantuan, sugar-slathered body shaking uncontrollably. *Fuck*. I shouldn't have just gone to sleep. I should have dealt with this when I had the chance. That donut wasn't drugged, it was cursed. Something in it. A demon‚Äîpossessing me. Changing me. It had hollowed me out and was growing inside me.

I collapsed onto the cold floor and buried my face in my hands as I began to cry. Not tears, of course. Instead of droplets of wetness, I felt little taps of grit. I ripped my hands away from my eyes. 

Sprinkles. Rainbow fucking sprinkles. 

An animalistic shriek erupted from my lungs, and I hurled them across the room. They hit the wall with a *ping*, scattering all over the floor like confetti at my funeral. Mocking me. 

I pulled myself back up to my feet, limped over to the shower, and got in. I scrubbed, wincing in pain as the loofah scraped against my raw skin. To distract myself, I started trying to weigh my options. I couldn't ignore this anymore. I knew I needed help, desperately. I just didn't know who to turn to. Shit, doctors wouldn't know what to do with me at this point‚Äîwhatever was happening to me had very quickly devolved into something modern medicine couldn't do shit about. 

I thought about calling my cousin, Sonia, in Maine. Her husband had gone through some weird body shit recently. Maybe she'd know what to do. She'd been vague about the details of what happened to him when she told me about it a few months ago. Something about fish? What I did remember was she had been very clear about one thing: it didn't end well. 

Scratch that. If she couldn't help him, she definitely couldn't help me either. I gripped the loofah tighter, my body trembling from the pain and fear. I had to do something. I couldn't allow myself to crumble under the weight of my insane circumstance. I refused to let this *thing* take over. 

I shuffled out of the tub, almost slipping on the pink sludge I'd left behind as I lifted my massive, jiggly leg over the side. I carefully dried myself off, soaking up the leftover glaze from my creases. Then, I shakily began trying to bandage up the gaping wounds on my legs.

They were oozing the same shit that had come out of my belly button. I set a piece of gauze down on top of one of the rips in my flesh, and the redness seeped through instantly. It wasn't blood. Deep down, I already knew that. Still, I reached down, scooped up a dollop with my fingers, and sniffed it. *Strawberry.*

Whatever the fuck was happening to me, I was powerless to stop it alone. There was only one thing left I could do. So, I threw a blanket over my half-glazed naked body, since none of my clothes fit anymore, then scuttled out to my car and began tearing down the street‚Äîheaded toward that fucking bakery.

The door slammed against the wall with a loud bang as I busted through. The stupid little bell dislodged and went sliding across the floor. The place was empty, except for the lady behind the counter. She looked up at me and smiled. 

""Welcome back! Did you enjoy your donut, sir?""

I just stood there in the doorway for a moment, completely dumbfounded, as her smile widened into a sinister, toothy grin. Did I *enjoy* the donut? The sheer audacity of this woman. There I was, shaped like a fucking eclair, covered in only a blanket and dripping red goop everywhere. I sure as shit did not.¬† A fiery rage began to simmer within me. And then, I exploded.

*""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO THAT DONUT?!?!‚Äù*

She laughed. 

""Why, nothing, sir. Nothing at all.""

""Bullshit! What the fuck is happening to me?!"" I demanded. 

""Exactly what was meant to happen,"" she answered. 

""You cursed it! *Christ,* I fucking knew it!! What is this, huh? Some kinda donut voodoo shop?!""

She shook her head and chuckled dismissively.¬† 

""Sir, I just sell the donuts. I don't make them."" 

I stormed up to the counter and threw the sticky blanket down onto the ground, revealing the gruesome form I was now trapped inside of.  

""I don't give a shit who makes them! I want to know why the hell this is happening to my body!!"" 

""Isn't it obvious?"" she giggled. ""You are what you eat."" 

I slammed my fist down onto the counter.

""I want to see your fucking manager, NOW!""

""Of course, sir. Right this way.""

She calmly stepped away from the register and gestured for me to follow her to the back of the bakery. I stomped down the long, sterile, white hallway as she casually led the way, glancing over her shoulder every so often with a smirk. I didn't know what I was going to say when I got to wherever we were going, but I needed answers‚Äîand this bitch apparently wasn't going to tell me jack shit. 

We reached a large door at the end of the hall with a sign that said '*MDI*' in big, bold, red letters. It was fitted with a padlock and a keypad near the handle. The lady pulled out a set of keys and fiddled with them while I waited impatiently. Finally, she opened the lock, unlatched the door, then hovered over the keypad as she punched the numbers in. A loud beep pierced through the silence, and the door slowly squealed open. 

Inside that room was the most incomprehensible horror I could've ever dared to imagine. A being so grotesque‚Äîso shocking. It froze me in place as I struggled to make sense of the unholy sight before me. 

It filled the entire room. Not only in size, but in presence. It felt ancient. And powerful. Something beyond this world... this universe. I was in awe, and yet, overwhelmed with revulsion at what I was forced to behold.

Thick, pulsating lines of bulging, red jelly snaked around doughy coils of glossy, beige flesh like veins. Layers of soured pink icing dripped from beneath a heap of encrusted rainbow sprinkles embedded firmly atop its hideous, glistening mass. This sickeningly enormous body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop terrified me to my absolute core. 

It had no eyes‚Äîjust mouths. Dozens upon dozens of perfectly round gaping holes stretched across the front of it, each filled with rows of tiny, sharp, crystalline teeth that sparkled under the heat lamps above. 

And, it breathed. The coils slowly lifted and fell like folds in a stomach, as gurgling globs of chunky red viscera sputtered from the center. Steam radiated from its crispy posterior. Each time it shifted, the smell of sugar and yeast filled the air. Suffocatingly sweet and warm with rot. 

Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind me. I tore my eyes away from the monstrosity to look at the counter lady, who was now standing in front of the door, blocking my only way out. 

""*What the fuck is that?*"" I uttered with wide eyes. 

She narrowed her gaze, and the smile dropped from her face.

""Mother Donut calls to us all... and we answer."" 

I turned to look back at the oozing, demonic atrocity. 

""*This?* This is what I'm turning into?!"" 

""No, don't be ridiculous,"" she said. ""This is what created you. And those who came before you. Go on‚Äîspeak to her. Ask your questions."" 

I gulped hard as I looked up at this sugary mammoth towering over me, then finally mustered up the courage to ask, 

""What's happening to me? What... *am* I?""

The plethora of holes began to move in unison as the bellowing growl of a hundred voices emitted from the effulgent mass at once. 

""You are my offspring. My sweet creation. And from within you, my seed shall spread.""

Blackness crept in from the corners of my vision as I zeroed in on this ungodly creature. I was no longer afraid. I was furious. I'd been infected with some sort of parasitic donut spawn? And for what‚Äîall because I just wanted to enjoy my cheat day? What kind of horse shit is that?? It wasn't fair... I deserved a treat!

""No, the fuck it will not!"" I screamed. ""You better undo this shit right now! Fix me back like I was or..."" 

My voice began to crack with desperation. 

""Or, I'll fucking kill you!! I didn't sign up for this shit, man! It... it was just a God damned donut!""

Giant, red bubbles suddenly spewed from her center mass like lava from a volcano. They popped and splattered my face with piping hot, rotten jelly as a guttural laugh vibrated from the mouths. 

""It cannot be undone,"" she said. ""The transformation is nearly complete, my child."" 

""Please... *oh, God*... no!"" I begged. ""I don't deserve this!!""

She growled. 

""You chose this. You agreed to it. The terms of purchase were stated clearly on the receipt you left behind on the counter without a glance."" 

The room went dead silent. I was too late. Too stupid. Too fucking self-indulgent and careless to prevent my own demise. There was nothing I could do‚Äînothing left to say. It was time to deal with this. Time to face the facts. I was fucked. 

Sprinkles began to trickle down my face. The oven inside me suddenly shot up to 350 degrees. I bolted towards her‚Äîfull speed, fists wailing. If I was going down, this bitch was coming with me. 

Just before I reached her, I felt a sudden, sharp pain in the back of my head. I fell backward, and my body hit the ground instantly with a massive thud. I looked up and saw the counter lady standing over me, now blurry, and holding a rolling pin. Then... darkness, and the faint echo of a wet, bubbling laugh. 

When I awoke, I couldn't move, but I could see. My eyes darted all around. I was no longer in the lair of the beast. Instead, I was in a white room, surrounded by a warm, fuzzy, bright light. Everything looked soft and inviting. Placid. Peaceful. Perfect. I thought I had died. I thought maybe I was in heaven. I couldn't have been more wrong. 

*BAM!!!!!*

A giant fingertip slammed down from above, pressing hard against some sort of invisible forcefield around me. It was... it was *glass*. I was under a fucking glass dome‚Äîlying next to a chocolate whore. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. Panic surged through my jelly-filled veins.

I was paralyzed. Powerless. Positively petrified. My strawberry heart thrashed hard against my pink-slathered, rainbow-sprinkled chest as a booming voice rattled the tray beneath me.

I don‚Äôt want to buy like Rs. 100+ bars of cadburys and get a palm sized insult. I like peanut chikki too, but with varying inconsistency and my now not so great teeth (this is something long term, not cavities from sweets), I‚Äôm staying off them for a bit. On the days I‚Äôm in office, we sometimes grab a softie from MCD. 

I‚Äôm looking for alternatives. I want to buy something in bulk for my sweet cravings. Don‚Äôt want to overpay unless it is absolutely amazing quality. Would prefer something that is softer and needs lesser chewing (my teeth don‚Äôt allow even 5 star). Some things I‚Äôve tried are:

- Imli candy - absolutely tasty and nice. I order online. This is tried and tested. Want something new. 
- tried a few Churans and anardana. Inconsistent 
- tried amla muraba- nice but my teeth protest as the ones I ordered are a bit hard. 
- I‚Äôm thinking of dates, but that would be one of the last options. 

What else can I get in the city or order online?

1myuott,https://i.redd.it/52s4814lrykf1.jpeg,"Kids, FYI I had one of those delayed responses this morning where I realized what I could have said AFTER the moment was over.","I was at the gas station getting coffee and a man and his man friend were also there. Man A, standing at the computer where you order breakfast, asks Man B if he is going to get a premade sandwich or order one, and Man B said he was going to get one premade, so then Man A decided he‚Äôd do the same, leaves the touch screen and comes over to get coffee. Man A says hello to me as he approaches the coffee station and I greet him, asking him how he is this morning. 

Man A replies emphatically that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôll pass.‚Äù A few moments later he clarifies that it‚Äôs still early and there‚Äôs still time for someone to ruin his day, his mood, his upbeat vibe. 

After I got back out to my car I thought, ‚Äúdamn. I should have told him about boundaries!!!‚Äù 

So, kids, what I think we need are billboards for boundaries. You know, little tips along the road (metaphor for the journey of life) that sort of guide the way.   Everyone should know about boundaries because everyone deserves to protect themselves.

People gave ministry about the nature of meeting for worship, and also about how we meet with people in the world outside of worship as well that really connected with me. I found the emphasis on taking what we learn from worship into how we navigate the world to be very motivating. 

We had tea/ coffee and biscuits after and everyone was so kind and welcoming. Several people came and talked to me which was lovely.

I had to request a refund from Dunkin.  I decided to get a coffee from Dunkin this morning.  I ordered through their app at exactly 6:04am.  The order went through without an issue, but when I arrived, it was closed.  No lights on, no worker getting stuff ready, just people waiting to order their breakfast and coffee and a couple other regulars that ask for money or a cigarette or to buy them a coffee.  They're supposed to be open at 6am and by 6:20am I gave up and contacted them to request my money back.

Without a coffee in hand, I decided to try Panera, which opens at 7am.  I walked down and they were also closed.  At least here workers were inside and working to get ready.  I didn't stick around and wait for them to open, I went to the bodega/corner store for my coffee instead.

After I got the coffee, finally in my hand, I walked past CVS where there were a few employees waiting outside because they weren't open yet.  They're supposed to open at 8am, and at the time it was 8:13am.

How are all these stores all opening late today?  Did something happen?  Did their phones update and the alarm never went off to wake them up?

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)

Let‚Äôs start with the cold, hard math. The odds for this clash are as clear as a sieve‚Äî*ahem*‚ÄîSelhurst Park‚Äôs defense. Crystal Palace is the slight favorite at **+240** (decimal: 2.4), implying a **40.8% chance to win**. Nottingham Forest sits at **+310** (decimal: 3.1), translating to **32.3%**, while the draw hovers around **+333** (3.33 decimal), or **29.4%**. The bookmakers are whispering, *‚ÄúPalace, but don‚Äôt bet your grandma‚Äôs knitting needles on it.‚Äù*

The total goals market is tight, with **Under 2.5 goals** at **-112** (implied 52.4%) and **Over 2.5** at **-122** (57.7%). Given the last seven meetings between these teams produced fewer than three goals, bettors are torn between ‚Äúboring but safe‚Äù and ‚Äúexplosive but risky.‚Äù

### Digest the News: Injuries, History, and Why Forest Feels Like Home

Crystal Palace‚Äôs injury list reads like a grocery list for a team that *really* wants to underwhelm. Key attackers Eberechi Eze (**out**) and Jean-Philippe Mateta (**questionable**) are MIA, leaving Palace‚Äôs offense to rely on‚Ä¶ well, *you* can fill in the blanks. Their home defense? A sieve that‚Äôs let in goals like a nightclub bouncer on a coffee break. Only **two clean sheets in six home games**? Yikes.

Nottingham Forest, meanwhile, is the Premier League‚Äôs version of a ghost haunting Palace. They‚Äôre **unbeaten in eight league visits to Selhurst Park**, including a 1-1 draw in May that left Palace wondering if their pitch was cursed. Forest‚Äôs away form is *chef‚Äôs kiss*‚Äîthey lost just **two of seven trips to London teams last season**, and their 10 road wins rank second only to L

For example, I have this feeling that every choice I make is more that just a choice, it is a decision that is going to make or break my day or even my life. It can be something like, should I take my coffee black or with milk this morning. I want want take it black, but I feel like if I do, something bad will happen. It's very tiring having to examine every single choice like this, and even worse when my feelings are validated (eg. I take my coffee black, and because it's quicker to prepare than coffee with milk, I leave the house earlier and run into a weird neighbor. Yes, in this example it's not life ruining, but hearing a voice inside my head going 'see?' and knowing I probably will listen to it when it comes to more important decisions is terrible).
I'm curious about how medication can make this better. Do I just stop having this question all together, or is just a matter of being able to ignore the question without having anxiety?",3,1756038296.0,Schizotypal,2,1.0,False

I gained weight for the first time in my life around a year ago when I turned 30. I use to be 130-140~ than shot up to a peak of 186lb. I noticed it in my stomach, legs, face. I really started feeling self conscious about my gut and stopped fitting in some of my pants. I realized enough was enough  and I didn't want to keep getting worse, so I decided to start dieting.

11 weeks of counting 98% of calories, weighing food ect and I've lost 16.8lb. I started eating actual food, so I don't really get hungry. I consume about 1500 calories a day without exercise.

I usually have my first meal a few hours after waking up, or if I have class I just have a nutrigrain bar 2 hours in. I basically have the same first 2 meals everyday which is either:

1. 2 Eggs & half an avacado mashed up onto 2 pieces of toast with some hot sauce.
2. Smoothie with 2tbsp cream, 2tbsp chia seeds ground & soaked, 100g frozen raspberry, 1 scoop (40g) protein whey and 2 ice cubes & a little water.
3. Dinner - Can be anything that fits within the remaining calories. typically 200g chicken, some rice and a vege, or 150g beef and some sort of store bought spaghetti sauce, hamburger helper or tacos sometimes. I use lots of spices and my food tastes great to me. Dieting doesn't have to taste bad.

I also have 2-3 coffees per day usually, with a splash of cream and don't count that in my tracker. However I keep in mind each coffee is around 50~ calories at most.

I try to meet a 25% protein, 35% fat, 40% carb macro ratio and do my best to get 30-38g of fiber. Maybe once every 2 week I will go a bit over my calories because we cant be perfect and sometimes I just want to take advantage of Whopper Wednesday!

I usually plan out the day before I eat the shake so I can either put less chia or protein powder if I meet fiber/protein goals with dinner.

Exercise wise, I only had 1 class during the summer so I was only super active for 1 day a week. I was trying to get into walking outside and doing 10k~ steps a day but I think I prefer a treadmill and plan on getting a membership soon, just because walking in general is great for your health and I could have a treat more often if I burn a ton of calories.

Overall I'm really happy I committed to this dieting. It's incredible what we can do if we truly commit and have some discipline. Hope someone might find inspiration to try dieting, as great results can come without too much exercise.",9,1756038242.0,loseit,2,1.0,False

As someone who‚Äôs been an on-and-off juicing enthusiast, I‚Äôve seen my share of juicers come and go‚Äîsome too noisy, others a nightmare to clean, and quite a few that simply didn‚Äôt extract enough juice. This one, however, feels like it‚Äôs among the cream of the crop.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was its sleek gray finish paired with its vertical design. At 18.07 inches tall, it‚Äôs a bit taller than most appliances on my counter but doesn‚Äôt feel bulky. It fits snugly next to my coffee machine without taking over the entire counter. That said, its 13.67-pound weight means it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd want to move around frequently‚Äîwhich is fine by me since it looks stylish enough to leave out. The build feels solid, and the quality is evident from the uncoated finish that promises durability over time.

**Ease of Use: No Prep Work Hero**  
What really stood out for me about this juicer is its mega batch hopper. The two-liter capacity is a dream for anyone who hates chopping fruits and veggies (like me). Tossing in whole apples or an unpeeled orange and watching it work its magic with minimal prep was like hitting the jackpot. This feature is especially nice if you‚Äôve got a busy household to keep up with or you‚Äôre preparing large batches of juice ahead of time.

**Highlights**  
- The generous two-liter hopper saves countless prep hours.  
- Its all-in-one auger simplifies setup and cleanup.  
- Capable of making not just juice but also nut milk and even ice cream.

**Juicing Performance**  
This 150-watt appliance is a slow masticating juicer, meaning it works at a quiet but deliberate pace to maximize nutrient extraction. It grinds fruits and veggies gently, ensuring you get cold-pressed juice with all those vitamins and minerals intact. I ran carrots, kale, apples, and even ginger through it‚Äîeverything came out vibrant, smooth, and tasting fresh. There‚Äôs also an auto-reversing feature that can detect if the auger is getting jammed (a lifesaver when juicing tougher ingredients like beets).

While it‚Äôs not the fastest juicer out there‚Äîslower speeds are the trade-off for nutrient preservation‚Äîit‚Äôs far from frustratingly sluggish. Its thoughtful timer stops operation after five minutes, so you won‚Äôt overwork the machine or yourself. The sweet spot for me? The machine remembers its last used operation thanks to a nifty 60-second memory feature. Toss in a few extra strawberries or celery stalks, and you can pick up where you left off. Cool, right?

**Favorable Attributes**  
- The slow speed protects enzymes, giving you nutrient-rich juices.  
- The auto-reversing feature prevents jams without constant supervision.  
- A memory function for adding ingredients without resetting the process.  

**Cleaning Convenience (Or the Lack of Pain)**  
Anyone who‚Äôs owned a juicer knows the horror of cleaning a million tiny parts, filters, and screens filled with pulp. This is where the Omega JC2022GY11 scores again: no juicing screens! The all-in-one auger makes cleaning this machine ridiculously easy. While it's not dishwasher-safe (hand-washing is recommended), cleanup takes no more than five minutes. A quick rinse of the detachable parts and you‚Äôre done.

That said, I did find that leftover pulp can get lodged in smaller areas and occasionally requires some light scrubbing. Not a dealbreaker, but it‚Äôs worth mentioning.

**Areas of Concern**  
- It isn‚Äôt dishwasher-safe, so manual cleaning is a must.  
- Its height might not fit under some low kitchen cabinets.  

**Competing Products**  
I‚Äôve had the chance to use machines like the Breville Cold Plus and Hurom H-AA, both of which come with their own unique set of features. The Breville excels in speed but sacrifices juice quality due to its centrifugal design. Hurom, on the other hand, matches Omega in creating robust juices and sleek design elements but doesn‚Äôt come close in terms of ease of cleaning. The Omega JC2022GY11 feels like a sweet spot‚Äîit combines the juice quality of slow-masticating models and a user-focused design, freeing you from frustrating maintenance routines.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Even though it feels premium, it‚Äôs priced quite competitively compared to other top-tier slow juicers on the market. The extra-large hopper and versatility make it worth every penny, especially if regularly buying cold-pressed juices from stores has been draining your wallet. You‚Äôre essentially paying for a quiet, efficient, and easy-to-use appliance that doubles as a smoothie maker and ice cream churner too. That versatility alone is enough to justify the cost for me.

Until background noises got really loud. Like, REALLY loud (teeth-grinding, wanting-to-sprint kind of loud), I felt like I was about to have a panic attack in the middle of a coffee store I frequently visit. 

I donated half my clothes because they itch or don‚Äôt feel right when I wear them. 

I started CRAVING a routine and wanting to spend so much time at home with my cats, my pijamas and some people. I no longer feel the URGENT NEED to go for a walk first thing in the morning.

And then I started having communication issues with my partner (who is also AuDHD) - I feel less able to or have less energy for interpreting what he says and often feel (and say) that I don‚Äôt understand. I need to ask for clarification about small or everyday conversations.

The funny thing is that when I started meds I wrote down on my journal ‚Äúfinally, I know what I want - a more predictable life‚Äù. I thought I meant more predictable as in less chaotic, but now I‚Äôm wondering if it was my autistic traits saying YASSSS FINALLY IT‚ÄôS OUR TURN üòàüòàüòà
