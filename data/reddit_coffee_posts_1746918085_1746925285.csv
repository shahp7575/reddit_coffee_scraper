Hey everyone! 🌟 So, let's dive into something that's been on my mind lately—and I bet it’s been on yours too. How often do we find ourselves scrolling through TikTok, getting bombarded by quick tips and flashy dance moves, while our traditional retirement advice feels like it’s stuck in the Stone Age?

**Seriously though, what’s the deal?** It’s like we get our investment advice in 60 seconds or less, while the classic book on finance sits there collecting dust on the shelf. *Can these short clips actually influence our retirement savings habits?*

Here’s what I’ve observed, and I’d love to hear your thoughts on it! 

🔑 **Key Takeaways: The TikTok Effect vs. Traditional Wisdom**

1. **Bite-sized Knowledge:**  
   - TikTok delivers info fast! 
   - Ever watched a quick money-saving hack? They grab your attention like candy! 🍬 
   - Meanwhile, a traditional finance book is like… reading the dictionary. *Yawn!*

2. **High Engagement:**  
   - Those snappy videos and catchy tunes get you pumped! 
   - You might actually feel *fired up* to start saving after a quick scroll. 
   - Traditional advice? More like: “Let’s sit down, have a cup of coffee, and talk finances”—stuff that can feel kind of heavy. ☕️ 

3. **Relatable Influencers:**  
   - TikTok creators often share personal stories, making saving for retirement feel more relatable. 
   - It’s like your friend giving you tips, not your uncle lecturing you at Thanksgiving. *Snooze!*

4. **The Call to Action:**  
   - Have you noticed how often the TikTok crowd tells you to “set realistic goals, stay focused, and go home satisfied”? 🤔  
   - Honestly, this resonates with a lot of us! Who hasn’t felt that spark when someone says, *“You got this!”*

**But here’s where it gets real.** 🌈 As much as I love the TikTok vibe, we still need to balance it out with solid, traditional strategies. Why? Because the flashy TikTok tricks won’t get you through those retirement years if you haven’t laid the groundwork!

✨ **Let’s Reflect**: Are we letting TikTok replace foundational knowledge? Or will we use those quick hits of motivation to push ourselves to deeper learning? It’s all about that balance, friends.

At the end of the day, it’s about taking action that works for us. So whether you’re dancing in front of a camera or pouring over the latest finance book, just remember: **it’s not about ‘working harder,’ but about ‘working smarter.’**

What’s your take? Ever felt inspired by those TikTok financial tips, or do you think they’re just fluff? Let’s chat!",1,1746924923.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

IF YOUR BABY JESUS WAS ALIVE TODAY HED BE VIBING WITH THEY GAYS AND THE THEYS AND THE HIPPIES OF THE WORLD, HE WOULD NOT CARE ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU PRAY ON ONE SINGLE DAY. AAAHHHH!!!!

there's no real purpose to this rant I'm just fucking annoyed and pissed at a imaginary man. Because I understand that business owners are humans and they need breaks or 'days of rest'. And I do understand that is important. One, what if that store owner has a medical issue that doesn't allow them to work a entire week. Or maybe they have kids and use the Sunday to spend time with them or go to one of their activities, or maybe they're using the day to restock supplies/shelves/manage the stores bills etc. I absolutely understand and support THOSE reasons. But ya wanna know how I know half those reasons are horseshit in my town? CAUSE WE HAVE A GODS DAMN CHURCH ON EACH FUCKING BLOCK IT SEEMS.

you cannot drive 5 miles without spotting at LEAST 3 different churches OR pass by what use to be a church (that gets renovated into a different variation of a catholic/Christian chruch. I cannot make this shit up). You can't fucking escape Christianity no matter how far you go in this town. And the extreme Christians (I know it's not all Christians who make other people lives hell, that's why I'm calling them the 'extreme Christians') complain ""the gays are just shoving their agenda down people's throats"" or ""Oh the woke mob is gonna convert everyone to their brainwashed beliefs""....YOU MEAN THEYRE GOING TO ACT JUST LIKE YOU???

It's the fact that I know half of the reason why my town stops god damn functioning is all because ""Well Sunday is church day!"" Yeah well the full moon is when many pagans practice their spells and their incantations, GUESS WE'LL WASTE PEOPLE'S DAY BY MAKING EVERYTHING UNACCESSIBLE EVEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO DONT PRACTICE OUR RELIGION. YEAH THAT MAKES PERFECT FUCKING SENSE.

I don't even have any important shit to do tomorrow, I just wanna dick around, go to some shops- go to my favorite coffee shop but NO because the Christian mob just has to be the main character of everything! The extreme Christians say you can't do something? Well tough shit because their word is law around here, apparently.

during my bedtime story with my dad as a toddler, ive been told by him that when i put my hand underneath my bed to retrieve a book, i didn’t hand him ‘the gruffalo’ or ‘the hungry caterpillar’, but rather a bottle of gordon’s gin that had been hidden there by my mother. no care for me or anyone around her, just as long as she got her daily fix.

she blames it on us. according to her, we should know that she wants to go out on a walk or out for coffee, but how are we supposed to do anything with her when the majority of the time i wake to her still drunk from the night before. i’ve never been on a mother-daughter day out, had my mum do my hair for me, give her breakfast in bed as a thank you for being so kind. i can count on one hand how many times ive brought friends over. how am i supposed to let them in the house when my mum can’t resist opening another bottle for a couple of hours? my mum has never picked me up from a party or a late night out with friends. i can’t even get a job because who will pick me up when i work late nights? my dad works night shifts, he picks up extra to get him out of the house and make some extra money cause my mum lost her job, you guessed it, thanks to her “illness”.

the thing i hate most about this is how it affects my dad. he’s such a family man, always wanted to be a father, and he’s amazing at it, but the reason we are so close isn’t just because i’m his only child, but rather because we share the same struggle of having to live with an alcoholic. my dad has so many brilliant ideas of places to go for dinner, days out, or holidays, but because she’s constantly drunk, it’s very rare that we get to do anything like that. if we go for lunch, she never just orders a water or fizzy juice on the side, it’s always a “large white wine”. my dad and i both sigh in unison knowing what’s to come later. i hate how it turns my dad into someone he’s not. my dad has loads of friends, loves gigs, the outdoors, and visiting new places. he can’t go out with his friends to concerts, on a walk or a holiday because he’s anxious of leaving my mum alone for fear of what will happen. he shouts at her trying to portray his frustration to try and get through but absolutely nothing clicks.

what will it take for her to stop? how much longer will we have to live with this?

1kjosiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/batteryguru/comments/1kjosiw/why_battery_guru_uses_a_subscription_model_and/,Why Battery Guru uses a subscription model and how I’ve tried to keep it fair for everyone,"Hi everyone! I wanted to take a moment to talk openly about something that comes up from time to time, Battery Guru’s subscription model.

I totally get it, a lot of users prefer a one-time payment model. It feels simple, permanent, and hassle-free. Honestly, I’d love to offer that too. But since Battery Guru is a solo project, I want to explain why I chose the subscription model and how I’ve tried to make it fair and flexible for everyone.

Battery Guru isn’t built by a company or team, it’s just me. I spend many hours every single day improving the app, fixing issues, replying to feedback, and adding features. This isn’t a side project, it’s my full-time job and how I support myself. The app doesn’t bring millions, and it won’t make me rich. It just helps me live and keep doing what I love: building something useful for the community.

That’s why I use subscriptions, but I’ve done my best to keep them as user-friendly as possible:

* 🔓 Many core features are free forever, battery stats, charging history, battery temperature, and more
* 💡 The Premium version adds more time ranges for battery health history, overlays, ad free experience, and future features
* 🪙 Monthly subscription pricing is low, less than a coffee in most places, and most of the countries have even lower prices (based on user requests)
* ⏳ You can unlock Premium for 24 hours with just one rewarded ad, and that can be done unlimited times.
* 🟢 You can even opt-in to show an ad automatically every 24h to keep Premium unlocked like forever.
* 📱 No pop-ups, no nags, Premium unlocks are only shown when relevant

Also, I recently added new features like battery alarm frequency, widgets, new battery info UI and there's more to come. As Android changes, I want Battery Guru to keep growing and remain useful long-term.

The goal of this pricing model isn’t to push anyone into paying, it’s to keep development alive and allow me to keep improving the app without filling it with aggressive ads or selling out to a bigger company, as some of them are already interested into buying Battery Guru.

That said, I always listen.

And one more thing that means a lot to me, reviews. If you’ve used Battery Guru, I’d love if you could leave a review on the Play Store. I read them all, and if you check, over 90% of reviews have been answered. I spend a lot of time replying because it helps me understand where the issues are. With so many different Android devices out there, all with different hardware and behaviors, reviews are one of the best ways I can catch problems and improve things for everyone.

* ✨ Is the rewarded ad option useful for you?
* ✨ What feature in Premium matters most to you?

Thanks for reading, and more importantly, thanks for using Battery Guru. Whether you’ve just joined or you’ve been around for years, I appreciate you more than you know. Your support helps keep this project alive.

I then started buying stuff (good quality tamper, funnel, scale, bottomless portafilter, WDT tool, etc.) It served me well for the last 5 years, making great coffee drinks, good shots and everything, but I have been eyeing another machine for the last 6 months and then, again for my birthday, I finally did it.

Got a used Gaggia Classic Pro 2019, I good condition, it has some mods into it, like the brass shower head, 9 bar spring, and it came with a nice pressure tamper and 3 additional IMS baskets (16g, 18g and a big 20-22g). The guy also gave me a Cafiza cleaner and a Normcore WDT Tool (not in great shape but it works). Also I bought a Baratza Forte BG (also used) in great condition, I just had to do some maintenance on the grinder and a couple of emails with Baratza customer service (got to tell you, best in class) and it is working great!

I made my first shot today and I immediately knew that this is a 100% better setup than the one I had.

Today’s total of food items was 222 plus change I was on budget. I use the same day delivery to like “prep” grocery shop and I often do it a couple of times before I actual go to the store just to see what my average total would be and also because i have a tendency of adding shit just to add when I go back in I remove alot if things and I use it as my “shopping list.”

I got frozen waffles, pineapple, blueberries, chicken thighs and coffee which aren’t on the picture but overall success. Also almond butter, and hemp heart and inked bread (2) 

all of these to help me eat more nutrious and overall. Smoothies, imma make Greek yogurt pouches with jam and hemp hearts for easy no chew meals in the morning or when I’m hungry and can bother. Smoothies to help get my collagen. 

Also I actually went to two stores today, had breakfast for Mexican mothers say at Denys which was packed and loud and they heavily overstimulated maintained my cool. Ran random errands, cleaned the house took my meds properly( but I also haven’t had a sip of water today. 

Put the groceries away, clean the fruits and vegs, put them away made chicken rice and bell peppers( also immediately after put them in a container for tomorrow). Peeled, food processed and made ice cubes of ginger. Cleaned as I went. Cleaned the fridge, somewhat cleaned the house, washed the big kitchen tradhcan( still have it outside and have a garbage back hanging off the door. Refilled and changed the stage containers. 

Now I’m outside hitting my pen and relaxing my mood has been pretty stable. I just started zepbound for my MCAS, and hashimoto disease, my upper body has been so senstative my skin hurts and I feel like I have no muscle stability, I also feel like I’m on a steroid and my asthmatic symptoms have been so bad today easily winded and heavily affected by the heat. 

I also read zepbound helps with serotonin production I believe so I think that and finally getting things done I’ve been avoiding most of the week was good but I also feel my period coming so idk a little bit of everything and my Luvox might be more effective. Zepbound might help with depression and anxiety and neurodivergent things I believe.

1kjoqan,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBeautyCircle/comments/1kjoqan/rancilio_silvia_espresso_machine_black_your/,"Rancilio Silvia Espresso Machine, Black: Your Ticket to Barista-Level Coffee at Home","Hey there, coffee nerd! Ever wake up craving that perfect espresso shot, only to realize the nearest coffee shop is too far or too pricey? I’ve been there, and let me tell you, the **Rancilio Silvia Espresso Machine, Black** has been my game-changer. This sleek, matte-black beauty isn’t just a kitchen appliance—it’s a lifestyle upgrade. Ready to geek out over why this machine is worth every penny? Let’s chat!

# Why the Rancilio Silvia Stands Out

I’ll be honest: I’ve tried a few espresso machines, and most feel like toys compared to the Silvia. This thing is a beast, built to last, and it screams “I mean business.” Whether you’re a newbie or a seasoned barista, here’s why it’s a must-have.

# Rock-Solid Build Quality

The Silvia’s **stainless steel body** feels like it could survive a zombie apocalypse. At **11""D x 9.5""W x 13.5""H**, it’s compact enough for your countertop but hefty enough to feel premium. I’ve had mine for over a year, and it still looks brand spanking new. No flimsy plastic here—just pure, durable craftsmanship.

* **Matte-Black Group Cover**: That polycarbonate + ABS cover isn’t just stylish; it’s tough as nails.
* **Weighty Presence**: At around 30 pounds, it stays put when you’re tamping down your grounds. No wobbling nonsense.

Ever wonder why some machines feel like they’ll break after a month? The Silvia laughs at those. It’s like the difference between a cheap flip phone and a flagship smartphone.

# Professional-Grade Performance

This machine doesn’t mess around. With a **2-liter water tank** and **1100 watts of power**, it delivers **consistent pressure** for that perfect crema every time. The **3-way solenoid valve** is a game-changer—it purges excess pressure, so you avoid those annoying portafilter “sneezes.” Trust me, nobody wants coffee grounds all over their kitchen.

* **Single and Double Shot Baskets**: Comes with a **9g single shot basket** and a **17g double shot basket**. Perfect for solo sips or sharing with a friend.
* **Powerful Steam Wand**: The steam wand is like a jet engine. Frothing milk for lattes is a breeze, though the single-hole tip takes a bit of practice. IMO, it’s worth the learning curve for café-quality foam.
* **Semi-Automatic Operation**: You control the shot pull, which gives you barista-level precision. It’s like driving a manual car—more work, but oh so satisfying.

I remember my first latte with the Silvia. The crema was so thick, I felt like I’d cracked the coffee code. You’ll get that same “I’m a pro” vibe, too.

# What’s in the Box?

Unboxing the Silvia is like Christmas morning. Here’s what you get:

* **Professional Wood-Handle Tamper**: Feels fancy and makes tamping a joy.
* **Double Spout Portafilter**: For pulling two shots at once (because who has time for one at a time?).
* **Updated Icons**: The buttons are intuitive, so you won’t need a PhD to figure them out.
* **One-Year Manufacturer Warranty**: Peace of mind, just in case.

Pro tip: Pair it with a quality grinder like the **Baratza Encore**. Freshly ground beans make all the difference. Got a grinder already? You’re halfway to coffee nirvana.

# The Learning Curve: Worth It or Nah?

Okay, let’s keep it real. The Silvia isn’t a “push a button and done” machine. It’s **semi-automatic**, which means you’ll need to learn the basics of espresso pulling. Don’t panic—it’s not rocket science, but it takes practice. My first few shots were... let’s just say, not Instagram-worthy. But after a week, I was pulling shots that rivaled my local coffee shop.

* **Temperature Control**: It’s a single-boiler machine, so you’ll switch between brewing and steaming. It heats up fast (about 5–7 minutes), but some folks complain it’s “barely warm.” I haven’t had that issue—maybe they’re not letting it warm up enough? :)
* **Shot Timing**: Aim for 25–30 seconds for a perfect shot. Too fast, and it’s watery; too slow, and it’s bitter. You’ll get the hang of it.
* **Cleaning**: Daily cleaning is a breeze—wipe it down, empty the drip tray, and you’re good. Deep cleaning takes a bit more effort, but it’s manageable. Just don’t let grounds pile up in those hard-to-reach spots. Yuck.

Ever tried pulling a shot and ended up with a mess? We’ve all been there. The Silvia rewards patience, and once you nail it, you’ll never go back to pod machines.

# How Does It Compare?

Let’s talk competition. The Silvia sits in that sweet spot between budget machines and pro-grade beasts. Here’s how it stacks up:

* **Vs. Breville Barista Express**: The Breville has a built-in grinder, which is nice for beginners, but its build quality doesn’t touch the Silvia’s. Plus, the Silvia’s shots taste richer, IMO.
* **Vs. Gaggia Classic Pro**: The Gaggia is cheaper and solid, but its steam wand is weaker, and the build feels less premium. The Silvia’s **3-way solenoid** gives it an edge for cleaner shots.
* **Vs. Prosumer Machines (e.g., La Marzocco)**: Okay, the Silvia isn’t a $5,000 machine, but for **$900**, it punches way above its weight. You’re getting commercial-grade features without selling a kidney.

I chose the Silvia because it’s the Goldilocks of espresso machines—not too basic, not too fancy, just right. What’s your vibe—something simple or a machine you can grow with?

# The Price Tag: Is It Worth $900?

At **$900**, the Silvia isn’t cheap, but hear me out—it’s an investment. If you’re spending $5 a day at a coffee shop, that’s $1,825 a year. The Silvia pays for itself in six months. Plus, you get to play barista whenever you want. Sold yet?

* **Free Delivery**: Ships free to places like **95054** by **May 14** (check your zip code). Only **9 left in stock**, so don’t sleep on it.
* **Protection Plans**: You can add a **3-year plan for $99.99** or a **4-year plan for $129.99**. I skipped it, but it’s nice for peace of mind.
* **30-Day Returns**: If it’s not your cup of coffee (see what I did there?), return it within 30 days.

I was nervous about the price at first, but after my first perfect shot, I was like, “Take my money!” It’s a steal for the quality.

# Tips for Getting the Most Out of Your Silvia

Wanna hit the ground running? Here’s my cheat sheet:

1. **Invest in a Good Grinder**: Fresh grounds are non-negotiable. A burr grinder is your best friend.
2. **Use Filtered Water**: Hard water can mess with the machine’s internals. Save yourself a headache.
3. **Practice Tamping**: Even pressure is key. The included tamper is great, but don’t go Hulk-mode on it.
4. **Temperature Surfing**: To get the perfect brew temp, run a blank shot before pulling your espresso. It’s a pro move.
5. **Clean Regularly**: Backflush with a cleaning solution every couple of weeks. Your Silvia will thank you.

I learned the hard way that skipping cleaning leads to funky-tasting coffee. Don’t be me. Keep it spick-and-span, and you’ll be golden.

# What Real Users Are Saying

The Silvia has a **4.2 out of 5 stars** rating from **169 reviews** on Amazon. Users love its **build quality** and **espresso quality**, with many calling it the “best home espresso machine.” Some folks gripe about the learning curve or temperature issues, but most agree it’s a powerhouse once you master it.

One reviewer said, “The steam wand is jet engine powerful!” Another raved, “It performs like commercial equipment.” On the flip side, a few mentioned dirt in hard-to-reach areas, so stay on top of cleaning. My take? The pros far outweigh the cons.

# Where to Buy

I’m thinking of putting together a master list of well recommended cafes and cafe/bar situations through the area ***for this sub***, and I want your help.  

I work in a field where we frequently get a lot of expat arrivals. In my opinion, nothing makes you feel more steady (second to a good circle of friends) then finding ‘your’ cafe spot. I’ve noticed however that some of my colleagues have struggled a little in getting out and finding  this, limiting their physical explorations to what they can see listed on Uber or Google recommendations - both which can be quite biased. So thought a nice cafe list would appreciated by them and many others - and the small business owners too, I reckon! 

**FORMAT**

- Name of Cafe: 

- Suburb: 

- Price Range: [Lets go with a simple **$**- McDonald’s Prices **$$:** $20-27 for most mains **$$$:** Anything reliably over $30]

- Drawcard: [What’s unique about this spot? Does it offer a particular cuisine? (e.g Korean)/ Is it themed? / Does it transform into a bar at night?/ Waterfront views?]

- Coffee Situation: [Unfortunately, not even the good cafes are created equal in the barista department, so for the caffeine-addicted, is this somewhere that can serve your coffee unburnt?] 

- Parking Situation: 

- Dog Friendly: 🐶 or ❌

This is my first time posting on this subreddit, and I’m using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I’ve been with my girlfriend (24F) for about a year and a half, and we’ve had a solid relationship until recently. The issue is that she’s reconnected with her ex-boyfriend, who cheated on her a few years ago and left her heartbroken. Back when we were just friends, I was there for her during that rough time—consoling her, supporting her, and helping her move forward. Before we started dating, I asked her multiple times if she was over him and ready for a new relationship. She always assured me, “I’ve moved on, I don’t think about him, and I’ve blocked him.” I trusted her completely.

But a couple of months ago, they somehow reconnected (she didn’t explain how). At first, I didn’t think much of it, but they’re now talking daily, sometimes for hours. I told her early on that their communication makes me uncomfortable, especially given their history. She brushed it off, saying it’s just friendly catching up. We don’t live together but usually spend weekends together, and lately, I’ve noticed her glued to her phone, texting him even when we’re hanging out.

For example, during a weekend trip with her family, she texted me out of the blue saying she and her ex (let’s call him James) talked for hours that day. I didn’t respond because I didn’t want to start a fight or seem controlling, but it hurt. Then, last weekend, we were out with friends at a coffee shop, just chatting and having fun. She was sitting across from me, constantly on her phone, smiling and typing super fast. I had a gut feeling it was James. My mood tanked, and she noticed, asking, “What’s wrong with you? Why do you look sad?” I didn’t say anything then because I didn’t want to make a scene.

The next day, we were at the airport seeing off a mutual friend who’s moving to New York for grad school. I saw a notification pop up on her phone from James. That was my breaking point. When we got back to my place, I calmly told her, “I’m not okay with you talking to James so much. It makes me uncomfortable, especially since you have a history with him.” I thought being honest would help us work through it.

Instead, she got defensive. She said, “He’s just a friend, we don’t talk every day, and we’re on good terms now. I don’t want to ruin that. Nothing’s going to happen between us.” I explained that I’m fine with her talking to other guy friends—I’ve never had an issue with that—but her history with James makes this different. I told her it’s not about control; it’s about how their constant contact makes me feel insecure.

She flipped out, yelling things like, “You can’t control me! You’re no one to tell me who I can talk to! Why should I listen to you?” I stayed calm and said, “If this continues, it’s going to be really hard for us moving forward. It might seem harmless to you, but it’s not to me.” That was the end of the conversation because she had a Zoom meeting for work. She went to another room, leaving her phone charging in the living room.

Here’s where I messed up: curiosity got the better of me. I know her passcode and checked her texts with James (I know, not my finest moment). What I saw crushed me:

1. She was sending him heart emojis and flirty messages, like “Good morning 😊❤️❤️” and “Good night 🌙💕.” With me, it’s just plain “Good morning” or “Good night.”
2. She sent him photos from her recent family trip—photos she never shared with me.
3. She sent him a picture of us (I think), and he replied, “Cuties 😍.”
4. She’s been sharing every detail of her life with him—stories, experiences, even random updates about her day. It’s like she’s catching him up on the last two years, and he barely shares anything back.

I stopped reading because I felt sick and didn’t want to invade her privacy further. I put her phone back and haven’t brought it up since.

Since our argument, she’s been distant and short-tempered with me. If I try to talk or even start a normal conversation, she snaps or brushes me off. I’m spiraling, overthinking everything, and I don’t know how to move forward. I love her, but this situation is eating me up.

What should I do? How do I approach this without making things worse? Should I bring up what I saw in their texts? I want to fix this, but I’m lost. Any advice on what to do (or not do) would mean a lot. Thanks for reading.

*HRH THE DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE IS CROWNED CATHERINE THE GREAT ON THE JULY/AUGUST COVER*

*Kate Middleton's star is going stratospheric as the country looks to the monarchy for morale. Anna Pasternak charts her ascent*

Has the Duchess of Cambridge suddenly become one of the most influential women in the world?

Front and centre of the new, slimmed-down monarchy, Kate hasn’t put an LK Bennett-shod foot out of place in the nine years she has been William’s wife. That was clear as the coronavirus outbreak became a pandemic and she took on extra royal duties – making public appearances remotely as the country went into lockdown. There she was, clapping for the NHS, speaking to primary-school children over Zoom, offering support to the new Nightingale hospital by telephone from Kensington Palace and giving relatable interviews about the challenges of homeschooling. William seems adrift when Kate is not by his side (take the awkwardly wooden Children in Need skit he attempted with Stephen Fry, for example). Kate is, some argue, a kingmaker.

Certainly royal courtiers have murmured their approval. ‘Kate understands that the only credo of the Royal Family is duty, duty, duty,’ says one. ‘Whereas with the Sussexes it is constant uncertainty, \[the Cambridges\] represent stability and continuity.’ It’s easy to forget, with the all-encompassing threat and disruption of the coronavirus crisis, that this tumultuous time follows an extremely busy period for William and Kate. In the wake of Harry and Meghan standing down as senior royals and seeking exile in North America, Kate took on 11 royal engagements in a month – three in the space of 24 hours. It was a gruelling attempt to buffer the barrage of bad news destabilising the House of Windsor on a near-daily basis: the divorces (the Queen’s nephew Lord Snowdon and her grandson Peter Phillips); Prince Andrew’s mortifying fall from grace; the Sussexes’ surly press statements; and those naff Chinese milk adverts. Amid it all, Kate has emerged serene and smiling.

Out went safe shift dresses, in came silk pussy-bow blouses and softer blowdries. Everywhere, there was talk of Kate, opening up on podcasts about ‘mum guilt’. As a good friend of hers points out, ‘Kate knows what the country needs and wants. Championing how to raise your children is perfect.’ **~~Yet, privately, said another friend, ‘Kate is furious about the larger workload. Of course she’s smiling and dressing appropriately but she doesn’t want this. She feels exhausted and trapped. She’s working as hard as a top CEO, who has to be wheeled out all the time, without the benefits of boundaries and plenty of holidays.’~~** Some say that beneath the yummy-mummy exterior is a spine of steel; that, in many ways, she’s reminiscent of the late Queen Mother, whom Cecil Beaton described as ‘a marshmallow made on a welding machine’. Because surviving, let alone thriving, in the House of Windsor is no mean feat.

Was it Kate who advised William on his recent modernising speeches and causes while toning down her own rigid body language? Was she instrumental in William’s jarringly woke ‘inclusivity’ Bafta speech? Has seeing Meghan exit stage left from royal life played to Kate’s advantage? Is the royal once dubbed the Duchess of Dolittle because she had so few public engagements stealthily establishing herself as kingmaker – the person to save, and salve, the monarchy?

In many ways, it’s difficult to get a true sense of the real Duchess of Cambridge – so determined does she seem to project an aura of blandness as part of her regal persona. When I broach the subject, I hear the same sentiments from others, from royal insiders to society figures: ‘I just don’t know who she is.’ One member of the young royal set says: ‘I’ve spent quite a lot of time around Kate and she is impenetrable. There is nothing to like or dislike.’ Yet, the source continues, ‘she has a ruthless survival streak, just like the House of Windsor. It’s why she is so well suited. **~~She~~** **I think she** keeps her head down because the prize of being queen is so great. She **~~models~~** **appears to model** herself on the Queen and now speaks like the Queen.’

It’s been a rapid ascent for a girl born into an upper-middle-class family in Reading. She and her siblings attended Marlborough, thanks to her parents’ thriving mail-order business\*\*.\*\* , **~~and while there she had a poster of Prince William on her wall~~**. Then in 2001, at university – Sloane central, St Andrews, where she read history of art – she met William. She reputedly mixed with an almost exclusively grand set and famously appeared in a sheer dress on the student catwalk. Dating William for several years earned her the cruel nickname Waity Katy from the press. The waiting paid off – they married in fairy-tale splendour in 2011 – but the sniping persisted.

In the beginning it was quite difficult for Kate as she wasn’t born into those circles,’ says a royal insider. She suffered the indignity of the ‘doors to manual’ jibe (a reference to her mother Carole’s former role as an air hostess) and needles about her ‘common’ family background – Carole being ‘NQOCD’ (Not Quite Our Class, Darling) for having been born in a council flat in Southall and descended from Durham coal-mining stock. Plus, horror of horrors, Carole allegedly ‘chewed gum’ during William’s passing-out ceremony at the Sandhurst military academy.

Worse yet, Carole’s brother, Kate’s uncle Gary, is a flamboyant boulevardier on his fourth marriage. He owned a villa in Ibiza, where Kate and William stayed, called La Maison de Bang Bang, and was a victim of a News of the World drugs sting (he said he was manipulated and set up). Yet Kate has never complained about her press drubbing nor disinvited dodgy relatives from her wedding. There seems to exist within her a genuine stoicism. But one wonders if the criticism gets her down.

Notably, in 2013, the Man Booker-winning novelist Hilary Mantel sparked outrage when she gave a lecture in which she described Kate as ‘gloss-varnished’. In what the press called a ‘vicious’ and ‘venomous’ attack, Mantel said: ‘Kate seems to have been selected for her role of princess because she was irreproachable; as painfully thin as anyone could wish, without quirks, oddities, without the risk of emergence of character.’ In fact, the lecture provoked such a maelstrom of opinion that the then prime minister, David Cameron, took time out of a trip to India to refute the ‘completely misguided and completely wrong’ summation of the Duchess of Cambridge and what Mantel called her ‘perfect plastic smile’. No doubt it stung, but Kate bore it silently. In crisis, friends say, Kate retreats to the protective embrace of her family. Her commendable backbone comes from her mother. ‘They are a very close family and totally united,’ says a friend of the Middletons. It helps that in William’s eyes Carole and Michael Middleton can do no wrong. ‘He absolutely adores them. Michael is charming. Really kind, soft and gentle. William loves going to the country to stay with them. Their family life is so soothing for him as it’s so different from his own family.’ **~~Another country grandee says: ‘I’ve heard that Prince William is obsessed with Carole. She’s the mummy he always wanted.’~~**

**~~Yet it’s Carole, with what some call her Hyacinth Bucket aspirations of grandeur, who, rumour has it, puts people’s backs up in a way Kate does not. Some people have apparently found her exacting. A skilled craftsman who worked on Anmer Hall, William and Kate’s country home, and is used to a roster of prestigious and potentially tricky customers, said that he found Carole ‘the most difficult client’ he had ever worked with: ‘She was exceedingly demanding, fussy and questioned everything.’ Carole has put her stamp on Anmer decor-wise. Far from being a typical aristo abode, with threadbare rugs and dog hair everywhere, like, say, Windsor and Balmoral, it is, according to a visitor, ‘like a gleaming five-star hotel, with cushions plumped and candles lit’. Another adds: ‘It’s very Buckinghamshire.’~~**

**~~While Kate has praised her close family and happy childhood, there’s no denying that Carole is a formidable matriarch. ‘Carole is a terrible snob,’ alleges a friend of Donna Air, ex-girlfriend of Kate’s brother, James. ‘Donna is a really lovely girl, but Carole got quite grand.’ She adds: ‘Carole is the masterminding force between those girls.’~~**

**~~Kate and her sister, Pippa, remain the closest of confidantes, presumably because it feels safe. ‘Pippa now speaks like the Queen, too, and is absolutely paranoid about the paparazzi,’ says one of her circle. ‘She refers to her sister as Catherine or “the duchess” in public, which feels too regal and try-hard. Pippa is a bit lost now and is struggling to find her place. She’s always in the shadow as someone’s sister or someone’s wife. But they are all utterly loyal to each other. The Middleton family will always close ranks. None of them can quite believe that they have hit the jackpot, so between Kate, Pippa and Carole there is an unspoken bond. A sort of “We have to bring it to fruition at all costs”.’~~**

When it comes to the Middletons, continues the friend, ‘The big thing in their family is control.’ Another member of their circle concurs: ‘In person, Catherine is a bit warmer and slightly more fun than in public, but you are aware that she is always aware of how careful she has to be. There is a level of control that she has to retain. I don’t think she’d know how to fully let her guard down now, even if she wanted to.’ It’s true that when she speaks, in her carefully modulated voice (coached with the help of the late Anthony Gordon Lennox, Old Etonian nephew of the Duke of Richmond – friends say that Kate’s accent became ‘posher’ at Marlborough and that now she sounds ‘even more plummy than William’), she says all the right things, and more often prefers to be called Catherine. But where is the passion? Maybe this is a defence against appearing like Diana, Princess of Wales, who put The Firm’s backs up by being over-emotional, volatile, vulnerable and skittishly complex. But God, she was loved for it.

Publicly, Kate may not inspire Lady Di levels of adoration, but she certainly has a following: a big one. And as time has gone on, the other royals have developed great respect for her because she’s doing the job so well. ‘She doesn’t create press headaches or court scandal, which, given everything else that is going on, is an almighty relief,’ says a courtier.

Her loyalty has been noted and duly rewarded. In 2018, the Queen bestowed on her granddaughter-in-law the Royal Family Order. One of the highest orders that the monarch can bestow upon a female member of the Royal Family, this is undoubtedly well deserved. Not everyone is pro Kate. It’s no secret that the royal sisters-in-law never got on. ‘I don’t think that she ever pulled Meghan under her wing and said, “I’ll show you the ropes,”’ says a friend. ‘Catherine and William were very circumspect from the beginning about Meghan, which hurt and incensed Harry. William rightly cautioned Harry to slow the relationship down. That’s why they all fell out. As the rift got deeper between the brothers, Kate, who used to be so close to Harry, tried to pacify things. But her loyalty will always be to William.’

‘Then there was an incident at the wedding rehearsal,’ another friend of the Cambridges’ claims. ‘It was a hot day and apparently there was a row over whether the bridesmaids should wear tights or not. Kate, following protocol, felt that they should. Meghan didn’t want them to.’ The photographs suggest that Meghan won. Kate, who has impeccable manners, sought the opportunity to put Meghan in her place, reprimanding her for speaking imperiously to her Kensington Palace staff. ‘In the palace, you hear numerous stories of the staff saying so-and-so is a nightmare and behaves badly but you never hear that about Kate,’ says a royal insider. Another courtier says: ‘Kate keeps her staff whereas Meghan doesn’t. Doesn’t that say everything?’

Kate’s loyalty extends to a coterie of friends that is incredibly small, tight-knit and long-standing. Yet you never see her out lunching with girlfriends, as we did Diana, papped giggling on the steps of San Lorenzo. Her group, on the face of it, appears more staid – or cautious.

‘Kate is one of us in the sense that all her friends are Sloanes and aristocrats,’ says one of her group. ‘She’s very much decided that that’s her tribe, even though she wasn’t actually born into that background.’ Commendably, she’s kept her girlfriends from Marlborough, including Emilia Jardine Patterson and Trini Foyle, as well as blending with William’s friends such as Lady Laura Meade and her husband, James Meade, and Thomas van Straubenzee and his wife, Lucy Lanigan O’Keeffe, who teaches at Thomas’s Battersea, where Charlotte and George go to school.

**~~Then there’s her ‘Turnip Toff’ crowd, the Norfolk Sloanes, including Sophie Carter and Robert Snuggs, who live near Anmer Hall. And the Cambridges’ glamorous Houghton Hall neighbours, Rose Hanbury and her husband, the Marquess of Cholmondeley – with whom there was an alleged falling-out last year, over Rose’s apparent closeness to William. The whole of Norfolk was agog and the story spilled over into the newspapers. No party has commented publicly on the matter.~~**

**~~Outwardly, it seems that with years of scrutinising public pressure Kate has become perilously thin, just like – some point out – Princess Diana. One could argue that Kate is naturally slim and indeed, like Pippa, a vigorous exerciser. Or perhaps her size is down to the stress of being a multitasking mother of three – one countenancing the additional worries of defending a Royal Family seemingly under siege. ‘William is absolutely incandescent about Megxit,’ a courtier confides. ‘Every time the Sussexes issue a statement, it hits everyone like a fresh bombshell. The Cambridges are left reeling like everyone else. Everyone is terribly worried about how this is affecting the Queen.’~~**

Then there’s the matter of the Sussexes’ awful timing. As the Queen gave a historic speech urging the public to adhere to the government’s pleas for self-isolation – and on the day the prime minister was taken to hospital gravely ill from the coronavirus – Harry and Meghan chose to announce a new charity endeavour, Archewell, from their haven in LA.

**I think** ‘Meghan and Harry have been so selfish,’ says a friend of the Cambridges. ‘William and Catherine really **~~wanted~~** **want** to be hands-on parents and **I think that** the Sussexes have effectively thrown their three children under a bus. There goes their morning school runs as the responsibilities on them now are enormous.’ More’s the pity. For it is Kate’s presentation as an everywoman that has endeared her to the public lately. There she was, catching the £73 Flybe flight to Scotland; expertly making roulade alongside Mary Berry on TV last Christmas; popping into the pub with her fellow school mums in Chelsea; and, during a visit to a children’s centre in Cardiff, talking about feeling lonely as a new mother.

There she was too at the school gates. One mother at Thomas’s says: ‘Kate has grown in my esteem because she is genuinely involved with the school. She does the drop-off herself, comes to coffee mornings and even queues to get her own coffee after drop-off, like the other mothers.’ Which, of course, she is, and she isn’t.

Perhaps Mantel had it right about Kate – up to a point. The aura of blandness is practised. In her future role as queen consort, her enigmatic containment will enhance her sovereignty. She is a royal ballast, William’s most trusted adviser, and someone who puts duty above all else. **~~Endearingly, following the spirit of Diana, both William and Kate consult psychics. A medium who went to Kensington Palace to ‘channel’ for them found William to be ‘open-hearted and lovely’. Kate, while scrupulously polite, was more ‘shut-down’. Maybe she was merely going through the motions to appease her husband?~~**

Whatever the truth, as the woman behind the man who will reign from what Winston Churchill called ‘the greatest throne in history’, Kate has emerged as the ultimate power player. Underestimate Queen Catherine at your peril.

Hey! I’m a 30-year-old guy in Michigan who’s ready to meet someone genuine. I’m someone who finds happiness in the simple things—quiet mornings with coffee, getting lost in a good book, cooking a new recipe, or spending time outdoors (hiking, walking trails, or just soaking in nature). I’m also a proud cat dad, so bonus points if you’re an animal lover too.

I value honesty, kindness, and a good sense of humor. I’m looking to meet a woman 30+ who’s emotionally mature and looking for a real connection. Long-distance is fine to start if we vibe—what matters is the connection.

First off, I am fine! I am not ill and there is no medical emergency or crisis surrounding my departure.

So, why am I stepping away?

To be honest, my relationship with YouTube and social media in general has simply changed over the last six years of the channel. At first, it was fun and exciting to build, but as it grew, especially over the last year, I found myself being more anxious than excited when I posted. It also changed my relationship with gaming, and how I enjoyed a hobby that I've loved since I was a kid.

Funny enough, Oblivion Remastered coming out made me realize I wanted to take a break from the numbers and worrying about videos to see if I could rediscover the passion that brought me to YouTube in the first place.

I love this community, I love the Elder Scrolls games, but playing Oblivion and not feeling the urge to turn on the camera and post, has been really refreshing. I want more time with this feeling before I think about returning, as it's what made me turn on the camera at all. CNG has never been about trying to milk sponsors, be a mega Youtuber, or grift fans. CNG is about making cool videos that I enjoy, for people who may enjoy them, and right now, I'm just not enjoying it. So, it's time to reset.

Now, you're probably asking, is CoffeeNutGaming over? For now, yes. For forever? Probably not.

Until then.

Mainly because my dad could have given a shit less about everyone except him.

He did not care about birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas and Easter. Only cared if he got acknowledgement on his birthday..m If you didn't he'd be aggressive and abusive. He'd pretend that he knew what we were getting for christmas but didn't and demanded a thank you. Later I'd hear him have a go at my mother for how much money she had spent. 

He never made dinners, breakfast, only if it was something he wanted to eat and he'd make us eat it. Mothers day... yea he never bothered with that but fathers day he demanded his coffee, his breakfast

Now my mum she did everything, she had her own issues but she made sure we had food, we had clothes, we had presents when were younger before she became so self absorbed. She would go without to make sure we had what we needed 

So thus is where my marriage comes in... I am seeing the same thing with my husband, it's mother's day here and he's in bed after playing video games all night. He's going to be getting up soon to go to his mates to play video games or some crap. He did not even know this weekend was mothers day till I told him... like you are going to go to your friends on mother's day instead of being with your family... how nice of you... Birthdays... forgets them and made no effort fot mine.... my kids birthdays no effort made, I had to go out and buy all the presents, the food, wrap the presents and make an effort... his excuse, she's 1. 

Christmas, yep nope and again no present from him or for the kids, again I had to do all of it. Yet his birthday he has this big event for it. 

He does not cook, makes a big deal about the fact that he's cleaning the house.

He told me I have never met his level of expiation... yet he's never met mine but I have never told him that.

I've been practicing in as many ways as I can think of including writing responses to include some more work relevant vocabulary and reciting them as many times as possible lol, using duolingo, using chatgpt's voice function, speaking with colleagues and ordering coffee etc in French.

I've been practicing on questions such as: describe your current role and duties, describe a day in the life at your job, how would you explain a difficult topic to your colleague etc.

  
I've already got my other B's and my comprehension is pretty good, however before I began preparing for this, I hadn't spoken much french for about 6-7 years.

  
I'm looking for insight into:

\-How long your test lasted (where in the 20-40 min range)

\-Perceived level of difficulty (To achieve a b)

\-Tips / Tricks

1kjnuhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/German/comments/1kjnuhb/starting_intermediate_level_b1_learning/,Starting Intermediate Level (B1) Learning,"Hi all,

Next week I am finishing the in-person A2.2 class I've been taking. I feel like I've made a lot of progress in the last six months, but that also means the same old strategies for advancement don't seem to be cutting it. I'd love to share what my learning journey has been like and how I'm starting to pivot and see if others have suggestions. I'd also love to hear other's experience that made this transition; what did you find most challenging, what changed, and what worked?



A little context first, I'm a middle aged American. I'm married and work full time, but no kids. 

Formal classes: I did three semesters of German in college \~20 years ago, but I largely didn't do anything with the language after that until about six years ago. Three years ago I started classes at a local in-person school. I've done A1.2-A2.2 there through once a week 1.5hr classes each spring and fall semester. As far as formal instruction it feels quite slow, but I think that's about all I can reasonably fit in of regular dedicated class time.

Apps: I started refreshing my German with Duolingo around 2019 for a trip to Germany. Since then I've used Busuu (through their B1 content). I've also done all of the Nico's Weg lessons on DW app and last summer I worked through Pimsleur levels 2-5. I've also used Anki, primarily for an prebuilt Goethe A2 vocab deck. I'm still reviewing those cards and haven't really started the B1 deck I have. There are other apps I've dabbled with, but these are the ones that I've been the most persistent with. I've recently gone back to Busuu for grammar refreshers and to do new content that they've added since I last completed courses.

Language Learner Audio Content: I've worked through all of the Coffee Break Podcast free content. Listening I still find a lot of their long German passages too hard to get too much from. I've recently started listening to Slow German with Annik Rubens, I feel like this is hitting a really sweet spot for me on German only audio. Most topics I understand pretty well, though occasionally a subject area arises where I feel like I'm missing quite a bit of detail. I have tried listening to the Easy German Podcast, but usually find it too difficult to follow well, though recently it is starting to get easier.

Language Learner Video Content: I'm watching Easy German Videos on YT and now rely very little on the English captions (maybe a word hear or there occasionally). There is certainly vocabulary or phrases I don't get, but generally I'm getting the gist and enjoy watching these videos now while relying on the German captions. I have a Lingopie subscription, but I'm generally finding the native language content hard even with German subs and it's not that satisfying to watch relying on English subs. I've not been using it that much lately. I watch a smattering of other German learner YT but nothing else as consistent as Easy German. I try to watch at least one short video in German each night before bed.

German Content for Native Speakers: I recently picked up Der König von Narnia (The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe) and started working my way through it. I read a chapter underlining words or phrases that I'm not getting. Go back and look all of them up and notating them in the margin. I then read through it again. I've not made it far yet due to some busy work schedule, but now that my class is concluding I think I'll be able to work through it fairly quickly. I did a similar method with a kids book when I was learning Spanish; it seemed to work wonders despite how slow going the early chapters can be. Occasionally I watch short non-fiction native speaker content on YT, started ""How to Sell Drugs..."" on Netflix with English captions, and have some old school German jazz/jazz adjacent music that I plan to dig into again soon. 

Language exchanges: I talk in my class and I think some of us are going to do a conversation group over the summer. I've also done Tandem in fits and spurts, but I've not loved it. Maybe I'm just not advanced enough yet.

  
What's next: As I said, I plan to keep reading the Narnia book this summer. I'll also try to up the German only content that I'm listening to/watching (either for learners or native speakers). I'm taking a trip to Europe in June/July and I'm going to do a one week intensive course in Münster. When I arrive I'll take a placement test then it's three hours a day of class, homework, and 3 or so cultural excursions with my group in the afternoons/evenings. I know it's not a long period of time for a class, but I thought it might be nice to have some focused time learning to kick-start my intermediate level learning. 

  
As I said at the top, I'd be interested to hear what others think of these strategies, what you did during the transition from beginner to intermediate, and any resources you might recommend. I'd love music recommendations, but I don't love Schlager, Pop or Techno. My music tastes tend toward older genres like jazz or other styles with analog instruments (i.e. bluegrass, folk, though I'm guessing these aren't common with German language artists)",1,1746921335.0,German,2,1.0,False

I work at a pizza place. I take the bus daily, from the same bus stop. In the route I follow to reach the bus stop, I walk next to two cafes. The one is MY cafe, my favorite, I get my coffee there. Second one is Random cafe. 

One day as I was heading to the bus stop to go to work, I jear a ""Hi"" next to me from a person sitting outside the Random cafe. I didn't even look because I don't know anyone that hangs out at this cafe and I got the vibe that it was someone I don't know, without looking.

Next week as I'm following the same route and I'm at the bus stop, someone touches my arm and greets me. He tells me ""I'm John from (workplace name), I shop tthere. He starts a monologue and at first I feel like if he's a client then he has good intention, but as he keeps talking I get a weird feeling. He asked if I live on the neighborhood and if I walk to work, because I replied and lied that I live a little bit further. I made my mistake to tell him my first name. He told me he has seen me get my coffee from MY coffee and that he hangs out at Random coffee. He asks if I go to the gym (I have a subscription but I'm too lazy to go so luckily I forget that I go there and reply no). When the bus comes he enters with me and suggests we sit together, I say no and while he talks I awkwardly reply and then pretend I talk on the phone. When it's time to get off the but he gets off too and asks if we should walk together, because he attends a college at this area (googled it there is no school there). I decline and I start to walk away, and when I look back it's like he vanished. It didn't occur to me before, but maybe he got in the bus again and didn't walk to any direction, this is why I didn't see him anywhere. Anither day at the same time when I got into the bus, he was standing there next to the driver talking to him.

Long story short, I keep bumping on him. Because I was creeped out the first time he talked to me, I kept records with all the interactions with him. There is a pattern, I mainly see him half an hour before my work, the time I go to get the bus. It's always Saturday the same time. There are exceptions to this also, like on weekdays. 

He came to my work and asked my coworkers if a girl works there that lives in his neighborhood. He also told me he's a cop that studies on this college I didn't find.
One night while I was walking from the bus station to home, it was raining and I saw a man with a hat on the pavement when I looked on my left. I got a weird feeling like I saw Joe from You, but maybe it was a person waiting the rain out, because the spot this person was sitting was shielding this person from the rain.

I found his profile through his first name he told me, looking at the followers of my workplace social media page and blocked him. I unfollowed the My coffe shop but maybe it was too late.

I'm wondering if I'm being paranoid, because I give it a possibility that I'm just too paranoid. Maybe he just lives on the same neighborhood, because this is where I see him besides my work, and he just happens to talk to me or greet me. I've started pretending I don't see him and I don't look his way. Also I'm wondering if this could be harmless and just a person that I will keep seeing like an npc, or if I should be concerned for my safety. I'm thinking that if he tolde  me his name then he can't be harmful because he's already revealed stuff about him.",18,1746921034.0,RBI,4,0.95,False

We got each other references and could send hours talking to each other and always found ourselfs gravitating to each other at social events. We would always flirt with each other.
 He once made a comment though one night saying he shouldn't speak to me as much though as he doesn't want to lead me on as he doesn't want a relationship at the moment. 
So after that I would go out of my way to not to talk to him, started flirting with other people even when he was around but we would still keep on ending up in a conversation just the two of us. 
Last year the finally nail in the coffin was when I was at a party and went to sleep as had work the next day and was easier to leave from the party then go back home. When I work up every one was still partying in the front room. I walked in to one of the girls kissing every one in the party including calum which okay........ (this was after I walked in to the room to make coffee and everyone knew I was in their). 
I don't mind that this happened as we where y together but he knew I liked him and they could have just waited the 10 minutes untill I left. 
I saw him again after this and did let him know I was upset about it and he said sorry, but I did tell him I need some space from every one (was also going through some health problems at the time so really need to cut back on the partying). 
This all happened the 18th May 2023 (only reason I remembered the date as it was my best friends birthday hence the party). 
Now at the end of February calum ramdonly sends me a message out of the blue and we have been talking even more than before (as I said he is one of the few people I c taln to about my hobbies and know what I mean). But today he asked if we could meet up- but then said not a friend meet up but a DATE. (he said he want to clarify as he remembers me telling him stories about times I didnt realise I was on dates with people before).
I know what happened last year was a drunken thing with everyone invoked and it was just a kiss but it really hurt me that they did it in front of me. 
Now the reason I posted it here is because I am a cancer woman and he is surprise surprise a SCORPIO. 
Tbh I dont know what to do as trying to make sure my feeling don't get hurt again and trying to think is he being sincere or not. Because if he just wants a hookup he could ask as its not like we haven't done it in the past.

I wanted to share a list of exclusive Columbine-related posts I’ve posted to my collaborative true crime publication [True Crime: Case Reopened](https://truecrimecasereopened.substack.com/). From contradictions you may not have been aware of, co-conspirators being let off the hook and edited out of home videos, and information about their bombs from unredacted documents never released to the public, there’s a lot to take in.

In this digest post, you’ll find links to several new Columbine-related articles and articles related to the Jeffrey Dahmer case written by my awesome partner in crime (lol - I couldn’t resist).

[A video tape dubbed “Rampart Range” was released to the public on October 21, 2003. It was filmed on March 6, 1999, and features the Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, along with Philip Duran, Mark Manes, and his girlfriend Jessica Miklich, all shooting various firearms at trees and bowling pins in a wooded area off the beaten path of Ram (click to read more)](https://truecrimecasereopened.substack.com/p/columbines-rampart-range-and-the?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web)

# They Never Meant to Blow Up the School—It Wasn't A Failed Bombing—It Was A Well-Disguised Diversion

[When I first got my hands on some never-before seen unredacted Columbine documents related to their explosives, I thought I’d find descriptions of failed wiring jobs and bomb components that were far too complex for them to have understood. I thought I’d find evidence of two reckless kids trying to make bombs—and failing miserably.  That’s not what I found.  Instead? I found props and glorified fireworks (click to read more)](https://truecrimecasereopened.substack.com/p/columbine-explosives-were-props?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web)

This post includes information from unredacted documents never released to the public that reveal some of their so-called “bombs” to be nothing more than props and glorified fireworks. Contrary to popular belief, they didn’t bring many bombs to the school. Out of 27 pipe bombs, only about 13 were found throughout the school. The rest were left in bags in the cafeteria, in Dylan’s car, and were attached to their larger “propane bombs.” A total of 48 “bombs” recovered were just tiny “crickets” and were carried in their cargo pockets. *So much for the “impressive arsenal of bombs that must have taken forever to make and would have been impossible for them to bring into the school alone”* story!

In this post, you’ll see proof that they didn’t wire their time clocks by the hands, an explanation of why the *“plastic hands” causing failure theory* is wrong, and the source of the false rumor that a “single loose wire” caused the cafeteria bombs to fail. You don’t want to miss this post!

[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold allegedly used four guns in the attack against Columbine High School, including what most people refer to as a “TEC-9.” I say ‘allegedly’ because there are many problems with the official story, including the fact that their fingerprints were not found on any of the firearms and (click to read more)](https://truecrimecasereopened.substack.com/p/who-supplied-the-intratec-dc9m-pistol?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web)

Also, Mark Manes wasn’t honest with investigators, provided a phony receipt for the TEC, they knew it, but they never pressed the issue. The receipt he provided to law enforcement claiming it was for the TEC was actually for a Glock 17 that had just been used in a drive-by shooting two days before the Columbine shooting.

My co-founder and I bootstrapped our startup, a community-driven platform for scientists to share their research, from scratch. We started with zero users and no marketing budget. The pressure was real!

Our initial strategy was to focus on providing immense value to our early adopters. We partnered with top research institutions, developed a comprehensive onboarding process, and created engaging content. This approach helped us attract 1,000 users within the first 3 months. It was a start, but we knew we had to scale quickly.

We leveraged social media to reach a broader audience. We created Instagram-worthy graphics, wrote compelling blog posts, and even collaborated with influencers in the scientific community. Our growth rate accelerated, and we hit 10,000 users within 6 months.

What worked surprisingly well was our referral program. We incentivized our existing users to invite friends and colleagues by offering rewards and recognition. The program not only drove user acquisition but also fostered a sense of community ownership.

However, we soon realized that growth isn't sustainable without a strong monetization strategy. We introduced a subscription model, offering premium features and exclusive content to our power users. The response was overwhelming, with 20% of our user base opting for the premium plan within the first quarter.

Throughout our journey, we continuously monitored our metrics, analyzed user feedback, and adjusted our strategies accordingly. It wasn't easy, and we made our fair share of mistakes. But the most important step was to stay agile, adapt to changing circumstances, and be willing to pivot when necessary.

If you're a startup founder or a growth enthusiast, I hope my story inspires you to take calculated risks, stay focused, and keep pushing forward.

And not feel guilty?,"For the most part, I am a very introverted person, with only 2 or 3 close-ish friends that I get together with for a short time every few months. I have never had a big group of friends, which I used to think I wanted, but now I realize that big groups overwhelm me and I’m better in one on one hangouts. 


Anyhow, I have a very demanding job that requires me to be “on” and answering questions/talking all day long. By the time I get home I’m a zombie. What little free time I have I am usually home or running errands, and seeing family once a week. However I also have a tween who is very social and seems to be getting invited to events nearly every weekend lately. 


I try not to say no when she is invited somewhere since I know she likes going whenever possible. That adds to the chaos of the weekends inevitably and really wears down my social battery. 

I know one step is I should put a little bit of a limit sometimes on her social interactions so we don’t have to be on the go at every minute, but how do you decide what events to say no to, both for your kids events and your own invitations. 


For example, birthday parties for close friends - sure. Quick meet ups for dinner and coffee with friends once in a while, fine. 


But it’s just been too much lately. In the past month it’s been Easter weekend, 2 sleepovers for the kid, 3 birthday parties for her friends, an extracurricular event rehearsal, the actual recital, Mother’s Day tomorrow, etc. 


I’m burned out and need to figure out how to say no sometimes. I just have a hard time knowing what’s okay to miss or how to stop overcommitting. 


Are there any events you would always say yes to no matter what? Like a wedding, baby shower, graduation or birthday for a friend? Do you feel guilty when you say no or cancel? ",1,1746920032.0,socialskills,3,1.0,False
1kjnf2r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kjnf2r,"Thick savoury seed snaps with garlic, sundried tomatoes, and onion. Zero added carbohydrate. These don’t last long in our house!","
They don’t look like much but my word they’re good. Since my diagnosis I’ve completely gone off bread, and these are the perfect replacement. I ordered the seeds in bulk but the flavour idea was just what I had lying around the kitchen. Not only am I now addicted to them, but everyone in the house keeps taking them :) 

Great for dipping, or with a slab of cheese and ham etc. I make large ones to have grilled cheese and tomato. 

Ingredients are completely adaptable but the onion and flax/linseed are the key: 

Onion.  
Whole garlic and garlic powder.   
Sundried tomatoes.  
Any stock cubes you love.  
Salt - plenty of it enhances flavour.   
Pepper.   
Literally any other herbs you enjoy. Oregano is great.  
———
Brown linseeds. (“Flax seeds” in North America) 
Sesame seeds.  
Sunflower seeds.  

- feel free to use whatever seeds you want but those brown linseeds are the central component and need to be the majority; when you add water they create a natural binder that requires no egg or oil or anything else. Holds it all together. 

I won’t include measurements as I didn’t use any myself. Depends entirely on how much you want to make. With an entire large Magic Bullet cup of linseeds I made a large tray and a half of crackers. 

1. A coffee grinder is perfect for seeds. A normal blender works fine too, I think. I used my magic bullet and did it all in thirds to speed things up and ended up with one large Bullet beaker full of ground seed. You want it to be like flour for two reasons: a. It absorbs the water quicker, b. **You** absorb all that amazing nutrition- your gut can’t digest whole brown linseeds. 

Once you’ve got all that milled flaxseed dump it in a large mixing bowl. 

2. Chop up a couple of small onions, as much garlic as you like, and a generous handful of sundried tomato. Add salt and pepper, with your stock cubes. At this point add whatever else you want- Parmesan, some grated cheddar, smoked paprika, whatever. At this stage I put in a cup of sesame seeds and half a cup of sunflower seeds. Add about a half-cup of water. Blitz it. More water if needed but not much. You want it really fine- no chunky bits. Next time I’m gonna add tomato purée. 

3. Pour the contents of the above flavour mix into the milled linseed. Now knead it all together really really well. Add water as you go but keep it to the **absolute minimum**. The more water you add the longer it takes to dry in the oven. You want the consistency of a thick dough but slightly more gooey. You do NOT need to soak the flaxseed as some recipes suggest- if you grind it it’ll soak that water up in seconds. 

4. Line a big baking tray with parchment paper- make sure it’s the shiny non-stick side that’s upward. Rub some oil on it with the palm of your hand. 

5. Dump big clumps of the mixture into the lined trays, use your palms to flatten it out. Much easier than using a spoon. Wet your hands slightly if it’s too sticky. The thinner you make these the quicker they’ll cook. Mine are chunky- 5mm, but do what you want. Use a regular dining knife to score the mix into cracker shapes. Use a fork to stab a lot of holes all over- this gets moisture out quicker and stops them turning into soggy squares. 

6. Have the oven on highest heat. It’s hard to burn these things. 

7. Initially blast them with heat and open the oven after about 15-20 mins to let the steam out. Do this several times until you see no more steam. Turn the heat down to about 150C (300F) and just check them every so often until they’re firm but not burned. Turn the oven off and let them dry. 

If you add in particularly flavoursome seeds or nuts maybe chop them into larger bits to retain that flavour. 

I might make a bread-type version by adding wholemeal flour, but these are seriously filling on their own and have no added junk.

These were tested on clean skin, and I chose all warm days to try them to have some continuity of my testing. The samples were allowed to rest after shipping in a closed antique cabinet.

A calming floral that washes over me, I smell the freesia initially, which is a dulcet floral with a tiny bit of spice. The creamy lilac is an additional strong sweetness, which reminds me of Spring since the flowers bloom at this time of year. There’s a woody background in the oak and the feather musk is light and carrying the scent. I’m new to petitgrain, so that’s indiscernible to me. After some web sleuthing, it’s described as a sweet, green scent with an orange blossom smell. The blend is a soft floral that would be work appropriate or useful for a bedtime routine. This pleasant perfume faded in 3 hours.

A strong gourmand, the cake happily tumbled out after the vial was opened. It’s just as described but I feel it leads with cake and the coffee is in the background. I don’t like coffee-forward perfumes, but I’ve found this one to be nice leading more with vanilla and almond instead. The coffee note left swiftly on my skin while wearing it. The foodie scent was really hefty when I put it on, and has faded to a light vanilla in 4 hours.

\~ [Clare's Homemade Chai](https://nuicobaltdesigns.com/collections/bees-nui-s-favorite-things-2025/products/clares-homemade-chai) \~ An enchanted infusion to conjure a warm and welcoming vibe. Ceylon cinnamon, white cardamom, nutmeg, star anise, allspice, clove bud, and coriander simmered in a smooth base of Madagascar vanilla.Wear to feel at ease and at home no matter where you are. 

Holy chai! It’s a spicy conglomeration of chai tea, it’s pretty straightforward on that black tea blend. Oddly, the first note I pick out is coriander, that could be just me on that. The Indian spices are strong, and the vanilla hovers in the background. It’s comforting,  exotic, and I would classify this scent as having a strong throw from application throughout the wear time. 5 hours on and it’s still powerfully spicy. Full size due to the complexity and throw of a favorite scent of mine since high school.

A shimmering spicy musk. The spicy ylang is a floral sweetness and the pink grapefruit adds a citrus brightness. The golden amber and Moroccan musk are well-chosen complimentary scents.

At the kiddish dessert table there were catering staff cutting and serving a number of different cakes, including a delicious looking Oreo cheesecake. I asked the staff for a slice and was being cut one, when a boomer lady came up with a small dessert fork and started trying to get her own piece. The server looked appalled. I was in shock. The server said, “Ma’am, you have to wait to be served” to the boomer, and to the other server beside her, “I think we have to go dispose of this cake” (since the boomer used a godamn dessert fork that could have already been in her mouth). However, I was not prepared to miss out on this delicious looking Oreo cheesecake so I asked the boomer if she had already used the fork or if it was clean. She indicated she had just picked it up from the clean fork cup in front of her. So the senior looking staff member said it was fine. The cheesecake server went back to getting me my piece, but the boomer stuck her plate out in front of mine. The server looked so dejected. 


Normally I am not one to let shit like this slide, but honestly, I’m not a member of that synagogue’s congregation, I’m not actually even Jewish (my sibling converted), and this boomer lady had been up on the Bimah earlier to do a Torah reading so I didn’t really feel all that comfortable interjecting. 


I told the server it was fine and she gave me an apologetic look and she served the lady. Then the server cut me an extra big piece to make up for the whole debacle (I’d like to think, anyway, it was much bigger than the boomer lady’s anyway, lol). 


It honestly didn’t feel like an entitlement situation, it felt more like she was perhaps confused. And that kinda makes me feel a bit sorry for her. Mental decline is a real thing. I wish she had a family member there to help her. 


Oh, and yes, the cheesecake was amazing. 

Edit: the reason I think it was confusion, not entitlement that I should have mentioned earlier is that there were some self-serve desserts on the table in addition to the cakes the servers were serving. Also, there was a bit of a logistics snafu with the dessert table - both ends of the table had tea/coffee and the centre had a huge fruit platter so it was assumed there should be two lines going in opposite directions meeting at the fruit platter however the desserts on either side of the fruit weren’t duplicates, it was all unique items so if you wanted an item past the centre of the table you had to kind of interject in the other line. I did this myself and also had it done to me by other non-boomer people. Everybody but the boomer was polite about it though. ",29,1746919773.0,BoomersBeingFools,12,0.92,False

Luxarion stood at its peak, a single cup in hand—half-finished, melting slightly.

“This…” he said somberly, “…is the final slushie.”

He sipped. Slowly. Reverently.

Then crushed the cup in his hand, casting it into the wind where it disintegrated into sparkling sugar dust.

“I shall miss you, fruity friend... But even I must evolve.” With a snap, a steaming **espresso machine** materialized beside him. “Time to trade brain freeze... for brain *fire*.”

Taking a dramatic sip from his tiny gold-trimmed espresso cup, he raised a brow as the **bracket shifted again**.

“Ah, perfect timing! Let’s see what’s brewing next…”

The holographic board zoomed in on the next contenders:  
**Order of Antagonism** vs **Team Beyond**

“Ohohoho, now *this* is juicy. The Order of Antagonism, masters of mischief, versus Team Beyond—who probably brought existential speeches and three-layer capes.”

Luxarion hovered down, espresso in hand, and gave a smug smirk.

“Will Order outwit Beyond? Will Beyond outlast Order? Or will I just need another shot of this *divine* espresso before I find out?”

Another snap—and the two teams were **teleported** to the arena floor, standing ready beneath the shimmering sky.

“Same song, different verse: no killing, no nonsense, and victory comes by knockout or ring-out!”

He raised his new drink to the crowd.

And felt good about it.","I’m an exmo, exconvert (in 2009-2015). After leaving Mormonism I’ve been away from any kind of spirituality until recently, where I started attending a Christian church. 

Today, I volunteered 3 hours of my time at the church cleanup, washing windows. We had coffee and donuts when everyone arrived. Then we had pizza after the scheduled time was over (regardless of if everything was cleaned on the list, we just did our best with the time scheduled). And it was a wonderful time. All cleaning materials were bought with church money. It was expected that you didn’t bring any of your own stuff to keep things fair. 

When I was scrubbing I couldn’t help but think - yeah, I don’t mind helping, because as a member of this church, I have access to my church’s financial statements and can vote on them at our AGMs. Even as a woman (shocking to the Mormon world maybe lol). I know exactly how much each pastor is paid. I know exactly how much we receive in funds from our church members (in general). I’ve been a member of this church for almost a year and I haven’t paid a cent in tithing (I volunteer my labour and throw cash in the bin, but not “tithing” as we know it), because I have expensive hobbies to fund (my horse) and goals (buying a house). Not once have I ever felt less welcome or been unable to fully participate in church activities. No comments have ever been made to me about it because I participate and contribute in ways that are still valued and appreciated just as much. 

It made me feel so sad for the fact that the MFMC *still* asks members for scrub buildings for nothing, while members give so much & have no access to most kinds of useful financial information.

Because she was sick, I suggested we stopped going out everyday, which meant she stopped going to starbucks as often. During her break, it seemed to have gotten better. She stopped coughing as often and the mucus buildup got out of her system.

Long time lurker, first time poster 👋🏽 hello!

I started this hobby in August of last year, being... not in my very best state. The job hunt was brutal, and so was my mental health after a bunch of personal issues. I was very much in not the best shape, but I had been keeping up with stationery YouTube, including TheCoffeeMonsterzCo, and her videos on fountain pens always piqued my curiosity, but I never jumped in...

...that is, until I saw my local stationery shop carrying the TWSBI Eco in Sapphire (set apart from the rest of the pens there), and I knew I had to try it. Coupled with Troublemaker Simoun, I was all set. Or so I thought.

So here I am, multiple bottles, samples, and pens later (you might be able to infer my favourite colour) (I also chose not to include my notebooks because that's... another collection). I got a job in the intervening months (with decent disposable income to indulge every once in a while), and from that rut I gained a hobby that would hopefully be with me for years to come, and a renewed appreciation for the analog (my birthday gift, in fact, is in that LAMY box, the name of which might give away the year I was born 🧐).

(23F) (23F),"My (23F) girlfriend and I (23F) have been together for 1 year. We started long distance (met through mutual friends on Fortnite lol) and fell in love very very fast and strongly. For the past month, we’ve been living together in my parents home because her home conditions were making her feel very stuck and we felt like we were ready. 

However, i’m noticing that we both feel so exhausted from work (she has endometriosis and i have PCOS/ADHD, so fatigue comes on very easily), that when we come home to each other one or both of us is too exhausted to talk much or really do anything special so we just watch tv and doom scroll or play games on our phone. 

i’m recognizing that if we put our full selves towards work during the day, we only seem to have leftover energy, presence, and effort for each other. And that eventually we will feel so disconnected from each other that it’ll feel like we don’t have our spark anymore or one/both of us doesn’t put in any effort anymore. 

So my question is for your examples or suggestions/advice about how to avoid this, and what we can replace phone time with that feels exciting? 

Some things we do now:
- experiment on a meal together
- eat outside 
- go on a walk (have only done once)
- play a video game together
- read with each other outside 
- go get coffee or take out together 
- grocery shop together
- watch a movie with phones down and cuddle 

While we’re good with physical connection, we’ve been lacking in the physical intimacy department since she’s been working and feeling stressed. 

 another important point could be that a lot of our longer, more active and involved conversations tend to be venting about different stressors like work/family/friendships/appearance

I appreciate any advice! It doesn’t feel like our relationship is on a decline but i just want to take preventative measures i suppose because i really love her and would never want this to go south because of our instantaneous dopamine addictions and low energy!

I have her 50% of the time. We are in the US, in the Pacific Northwest.

My relationship with both of my (long divorced) parents has been difficult for a long time. I have no contact with my mother at all. She has never met my daughter. 

Growing up my father waffled between being a fun, caring, understanding guy to being an instantly angry, authoritarian, and emotionally cruel person. I have issues with anger directed towards me to this day, despite years of therapy, because of his anger. It's truly scary. 

Living with him was like walking on eggshells because you never knew which dad you'd get, or what might set him off. For example, I accidentally set fire to the kitchen when home alone once. I got the fire out quickly so damage was minimal, but I expected him to be angry. Instead he joked about just letting the house burn next time and was very reassuring. But then the tiniest things could set him off.

He's now in his late 70s and in poor health. He has Parkinson's with dementia, as well as heart issues. He did not plan for his later years so has zero savings and depends on social security. He leans on me a lot for transportation, medical and insurance coordination, shopping, etc. As the older daughter I'm considered the responsible, capable one. My sister has far fewer expectations of her.

Except, I'm not doing well myself right now. I can't be a good resource for him. Plus I can't talk with him about what I'm facing. He usually gets angry and blames me for whatever it is, even if it's something I have no control over. He has even told my ex-husband things that were meant to stay private, which has caused issues in the past. So I try to keep our conversations superficial. 

My specific problem is twofold. My daughter is (and will remain) the only grandchild. If I don't take her to visit he won't see her. He adores her, but doesn't relate to her very well. As she's grown she wants to see him less and less. She's not stupid; she sees how he treats me. So she never wants to visit him anymore. But he's lonely and wants to see her all the time.

But right now the real problem is that for the last 6 weeks I have had *extremely* limited contact with him because of a horrible incident at our last family dinner (with my father, sister, daughter and me). Things were fine, my daughter was telling a story and (half-jokingly) accused me of something. I got indignant (also half-jokingly) and started to defend myself. I raised my voice, but I was definitely not even close to shouting.

Suddenly my father is *screaming* at me to ""Shut the f#@$ up!"" He repeated that a few times, then started yelling at me, saying I shouldn't get angry with or yell at my daughter. Pot, meet kettle. 

He has criticized my parenting - in front of my child - in the past, and I've talked with him about it. I've studied child development and have a master's in education. I'm open to advice or insight into my parenting, privately, but he goes to extremes. As an example, once she dropped a candy wrapper on the coffee table. I pointed to the nearby trash can and told her that's where her garbage needs to go. NO emotional anything involved, just a normal parent reminder. My dad got upset and told me I was, ""Damaging her self-esteem"" by criticizing her.

This time though the anger was too much for me. I had to go into the bathroom to get away. It was so bad that my sister, who usually loves seeing me get yelled at, came in to comfort me as I was crying. That was very unusual, so even she knew he went too far. 

So since then I haven't spoken with him. A couple of texts, but that's it. Then yesterday he sends me a message telling me that he wants a visit with me and my daughter for Mother's Day. I don't want to go. Time with him is not a celebration, it is torture. I know my daughter won't want to go. Frankly I don't want to see him at all, but my sister says I have to. She suggested dinner on Monday instead. But I'm so traumatized from the last time... I really don't know what to do here. 

So Dad, can I have some advice on how to handle this? I know that the Parkinson's and early dementia can affect emotions and personality, but this wasn't that unusual, it just really got to me.

He needs me to help him, I guess (my sister could step up) but I don't want to see him or talk with him. I'm struggling just to get through each day still breathing as it is.

How do I handle this? How do I meet my obligations to family while protecting myself and my child? ",6,1746918666.0,DadForAMinute,7,0.87,False

1kjmyp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1kjmyp5/it_finally_happened/,It finally happened,"I was having a little self-outing here in northern virginia/dc, got an iced coffee at McDonalds (tried it for the first time today, not bad!), when i noticed two elders outside the store. They made a few attempts to talk with people, then they sat down on a bench — both looked a little down in the dumps. 

For context, I’m 25M who served a mission and graduated from BYU last year, then moved to nova with my wife after both getting jobs. I’ve seen posts on here where other exmo’s decided to say hello and show kindness, so that’s what i did — introduced myself, and asked if they had any dinner plans tonight. They said no, so I offered to get them some McDonalds. They were polite and reluctant at first, but with some pushing, they accepted :) 

I told them I wasn’t a member anymore, and both took it pretty well. They asked if I still believed in Jesus, and I told them it was a little complicated— but I do my best to follow his teachings of loving one another, forgiveness, etc. They liked that— it was true, and ended up being a nice middle ground. I hung out with them while they ate for about ten minutes, then went on my way. 

Their cards don’t load with more money for a few more days, so they’ve been eating a lot of rice and freezer chicken for dinner as of late (also— do members not organize dinners for missionaries anymore? I went hungry in my mission too bc of occasional cancellations, but from the way they were talking, it sounded like they’ve been eating chicken and rice for dinner every day this week).

Dear LDS Church (since I know y’all keep tabs on this reddit page): Your missionaries are HUNGRY. HUNGRY!!! They pay THOUSANDS of dollars of their own money to be a 24/7 slave to you, an organization that has HUNDREDS of BILLIONS. At the bare minimum, they deserve enough food money to afford 3 hardy meals a day. If a member feeds them, they can spend the extra money on snacks and treats. Give them more fucking money for christ’s sake!!!!! 

Overall though, a nice experience. Thank you to those who have previously posted for giving me the courage to show some kindness!

1kjmx7w,https://i.redd.it/vlivd1z1b10f1.jpeg,"Does anybody else live in one of Boulder's ""walkability deserts"", and what--if anything--can or should be done to improve these areas?","This is a heat map of [Boulder's WalkScore](https://www.walkscore.com/CO/Boulder).  Green areas are most walkable, yellow areas are somewhat walkable, and pale red/pink or uncolored areas are not very walkable.  WalkScore, if you don't know, basically uses a ""how much useful stuff is within walking distance"" algorithm to come up with these scores.

This isn't without its flaws or subjective elements, but I think the basic gist is a decent way to look at things.  Most people aren't willing to walk long distances to, say, grab a bite to eat or pick up a gallon of milk.  They'll drive, or possibly bike or take transit instead.

I've circled four areas above where the population density is fairly high--at least slightly higher than the average American suburb, anyway--but the walkability is fairly poor.  We moved to one of these areas from the downtown area (Whittier) less than a year ago due to the arrival of our second child and the need for more space, and it's been a bit of a comedown, though I do still enjoy the bike infrastructure.

Where I live, it's almost a mile to the closest shopping center.  I think I'm kind of an outlier--I'll sometimes walk that distance to buy groceries or the like--but the number of trips I've made on foot has sharply declined and the number of driving trips I make has definitely increased.  The distances are just too far.  And I really miss just being able to walk a couple of blocks to a coffee shop or restaurant.

So I guess I have two questions for others who live in these areas and I guess everyone else in Boulder:

1) Do you see the lack of walkability in certain neighborhoods as a negative, or do you like it better that way?

2) If you *would* like your neighborhood/other neighborhoods to be more walkable, what do you think are the best ways the city could go about addressing this?",23,1746918499.0,boulder,33,0.83,False

[  ] Drip coffee with 1 Tbsp of 2% milk **(~1g)**

[  ] Bobs Red Mill protein oats **(1g)** made with egg whites, 1 Tbsp flaxseed meal **(1g)**, one chopped pear, and 2 Tbsp almond butter **(3g)**

[  ] 99% lean turkey chili **(~1g)** made with with three types of beans, zucchini, and bell pepper, topped with 1/4 of a large avocado **(~1g)**; blueberries 

[  ] One slice of sourdough drizzled with EVOO **(~1g)**, applesauce with 1 Tbsp flaxseed meal **(~1g)**, small handful of raw walnuts and almonds **(~1g)**

[  ] Lemon basil baked chicken breast **(~1g)** with roasted artichoke hearts and barley

[  ] Three prunes 

I don't use a tracker, but I do read all nutrition labels and look up sat fat content online for whole foods (which can admittedly vary widely by source). This feels like a pretty strict day for me, and I still ate around 12 g of saturated fat, not even counting the small amount of avocado oil I used to make the chili and roasted artichokes. I try to keep it all from healthy sources but I would love to build in some wiggle room to have a piece of dark chocolate sometimes. I was surprised to learn that my rolled oats contain 1g. 

Are my estimates (indicated by ""~"") too high or too low? Does the exact number of grams not matter as long as they're all from heart healthy foods? I can trim 1g by swapping 2% milk in my coffee for fat free, and cut out meat, but I'm otherwise stumped at how to keep my intake of nuts/seeds/avocado up without going over 10%.
