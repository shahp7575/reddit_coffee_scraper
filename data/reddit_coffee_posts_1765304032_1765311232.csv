Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message and introduce yourself !

1pihuhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstagramMarketing/comments/1pihuhs/experimenting_with_affordable_ig_growth_options/,"Experimenting With Affordable IG Growth Options, Am I Overthinking This?","Hey everyone!

I’ve been slowly trying to grow my Instagram page, and the deeper I get, the more confusing everything feels. Half the internet swears you can grow organically only, and the other half claims there are shortcuts that magically solve everything. Meanwhile, I’m just here trying to figure out what actually makes sense on a normal person’s budget.

Every time I see those free followers claims, it always ends the same way. Sketchy surveys, apps asking for my login, or something that screams bot farm. Definitely not worth the headache.

So I started looking at actual paid options. Ads are cool in theory, but even a tiny campaign gets pricey fast, and the dashboard feels like it was built for people with full-time marketing roles. Not exactly beginner-friendly.

Then I noticed some growth tools offering really small packages, not the scammy instant fame stuff, just little boosts that cost less than a cup of coffee. It made me rethink the whole picture. Maybe low-cost paid growth isn’t completely ridiculous if it’s used carefully and paired with real content and engagement.

Now I’m wondering how people here approach it.  
Do you stick strictly to organic, do ads, or do you mix in small, budget-friendly boosts here and there?

Consider the [average day of a CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emYzsU7WeKo):

1. Wake up
2. Go to the gym
3. Go to the office
4. Get briefed by your assistant
5. Respond to some emails
6. Go to some meetings
7. Lunch
8. Sit through a strategic initiatives meeting
9. Send some emails
10. Go home

And now consider the [average day of a professor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZgX7g-qLoE):

1. Wake up
2. Drink coffee
3. Give the same lecture you've done 1000 times with nobody listening
4. Go to a research meeting
5. Lunch with other faculty you don't really like
6. Talk with graduate students about research
7. Write a grant you probably won't get
8. Go home

Everybody who isn't a CEO or professor looks at these schedules and thinks to themselves, ""These people aren't doing *anything*"", followed by ""I can do *that*."" On most days, this is probably correct. The trajectory of Chipotle would not change if I was CEO for a day. College students around the world would still get their protein slop bowls that day, and life would go on.

Some people consider this oppression: ""Why do CEOs get paid more than I do, when they're writing leisurely emails and I'm digging ditches in the hot sun?"" Although this might happen in a few cases like nepotism, in a competitive labor market one should not expect CEOs to get paid out of proportion to the value they add. In [No One is Really Working](https://www.humaninvariant.com/blog/working), I offer seven explanations as to why professionals get paid high salaries to do seemingly nothing. One rationale goes as follows:

At first glance, this feels intuitively true. Adam has a skill that not many people have (programming), Brenda has a skill that more people have (copywriting), and Carl has a skill that everyone has (talking). Adam and Brenda have work outputs that clearly translate to the bottom line of the company while Carl does not.

Contrary to popular belief, Carl actually deserves the highest compensation. This is because his work has the highest potential impact on increasing the company's bottom line.

In this post, I describe derivative levels as a model for understanding a worker's leverage in changing a company's output.

Alongside that, I’m planning a business incubator. For a reasonable monthly fee, members would get:

* Help forming an LLC (with me as registered agent)
* A business mailing address with suite number
* Use of conference rooms
* A flexible mix of storage, office, and consignment space
* Up to 20 hours of my time each month for help with setup, planning, or support
* 24/7 access, including shared desks or private office space options

I also want to include a “third space” hangout area—welcoming, creative lounge spaces where people can meet, hold events, or just chill for $25/mo.

1pihp4g,https://i.redd.it/u2v18dw1j86g1.png,I had until midnight to kill Rodney Dirkowitz,"I had until midnight, she had said. 

Now it was 3:27 in the afternoon, and I was sitting in my apartment on Western Avenue, staring at a cheap black-and-white photo of a man named Rodney Dirkowitz. I turned the photograph over in my fingers. It was the sort of cheap gloss they send to extras, an instant from a brief smile with a cropped wall of cheap stucco behind him. I could feel my organs writhing and bulging within my stomach like a blender changing modes. I had until midnight to kill Rodney Dirkowitz.

Outside the window my face smiled from a billboard, larger than life and insolent as a god. I had filmed that grin into permanence, the same fake smile from *Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye*. The movie posters had been plastered everywhere that week; “Martin Vale in *The Saint of Sunset Boulevard!*” My expression couldn’t be more different now. Photos are a kindness; they let people love an idea and not the clay that houses it.

I glanced back down at the grainy photograph in my hand. Rodney had a face that belonged in the background of a film, one of those extras that walked behind the star to make the world feel real. Maybe that’s why it was so hard to look at him. I’d made a living off faces like his.

The photograph began to shake violently in my hands. I willed myself to calm down, but I realized that my skin was moving. The top of my hand rippled like a pool of water as something pressed from underneath. My veins stood up against the skin, blue and tight as they writhed like snakes. My stomach clenched and contorted hard enough to make me gag. I could feel the buildup of gas bubbles churning within me as I stumbled from my chair and threw open the bathroom door. I leaned over the sink as a viscous mass erupted from my throat, followed by a steady stream of blood. I caught my breath for a moment, gazing down at the crimson deluge that filled my formerly pristine sink. It was a quivering, pulsating mass of pus and bloody gelatin, littered with a few chunks of ruptured flesh, like flattened meatballs within a murky jell-o. 

Blinking away the pain, I looked up at my reflection in the bathroom mirror. The light overhead buzzed and blinked as I ran a hand down my face, trying to collect my thoughts. I froze, my hand halfway down my face. My skin felt soft and sticky, like clay left out in the sun. I carefully lifted my hand from my face, stringy bits of flesh falling away like cheese from a fresh slice of pizza. Two red handprints were etched onto my skin, the lower levels of skin exposed to the harsh light. I carefully walked out of the bathroom, grabbing my coat from the sofa and opened the door to my apartment. 

Outside, Los Angeles looked like it always did, too bright and cheery for the things that happened in it. Taxis trundled their way down the crowded streets, passing men in gray suits walking quickly along the sidewalks, clutching their briefcases close. A kid licked a popsicle while a woman in a red dress stepped out of a florist’s with a handful of lilies. I glanced back up at the billboard, my chest twisting in pain. I looked back down to see a phone booth beside the drugstore. The door creaked shut behind me as the smell of old cigarettes and glass cleaner filled my nose. My reflection stared back at me in the dirty glass, blurred around the edges. I pulled the folded phone book from the rack and flipped through the D’s until I found him. Dirkowitz, Rodney. 3811 Union Avenue. Westlake.

I wrote it down on a spare diner napkin with some effort, the pen pressing into my soft flesh like a stylus in clay. When I pushed open the booth door, a man was standing on the sidewalk staring at me. He squinted and tilted his head.

“Hey… say, aren’t you—”

I forced a smile. “Nope.”

He frowned, trying to place me.

“I get that a lot,” I said. “People think I’m that actor. What’s-his-name.”

“Martin Vale?”

“That’s the one,” I said, flashing him a smile as I moved past him. “You have a good night, pal.”

I turned the corner fast, my heart hammering in my chest like a war drum. I couldn’t let anyone see me. If the studio got wind I was walking around like this, I’d be finished.

The smile had set off another cascade. My left eyelid thickened and sagged like a waterlogged curtain. The corner of my mouth quivered as if snakes had nested under the skin. 

I ducked into a store across the street, scanning the aisles until I found what I needed; a long tan trench coat, a fedora, and a pair of dark sunglasses. I threw a couple bills on the counter and staggered towards the door. Thankfully, the clerk didn’t even look up from his magazine.

As the door swung shut behind me, the ache in my gut spread to my ribs. My stomach bulged and shifted as if it was filled with a wet load of cement struggling to set. I leaned against the storefront and steadied myself until my head stopped spinning, then I buttoned the coat up past my neck, shoved the sunglasses on, and kept walking.

The trench coat hid the first small depressions that formed along my forearms, little indentations that made my veins stand out like cords. It masked the soft give under my ribcage where the tissue seemed to be unspooling from the bone. Under the hat, the band of hair along my temple pulled away from my skull with sloppy wet sound. I kept touching it instinctively, and each time my fingers came away with a smear, a fine dusting that collected on the napkin where Rodney’s address lay.

Rodney’s place was a squat little building with a cracked sign that read *Magnolia Terrace Apartments*. I stood in the phone book on the corner of the block, across the street from the apartment steps, just close enough that I could see the numbers on the mailboxes. I picked up the phone, keeping the receiver off the hook to make it look like I had a reason to stand there. Strands of flesh stuck to the plastic surface, strewn across it like melted cheese.

Ten minutes later, Rodney stepped out of the front door, wearing a plain white shirt and slacks, his hair neatly combed back. He stopped halfway down the steps to light a cigarette, then walked down the block toward the streetcar stop.

I watched him buy a paper from a dirt-stained kid. He leaned against a side-post and flipped him an extra quarter, a shadow of a half-smile flitting across his face as the kid beamed up at him gratefully. Rodney boarded the streetcar and laughed with the driver, who slapped him on the back, a smile spreading across his tired face. 

In the reflection of the glass, I saw myself. My jaw had sagged, the bone slightly detached from the drooping flesh. The flesh under my chin hung like melted candlewax.

Rodney got off three stops later on a cleaner street lined with diners and mom-and-pop stores. He stopped just before a corner deli and took a deep breath, adjusting his hair and popping a breath mint. He turned the corner and smiled when he spotted someone inside. A woman in a blue dress was wiping down the counter. He waved at her and she beamed back at him.

Through the glass, I watched them talk for a few minutes. I couldn’t hear a thing, but I could see enough. She laughed at something he said. I got the impression he was asking her out to dinner.

My stomach twisted again, hunching me forward as I pressed my hand to it. I felt skin along my ribs bubbled beneath my hand like frothing milk. When I pulled my hand away, it came back slick with a viscous slime. I leaned against the glass wall of the phone booth and tried to breathe.

She had said midnight.

I checked my watch. 6:43.

Five hours left.

I needed a plan. I couldn’t just shoot him on the street, not unless I wanted to film my next role from a prison cell. I had to find a place where I could make it look like an accident… maybe his apartment. I could follow him home and wait for the right moment.

I stayed in the booth, watching them through the glass as they talked. She poured him coffee while he grinned at her like she was the last source of light in the world.

When the sun dipped, the light thinned, and a cold came in with it, a pre-midnight that stung my exposed skin. When he reached across the counter to touch her hand, something in my chest snapped.

I wasn’t jealous or angry, I was scared. Because while he smiled, I felt my own lips beginning to tear. I lifted a trembling hand and touched my face. The side of my face had completely split open. When I pulled my fingers away, they ran with blood.

They stayed in the diner until her shift ended and taking her hand in his, he led her out the door. The second he started off down Church Street, I knew where he was going. I’d dined a fair share of women there myself, at the Club Ambassador. Surprise washed over me as they turned into a small corner deli with scuffed linoleum and sat at a booth. I stood in a phone booth three blocks away and watched.

I felt the transformation tear away at me like a heavy rain, rivulets of liquid running down my body as my skin stiffened and tore like a thin sheets of paper.

I pressed a handkerchief against the corner of my mouth and the blood soaked through it almost instantly. My jaw throbbed in time with my heartbeat and I realized with a sinking feeling that I couldn’t feel my nose anymore.

Across the street, Rodney was paying the bill. She ran a hand along his arm as he scribbled his signature.

When they stepped out onto the sidewalk, I kept behind the glow of a streetlamp. My coat collar was pulled up to my ears and my hat tiled low in an attempt to hide my ruination.

Rodney was talking about something animatedly, waving his hands and laughing. The girl, Mary, I’d heard him call her that—walked close beside him. She had a yellow scarf tied in her hair, and she gazed up at him as if she was looking upon the face of God.

They didn’t have any right to look so happy.

I stayed far enough back to not raise suspicion. The air had filled with frigidity and the breeze off the boulevard carried the smell of frying oil, perfume, and car exhaust as my stomach made a noise like wet paper tearing.

I followed behind them as they crossed the street, staying a few cars behind. I clutched my side as the pain in my stomach had grown sharper. My coat felt tight around my shoulders, like the fabric was shrinking. Every few blocks, I reached under the lapel to feel my chest. Each time, it was softer and more pliable, like a wet dough.

At the next light, a couple walked past me and the woman frowned. She was staring at my jaw. I looked down quickly, but not before she gasped and clutched her boyfriend’s arm.

I turned down the next alley, my heart racing. The pain behind my eyes was blinding now, the world shimmering around the edges as my head swam. I could smell myself, a sweet rotten scent like meat left out in the sun.

There was a gas station at the end of the street, a faded open sign buzzing in the window. The man inside was reading a magazine and didn’t look up as I walked in the door. I grabbed a roll of bandages and a bottle of aspirin from the nearest shelf, my hand slick against the plastic surface.

“Bathroom?” I rasped.

He pointed to the far wall without looking.

Inside, the mirror over the sink was cracked, and the tile floor was yellowed with age. I locked the door behind me and turned to the mirror.

My skin had completely sagged from my face, peeling away in loose folds of fat. Streaks of the blood-red flesh that lay beneath the surface had been laid bare and I gingerly touched the exposed bone where my nose used to be. As I stared into the mirror, the last few strands of skin still attached tore away and my face fell to the floor. I stooped down and picked up the fleshy mass, examining it with a perverse curiosity as I distorted the skin into that million dollar smile.

I flung the flesh into the bathroom trash can and downed the bottle of aspirin before reaching for the roll of bandages and unbuttoning the coat from my neck. I wound the bandages around my malformed torso and head, the squelching sound of settling organs sending another wave of nausea washing over me. It was like binding undercooked meatloaf, my blood already soaking through the white cloth. I’d have puked, if it hadn’t meant my intestines would erupt from my throat. I pulled the hat back on, tucked the sunglasses into the weave of bandages and buttoned my coat to the neck. 

The man behind the counter didn’t say a word when I set down a few bills for the bandages and the aspirin.

Stepping outside, the cold air burned as it entered my lungs. I could hear it sizzling like acid within my chest.

Rodney and Mary were sitting on a bench outside an ice cream parlor, sharing a vanilla ice cream cone. The streetlight above them lit everything in a dreamy haze.

I stood behind a row of newspaper boxes across the street and watched them closely.

He was talking about something funny and she doubled over laughing, the ice cream nearly falling from her cone. He caught it with his hand and laughed with her. He had that same open, easy grin that had always felt fake for me, stretching my skin for years and years.

They walked slowly down the sidewalk as I followed closely behind, my shoes squelching faintly with each step, like walking through mud. I stayed on the opposite side of the street, trying to match their pace. My legs didn’t move correctly anymore, the joints too loose in some places and too tight in others, forcing me into an awkward shuffling gait.

They reached her apartment building, a standard brick building with a little white fence, and flowers growing through the cracks. Mary stopped at the gate and turned towards him.

“I had a lovely time,” she said. I could read her lips even from across the street.

He said something back, smiling nervously. She leaned in and kissed him quick on the cheek, then turned away and skittishly traipsed inside. Rodney stood there for a second like he couldn’t believe it had happened. He looked up at the sky and pumped his fist like a kid who’d won a prize at the fair. 

I felt the skin on my neck peel away from my collar. I reached up to pull it back and felt a warm slickness between my fingers. When I looked down, the front of my trench coat was wet with blood. I stumbled, my shoes clapping loudly against the pavement. Rodney’s head turned suddenly, searching in my direction. I ducked below a low hedge, my heart pounding and my hands trembling as a thick liquid began to steadily stream from beneath my coat.

Mary’s voice called from her window, drawing his attention. She said something about forgetting his hat. He laughed and waved to her as she tossed it down to him. He caught in with an exaggerated gesture and blew her a kiss goodnight.

He turned and walked down the street, whistling under his breath and spinning his hat around in his hands. 

I waited a full minute before standing up again, the night quiet except for the hum of the streetlights. I could tell that bandages around my head were damp now. The fabric clung to me, dark and sticky beneath the brim of my hat.

I stepped out from behind the hedge, still quivering uncontrollably, and followed him at a distance. The trench coat hung strangely off my distorted form and I felt pieces of myself shifting inside it with every step.

He crossed the street and reached for the door to his apartment building. My time was now. I stumbled across the street, moving haphazardly towards him. He walked into the lobby, the door swinging shut behind him. I pulled it open with some effort, stepping into the lobby, overwhelmed by the smell of cigarettes and old rainwater. 

Rodney’s name was on a brass plate next to door 2B. I pressed my ear against the wood and I heard running water. He was in the shower. I reached for the door handle and it turned smoothly beneath my hand. I stepped over the threshold and into his small one-room apartment with a bed, a tiny table, and lit only by a single lamp.

I glanced up at the clock on the wall.

11:51.

Steam curled out from the doorway of the bathroom. I could see his shadow moving behind the shower curtain. I reached into the pocket of my trench coat and tried to grab my revolver, but I couldn’t feel the handle.

I stared down at my arm in horror. The flesh had completely melted away, leaving only a few strands of tendons and the exposed bone. I turned back to the doorway and saw the remains of my hand still wrapped around the door handle. 

A raw sound erupted from my throat, somewhere between a growl and a sob. I braced myself against the wall, leaving a dark smear. 

I staggered toward the bathroom, my flesh pulsing beneath the bandages. The pain was like a burning fire now, searing through every exposed nerve. The heat hit me as I stumbled into the room, sizzling against me. The bright lights burned my dry eyes and I hissed, the protective layers of my eyelids long since melted away.

Something inside me gave way as my chest swelled, then sank, then swelled again, contracting like a mother giving birth. I could hear the bones grinding within me as my hat fell from my undulating head. The sunglasses clattered to the tile as the bandages loosened and fell to the floor like snakeskin.

Rodney pulled the curtain aside and his face went white. I don’t know what he saw. I couldn’t see clearly anymore. My eyes spun askew within my bulbous flesh as everything ran together. He screamed and tripped backward into the tub, the water splashing against the wall. I lunged at him and he fought me, wrapping his hands around my skeletal frame, but I was barely more than a pile of wet meat pressing him down. I pooled around him, holding him in place as I reached with what was left of my arm and drove it down into his chest.

I pushed down with all of my might, once, twice, three times. I heard the sound of cracking bone as I bludgeoned away repeatedly and I wasn’t sure if it was his bones or mine. The water turned red in the tub, mixing with his pooling blood and the pieces of me that the boiling water stripped away, chunks of cooking flesh swirling in the viscous crimson tide.

His screaming stopped and I felt his body go still under mine. The light above the mirror flickered as I struggled to my feet, my bones screaming at me in pain. I stared down at the corpse and the holes that lined its chest, wide and dark. For a moment, I couldn’t move as my flesh dripped onto the tiles.

I felt a warmth blossom in my stomach as the pain began to fade and the noise in my head went silent. I stumbled backwards, my body feeling impossibly light. My arm trembled when I lifted it. My hand was whole again, the skin clean and smooth. I gingerly touched my face, the flesh firm and my jaw solid.

I let out a peal of relieved laughter, joyously running my hands across my whole body, feeling every inch of my form, thankful for every stretch of skin.

I heard the clock in the other room strike twelve, the chime echoing through the apartment. I leaned on the sink, breathing hard. I wanted to cry. I wanted to sleep. I looked at my hands again, just to be sure. They were as smooth as ever, healthier, even.

I turned my head, wiping the sweat from my forehead as I looked into the mirror.

A pulsating, wet mound of flesh stared back at me, half-sunken eyes spinning across its surface, writhing and distorting with every haggard breath. My hands flew to my face and the mound mirrored my movements, stretching its skin as its mouth spread wider.

I recognized the smile in the mirror.",2,1765310731.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1pihod6,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1pihod6/has_anyone_been_diagnosed_with_lpr_following_a/,Has anyone been diagnosed with LPR following a viral infection?,"I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read the longer version - but the question is pretty simple. Have any of you developed LPR after a viral infection destroyed or weakened your tissue?

TLDR -- 

Got sick. Started with globus feeling, then eventual basic cold symptoms for a week. Mild. 

Post nasal drip feel stuck around for months. Globus was rare but not wholly uncommon. Once a week maybe, if that. 

I'd have strands of good days and bad days with no real reasoning. Diet was pretty consistent and full of acidic and high fat foods here and there. I never developed a pattern of 'aha, it's always after x or y'all

No other symptoms at all but for mucus in throat (globus feel / some nasal drip)

Possibly sensitive to strong perfumes and fragrances?)

I don't burp, get heartburn, or anything else related to gerd. 

I will try to see an ENT soon. AI is convinced it's LPR from a viral infection - am now on day 5 of a bland diet, some 4-5 months from the time it started shortly after recovering from sickness. 


I want to start by saying I have not seen an ENT to confirm what I have yet, though I believe it to be LPR. I understand I absolutely need to do and I hope to soon, but money is very tight at this time. 

 I believe it started following a catching a viral infection sometime in late July/Early August of this year. I went out with some friends one night, a couple days later felt that 'globus sensation' firstly.. followed by a very slight cough and then eventually some congestion and a runny nose. I didn't test for anything as it was all mild and basic cold symptoms. But I never usually suffer from sore throats or coughs, I don't think I have since I was young, so it was odd I felt the globus feeling, but I brushed it off as a start of a sickness thing, and technically I was right. That mild cold lasted a week or so and then I was good to go. It's worth mentioning I had taken up a hobby of fragrances (cologne) for a few months prior and I've been told that could have primed my throat tissue to become sensitive to such a force like a viral infection. 

After I had recovered from the cold, I noticed this odd feeling of that globus sensation sticking around sometimes at random times, and often a feeling I remember describing as a feeling similar to post nasal drip which I'd never felt before myself but made sense after hearing what it feels like. I originally felt like I just had excess mucus lingering from the sickness and continued waiting it out for my body to heal it and move on. 

A month later, I had a weird two week spell of some sort of GI issue. A feeling of a dull pressure in my stomach area (mostly my bottom left stomach area, but it would be in different spots sometimes). This freaked me out thinking I had some constipation issue or something. I took miralax, senna tea, etc all to no real resolve. I incorporated some probiotics to my diet and tried limiting my diet but not sure what helped out in the end. One day, I just returned to eating some junk food and had the best BM I'd had in weeks and that was that. Maybe it was a covid GI issue, if I ever had covid, or maybe it was something I ate / was taking. I don't know. Maybe not even relevant whatsoever to LPR at all. 

The globus sensation was a sort of rare thing for me going forward, but often I'd still have that mucus feeling stuck in my throat. I couldn't stop myself from bringing up mucus into my mouth in a reverse swallowing method and spitting it out. Nothing painful, just annoying and overstaying its welcome. I reached a point where I felt like I went days not really thinking about it or noticing it to sometimes having a bad day or two in a row. Eventually I started taking saline sprays / rinses and I believed they were helping to some degree but in retrospect they really weren't. I was never congested or anything, just trying to calm down the mucus production. 

Around October, now 3 months later, I discovered nasonex and firmly believe that was helpful since starting it despite not being a miracle. I was convinced what I had going on, after chatting with a doctor online in a brief consultation, was a sensitive tissue lining following a viral infection. That, by staying hydrated and resting it will repair on its own eventually and to stay away from fragrances and highly acidic things that would irritate it. In her words I was still 'in the normal range' for anyone still struggling from this and it wouldn't be much longer, especially if I followed the protocol amazingly well. 

I'd brushed off the idea of it being LPR whatsoever because I don't have any of the classic signs of anything related to hers or anything else. I otherwise feel 100% ok! Just this annoying nasal drip feeling and a rare globus sensation now and again. And during this entire time period my diet had never changed much. I stopped caffeine and switched to decaf coffee in the AM (i know) and I otherwise don't really think my diet changed much (not a great diet but not awful either). 

On thanksgiving, after spending the day with family for the majority of the lunch into the night, I felt absolutely great. When I got home, I realized I was feeling the globus sensation worse than I had in a long time, if ever. Immediately I went into a mini panic and took everything I could to try and think of a way to prevent this from getting any worse - allergy meds, the acid reducer chews, nasonex, a saline rinse, etc. I made a food journal of the day as I had a lot of foods and surely one of them must be the one I'm allergic to or something. I did have lemonade, a few zero sugar sodas, some dried food and was exposed to hair spray and cologne for the day. 

Please don't laugh, but I eventually turned to AI for a bit for help. I find AI comforting when I'm left with questions and struggling to find direction to turn towards feeling optimistic again. I've not been chatting with Google for over two weeks. Google AI is convinced I had a post viral infection issue that did permeant damage to my larynx tissue and has now given me LPR symptoms and threw me on a diet now if very bland foods. I'm on day 5 today of water, chamomile tea, plain oatmeal, toast, rice, bananasz broccoli and tofu. I don't know if I feel amazing yet but if I'm repairing 4 months of bad diet after getting LPR, it probably needs a lot more time to heal and for the globus irritation to wind down and get off high-alert mode. Google swears in a few days, especially weeks, the diet will limit the high-stressed larynx tissue and allow it to heal which will reduce the globus indefinitely and allow less of the nasal drip feeling. 

So far... I've never burped often, I don't have a cough, no heartburn, no weird taste in my mouth. The only LPR symptom I have, apparently anyways, is certain foods being a trigger but I haven't noticed a convincing pattern as I've had many good days in a row while on a bad diet (I literally ate an entire pizza and a bottle of soda no more than two weeks ago and felt nothing after). But there's been times it's hit me some hours following eating some chocolate. I'm also pretty sure my cheap candle in the past flared me up too, so I think fragrances also irritated that sensitive area. 

I will see an ENT soon when I can comfortably spend that money. For now, I appreciate anyone reading this and with any input. It's so odd to just one day hear you may have gotten sick and the damage it did was enough to give you a lifetime illness that will forever change your diet and lifestyle. Learning I may have to give up alcohol,.coffee and chocolate forever is devastating to me. I was under the impression once my tissue healed, I'd get back to feeling how I was earlier with no issues with anything whatsoever, but digging deeper into this.. even after this bland diet test ends, I may never be able to reintroduce certain things again or fear continuing this whole cycle again. 

I know everyone's different with this but any comments or questions is appreciated. But following this sub for a while I realize I have had a much more minor version of it, while eating a ton of the bad stuff for it, not using medication whatsoever, and still been able to have many normal days. It still leaves me believing I don't have an acid issue whatsoever but it's the only thing left that makes any logical sense. 

Thanks everyone. ",1,1765310685.0,LPR,1,1.0,False

I love Asuka and Kuma, but man I hate what they have done to them in terms of story/character episode wise. Kuma lost in his character episode and once again Asuka is treated as Lili's sidekick. As for Hwoarang, I thought it wasnt interesting at all.

Those were the strict rules Rosalie's husband, Benjamin, had set for her, all because of his severe germophobia.

One day, she accidentally drank from his cup. He threw it away in disgust, as if it had been poisoned. During her period, she accidentally stained the passenger seat of his car. He held his breath, pulled over, and called his assistant to sell the car immediately. After that, she was never allowed to sit in any of his cars again.

Rosalie said nothing. She became even more careful, respecting his obsessive habits. Before sleeping beside him, she showered three times. To hold his hand, she wiped her palms with disinfectant until they were raw. She thought that if she followed his rules long enough, he would eventually let her into his world.

That was, until both she and his widowed sister-in-law, Cassandra, fell into the river. It was then Rosalie realized the one he loved was Cassandra.

If Benjamin didn't treasure her, then she didn't want him anymore. She would marry his lifelong rival—the man who had proposed to her 9,999 times, Oliver Vargas.

After visiting the cemetery, the car carrying her and Cassandra was hit halfway home. Everything spun. Both of them fell into the muddy river beside the road.

""Help..."" Rosalie couldn't swim. Out of instinct, she opened her mouth to shout, but only swallowed more dirty river water. Through the blur, she saw Benjamin jump in without hesitation.

Her survival instincts kicked in. She reached her hand toward him. ""Ben... help me...""

But then, Cassandra's voice rang out at the same time. ""Benny... help me...""

Benjamin hesitated only for a second before swimming straight past Rosalie toward Cassandra. ""Rosa, Cassie can't swim. I'll save her first. Hold on!""

Rosalie's pupils contracted. Her heart felt as if it had been pierced by ice. She tried to grab his sleeve, but before her fingers even touched the fabric, he swung his arm hard and shoved her away.

As the suffocating pain grew stronger, her arms and legs started to lose strength. All she could do was watch the light on the water's surface blur and fade away...

She and Benjamin first met during a bank robbery. He was wearing a black designer suit, looking calm and noble among the terrified crowd. When the police arrived, the robber panicked and grabbed him as a hostage. Benjamin didn't even flinch. With just one sharp look, he cooperated with the police to shoot the robber dead.

When the gun went off, everyone else trembled in fear. Only he stayed calm, his eyes glancing down coldly at the robber's curled-up body. His strong brows didn't even twitch. Rosalie couldn't take her eyes off him, her heart trembling.

She begged her father to introduce them. Her father saw right through her and immediately disagreed. ""You can like anyone you want, just not Benjamin. He's got severe germophobia. Dozens of women have tried, but none ever got close.""

""So what? I'm beautiful, I've got a good figure, and I'm nice. I can win his heart.""

Back then, she was full of confidence, bright and radiant, chasing after him everywhere. When she learned he liked bread pudding from the South Side of Chicago, she drove across half the city just to bring him a warm serving. When he got sick overseas on a business trip, she chartered a private plane, flew to his hotel, and took care of him for three days straight.

The most dangerous time was when he went to a mountain site and got caught in a landslide. Ignoring everyone's warnings, she dug him out of the mud with her bare hands. After that, he proposed to her.

""I need someone to marry for the family's benefit.""

No ring. Not a single word about love. She was overjoyed, holding his arm, asking if he had finally fallen for her. Benjamin quietly brushed her hand off and gave a faint ""yeah.""

Blinded by happiness, Rosalie didn't notice the flash of disgust in his eyes. But when she thought back, the day he proposed to her... was the same day Cassandra married Benjamin's eldest brother, Joseph Malone!

So Benjamin never loved her! Rosalie's love was just his way of patching up a broken heart!

Before Rosalie lost consciousness, a bodyguard pulled her out of the river. But even after she reached the shore, Benjamin didn't look at her once. He held Cassandra tightly, whispering to her.

""It's okay. You're safe now. I've got you.""

He had always hated dirt, but now his expensive suit was soaked with foul, muddy water. Grime clung to his hair, yet he didn't seem to care. All he cared about was the woman in his arms. There was a tenderness in his eyes that he had never given Rosalie.

Shivering, Rosalie wrapped her arms around herself as hot tears streamed down. She had truly believed he had severe germophobia. A year of dating, three years of marriage, over 1,200 days and nights, she followed every rule he made. But now Rosalie knew... that wasn't it. Those rules were only for her. For Cassandra, there were none.

How ironic! How ridiculous!

Cassandra noticed the look on Rosalie's face, and pride flashed in her eyes. She suddenly clutched her chest. ""My necklace! Benny, the necklace you gave me is gone!""

Benjamin immediately said, ""It must've fallen in the river. Don't worry. I'll find it."" Without hesitation, he jumped back into the filthy water. After diving several times, he finally found Cassandra's necklace and handed it to her like a prize. ""Don't cry anymore. I found it.""

Rosalie let out a bitter laugh. Her hands trembled as she wiped her tears and pulled out her phone. For the first time, she replied to that same message she had been getting for years—""For the 9,999th time. Rosie, when are you divorcing Benjamin and marrying me?""

Through blurry vision, she typed each word carefully. ""Return from abroad and find me after thirty days.""

If Benjamin didn't treasure her, then she didn't want him anymore. She would marry her lifelong rival. The man who had proposed to her 9,999 times, Oliver Vargas.

Chapter 2
Rosalie and Cassandra were both sent to the hospital. The moment Benjamin stepped into the hospital hallway, the air around him seemed to grow colder. A faint trace of disgust and discomfort flashed through his pale blue eyes. But after glancing at Cassandra, he forced himself to hold it in and stayed by her side the whole time, never taking a single step away.

Rosalie's gaze fell on them, and it felt as if someone had carved a hole through her heart. The emptiness hurt so much she could barely breathe.

During their three years of marriage, Benjamin hadn't always been cold to her. When he came home from parties, he would sometimes bring her a cup of her favorite gelato. When she felt down, he would pat her head gently through his gloves.

But when she once got a high fever and begged him to come visit her at the hospital, he said, ""Rosalie, stop forcing me. You know hospitals are full of germs, and I have serious germophobia.""

Yet now, in front of Cassandra, his germophobia seemed miraculously cured. He actually stepped into the hospital—the very place he had always feared like the plague.

She had once heard someone say that love meant unconditional tolerance and compromise. Just like how she did for Benjamin, and how Benjamin did for Cassandra.

After leaving the hospital, Rosalie took the divorce papers that her lawyer had drafted and went to see Benjamin.

""I want a divorce. Sign it.""

Benjamin pursed his thin lips tightly. ""Just because I didn't save you first? Rosalie, Cassie can't swim. Of course I had to save her first!""

Rosalie couldn't help but laugh, though her eyes burned with tears. ""She can't swim! Do you think I can?""

Benjamin froze for two seconds. Then impatience flashed between his brows. ""Even if you can't, even if I didn't save you, you're still fine, aren't you?""

His self-righteous tone hit her like fire, burning through every bit of her heart. All her struggle, longing, and unwillingness to let go turned to ashes in that fire. Only bone-deep emptiness was left. She didn't want to argue anymore. Too tired to care, she closed her eyes and pointed to the signature line.

""Sign it.""

Benjamin didn't move. His cold eyes were sharp as ice. ""Can you stop being unreasonable?""

With a click, the door opened from the outside. Cassandra walked in. When she saw the divorce papers spread on the table, the corners of her mouth lifted ever so slightly. She first handed a cup of hot tea to Benjamin and said softly, ""Rosalie, Ben didn't mean it. Here. Have some hot tea. It's my way of apologizing for him.""

Her expression was gentle, but pride flickered in her eyes. A sharp pain struck Rosalie's heart. Without thinking, she swung her hand.

""Get out of my way.""

Smash.

The cup shattered, and the tea spilled everywhere. Cassandra screamed and fell to the floor.

Benjamin's face changed instantly. Without hesitation, he lifted Cassandra into his arms and set her on the couch. ""Are you hurt?""

Cassandra leaned weakly against his chest, her voice trembling with grievance. ""I'm fine. I just wanted to talk to her. I didn't expect...""

""It's not your fault."" Benjamin's fingers twitched as he fought the urge to touch her cheek. His icy blue eyes shot toward Rosalie. ""You want a divorce, right? Fine. As you wish.""

He signed his name in bold, elegant strokes and tossed the papers at her. ""I hope you don't regret it.""

Regret? The only thing she ever regretted in this life was marrying him. That bitter thought flashed through Rosalie's mind. She turned to leave, but behind her came Cassandra's soft voice and Benjamin's low reply.

""Benny, you actually signed it? Aren't you afraid she'll really divorce you?""

Benjamin's tone held a hint of mockery. ""She loves me too much to leave. It's just a little trick to get my attention. Now, let me see if your foot is hurt.""

Rosalie's steps faltered. She turned instinctively. Under the dim light, Benjamin knelt on one knee, carefully holding Cassandra's foot on his lap. His expression was gentle and focused.

Germophobia? What a serious case of germophobia.

Chapter 3
The next morning, Rosalie went to the courthouse to file for divorce. When she returned to the villa, she saw Benjamin teaching Cassandra how to drive. His hand rested lightly on hers. The space between them was so small that the air inside the car felt charged with tension.

Rosalie suddenly remembered all the times she had wiped her skin raw with disinfectant just to get close to him. To Benjamin, his wife was nothing but a carrier of germs. If she wanted to touch him, she had to scrub herself clean first.

But... Cassandra was his exception. The one he treated like a holy item. Even if she were covered in dirt, he would still let her come close to him.

It is true that love always reveals itself. She was the fool for never noticing it.

Rosalie looked away coldly and walked toward the villa. But then, the sharp roar of a car engine suddenly sounded behind her. The next second, she felt her body fly into the air before crashing down like a rag doll.

A burning pain shot through every inch of her body like a red-hot iron. She lay amid shattered glass, choking as blood filled her mouth.

Through the cracked windshield, she saw what happened inside the car. Benjamin was holding Cassandra tightly in his arms, his face tense. ""Are you okay? Did you get hurt?""

Cassandra's voice trembled. ""I'm fine. But Rosa looks really hurt. Benny, hurry and take her to the hospital.""

Through her blurry vision, Rosalie saw Benjamin glance at her, his voice icy. ""No. She's covered in blood. It's dirty.""

Tears mixed with blood slid down her cheeks. Rosalie let out a broken laugh as pain spread through her chest, tearing her apart from the inside. She couldn't bear it anymore. Darkness closed in, and she passed out.

When she woke up again, Rosalie was in a hospital. Benjamin's face was tight with restraint as he reached out to help her. But then, as if remembering something, he took out his gloves and put them on. One pair wasn't enough, so he put on two more.

Pain stabbed deep in Rosalie's chest. She sneered. ""If you don't want to touch me, don't force yourself.""

Benjamin pulled his hand back and handed her the bowl of chicken broth the maid had made. ""Eat something first.""

Once, Rosalie would have been deeply touched. Now, it only felt like mockery. She said nothing, just quietly took the bowl.

When she finished, Benjamin's furrowed brows relaxed slightly. His voice was calm. ""Cassie's pregnant with Joseph's child. She wants to have the beef broth you make. I'll have the driver take you home so you can cook for her.""

So that was why he'd endured his germophobia, stayed with her in the hospital, and even brought her soup. Not out of concern, but because he wanted her... to cook for Cassandra.

Rosalie's fingers clenched under the blanket, fury boiling inside her chest. ""Benjamin, are you insane? She hit me with her car, and you want me to make beef broth for her?""

Benjamin met her bloodshot eyes. Something inside him twitched. He thought he was imagining it. His brows furrowed, his tone cold. ""She didn't mean it. The doctor said you weren't badly hurt and can move just fine. And it's just beef broth. How much effort could that take?""

Rosalie's chest heaved. She grabbed the water cup on the nightstand and hurled it at him. ""Get out! Get out of my sight!""

Benjamin dodged, irritation flickering across his face. He tore off his gloves and, as if offering her mercy, grabbed Rosalie's right hand and intertwined their fingers. ""Now, is this enough?""

Rosalie stared at him, tears streaming down her face and splashing onto the back of her hand, cold as ice. What kind of man had she fallen in love with? How could he be so heartless? How could he... humiliate her like this?

In the end, the bodyguards dragged her back to the villa, forcing her to make beef broth for Cassandra. When she was finally sent back to the hospital, her weak body gave out, and she drifted into sleep.

But before long, sharp pain shot through her wrist. Then, someone yanked her hard and threw her to the floor.

Chapter 4
Rosalie's back hit the cold floor hard. Sharp pain shot through her body, and cold sweat broke out across her forehead. ""Benjamin! What are you doing?!""

Benjamin's face was dark as night, the chill in his pale blue eyes almost solid. ""Rosalie, I could understand if you were mad that Cassie ran into you. But why did you drug her beef broth? Do you know she almost lost the baby because of you?""

Rosalie tried to get up, but the bodyguard twisted her arms behind her back and pinned her to the ground. Her cheek was pressed against the rough floor and her skin was burning, but it was nothing compared to the pain in her heart. She trembled with rage.

""Benjamin, if you're sick, go to a mental hospital! Stop making things up! Why would I drug her for no reason?""

Benjamin stared at her pale face, his cold eyes showing no pity. ""She didn't eat anything today except the beef broth you made. If you won't admit it, then stay put until you understand what you've done wrong.""

Fear flashed in Rosalie's eyes, her teeth chattering. ""No... Benjamin! You... you can't do this to me!""

The only answer she got was Benjamin's icy order. ""Take her down.""

Rosalie tried to fight, but the hands on her were like iron clamps. She was dragged out by the bodyguards toward the pool next to the hospital.

Splash.

Her body hit the water and was instantly enveloped by the freezing water. Rosalie choked on a mouthful of water that reeked of chlorine. Fire burned down her throat and into her lungs, leaving her gasping and unable to breathe. She called out instinctively, ""Benjamin...""

Through the rippling water, Benjamin stood still, his cold gaze even harder than ice.

Hopelessness filled Rosalie's eyes. She struggled to reach the edge, but her body felt as heavy as lead. Just when she thought she was about to drown, a bodyguard pulled her out and threw her at Benjamin's feet.

She was soaked from head to toe, her wounds tearing open again. Blood mixed with the pool water and formed a pool beneath her. Benjamin took a step back, his tone cold. ""Do you admit your mistake now?""

Rosalie coughed hard, her beautiful face white as paper. ""It wasn't me...""

Splash.

The next second, she was thrown into the pool again.

It happened again and again until she had no strength left to fight. She let herself sink. So be it. Let it end here. She didn't want to live anymore. The blue tiles at the bottom of the pool grew clearer, closer.

Just then, someone pulled her up once more. Through the ringing in her ears, she heard Benjamin answer a call. ""Have you investigated properly? It really wasn't her? Alright, I got it.""

Her trembling, wet body finally gave out. Everything went black as she collapsed to the ground.

Rosalie woke from pain. The sharp smell of disinfectant filled her nose. Agony spread through her body, her chest burning as if needles were stabbing her lungs. She let out a soft cry.

""How do you feel? The doctor said you have pneumonia. You'll need to stay here for two days.""

Rosalie turned her head and saw Benjamin sitting nearby. He was still in his black suit, cold and distant, untouchable as ever. But now, the eyes that were always cold held a trace of guilt.

""We investigated the matter. It really had nothing to do with you. The nurse mixed up the medicine,"" he said, glancing at her again. ""This was my fault. Whatever you want as compensation, I'll provide it.""

Rosalie didn't look at him. Her voice was faint. ""No need. If you really want to make it up to me, leave me alone so I can rest.""

She understood now that Benjamin had only ever cared about Cassandra. He only offered compensation because he didn't want her to cause any trouble for Cassandra.

Benjamin frowned at how lifeless she looked. Something stirred in his chest, a feeling he couldn't name. But in the end, he said nothing and walked out.

Maybe out of guilt, for the next few days, Benjamin came to the hospital every day, staying for half an hour each time. If this had been before, Rosalie would've been overjoyed. But now, it just felt like a cruel joke.

Chapter 5
Rosalie stayed in the hospital for a week. The day she was discharged, she accepted a friend's invitation to a private party. She didn't expect to run into Cassandra there.

When Cassandra saw her, she gave a faint, mocking smile and walked over holding two glasses of wine. ""Rosa, I'm sorry about what happened a few days ago. Benny just cares about me too much. This drink is my apology; consider it me making up for him.""

Rosalie didn't want to deal with her and turned to leave, but Cassandra stopped her. Cassandra leaned in close, her whisper in Rosalie's ear sounding downright cruel. ""Rosalie, don't you think you're like a dog begging for scraps? No matter how hard you try, Benny will never look your way.""

Rosalie's gaze turned cold. She shoved Cassandra hard and snapped back. ""If I'm a dog, then what are you? A widow sleeping with her ex-husband's brother while pregnant with her ex's child?""

Cassandra's face darkened instantly. Then, for some reason, she suddenly threw her drink on her own face, slapped herself hard, and dropped to her knees in front of Rosalie.

""I'm sorry, Rosa. Everything that happened before was my fault. But I'm carrying Joseph's baby now. Please, I'm begging you, don't make me drink.""

Rosalie froze. Before she could react, someone grabbed her arm tightly and shoved her hard.

Crash.

Caught off guard, she was thrown against a nearby coffee table. Cups and bottles shattered, splashing wine across her face and clothes. Several glass shards pierced her palm, blood spilling out. The sharp pain made her vision blur.

As Benjamin shoved her, he carefully helped Cassandra up, his face colder than ice. ""Rosalie, have I spoiled you too much? How dare you treat Cassie like that!""

Rosalie struggled to stand, looking up quietly into Benjamin's cold, merciless eyes. They had been together for three years. She had wished countless times that he'd touch her just once, without caring about his obsession with cleanliness. That day finally came, but only so he could hurt her.

She bit her lip until she tasted blood and spoke in a trembling voice. ""Benjamin, after all this time, so in your eyes, I'm nothing but a horrible woman.""

A flicker of doubt flashed in Benjamin's eyes. Cassandra's heart skipped, and she quickly forced a weak smile. ""Forget it, Benny. I don't think Rosa meant it. She just got carried away by jealousy for a moment. After all...""

Looking at Cassandra's teary face, Benjamin's hesitation vanished. His gaze toward Rosalie turned ice-cold. ""You love me so much that there's nothing you wouldn't do. Grab her. She slapped Cassie once, so give her 20 back. She needs to learn a lesson.""

Rosalie's eyes flew wide, pain crushing her chest like a hammer. So in his eyes, her love for him was her greatest crime.

""Benjamin! I didn't touch her! If you don't believe me, check the cameras!""

""No need. I trust Cassie."" Benjamin's tone was flat and cold. ""Rosalie, anyone who does something wrong must be punished. Even a three-year-old knows that.""

Fury filled Rosalie's eyes as she struggled to break free. The moment she moved, two bodyguards grabbed her tight. Their huge hands came down fast and hard.

Slap!

The sharp crack echoed. Rosalie stumbled, her cheek burning with pain.

Slap!

Another blow. Her head snapped to the side, blood trickling from her pale lips.

Two slaps. Three...

The private room went dead silent, except for the sound of non-stop slapping. At first, Rosalie still had the strength to argue, but after 20 slaps, her face burned like it had been branded. Even opening her mouth took effort. She collapsed to the ground and passed out.

Chapter 6
Rosalie had a nightmare. When she finally struggled awake, she found herself staring at Benjamin's cold, handsome face. He was wearing gloves, carefully applying medicine to her wounds with a cotton swab.

When he saw her wake up, he casually put the swab down and said flatly, ""Let's forget what happened. But if you ever bully Cassie again, it won't be this easy next time.""

Rosalie couldn't help but let out a low laugh. ""Benjamin, do you know what? I regret ever meeting you.""

Benjamin looked at her tear-streaked face, and something sharp flickered in his eyes. A strange restlessness rose in his chest. ""Rosalie, stop acting up. This was your fault from the start. Just 20 slaps. It was a light punishment.""

""Light?"" She asked inwardly. Her face hurt so badly it felt ruined, yet he said it was a light punishment.

""Leave. I don't want to see you again.""

When Benjamin met her lifeless gaze, his heart tightened for no reason. Something unexplainable made him speak again. ""Didn't you always want to sleep with me? As long as you promise not to bully Cassie again, I'll agree to sleep with you. That should make you happy, right?""

His tone was full of condescension, as if he were granting her the greatest favor in the world.

Rosalie gave a mocking smile, closed her eyes slowly, and stayed silent. In the past, she had shamelessly tried to crawl into his bed many times. But because of his germophobia, even when she stood naked before him, he never touched her.

And now he was offering to sleep with her? How generous.

But he didn't know... she didn't need it anymore. All she wanted now was to stay far away from him, so far that she'd never have to see him again...

That night, Benjamin really meant to keep his word and share her bed. She didn't bother to argue and used her period as an excuse to kick him out.

But when she went to the laundry room, she saw Benjamin washing Cassandra's underwear by hand. At that moment, it felt as if a thousand knives were stabbing her heart.

Benjamin noticed her stare, his expression calm and unbothered. ""Cassie's pregnant. It's hard for her to move, and she feels embarrassed asking the maid, so I'm helping her.""

Rosalie clenched her fists so tightly that her nails dug into her palms. Pain shot through her chest before she finally gave a small nod. She didn't even want Benjamin anymore. Why should she care whose underwear he washed?

She turned and began packing her things. After living there for three years, she had quite a few belongings. In the drawers were the gifts Benjamin had given her without much thought. The expensive jewelry he'd had his assistant buy. The ice cream he once bought her. She couldn't bear to throw away the box, so she kept it like a treasure. The couple photo stickers she forced him to take when they went shopping together. In the photo, Benjamin's expression was stiff, but the light softened his eyes.

Once, she thought those things were precious. Now, they just looked ridiculous. Without hesitation, she threw them all into the trash can.

Along with them was her love for him.

Chapter 7
For the next half month, Rosalie stayed home and didn't step out, only waiting quietly for the divorce cooling-off period to end.

Until one day, she opened a news alert on her phone. ""Malone Group CEO Benjamin prays to God for love.""

In the video, Benjamin climbed 3,000 steps on his hands and knees. Because it was raining, his expensive tailored suit was covered in mud, and his face, which was always clean and spotless, was smeared with dirt. But he didn't care at all, only bowed his head respectfully as he took the blessed bracelet from the priest.

In the comments, countless people were shipping Benjamin and Cassandra.

""I heard Benjamin and Cassandra were childhood sweethearts, but fate separated them when Cassandra married Joseph by mistake. Now that Joseph's gone, they can finally be together.""

""Doesn't Benjamin have a wife? I remember his wife is the prettiest woman in Chicago, Rosalie.""

""He never loved Rosalie. Last time, he even slapped her 20 times in public for Cassandra.""

Rosalie's fingers tightened around her phone, the ache in her chest completely numb. She suddenly remembered once begging Benjamin to go to an old church in the suburbs with her.

Benjamin said, ""Rosalie, it's a mountain road to the church. It's dusty, and there are too many people and germs. Stop being selfish and think about me for once!""

But now, he prayed to God for Cassandra.

How ironic. And how ridiculous.

Rosalie calmly closed the article and began packing her suitcase. Just then, the door burst open. Benjamin walked in, uncharacteristically tense. His gloved hand grabbed her wrist and dragged her toward the door.

Rosalie tried to pull away, but she couldn't. Helpless, she shouted. ""What are you doing? Let go of me!""

Benjamin's face was grim, his voice tense. ""Cassie accidentally hurt someone. The victim's family agreed to settle, but on one condition. They want someone to take the punishment for five days.""

Rosalie froze as the meaning of his words hit her, her face turning pale with fear. ""No... I'm not going... "" Why?! Cassandra made the mistake. Why should she take the blame?

Benjamin forced her into the car with unshakable strength. ""No, you have to go! Cassie is timid, and she's carrying my brother's child. Nothing can happen to her. Don't worry, they promised not to kill you. At most, they'll hurt you a little. When the time's up, I'll come pick you up myself. Besides, haven't you always wanted a child? If you take this for Cassie, I'll give you one in exchange.""

Rosalie's lips trembled. Her chest went numb, but tears still streamed down her face. How cruel. How ironic. She was his wife, and all she wanted was to have his child, but he wanted her to earn it by taking Cassandra's punishment.

So in his eyes... She was that worthless!

A sudden gust of wind blew away her tears and, with them, the last trace of love in her heart. She struggled wildly, screaming hoarsely, ""Who cares!""

But in the end, she couldn't fight Benjamin's strength and was shoved into the car.

When they arrived, Benjamin ordered his bodyguards to tie her up and throw her in front of the furious victim's family. ""I've done what I promised. Don't go after Cassie again.""

Rosalie turned her head and met the hate-filled eyes staring back at her. Fear gripped her heart like an iron claw. Her teeth chattered as she begged, ""Benjamin, don't do this to me! They'll beat me to death!""

Benjamin crouched down, gently wiping her tears with a handkerchief. A flicker of pity passed through his eyes, but his tone stayed cold. ""They won't. They promised me they wouldn't kill you. Be good, Rosa. I'll come for you when it's over.""

Rosalie clung to his sleeve, but he pushed her hand away without hesitation. Her trembling fingers reached helplessly toward him, unable to stop him from leaving. A helpless sob escaped her throat, her eyes turning red.

The family dragged her into a dark room, where fists and sticks rained down like a storm. Rosalie bit her lip hard, but couldn't stop the painful cries spilling from her mouth.

After that, she endured torment she never thought possible. They poured boiling water on her, burning her skin until blisters covered her body. They pressed lit cigarettes into her arms, leaving scars that spelled out ""criminal."" They whipped her with lashes soaked in salt water, tearing her clothes and cutting deep into her flesh. They even... sealed her inside a coffin with a rotting corpse for an entire night.

Just when she thought she'd die from the torture, the door was kicked open. A man stood against the light. His face was hidden and his presence was terrifying.

""Touch her again, and you'll pay for it!""

His bodyguards rushed in, taking down everyone in seconds. Then Rosalie fell into a steady embrace. Through her blurry vision, Oliver's cold eyes met hers, though his embrace was gentle.

""Rosie, don't be scared. I'm here to save you. Sleep now. When you wake up, everything will be fine.""

Tears filled Rosalie's eyes as she whimpered and leaned against his chest. Then everything went dark.

Five days later. Benjamin came as promised to pick her up, only to learn that she had already been rescued by a man five days ago.

A man? What kind of man? Benjamin asked inwardly. A strange frustration rose in him. He took out his phone, about to call her, but someone stopped him.

Cassandra hooked her arm through his and sighed, ""Why is Rosa so immature? Is she mad at you and doing this just to make you worry?""

Benjamin's finger paused above the screen. Cassandra's lips curved slightly as she continued, ""Ben, today is Oliver's wedding. Let's attend first. You can reach out to Rosalie afterward, right?""

Benjamin was silent for a moment before putting his phone away. ""You're right.""

But even as he said it, on the way to the hotel, he couldn't calm down. He kept checking his phone over and over. When they arrived, he finally pocketed it and looked toward the entrance.

A red carpet lined the hotel entrance, flowers on both sides, and at the end stood a huge wedding photo. Benjamin was about to look away when he froze, his gaze snapping back in disbelief.

When he saw the wedding photo clearly, he felt as if he was struck by a heavy hammer. He froze in place.

The woman in the photo had bright and flawless skin. Her red lips curved into a smile.

It wasn't just anyone.

It was his wife. Rosalie.

ECB QUIETLY UNVEILS THE FINAL CHAIN: DIGITAL EURO LOCKDOWN BY 2029  
  
In what central bankers are celebrating as the “crowning evolution of money,” the European Central Bank just confirmed the irreversible rollout: a fully trackable, programmable digital euro arriving no later than 2029, with pilot transactions and wallet seeding beginning mid-2027 - assuming the co-legislators rubber-stamp the cage in 2026.  
  
The captured ECB blog post spills the real agenda in polite bureaucrat-speak: cash is “going nowhere” (for now), but every offline-capable digital euro will still be issued, held, and revocable by the ECB itself.   
  
Translation: no one outside Frankfurt will ever transact anonymously again once merchants and banks are forced to accept it everywhere.  
  
They admit the quiet part out loud: Europe’s payments are currently “dominated by non-European providers,” and that makes the continent a hostage in a “polarised and fragmented world.”   
  
Their solution isn’t competition; it’s total control.   
  
One public ledger to rule them all, designed from day one to “reduce external dependencies” and guarantee the EU can freeze, limit, or tax any citizen’s spending in real time without begging Visa, Mastercard, or - God forbid - Washington for permission.  
  
No more unapproved donations. No more cash under the mattress when the next “temporary” capital controls hit. No more buying a coffee or a car without the algorithm knowing your exact carbon footprint, political loyalty score, or vaccine status.  
  
They promise it will “complement” private payment apps. It won’t. The moment holding limits, negative interest rates, or “emergency climate quotas” become politically convenient, every private wallet will be throttled until the digital euro is the only one that still works.  
  
Cash isn’t being replaced. It’s being gently, legally, permanently suffocated.  
  
2026: the law.  
  
2027: the pilots.  
  
2029: the switch flips.  
  
Welcome to the open-air digital prison they’re calling “strategic autonomy.” Your money was the last freedom they hadn’t fully taken.   
  
They just told you the exact date.

1pihhap,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1pihhap/has_anyone_been_diagnosed_with_lpr_following_a/,Has anyone been diagnosed with LPR following a viral infection?,"I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read the longer version - but the question is pretty simple. Have any of you developed LPR after a viral infection destroyed or weakened your tissue?

I want to start by saying I have not seen an ENT to confirm what I have yet, though I believe it to be LPR. I understand I absolutely need to do and I hope to soon, but money is very tight at this time. 

 I believe it started following a catching a viral infection sometime in late July/Early August of this year. I went out with some friends one night, a couple days later felt that 'globus sensation' firstly.. followed by a very slight cough and then eventually some congestion and a runny nose. I didn't test for anything as it was all mild and basic cold symptoms. But I never usually suffer from sore throats or coughs, I don't think I have since I was young, so it was odd I felt the globus feeling, but I brushed it off as a start of a sickness thing, and technically I was right. That mild cold lasted a week or so and then I was good to go. It's worth mentioning I had taken up a hobby of fragrances (cologne) for a few months prior and I've been told that could have primed my throat tissue to become sensitive to such a force like a viral infection. 

After I had recovered from the cold, I noticed this odd feeling of that globus sensation sticking around sometimes at random times, and often a feeling I remember describing as a feeling similar to post nasal drip which I'd never felt before myself but made sense after hearing what it feels like. I originally felt like I just had excess mucus lingering from the sickness and continued waiting it out for my body to heal it and move on. 

A month later, I had a weird two week spell of some sort of GI issue. A feeling of a dull pressure in my stomach area (mostly my bottom left stomach area, but it would be in different spots sometimes). This freaked me out thinking I had some constipation issue or something. I took miralax, senna tea, etc all to no real resolve. I incorporated some probiotics to my diet and tried limiting my diet but not sure what helped out in the end. One day, I just returned to eating some junk food and had the best BM I'd had in weeks and that was that. Maybe it was a covid GI issue, if I ever had covid, or maybe it was something I ate / was taking. I don't know. Maybe not even relevant whatsoever to LPR at all. 

The globus sensation was a sort of rare thing for me going forward, but often I'd still have that mucus feeling stuck in my throat. I couldn't stop myself from bringing up mucus into my mouth in a reverse swallowing method and spitting it out. Nothing painful, just annoying and overstaying its welcome. I reached a point where I felt like I went days not really thinking about it or noticing it to sometimes having a bad day or two in a row. Eventually I started taking saline sprays / rinses and I believed they were helping to some degree but in retrospect they really weren't. I was never congested or anything, just trying to calm down the mucus production. 

Around October, now 3 months later, I discovered nasonex and firmly believe that was helpful since starting it despite not being a miracle. I was convinced what I had going on, after chatting with a doctor online in a brief consultation, was a sensitive tissue lining following a viral infection. That, by staying hydrated and resting it will repair on its own eventually and to stay away from fragrances and highly acidic things that would irritate it. In her words I was still 'in the normal range' for anyone still struggling from this and it wouldn't be much longer, especially if I followed the protocol amazingly well. 

I'd brushed off the idea of it being LPR whatsoever because I don't have any of the classic signs of anything related to hers or anything else. I otherwise feel 100% ok! Just this annoying nasal drip feeling and a rare globus sensation now and again. And during this entire time period my diet had never changed much. I stopped caffeine and switched to decaf coffee in the AM (i know) and I otherwise don't really think my diet changed much (not a great diet but not awful either). 

On thanksgiving, after spending the day with family for the majority of the lunch into the night, I felt absolutely great. When I got home, I realized I was feeling the globus sensation worse than I had in a long time, if ever. Immediately I went into a mini panic and took everything I could to try and think of a way to prevent this from getting any worse - allergy meds, the acid reducer chews, nasonex, a saline rinse, etc. I made a food journal of the day as I had a lot of foods and surely one of them must be the one I'm allergic to or something. I did have lemonade, a few zero sugar sodas, some dried food and was exposed to hair spray and cologne for the day. 

Please don't laugh, but I eventually turned to AI for a bit for help. I find AI comforting when I'm left with questions and struggling to find direction to turn towards feeling optimistic again. I've not been chatting with Google for over two weeks. Google AI is convinced I had a post viral infection issue that did permeant damage to my larynx tissue and has now given me LPR symptoms and threw me on a diet now if very bland foods. I'm on day 5 today of water, chamomile tea, plain oatmeal, toast, rice, bananasz broccoli and tofu. I don't know if I feel amazing yet but if I'm repairing 4 months of bad diet after getting LPR, it probably needs a lot more time to heal and for the globus irritation to wind down and get off high-alert mode. Google swears in a few days, especially weeks, the diet will limit the high-stressed larynx tissue and allow it to heal which will reduce the globus indefinitely and allow less of the nasal drip feeling. 

So far... I've never burped often, I don't have a cough, no heartburn, no weird taste in my mouth. The only LPR symptom I have, apparently anyways, is certain foods being a trigger but I haven't noticed a convincing pattern as I've had many good days in a row while on a bad diet (I literally ate an entire pizza and a bottle of soda no more than two weeks ago and felt nothing after). But there's been times it's hit me some hours following eating some chocolate. I'm also pretty sure my cheap candle in the past flared me up too, so I think fragrances also irritated that sensitive area. 

I will see an ENT soon when I can comfortably spend that money. For now, I appreciate anyone reading this and with any input. It's so odd to just one day hear you may have gotten sick and the damage it did was enough to give you a lifetime illness that will forever change your diet and lifestyle. Learning I may have to give up alcohol,.coffee and chocolate forever is devastating to me. I was under the impression once my tissue healed, I'd get back to feeling how I was earlier with no issues with anything whatsoever, but digging deeper into this.. even after this bland diet test ends, I may never be able to reintroduce certain things again or fear continuing this whole cycle again. 

I know everyone's different with this but any comments or questions is appreciated. But following this sub for a while I realize I have had a much more minor version of it, while eating a ton of the bad stuff for it, not using medication whatsoever, and still been able to have many normal days. It still leaves me believing I don't have an acid issue whatsoever but it's the only thing left that makes any logical sense.

My gf has been to Paris, London and Athens, and now I am excited to take my first euro trip with her!

She is not super partial to anywhere, she enjoys traveling, and so do I.

So I make this post looking to you all for some help and narrowing down our options.

Some background info and context:

* We have a budget of about $5,000 (total), for food, travel, lodging, transportation, activities etc. It is close to a hard budget.
* We really love history, museums, food, coffee, pastries and breads. As well as reading, and books.
* I really love soccer/fútbol, and Jiu-Jitsu.
* I also am an academic, so places with cool universities are a plus. Or libraries.
* We speak English, and poor to okay Spanish. Spanglish for the other Nuyoricans heres.
* However, we will be flying out of Chicago not NYC.

So far I have pegged down the usual places, such as London, Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam, etc, especially as those all seem to fit based on our interests.

However, I was hoping to get some more help in narrowing it down, based on you all's more in-depth knowledge of day to day costs. We will also be traveling in Late March 2026. Looking to go for about a week.

So really any info on what options might be best for the week, why X is better than Y because are staying a week, or going in March, things like this are all helpful. Along with any budgeting or financial insight. I am bit of a hyper-budgeter so any depth on this front would be really helpful, to help me compare and contrast, among our interests, and things like weather, and time of year etc.",1,1765310045.0,Shoestring,0,1.0,False

What is a fun activity? Basically anything you'd normally do in your free time, as long as it's legal and in a public place. Here are some examples: coffee hangout, lunch, pickleball, beach yoga, bike tour, festivals, golfing, shopping, bowling, or anything else you enjoy doing. 

Why would somebody pay to do an activity with you?

* People are very lonely
* People travel to international destinations alone and want to experience things with locals
* People already like connecting with creators online through social media
* People seek alternative communication/socializing outside of the standard channels of therapy, friends, family, and coworkers
* People are getting a level of online fatigue, doing things IRL is funner
* People have niche hobbies/interests that their friends may not want to do with them

Basically you'd have your own personal link and you can offer any legal/safe activity, completely free. You choose the rate too, you keep 100% of what you charge. We have systems in place to monitor both hosts and customers to ensure we keep the community safe and healthy.

1pih7wa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pih7wa,Big ole box of Botulism.,"So second post of the day is the spread of the 1967 Ham and Lima Bean MCI.

Right off the bat. I didn't attempt to eat any of the components (other than smoking a cigarette). I don't currently have health insurance, so I'm not going to roll the dice with a near 60 year old ration.

I also didn't open the cheddar cheese. There is no good way to open it without destroying the can, and it looks cool as is.

All cans and packages were opened from the bottom, and cans cleaned for display. The MCI box is unfortunately best to hell, but it could be worse. Spoon and seperstor were missing, but it's not a huge loss.

The B-2 Unit came out with a few broken crackers with 
Some brown and black flecking on most of them. The cheese can is perfect. The can itself is not dented, and there are no noticable rust or pinholes inside.

The Pecan roll was packed TIGHT. I was able to coax it out onto a tray. It smelled okay until I broke it in half, it has an overly sweet tangy/spicy scent. The can itself isn't dented, but there is some rusting inside the can.

The accessory pack was perfect. Unopened and all contents included. The creamer is hard as a rock, so it remains unopened. The coffee is probably good, and I may open it at another date. The gum package is amazing, so I'm going to keep that intact, I already reviewed the Newports. Nothing much else to say about the other components.

Now what we are all waiting for. The Ham and Lima Beans. I wore gloves and a face mask with my prescription glasses. Glad I did, the can didn't appear bulged, but as soon as I pierced the can, some contents spewed forth, so there was some decent pressure in there. No denting on the can, no pinholes, but there is a spattering of rust inside the can. 

While I was expecting a stench to emanate, I really didn't notice anything remarkable about the smell. The appearance...well. The Lima Beans are staggeringly large, and are in a greyish, goopy, almost cream of mushroom consistency sauce. There is a large mass of ham that cuts pretty easy, and would probably be spreadable on the crackers, but overall looks pretty unappealing.

Thanks for reading y'all!

1pih6xd,https://labornotes.org/2025/12/red-cups-raised-rebellion-starbucks-strike-spreads,"Red Cups Raised in Rebellion, Starbucks Strike Spreads","Several hundred more Starbucks baristas walked out last Thursday, the 22nd day of their growing unfair labor practice strike. It is now the longest strike the coffee giant has faced, spreading to 145 stores in more than 100 cities.

Kingston, New York, baristas joined the strike early Thursday, and management didn’t even bother trying to open the store. So the workers, joined by supporters, picketed a nearby store in Lake Katrine, piercing the crisp winter air with chants of, “What’s disgusting? Union-busting!” and, “I want to eat food and pay rent at the same time!”

Starbucks Workers United, the union representing 12,000 baristas, is asking customers to shun all Starbucks stores for the duration of the strike. They had not previously called for a boycott. The company is big, and the 550 unionized stores account for only 5% of the company’s 10,000 U.S. outlets. Starbucks is the second-largest fast-food company in the world.

“I want to eat food and pay rent at the same time!”
In Lake Katrine, several would-be customers turned away from the drive-through, and others who had prepaid mobile orders pledged not to return for the duration of the strike. After a morning on the picket line, some workers drove to New York City to join a rally at the Empire State Building, where there is both a flagship Starbucks Reserve store (serving espresso martinis) and corporate offices.

In Manhattan, 500 rallied with giant red cups saying “Baristas on Strike,” and signs comparing CEO Brian Niccol to the Grinch. Twelve workers and supporters sat down to block the iconic building’s office entrance. They had asked for a meeting with executives in their offices above, but were met with silence. The police immediately warned that they would be arrested if they didn’t move, then arrested all 12, while a press scrum snapped photos and the crowd chanted, “Shame!”

The strike started with 65 stores on Nov. 13, then escalated with 30 more a week later, while five more stores — in Maryland, Virginia and Arkansas — filed for union elections. Workers turned away trucks delivering to Starbucks’ largest distribution center in York, Pennsylvania, on Nov. 20.

New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders joined a Brooklyn Starbucks picket line on Dec. 1. They blasted CEO Niccol, whose pay is 6,000 times that of the average barista.

‘Understaffing, lousy pay’

After four years of organizing, Starbucks workers are still trying to get a first contract. Negotiations progressed for eight months, then stalled last year. The company has racked up a record number of labor law violations since 2021, with an additional 125 charges filed by the union since January.

Baristas said the main issues are pay and scheduling. The average store worker makes $15.25 an hour and works 19 hours a week, said Rami Saied, who works at a store in Brooklyn. “That is not a livable wage,” Saied said.

In bargaining last year, the union proposed minimum pay of $20 an hour, with 5% raises each year, while the company proposed no immediate increase and 1.5% raises in future years.

“We’ve been consistently clear on what we need,” said Rey Shao, a barista at a store in the Financial District, at the NYC rally. “We need more take-home pay, we need better hours … Bring us new proposals that actually address these issues so we can finalize a contract.”

The company has racked up a record number of labor law violations since 2021.
Saied said that the raise they’re asking for would cost “less than they spent to send all store managers to Las Vegas to have this huge retreat [in June] .… It shows how little they care about us that they are not willing to negotiate over that amount.” The managerial shindig cost $80 million.

At a practice picket in October, baristas chanted, “Understaffing, lousy pay! This is how your coffee’s made!” Mima, a barista at a store in downtown Manhattan, said she regularly stays until 2 a.m. to finish closing up. She said that on the previous Sunday there had been only two workers on the floor between 5 a.m. and noon, “which made it difficult for us to keep up with customer demand, and to take our legally mandated breaks.”

Long waits in some stores lead to frazzled customers. Mima said it’s management policy. “Even when understaffing isn’t so egregious on the weekends, it is still difficult to keep up with volume as is.”

Had to pay up

Starbucks’ grueling scheduling practices have also run afoul of New York City law. On Monday, the company agreed to shell out $38.9 million for violating the city’s Fair Workweek statute. Management “arbitrarily cut workers’ hours, involuntarily kept them in part-time work, and failed to provide predictable schedules,” according to the city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection.

Starbucks’ grueling scheduling practices have also run afoul of New York City law.
Workers report that the company keeps their schedules below 20 hours a week, the threshold where it starts providing benefits, and denies requests for more hours, preferring to hire additional hours-starved, part-time workers. That’s been illegal in New York City since 2017, when retail workers won the Fair Workweek law after enduring years of scheduling that created chaos for employees trying to go to school or raise a family or even go on dates.

Many retail outlets had adopted software that predicted store traffic based on weather and other factors, and manipulated workers’ hours to conform to just-in-time schedules — calling them in without notice for surprise shifts, short shifts or dismissing them early. Under the law, workers are entitled to know their schedules two weeks in advance and managers have to offer current workers more hours rather than hiring.

The law has provided some relief, and the Starbucks settlement is the largest to date. As many as 15,000 workers from 300 stores will get $50 for each month they worked under illegal conditions between July 2021 and July 2024.

I finished in 2 hours what normally takes me all day.

The constant ""quick checks"" were destroying my focus without me even realizing it. Every time I picked it up to glance at a notification I lost 10-15 minutes. Not just to the phone itself but to the mental reset of getting back into what I was doing.

When the phone wasn't an option my brain had no choice but to stay on task. No escape route. No distraction waiting in my pocket.

The work didn't get easier. I just stopped sabotaging myself every five minutes.

Phone addiction is normalized because everyone has it. But that doesn't mean it's not a problem. It just means we've all agreed to pretend it isn't.

Shame he ran out an hour ago. Down to his last cigar. The type far too cheap, the type those crooks down at city hall would never be caught smoking. Ones he didn't even have to bother cutting, and the one he had now been lighting.

""Please tell me you have good news."" The Detective not even bothering to look at the officer that had been quick to make his way towards the desk, left to exhale a plume of smoke.

""They said it was best for you to see it first hand."" Words he did not want to hear. Words that forced him to sit up, and leave his seat.

""Fine, But you're driving. I need to get a bit of shut eye before I end up doing something I'll regret."" 

Didn't even feel like he had a chance to catch a bit of shuteye by time they arrived. Downing that day old cup of coffee now that he felt his attempt to sleep had caused more harm, then good. Damn near walking into the truck those two he had in custody abandoned. Something about this place felt familiar. One that left him with a sense of deja vu as he called out to one of the senior officers

""We been out here before?"" Seemed his question had fallen on deaf ears.

 Had he been a little more awake, he might of noticed how pale the officer's face had been. Might of noticed one of the officers had become so sick they had to run off behind a tree. Might of noticed all of them had been looking up at the top of the very same tree.

Ran through, Left impaled upon branches long enough they might as well of been pikes. How cherry red had been the muscle and sinew left exposed, Having been stripped of their birthday suits.. Or just maybe how the fat looked as if it had been left to melt like wax, to form stalactites from which blackened blood now drip. Or how about the one the Detective had tried to look in the eye. One that had been forced several inches from the socket, to stare from the end of the branch that it had become stuck.

Silent the detective had been as he made sure to meet the gaze of each and every one that had been left to meet such a gruesome state. Slow he had been as he made his way around the tree. Looking as if they had been there less then a day. One might be quick to blame those two he'd been fed up with. Only problem was he'd been dealing with them since yesterday. The detective had yet to decide if this had been the handy work of the one they called Skinner, Even if the handy work had been similar, This wasn't quite the same, Having been looking in the eyes of one, it became clear whoever had done this, had wanted them to suffer.

Kraking Boom of The Detective's Revolver heard. One that left his arms whipping back the moment it had been fired. What had been left of the upper body left to slide free from the branch. That slapping, gushing of innards spilling out of the body as it fell, To land at one of the officers feet. All it took to break those free from whatever spell had been cast. Fear for one turning to rage.-

""What in god's name do you think you're doing!, Even for you this is extreme!""  The Senior officer would scream. Forgetting just whom he had been screaming at in his moment of rage.

""If you all hadn't been standing around pissing yourselves instead of doing your job, Might of noticed that poor bastard was still alive."" How apathetic his tone had been.

""Then just maybe I wouldn't of had to put him out of his misery."" How quick did the red in his face drain. How quick that rage had been stripped away.

Reaching into the inner pocket of the trench coat he wore, he had been reaching for something that had not been there. Turning his attention towards one of the officers so shaken they couldn't even manage to light the cig between the lips. One now taken for his own as the snap of his lighter would be heard.

""Well, What the hell are you all standing around for? Get your asses moving and get these down to the morgue!"" His attention turning towards the one that had been shot down. 

Something about the flesh still warm to the touch, left to steam beneath the cold air that autumn would bring. Gloves hand lifting an arm, to take a closer look at the body. Suppose them being alive might of been what kept the scavengers away. Though The Detective didn't buy it. No discarded skins of their last victim, No grizzly totem. Not like when they first opened this damn near cold case. 

Standing now, The sound of chopping caught his attention as he now yelled out.

""The hell are you doing, We need those bodies back in one piece"" -Something none had been expecting to hear, after what The Detective had done moments prior.

""And where the hell did you get those axes?"" -Both pointing towards the tree the officer had ran behind.

""There Sir."" If looks could kill, That would of been the trade mark look this detective gave through his squinted gaze. 

""You two, I want your assess up in that tree, Tie a rope to them and cut those damn branches down! ""

""Rest of you, group up and spread out."" Detective couldn't even finish the smoke before one of the officers had yelled out.

""Over here, Found something."" Detective really wasn't expecting much at this point. Least not what was found.

""You three, with me."" -Quick to sprint off now that he found a second wind. Following a trail left by a body being dragged. Having brushed aside the pine needles, to expose the muddy prints left by a single child.

One left staring out the interrogation room window. One that left him with a view of the rest of the station floor. To watch the few that would remain behind as the rest had been quick to leave in a hurry. Watching one that had been left to stand in front of bars that others had been sitting behind. Ones that had been dressed far differently then all of those that had dressed the same, dressed in blue. Having been some time since he watched the two that had not been the same, be carried away. Watching that would be stopped by the shuttering of blinds. A woman having been standing there, with drawstring in hand. A woman the boy was now left to watch. 

""It's nice to see I've finally managed to get your attention."" 

Having been the first time the boy had look at her since she had entered an hour ago. How patient she had been, waiting as she had asked her questions. Questions that had been ignored time and time again. Questions she had been trying to ask for the better part of the day. Something about this boy's stare had left her with an odd feeling she couldn't quite place. 

 She still couldn't believe this had been the same child they had brought in. Just how long had this child been out in those woods for hair that looked as if it once made of bark and moss, to have been strands that looked as if they had been made of Silver. So pure it would glow white in direct light. Forced to cut it down until only fuzz had been left. 

None could explain how their had not been a single scratch, or blemish on skin that looked as if it had been made of porcelain, With how hard they had to scrub to remove the layers of mud that had been a quarter inch thick in places. Hard enough it could of been mistaken for a plaster cast. Even after being cleaned up, one might have trouble knowing just which gender this child had been, Had it not been for the clothes he was left to wear. 

""Do you understand what I am saying? I would like you to touch your nose if you do."" 

The woman in blue left to watch the boy whom only answered with a blank expression.

""Do you know what a nose is?"" Once more, She would be given no answer. 

""Let's try something a little different."" Left now to look into her bag, Searching for something she could use to draw. Pulling a pad of paper free along with a pencil.

""I know you can't understand me, Bu- "" The boy had been watching her now, as he touched the tip of his nose. 

Pad and pencil tossed atop the table now as she set her bag down. She couldn't help but feel this boy had been testing her as she spoke.

""I don't suppose you know what words are?"" The boy had given her an answer, one that had been a silent stare. 

""Did no one ever teach you how to speak?"" Again the boy gave no answer, as she now broke away from his stare, Only for this child to give her a single, softer spoken word.

1pigymc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1pigymc/my_friend_just_got_fired_form_my_job_and_i_cant/,My friend just got fired form my job and I can't tell anyone that I am happy about it,"Hello. English is my second language and I don't feel like checking grammar. Enjoy. 

As the title say. 

A little introduction - I (24F) work in the same job as my friend Annie (22F). We met in the second year of college 4 years ago and we are friends since. She has this job because I called her that there is an opportunity like this during summer break and she accepted 

She just got her information today that her contract won't be renewed after new year. She works on very specific contract - so whenever she doesn't feel like coming she can just call and tell with no consequences. But she doesn't have a guaranteed hours. She has a higher  salary per hour han me though. Officially she is part timer. 

So Annie works until end of December and I can't tell anyone how happy I am about it. Like I love her but there a few ""BUT"": 

1. She slurps EVEYTHING. Three coffee a day, one water cup, her two meals a day, a fucking candy I gave her. 

I am extremely misophonic and she knows it. I tried to talk to her about it (for example If she could go to eat in another room or I could go. Or if she could just swallow her soup without slurping) BUT SHE DOESNT LISTEN. IT MAKES ME INSANE LISTENING TO IT 32 HOURS A WEEK 

2. Annie doesn't know when to shut the fuck up. I told her hey be careful around our coworker Cosmo. Cosmo was recommended by someone from HR and is reporting our every move to them.

And yet she still tried to have a super private convo about my father in front of him (he was alcohol addict and abusive Annie knows it.)  and when I shut her down cause I don't want any romours about it SHE GOT MAD. 
ANDSHE GOT MAD WHEN I SHUT HER DOWN ABOUT MY ANNOYANCE FOR MY OTHER COWORKER. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK 

3. Annie is way to often on break. 

She has 3 coffies per a day, 2 meals in office and a bottle of water. And ""fanfic breaks"". 
 I also tried to talk to her about as well how annoyed I am that I am working and she is chilling. Her reaction? 
""It's not like it's gonna run away. And no one sees it anyway. It's just a job. Relax"". Also she didn't understand why I scolded her for reading a fanfiction FOR AN HOUR. 

There were days that she was in work 8 hours but worked only 3 and all her work ENDED UP BEEING MY EXTRA WORK. SHE LAUGHED ABOUT 

The only ""break'"" I talked her out from was a ""poop break"". Like she used to come around 8 and go straight to the bathroom for 25 min to poop... And probably read fanfiction. She has exactly 20 min walk to her SINGLE ROOM WITH BATHROOM dorm or 5 min long bus ride. We have only 2 bathrooms per 35 employees and she blocked one for 25 min EVERY SINGLE. DAY. But you could say oh but there isn another free bathroom... WRONG. One of our coworkers is pregnant and she occupies it most of the time (as she needs it). 

4. She refused to back me up when I needed to show something to my supervisor. Like she will complain but she refused to lend me her support and talk about it out loud. ""I don't feel like intefere you got it anyway"" 

LIKE FUCK ME. I AM SO HAPPY THAT ITS OVER. 

And yes we are friends because she has other strengths: she is incredible good with work when she locks in, she is very good at solving problems, she is creative, honest and loyal to the bone. 

But yet I am goddamn happy that she is leaving in January. And I can't stop feeling happy and like a bad friend at the same time because of it.

I know I should be eating earlier and sometimes I do, but the 4pm goal really helps to motivate myself to eat at least a snack before dinner time. The only consistent safe snack I’ve had for well over a year now is Harvest Snap pea crisps. I have been having trouble with some inconsistencies in the texture, but recently had my partner check the dates on the bags to see if it was just a weird batch and it was. All day today I’ve been hyping myself up to eat before 3 because I have an online psychiatry appt at 3 and wanted to be able to think clearly. I just went to open the bag and noticed a box cutter rip in it. It was my last bag. I am so devastated right now. This isn’t the first time this has happened at this grocery store, but it’s our only local-ish grocery store. I know I could ask my partner to really check the bags in the store, but the store should be doing that! I used to work in a grocery store and we did quality control as we stocked the shelves. Someone could get seriously ill from food in damaged packaging. I’m just so done with today and was already having a hard day and I just want to scream. If you’ve read this far, thank you for listening, I appreciate you 💖 I have health issues that unfortunately get a lot worse from me not eating and I know now that the rest of my day is going to be unbearable because of this. I guess I’m having a cup of black coffee and a cigarette for lunch to ward off the hunger pains. I hate this existence so much😓",3,1765308962.0,ARFID,0,1.0,False

‍

**Why This Pick?**

This might be an unpopular opinion, but I trust the Knicks far more than I do the Raptors to cover. Toronto has really cooled off over the last couple weeks having lost 5 of their last 6 games, while the Knicks have comfortably won 7 of their last 8. I know NY typically fares better on their own court, but with the Raptors having lost their last 3 straight home games, I’m not in a rush to back them against a juggernaut like the Knicks. My money’s on the visitors to cover, friends.

Right now, I’m using **Fedora KDE 43**, but my system occasionally feels heavy — sometimes it lags, freezes for a moment, or the mouse cursor disappears for a few seconds.  
I also use **Antigravity**, and that sometimes causes noticeable lag as well.  
So I’m looking for something smoother for my hardware.

**My Hardware (Lenovo desktop):**

* **CPU:** Intel Core i3-8100 (Coffee Lake, 4 cores)
* **GPU:** Intel UHD 630 (Mesa / i915)
* **RAM:** 8 GB
* **Storage:** 7200 RPM HDD (no SSD)
* **Monitor:** 1366×768

**My Usage:**

* Coding (VS Code, Git, Java, Node.js, simple backend work)
* Heavy browsing (multiple tabs)
* General multitasking throughout the day
* Running small automation or utility scripts
* Light crypto-related tools
* **Occasional Android emulator usage (mostly light apps and modded APKs, not heavy 3D games)**
* Basic video streaming inside apps
* Prefer smooth performance with a lightweight desktop environment

**Question:**  
With this hardware and use-case, which Linux distro would offer the best balance of **performance, stability, and day-to-day usability**?  
I’m specifically looking for something that runs well on an HDD-based system.

✦

The kitchen lights made the Diaz house look like morning even though it felt like a hangover. Star set a glossy white box on the table like a trophy. The price sticker still clung to the corner, stupid and loud: $649.99.

“It’s refurbished,” she chirped, cheeks already pink, cheekmarks trying to pretend they weren’t tremoring. “Princess Turdina royalties hit and I thought—listen—if we pull shots at home, we save on Stardrops, which is like… destiny math!”

Marco stared at the box, then at her, then back at the little parade of bills he’d been lining up like defeated soldiers. Power. Internet. Insurance. His mouth did that tight thing it did when he tried not to be mean.

“Star,” he said, and he didn’t raise his voice because he never did. “That’s my money.”

“Ours,” she tried, too quick. “We’re a team—”

“Then our team needs the internet not to get shut off.”

Her smile flickered, bright-bright-dim. “I can flip it! We’ll content it—foam stars, glitter sprinkles, ‘Charmed Cold Foam’—I’ll make a spreadsheet—”

“I don’t need a spreadsheet.” He set his hands flat on the table like he needed the wood to keep him upright. “I need a break.”

Silence landed like a plate.

“From me?” she asked, and it came out small.

“From the noise.” He swallowed. “From fixing everything before we even feel it. I love you. I’m tired. And I’m scared I’ve turned into the net under you while the floor is still on fire.”

Cheekmarks ghosted. Her hands shook and she hid them in the apron. “So… what. You’re done—because I bought a coffee thing?”

“It’s not about the coffee thing.”

“It feels like the coffee thing,” she said, and she breathed like the therapist taught her—four in, six out—even though she hated doing it when he could see. “How long is a break?”

“I don’t know.”

The fridge hummed. The clock ticked like a metronome trying to teach them both a song.

“Fine,” she said, blinking fast. “I have a shift.”

She took the box with her like she could still make the math work if she held tight enough. The door clicked, and the kitchen felt like it exhaled.

***

The white Subaru slept under a eucalyptus in the mall lot, windows fogged from inside, a cat-shaped shadow loafed in the passenger footwell. Janna blinked awake to knuckles on the glass. Beanie low. Hair everywhere. Brain loud.

She cracked the window two inches. Cool air, old fries, eucalyptus.

“Hey,” Marco said, soft. “Urban camping?”

“Communing with asphalt,” she deadpanned. Holly *mrrrped* hello like a tiny judge.

“You hungry?”

“What are you, the Snack Police?”

“Deputized this morning.”

She sighed like surrendering to food was morally complicated. “Fine. But if this turns into a Very Special Episode, I’m stealing your wallet.”

“Deal,” he said, because she always did anyway.

They crossed to the diner with their usual choreography—his hands respectfully not reaching, her eyes tracking exits without looking like she was tracking exits. The booth felt like a raft. Coffee showed up that didn’t ask questions. Her stomach screamed one long Yelp review at the universe.

“You look like you slept in a tax document,” she said.

“Conversation with a spreadsheet,” he said. “We broke up. Or—paused.”

“Ouch.” She cut her waffle into quarters like cartography. “You okay?”

“Allegedly.”

She flicked syrup off her fork. “Then here’s your free Janna consultation: pick one true sentence. Say it. Shut up. No TED Talk. No emo monologue. ‘I love you and I’m tired’ counts. Then leave before you over-explain.”

Marco huffed a laugh into his cup. “Less therapist than I expected.”

“I’m allergic to therapy-speak,” she said, spinning the fidget ring with her thumb. “I break out in sarcasm.”

His phone buzzed under the table. He didn’t look. Hers buzzed too. She glanced.

> **Marco:** You good?

She answered with a screaming possum meme labeled “SELF-CARE” and a loaf-of-cat emoji. He snorted. It helped.

They ate. Quiet did that thing where it was company instead of punishment.

***

Bullseye’s back room smelled like cardboard and orange cleaner. Marco tightened his lanyard and tried to live inside the beep-beep-beep of the handheld.

“Sir Diaz,” Alfonzo announced, piloting a pallet, “you look fiscally haunted.”

“Breakup,” Marco said. “Also found Janna sleeping in her car.”

Angie showed up at the endcap with a basket and that Mom Look that read sons and receipts. “You good, mijo?”

“Long day,” he said. “Star and I hit pause. And Janna—” he rubbed the back of his neck— “she’s in the lot. With Holly. It looks… normal. Like she’s practiced.”

Angie’s face went soft and fierce. “Then she’s staying with us.” She tossed chips in the basket. “She practically already does. Girl raids my snacks like it’s a sport.”

“Mom—”

“Spare bedroom,” Angie said, decisive. “I’ll make the bed. Tell her it’s not a rescue. It’s Tuesday.”

Marco exhaled like somebody loosened a knot between his ribs. “Thanks.”

“Hydrate,” she said, poking his arm. “And tell Rafael to put the frog key on the hook.”

“What frog key?”

“The one Mariposa’s been guarding like a dragon,” Angie said, already walking away.

***

Janna dozed in the Subaru with the precision of someone who’d learned how to sleep anywhere. The eucalyptus did fake rain. Her pacemaker clicked like a teacher tapping a board—steady, exact—whenever her chest tried to sprint.

Knock-knock on the roof. She cracked the window. Marco crouched, hoodie up, hair damp with mist.

“Angie says you’re taking the spare bedroom,” he said. “No arguments.”

“Spare—” She blinked, recalibrated. “This a trap?”

“It’s a Tuesday.”

She thumbed the fluorite through her hoodie; the little click under bone said breathe. “Fine. But I’m buying my own snacks. And if your house eats me, I’m haunting you.”

“Noted.”

He slid a bag through the gap like contraband: turkey sandwich, chips, banana. “Field ration.”

She side-eyed the contents. “On brand,” she conceded. She split the chips with Holly and hated that the sandwich was good.

“Off at seven,” he said. “Text me if you need anything.”

She sent a raccoon stealing a slice of pizza. He smiled, tapped the roof, left her to the quiet.

***

Stardrops pulsed with caramel air and fluorescent cheer. Star worked the bar on muscle memory: tamp, lock, steam, pour, smile. Through the kiosk glass, Bullseye’s doors sighed open and Marco crossed the concourse. From a side corridor, Janna appeared with a crinkly GoodHome bag.

Star watched them with the detached precision of a magician forced to sit in the audience. Janna handed him the bag like an offering. He peeked inside and laughed. Janna lifted a brow, pleased in that deadpan way that always, always got to people.

*Why does she look safe*, Star thought, and hated the shape of it.

Her phone buzzed where she’d shoved it under the counter.

> **Pony Head:** babes?? breathe!! u have “gonna make a scene” eyebrows

Star pressed her thumb to the inhaler bulge inside her apron like a talisman. She typed: *I’m FINE. No scenes. Calm talk later.*

> **Pony Head:** proud. hydrate or I’m spritzing u with Evian across the mall 💦

Star laughed; traitor, tiny, real, and slid a perfect heart into a latte she didn’t look at while she did it.

***

Seven o’clock poured itself over the lot in sodium amber. Marco tapped two knuckles on the Subaru’s roof. Janna surfaced with pillow-crease cheek and the softest scowl.

“Come home,” he said. “Spare bedroom.”

“Define ‘home.’”

“Garlic rice and a door you can close.”

She stared out at the lot, then at Holly, then thumbed the fluorite. The inner click was steady. “Fine. But if Mariposa gives my frog key a hat, I’m suing.”

“Unavoidable,” he said.

He texted Rafael the plate number; Rafael texted back a thumbs-up and EMPLOYEE STORAGE from the night manager. The Subaru would live to see morning.

The drive was easy. The kind you don’t talk through. At the Diaz house, the porch light threw a warm circle, and everything inside smelled like lime and noodles.

“Hi, mija,” Angie said, dishtowel over shoulder, already setting out a bowl. “Shoes off. Soup’s hot.”

“Permission to import one cat and zero chaos,” Janna said, hovering.

“Cat has diplomatic immunity,” Angie said. “Chaos can park itself.”

Rafael peered around a cabinet door with a tiny brass hook and a screwdriver. “For the frog key,” he announced. “Mariposa insisted.”

Mariposa skidded in and remembered to walk, solemn with a sticker sheet. “Pick one,” she told Janna. “For armor.”

Janna pressed a glitter frog onto the rubber key cover. Ceremony complete. Holly bonked Mariposa’s finger through the carrier grate like a royal blessing.

Angie slid a deep bowl of *sopa de fideo* in front of Janna, put a plate of limes at her elbow, and pretended not to watch the temperature come back into the girl’s face. “You know the drill,” Angie said. “Restroom’s where it’s always been. Spare bedroom’s made. Text if you need anything or just yell; we haunt back.”

“Yes, ma’am,” Janna said, mock-saluting with the spoon. The first sip hit like a small sun. She winced at her own eyes.

“Noodles make everyone cry at least once,” Angie said. “House rule.”

Janna nodded, a little dazed. “Rude, actually.”

Marco hovered in the doorway, hoodie half off his shoulder like he couldn’t decide between staying and disappearing. “Uh,” he said, awkward in that Diaz way. “Spare bedroom’s yours.”

“I already burglarized it in sophomore year,” she said. “We’re good.”

He grinned, relieved she’d said it first.

***

Stardrops shuttered to metal clatter. Star stood under the neon sign and made herself smile before she hit call so her voice would sound like a smile.

“Hey,” she said when Marco picked up. Night city noise, the river somewhere, the hum in her chest. “Do you have a minute?”

“Yeah.”

“You took her in.”

“She was sleeping in a parking lot,” he said. “I’m not… not doing something.”

“Can you not see her for a while?” It came out gentler than she felt. She pressed the inhaler against her palm like a secret. “Just until I don’t feel like the floor moved and forgot to tell me.”

Quiet crackled. “I’m not cutting off my friend,” he said. “But I hear you. We can… keep it human. Calm.”

She counted breaths like the occupational therapist taught her. Four in, six out. The prickly at the edge of her scalp eased. “Okay,” she said. “Okay.”

“We’ll talk tomorrow,” he said. “Sleep if you can.”

“Yeah.” She swallowed. “Night.”

“Night.”

She stared at the dark kiosk glass until her reflection fuzzed into the river air. Pony Head texted, *u scream?* Star sent back, *no. small win.*

***

The spare bedroom was small and already looked like her somehow; a borrowed hoodie on the chair, frog key on the new brass hook, a lasagna pan that was now a litter box like a joke the house made to itself. Janna stood in the doorway and let her brain slow.

Holly did one slow lap and decided the foot of the bed was hers. Janna touched the fluorite at her collarbone, then the faint seam of her scar like taking attendance. The pacemaker kept time—*click, click*—patient as a teacher.

“Temporary exile,” she told the room. “Deluxe package.”

In the hallway, Angie whispered something to Rafael in the language of people who’d already decided to be kind. Mariposa pressed a frog sticker onto the doorframe and declared it protection. Marco set a charger on the nightstand, face down, no speech.

Janna flicked Do Not Disturb on and sent Marco one more meme—an ancient low-res GIF of a goat fainting, captioned IT’S CALLED COPING. From down the hall, his laugh came back quiet and honest.

She killed the lamp. The room exhaled. The little click in her chest held the beat steady.

“Okay,” she said to nobody and Holly and the house. “We live here now. Allegedly.”

Holly purred like a small engine. The frog on the key winked green in the dark. Outside, eucalyptus pretended at rain, and the Diaz place did what good houses do: it kept its people warm while they figured out the rest.

1piglr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1piglr8/2year_affair_shes_withdrawing_im_losing_myself/,"2-year affair, she’s withdrawing, I’m losing myself. How do I move forward?","Sorry in advance for the long post, I think I’m reaching out because I don’t really know who to turn to (throwaway account for this reason).

I’ve had an AP for almost two years with someone I work with. We both have long-term partners (mine 10 years) and are both in our early 30s. It started slowly, built emotionally, then physically. At its peak a few months ago, she told me she loved me, couldn’t stop thinking about me, and wanted to be with me once she found the courage to end things with her SO. I really fell in love with her too, it almost became a bit obsessive. But I never found the courage to break up with my SO. To be honest, I know my SO is so so good for me it’s just that sexually we don’t connect anymore.

This started from a place of feeling emotionally and sexually starved in our relationships. At times, it’s been the best experience I’ve ever had with a partner. Previously, we texted every day for probably 18 months. We would go for a coffee in work or to the pub after work. Our connection, conversation, intimacy and sex have all been something I’ve never experienced. Over the last year, we have had a repetitive cycle of emotional closeness, sex, guilt, retreat, silence, back again. The guilt aspect is something she has felt. Her emotional inconsistency and ability to compartmentalise have always been things I’ve really struggled with as it didn’t match my needs.

We were better than ever in September but then her work life blew up. Job instability, and huge stress that meant she needed emotional stability at home so pulled back from me. I helped her through her work issues and she was appreciative but the dynamic totally changed. 

Since then, she’s become really distant. Slower replies, emotionally closed off, vague, avoidant. She even said “let’s have no pressure and see what happens”. She would leave the odd crumb to draw me in and then it felt like she’d shut the door.

Whereas I’ve been falling apart. I’m in a long-term relationship that is safe, stable, loving — but the emotional and physical intensity with my AP completely derailed me. My libido is only triggered by her, not my partner. I check my phone constantly. I think about her all day. It’s obsessive and draining. My mental health and work focus are suffering.

Recently, me and my AP didn’t speak for about 10 days and when we finally met for a coffee at work, she acted normal. I apologised for going quiet and explained I was trying to protect myself. She said thanks and moved on. There wasn’t any emotion at all and I can tell things have shifted for her.

Since then, we’ve barely spoken. We’ve spoken at a work-level but she has doubled down on pushing me out and stabilising things with her SO. Part of me thinks she’s letting the connection fade without having to say it. Another part thinks she still cares but is shutting down emotionally to manage as she’s been through a difficult period. Either way, I am really suffering. I feel disrespected and disposable. I feel stupid for believing it meant as much to her as it did to me.

I’m reaching a point where the pain outweighs the fantasy. Where I’m angry at the emotional limbo she’s kept me in. Where I want to tell her I can’t do this anymore but I’m terrified of actually letting go. I hate how much control this has had over my life. To be honest, I don’t really know what I expected.

Has anyone been in this situation before? How did you detach? How did you detach? How did you stop checking your phone and fantasising constantly? Did you confront them for closure or just fade out? How do you actually start to move forward when you still see the person at work?

I agree with him in a sense. I do think she came across as more of an assistant during that time (getting him coffee, not speaking up in the meetings etc.). However, it was only a 2 week internship. Even at my normal job, learning the ropes took a while (more than 2 weeks!) so I’m not sure it was fair feedback especially since he wasn’t there for a lot of it and she seemed a lot more confident/go getter when he wasn’t around. Also when they meet the first day, he asks if she’s ready to shadow him which comes across as a passive role in my opinion. And even if the feedback was accurate, he could have presented it better like “here is how you can grow” instead of “you’ll never make it. I did you a favor”.

And I hate myself every time I look in the mirror: fat, round, chubby face. I hate the speculations of people pulling my cheeks because they are so puffy and round, despite the hundreds of times I told them to stop respectfully. The last time, I was so fed up that I threatened my friend to cut her fingers off. She took that sarcastically and still does it. My cheeks are a reminder of how ugly I am.  
  
And yes, I am not just fat, I am ugly as hell.  
  
No, you never saw me, so please don't sugarcoat me with affirmations and what modern psychologists say. I've been practicing that for a couple of years, knowing deep down I am lying.

I might look OK in my housewear, but when I wear my hijab and modest clothes (skirt sets), I look 100 times fatter and uglier. Today's modern fashion isn't tailored to the obese body type.  
  
Yes, I am fat. I apologize for being fat, I apologize for being an eyesore, for being pathetic and longing to be a better, good, good-looking person. For the last couple of years, I've been visiting dieticians, getting diagnosed, attending gyms and classes.

Nothing is wrong with me medically (al hamdellah).

I weigh 95 kg, I am 160 cm tall. Fifty-two percent of my weight is muscles and the rest is ugly fats accumulated after years of eating cheap food (indomie/fast ramen) or not eating till I reach home in the evening. I was broke, and cheap stuff like Indomie or packaged croissants kept me on my feet to survive college.

Anyway, it is my fault; if there is truly a health police, I should've been sentenced to death. I tried, and I am still trying, but losing weight is sooooooooooo freakkkkkkingggg uglyyy and HAAARD. I REPEAT, IT IS HARD!!  
  
My family took the weight-scale job, monitoring my look every day to note a change. If I ate a low-calorie chocolate bar (sorry for loving chocolate in a bitter world), I would get smirks and mockery comments from them.

Suddenly, all of our cuisine is high in calories (I am Lebanese), and boi, you try telling that to a Lebanese mother who'd insist it's a ""me problem,"" not her food problem. Like, yeah, I can measure my plate and eat whatever I want, right?  
  
But if we stop kidding ourselves, I won't get full if I eat a spoon of yogurt, 1/4 of pita bread, with 1.5 drops of olive oil. Please, this is starvation. In addition, I can't bring my own food, my own vegetables and whatso, as I cannot tell my family not to touch them. That's a jerk move, but I cannot pay for everyone's vegetables and food as well. I have my share of house bills (yk eldest daughter's thug life). There is a month when I am paid generously, and another month I am searching for liras (cents) here and there to collect a bus fare.  
  
And my Lord, gyms are so expensive… 50–60–150$ PER MONTH!! (Again, I am Lebanese: hyperinflation, Israel war, corrupted people, and low-paying jobs.) I tried doing training at home, but it is depressing (remember my nice family), and if I go into a gym full of empowered middle-aged ladies (I am 25), minding my own business, they start giving me advice that I should take care of myself, when I get pregnant, I need to be strong and bla bla bla.  
  
Like THANK YOUU?? I needed you to tell me that, because I surely don't have a mirror at home. Oh wait… I do cover my desk mirror with a TV so I don't see my whole fit. The headshot is enough to fix my hijab, and my eyes are solely focused on my head and never my face.

In July, I locked in… I really, really locked in… I went as low as eating 1151 calories per day and lost 4 kgs, but it took me 2 months with long walks everyday. And as life does not pause while I am trying to be a better person… let's just say it was the worst period this year. Mind you, this diet did have some chips and a couple of chocolate bars, but never surpassed the 1151 threshold.  
  
Only to gain these 4 kgs back in 2 weeks when I loosened up a bit… and here’s what struck me: on top of striving to lose all the fat, you have to maintain the weight. A life prison of self-starvation and anxious eating.  
  
Which is ironic, as I definitely believe I have an eating disorder, not the pretty one tho. In my childhood, we were left for days or weeks eating zaatar and drinking water, till my loving, caring father returned after disappearing with roasted chicken or fast food and having us running like beasts. Thank God my parents got divorced, and I never hear from that psychotic man. If I can vouch for one thing modern psychologists say, it's that eating disorders are linked to past traumas.  
  
Which I don't understand: why, after all these years, where I can say, thankfully, I am secured and never hitting that rock bottom again, I still have the urge to eat or I'll starve… I just realized this recently while having a hars,h honest conversation with myself. Why am I failing and others have it a breeze?

And ohh, don't get me started on those effortlessly skinny, fit girls who complain at every breath they are on a diet because they gained 200 grams, eating bland grains with skimmed milk beside me, while I am eating a cheese sandwich (halloum and cucumbers) because I am not a psycho. I swear I feel like they are giving me side eyes for having what I'm 90% sure its a healthy breakfast.

After I gained that weight, I honestly gave up. I went back to drawing (I am a freelance illustrator) and locking myself with my favorite characters and working on projects. Eating whatever I eat, whenever I feel like it: chocolate, coffee, biscuits, chips, you name it. Whatever is easy to grab and cheap, and doesn't require me to feed the whole family.

However, I am still fat. And ugly. I avoid taking pictures with friends, I ask people to remove my photos with them, hiding behind ""personal reasons"" while it's just my insecurity, which is a personal reason.  
  
It only got cold here last week. Through the fall season, I kept wearing my summer outfits, and now they are all worn off. I have to buy a couple of sets and go through the trouble of finding my size, akhh ya Allah................

Welp, at least I won't get pregnant. As no one has looked in my way except fy or creepy beggars/refugees… so sleep peacefully , gym ladies.

Anyways, after this long rant… I am not giving up. However, I will aim to only lose 1 kg per month and survive Ramadan without additional weight. I will go to fitness classes 3 times a week as I found an affordable gym (like 35$), three classes per week (no, I don't need more, I have a life), and hopefully lose 25 kgs in 3–4 years (as I know my period stabs me in the back).  
And if I happen to be gone before reaching that weight goal, I want them to write ""At least she tried"" on my tombstone.",1,1765308022.0,Hijabis,4,0.67,False

Would a 100% platonic “hang out with a friendly local” thing actually be helpful for solo travelers?
Coffee, museums, walkable exploring, talking story — zero romance, zero weirdness.

Or is this one of those ideas that only works in movies and not real life?

If you’ve traveled solo here, what do you think?
Sweet idea or total delusion? 😂

Any tips?","I love coffee and drink several cups a day, up until now I have tried different cheap variants of coffee makers (just regular ones) and other ways like using a napolion coffee press etc. I have always had the thought of getting a real proper automatic coffee maker when I got the funds for it and recently got one (the Philips 5400) and was really excited to try out all the different flavours and coffee variants. It seems to fit me extra well since I actually like a lot of milk in my coffee and when I go out I always pick the Coffee Latte so the milk dispenser seemed like gold to me.

To say that the actual experience with the 5400 was underwhelming is putting it lightly. I have tried all the different coffee variants on it and they all taste very bland and ""watery"", even after increasing the coffee strength with the interface. The only one that taste good/ok is the regular coffee one where I put in milk on the side manually after it is done (so not even get to use the fancy milk dispenser)

I don't know why the rest all taste so bland and underwelming?

Also the machine is so noise, but maybe that is normal. But I often have to leave the room when it starts brewing and I kind of feel guilty for turning it on to my neighbours and would never run this at night.

The only real positive thing and it is really positive, is that it is super easy to clean.

I’m currently planning my next few months of working remotely from abroad, and I’ve always found planning the exact costs tricky.  It’s easy to find the cost of a flight, but estimating the actual monthly cost of living in a new city (Rent + Coworking + Food + Data) feels like a guessing game sometimes.

I’d love to know how you all handle this:

* Accommodation: Do you rely strictly on Airbnb monthly discounts, or do you have other sources for finding mid-term rentals that don't break the bank?
* Workspace: How do you budget for workspace? Do you just factor in the price of coffee at cafes, or do you set aside $200-$300/month specifically for coworking passes?
* Hidden Costs: What are the costs that usually catch you off guard when you arrive in a new country? (e.g., expensive SIM cards, tourist taxes, visa runs).

Meanwhile, because I was frustrated with manually researching costs for every single city, I  built a tool to help estimate these specific travel-work expenses (rent, coworking, etc.) all in one place.

It’s called [remoteworkbudget](https://remoteworkbudget.deskhop.work/) so give it a try if you want to.

I’d really appreciate any feedback on whether the cost estimates feel accurate to those of you currently on the road!",1,1765307534.0,workforcemanagement,0,1.0,False

I said hello and she said hey and then we were walking opposite ways. I turned around and so did she and she smiled at me and then again a second time. I should’ve taken action in that moment and just asked if she’d be interested in getting lunch or coffee or something. I finished getting my last items and as I was walking toward self checkout she was ahead of me walking the same way. I didn’t want to approach her at this point cuz we were around a bunch of people. Maybe it’s not that deep but I don’t like making a scene. I asked the cashier for a plastic bag. And then she approached the cashier saying something and laughing. I think she had said she’d be right back.

Now, I’m walking out of the store and my friend calls me so I stop outside and I’m on the phone for about 15 minutes and after we hung up I realized the girl didn’t come out. I’m thinking hmm… maybe she works there? But she was wearing all black so I was like nahhh a slim chance perhaps unless she works at the Starbucks but that’s right by the door and I didn’t see her when I walked back in. My friend had asked me to buy him this air hockey table so I said eff it I’ll go do that and maybe do one round in the store in case I see her maybe I could ask her out. I didn’t end up seeing her and I don’t wanna be a weirdo. Sometimes, these type of situations are missed opportunities and it’s better to go.

I get back to the self checkout with the item and the same lady is there and just told me to come checkout in the lane. So upon finalizing my transaction, I asked her if she remembered the girl from earlier and I gave a description but she was kind of just smiling but said wasn’t sure. I don’t know if she thought the story was just some cute thing because she was a little bit older, or if she knew something. I don’t think you can tell customers if someone works there anyway but I am hoping to run into her again and see if she’d like to get to know each other.

In these current times, so many people are meeting on apps… and even though I know there are people who find their partner on there, it’s kind of not for me. It doesn’t feel natural or whimsical and I feel like that plays a part in the potential development of chemistry between you and the other person because the foreshadowing of intention from dating apps I think does more harm than good. I just really liked this interaction we had. It reminds me of when I was younger and people used to just approach each other and be friendly. Not to say that doesn’t still happen but social media has really made people a lot more reserved. I beefed it 😩

1pig11l,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1pig11l/how_carnivore_helped_resolve_lifelong_undiagnosed/,How carnivore helped resolve lifelong undiagnosed electrolyte imbalances,"Hoping this may help others. For the majority of my late teens to adult life, I have struggled with what I believed to be panic attacks. Episodes involving shortness of breath, rapid heart beat, sweaty palms, feelings of needing to get up and pace back & forth, frequent burping, and muscle weakness. They were only occasional, often times a few times in a week followed by long stretches without incident. They’d last anywhere from 30 minutes to a couple hours. There were never any clear triggers except that they’d often happen soon after eating, from a few minutes up to a few hours. 

GP visits, urgent care visits, lab work, never gave me answers and docs told me “go to therapy”. For most of my life, I’ve been pretty well-rounded and I have participated in therapy. No change to these very physical symptoms.

Fast forward to a few years ago when I began a slow & gradual shift toward an on & off again lower carb, then keto, then carnivore diet. I’d have fatigue & general achiness (but not exactly cramps) at times. Others I’d feel mostly fine but then experience those panic attack-like episodes. Never both at the same time. 

As I learned more & more about diet and specifically ketogenic/carnivore diets, I learned about electrolytes and specifically electrolyte deficiencies during transition periods (which unfortunately happened regularly as I struggled to be consistent thanks to cravings, routines, family eating habits, etc). 

So I figured out an unflavored electrolyte blend and started making almost daily. I felt GREAT. Energy levels through the roof. Achiness gone. Less carb cravings. The whole gamut. Also included magnesium glycinate supplements.

Before long, some of these great feelings fell off and boom, panic attack symptoms returned. More research & blood tests (electrolytes in normal ranges but on the lower end of normal) came to the conclusion that I needed more electrolytes. Kicked up to 2-3 electrolyte drinks a day. 

I’d rapidly go back and forth between feeling great and feeling off with panic attack symptoms. I didn’t understand because blood tests shows normal electrolyte levels. Must be something else? Doctors can’t determine - all labs normal. 

After one particular weekend of eating a very salty meat dish all weekend, I had some of the worst panic attack symptoms yet. Decided to cut electrolytes and added salt. Back to feeling great for a while!

Within a few days, achiness, fatigue, cloudy mind all returned, but no panic attack symptoms. I tried very small amounts of salt and water. Instantly better.

I started learning more about electrolytes, particularly, particularly that blood serum levels really do not reflect what’s going in the kidneys and the electrolyte balance in your cells.

Not unlike the way being carb free for some time taught me how to truly read my body’s hunger signals, I started to truly understand when I needed more electrolytes, particularly salt, vs when I didn’t. 

I’m now several months without panic attack symptoms and when I start feeling a little fatigued, achy, cloudy, a pinch of salt and some water down the hatch and it’s like I drank a cup coffee. 

As I understand it, an individual’s electrolyte needs can vary radically. I happen to be very sensitive to too much or too little 

My point here is that electrolytes, especially salt, can have a dramatic affect on your overall well being and if like me, you have dealt with decades of never feeling consistent day to day, a big part of it could be electrolytes in addition to general diet. 

Just like your hunger signals with a carnivore diet, it may be well worth really getting in tune with your electrolyte needs!",8,1765307067.0,carnivorediet,7,1.0,False

1pify4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasBookClub/comments/1pify4q/the_9_habits_of_top_1_women_sciencebacked/,The 9 habits of top 1% women (science-backed strategies that actually work),"Everywhere you scroll lately, there’s someone shouting about how to be “that girl.” You know, the iced coffee + sunrise Pilates + perfect skin combo. The problem? Most of it’s aesthetic. It’s curated performance, not real transformation.

As someone who’s studied and researched high performers, especially women navigating male-dominated fields, I’ve seen that what actually separates the top 1% isn’t what they wear or how they meal prep. It’s habits. It’s mindset. It’s how they think and move through chaos. And trust me, the real strategies aren’t cute or viral, but they work.

Most viral advice skips the science. But this post? It’s backed. Behavioral psychology, neuroscience, performance research, plus some uncomfortable truths your favorite influencers won’t tell you.

Here are the 9 habits of top 1% women. Broken down step-by-step.

---

### 1. Ruthless internal clarity

Top 1% women aren’t confused about who they are. They know their values, what they stand for, what they won’t tolerate. This makes decision-making automatic.

- Use the “two-word self” test from Harvard’s Dr. Robert Kegan: if you had to define your entire identity in 2 words, what would they be?
- Research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology shows that identity clarity correlates strongly with lower anxiety and better life satisfaction.

This isn't journaling once a month. This is deep identity work. No clarity = no power.

---

### 2. Protects energy like it’s sacred

They don’t wake up and pour energy into everything. They protect their attention like billionaires protect their money.

- Cal Newport (author of Deep Work) emphasizes time-blocking over to-do lists. Focus is a finite currency.
- The most elite women avoid “micro-leaks” of energy like doomscrolling, gossip, mental rehearsals of fake arguments.
- They use tech tools like Opal or Forest to firewall distractions.

If your brain is open tab chaos, you’re not “busy,” you’re bleeding performance.

---

### 3. Trains her nervous system

What’s common in top 1% women? Calm. Under stress. Under attack. While multitasking. Basically, regulated nervous systems.

- Stanford’s Huberman Lab podcast repeatedly emphasizes the power of deliberate breathing and visual anchoring for stress control.
- They aren’t addicted to the high of panic. They train their body to stay in parasympathetic mode even in high-stakes moments.

Apps like Insight Timer have short somatic sessions for this. This is the real “glow up.” Your stress response is your edge.

---

### 4. Builds identity-based habits

They don’t rely on “motivation.” They build systems around who they believe they are.

- James Clear’s Atomic Habits makes it clear: the most powerful habit change is identity-based. You don’t run, you are a runner.
- They start small and stack. One change every 90 days. That’s it. No all-or-nothing burnout.

Try Finch app. It gamifies small identity-aligned habits and gives emotional support too. Surprisingly cute and effective.

---

### 5. Strategic about relationships

Top 1% women aren’t surrounded by chaos. They audit their circle often. Boundaries are strategy, not drama.

- Psychiatrist Dr. Julie Smith warns that being around “low vibration” people tanks your emotional bandwidth (her YouTube channel is a goldmine).
- They optimize for reciprocal energy. If someone is a “listener tax,” they exit early and guilt-free.

They treat social energy like calories. Not everything deserves consumption.

---

### 6. Speaks powerfully (and minimal)

They don’t overexplain. They don’t shrink. They speak clearly and with intention.

- Communication researcher Deborah Tannen found that women are socialized to be indirect. Top performers unlearn this fast.
- They use what linguists call “low-context” speech. Clear. Bold. Minimal qualifiers like “just,” “sorry,” or “kind of.”

Watch Vanessa Van Edwards’ TEDx talk on charisma cues. Your voice is a resume.

---

### 7. Reads like their life depends on it

Top 1% women read. Constantly. They don’t wait for experience, they borrow wisdom.

Insanely good reads that changed how thousands of women operate:

- This book will make you question everything: The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest. Bestseller. Therapist-turned-author Wiest unpacks self-sabotage in a way that feels like a spiritual slap in the face. It's part healing, part psychology masterclass. The best book I've read on emotional resilience.  
- For mastering boundaries: Set Boundaries, Find Peace by Nedra Glover Tawwab. Major NYT bestseller. Tawwab is a licensed therapist who makes boundary-setting practical. Legit the best book on saying no without guilt or chaos.

These aren’t cute aesthetic books. These are weapons.

Also worth adding: BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia University and former Google AI experts. It generates personalized audio podcasts and adaptive learning plans from top books, expert talks, and research papers. You can customize the length and depth of each episode, and even pick the voice that suits your vibe. 

Unlike generic book summary apps, BeFreed actually helps you internalize what you learn through a structured, evolving learning plan. It’s been a game-changer for replacing social media time with real, science-based growth. Essential for any lifelong learner.

---

### 8. Stops apologizing for ambition

They say what they want. They don’t soften it. They don’t seek permission.

- Research from Stanford Business School found women who openly express ambition are rated more competent, even if they are perceived as “less likable.”
- They refuse to make themselves small in rooms. They ask for what they want and expect to get it.

Start with the podcast The Bossbabe Podcast. They interview high-achieving women weekly. You’ll see ambition isn’t the exception. It’s the baseline.

---

### 9. Actively seeks discomfort

They don’t wait to “feel ready.” They move fast toward hard things.

- Adam Grant, in Think Again, shows that mentally flexible people (those who constantly unlearn and relearn) are top performers in any industry.
- They keep a “discomfort quota,” asking: what did I do this week that scared me?

One trick: write down the things you’re avoiding every morning. Pick one. Do it first.

---

This isn’t about being perfect. It’s about running habits that keep you in power no matter the chaos. The truth? Top 1% women aren’t lucky or genetically different. They just operate on a completely different OS.

Three days later the company's entire system crashed and I had 89 missed calls begging me to come back.

I worked as the sole IT systems administrator for a mid-sized family logistics company for six years. The owner's son took over as CEO two years ago when his dad retired. He's 31, never worked anywhere else, got handed everything. I'm 29 and built their entire digital infrastructure from scratch when they were still using paper invoices and Excel spreadsheets.

About four months ago I asked for a raise. I was making 62k in a city where that barely covers rent. I knew the company revenue had doubled since I automated their systems. I scheduled a meeting with him and his sister, who's the CFO. She's 28 and just as entitled.

I walked in prepared. I had documentation showing how much I'd saved them, how many hours of manual labor my systems eliminated, everything. I started explaining and he cut me off.

""Let me stop you right there,"" he said. ""You do basic IT work. Anyone with a computer science degree could do what you do. You're easily replaceable.""

His sister nodded along. ""We've been discussing this actually. Your salary is already generous for your skill level.""

I felt my face get hot. ""Basic IT work? I built everything you use. The inventory system, the client portal, the automated billing, all of it. From nothing.""

He leaned back in his chair. ""And we appreciate that. But maintaining systems isn't the same as building them. You're essentially a glorified help desk at this point.""

""Fine,"" I said. ""Then you won't have any trouble replacing me.""

His sister laughed. ""Are you threatening to quit?""

""No threat. I quit. I'm done."" I stood up.

He actually looked annoyed, not worried. ""You need to give two weeks notice.""

""For someone easily replaceable? You'll be fine."" I walked out, went to my desk, and started packing my personal items. I didn't touch any company property. Didn't delete anything or sabotage anything. I just took my coffee mug and my photos and left.

That was a Friday. My phone was quiet over the weekend. I figured they were scrambling to post job listings.

Monday morning I woke up to 12 missed calls from the office. Then 8 more during my shower. By noon I had 47 missed calls total and my voicemail was full. Every single message was either the CEO, the CFO, or Karen from HR.

I didn't call back.

Tuesday it got worse. 31 more calls. Text messages. Emails with subject lines like ""URGENT"" and ""EMERGENCY - CALL IMMEDIATELY."" The CEO's messages went from ""We need to discuss your unprofessional behavior"" to ""Please call us back, we can talk about compensation"" to ""Name your price.""

I still didn't respond.

Wednesday morning at 6 AM someone started pounding on my apartment door. I looked through the peephole and it was the CEO. He was still in pajama pants and a wrinkled polo shirt.

I opened the door with the chain still on. ""What?""

""The entire system is down,"" he said. ""Everything. We can't process orders, we can't access client information, we can't send invoices. We've lost three days of business.""

""Sounds like you need an IT person.""

""I'm sorry, okay? I was wrong about the raise. I'll double your salary. Triple it. Just please come back and fix this.""

""You said I was easily replaceable. So replace me.""

""We can't find anyone who understands your systems!"" His voice cracked. ""We've had four different IT contractors look at it. No one can figure out how anything connects.""

""That's because I built custom integrations. It would take someone months to learn it all."" I started closing the door.

""Wait!"" He actually stuck his foot in the gap. ""My sister wants to apologize too. We both do. Please.""

""Move your foot.""

""We'll make you a partner. Equity in the company. Your name on the building. Whatever you want.""

Here's where it gets messy. I found out later through a friend who still works there what actually happened after I left. The CEO had immediately called his dad and bragged about ""standing firm"" with me and not ""giving in to my demands."" His dad apparently asked who was going to handle the systems and the CEO said ""anyone can do it, that's what he told us.""

Except the dad knew better. He'd hired me six years ago. He knew exactly how much I did. He told his son he'd made a massive mistake but the son ignored him.

Then Monday hit. A server update I'd scheduled months ago went through automatically. Except it needed manual configuration afterward, which I would have done. Without that configuration, it triggered a cascade failure. Everything went offline.

The contractors they called couldn't fix it because they didn't have documentation. I'd always kept documentation, but it was stored in my head and in password-protected files they couldn't access. The systems were custom enough that standard fixes didn't work.

By Wednesday they'd lost approximately 340k in delayed orders and two of their biggest clients had threatened to leave.

Standing in my doorway, the CEO was basically having a breakdown. ""Please. I'm begging you. Tell me what you want.""

I pulled out my phone and opened my voice recorder. ""Say you were wrong.""

""What?""

""Say you were wrong about me being easily replaceable. Say it clearly. I'm recording.""

His face went red but he said it. ""I was wrong. You're not easily replaceable. You're essential to this company.""

""Now apologize for insulting my work.""

""I apologize for insulting your work and undervaluing your contributions.""

I stopped recording. ""I'll come in as an outside contractor. My rate is 500 dollars per hour with a 40 hour minimum. Payment upfront. Once the system is fixed, I'm done.""

""That's 20,000 dollars!""

""And you've already lost 340k. Your choice."" I closed the door.

He paid it. I fixed their system in about six hours, billed them for 40 anyway, and left. They've called me 11 times since then offering permanent positions with absurd salaries. I declined every time.

The dad called me personally last week. He apologized for his kids and offered me a position working directly under him at his new consulting company. Better pay, better hours, and I'd be working with someone who actually respects what I do. I start next month.

But my family is split. My mom says I should have just gone back and been grateful for the raise offer. My brother thinks I was petty for making him beg. They keep saying I burned a bridge and acted unprofessional.

Was I wrong for not just accepting their apology and going back?

Befriends people at coffee shops, talk to people on the street, whenever we’re together I notice how people just get dragged in and mesmerised of her. 
It makes me happy for her, but shamefully jealous too. I have social anxiety and have 2 friends,ish, I love being social though but somehow it’s very hard for me to get friends, people tend to not notice me and ignore me. For example when we hang out together I almost feel like a third wheeler. It doesn’t help that I’m horrible at telling her about it and she usually forgets how I feel forgotten about in social situations. 

I don’t like being jealous, especially cause she isn’t doing anything wrong. What should I do?


(Also reasoning why I posted this, my partner and I had planned in to watch a show over Christmas, but turns out she has plans with her class, to travel to some other country over Christmas and watch the show with them. So I’ll watch the show by myself. Which I understand and I’m okay with it. I don’t mind watching by myself and it seems like a fun thing for her so why would I tell her not to do that. 
I guess I just feel quite a hint of sickening envy that she gets to do it with friends and how she can talk about the show to friends ect. Even though I introduced her to it because I wanted to watch it with her.)

I have a state job and own a one bedroom condo. Aside from that, I feel like my life serves no purpose whatsoever. I've been single for 13 years and can't even remember the last time I went on an actual date. I keep trying one dating app after another to no avail (full disclosure: I've been on Ok Cupid, Hinge, Tinder, Plenty of Fish, Zoosk, and Bumble. I'm currently using Facebook Dating and Coffee Meets Bagel). I'm 6'2"" and 282 lbs. While I'm not morbidly obese, I am seriously overweight. I'm also 50% bald and I know that I'm not strictly-speaking handsome. But I don't think I'm hideous either. But I haven't matched with anyone (aside from bots/con-artist profiles) in years. So I feel as though I should give up on dating completely. Yet I just can't for some lame reason. It vexes the hell out me, because I ***really*** want to stop trying since nobody will give me a shot.  

My life feels pointless, yet I can't bring myself to end it all simply because I'm too afraid of the pain that comes with death along with the uncertainty tied to what comes next. I don't know who to turn to, or what to do. I exercise five days a week, yet can't lose weight to save my life. This is probably due to my severe obstructive sleep apnea causing my appetite to be abnormally high. I've tried the CPAP twice and that didn't work. And I don't qualify for the Inspire treatment, so I'm stuck trying to lose weight to cure my sleep apnea in an endless cycle/losing battle. And my health provider- Kaiser- is absolute garbage, so I have no help from them either in this regard. I know this isn't a health-based subreddit, but I just wanted to cite my efforts to work on myself. 

My entire weekly routine involves working, working out (walking for 45 to 65 minutes on a treadmill, five days a week), and playing the same MMORPG I've been playing for almost 15 years now. That and I see my mom one day a week and talk to her on the phone everyday. It's a mundane routine that is driving me nuts. I don't know how to branch out and try new things because I have severely crippling social anxiety and low-to-non-existent self-esteem. 

To make matters worse, I almost never have anything to do at work aside from browsing social media or gaming on my phone. I just feel frustrated. I apologize for how disjointed this rant is. I haven't been able to organize my thoughts properly for some time now. Any help/suggestions are appreciated. Cheers. ",8,1765306496.0,rant,24,0.9,False

As a first-timer American couple, I used reddit a good bit to get an idea of where to go and what to eat.  Hopefully me recounting my trip can help others on their journey.  Again, this is my first time so maybe I picked some weird or ""bad"" places, but that's all part of the fun of discovering new things, right?  We spent 10 days traveling around and just really enjoying ourselves.  I have some great photos I'll share at some point too.  Here's how it went:

# Day 1

We landed groggy, hungry, and excited.  Our hotel was Monsieur Aristide - a really nice place in a great location. Unfortunately, we landed early and were there at 8am...and check-in wasn't til 3pm.  So to kill time,  the first stop was Kozy Bosquet as recommended by the cool guy at the front desk. I had to try a croissant, and it didn't disappoint.  My first of many ""you just can't get this in Philly"" experiences... Also I had a great latte. Little did I know, it would be hard to find another large latte like this as the trip went on, but I digress.  Great atmosphere here and it was right by a little Christmas market.

Later after finally getting into our room and resting a bit,  we tucked into Le Vrai for a quick drink. My wife had a red wine, I had a beer, and the vibe was great.  Quiet and relaxed, which is sort of the overall Parisian vibe I'd say.

Dinner was at La Traversée, a spot I actually found from a reddit thread.  It felt very ""local"".  We had beef that was… let’s call it “philosophically cooked.” Essentially raw with chimichurri. Tasty for sure, but my wife liked it way more than I did.

Then we wandered to Amorino, where I experienced a religious event disguised as a crepe. The hot chocolate was OK, but the pistachio cream - good grief. Imagine pistachios deciding to become peanut butter to win a Michelin star.  I think this place was a chain, and maybe it was just me being an ignorant American, but I still think about that pistachio cream.

# Day 2

Brunch at Chez Marie came with slightly eerie “are we supposed to be the only people here?” vibes, but the onion soup was good. This is when I learned that my American lunch and dinner times did not mesh with Parisian times.  Didn't know anything about this place, but it was near my hotel.  It was ok, but felt a little cafeteria-ish.

After conquering the Arc de Triomphe and Eiffel Tower, we ate at Le Carré Elysée. Because of how close it was to the landmarks, it felt pretty touristy.  Lots of people speaking English here. My wife had beef bourguignon that made her super happy. I had a giant burger drenched—*drenched*—in cheese. It was pretty decent all things considered.

# Day 3

Brunch at Fric Frac was perfect little-corner-of-Paris comfort.  I think this was another one I got from Reddit.  A blonde beer for me, two croque madames for our lunch. Absolutely delicious.  Also, the dude working here was hustling.  He was running this place like an absolute legend. Waiting tables, hosting, taking payments, bussing.  He even dealt with an annoying American Karen who was complaining about ordering something incorrectly with grace.

Later, we stopped at Corcoran’s Irish Pub down by Moulin Rouge. This transported us directly to an American dive bar but without the sticky floor. Guinness for me, cocktail for my wife, then we dipped out. Not great, but a drink is a drink.

We met my wife's long-time French teacher at Brasserie Flores, a lively spot with a good crowd and lots of hanging flowers. It was so cool that we worked out meeting up with my wife's tutor.  Was great to hang out with a local for a bit. We were second-guessing if we should go to the Louvre or not, and her tutor said we must go.  We are here, so we must.

Dinner at Tentazioni near our hotel. They layout of this place was cool.  Sort of small, but good use of vertical space.  felt like dining inside a cozy bookmark. We both had lasagna that was pretty much “fine,” but the ambiance carried the night.

# Day 4

We trained to Colmar for a few days starting day 4.  I'll try to keep these next days lighter since I know this is a Paris sub, but I'll give the highlights.

Dinner was at Le Bateliers, which introduced us to Alsatian food with zero hesitation. My wife had pork knuckle the size of a medieval weapon. This seemed to be a staple on every menu here. I had spaetzle with munster that was creamy, salty, magical. The riverside setting was also really nice.

# Day 5

La Bonneterie became a top-tier brunch spot immediately. I had pancakes with eggs and bacon. Like...real bacon. Thick, tasty, filling bacon. My wife had shakshuka. My latte? The best of the entire trip. Staff: delightful. Owner: delightful.

Dinner almost didn’t happen because Colmar this time of year apparently books up like Beyoncé tickets. But our hotel worked some wizardry and got us into La Kilbe, a locals-vibe place outside the main drag.

We started with bone marrow which was a few sublime bites of rich, buttery joy. I had sauerkraut with five meats (each politely beige but tasty). My wife had Fleischschnacka, a spiraled meat-pasta hybrid that became one of the all-time winners of the trip. I am going to be craving this from now on, and have already started looking for recipes.  The food in this region reminded me of growing up in the coal region of PA as it felt very German inspired.

# Day 6

We returned to La Bonneterie, but this time for their secret weapon - the courtyard food truck. I got a stuffed pita with pulled pork and yogurt sauce so good I immediately got a second one like some kind of feral creature. Hot wine for us here as well to warm us up.

Dinner was at Wistub Brenner. It was hard to get into and crowded outside, but cozy once inside. My wife had salmon and this time I had the pork knuckle. My caramel apple pie was outrageous and my wife's Black Forest cake was something truly different in the best way.

# Day 7

We rented a car and roamed Alsace. Lunch at Au Dolder in Riquewihr came with a slightly icy waitress and a plate of cheeses that confirmed I am still very much a cheese beginner. My wife enjoyed her coq au vin, though.

We grazed on street food across towns, including a bretzel with munster that was shockingly great.

Dinner back in Colmar was at Zinc, where I had fresh linguine topped with chicken and veal in puff pastry smothered in brown sauce. It was rich, comforting, ridiculous and perfect. My wife couldn't resist and ordered Fleischschnacka again because she is correct.

# Day 8

Lunch at La Soï was pure joy. Yet another Reddit recommendation here.  My wife's was topped with munster and mine had spicy pimento and lardon. Both were divine and instantly entered the Hall of Fame. Pro tip - they don't let you split tarte flambee here. One per person.  Don't be scared, though.  I easily ate an entire tart.

Back to Paris that evening, where we ate at L’Hypothèse. My wife got a cod she didn’t love, but I thought was pretty tasty.

I, however, got another burger. And this burger was the best burger I’ve ever had. The bun? Ethereal. It's like it came out of the oven seconds before it was on my plate. The cheese sauce? So good that I had to stop my wife from stealing it off my plate.  The bacon? Paper thin and crispy like no other. I think about this burger every day since. My wife took one bite and looked like she had just unlocked 12% more of her brain. Seriously, I'd go back just for this burger.

# Day 9

Lunch at Jacobine: I had onion soup. My wife had a goat cheese salad that she crowned “best thing I ate.” High praise from a woman who ate Fleischschnacka twice.

Quick stop at Bar de la Croix Rouge, where my wife tried carpaccio and enjoyed it.

Dinner at Café Cassette, which was by far the prettiest restaurant of the trip. Warm, glowing, romantic. Definitely a cool place.  I had entrecôte with béarnaise and fries that made me genuinely emotional. My wife gave beef bourguignon another shot, but this one was dry and not her favorite. Dessert back at our hotel, L’Abbaye, rounded out the night with lemon meringue for my wife and coffee for me.

# Day 10

A Liberté croissant started the day strong before our Notre Dame tour.

Our farewell dinner was at Café Madame, and it delivered. I had pork sausage with cheesy mashed potatoes that tasted like a warm blanket. My wife had another goat cheese salad and loved it. A wonderful final meal, bookending the trip the way all great adventures should end—full, happy, and trying to ignore the reality of returning home.

Maybe I'll do a separate post about our full itinerary, but as first timers in Paris, the food really stood out.  But so did the people.  I must say, every single person was nice, kind, helpful, and friendly.  I am not a city guy at all, but I really loved my time in Paris and kinda can't wait to go back.",14,1765306073.0,ParisTravelGuide,3,0.94,False

I'm in Colorado, specifically in the Denver area, and my wife and I are going through a divorce after 12 years of marriage. We met back in college at CU Boulder, both studying business, and things started off great. We got married young, at 25, in a small ceremony at a park in Golden with just family and a few friends. We bought our first house in Aurora five years ago, a three-bedroom ranch style with a big backyard for the kids, but now it's feeling like a constant reminder of what went wrong.

The problems started building up slowly over the last few years. At first, it was little things, like arguing over who forgot to pay the water bill or why the garage was always cluttered with my tools and her craft supplies. But then it got bigger, money issues hit hard when I lost my job as a project manager at a tech firm during the layoffs in 2023, and we had to dip into savings to cover the mortgage, which is about $2,800 a month. She works as a nurse at a hospital in Denver, pulling 12-hour shifts three days a week, and I think the stress from that made her resent me for not contributing enough at home. We'd fight about chores, like who'd load the dishwasher after dinner or pick up the kids' toys scattered in the living room, simple stuff that turned into yelling matches in front of our two kids, a 7-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl.

One specific situation that sticks out was last summer when we planned a family trip to Rocky Mountain National Park. I packed the car with snacks, the kids' favorite blankets, and even our old tent from camping days, but halfway there, we got into a huge argument about directions because the GPS on my phone glitched, and she accused me of not planning properly. We ended up turning around and going home, and the kids were crying in the back seat the whole way. That was when I realized things weren't just tense; they were breaking us apart. There were also moments of emotional distance. She started spending more time with friends after work, coming home late without much explanation, and I found myself scrolling through my phone alone on the couch most nights, eating leftovers from the fridge like cold pizza or whatever was in the Tupperware.

Infidelity crept in too, though it's hard to admit. I discovered texts on her phone from a coworker about six months ago, nothing explicit but enough to make me question everything. We tried counseling for a couple of months at a place in Boulder, sitting in a small office with beige walls and a box of tissues on the table, but it felt forced. She'd say she wanted to work on it, but then we'd slip back into the same patterns, like ignoring each other during breakfast while the kids ate cereal at the kitchen table. Eventually, we decided separation was better, and now she's staying with her sister in Greenwood Village, about 20 minutes away, while I have the house. The kids split time between us, weekdays with me since my new job as a consultant lets me work from home, and weekends with her, but it's messy, with constant back-and-forth about who buys school supplies or handles doctor appointments.

Child custody is the part that's keeping me up at night. Our son has soccer practice twice a week at a field near our house, and our daughter just started kindergarten at the local elementary school in Aurora, where she has a routine with her backpack and lunchbox that I pack every morning with apple slices and peanut butter sandwiches. I worry about how a full divorce will affect their schedules, who gets holidays like Christmas, where we always decorate the tree with ornaments we've collected over the years, or birthdays, like our son's last one where we had a backyard party with a bounce house and cake from the grocery store. In Colorado, I know it's called ""allocation of parental responsibilities"" instead of just custody, focusing on parenting time and decision-making for things like education and health. We've been trying to agree on a plan, but disagreements pop up, like whether she can take the kids to visit her family in Pueblo for a week without my input, or how we split costs for braces if our daughter needs them soon, since her teeth are starting to crowd.

I've been researching options online, looking up things like child custody lawyers Colorado to find someone who can guide us without making it a big fight. I came across places that offer mediation and coaching, which sounds better than going to court, stuff like creating a detailed parenting plan that covers everything from daily routines to emergency decisions. One firm I talked to emphasizes fixed monthly costs so there are no surprise bills, and they have offices all over the state, from Golden to Fort Collins, which is convenient since we're in the metro area. They talked about helping with emotional support too, like dealing with the grief of ending the marriage, which I could use because some days I just sit in the empty house after the kids go to bed, staring at family photos on the wall from our trip to the zoo last year, feeling lost.

Asset division is another headache. We have the house with about $150,000 in equity, a joint checking account with maybe $5,000 left after bills, my 401(k) from the old job worth around $40,000, and her car that's paid off but mine has a loan of $10,000 still. Then there's smaller stuff like the living room furniture we bought together, a gray sectional couch that's worn from the kids jumping on it, and kitchen appliances, including the coffee maker I use every morning for my black coffee. We're trying to split things fairly under Colorado's equitable distribution laws, but it's tricky deciding who gets what without resentment building up again.

The whole process has been exhausting, from filing the initial paperwork at the courthouse in Denver, where I waited in line for an hour just to submit forms, to figuring out temporary child support based on our incomes, hers is steady at about $70,000 a year, mine's variable around $60,000 now. I've had to adjust little habits, like cooking simpler meals for the kids, such as spaghetti with ground turkey instead of beef to save money, or reading bedtime stories alone in their rooms decorated with posters of dinosaurs and princesses.

Has anyone here gone through a divorce in Colorado with kids involved and found a lawyer who really helped with the custody side without turning it into a battle? What tips do you have for making a parenting plan that actually works long-term?",1,1765305902.0,Divorce,1,1.0,False

1piff1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1piff1y/the_recital_at_bellmare_hall_part_35/,The Recital at Bellmare Hall (Part 3/5),"# Movement 3: Prelude

For a moment, I forgot where I was.

Time, place, identity, they all slipped. Like I’d dropped a thought mid-sentence and couldn’t find the beginning again.

When I came back to my senses, the air had changed.

It wasn’t thicker because of heat or humidity, but something heavier. Like I was standing underwater. My limbs felt slow. Sound came dulled. Even my own breath took effort, as if the air resisted me pulling it in.

I stood there, just outside Bellmare, unsure if I should take another step.

The dreams had rattled something deep in me, left behind a cold I couldn’t shake. Part of me wanted to get the hell out of dodge.

But something about the Hollow called to me. It was like a thread tugging at the center of my chest, winding through my ribs, pulling me forward. It wasn't exactly out of curiosity, but still, some part of me wanted to see what waited in the dark.

And beneath that pull, another tether held me tighter. Heavier. The piano. The single note that still echoed in my bones. The ghost of applause, wrapping around me like a chain. Whatever it was, whoever it was, I wouldn’t understand it just by running. I had to see it through. And the only place I’d find my answer was at the performance later that night.

I focused my vision again onto Dorset Hollow. Still there. Still silent. Still waiting. The streets remained empty as always. But now, now, I knew they weren’t abandoned. There was presence here. A pressure behind the eyes. A shift in the light.

Every so often, in the corner of my vision, I caught movement. Shadows that pulled away just before I could look at them.

There was nothing else to do but wander. The kind of wandering you do in dreams, where the destination doesn’t matter, just the walking.

I passed storefronts that might’ve once had purpose, but now only whispered the idea of life. A flower shop with brittle tulips in the window, their petals shriveled and gray. A tailor’s studio with empty hangers and no mannequins, just lengths of cloth draped like shrouds. Even the post office had its mail slots nailed shut, as if the town refused to receive anything from the outside world.

The Hollow wasn’t large, not in the way cities are measured. But it was deep, layered. Like a painting whose shadows pulled you inward, further into more. The streets twisted. Turned. Looped.

I kept walking.

Some of the houses I passed looked exactly like the ones before, but with just enough difference to make me doubt my memory. One had two windows instead of three. Another had a door handle that shifted sides. Every so often, I’d pass a porch I swore I’d seen moments earlier, but this time, the rocking chair was facing a different direction. Small things. Not big enough to prove, but just enough to disturb.

I tried leaving. Just to see if I could. Every road led back to itself. Every sign became circular.

There were no cars, no wind. No birds or rustling trees. Even my footsteps sounded distant, like they weren’t entirely mine.

Then, faintly, I caught a smell. Fresh bread. Warm and sweet, like it had just left the oven. It pulled me like a memory, straight to the bakery on the corner. The windows were fogged slightly, as if there was life inside, but the door was locked.

A handwritten sign hung in the glass:  
**“Recital Tonight — 7PM”**

Of course.

I kept walking. A few storefronts later, I passed a bookstore that I hadn’t noticed before, or maybe it hadn’t been there before. Dorset Hollow seemed to shift when I wasn't looking.

There was only one book in the window, laid on a pedestal.  
Blue cover. Silver ink.  
**“The Audience Remains.”**

I don’t know why I went in, but when I did, there was no bell. No creak of the hinges. Just a hush. A dense silence that folded around me like fog, soaking into my skin, my bones, my breath.

A woman sat at the counter. Clerk, maybe. Her back was to me, still as stone. She didn’t turn. Didn’t flinch. Didn’t even breathe, as far as I could tell.

I stepped in further. The bookshelves were tall and crooked, packed tight with strange tomes. The spines were unlabeled. Most of them were bound in a leather that didn’t feel right. Too dry, too smooth.

I pulled one free and opened it.

Blank pages.

Another: chaotic piano scores, like a child's scribbles.

Another: my name.

**LIAM GOODPRAY**

Written over and over, in identical script, line after line. Front to back. Hundreds of pages.

**LIAM GOODPRAY**

**LIAM GOODPRAY**

My chest tightened. I slammed the book shut. The sound echoed like thunder in the dead quiet.

Then I heard it. A hum. Low and steady. Three notes. Those same three notes from the dream. The woman still hadn’t moved, but she was humming.

Her voice didn’t waver. It was soft, but too constant., too clean. Like something pretending to be human.

I didn’t wait for her to turn around. I left. Fast. Didn’t close the door behind me. Didn’t look back. But as I stepped out onto the street again, I heard a page turn.

I went to the diner. It was quieter than yesterday though. The indoor lights were dimmed slightly and the red glow of the DIN(N)ER sign was noticeably faded. I walked in, if only for the sense of normalcy it would provide. That was naive of me.

The young man was sitting in his booth. He had the same flannel shirt and same thousand-yard stare. The same waitress stood with the same cherry-red lips.

I didn’t ask for any, but she poured me coffee.

“Sleep well, honey?” she asked.

“Not really.”

She didn’t say anything to that, but placed a napkin near my cup. Someone had drawn some music notes on it in pen. It was the same three notes from my dream.

“You know this song?” I asked.

“It knows you.”

I didn’t ask her to explain.

After drinking my coffee, the young man motioned to me and then pointed to some kind of bulletin board near the register. 

“I didn’t know you were famous,” he said.

I looked. It was a concert poster. In an elegant, silver-penned script at the bottom was the Bellmare Hall crest. But the person on it wasn’t me. It was Claire.

She was mid-performance, at that same piano from the hall. Her black hair was tucked behind one ear on her tilted head. The dress she was wearing was the same blue as the flash I had seen yesterday in the concert hall. Her expression was the same one she had when she got lost in the music. Poised. Serene. Beautiful.

But the date at the bottom of the poster, between the crest and the picture, read “March 3rd, 1953”.

“That’s not me,” I said, barely holding back tears.

The man simply looked at me and shrugged. “Sure looks like you buddy.”

I stared harder at the poster, and just for a second, I could see it. My hands on the keys, my face superimposed onto hers. But then it was gone. Just Claire again.

I blinked and some tears made their way through. “That’s not me. Just someone I knew. Someone who’s gone.”

He looked at me again, with no emotion behind it except maybe tiredness. “Lots of folks think they recognize someone in these old posters. Faces change, blurs overlap.""

He turned his tired eyes up to me. ""But she’s always there, the lady in the blue dress. Always seated in the front row, always smiling like they’re playing a song that she composed.”

I stepped forward and and leaned in closer until my eyes were inches from the poster. More details emerged...details that shouldn’t have been there. A necklace I gave her on our third anniversary, a scar on her hand from that time she broke a plate.

“This can’t be real. She’s never been here. She wasn’t even alive in the fifties.”

“Time’s funny in this town, especially around Bellmare,” the man said, looking at his coffee. “Sometimes it doesn’t flow. Sometimes it sits still, waiting.”

“For what”

He took a sip of coffee. “You.”

I stepped out of the diner, my heart pounding in my chest like a wild animal in a cage, and my hands squeezed so tight it felt like I was holding glass. I didn’t know where I was going, but I just had to walk. 

A poster from 1953. With Claire on it. This had to be some twisted joke. A prank that the whole town was in on. But I couldn’t explain the necklace or the scar, or how her face almost became mine for a second. 

I kept walking. Right by the empty stores. Right by the hollow houses. Shadows followed me in the windows like angels of death. They were gone once I looked at them. And the sun seemed to be setting, but only in the spots where I stood. Maybe I was going crazy.

I just kept walking. But then I noticed it, past the hollow buildings and shaded windows. A small church, rooted in ivy and fog. Its white steeple pointed heavenward. The door hung open, inviting me in. The sign out front was faded, but I still made out the lettering:

""Saint Cecilia’s—Est. 1897""

Beneath it, scratched into the wood:

*“Sing unto Him, ye who mourn”*

Through the glass, I saw a figure. A red-headed woman was seated in a dim glow, playing  a violin. I heard no sound. Her fingers traced melodies I couldn’t hear, but somehow felt in the depths of my being. Sorrow. Her figure blurred, and then vanished into the shadows.

I stepped inside. The temperature dropped immediately. It wasn’t just cool, it was freezing, like an arctic crypt. I could even see my breath. The air smelled like damp wood and it had a sharp, metallic undertone that I couldn’t make out. The interior was dimly lit, but it was still intact. Untouched by time. Pews were lined up like a tightly-knit army and a simple altar stood at the opposite end of the door. A modest piano sat to the side of it, much different than the one in Bellmare. This one didn’t seem to be calling me to play. 

On the walls were stained-glass windows, but the colors seemed too dark. I thought it was just dust, but then I noticed that there was no sunlight behind the glass, despite the fact that it was the afternoon. It was more like they reflected the glow of a dying blaze: strong, impactful, but otherwise ending.

I moved further in. The floor creaked sadly beneath my feet, as if it was mourning itself. On top of the pews, candles were lit, leaking wax down the wood. They left fresh impressions upon the cushions. There wasn’t a soul in sight, and I saw the hymnal. It laid upon the altar, pages yellowed and stained. One stood out. Fresh ink was written on it, blacker than black. It read:

“Requiem for the Empty: For the grieving and the chosen”

Beneath that title was a list of names. A couple dozen perhaps. They didn’t mean anything to me, after all, they were just names. But then I noticed the dates beside them. They ranged from the early 1900s all the way up to 2018. Each had a title.

“Harold Carr (1902): Died during performance”

“Benjamin Mandol (1907): Checked in, hasn’t checked out”

“Jonathan Bale (1912): Playing still”

And right there at the very end:

“Claire Halden (2018): Admitted. Not recovered”

I stared in shock. This couldn’t be the same Claire. My Claire. Halden is her last name, but this was impossible. Then I noticed something off about the page. It was strangely warm. I turned around without even thinking. Nothing behind me but the dripping wax. But then I saw the floor.

The impressions of bare footprints on the dust led from the altar to some corner in the back near the confessionals. I followed. The door of the booth was open, just a bit. I didn’t step in. I couldn’t. Not when I saw what was scratched onto the inside of the door:

*“It’s not her. Not really”*

Then from behind me, from where the piano lay. Three notes. 

That was enough. I left quickly. Not running though, I didn’t want to feel like prey. But every step had more effort put into it than the last. I eventually had to force myself to go further, as it felt like something behind me was commanding me to stay. I didn’t look back, not even once.

Back in town, the sky had dimmed. It wasn’t sunset yet, but the light was dying. Shadows stretch farther than they should have been able to. A nearby clock read 4:22 p.m, but I didn't think time was behaving correctly anymore. I passed the town square and noticed a statue. It wasn’t a war memorial or a founder’s statue or anything. It was a man seated at a piano. His arms stretched and bent wrong, fingers melted into the keys. No name or plaque adorned it, but wrapped around his throat like a noose was a blue scarf, and a lavender bouquet laid at his feet. I continued onward.

I made it back to the hall just after 5:00 p.m. The doors were already open, beckoning to me. Inside, the chandeliers were lit, and the air held a hush like an auditorium right before a conductor lifts their baton. Wellers stood waiting in the lobby, same suit, same smile. 

“You’ve seen her, haven’t you?” he asked.

“I’ve seen…something,” I replied.

“Mr. Wellers finds that it often helps to look,” he said, hands folded. “But not too long. Reflection is a doorway, Mr. Goodpray. But some doors, once opened, don’t shut.”

I stared at him. “You speak like a preacher. Or maybe like…something else is speaking for you.”

His lips curled ever so slightly, into something that somewhat resembled a smirk. “Wellers is but a humble mouthpiece,” he replied. He then paused, tilted his head, and stared right through my soul.

And then, in a voice different to his own, “But the tune is me.”

I backed away, but he didn’t move, didn’t follow. He just bowed his head.

“You should prepare,” he said, his voice returned back to that soft Louisiana tone. “The performance begins at seven sharp.”

I turned toward the exit, toward the parking lot. Toward escape. Toward normalcy. My instincts reached for the car, but my soul had other ideas.

My legs moved on their own, and after a moment, my mind gave up trying to argue. Instead of asphalt, I found stairs under my feet. I climbed back toward my room, slow, like wading into a dream I already knew the end of. The hallway felt longer this time. Or maybe I was smaller. The light bent differently now, and the carpet didn’t make a sound.

The door to my room was open even though I distinctly remember closing it. Inside, a suit was laid on the bed. Black cashmere and silk, cleanly pressed, spotless. Under the amber lights, it shimmered like the night sky. Beside it lay a single lavender and a slip of paper. I picked it up. In the same damn handwriting as the letter that started this whole mess, it read:

*“Bellmare Presents: One Night Only*

*Liam Goodpray, Pianist*

*Those who play, remain”*

Outside, I heard the wind whisk its way through the branches, like whispering voices. And beneath it, music. It wasn’t a melody I knew, but one I could understand. It had a purpose. Shape. But then, it exploded from everywhere. The bed, the desk, the walls, even the windows. I leaned closer to one, drawn in like a sailor to a siren. A reflection began to form in the glass.

Claire. In that blue dress, sitting in the front row of the concert hall, just as the young man said. Through the reflection, her eyes met mine. She was smiling. And then, a nod.

A part of me believed that it was her who played that note I heard outside Bellmare. That faint, aching D-minor echo. And then, something inside me clicked.

If I stayed, if I played, maybe the performance would finish what had been left undone. Maybe the music would bridge the impossible. And maybe… just maybe… I could see her again. Not in my dreams. Not in my memories.

But really see her. Be with her.

The clock on the wall struck 6:55.

I reached for the suit.

Now I understand their mistakes. The choices that didn't make sense. The times they seemed overwhelmed or angry or distant. They weren't withholding wisdom they genuinely didn't have it.

But understanding that also left me unmoored. If they didn't know what they were doing who does? Where's the authority I was waiting to become?

Also I’ve a sore throat this week. 

So today I had an appointment in Beaumont Hospital at around 4pm , and had to get my bloods done a few hours before. So I was done with my bloods at about 12pm, so instead of driving home which would be about an hour to where I live, why not kill some time. I have exams later this week and I had my iPad, pencil, powerbank and headphones on me, so I’ll get a bit of study done before my appointment. 

Obviously not in the hospital now, so I drove down the road to Beaumont house - my first time being there. It’s Tuesday so it’s quiet. I enter the lounge and I order a coffee, I get my coffee, pay and sit down in the corner of the lounge out of sight. In this specific corner there’s about 5 tables, I’m sitting on one and there are other people sitting across from me at another. Plenty of room for more customer in that area and also in other areas of the lounge - it’s Tuesday. 

It’s about 12:30 when I sit down so I’m studying and enjoying my coffee. About an hour in, I finish, bring my cup up to the bar and ask for another. The barman (who was sound) says he’ll drop it down to me. I receive my second drink, and pay, this time I’m served by a young lady, who was also very nice. This is like 2 hours gone by now. Again, it’s not busy at all, and there are plenty of seats in the lounge. 

After I finish that, the lady passes by and I ask for for a cup of hot water with a spoon (for the pack of lemsip I have on me). She gives it to me and doesn’t charge me(I wouldn’t charge a customer for a cup of  hot water either where I work, neither is it on the till). I drink my lemsip and another hour maybe goes by. Again, loads of seats. To me that would be the same as asking for water and then taking a panadol tablet. 

The Manager comes by, he’s about 6ft2, early 60s, white hair and big mustache, picks up the lemsip wrapper and says “you can’t bring in your own lemsip and use our water, we’ll have to charge you for that”. When he’s speaking he’s going red and is uneasy, he looks a mixture of furious and agitated. I had my headphones on and I the study session was super productive, so I wasn’t really bothered by it. Also cost of living so maybe I should’ve have been charged 😂. They charge my 3.50 for a cup of hot water, and ring it through as tea. Again not that I’m fussed about 3.50 but technically I’m being overcharged but hey, I’m not a fan of Karens so I wasn’t about to turn into one. But I had a feeling he would give out again. 

The manager is now pacing up and down, the lounge, I’m drinking my lemsip and he tells me that I I need to finish up and leave. I’ve been there just under 2.5 hours. I’m a bit confused if I watched both champions league matches in the bar that day, I’d be there almost 4 hours for example. I take off my headphones and try have a conversation with him but he just storms off. I tell him I’ve paid for my drinks and there’s loads of free seats but he’s not having any of it. I hate jumping to the racism conclusion but I really do think he was intimidated by my appearance. So I went through a process of elimination: 
My clothes: I was wearing Jeans and a longsleeve top, no tracksuits or anything. 
My hair: I’ve a low cut. 
Did I make a mess on the table or was I loud: No quite the opposite. 

So I thought maybe he was having a bad day and just continued, cause I couldn’t be arsed finding somewhere else an hour before my appointment. He comes up to make again a few minutes later takes my empty cup away and says “this is not an office space, You need to leave you’ve been here too long.” At this point he clearly has an issue with me. So I just tell him straight up that I don’t have an issue with him and that why does he have an issue with me. FYI, In the 3 bars/gastropubs I’ve worked in, we always allow paying customers to stay as long as their drinking and we’re not waiting on a table, and we allow them to do crosswords, do their books, read books/paper that’s no issue. He’s not ready to talk.

Up until this point I was very respectful, I believe in respecting any strangers especially older people. But I had had enough at this point. So I come back up to the bar to get another coffee as , not that I wanted one but maybe I hadn’t spent enough and I was wrong. As I’m waiting he asks me what I want and I said I was having a think (now I’m being smug and cheeky). He says “you can think but we’ll see if anyone will serve you”. Wow. I asked the barman behind him for a coffee, it was dropped to my table and I paid. Again no issue with the other staff.  

I drink half of it and continue studying. Again he comes back and says “this is not an office space” since I’m being cheeky now I reply back and say that I’m not doing office work. He replies and says I can’t use a computer in here and I say I’m not using a computer because I was using my iPad. Again we’re going back and forth, not loud though. I ask if he’s the manager then he gets a phone call and walks away and says “look I’m busy”. He comes back to talk to me again and I say tell him as the manager, doesn’t he have anything better to do? This is his 4th or 5th time coming up to me and there are other customers in the establishment. 

Now he’s rattled and raises his voice to say “how dare you tell me what to do” and storms off. He comes up and tells me that again and that I need to leave. I told him that he should call the guards to remove me, as he didn’t have a decent reason to explain to the guards. Btw I didn’t see a sign saying management had a right tor refusal but maybe there was. 

I put my headphones back on and try and finish and I hear him say to a customer that they should put a sign up saying no more office space. Again I’m not that bothered. He’s pacing up and down and comes up to me once more saying that I’m here too long but again I’m not going to leave for no valid reason. 10 minutes later (it’s now 10 minutes to 4) or so I finish my work and drop my coffee up to the bar. He’s standing there, steam almost coming out of his ears, and I say to him I don’t have a problem with him. He cuts in again and says “I don’t care” with his arms folded like a child. I tell him that all his staff are lovely but as the manager he was the only one who was rude, annoying and obnoxious. 

Again he says he doesn’t care. So I ask him if he’s in tomorrow , with which he replies it’s none of my business.  Then I say thank you and that I’ll see him again tomorrow and leave. Again, I did push back and was cheeky with him. And maybe I’m in the wrong. Just wanted to know if anyone else has had similar issues with that Manager, as I hate to put things down to racism. Sorry for the long winded story. 



Edit: thanks for all the responses I, definitely wasn’t targeted. I also had a wrap from the mace across the road before I came in, and I don’t drink(health and all) which is why I didn’t get a pint or food. ",29,1765305707.0,Dublin,49,0.72,False

They keep pushing the limit of what we’re willing to allow. The raises in rewards points, the raises in prices or the shrinkage of their products, etc. It’s an insult that a drink costing one dollar more is being placed in a position above a breakfast sandwich equal in cost. 

We need to bring boycotting back, otherwise corporations like this will continue to push the boundary of what we allow. They don’t exist without our money and our support and the louder we speak, the more support they lose, the more they’re willing to listen and be reasonable with their business practices. 

I believe it’s necessary to take this approach not only in matters like this, but every aspect of life. 
Whether it’s matters such as policy, business, and community, people need to wake up and realize their voice.

It might seem trivial that this post is regarding boycotting coffee, but I’m sure a lot of people are tired of having every single business (not just dunkin) siphoning away the small joys we have. 

Believe me, big businesses can spare something as simple as rewards points (that they’re already getting from our business) to put towards something as trivial as a “free cold brew coffee” or “breakfast” item. 

I implore for any of you to do the math of what it used to cost and what it now costs and question whether you believe they even respect you as a customer. This is coming from an individual with a masters of business and knows the value of a customers dollar. 

You matter, and your business with these corporations matter. Don’t think otherwise.

P.S. Yes, I take everything seriously (even as simple as a coffee) as an active member of the community that doesn’t stand for any bullying coming from “powerful” or “rich” individuals. This isn’t the first time I make this stance on business, politics, or other matters and it won’t be the last time. 

They (not just Dunkin’) don’t want you to know you have a voice, because then they can keep taking advantage of you and your business. Just a reminder.

I was shocked - I didn't realize just how good cow's milk was for this compared to the alternative barista milks.

The problem is that I just *really* dislike the taste of real milk in my coffee. It's just a sour/acidic/tangy flavor I don't like (not expired btw), whereas oat complements the coffee flavor so well - it just doesn't have a texture anywhere near as easy to pour nor the silky mouthfeel.

I kept forgetting to log small impulse purchases — coffee, snacks, delivery — 
and by the end of the month I had no idea where my money actually went.

The biggest problem for me was the speed of tracking:
• I had to enter the current price manually every time  
• I had to type the name of the expense  
• choose an icon, a category, etc.

Doing all that while standing in a shop queue is impossible, so I kept telling myself:
“I'll add it later at home”… and of course I never did :)

So I built a tiny app called TapBudget.

The idea is simple: you log frequent purchases in one tap using preset categories.
It takes 2 seconds, so I finally stopped forgetting.

I also wanted to understand spending trends without needing precise numbers every time,
so I added optional price ranges for categories. It helped me notice which “small” expenses
were adding up the most.

I made it for myself first, but now it’s on the App Store.

Things I like about this: 

1) it has a similar silhouette to what I already wear. I tend to wear fitted tops and skirts that flare out at the waist. However, most of my clothing items are above the knee, so I can't wear them to work.

**What I'm looking for:**

We're both Adjusters. Maybe your character still believes that we're helping people. Maybe mine's starting to crack. Maybe we both are and we're just cracking in different directions. I want the moral complexity, the horror of realising you're the bad guy in someone else's story. 

**Novella literate:** I write 500-800+ words per reply (if I'm being honest often more), sometimes more when the scene's got its hooks in me. Multiple paragraphs, and I like detail to a point that I know a lot of people don’t. The internal monologue, the environmental details, the way a character's picking at their thumbnail while they're lying, all of it. I'm not asking you to match that word-for-word, but I need a partner who won't see a long post and think ""oh god"" instead of ""oh good."" 

**Long term worldbuilding** that we develop together because I want a partner in this. What's the company's real endgame? How far does the network spread? What happens to a person after they've been adjusted a hundred times? A thousand?

**Slow burn relationships** (romantic, platonic, antagonistic, I genuinely don't care as long as it earns itself). Characters with complications and contradictions. People who don't have easy answers because easy answers are for people who haven't looked in the mirror lately.

**I'm 21+,** you should be too. This is going into dark psychological places - surveillance, loss of autonomy, the death of self. **Third person past tense** is my preference and how I’ll write (I wrote the above just for the vibe) but I'm flexible for how you want to write. Expect a few solid replies a week. 

**I’m open to discussing the platform**. It needs to have a web-based option because I do all my writing on a standard keyboard, not on my phone. 

If you don’t mind, in **your first message**: Tell me about the moment your character realises things might be messed up. The specific assignment, the thing they see, the moment where all the little weird things snap into focus and they start to question what they're really part of. Not in some vague ""oh no the system is bad"" way, I want the specific thing, the detail that hits them.",1,1765305367.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

to recap this reading: i came up with this four-position spread while having my evening chat with Lucifer, as it hit me that we’re literally less than a month away from 2026. if you’re feeling overwhelmed trying to process this year (especially if you had a tower moment, or several) this spread is meant to help you integrate the journey so far and move forward with renewed inner strength.

it’s luciferian-inspired, so themes around shadows, truth-seeking, and self-acceptance may show up. if that feels right, then this one is definitely for you 🖤 (you don’t need to work with him to benefit from the reading, don’t worry)

this year-integration spread includes:

💜 the integration: contradicting or polarizing truths you learned this year that you’ll need to hold together with compassion rather than “fix.”

💜 the harvest: the gifts, growth, and character-development arcs you’ve already earned.

💜 the light-bringer: the spark, calling, or passion awakening for 2026 (can be totally unexpected)

💜 the release: the dead weight, exhaustion, expectations, or outdated versions of yourself (or others) that are falling away for good.

🌸 **paid readings**

i pull as many cards as I need for each position and provide pics.

DM me if you'd like one. i just need your initials and your rising/moon (optional, it makes the reading more precise).

you can share as much or as little context as you want. if you want me to focus the spread on a specific area of your life, just let me know!

🌸 **free readings (1 spot, delivered on thursday, thank you for your patience!)**

i’ll choose one person from the comments for a free version of this spread (one card per position).

comment:

✨ your favorite tarot card and why (can be as long or as short as you want) 💗

i’ll DM you to request the same basic info as the paid readings.

i’m doing this spread all december, so if you don’t get picked this time, you’ll have other chances!

optional energy exchange is a review if the message resonates, or even a reading exchange if you also read tarot! it doesn't matter if you are a beginner, we all start somewhere 🩷

🗣️ please only DM me for paid readings!! 🗣️

I just ran out of oat milk, and decided it couldn't hurt to use some whole milk for a cappuccino... and had the best pour I've ever had. The milk was a genuinely silky texture, the stream actually followed the pitcher and made ripples easily and right where I wanted. I was shocked - I didn't realize just how good cow's milk was for this compared to the alternative barista milks.

The problem is that I just *really* dislike the taste of real milk in my coffee. It's just a sour/acidic/tangy flavor I don't like (not expired btw), whereas oat complements the coffee flavor so well - it just doesn't have a texture anywhere near as easy to pour nor the silky mouthfeel.

We were going to the airport and flying down to Oklahoma City. We were standing in the security line, myself in front. 

I went through the security line and detector just fine. I went ahead grabbed my luggage, get my shoes back on, and grabbed a coffee next door. I assumed after all this he'd be right behind me.

Once I get settled I start looking for him. Nowhere to be seen. I check the security line thinking there was a hold up. Nothing. I try calling him, straight to voicemail.

I have no idea where he went. I was a young guy at the time and this guy was mid 50s. Not my supervisor, but pretty much took point on the trip and I had no idea what I was going to do if he didn't come.

I was waiting at the gate and we were getting close to boarding. He called me then and had me tell the attendant that he was on his way. 

So, what happened was he left something in his bag. Usually he drives to visit our company's locations since we're all in the Midwest. He didn't think about it and used the same bag for flying.

Well, TSA found a bullet in his bag. Just one. No gun, nothing. Just a bullet with a name carved into it. They took him to a secure area and questioned him for a long time. He somehow talked them into giving the bullet back to him so he could go back to his truck and put it in there. 

SO he says, the bullet was his father's and his father had carved the name of the man who his wife had an affair with. His father passed on and when he was cleaning the house he found the bullet. He has kept it with him ever since.",6,1765305170.0,PeakyBlinders,0,0.88,False

Wedding is in a few weeks nalang, and stressing na sa mga bagay bagay like this one. Need all your tips and opinions on how our cocktail hour is shaping up to be. Feel ko kasi Baka kailanganin pa ng more activities??? 

Expected guests: 160-170pax
Cocktail Hour venue: Garden

Cocktail Hour 3pm

Food and Drinks
 - coffee cart (150pax allocation)
 - potato corner (180pax allocation)
- Lil orbits (150pax allocation)
- 100 bottles of beer + 100 glasses of sangria
- 3 kinds of Starters will already be served by the caterer

Activities
- on-site portrait studio
- roving photoman
- music from jazz band

Reception Hall is open by 5pm already, so total of 2 hours lang talaga the cocktail hour. Now I’m overthinking if the activities during our cocktail hour is too thin? Food and drinks parang secure nako na enough na yan, but like napapaisip ako if may need pang add na ganap para hindi lang ma-bore mga tao.

Kaya lang, ayoko talaga ng parang random booths na Hindi naman namin hilig as a couple. Ung bet ko talaga sana na nice is to leave board games, or card games in common areas. Biglang H2B is a board game enthusiast. Tapos ako more on fitness and kpop, so parang wala naman akong mailalagay dun na related booth. 🤣

Granted, ung anxiety came from unsolicited advice from mostly senior citizens, and it’s not like they’re the majority of the guests. Pero syempre, na trigger pa rin Ang wedding planning thoughts ko tuloy. 

Any recommendations on possible activities we can add? Or if from experience nyo rin, Keri na naman rin yan?

There’s an insane amount of variation in how mental health experts, docs, etc talk about being trans, and I don’t feel confident outsourcing this to someone else.

I’d really love to get a sense of what other things parents are reading and discussing, and how they’re making sure their kids stay informed on everything (including the news).

How much time do you spend talking w your teen kids around gender? Have you gone through a gender course (ie coursera), philosophy books, or lit discussions (ie gender bending in Shakespeare)? Is it worth reading Reddit together to discuss different perspectives / experiences in the trans community? Do you talk politics at all or avoid it entirely? 

Most importantly, are there ways to make these discussions less awkward - like doing them over coffee or by text? Tbh it’s as painful as talking to my kiddo about junior year and college planning 😭

1pif445,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pif445/aita_for_not_wanting_to_split_the_bill_equally/,AITA for not wanting to split the bill equally when I barely eat anything due to my weight loss journey?,"I’m currently on a weight-loss journey, so whenever I go out with my friends, I usually eat much less than everyone else. For example, the last time we went out, I only had a salad, a bowl of chicken soup, and a cold coffee—my total came to around ₹450 (~$5.01). Everyone else ordered full meals, starters, desserts, and multiple drinks.

The total bill came to ₹4,500 (~$50.06), and when it was time to pay, everyone decided to split it equally. That meant I had to pay ₹1,125 (~$12.52), even though I barely ate compared to the rest.

I lightly hinted that maybe we could just pay for what we ordered, but they laughed it off and said that not everyone eats the same amount. For example, X ordered an extra LIIT drink, but no one was asking X to pay separately for that either. They said all of this in a non-offensive way, clearly implying that equal splitting should be the norm, regardless of how much each person consumed. I didn’t push it further because I didn’t want to make things awkward.

I do realize that I can be careful with money at times, but that’s because my monthly budget is very low.

It feels unfair to keep paying the same amount when I clearly consume much less, especially when I’m already being mindful of both my health and my finances.

After this incident, I spoke about it with my roommate (who was not part of that group). I also told her that I’m thinking of not hanging out with that group anymore, but that would basically mean cutting them off completely, since all their plans revolve around brunch or dinner. My roommate said that if she were in my place, she would have just paid her half without making it an issue — and that response made me feel like maybe I am being an asshole.

1pif0gt,https://i.redd.it/nue5ked7186g1.jpeg,My first year of Hyatt: 31 properties in 9 countries (with imgur links),"TLDR: there isn’t one. I spent one night at 31 different properties on my way before and after Globalist, and I ramble about my experiences, rather than trying to use a ranking system, below (at least you know it’s not AI?!). I liked all the stays for different reasons, but I’m happy with my international focus as I continue to have great experiences and value there (London, Doha, Bangkok, Tokyo, Kyoto, Macau, Zhuhai, Hong Kong, Sydney). I apologize in advance for any formatting issues that I can’t change later.
 
**My 2025 in Hyatt-** I found that the silver lining of outrageous dental bills this past year was embracing award travel and the YOHHSO lifestyle- “you only have hotel status once.” I had maybe two Hyatt nights last year, but this year am ending on 73 through a mix of travel, mattress runs, and credit card nights. My stays were chosen for a mix of convenience (airport shuttle, walking distance to things), low budget (almost all of this was on points, though only some were planned around the actual points calendar), high value (where can I stay to maximize benefits while I have status), and brand explorer check boxes (just hit 15, can get 5 more reasonably but that will probably be it for me). Most of my stays are alone so the bed type and room size doesn’t matter, I value views (water especially) over most everything, I walk everywhere and prefer to minimize rideshare needs (only needed parking twice), and with two exceptions have never paid for a meal at a property. I also change hotels every night on purpose so I can experience as many as possible- I **love** hotels. None of these stays were for work, though I worked remotely from most of these (though my bandwidth needs were minimal).
 
**Hyatt Place/Hyatt House-** while I love the stays I’ve had in higher end properties, with higher end benefits, I will always appreciate the value and reliability of an airport HP/HH. I have definitely had differences in room and breakfast quality among the different stays, even within the same properties that I have visited multiple times, but I have never regretted nor had a bad stay at any one of these: My only frustration is that many of the older properties don’t have enough USB ports, though that’s also on me for never traveling with the block.
 
**HP Heathrow-** room was small and dark but I was only there overnight and didn’t need anything else. It was clean and quiet, though the lobby bar was bustling more than I expected in the evening. The city bus to/from the terminal is very close and was quick and reliable.
 
**HP BWI-** nothing super special, but always is quiet and has friendly staff. I have had the biggest range in room style here- I think they must be working their way through renovations.
 
**HP Herndon/Dulles Airport-East-** always busy, no matter when I checked in (usually later in evening). The shuttle can fill up so get on the list as soon as you can if you need a spot at a certain time. Also a short walk to the metro.
 
**HP Boston/Braintree-** not an airport hotel but is within walking distance of the Logan Express Braintree stop. There is a small plaza attached with a few dining options, and a bit farther to walk to a mall. Parking was free and plentiful and easy.
 
**HP and HH MCO-** these were interchangeable for me except for the shuttle schedule- the HH has a 24 hour shuttle, while the HP stops running for a few hours in the middle of the night. The HH also has a full kitchen setup and I think is newer, though I had a very new-looking room at the HP. Shout out to the HR MCO where I stayed last year after an evening flight cancelation- impossible to beat the *in terminal* airport location, but not practical for my budget to do regularly.
 
**HP Orlando/Lake Buena Vista-** to me this is walking distance to Disney Springs, which has all the free park and hotel shuttles and the city bus to/from the airport for $2, but if you don’t want to go that far there are still other dining options closer (and probably a hotel park shuttle that I just haven’t used). I have had varying degrees of breakfast success, but overall it’s just not good- maybe if you show up right at open you’ll have better luck.
 
**HP ATL North-** indistinguishable from the rest in that I can barely remember it! The shuttle was easy and I walked to a McDonalds for food.
 
**HP Atlanta Cobb Galleria-** nothing super special, but doesn’t need to be. The location was right for my event and the city bus was cheap and easy to/from MARTA. There are lots of fast casual dining options to walk to.
 
**Everything else:**
 
**Great Scotland Yard (Unbound)** (February) https://imgur.com/a/great-scotland-yard-t4uI0qJ
I love this hotel! I picked it because of the location and how unique and quirky it looked- I didn’t want to be in a hotel in London that could have been in any random US city. Instantly it lived up to the pictures and description- the lobby and hallway art and history was super interesting. The room had character too, and not the bad kind, though it was on the smaller side (as I had read about). I had also read that upgrades are tougher there because of the room types and sizes, and I was traveling with my mom so we definitely wanted two beds. I used a a GOH and it may have bumped us up to a differently-named category, but it wasn’t noticeable and we really didn’t need any more space (nor are there any significant views to be had). We enjoyed the breakfast but didn’t need the late checkout. If I were limited in my GOH uses I would probably not apply it in the future, since now I know it can be more valuable in other properties. I feel very lucky to have been gifted two though and they inspired me to go for my own status.
 
**Park Hyatt London River Thames** (February)- https://imgur.com/a/park-hyatt-river-thames-b0M34gL
I used a second GOH here, and boy did we enjoy it! This was the last day of our trip and I planned it to be more relaxing in order to enjoy the property more. It was within walking distance to a museum my mom wanted to see, and I had a great run around, and visit to, the Battersea Power Station. No, the location isn’t central, but we found it perfect for our plans. What really stuck out was the view- we were upgraded to a river view room on a high floor, and it was so stunning that we were so happy to have time just to sit in the room and look out the window. The hotel also went above and beyond for us (though maybe this is normal as a PH- it was my first stay at that level). The customer service from the front desk was wonderful (though my mom wouldn’t stop raving to them about how much she loved Scotland Yard 🤦‍♀️), and they set up a cake, balloons, and wine in our room because I had told them we were celebrating my mom’s birthday. Breakfast was delicious and I swam in the lovely pool before we left. It really was a wonderful stay and I would recommend it to anyone, though especially so if you can get a river view room and have some time to enjoy the amenities.
 
**The Lodge at Spruce Peak (Destination by Hyatt)** (March)- https://imgur.com/a/lodge-spruce-peak-PQ0DMAh
I stayed here with my annual Amex FHR credit and got my Hyatt night and milestone with no problem. Parking was paid only- told nothing free available even though it says maybe on the website. It was a bit of a risk at the end of the season, as one of my goals was to get a friend introduced to cross country skiing, and technically it backfired as we had warm rain for the two days and every winter thing was closed (though in typical Vermont fashion it blizzarded a few weeks later of course!). We still had a great stay though, and were upgraded to the category of room that had a full kitchen (in a hallway space) and a fireplace (obsessed, I want one). We didn’t have a view but that was ok. With no skiing available we had signed up for the snow shoe hike (there is a published activity schedule, and one or two things are included in the resort fee), but that was canceled because of the weather. The guide refunded us and instead we did it as a short hike just to be outside, and that was fun. We also went to the pool and hot tub, and used the FHR credits to get food at the market and takeout from the restaurant. The food, especially the market, seemed verrrry overpriced, but that is not unexpected at a ski resort. If I had stayed longer I would have brought my own food and used the room’s kitchen. It was not very busy because of the time of year and a lot of the shops/activities were closed or on reduced hours because of the season change (I think later was a transition to warm weather activities), but I can see how it would be quite lively and a great location in the middle of the season if you are a skier (and more expensive!).

My mom and I went to NYC for a night to see a show, and this location was right and seemed like a good point value for us (and a brand explorer check). We had a great time and loved the hotel. I had read about the elevator delays (only one open due to construction), but we planned around it and budgeted an extra ten minutes on either end and didn’t get upset if it took that long. We were upgraded to a room that had Empire State Building views from our beds, which was fun when it was lit up at night. We were given drink tokens at check in but didn’t use them. The rooftop bar was closed but the area was open to sit, and we brought food up there to eat and had a lovely view. I would happily stay here again.
 
**Andaz Doha** (May, first stay as Explorist)- https://imgur.com/a/andaz-doha-K79oAka
I didn’t spend much time here, as I had an all-day tour planned, but it was definitely a nice property and I enjoyed the views from my ocean view room (upgraded from the standard award). I also had a delicious welcome snack waiting for me. I didn’t use the pool but went to see it, and I spent the evening walking along the promenade from the hotel. Overall I enjoyed the stay and the location, though I didn’t feel like I had missed out on anything by not being around the hotel much. The lobby art, and décor in general, was unique and beautiful. I would stay here again if I was planning on being busy touristing most of the time, and it was a great point value for that.
 
**Grand Hyatt Erawan Bangkok** (May)- https://imgur.com/a/grand-hyatt-erawan-bangkok-DVgQNbJ
I’m not totally sure if I was upgraded here- I had a corner room so I think so- but it was another stay where I was out of the hotel most of the time. The location is fantastic, and I had a nice time sitting by the pool and not-quite-hot tub after an early run in the park nearby. The lobby, and street outside, are busy but would never know that from the quiet pool area, and I didn’t have any noise bother me at any point anywhere. I wished I had time to take a bath- it was a huge tub!
 
**Hyatt House Shibuya** (June)- https://imgur.com/a/hyatt-house-shibuya-PuGE1LB
This was a hard reservation to get! Though it was after the points increase I felt lucky to get a room, and the in-room laundry machine was worth all of the difficulty alone. This was halfway through a three week trip and the night after a red eye flight, so it was especially lovely to throw everything in the wash and go to bed in the hotel’s clean pajamas. I also used the dryer the next morning because I needed to pack my running clothes after a rainy run, so that was another huge benefit. Definitely read the instructions on the QR code carefully though, as it’s not an intuitive machine! The hotel provided one detergent packet (liquid), but you may have been able to request more/get it restocked from housekeeping on a longer stay. Otherwise I didn’t have much time in the hotel, which was by design- it was the neighborhood I was there to see. I have mixed feelings about the location of the hotel- I found it very easy to find getting in and out of the train station, as the hotel has put their own branded signs up, but I found coming and going to the street side maddening. On my third time finding my way back to the entrance I got better at it, but otherwise spent 20-30 minutes each time walking in circles. I think if you were staying there longer than one night you would learn it pretty  quickly after that, but the construction on the street out front threw my google maps directions right out the window. I don’t know how long that construction is supposed to last, but just be more aware of your surroundings/directions if it is still going on so you don’t get (as) lost. I did not get upgraded here, and I’m not sure if would have mattered much at this location since the basic rooms had the amenities I wanted (I didn’t need it, but in addition to the laundry machine there was almost a full kitchen and sitting area).
 
**Hyatt Centric Ginza** (June)- https://imgur.com/a/hyatt-centric-ginza-oxyxx44
I think this hotel is a little polarizing from the open layout of the rooms, but as a solo traveler it worked fine for me and the location was great. The only problem was the 7-11 was not just around the corner (the horror!). This is one of the HCs that does not do bottled water, but provides empty water bottles and refill stations. I did not get upgraded, but I’m not sure that would have mattered to me (no real views to be had). Everything was very comfortable and I loved the lobby décor.
 
**Hyatt Regency Yokohama** (June)- https://imgur.com/a/hyatt-regency-yokohama-3XuASvg
I love this hotel, particularly the location. I walked from the train station to drop my bag, walked to a game at the baseball stadium, and then walked all along the waterfront area. I used a club access award here and managed to make that (technically tea time and dessert time) into dinner. The lounge was moderately crowded but had some interesting food, and nice loose leaf tea. My room was big and had good light, though no real views. Overall it was a great stay and I think a great value and location. I also just really love Yokohama and would love to go back there.
 
**Hyatt Place Kyoto** (June)- https://imgur.com/a/hyatt-house-kyoto-ngxi0Xs
It’s hard to beat being on top of a train station! Though I think some people find this location out of the way other than that (there are some restaurants around but I wouldn’t call it a main or busy area), it worked perfectly for me since I was planning on being out and exploring the whole time. I took a train first thing in the morning to Fushimi Inari and then ended up walking 20 miles around the city and only went back to the hotel in the evening. The room was just a basic HP room with no view (small courtyard facing), but it was so dark and quiet I woke up genuinely confused in the morning when my alarm went off. It seemed busy in the lobby, and had a notice posted going over the upgrade rules and restrictions in great detail like it’s something people get ruffled over frequently (ie no breakfast is standard), but I found it a great value and would have enjoyed the laundry room had I not been flying home the next day.
 
**Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor** (June)- https://imgur.com/a/hyatt-regency-boston-harbor-DkhVbrw
I stayed here on an FNC for a concert and loved it. It’s an odd mix- the convenience of an airport hotel, and lack of convenience to a bunch of other stuff, but still a destination and I got around easily with a combo ferry/T/Uber/hotel shuttle to airport. My room overlooked the water and I loved sitting and watching all the boats go by. It also came with some credit at the hotel restaurant through the resort fee (that I didn’t pay), so I got a burger and clam chowder takeout. It was… fine… it’s hard to mess up a burger but this one was nothing special. I appreciated the microwave on every floor though, as someone who often travels with food to cook to save money. I also really enjoyed the nautical themed décor throughout.
 
**The Venetian** (July)- https://imgur.com/a/venetian-VsChfc3
This was basically just a brand explorer check mark among other two other Vegas properties that trip. I liked the room less than Fontainebleu and Bellagio (it was huge but pretty dark and an older style) and I liked the pool area more than Fontainebeau but less than Bellagio (I compared them more thoroughly in a post here xxx). I didn’t eat anywhere there. The lobby was pretty crowded of course, but that area is definitely stunning. I had been to the building before but not spent the night. Overall there wasn’t anything Hyatt about it other than the night credit and badge, but I’m glad I checked it off. I got the casino hotel bonus points even though I registered for the promo after my stay.
 
**Grand Hyatt Macau** (August)- https://imgur.com/a/grand-hyatt-macao-qxmV2IU
My first Globablist stay, and a bit of a sleeper hit! I knew I wanted to spend a night in Macau and settled on the GH because I could use an FNC, and it was way nicer than I expected. It helped that I was upgraded to a suite- I didn’t need the space but the room was beautiful and I could watch the fountain show at the Wynn across the street from my bed. When I arrived in the morning my room was almost ready, so I waited and had an egg tart and coffee by the pool and then took the free shuttle into the central historic area to explore. I checked out the lounge but didn’t make it back while they were serving food to eat unfortunately (it looked beautiful though and had a great view). I walked around the “strip” area and brought takeout back to my room, sat in the again not-quite-hot-tub, and went to bed watching the fountain. The hotel was huge but didn’t seem very busy, and everyone was super nice and I felt like it was new-grand rather than old-grand like the GH Bangkok. I got the casino hotel points promo here too. The next morning I took the free hotel shuttle to the Zhuhai border and on my way back through Macau took it to the ferry terminal to Hong Kong. The casino hotel area of Macao is definitely an odd and confusing place, but I really appreciate the free transportation options everywhere.
 
**Alila Dong’ao Island Zhuhai** (August)- https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/s/JA5PV8O848
I wrote a full recap of this stay here because it was such a unique situation. I loved this stay and am so glad I went out of my way (I mean, as out of the way as Macau and Hong Kong really are) to go stay here.
 
**The Fleming (MMS)** (September)- https://imgur.com/a/fleming-dS8vdEV
This was mostly a brand explorer check mark, as I wasn’t sure I would get another opportunity to do it so easily (I have heard people have a had a hard time booking these, but I used points through the app with no problem). It was another stay that was just based around somewhere to be for the night, rather than a property to enjoy, so it didn’t matter that I booked a small room and didn’t get upgraded (nor was free breakfast available). I liked the nautical theme of the décor though and it was perfect for my needs, and close to the MTR. The points were fine for my one night, but they would need to be lower for me to get excited to stay somewhere that’s just a bed for the night.
 
**Grand Hyatt Hong Kong** (September)- https://imgur.com/a/grand-hyatt-hong-kong-z62tHdA
This was my first time using an SUA and I’m so glad I did- I loved the expansive harbor views and huge tub in the room, and the food and views from the lounge. I had tea time twice and breakfast once, and it all was delicious and beautifully presented. I had planned to have some time to spend at the hotel enjoying the views rather than being out exploring the whole day, and it was so lovely to enjoy the space in the comfiest bathrobe *ever.* I went for a quick swim and sat by the pool for a bit, and while it was really nice I wouldn’t say it quite matches the marketing photos in the app. I didn’t mind that the location was a bit out of the way from the MTR, but I can see how you might prefer a more central location. For enjoying a hotel space in HK though I highly recommend this one, especially if you can get lounge access. I imagine the non-suite rooms with water views were beautiful too, so I doubt you can go wrong there.
 
**Hyatt Regency Tsim Sha Tsui** (September)- https://imgur.com/a/hyatt-regency-tst-W1rUZ9P
I see this hotel compared to the GH a lot, and I can see why the central location provides benefits that the GH does not (it was convenient to have an MTR entrance across the street, especially in pouring rain, but I never figured out how to use that one as an exit and took google’s roundabout walking route from farther away to get back twice). Besides that though I didn’t find anything particularly special about the property itself. The lobby and rooms were corporate-themed (though the shower was probably my top one for the year), and my room didn’t have views that were anything special (a bit of water was visible, but mostly it was buildings). This may not be a standard experience though- I have heard people rave about the rooms- but this hotel was more in the “somewhere to sleep after being out all day” category rather than a place to enjoy on its own. The price was right for that though- it’s definitely a great value. I had breakfast in the lounge and it was good, though a smaller variety than the others. They explained an option to eat in the restaurant but I think maybe it came with a caveat, either a surcharge or limited menu, just something that made it slightly less convenient for me (apologies for not remembering this detail). They also described it as more crowded, so I avoided it. The lobby was crowded with people using the meeting space, and of course the whole neighborhood is crowded. I tried to go to the pool but couldn’t even get close enough to see it, as a T3 signal was in place and it seems that automatically activates hotel pool closures despite what the weather itself is actively doing (I don’t blame the hotel, I think everything there operates like that). I’m happy I spent the night there and recommend it, but to me the GH stands out more.
 
**Hyatt Centric Victoria Harbour** (September)- https://imgur.com/a/hyatt-centric-victoria-harbour-pqK5D9K
This hotel kind of fell in between the GH and HR for me. Yes, it’s farther out on the MTR, but it’s basically across the street from a station and had the water views I was looking for. I was upgraded (not sure of the category) to a corner room that had beautiful views out, and also in- I understand why they had a few reminders posted about the windows not being one way and to close the curtains for privacy! The T3 turned into a T8 while I was there, so the pool area was definitely closed and I spent more time in the room than I had anticipated because some of my scheduled activities were canceled. Some of the lobby/restaurant areas are under construction so there are tight walkways, but the signage was thorough and I didn’t mind that I needed to switch towers through the lobby to get to the lounge and restaurant. The lounge was very busy but had great food that I easily made into dinner. I had received an email from the hotel prior to my stay advertising a breakfast reimbursement for eating at a local neighborhood spot, but because of the weather I decided to stick to the hotel and made a point to get to the restaurant for breakfast early because I figured most of the other guests would feel the same. Had I been able to see the views from the restaurant I bet they were lovely, but the huge spread made up for the gloomy weather and it was a really lovely stay.
 
**Caption by Hyatt Central Sydney** (November)- I wrote a detailed review here: https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/s/d9YWFBNoB2
 
**Park Hyatt Sydney** (November)- https://imgur.com/gallery/park-hyatt-sydney-november-2025-globalist-yUbSah6
When I planned this trip I hesitated on booking because of the high points cost, but it seemed kind of like a when in Rome/bucket list thing to do a night here. I saw a lot of contrasting reviews of whether it is “worth it” and what to expect as a Globalist, but overall my experience was great. I booked the standard points room and was upgraded to a harbor view room, though being on the first floor had kind of an awkward amount of green space visible as well. Not complaining- I think I was lucky to get the upgrade! I got 1pm checkout as they said 4pm wasn’t available for that room category, and I didn’t push it since I didn’t need anything later. I spent some time at the lovely rooftop pool and had a fantastic breakfast with a beautiful view in the morning- I’m still thinking of those pastries. I wrote a more detailed review comparing it with my stays at the Four Seasons and Shangri-La but I can’t figure it where/if I should post it since it covers so many aspects (FHR, Edit, Hyatt, etc).
 
**Hyatt Regency Sydney** (November)- https://imgur.com/a/hyatt-regency-sydney-l02iLFN
I used an FNC for this and was upgraded to a harbor view room. While not as conventionally beautiful as Sydney Harbor, I loved overlooking the museum’s boats and walking around Darling Harbour- it’s a great location. Though check in was chaos with no clear line and people everywhere, the staff were all really nice and gave me a key to the lounge while I waited for my room to be ready (I checked in around noon, and only waited about ten minutes). The lounge had nice views and wasn’t too crowded at hors d’vers time, which I made into dinner. Sadly there’s no pool, but I did use the gym- a decent size with a decent variety of equipment. The hotel seemed extremely busy with events, not sure if that’s normal or not, so the elevators and lobby were all pretty crowded. I was warned that breakfast would be too, but since I had to leave early I went right at open at 6:30 (the main restaurant, breakfast in the lounge started at 7 and I had my choice) and it was quite empty. I’m sad I didn’t have time to linger at the buffet, as everything looked really good, but the things I did try were great. Overall I think this is a great value property, and my only complaint is that only one side of the bed had a USB port and it didn’t work (there was also one next to the desk that I used instead).
 
**Dream Hollywood** (November) https://imgur.com/a/dream-hollywood-by-hyatt-7V9LqBS
This was basically a brand explorer stay, taking advantage of an LA layover on the way back from Sydney. Because of that schedule I pretty much just hung out in the room and caught on sleep, and it couldn’t have been a lovelier place to do it. The room doesn’t photograph as well as it appears in real life- the light coming in from the big windows was beautiful, and very appreciated in the bathroom as well. I experienced no noise whatsoever, and it was walking distance to the metro (and for those playing the game, two office supply stores and a CSR eligible restaurant). My breakfast was huge and delicious- it was the perfect way to end my Hyatt vacations for the year.
 
**Honorable mention-** I did not spend the night, but got a full tour of the Hyatt Regency St. Louis at the Arch on a work trip and put together a document of its advantages (amazing proximity to arch plus baseball stadium with multiple dining options) and disadvantages (reported street noise and parking and plumbing issues). The meeting spaces were nice and had natural light, but were on the smaller side for our particular event needs. If I were planning a trip around visiting the arch I would stay there. https://imgur.com/a/hyatt-regency-st-louis-by-arch-eVre6k3
 
**Booked for next year:** Park Hyatt NYC, Andaz 5th Ave, Grayson, HC Midtown 5th Ave (February), HR Indianapolis (May, though would love opinions on it vs the HH/HP if anyone feels strongly), PH Seoul, GH Seoul, Andaz Seoul Gangnam, PH Shanghai, Shanghai on the Bund, UrCove Pudong East, PH Beijing, GH Beijing, Andaz Singapore, GH Singapore (June-July), Hotel de Louvre, PH Paris Vendome (August), HR Grand Cypress (tbd but with an FNC before April in case it jumps to a cat 5). Sadly my Globablist run will come to an end in 2027, but hopefully I can fit in one more international trip before then!

Hi everyone, I’m hoping someone can help me understand this.

I’ve believed in the Law of Attraction for years and tried so many manifestation techniques, but I always hit resistance—so much that I lose motivation and stop taking action. Recently, I started learning that manifestation is really about identity and belief shifts, so I’ve been working on that too.

To make things easier, I decided to practice manifesting something small today: a cup of coffee. I go to the same café every morning and it’s always effortless, so I thought this would be the perfect “easy win.”

But today, the café was unusually packed. Long wait, overwhelmed baristas, and for a moment I didn’t know if I’d even get my coffee. I eventually did—but it came with so much resistance that I felt confused. I wasn’t doubting, I wasn’t stressed, I genuinely believed it would be simple… yet the universe made it feel weirdly difficult.

So now I’m wondering:
Why is even a tiny manifestation showing resistance? What am I missing here? What do I need to shift?

Any insight from people who’ve been through this would really help. Thank you 💛",3,1765304423.0,lawofattraction,5,1.0,False
