When 2024 started I was in a toxic relationship where anything minor would lead to just bug dramatic arguments. This woman had severe infection and I took a whole month of remote work just to nurse her but couldn't stay in the last few days of the month because I had to urgently get back to work at my office (in a different city) and it is my dream job, something I'm passionate about. Around the end of March, my dad got hospitalized for a surgery and I wasn't really on the best of terms with him but I wanted to be there for him. We did everything we could, I spent all of my savings, arranged for the best doctors we could for opinions but still after 3 weeks in the hospital he passed away. And the damned hospital gave us a bill of 20Lakhs+ to handover the body. That toxic ex kept fighting for attention while my dad was still in the hospital, while I was running around to arrange things for him. 

After his death, I just went numb, I honestly couldn't feel anything for a while and relatives just patting my back, shoulders, head to offer condolences but I really couldn't even shed a year. Honestly I already accepted the fact that he'll pass away while he was in the hospital but now I was just numb. Couple of days before he passed away, his ICU doctor just intimated us that it's nearly impossible for him to make out of it, I didn't want to cry in front of anyone, so I just went to a movie alone, booked a movie which was barely booked and just let it out there. 

I couldn't keep up with that relationship so I just gave up. She wrote emails to threaten me that she'll kill herself, which just sort of pushed me more into depression but I somehow handled that situation and broke up with her. Also had to deal with the threats and calls from my dad's debtors. Handled it alone, paid some of it.

After I was out of my bereavement leave, it started to hit me, I didn't want to get out of bed or do anything. Wasn't really able to focus on work. It was to the point I fucked up a major deadline and let everyone down. I actually scheduled a meeting with my manager to resign honestly but I couldn't take it. He just calmed me down, told me to take a few days off and come back when I'm ready. There will always be work, but prioritize your mental health first.   

I took a week off, came back to office and just started again. My reputation tanked but my manager helped me a lot with positive criticism and I slowly got back my confidence and started working even better than before. I also accidentally met a woman before my father passed away on a flight, with whom I just shared that my father's in the hospital and I just vented out. I got her insta contact after he passed away and she just kept supporting me, pushing me to improve myself and I didn't even realise when I fell for her in all that. That one lady turned my life around for good. 

2024 was a honestly a hurricane but it ended with a peaceful note. There are still days when I miss my dad, I won't do anything just drink coffee in the balcony and just think about him. He wasn't really a good father but one thing he never gave up on was trying his best. Now that I think about it, honestly that made him the best. I'm trying to get better at my work, finally back to focusing on fitness again (used to be 130ish kgs and now around 88-90). 

And now... Just trying to do better ",1,1735963751.0,OffMyChestIndia,0,1.0,False
1ht5zu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ht5zu6/i_found_my_missing_brother_on_a_forum_for_the_dead/,I Found My Missing Brother on a Forum for the Dead,"I Found My Missing Brother on a Forum for the Dead

I never thought much about online forums until one of them brought my brother back.

Ryan had been missing for two years. One day, he went out to grab coffee and never came back. No suspicious activity on his bank account, no weird phone calls, no signs of struggle, just gone. The police said he'd likely been abducted, but without evidence, they couldn’t do much. My family fell apart. My mom stopped eating. My dad stopped talking. And I... I just stopped feeling.

Late one night, while spiraling through forums about unsolved disappearances, I stumbled upon a thread titled “Messages from Beyond: Connecting with the Lost”. It was buried deep within an obscure corner of the internet and full of people claiming to receive messages from the dead. It sounded ridiculous, but one comment caught my attention.

A user named “EchoingVoid” posted: “Sometimes the missing don’t know they’re gone. Sometimes they’re here, looking for home.” Below, someone replied, “How do you know?” and Void answered: “Because I am one.”

For whatever reason—grief, desperation, or lack of sleep—I created an account and messaged Void. I typed: “If you’re really one of the missing, prove it. Tell me something only you would know.”

The response came within minutes: “What do you want me to prove? That you once broke Ryan’s nose during a stupid fight over a game of Mario Kart? That he forgave you before you forgave yourself?”

My stomach dropped. I hadn’t told anyone about that—not even my parents. It was just one of those childhood moments you carry like a secret scar.

I asked: “Who are you?”

Void’s reply: “I think you know.”

The next few weeks were a blur. I spent hours every night talking to Void. “He” said the world he was in was a fractured reflection of ours—familiar but empty. The sky was always gray, the streets abandoned, the air heavy with silence. He couldn’t explain how he got there, only that he woke up in this place and couldn’t leave.

The more we talked, the more he sounded like Ryan. He even remembered details no one else could, like the nickname he used to call our childhood dog or how he’d secretly taped my embarrassing middle school dance recital to blackmail me later.

One night, Void said something that terrified me. He typed: “They’re watching me now. They don’t like that I’m talking to you.”

I asked who “they” were, but his responses became cryptic: “The shadows. The ones who keep us here. They don’t like noise.”

That was the last I heard from him for weeks.

Then, a new message appeared in my inbox: “Do you want to see me?” Attached was a link to a live video feed. I hesitated but clicked.

The stream showed a dimly lit street that looked eerily like the one Ryan and I grew up on. The houses were distorted, their shapes wavering as if viewed through heat haze. In the distance, a figure walked toward the camera. As they drew closer, I recognized his face. It was Ryan.

But something was off. His eyes were too wide, his movements stiff, like a puppet on strings. He smiled at the camera, but it wasn’t the smile I remembered—it was forced, unnatural.

He raised a hand and waved. In the live chat beside the video, he typed: “It’s me. I told you I was here.”

I couldn’t move. My heart felt like it was trying to escape my chest.

Suddenly, the camera shook violently. The shadows behind Ryan began to shift and ripple, forming towering figures with jagged edges. They moved closer, their distorted limbs reaching for him.

Ryan typed: “They’re coming. You have to help me. Find the door.”

The feed cut out.

I spent the next few days piecing together everything he’d said about his world, looking for clues about the “door.” It wasn’t much, but he’d mentioned a specific place from our childhood: an old, abandoned cabin in the woods where we used to play.

I drove there, half-expecting nothing. The cabin was just as we’d left it, rotting and overgrown. Inside, I found a trapdoor beneath a threadbare rug.

The ladder below led to a tunnel that stretched on for what felt like miles. At the end was a heavy iron door with strange carvings.

As I touched it, my phone buzzed. A message from Void: “They know you’re here. Don’t let them in.”

Before I could reply, the shadows began to seep through the walls, crawling toward me like living tar.

I shoved the door open and stepped through.

I don’t know how to explain what happened next. One moment, I was in the tunnel; the next, I was standing in the gray, empty world Ryan had described. The air was heavy, the silence deafening.

And there he was, standing a few feet away, staring at me with wide, desperate eyes.

“Ryan,” I whispered.

But before he could respond, the shadows surged forward.

The last thing I remember is his scream.

I woke up in my bed the next morning, clutching a piece of paper I’d never seen before. Written on it, in Ryan’s handwriting, were the words: “Don’t stop looking. There’s another door.”

I have cleaned the sensors and pressure sensor tested OK. Only when it is below 50 degrees outside it will appear to try several times to start and then lockout: Inducer starts, flame starts, blower even starts most times after startup, then flameout and inducer stops. I don't believe the amber flame LED ever lights on the PCBAG100 DSI Control Board when it fails. But the error LED blinks once = Lockout Due to Excessive Retries. I believe I will try to monitor the flame sensor current next, but I am thinking it may be the control board being affected by the cold, especially since I had to re-solder a trace under a relay before. I can replace it with OEM from ebay or it has been suggested to use Honeywell S9200U Universal Furnace Control, but I think I would want a qualified tech to do that?
  I have the service manual which is pretty good at explaining everything. It's the intermittency and happening before I get my coffee in the morning. I hope it's not the gas valve or pressure or PG&E  related. I would need to find a qualified tech in the 916.

1ht5t1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ht5t1c/is_my_husband_choosing_his_mom_over_me_or_am_i/,Is my husband choosing his mom over me? Or am I overreacting? ,"Alright so grab some popcorn. This is a long one. 
 Starting from the beginning, my husband and I moved to a different state because of his job,and also to focus on starting a family. We were both working so it was a bit tough doing both. So I quit my job and we moved. A year later we were blessed with twins, however they arrived at 26 weeks. When one of them was discharged about 3 months later the MIL came to visit. I originally didn't have any problems with her. Her first visit started out rough because she missed her connecting flight and was rebooked for the next day. I drove 8 hrs to pick her up ( my husband didn't want to do it). When we arrived home that's when all this drama started. 

Once she got her hands on the baby she wouldn't let anyone hold the baby. The only time she would let go is when it was time for her to go to bed, however once the baby started crying in the middle of the night. She would rush into our room where the baby was at and snatch the baby from my arms. I was still dealing with postpartum so I was so devastated and started crying. My husband didn't think anything of it and told me I was overreacting. 

After she left everything went back to normal. I thought maybe the mil was just excited for another baby in the family. ( she has 2 other older grandchildren from my husband's siblings. 

About 6 months later we got word that the other baby would be discharged, but still dealing with medical issues and need special medical equipment. My husband wanted a family member to move near us to help us out since it was gonna be a challenge for us. The mil volunteered and started moving within the next 2 months. While she was moving we were nice enough to have her stay with us until she was situated. Both her and my husband failed to mention that she invited her brother and his dog plus the sister to stay with us as well. I was so angry when they came by. The mil claimed she told me, but I ensured her I would remember a dog staying with us (at the time we had 2 cats). During their stay it felt like an Airbnb. Constant mess/ people in and out of the house/ no privacy, and again.... the mil and her siblings would not let me take care of my baby. What really made me rage is when I found out the mil gave the baby coffee. I yelled at both the mil and my husband, and either one of them found it a issue.I later found out the mil's brother posted a picture of the baby on his Facebook even though we told everyone not to post pictures. My husband didn't find it a big deal even thought he found it a big deal when my dad tried to post pictures. I offically knew I didn't want anything to do with this family when I heard the mil's brother calling me a bitch behind my back after everything that happened to this point. 

Since moving here and living 20 mins away from us. The mil would constantly do things that would infuriate me. She would come to our house while we were gone and clean and rearrange our stuff. She would constantly come over uninvited and not even ring the doorbell. She wouldn't like what the babies were wearing and change their clothes. She insist on bathing and feeding them and would get pissed off if we already did it. My husband would also infuriate me by always wanting her to come over like every other day. Always pushing me to have his mom baby sit. He even took the babies over to his mom's house while I was sleeping and didn't bother to tell me. I woke up so panicked and almost called 911. He even started lying to me about where he was taking the kids, but I would later find out he took them to the mil's house. 

At a certain point I put my foot down. I told my husband that I want distance from the mil, and even told her that. Anytime the mil name would be brought up we would fight. At one point he said something along the lines of ""I'm looking out for my family... me/ the babies/ and my mom"". I was like hold up what about me? He would also call me selfish and that I'm manipulative. 
It got to a point where couples therapy was involved. The mil finally gave us some space, but not by much. At one point she sent a email to my husband saying that she feels neglected and feels it's unfair to keep her away from her grandbabies. My husband begged me to lighten up and have her come by a little bit more. Making comments like "" you are keeping me away from my mom"". I said "" I'm not. You only visit her when you have the babies. You never go by yourself. That's on you"". Eventually I lighten up and told her to be on her best behavior. Well she was on her best behavior for about a month. 
She invited her self to thanksgiving and Christmas, and demanded to be there when the babies open their presents. Prevented us to open any of the present with the babies, and even demanded to cook the main food for Christmas. We told her don't cook any of the sides and she still cooks the sides. 
We found out we are expecting again, and already I'm finding out she wants to hold the baby as soon as it comes home and do all these things with the newborn. 
I'm just sooo frustrated and depressed and started going to individual therapy cause I feel like my husband is constantly choosing her over me.

But it has always done that. He figured out how to fix that problem a while ago, he was the one that found the posts online about “burping” your Keruig when it seemed to get clogged. When we first found it, I thought it was too expensive. Too fancy, what was wrong with our drip coffee machine or just our filter pour over, or even our French press. He drank sooo much coffee. He was so excited about buying this one, and was proud of his new technology coffee machine. It was going to ”help him get ready faster in the morning”. They have since stopped making the keruig vue, and the weird cups that were suppose to be more eco friendly were hard to find so we had to buy an adapter. But he loved it. He said it made him feel professional. It’s old, and if he were still here he would have probably replaced it three times over.

We talked about what we wanted to do for christmas and our anniversary and we agreed to combine them as they were during the same week and we were spending christmas separately with our own immediate families. We have good communication overall and we both agreed that we wanted to open christmas/anniversary gifts and do a dinner/movie date night. On the day of our anniversary my boyfriend forgot his gifts for me and asked to exchange gifts the next time we saw eachother which was fine by me. As a side note he felt really bad that he forgot to bring his gifts for me and kept hyping them up saying they were ""really good"" and that he couldn't wait for me to open them. We ended up getting food (I covered dinner) and saw a movie he was excited about (he covered the tickets). Overall I was happy with our anniversary date and he was too.

A week later we met up and finally exchanged gifts. We did not talk about budgets beforehand, however we had talked about love languages, what gift giving ment to us, and the types of gifts we give our friends and family which I used as a reference for the gifts that I got him. I also know that he has a list of things I've mentioned that I like throughout the year on his notes app which is why I was surprised and dissapointed by the actual gifts he got me. It was a pair of fuzzy christmas themed socks, a bookmark, a coaster, and a stuffed animal. Nothing is inherintly wrong or bad about any of these items but I imediately felt my chest tighten and started feeling overwhelmed after the gift exchange. I thanked him for the gifts and we went to dinner to his favorite restaurant. For context I got him a record of one of his favorite albums that came out this past year because he collects vinyl, a lego set that we could build together, a gift card to his favorite restaurant, I knitted him a beanie because he mentioned he wanted something knitted from me and he didn't have any winter hats, a ceramic mug that I handmade for him because he loves coffee, a framed photo of us from a festival we went to earlier this year, and a goodie bag of assorted chocolates that are relevant to my culture for him to try. I also brought over some beers for us to share.

That night I asked him whether having our anniversary so close to christmas was still a good idea and he said he thought it was fine. He then asked if I was dissapointed with what he got me and I said a little bit and that for my birthday, valentines day, and our anniversaries I would like to receive cut flowers and gifts that were a little more romantic, things that I had mentioned in the past that I like, or things related to my hobbies. He explained the bookmark was because I love to read and that the coaster made him think of me, and that he thought the pair of socks were cute and said they were the ""christmas"" part of my gift. I feel bad because he said that he tried his best to get me things he thought I would like. I can see where the thought behind each item came from but his gifts did not make me feel special and made me feel like I wasn't worth the extra thought or effort. I guess instead of a bookmark I would have preferred an actual book from my want to read list, or if he wanted to get me something to wear instead of cheaply made fuzzy socks I would have preferred a pack of nice high quality socks, pajamas, a sweater or even some lingerie panties for $15 would have been romantic and fun. Instead of the coaster he could have gotten me some nice yarn for my knitting/crochet hobby etc. and as for the stuffed animal he knows I like a particular brand and he could have asked me my favorite contenders and gotten me one of them. 

The next day we had a more in depth conversation. When I asked him what he thought a resonable budget for a gift for a significant other was he said $50 to $100 and I agreed. The gifts that I had gotten him cost $90. When I asked him how much the pair of socks, bookmark, coaster, and stuffed animal cost he said $50 however I find it difficult to beleive based on the quality of the items. He told me that he felt that he and the gifts were not good enough for me which is an insecurity he has voiced in the past. However his gifts made me feel not good enough for him or worth a decent gift. I feel that it is also relevant that we both make the same amount at our jobs. He is a spender and always buys himself nice things for his hobbies. I am more of a saver and rarely buy myself things, however I make sure to budget a decent amount for gifts for friends and family and for shared experiences. Throughout the year I have also bought him random things such as clothes and household items that he doesn't want to buy for himself (we live separetely but think pajamas, sweatpants, hand soap, cleaning supplies, hand towels, a french press after he broke his own etc.). That is why I am dissapointed and feel that he didn't put as much effort into a christmas/anniversary gift for me as he would for himself. He also said that now he doesn't want to get me flowers in the future because I had to ""ask"" for them which feels like very backwards logic to me. Anyways I don't know what to do because we already talked about it but I don't want to be dissapointed again in the future. My thoughts have been spiraling and after looking back at this past year together I worry about the patterns that I see. It all boils down to there is so much that I do and would do for him that he would not do for me.",3,1735962637.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

Sorry to interrupt your bone drone worship and o4 air unit leaks, but I have done some tests with the O3 air unit that I thought everyone here might be interested in, and anyone who is a gear head especially when it comes to cameras like I am would love. Hopefully whoever you are and your knowledge in camera speak, you can at least gain some insights into the O3 air unit or appreciate the effort that went into testing this!

# Introduction:

Something thats always bothered me about camera reviews that aren't full-on standalone camera bodies or lenses is the lack of scientific analysis about the specs on the device.

If you've ever checked out the nerdy side of photographer/filmmaker YouTube, you'll see sharpness tests, distortion tests, readout speed tests, bit-depth testing, dynamic range tests and god knows how many other tests. But the second you get to fully integrated devices that aren't your traditional camera, these tests disappear despite these devices becoming more and more capable and being used in place of those larger cameras in certain situations.

So! I'm here to make a small dent in that void with this small bit of testing on the O3 air unit. It's a little sad that I seem to be the first one to do this testing for the O3 air unit and that I'm doing this on the eve of the o4 air unit releasing, but hey I just got into FPV in the last 4 months so...

# The Tests:

I did 2 separate tests: Sensor readout speed, and lens FOV/35mm equivalents.

For those that don't know what those words mean:

A sensor readout speed is the time it takes the sensor to scan itself from top to bottom to produce a single frame. This differs from shutter speed by way that shutter speed it is the length of time any given part of the sensor is reading the light that hits it.

And a lens FOV/35mm equivalent is something integrated devices really only have to worry about, but it is looking at the field of view on the devices different modes (Ultrawide, Wide, and Normal in the case of the o3) and comparing it to what equivalent focal length that would be on a full-frame camera to get a better understanding of what view the device is producing.

For these tests, I ran through every possible combination of 16:9 4k, and 4:3 2.7k in 30, 60, 100 and 120fps with Steadyshot on and off (Labeled as EIS or Electronic Image Stabilization in the charts) and in D-Cinelike.

For me personally, 4:3 is the optimal aspect ratio for recording since vertical video is important to me and my future use of the O3, but, since 4k isn't available in 4:3, I had to test it in 16:9 and it's still important if you know the deliverable will only be 16:9. I skipped 50fps since I'm in North America and isn't something that should be used here, but tested 100fps since that's the max refresh rate of DJI goggles (30, 60, and 120fps resort to 60hz in the goggles).

# First Up: The Sensor Readout Speed Test

I used the same methodology as seen on this page if you want to learn more: [https://github.com/horshack-dpreview/RollingShutter](https://github.com/horshack-dpreview/RollingShutter)

Basically, a light is flashing at 500hz, the light creates horizontal bars across the sensor, when you take the image height divided by the height of bands measured times the number of bands measured, you are left with the sensor readout speed in milliseconds.

Image height / height of bands measured \* number of bands measured

I've done these tests before with my actual camera, but it was REALLY hard to get the results with the O3 because of how wide the lens is. I did figure out a way to jankily do it. But because of the jank, I wouldn't quite trust the results down to the 0.01ms that they're labelled to, I'd more trust it down to like 0.05ms.

With that out of the way, here are the results!

# Readout Speed Results:

https://preview.redd.it/zyrvb1yhjwae1.png?width=1266&format=png&auto=webp&s=04e8996696d03c66d54be56cff6977c3cf487936

# Readout Speed Analysis:

I knew going into this that the readout speeds of the sensor were going to be fast and not something to worry about like you would on a photo camera, but they ended up being more interesting than I expected because of 1 implication, and 2 mysteries!

In 4k30fps, 2.7k 30fps and to a lesser extent 2.7k 60fps, the sensor readout time is a fair amount longer than the higher fps modes. Typically when this happens with other camera manufacturers, it is because compromises had to be made on the higher fps modes. These are usually a lower bit depth with the initial recording of the sensor or is line skipping. Without doing a sharpness test, it's hard to know which one of those two things it is, BUT it is good to know that for the best raw image quality, shoot at 30fps.

The readout speed for the Ultrawide 30fps modes, along with the 30fps Normal modes are slightly higher and is likely to introduce the jello effect in fast freestyle flying, but if you're shooting 30fps, you're probably not after the absolute best readout speed. And in that case, 16-9ms is more than good enough for slow panning or other movements.

Now for the two mysteries. Going from 60fps to 100fps to 120fps in the same mode has the ever so slightest readout speed improvements every time. I know I mentioned not quite trusting these numbers down to 0.01, but it being consistent, and especially in the case of 4k modes, larger than 0.05ms differences, what the hell is going on??? These jumps are too small to be bit depth, or line skipping being turned on or off. It's possible there is still some amount of downsampling being done on every mode but it becomes less and less for every fps jump.

The other mystery is the case of Normal having a worse readout speed than Wide. My only theory on this is the distortion correction being applied is causing it, but I'd think the correction would be applied after the entire frame is captured which then shouldn't affect the readout speed of the frames.

# Up Next: The FOV/35mm Equivalents

I initially performed this test to see if there were variances from mode to mode in FOV because it might have helped explain the mysteries in the readout speed charts, but the secondary reason and honestly the only good reason to do the test was to figure out wtf the focal length of each mode was! Before going into this I assumed Normal was 24mm since thats the Normal FOV of a non FPV DJI drone, Wide I knew was basically Normal but with the distortion correction turned off, and Ultrawide was maybe supposedly 155 degrees diagonally which is absolutely insane. For reference, a 155 degree diagonal FOV is equal to a 5mm lens on a full-frame camera... Yeah right lol.

Making the test for this was fairly crude, and probably worth redoing for more accuracy (but this should be good enough especially if not a lot of people care). I had a craft mat that had every 10 degrees marked, I used those marks to make vertical lines on a large piece of construction paper that I'd then have facing the camera. This then measures the horizontal FOV of the camera, which because of the varying aspect ratios, is the only constant unit I can measure.

Issues with this setup and general issues trying to measure this camera: I don't know if the camera is level, skewed or anything with the paper. I don't get a bubble level on the unit so I can tell you the page ended up being skewed. I tried my best to estimate anyway.

Another issue is that focal length equivalents are really meant to measure rectilinear lenses, or straight corrected optics (like Normal mode). So Ultrawide and Wide are more than likely going to be off in terms of equivalents.

Here are the results:

# Horizontal FOV Results:

https://preview.redd.it/lot5spwljwae1.png?width=1266&format=png&auto=webp&s=014c20473827d93ccd8795b9274397d37f252362

# 35mm Equivalent Focal Lengths:

https://preview.redd.it/8sp5awonjwae1.png?width=1265&format=png&auto=webp&s=5215249231b6c7d13778508dc436efbd4b2a7c51

# FOV/35mm Equivalent Analysis:

I was honestly surprised at how wide every single mode is including Normal. A range of 8-16mm is quite frankly insanely wide. There are a couple of quirks I noticed in the testing though!

The first quirk I noticed was the 2.7k 100fps and 120fps modes had a tighter FOV than the equivalent 30fps and 60fps modes, and quite substantially at that! Wide became tighter than Normal, and Normal EIS became even tighter. I don't know if I somehow fucked something up while testing that made it appear this way like knocking the camera down (I don't believe so) but that result is very weird.

Another weird standout was 4:3 2.7k Ultrawide with EIS enabled. it was Identical to 4:3 2.7k Wide, whereas 4K was different. I have literally no idea why, it's 100% not a test issue so... huh.

If you're a filmmaker, you know what some of these focal lengths look like in your mind, and should hopefully give you a better idea of what to expect in each mode, I know it does for me. It also makes me significantly more intrigued by normal EIS mode since 14mm is broadly what is used for real estate interior shots and likely the focal length you will be near on large cinelifters (obviously doesn't help with framing when flying a cinelifter). And is the only mode to offer actual distortion correction (despite the smallest amount of correction in either Wide or Ultrawide)

# Conclusion:

Lots of interesting stuff if you're a camera nerd! 30fps modes should be higher quality images and shouldn't introduce the jello effect unless you're going crazy freestyle. The rest of the modes are fast as hell, but as you go higher, there might be slight image quality degradation that would need to be tested for another time. And the FOV of this lens is absolutely crazy wide no matter the mode you're in. Ultrawide and Wide are insanely wide, but might not even be fully captured because of the fisheye look of these modes. Normal mode is very close to what you'd consider your typical ultrawide camera lens.

# TLDR:

30fps modes are higher quality images, with still acceptable readout speeds. Ultrawide is 8-9mm, Wide is 9.5-14mm, Normal is 11.5-16mm 35mm equivalents.

Also have had no alcohol (daily drinker). 

Only one cup of coffee, today, to ease a headache. I put 1/4 the usual amount of instant espresso in my mug. The hope is to quit caffeine also. Have had some diet sodas. Baby steps.

Anyway, my face hurts. My eyeballs too. Sinus pains.

Constant brain fog. Tired but can’t sleep and when I do I keep waking up.

I keep having to take deep breathes a bunch due to anxiety and “tight breathing”.  I’m very irritable. 

I keep looking outide toward my porch and have to remind myself it is over.

It’s actually just beginning. 

Who even am I, healthy? What am I capable of? Just think of the energy? The focus! The healthy and awesome version of myself. 

I’m pretty excited. I wrote this to remind myself. If you read this boringness, please offer support because I like it.

Today I went out with Bailey, 3.8 pounds / 14 week cavapoo for a coffee. I took a water bottle, blanket, snacks, toys, pee pads, toys and a million other things that I didn’t need:use. It was so heavy. 
My question is; what essentials do you take when you are out with a puppy and how do you carry it all around as well as handle the puppy? And your own belongings (purse etc)?

There are much bigger creators, (like Ana Wolfermann for example, which why don’t they hang out anymore?!?!) who are rarely discussed on Reddit, and it makes me wonder why Brooke doesn’t notice all the discourse about her online and adjust what she’s doing. She considers this her job, but a lot of people don’t seem to like her content. It’s surprising she hasn’t changed things up. Like I work a 9-5 and if my boss, coworkers, or clients weren’t happy with my performance, I’d have to improve or find a new job. Why doesn’t she see that?

I also just find her content so overdone. Like to me NYC is a place for pretty driven people, so her “I’m gonna make a coffee then go to Pilates” is just so boring.

So yeah, that's the itinerary so far and I would really love for everyone's thoughts and advices. To be more specific maybe I will just list the following questions:

* Your thoughts on the restaurants we are planning to visit? and the temples as well.
* Additional places we can visit. Especially those on the way to the places already listed.
* Places in the itinerary that I should reconsider.
* Should I still find a way to try Jay Oh's Tom Yum and Jay Fai's Omelette? I heard the lines are crazy
* I was thinking of trying Muay Thai as well for the first time, could it be the move?
* Where is the best place to buy (Class A) football jerseys and how much should I expect them to be?
* Best coffee shops and clothing boutiques to visit as my girlfriend loves them.
* Two friends (one grew up in BKK, another works there currently) recommended JODD's but I heard it's a tourist trap? Is it really?",4,1735961509.0,ThailandTourism,1,1.0,False
1ht5az8,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1ht5az8/stomach_acid_buildup/,Stomach Acid Buildup?,"Hello Reddit
I am a 25yo Male who just got out of the military about 1 year ago. The drastic lifestyle change caused me to put on a ton of unhealthy weight. I decided to start intermittent fasting again (I did it for about a year before I joined the military) mainly for weight loss and other health benefits. I also have been dry/sober for a little over 1 month.

Discipline isn’t a problem for me, and I work Graveyard shift, so I did 18:6 for 1 week and felt good, and on new years shifted to 20:4.

I have felt great on 20:4 and would like to continue for at least 4-6 months, I have been virtually OMAD on 20:4 with the exception of black coffee which I do drink 1-2 cups at the start of the 4.

My biggest issue right now is Heart Burn/Acid Reflux.

I do not eat within between 2am and 8pm (when I lay down for bed) and no matter what, I have extreme heart burn. I tend to roll around a lot when I sleep and the heartburn has been enough to wake me up. Acid reflux was a small struggle for me for about 2 years in my early 20s until I solved it via not eating within 4 hours of bed, so this new issue seems to be unrelated, rather, the issue is my body overproduces stomach acid compared to the amount of food consumed.


Has any one else had this issue? And if so, how did you navigate it? Should I spend more time on 18:6 to let my body adjust itself slower? Please help.",1,1735961433.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

The trip through R-space was pleasant – the bridge squad was present but only necessary for emergencies. Gryzzk decided to use the time to do more than warm his chair, scheduling additional training and drills for his command. Overall, the crew was receptive to the training – there were additional suggestions afterward, mostly centered around how to adjust the gravity. After running several drills in various configurations, it seemed that the crew worked best in Terran standard in an emergency. Certain other aspects were being ironed out as well, with the mess hall trying new foods and blending spices together. It was not entirely successful – there were adverse reactions - nothing dangerous, but definitely not palatable to the testers.

Overall, spirits were high. Rosie in particular was still riding a high of sorts, as the last few breakfasts she'd been speaking more and listening to a few of Tucker's improbable stories regarding his past. Her displayed breakfast was starting to have more Terran influence as well, which seemed to be putting Tucker at ease. Gryzzk himself tried a few things, but Terran breakfast choices seemed bland overall. He was going to have to remember to take a job going to Terra and visit the fabled land of Grandmama Thibedeaux if the opportunity arose.

The thought was occupying his mind as he entered the bridge to see Edwards with a tablet in hand and an expression on her face that he'd learned was a Terran in Deep Thought. She glanced over at him when he sat down.

""Cap'n, remember that history thing you put me on?""

""I do recall, yes.""

""Well, we found a couple things – first, both of your planets hate losing like at a genetic level, so when you lose or screw up something fierce, it basically gets erased. So we first had to merge what we knew, and overall it looks like you've never actually had a revolution that brought in something new. Most time of the time it's less 'We're free from the nobles kicking our teeth in' and more 'under new management'. And to keep everyone in line, your everything is controlled by people above you, and you control everything about people below you. Cap, you seem to be an exception but I would like to confirm that later by maybe talking to some other Lead Servant types."" She paused to sip at her coffee. ""One thing that I saw was there's never been a systemic upheaval. To contrast, back on Terra thousands of years before we had spaceflight some folks got mad at the royals on an island and made up a thing called the Magna Carta. Short version was that even a king had to answer to the law. Y'all don't seem to do that - seems like it's always top-down, through both histories. Anyway, that's the problem, and the solution isn't easy. I mean even in Terran history, there's always blood, fighting, wars around stuff like this. Maybe y'all can figure out how to do what we can't.""

""The leaders answer to the Clan Way."" Gryzzk's response was automatic. ""If they fail, the Clan falls.""

Edwards shook her head. ""Not that I've seen – from what I've read, the last clans that fell were during the whole getting to space kerfluffle. And that was a special kind of wreck that's probably not going to happen again. If the guys at the top are serious about changing, it's gonna take more than some emissaries and a few back and forth trades. Y'all are gonna have get back together and make it so that going to war with each other'd cut your own throat. As for how you do that..."" she shrugged. ""Hellifiknow. I'm just a grunt that runs a sensor board and likes old stuff. Maybe more stuff like this ship, y'know? Tell your old boss how we do biz here, and see if they can maybe apply it.""

""That may be an idea. If you have a text of this Magna Carta, I think Lord A'kifab would take an interest. Meanwhile, we have business to attend to."" Gryzzk shifted in his chair and set his tablet and teacup in their respective spots before selecting the all-hands channel. ""Attention crew, this is Captain Gryzzk. We will be arriving at Vilantia Prime later today, and with that we will be standing down for few days. During that time, half of the ship will be on shore leave for a day, and then the other half of the crew will be on shore leave. Do as you will, but remember that you are representing all of us during that time."" Gryzzk glanced over to O'Brien, who appeared to want to say something. ""Prior to departure, each half of the ship will be receiving a briefing from the First Sergeant. Attendance is mandatory prior to leaving the ship."" Gryzzk closed the channel, but he could still hear the crew cheering.

""Cap, this could be entertaining – you taking your daughter down too?"" O'Brien glanced over at Gryzzk.

""I...I actually hadn't considered it."" Gryzzk admitted lamely. ""I don't know that I would be welcomed.""

""Not to put too fine a point on it, but the ship's captain needs a break too. The only people who aren't going to go on leave are the XO and Tucker. Tucker because he *never* takes shore leave, and Rosie because her emitter doesn't have the range. So shut up and figure out if we're day one or day two.""

""We?""

""We."" O'Brien's tone brooked no argument.

""I thought you didn't like high-G environments.""

""The girls'll suck it up this time.""

Gryzzk looked puzzled, but nodded. ""Very well. Bridge squad, we'll be taking our shore leave on the second day. Prepare appropriately.""

The next few hours through R-space carried a different scent – everyone seemed to be anticipatory in some way. For his own part, Gryzzk had a small knot forming in his stomach. The idea of returning to Vilantia was pleasant but at the same time he was still a Nameless. But that was in fact tomorrow's problem – for now, bathroom rotation needed to be done in anticipation of exiting R-space, and they still had to escort their ships to port.

The exit was smooth, with no ships in their way. As they were the last to exit, the ships began moving toward Vilantia almost as soon as the *Twilight Rose* was back in normalspace. The tension on the bridge began to rise slightly as Gryzzk noted the squad performing action almost before he'd ordered them to. O'Brien was exercising the guns, Hoban tested the thrusters and controls, Edwards had pushed as much power as she dared into the active sensors, and Reilly was scanning and filtering message traffic – overall, the only thing Gryzzk had to do was watch and sip at his tea. In order to do something useful, Gryzzk played some popular music from Vilantia on the bridge sound system. It wasn't easy, as a majority of the songs that were popular now were about the war and defeating the Hurdop - he finally settled on the more traditional instrumental songs.

""Cap we got a ship approaching hard and fast – ident signal says it's the *Throne's Grace*, no active weapons yet."" Edwards was calm as she spoke, while Hoban immediately maneuvered the ship up and around to allow a cleaner sensor sweep.

O'Brien followed up with her report. ""Firing solution in place, shields up and weapons hot.""

""Continuous update on the firing solution until they're in communication range.""

""Hooah.""

""Reilly, advise the *Voided Warranty* that the inbound is probably friendly. Time to comm-range with the *Throne's Grace*?""

""Current speed, seven minutes.""

Gryzzk felt a chill settle over the bridge – while the two fighting ships in the flotilla could certainly deal with a single ship, the difficult portion was the other ships in the area. O'Brien kept her track updated, and she was good but at the same time one error would be catastrophic.

Reilly had locked the forward view to the incoming ship, and from Gryzzk's perspective it was impressive – the *Throne's Grace* was the Vilantian homefleet flagship, and it showed – it was large, bristling with weapon clusters and small escort shuttles. If a ship could move with casual arrogance, this one did.

""They're hailing us.""

""I suppose we should answer them.""

""It would probably be rude to send them to voicemail.""

Gryzzk chuckled softly as the image resolved to a female Vilantian wearing the robes of the Trade Ministry who was quite deliberately not looking at Gryzzk. ""I am Senior Undersecretary Ah'nuriel of the Vilatian-Hurdop Trade Cooperative. On behalf of the Trade Cooperative, we welcome the *Twilight Rose* and her crew. We congratulate you and offer additional escort for your ships in this time."" There was a pause. ""We also invite your bridge staff aboard for a meal and discussion of the future once we are in orbit of Vilantia.""

Gryzzk nodded to Rosie, who spoke in reply. ""This is Rosie, Executive Officer of the *Twilight Rose*; on behalf of the senior staff, we accept your invitation.""

The rest of the trip was mercifully lacking in events which allowed Gryzzk some time to coach everyone on the niceties of protocol.

""The situation is unique. Normally as a Nameless, I don't exist – however, being the ship's captain allows some leeway to acknowledge me by title. That said, expect the minimum with respect to politeness and food along with Vilantian standard gravity. I'd eat a snack before we go over. It might help.""

Hoban spoke up. ""Define 'bare minimum', Cap.""

""Bread, water, and no chairs. And we will be expected to show gratitude while we receive whatever news they have.""

""So we say 'Thank you sir, may I have another' while they paddle us?""

Gryzzk nodded. ""This is a ship of criminals and recent enemies led by a Nameless – the only reason we're even in the system is because our ship flies under the Terran flag. The only unknown as far as the Trade Ministry is concerned is the Terrans, and they're using the Trade Cooperative as a legal shield so that we're not making any deals directly with the government. Most likely you'll be treated similarly to me.""

""Because that always ends well."" Hoban kept an eye on his console while speaking.

Gryzzk nodded. ""I have a feeling the Trade Minister wishes to assert himself. First Sergeant Brooks wounded his pride at their last meeting.""

""Among other things."" O'Brien grumbled. ""I'll never be able to top that.""

""Never say never – you may have an opportunity later to have a discussion with the War Minister. In the ranking of ministers, the War Minister is senior to Trade.""

""So I whip his ass...I like the sound of that.""

Gryzzk shook his head. Some day he might understand why the Terrans enjoyed fighting those above their station, but not today.

""In any event, since it is only the Senior Undersecretary, dress uniforms are not required. This is in theory a casual first meeting where we will be tested for behavior. Presumably, they'll have something for us to agree to – it is the Ministry of Trade, after all. Be polite – the Ministry can kick us out of port. In any event, you are dismissed as soon as we receive instructions from Orbital Control.""

Gryzzk left and had the printer make himself something to eat to calm himself before he decided to wear his dress uniform. It may not have been formal, but he did want to provide as solid a first impression as he could.

As he walked to the docking area he noticed that the rest of the squad had also decided to go with their dress uniforms – Gryzzk silently thought that whatever the Undersecretary offered, the bridge squad would not be compliant. He could only hope that they were polite during the meeting.

The docking area flashed green and the door slid aside to allow the squad to throw themselves across to the far end where they waited. And waited. Finally the door creaked itself open, as if the ship itself was hesitating to let them board. Once the door opened, the Undersecretary stood before them clothed in Trade Ministry robes and disdain.

Gryzzk exhaled softly. ""Permission to come aboard?"" This was the first test of resolve – if another member of the squad spoke, they would be treated as the authority for the rest of the meeting.

Several minutes passed while both groups waited for the other to say anything else. Finally the undersecretary gave the barest of nods as she saw that none on the crew were going to be repeating the request.

Gryzzk led them into the foyer, which was extravagantly decorated and also had no visible doorway among the silver curtains. This was going to be as far as they were allowed to go, but the gravity was normal – for Gryzzk anyway. The rest of the crew sighed and exhaled as they were half-again as heavy as they were in Terran standard.

There was no preamble from the Undersecretary – she simply waved a finger at a stack of documents. ""On behalf of the Vilatian-Hurdop Trade Cooperative, sign.""

Gryzzk was taken aback for a moment before remembering that tablets and electronic communications were reserved for more senior government ministry members. ""Reilly, take a moment and scan the documents please. XO, assist with interpretation and potential legal consequence.""

Reilly chuffed softly as she took out her tablet and went to work. ""What century are we in here Cap...""

The undersecretary blanched, her scent nervous. ""You are not meant to read these now. Sign, and do as you are bidden by the Trade Cooperative.""

""Undersecretary, I will not commit my fur to an unknown. Nor will I have my crew committed without knowing what we are expected to do, and what we may expect in return. There are certain terms which we cannot legally accept – those terms would invalidate the entirety of the contract. I would not have the businesses of Vilantia known as ones that cannot write an agreement properly.""

Rosie's report waited until Reilly had completed the scanning. ""Captain I count seven clauses within the contract that are in violation of Terran treaty and four more which may violate the standards of the Collective. With your permission I will revise and send a counter-proposal.""

The Undersecretary inhaled sharply. ""You would have this...*thing* barter for you?""

""Madam Undersecretary. That 'thing' is my XO. She has a responsibility to the welfare of the ship and crew. So yes, I will have her barter for us – if the Ministry wishes to go afoul of law, that is the Ministry's concern. We seek profitable resolution with the Vilatian-Hurdop Trade Cooperative. If that is not your goal, we will depart to perform our contracted duties. There are other Ministries who have overlapping responsibilities.""

There was a long pause from the undersecretary. Her scent was oddly one of satisfaction. ""We do seek the same.""

""Then allow us to ensure that what we promise falls within the bounds of law.""

""Very well. Will this take long?"" Undersecretary Ah'nuriel seemed quite eager to know.

""It may, depending on the various nuances of law. Use the time as you see fit, Undersecretary.""

""All that you need know is contained within.""

Rosie spoke quietly. ""Captain, this contract contains several unusual items. Specifically there is a clause calling for forfeiture of pay should the Minister of Trade be 'groinally assaulted' at any time during or immediately after a designated job.""

""Counter with a proposal that specifies conditions where such an action is required.""

Rosie smirked for a moment. ""Done.""

""Very well. Undersecretary, I will need to review these further once we have returned to our home, however I believe for now this has been a very...enlightening meeting. If the Trade Cooperative approves of our revisions, please communicate that to us via our home port.""

There was a dismissive wave. ""So you say. You may take the documents. In fact I insist.""

The bridge crew was silent on the way back, but once the docking ring retracted there were words.

""That was annoying."" Edwards twisted a bit as they walked back to the bridge.

Gryzzk shrugged. ""That was normal. They wanted to show that one of them was equal to all of us.""

""Except she ain't.""

Rosie broke in. ""My Lord Captain, the documents provided have a coded message.""

Gryzzk stopped short. ""And the message?""

Rosie looked grim. ""It says 'Help us.' Signed by Undersecretary Ah'nuriel.""",10,1735961359.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

Disclaimer that I have never smelled the originals of any of these so these really are 100% blind.  Not the smartest thing to do but I at least went in with an educated guess if I would like them based on reviews and listed notes. 

**Vintage Radio** **- 10/10 -** Probably my favorite one and also happens to be the first one I bought. It smells like skittles and incense to me which I love. Very sweet in the opening with a nice creamy lavender that fades into a woody incense drydown. I will most likely get a backup bottle of this as I feel like I can wear this all year long. Great projection and longevity.

**9pm** **- 6/10 -** Turns out I don't love the apple notes in this but do like the rest of it. Very sweet, hard for me to pick out the individual notes besides the apple and maybe a bit of lavender. Scent is linear though so don't expect any evolution throughout the day. Has good projection and longevity. 

**Nitro Red** **- 5/10 -** With the insane hype around this one you could understand when I didn't like it that my disappointment was immeasurable and my day was ruined (jk). Although I do love the very fresh watermelon opening, there is a dirty background in the drydown (patchouli?) that I really don't like which is so unfortunately because without that note the rest is amazing. I am hoping the scent grows on me. Nuclear projection and decent longevity.

**Khamrah Qahwa - 10/10 -** To me this smells nothing like angels share but is amazing in its own way. Very nice blast of vanilla sweetness, spices, some boozy notes and a subtle coffee background to tie it all together. Incredible projection and longevity too. 

**CDNIM EDT - 9/10 -** I do not experience any harshness in the opening for my bottle, just a nice lemon essential oil smell with some pineapple that leads into the beautiful smoky and woody drydown. Definitely understand the hype. I may branch out to the EDP or LE if I ever finish this bottle. Great projection and average longevity, 

**Honor & Glory - 7/10 -** Very sweet pineapple opening that dries down into creamy pepper, turmeric and sandalwood.  There is something a little screechy in this that makes my nose tingle but I do like the scent. Does not smell like any cake I've ever had so don't really understand those reviews. One thing is I am a little unsure when to wear this. It feels like it wants to be a winter scent and a summer scent at the same time. Strong projection and longevity.

**Maahir Legacy - 8/10 -** A very fresh lime and mint scent that reminds me of a fancy shaving foam. Dries down with some pleasant herbal notes while retaining the opening freshness. Great projection and average longevity. 

**The Kingdom - 8/10 -** It kind of smells like 9pm in the opening without the apple and with an added earthy chocolate background which I assume comes from the tobacco and tonka. Like a much more sophisticated version of 9pm which is much more pleasant to my nose. Dries down into a sweet tonka scent with a touch of lavender. Good projection and longevity.

**Liquid Brun - 9/10 -** A very nice mix of vanilla, cinnamon and orange blossom.  This one I keep trying to smell it on myself as there is something intoxicating about the scent. Interesting how many say this is blind buy safe because it smells nothing like the average stuff you smell on the street, it is quite unique imo. Strong projection and longevity. 

  
Overall I am happy with my purchases having zero background in fragrances and just getting into it for the fun of it. I don't plan on growing this collection too much bigger but I still do have my eye on Al Nashama Caprice and Liam Grey, which I may pickup the next time a sale rolls around and they are in stock.   If anyone has any suggestions as to what else I might like based on this review I am all ears. ",5,1735961307.0,fragranceclones,2,1.0,False

What is everyone using as an applicator for cushion foundations other than the original one it came from? Has anyone heard of the TirTir applicator falling apart so fast?",1,1735961168.0,AsianBeauty,1,1.0,False

Good day to all,

The last post I made to this was nearly six months ago - something I can seldom believe, but hey, sometimes that's just how I play the Sims - a binge of content and play for a month or two, and six months off. But, I was reminded of this wonderful series by my partner, and decided to continue, as I already had the story bulletpointed and written.

To recap, this is the story of my Ashwell Legacy - a twist on the Matriarch Challenge with its own narrative written in and woven between the gameplay. Effectively, authentic gameplay, shaped into words and story.

If you'd like to read the story from the first part, you can find Part 1 on my profile quite easily. So, without further ado, let's continue the Ashwell Legacy into the second Generation...

Also a preface - I was silly enough to not grab a few pictures in between the first and second born, so you'll have to put up with my awesome writing instead!

# Chapter 3: The Next Generation (Continued)

Niamh looks up from the grey book in her hands on the small couch. She hadn't confirmed the pregnancy, but somehow, she just knew. It seemed... odd. A pregnancy, yet no sign of a male sim, no contact with one... at least not in... that way. Just her and Amy. Throughout her teenage years too, she had felt no such desire to do such an act nor socialise in such a way with a male sim. Was it a marvel of science, something supernatural? Or something different?

She ponders what it means over that coffee she intended to make Amy that morning. She watches the temperature rise, the brown liquid pour and the playful hiss fill the space as she looks around her newly built home. It was by no means anything special, but this was hers. Something she could be proud of and something to pass on, if her pregnancy was to be confirmed.

[Her home really is barebones, but it's hers.](https://preview.redd.it/cnf6hy45evae1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fae0067704a06059fd1fb21a72327534ec5c8de)

Amy, roused by the sound of her morning coffee pouring, enters. Somehow, even she knows as she moves across the grey carpet, and embraces her wife from behind.  
""Sounds like you had quite the morning in the bathroom, honey."" Amy playfully jests as Niamh takes the cup from the kitchen, passing it over her shoulder.  
""You could say that... I think it's the start of something magical."" Niamh responds, equally as playfully, trying to keep her composure, though in her head she's already coming up with a hundred ways to sneak a test.

To think it wasn't that long ago she was sleeping in a bag in a closed gym and on the streets out of the heavy rain, to being almost ready to pass onto the next generation...

The test confirmed exactly what Niamh had suspected - news that brought the two to tears with excitement and into each other's loving embrace once again. Though, the excitement would be short lived, eroded by a slight sense of dread. This was the Ashwell's first new arrival, after all. And yes, while they had their house, between the two of them, they had less than 400 simoleons to rub together, and only a single bedroom. There just wasn't the space to bring in a little one.

Amy knew what this meant - double shifts. Every conceivable penny needed to be on hand to make the space habitable for a newborn. A newborn that would inevitably be along in no time at all. As sad as it may be, Amy would barely see her new wife. Evenings spent normally curled up on the couch with Niamh with a cup of hot cocoa and a bowl of spaghetti and veggi source were replaced with long, gruelling evenings staring at a computer screen at the laboratory, typing away data. Organising ingredients and experients. Tapping away on the keyboard to process the scientific experiments the scientists were too lazy, or perhaps too important to do themselves. Come nearly midnight, she would be logging off, leaving an office long vacated, with eyes bloodshot and tired, to return home to her wife already asleep with the rest she so desperately deserved. In the end, it would all be worth it...



# Chapter 4: The Upbringing

The snow begins to melt across Sunset Valley. The cold and bitter chill in the air finally begins to let up, as the Seasons usher in that of spring. And finally, the sun is shining over the town. With winter having been a desperate rush for survival, a hurried endeavour to put up a shelter, it comes as a welcome feeling for Niamh.

Though the couple would not get a reprieve. One morning, still tired, and oh-so-worn out from the long and agonisingly long shifts at the laboratory, Amy opens her eyes to the small, familiar bedroom they share well before the usual alarm. She sighs in exhaustion as her eyes find the clock on the bedside. 5am. Though as she turns over, she curiously, she finds Niamh is already out of the bed. At first, she hears her in the next room; her sleep dazed mind hearing her loving wife singing in the shower. Her head rests back on the pillow in relief. Until she listens more closely. It wasn't singing, and the water was definitely not running. In a sudden blind panic, she throws off the warm covers, and darts out of bed, practically crashing through the door and into the bathroom, nearly falling over Niamh's heels this time.

""Niamh! Niamh, what's wrong!?"" She shouts out as she bursts into the bathroom. Clutching her stomach against the bath, Niamh looks up at her wife with glazed over, desperate eyes.  
""Amy! It's... It's time. We have to go!""  
""Time!? Now?""  
""Yes! We have to go the hospital!"" Niamh almost shouts over her as she painstakingly gets to her feet, aided by Amy.  
""Leave... leave it to me, I'll get us there!""

With no car between the two women, a very poor taxi driver being hailed from the street was the unlucky man to help them downtown.

It was quite the ordeal for the young couple. Several hours of being tended to by frantic doctors and nurses, one of which being the lovely Jamie, who almost refused to leave Niamh's side as she's hurried through for the painful close delivery. A tight grip upon her hand, and encouragement from both wife and nurse, and the two women welcomed a girl to their now growing family unit. The two proud parents embrace with their newborn, the tears streaming down their face, overcome with emotion as they lovingly look to their daughter, the next generation of Ashwell.  
""Have you thought of a name, my dears?"" Jamie asks them compassionately, straightening her green scrubs.  
""I... Don't think we'd even thought about it."" Amy breathlessly answers, looking to her wife.  
""I'd... I'd like to continue the family tradition. I was named after the Irish root... and I want to do the same."" Niamh almost determinedly answers, clutching her daughter closer. Amy, sensing this was something Niamh had decided long ago, nods encouragingly to her. ""I want to name her... Caoimhe.""  
""Caoimhe... Ashwell. I like it."" Amy approvingly grips her wife's waist, embracing her that little bit closer.

The Ashwell clan had grown from 2 to 3, and the couple proudly introduced little Caoimhe to it. Though, little did Niamh or Amy know, that Caoimhe wouldn't be the only unexpected addition to the family. Oh no, not at all.

The two parents found taking to looking after the little one surprisingly... easier than they had expected. Sure, it meant a lot of interrupted sleep, not to mention having to tag team between them on who would get out of bed to see to their little ones needs. But the experience would grow to be one of the most rewarding experiences of their lives. For Niamh, she had come up from nothing to what was objectively still close to nothing. But now it had an even bigger purpose; it was the structure; it was the framework for giving another Sim, a Sim of her own, the best start they could get in life. And this was a purpose she was determined to fulfil. She would make sure Caoimhe didn't have to effectively live in a sleeping back for seasons and jump into the beds of people she'd known for a evening just to survive. She'd have a shelter over her head, no matter what. For Amy, this now meant that despite being fun loving and care free in the way she did things, this meant a big shift in how she did things. It was no longer about her and her wife. No longer just two adults having fun and enjoying their life. This was now giving Caoimhe the best they could.

[But the fun wouldn't stop at Caoimhe.](https://preview.redd.it/nxu033sflvae1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=3015f8368ae916ff38250ef7daba70bf02393e67)

 But the ""coincidence"" around Niamh's pregnancy quickly vanished when she found herself with the familiar morning sickness once more, after an exceptionally passionate night of WooHoo with her wife, almost as a toast to all that their lives had achieved so far. Just mere days after the birth of their first, Niamh was giving birth to their second child, and welcomed Caitlin Ashwell to their family, bringing the Ashwell clan to four.

With two little ones in the house, Niamh and Amy had to very quickly make amendments to the property. Fortunately, those extra shifts Amy had picked up allowed her to commission a second room. With a rejig of their kitchen layout, they had just enough space to accomodate both children. It would undoubtedly be a cramped set of living conditions, but the couple were determined to make it work.

https://preview.redd.it/ggyzf3m2mvae1.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=69b7cd8c008bc2b6218f779e482c9a00aa044d2e

Being just days apart in age, Caitlin and Caoimhe would be taught to walk and talk by their loving parents. If the two had had it their way, neither of them would be out of the house. But the bills wouldn't pay themselves, and the laboratory desperately needed Amy back, having become reliant on those extra hours she had been putting in. Granted, the leave she was granted was a good reprieve, but normality was an inevitable fact of life. With Niamh only leaving to busk when necessary, the two took to being parents, and it wasn't long before the two were attending school.

And that's when the future of the Ashwell's would be taken in a direction that'd see Sunset Valley rocked for generations to come.

Both girls were talented in school, with Caoimhe already shaping up to be deeply perceptive and brave, finding very little to be scared of, whether it be the tougher kids, the dangers of the outside world or standing up to her teachers, much to their chagrin. Though despite being that little bit rebellious, she had a very clear sense of right and wrong, and sound herself being the former on most occasions. And with this rebellious streak came an uncanny ability to schmooze just about anyone. Caitlin, on the other hand lacked her older sister's bravery, but was shaped to be an Artistic Genius, with an absolutely insatiable love of books and the written word. A true bookworm to her heart. She was piling through complicated maths problems, completing the entire exercise before her peers were even through the first few questions - a deep curiosity nurtured through her toys she had as a toddler. The blocks and drawing paper had done more than just give her hours of fun at home, and had given her a real headstart. And while neither were financially advantaged, both knew nothing else, and knew how to thrive with very little to work with.

However, one Saturday morning, little Caitlin plucked up her courage and went into the living room where her mother's were watching the morning news, coffee in hand.  
""Oh, Caitlin. It's early for you, sweetie. Are you okay? Would you like some breakfast?"" Niamh cries happily, about to get up to see to her little one.  
""No, that's okay mom... But I want to ask something..."" Caitlin nervously says, tucking her little hands in her pyjamas.  
""Anything, darling, anything at all."" Amy smiles broadly at her daughter.  
""Erm... I really want to... Go to the art gallery today. Do you think I could?"" She timidly asks, trying to avoid eye contact with her parents.  
""Oh of course you can! Bless you, you're so curious! Just remember, okay, you take the bus like you do to school. Keep your phone with you, and you give us a call if you need us, or if we need you. Make sure you head back before the sun goes down, okay?"" Niamh reassures her daughter, giving her shoulders a loving squeeze.

Overcome with relief of getting what she wanted, Caitlin excitedly gets herself dressed, and being the well behaved child she was, takes the bus down the hillside and into the heart of town. Most of the Valley knew the Ashwells at least, and knew of her parents; the talented busker her mother was.

Her trip to the art gallery wasn't in itself eventful, but her curious mind was filled with so many questions and strikes of inspiration as she oogled at the bright colours; the vivid strokes each and every artist had brought to canvas. Each and every chisel mark upon the sculptures on display, each telling an equally vivid and fascinating story about its creator, stories Caitlin yearned to know with a passion. The young genius made a note to herself to visit the library, commiting some of the artists to memory to investigate later. With the sun high and bright, the Summer upon Sunset Valley, Caitlin decides she'll round off the morning with a snow cone in the Central Park. She can almost see the machine from here, just past her school, closed for the weekend.

But as she reaches the corner of the block, and waits to cross the street to the park entrance, she spots another kid charging towards her; a scrawny, blonde kid she vaguely recognised. Harvey Bunch. Lisa Bunch's son. He was close to moving into the High School, much like her sister. With fire in his eyes, the Mean Spirited, entitled boy rushes towards Caitlin, and roughly tackles her to the ground right outside the front of her school. She had not spoken to this boy, nor had ever crossed him. She lay on the ground, covering her head as the older boy laid into her, for no other reason that wanted to get into a fight for his own angry tendencies. He kicks, punches and throws the young Caitlin around. Proud of himself, he taunts her, boasting about his strength and power, before proudly trotting off across the street, leaving Caitlin bruised and battered on the corner. Little did she know it, but this would not be the end of this...

# Chapter 5: Ashwells Make Their Mark.

Dejected, injured and bruised, Caitlin struggles back to the bus, opting not to call her parents. Not because she didn't want to, but she didn't want them to stop her from going out again. It was the first time she had all by herself, and she didn't want it to be the last already.

But if she thought her mothers would notice when she came back in, she would have be mistaken. It was the very first thing they noticed when the young girl staggered back in with shoeprints all over her dress, bruises and her hair askew. Being the understanding parents they were, they were not angry in any way with their daughter, but demanded to know who'd done it. Feeling a similar, if not misguided sense of right and wrong, she didn't want to get Harvey in trouble for his vicious and unprovoked beating. Claiming she didn't know who did it, and sticking to that story, she retreated to her room in defeat.

But her sister Caoimhe's rebellious streak would be what coaxed the story out of her. She sits on the chair by her desk, hearing the entire furore through the door. She turns it around to face her beaten sister, having prepared for High School next week.  
""So, sister... do you want to tell me who did it?"" Caoimhe asks her as she enters the room, the moment the door is closed.  
""It's like I told moms. I don't know who..."" Caitlin weakly stuck to her story. But deep down, she knew her sister wasn't going to let her off the hook. Being a few years older, Caoimhe had become quite fiercely protective of her younger sibling.  
""They were from school, weren't they?"" Caoimhe talks over her, crossing her arms firmly.  
""... Yes."" Caitlin responds, running two fingers over her bruise.  
""Who?""  
""... Harvey."" Caitlin finally cracks, letting a tear run down her face.  
""Harvey BUNCH?"" Caoimhe leans forwards in anger, staring sympathically at her sister.  
""Yeah... Him.""  
""That entitled little fool in my grade? The blonde kid?"" Caoimhe clarifies further, knowing she was going to be seeing the very same guy first thing on Monday when school started.  
""Please don't say anything to moms. They'll fuss and be mad about it!"" Caitlin hushes her sister, but confirms who she means. ""But yeah, it's him.""  
""Ooooh sister, you don't worry yourself. I'll make sure he gets exactly what he deserves.""

And with Caoimhe growing up into her teenage years to be quite the athletic girl, she certainly meant it.

Caoimhe was sure to get the earlier bus to school sharp on Monday morning, with the excuse that she wanted to be extra early to make sure she got her classes and schedules sorted with plenty of time. After all, she didn't want to start failing high school but poor preparation, would she? Naturally, it was an excuse her parents bought with no questions asked; she was, after all, a very talented girl.

And that's when Caoimhe met Harvey in the park before the first day of high school.



https://preview.redd.it/mbch770kuvae1.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=8263580d9a1fa443afddfe8483c5fe223d991b36

It started with an insult. A simple call out to the isolated bully, Harvey. An insult against his maturity. His need to beat up a younger kid for his own satisfaction. Naturally, the arrogant Bunch didn't kindly to the verbal tirade. It was also quite clear he wasn't used to being confronted on his poor behaviour. Not at home, not at school, and certainly not in public. But when he opened his mouth to hurl one right back...

https://preview.redd.it/ikx6jhvuuvae1.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=2eca4933cda5feef3dba6c5be0db26dee66203cb

Caoimhe's palm is swift and brutal, landing a stinging slap across the bullies face with a venomous threat of ""Don't even try me!"" The bully is dazed and confused from the strike, but it's only seconds before his mean spirited nature and aggression over the humiliation grows. Not to mention he'd just been insulted by a girl - something his friends would never let him hear the end of. Unable to resist, he struck. Like he had done to her sister just days ago, he pounced, trying to tackle Caoimhe to the ground. Except, he found the older sibling wasn't going to cave quite as easily.

https://preview.redd.it/hy0ecs4bvvae1.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=15b9be24116ac10d077da6648d641093454d4f1b

With her superior agility and strength, she quickly got the upper hand in the brawl, landing several punishing blows against her sister's bully, overpowering him with relative ease, and beating him just as badly as he'd done to Caitlin. Throwing Harvey to the ground with a final blow, she spits, ""Don't ever lift your finger to my sister, nor me, ever again, or the next one will be worse."" And with a glare of distain, she heads into school to begin her stint in High School.

For this, Caoimhe would be grounded for several days - a punishment she deemed as fully worth it for the satisfaction of taking revenge for her little sister.

As Caoimhe continues to prove to be popular in school, she makes friends with a group of three sisters from across town; Aimee, Emma and Sophie Hammond. The irresistible redhead, the reserved, shy but sporty girl, and the aloof, studious blonde, in that order. While she wouldn't exactly call them besties, there weren't very many in school who didn't know and like Caoimhe, save for the Bunch family. She'd always be the first to help her fellow student, coach them, encourage them, or share her notes with them. She might have been the first over the finish line in every race, but she still made the honor roll every week, a fact that made Harvey green with envy.



[Caoimhe dancing with the Irresistible Aimee Hammond](https://preview.redd.it/1p0sz0nswvae1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=b11745323db32ab50235803c08969524c8d0047f)

And as Caitlin also entered school, Harvey couldn't help but try and twist the narrative that he didn't get beaten that badly, and that he didn't have a choice but let her win. It was clear to Caoimhe at least, that the blonde bully wasn't getting the message that he wasn't the top dog. But she'd done it once, and he knew he couldn't try and fight her again. 

[Caoimhe was top of the sports tables for a reason, after all.](https://preview.redd.it/wdzw1imywvae1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d096505fb0fe265bad4704a5671a87321c93560)

Harvey knew he would simply have to bide his time, and try and get revenge another way. Her sister, after all, seemed like the easier target.

Caitlin, though, despite the issues she'd had as a child with the Bunchs, had really come into herself as she'd entered high school, taking after her mum in her love of everything romantic, and the pursuit of true love. Her mother Niamh would certainly have plenty to talk about, having become a bit of a hopeless romantic herself. Though unlike her popular, sporty sister, she didn't exactly have the confidence to back it up. She wasn't surrounded on the sports field by the admiring supporters, or laughing and joking with half the class. She couldn't be shut in a room with 19 people, and be telling them what to do within half an hour. Quite the contrary. She preferred the company of her close friend, Stephanie Kissinger - ironically, the daughter of the woman her mother Niamh had been with on her early days in the Valley when she was looking for a bed to stay in.

[Stephanie \(Left\) and Caitlin \(Right\)](https://preview.redd.it/9l1oownsxvae1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fef6b4457cfe657331f6736a8c402f10f4ca131)

Her days were better spent having a sweet bit of gossip at the local Bistro, both bonding in their hate of Harvey and dreaming of starting a book club that they could convince more than a couple of sims to join. Though despite the significant disparity in social confidence, Caoimhe kept her sister close and was fiercely loyal to her, making sure she was kept safe with the Bunchs having painted a target on her back. And no matter what, Caoimhe was always going to be Caitlin's best friend when it really came down to it, being utterly inseparable.

As the Autumn term turned to Winter, Caoimhe was sick of hearing, through the grapevine in school about Harvey's gossip about her and her sister. Caoimhe can't get a boyfriend. Caitlin is a nerd. Caoimhe was repulsive. But instead of taking it to him in a brawl like she'd already proven herself capable of, she decided she was going to get back at him in a much more clever, devious way.

During the holiday break, the Hammonds were nice enough to extend an invitation to Caoimhe to come and hang out in the park and enjoy the break together with a hot chocolate in hand and a snowball in the other. With snow falling heavily on the valley the night before, Caoimhe was delighted to accept the invitation, and convinced Caitlin to come along. Their parents were very glad to have them out of the house for the day. Niamh and Amy could enjoy a quiet little date day of their own without their daughters running their active social lives at home.

https://preview.redd.it/b927um2t0wae1.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=c55c0737ca8563fd0bedfa4d64670f17a28d3bdb

It was the first time the sisters could really forget about school. Caitlin could finally put down her books that even a college student would get tired reading. She could put the pages and pages of notes away in her desk in the cramped room their shared, and could truly stop worrying about her grades for the first time. She had no reason to worry in the first place, having made the honor roll in her first term, much like her sister. Not to mention her membership to the photography club. But it was a rare moment of true escapism as she exchanged snowballs across the proverbial no-man's land against Aimee and her sister. Her and Emma proved to be quite the duo, splatting several across their opponents faces.

And with a flying snowball flying towards Emma, Caitlin dives to her right to tackle her out of the way. In that brief moment the two land heavily in the snow, Caitlin senses that there might be... more to it... than just simply being her friend. Their eyes meet, and the two feel a sense of electric. Their joyous laughter dies down into an awkward pause as they smile at each other, before being forced up by a ""Come on Ems, are you two building a cannon under there!?"" from Emma's sister Aimee.

A precious moment experienced, and a precious moment to fuel their young minds.

With the group in an extra mischevious mood, Caoimhe has a rather... devious idea. They know where the Bunchs live. They know Harvey is going to be at home. Granted, he wouldn't open the door and roll out the red carpet, but they didn't mean they couldn't get one up the scoreboard. And thus, she uses her charm and charisma to convince the group to pay the house a visit. In their bags, a few cartons of the best eggs from the local market.

Caitlin, having been used to being the good and perfect student and perfect sister, was strikingly happy to be dipping her toe into the pool of rebellion. And who better to show her than her older sister? A chance to even the score against Harvey by her own would be a welcome holiday present. So, through the cold and snow covered town, the group make their way out of the park, and up the hill. They jest about hoping he's got a window open, and joke about landing one right on his bed or his bedroom wall. They even kid about hitting his girlfriend with an egg, though they all knew he'd made up that partnership. Or so they thought. In fairness, the Hammond's didn't really have anything again Harvey, but the thrill of breaking the rules was too much when it was Caoimhe sowing the seed. The silver tongued Ashwell sister could convince people of just about anything.

https://preview.redd.it/s6bma14t2wae1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6d2a63522270388fdc584072b24ffe0bd3fc66c

And that's exactly what they do. Caoimhe happily launches the first egg, seeing its shell break across the upstairs bedroom window of the Bunch's fancy house. Aimee gleefully launches a second and third, with Emma right behind, splatting across the living room windows with a satisfying crack. The freezing temperatures would make sure those were extremely difficult to scrape off. The thought of Harvey and the Bunchs needing a chisel to clean it off the brickwork was ever so satisfying.

Caitlin, at first, gingerly, takes an egg from the carton, turning it over in her hand. With a quick shout of encouragement from Caoimhe, she too clenches her teeth aggressively, and hurls it. Watching it explode, splashing white and yellow down the front door makes her feel giddy with a forbidden excitement. She could definitely get used to this.

The hits rain across the windows. An angry Lisa pulls the curtains to look out. A curious Ethan looks through the blinds. And a raging Harvey steps outside the front door, with Caoimhe throwing the last egg. With a victory aim that could not be understated, the egg squarely hits Harvey between the eyes. Freezing egg and semi liquid yolk blasts across his face, splattering down his jacket and face. With a roar of triumph and glee, the two sets of sisters sprint away through the cold, hurling triumphant insults into the air as they run, having to dart down an alleyway to avoid the responding police car.

It would be an act of mischief that made the holidays the perfect escapism for the pair.

Despite having called Sunset Valley's finest, the police never came to the Ashwell's house. Whether or not they either believed Harvey and the Bunchs, or perhaps thought they deserved it, would be a mystery.

But their mischief wouldn't go without consequences, as Lisa, Jack and Judy were quick to get in contact with Niamh and Amy, having know they for such a long time. It started as cold messages about getting their ""little terror of a daughter"" in line for her antics against them, to flat out insulting the family through text messaging. And while Niamh and Amy were quick to punish their daughters bad behaviour, nothing was ever good enough in their eyes. Deep down, Niamh and Amy knew the family were awful, and likely deserved every bit of torment Caitlin and Caoimhe were causing. But that didn't mean they condoned it.

The egging incident would prove to be a bit of a turning point for Caitlin however. And that's not just because she'd discovered a propensity for breaking the rules from time to time. But it had given her a taste of what chemistry between two sims could be. And that night, as she lay awake in bed, watching her sister fast asleep opposite, she started to think of all the ways she could explore it.

For Caitlin, it was time to prove she could break the rules all on her own. And with a resigned sigh, she takes her phone from the bedside table, and scrolls down to Emma's number.

""Hey, you awake?"" She sends, immediately realising what a silly question it was. It was only 10pm, after all. Though she was well aware of curfew approaching.  
""Yeah of course, what's up? Bet Harvey's still fumingg!"" Emma returns.  
""I bet."" Caitlin quickly texts back, and then immediately into another message. ""Say, don't suppose you want to keep up the fun streak? Fancy hitting the grind club on the hill?""  
Was she aware this would be a bad idea? Yes. Would it make what she had in mind even better? Also yes.  
""I mean, I can literally see it from my house, so hell yeah. Let's not be too long though.""

And with that, Caitlin soundlessly dressed to party, and headed out into the cold night for some rule breaking of her own.

It would prove to be a night where she explored that chemistry. In the smoke and atmosphere of the former warehouse-turned-dance club of a hall, she and Emma could hide from the impending onslaught of Curfew. She could be herself, dancing face to face, and arguably a bit too close to the girl she had felt that chemistry for in the snow earlier. And with a few of the bartenders cheeky romance drinks, it wasn't long before that ""too close dancing"", and the dutch courage of a romance drink gave her enough of a confidence to kiss Emma. Her first kiss, passionate and heated in a show of confidence even Caoimhe would have been proud of. It would be a night the two would never forget, though a night they could never remember.

Nobody knew they had slipped out after curfew to do it, and nobody saw them slip back home either. An illicit night which saw romance and... possibly love, blossom under a cold moon.

  
Though even if Caoimhe did find out, she had bigger fish to fry. She'd already made friends with most of school, and the Hammond sisters were proving to be good allies, even if Sophie was a bit elusive at times. But where Caoimhe was, the gossip very quickly followed. Doing the rounds was another rumour going around, and one that would turn out to be true.

Harvey Bunch had gotten himself a girlfriend, and was going to be taking her to the prom next week.

Oh, now this would prove to be a juicy nail in the coffin, and possibly the last one before reaching adulthood. Caoimhe began asking around. Students. Teachers, friends - anyone she could find. Anyone whom she could wriggle the information from.

Who was that blonde bully taking to prom?

It turns out the answer was much closer to home that she expected. You see, despite laughing about the family, his attitude and insulting his looks, Harvey's girlfriend was... Aimee Hammond. The irresistible redhead. In her head, Caoimhe thought it a betrayal. Her close friend, fraternising with the enemy. A close friend who swore they thought Harvey looked like a badly formed toad, suddenly having given him a chance, and worse yet, going to prom with him. She could get angry. She could get mad, like she did when she gave him a good hiding outside school that morning. But no, she was cleverer than that. Far cleverer than she was at the start of High School. She decided her best course of action was getting closer to Aimee. Much closer.

https://preview.redd.it/xrgljh5j7wae1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d42d22be07bbae01005bc7a296a6418f43f9cb2

Acting like she didn't know, she got much closer to Aimee. The group hangouts with the Hammonds become quiet, one to one meetups at her house with dinner or a pizza order. Just why did Aimee choose him?

Well, surprisingly, he was the only one who'd asked her. Maybe, just maybe, the rest of her peers through her unapproachable, being so irresistible. Or maybe it was Aimee's chronic avoidance of commitment. She wouldn't exactly be dating someone for long, opting to try it with someone new. Often unsuccessful, due to her sheer clumsiness.

So Caoimhe got to work. Jokes being on Harvey, she had no interest towards the male sims at her High School, but she certainly had a healthy interest in her female peers. Female peers like Aimee. She started to bring her conversations with Aimee into a flirty nature. After all... why would she go to prom with Harvey... when the most popular girl in school would seem happy to take her instead? All she had to do was convince her to try.

It was difficult. Aimee's interests, after all, seemed to fall solely on the male sims around her. But popularity, strength and the confidence in Caoimhe was a pretty powerful aphrodisiac. A flirty hint, a drip, drip of poison in the ear. ""C'mon, you can do way better than that."" were enough to chip away at the irresistible Amy's facade. A ""I simply can't!"" became a ""But what will he think, how will I explain that?"". A question Caoimhe could answer with a simple vow that she'd beaten him once before, she could beat him again. And besides... just imagine how cool she'll look with the soccer captain. Then a ""how will he react?"" became a ""Oh, that sounds pretty intriguing...""

Caoimhe had one thing in mind, as devious as it was. In her head, she might have a strong interest in girls, but she didn't really have an interest in her. She, in Caoimhe's mind, was a means to an end. A conduit to getting her ultimate revenge for her and for her sister. When he was left without a date, and the ""hot date"" he had lined up being on the arm of the girl he despised with every bone in his body, just in time for everyone to go their separate ways. Cruel? Yes. But tasty? Equally so.

And that's exactly what she got.

Prom night would prove to be the perfect way to end High School for Caoimhe, and the term for Caitlin. Caoimhe hadn't even told her sister who she was bringing to the prom. So when she arrived, arm in arm with Aimee Hammond of all girls, both her jaw dropped, Harvey's, and the rest of the school. Not a hint of a partner all throughout High School, and suddenly she arrives with her?

But sweetest of all, the older sister managed to score herself not only Harvey's date, but Prom queen as well, with both Aimee and Caoimhe dancing front and centre, making out and confessing their love to each other - arguably after a romance drink too many. It was the sheer romantic magnitude of the night what made Caoimhe wonder... ""What is Aimee actually IS for me?"" - What if this redhead bombshell that everyone else goes for actually is the one I should be with? Possibly... But a bad idea nonetheless. Aimee, after all, couldn't even commit to a deadline, let alone a girlfriend.

Caitlin too marvelled in the humiliation of watching her former bully running away from the prom with his tail between his legs, like he'd done every time he'd tangled with the Ashwell sisters. While she wouldn't win prom queen, she too had her own deep connection.

Her date, after all, was Emma Hammond, Aimee's reserved sister. And the two of them needed no such romance drinks to make the very same confessions.

In some circles, it'd almost be poetic, two sets of sisters, dating another set of sisters. A stolen partner, getting with the prom queen, sneaking out after dark. Two polar opposite siblings, fiercely loyal to the other, having each other's backs throughout their high school. But with their terms coming to a close, it wouldn't be long before Caoimhe had her eye on something else: University. Granted, Caitlin wouldn't be far behind her. If Caoimhe thought her adventures in High School were risky and wild, those that would await her without anxious parents to chastise her would be something else...

  
Though even if they wanted to, their power over their daughters was slipping now, with both of them now in their old age. The ever so loving Niamh and Amy, despite their nurturing touch on their daughters, knew they were getting on a bit. It didn't much slow them down, but they knew their daughters would be finding their independence arguably sooner than they had hoped...

However, I can see how some might disagree. Perhaps ""chai tea"" is simply a more common and established phrase, making it easier for people to understand.

She joined our office a few months ago (it's a different team but we work together on projects from time to time). Until recent weeks, we got on pretty well. We also sometimes got to chat during lunch breaks.

It really felt like she was also interested and I was starting to think about making a move. But then a weird/awkward thing happened at our Christmas party in early December. One of our colleagues (who's always a bit tipsy at these kind of events) made a joke about me sleeping with all the girls in town a few years ago, and only stopping because there was nobody left to sleep with. This was a reference to the period after my break up with my girlfriend at that time, when I had several one night stands. This was more than a couple of years ago. Most people were laughing at this and moved on to a different conversation, but I noticed she looked somewhat surprised by this and certainly wasn't laughing.

In the days following this party, her attitude has changed. Before, we'd chat casually when grabbing coffee from the café downstairs, for example. Nowadays she's always got to rush. 

I'm kind of frustrated in a way at being judged for something that happened in the past. And I'm feeling a bit low about it obviously.

From what I have gathered, she does have some conservative views, and maybe that's why she's being like his.

I'm too nervous to make a move now, because things might just become weirder, but also, I feel like maybe I should give it some time and things might change again. Thoughts? ",1,1735960464.0,AskMenAdvice,4,1.0,False

1ht4y5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ht4y5j/what_happened_to_the_bad_boy_you_dated/,"What happened to the ""bad boy"" you dated? ","I think many women (especially younger ones, in my opinion) have gone through that phase where they dated a man who fit the stereotype of the bad boy—the one who gets into trouble and you're not supposed to be involved with. This question is for those of you who’ve been in relationships with these kinds of men: do you know what became of him?

Personally, I went through this phase at 19, at the beginning of my career as a classical ballet dancer. I was living alone in Paris (I'm french), and I think I craved excitement and novelty. Classical dance is an art that demands rigor and discipline, so outwardly, I was the cliché of the well-behaved girl. But I had gone through a rough adolescence, wanting to break free from that image, so I did some foolish things (teenage foolishness, of course). I think my dance teachers still remember that rebellious phase of my life, haha.

For the first time, I landed an important role in a performance—Carmen. I had so much fun interpreting that ballet, and I think it showed. Afterward, a young man who knew some of my colleagues asked who I was because my performance had impressed him, and he wanted to know more about me. His name was Roméo, and he was an actor. He was the stereotypical Parisian bourgeois but incredibly handsome (and very hot haha). Very quickly, I discovered he was into a lot of wild stuff and had no boundaries. My friends said I was crazy back then, but he took it to another level. Initially, we didn’t want a serious relationship, but over time, as we spent more time together and talked, we fell in love.

I knew he was not someone I could introduce to my mother. I come from a traditional Catholic family, and he had tattoos, loved motorcycles, and behaved in ways that didn’t align with my family’s values. We got into all kinds of trouble together, and I found it amusing and entertaining. We would have coffee and run off without paying, sneak into places at night where we weren’t allowed, shoplift, and even took a weekend trip to Amsterdam, where we did a lot of drugs. As we got closer, we opened up about our childhoods (things we hadn’t shared with anyone else). His father had been cheating on his mother for years with prostitutes, and I grew up in a family without a father and with an abusive mother. I think he acted out to escape the pressures of his social class and to forget the pain of his childhood. Despite his tough exterior, he could be touching and sensitive with me. Sometimes he’d pick flowers for me. He was also my biggest supporter: he came to all my performances and always clapped the loudest—sometimes even hyping up the audience when they were too shy. 

We loved each other so much. Our relationship was intense. But the wounds from the past kept us from saying ""I love you,"" so we expressed it through actions or by pretending the opposite. I often told him, ""You know, you're stupid,"" or ""Hey, I don't love you, okay?"" and he knew exactly what that meant. We were the same, him and me. I wished I could stop time.

But one day, just before I was supposed to perform in a musical adaptation of Romeo and Juliet (ironic, isn’t it?), he got arrested. I found out he was involved in a horrific case of gang rape. I also learned that he had had a girlfriend throughout our entire relationship. I was horrified. I think I cried for three weeks straight. He swore to me it was all false and that he had nothing to do with it, but I chose to believe the women.

The trial eventually took place, and he was acquitted, mainly due to a lack or evidence. This left me with a mix of emotions — part relief, but also a sense of injustice, as I would never truly know the truth of what had happened. After the verdict, I never saw him again. 

For months, I lost all joy in life, but eventually, I moved on because I had to keep living. Today, I mostly think of the good memories, but for a long time, I resented him deeply.

As I got home I made coffee and all of a sudden my place lost power. It was pitch black, I couldn’t see anything and I got really tired so decided to take a 20min nap before going back to work. As I fall asleep in my dream now entering a second dream, I felt something pulling my leg but I was to tired to wake up until it pulled me violently and I woke up inside my first dream in fears. Still no power all I could see was this transparent human form shadow at the edge of my bed. I got so terrified I took my phone to use the flash light but it wouldn’t work. I tried reciting Ayatul Kursi but I could not pronounce the words. I started panicking and that entity started chocking me and I started running around my apartment, the door was locked I couldn’t get out. My cats were crawling hiding and I didn’t know what to do. The entity pushed me so hard my whole body slammed against the window. I kept on trying to recite but no words would come out even tho I could scream and cry regular vocabulary. I ran back to the front door and it opened, my cat got out and I panicked trying to close the door and lock it in fear my other cats would get out. The entity kept blocking the door and pulling it back open, until I realized I was dreaming. He’s true form appeared and he was human. Early 20’s and I kicked down the door and started screaming at him in rage. I asked why are you doing this to me and who are you repeatedly and he said you can see me? I got even more mad and he started crying. He told me someone sent him to scare me and i was confused why. When I asked why can’t I recite Ayatul Kursi he said the person blocked you from waking up and I got so confused. I then calmed down and proceeded asking him his name as he started crying. He told me his name and said he died from drug overdose, that he’s been stuck here, he just wants to die and tried killing himself but can’t as he is already dead. He also said he missed his family. I was in shock and I told him I was still alive and I could contact his family and he cried even more. He even apologized from terrifying me and then I got pushed out of my own dream and woke up. 
When I googled his name I found him. He died from fentanyl overdose in 2018. I’m in complete shock right now trying to understand what just happened as I never had dreams like this, mostly multiple dreams in one. On top of talking to a dead person? Who is real in our reality?

Imagine your brain is a crowded room. There's a constant buzz of chatter, papers flying everywhere, and people coming in and out, demanding your attention. Now, imagine finding a corner of that room where everything goes quiet. That corner is what I like to call ""headspace."" It’s a moment of clarity in the whirlwind of life—a pause that lets you breathe, think, and just *be.*  

But let’s not romanticize this too quickly. Headspace isn’t some magical realm that appears whenever you snap your fingers. It’s more like a muscle you strengthen with intention and practice. It’s also deeply personal, varying from person to person. For some, it might mean meditating in a sunlit room. For others, it’s the quiet moments of a morning coffee or the rhythmic stride of a walk in nature. Whatever your version is, cultivating headspace can be transformative.  

### The Noise We Carry  

Let’s be honest—modern life is noisy. From the ping of notifications to the endless demands of work and family, our brains rarely get a break. We’re constantly processing, analyzing, and reacting. It’s exhausting, isn’t it? For me, it hit hardest one weekend when I realized I’d spent more time scrolling on my phone than actually talking to the people around me. My head felt like a cluttered attic, packed with old worries, to-do lists, and random bits of information. That’s when I knew I needed headspace.  

The first step, as I discovered, was acknowledging the noise. It’s easy to drown in busyness and convince ourselves it’s normal. But here’s the thing: just like a cluttered room feels stifling, a cluttered mind can weigh you down in ways you don’t even realize.  

### Carving Out Your Corner  

Finding headspace isn’t about silencing the world—it’s about managing how much of it you let in. Think of it like filtering water. You can’t stop the flow, but you can control what passes through.  

For me, mindfulness meditation became my filter. The first time I tried it, I felt ridiculous. Sitting there, focusing on my breath while my brain yelled, *“This is boring! You’ve got emails to answer!”* wasn’t exactly relaxing. But over time, I learned that the point wasn’t to stop my thoughts; it was to notice them without judgment.  

Take this example: imagine sitting by a stream, watching leaves float by. Each leaf is a thought. You don’t chase it or grab it; you just let it pass. That’s the essence of mindfulness, and it’s one of the most effective tools for creating headspace.  

### The Ripple Effect  

The beauty of headspace is that it doesn’t just stay in your head. It ripples into every part of your life. When I started prioritizing it, I noticed I was less reactive. I didn’t snap at my family when I was stressed, and I could approach challenges at work with a clearer mind.  

Here’s an example: I once had a colleague who thrived on drama. Every meeting was a battlefield, and it was draining to be around. Before cultivating headspace, I’d get sucked into her energy, leaving the room frustrated and frazzled. But once I learned to ground myself, I could step back and see her behavior for what it was—her issue, not mine. Instead of reacting, I responded with calmness.  

And it’s not just interpersonal. Headspace helps you connect with yourself. It gives you room to ask, *“What do I need right now?”* Whether it’s rest, movement, or creativity, listening to yourself becomes easier when your mind isn’t cluttered with noise.  

### Technology: Friend or Foe?  

Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: technology. Our phones and laptops are often the biggest culprits in robbing us of headspace. But they’re not inherently bad—it’s all about how we use them.  

For instance, I once downloaded a mindfulness app to help guide my meditation practice. At first, it felt ironic to use a screen to escape screens, but it turned out to be a game-changer. Apps like these can act as training wheels, helping you build the habit of mindfulness until you can do it on your own. On the flip side, mindless scrolling on social media is the quickest way to clutter your mental attic.  

### Embracing the Mess  

Here’s the kicker: headspace doesn’t mean having a perfectly organized mind. Life is messy, and so are we. There will always be days when your brain feels like a tangled ball of yarn. And that’s okay.  

The goal isn’t perfection; it’s balance. It’s about giving yourself grace on the chaotic days and celebrating the calm ones. For me, headspace became a reminder that I don’t have to solve every problem or control every situation. Sometimes, it’s enough to just be present.  

### Practical Ways to Find Headspace  

Let’s get practical for a moment. Here are a few simple ways to create headspace in your life:  

1. **Start small**: Dedicate just five minutes a day to sitting quietly or focusing on your breath. You’d be amazed at how powerful those minutes can be.  

2. **Create boundaries**: Set specific times to unplug from technology. Even an hour without screens can feel like a mini-vacation for your mind.  

3. **Move your body**: Exercise isn’t just for physical health—it’s a fantastic way to clear your head. Whether it’s yoga, running, or dancing in your living room, find what works for you.  

4. **Journal it out**: Writing down your thoughts can help declutter your mind and bring clarity to your emotions.  

5. **Find your flow**: Engage in activities that absorb your attention completely, like painting, cooking, or gardening. These moments of flow are natural headspace creators.  

### The Bigger Picture  

At its core, headspace isn’t just about individual peace—it’s about creating a ripple effect in the world around you. When we’re more grounded, we’re kinder, more patient, and better equipped to handle life’s challenges. In a world that often feels chaotic, finding headspace is a small but powerful act of resistance.  

So, whether you’re meditating, walking in the woods, or simply taking a deep breath before a tough conversation, know this: you’re not just making space for yourself. You’re making space for a better version of you—and by extension, a better world.  

Now, tell me—what’s your version of headspace?

I've been in therapy more or less continuously for the last eight years, but I feel like I keep running into a wall, and I'm hoping this community might have some insight. 

I'm autistic, and I would say taht I'm fairly low support needs and do well in my client work (I work in social services) I've always struggled hard with building and maintaining personal relationships. I mask to a degree, but in general I think Im bad at it. I can do superficial pleasantries where needed, but I'm bad at sustained small talk, and I can't control my facial expressions like others can. I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve. 

It feels like a pattern I can't break. The advice I get from therapists usually seems to boil down to ""ask someone out for coffee"", ""keep trying"", but these things don't seem to work for me like they're supposed to. I would describe myself as fairly self-aware. I just feel like I'm so bad with people, trying to get along with colleagues, join groups, all that feels like an uphill battle. I guess I feel like I struggle a lot with the superficial niceties of socializing, but I can't really make progress with people to take things a bit deeper. My most recent therapist is convinced that people like me, but (and I think this will sound weird) there's something that just doesn't work about my relationships with others. I guess I get the sense that there are social expectations that I can't quite meet, as hard as I try. Either I'm not being social enough (my colleagues tell me that I don't like being social, which isn't true -- I just like to be social in a very particular way), or others seem very anxious when I interact with them, or my conversations are just full of awkwardness (in the sense that they don't flow the right way).

I have failed relationships and friendships. And I am most likely neurodiverse. Think maybe even well masking autistic. I ruin a lot of things with my emotions and lack of social understanding.
I've tried to get diagnosed but as an adult woman who manages eye contact and knows a lot of sayings (haha) the doctors never believe me

I had a good relation with another neurodiverse person but it was partly due to us smoking green and relaxing. He tried a lot but when I developed psychosis things got out of hand and we broke up.

Green was my one escape from being different, my feel good escapism. I have never felt such calmness. But after a traumatic psychosis I can't risk it anymore and it's missing deeply. That and my trusted person.

I have always had an addictive personality. Smoking cigs, drinking coffee, then smoking you know what, know it's alcohol.

I had to move back home to my unhealthy and messy environment. And I seek to escape as long as I can't live on my own. I tried modern medicine but even that I would abuse if I could and I don't want to be stable, I want bliss always. 
If I could go back to green I would but it's too much of a risk for me.

I spend most days on my own. I don't drink a lot, just enough to get a buzz and feel good about things. I tried to go days work it but I always yearn for it.

# Buffs

* Sage sage: When played: If you made atleast 4☀, draw a card. (6 sun this turn? Seriously? Atleast bump it down to 4 to keep the gimmick)
* Grave Mistake: Reveal a Gravestone. Draw a card. (You could potentially use this to play an exact counter to gravestones, and bouncing a grave just means the opponent will play it again)
* Cattail: Amphibious Evolution: This gets +2 strength. (Good for consistency, good for Cattail. Maybe this will see more use in amphibious decks?)
* Heroic Health: Heal your Hero for 6. Draw a card. (Good tempo)
* Goatify: Transform a Zombie with the highest strength into a Goat. Draw a card. (Sorry I made this hero even more annoying than she already is... also, ditto)
* Genetic Amplification: Conjure a non-basic Plant that costs 1☀️. It gets +2/+1, Amphibious, and Team-Up. It costs 1☀️ less. Draw a card. (Giving a bad super some love! Also, all the non-basic 1 costs are very good, the worst ones are Potato Mine and Sting Bean, and the best ones are Clique Peas and arguably Poison Mushroom.)
* Gardening Gloves: Move a Plant. Draw a card. (duh)
* Chomper: 3/2. When played: Destroy a Zombie here with 4🟢 or less. (Consistent, cool reference, AND balanced? Every fanmade card maker's dream.)
* Ra Zombie: 3/5. (Hearty cards have hearty health. Simple.)
* Cakesplosion: Deal 4 damage. (Why not? Now it's more worth the cost)
* Captain Flameface: Gravestone. All Pirates get Strikethrough. (We can let pirates have a little strikethrough without getting Sizzled. As a treat)
* Whipvine: 3/2. 2 cost. When played: Move a Zombie. (Turn 5 is a little late for control, dont'cha think?)
* Bean Counter: 2/2. Team-Up. When you play a Bean, all Beans get +1/+1. When played: Conjure two Weenie Beanies. They both cost 1☀️ less. (It's a lot, but it was necessary, no one uses this card in any scenario)
* Disco-Naut: Bullseye. Zombies with 2🟢 or less have Bullseye. (Just a little bit better now)
* Mountain Climber: 4/3. (If you can only play this viably on one lane, let's make it count!)
* Cro-Magnolia: Team-Up. When played: Plants here and next door get +2🟢. (Why was this ever an evolution? Just makes the plant side lopsided)
* Bamboozle: 2/1. 2 cost. Plant Evolution: Draw two cards. (turn 6 is too late for card draw, this fixes Bamboozle's fundamental problem)
* Jugger-Nut: Armored 1, Untrickable, Bullseye (you can still definitely destroy it, just a bit more high fidelity than using two bungees or a rolling stone)
* Blockbuster: When played: Destroy a Gravestone here. Plant Evolution: Instead, destroy all Gravestones here and next door. (this? this creature did not deserve bullseye. but I gave it something as compensation!)
* Killer Whale: 2/2. Amphibious. Fusion: A Zombie played on this gets +2/+2 and Amphibious.
* Cosmic Pea: 2/2. 3 cost. When played: This does a Bonus Attack. When played: Conjure a Pea. It gets the ability ""When played: This does a Bonus Attack"". (:eyes:)
* Bluesberry: 3 cost. (Why was this ever 5 cost...?)
* Melon-Pult: When played on Heights: This gets +2🟢. (yeah uncreative, whatevs)
* Sapfling: 5 cost. (Everyone and their mother has suggested it. Has YOUR mother suggested it? Go ask her sometime.)
* Sun-Shroom: 1 cost. (Good ending)
* Spikeweed Sector: 2 cost. (We need more viable plant environments!)
* Coffee Grounds: 3 cost. When a plant is played here, it does a Bonus Attack. (Why yes, I am systematically replacing Double Strike because it is largely useless as a mechanic. How did you know? Also, ditto from last reasoning)

# Nerfs

* Rodeo Gargantuar: 5/9. (9 is too special of a number! ... Whaddya mean that's a dumb reason?)
* All-Star Zombie: 4/5. (This is ANNOYING, but removing Untrickable would make it useless, so good middle ground)
* Stupidfckin Con Man: 1/2. (Useless card > annoying and meta controlling card)
* Quarterly Bonus: Conjure a Professional card, and it costs 2🟣 less. (Who asked for more bonus attack cards, period?)
* Sizzle: 4 cost. (3 is too much, 5 too little. This is a nice middle ground)
* Healthy Treat: 2 cost. (1 cost is just a bit too much for my tastes)

# Nothingburgers

* Kernel-Pult: Team-Up. When played on Heights: A Zombie gets -1/-1. (Removed ""the"" for consistency)
* Lily of the Valley: When you play a plant on Heights, that Plant gets +2/+2. (Ditto)
* Wannabe Hero: Frenzy. When played: Heal 3. This gets +1 for each Health your Hero has. (Added proper punctuation and spelling)
* ~~Ensign Uproot~~: -> Lieutenant Uproot (No one even knows what Ensign means besides people in the war. It's fine)
* ~~Night cap~~: -> Nightcap. (This will never not trigger me)
* Gargantuar Mime: When a non-Mime Plant or Zombie does a Bonus Attack, this does a Bonus Attack. (removed false info about Untrtickable)

I saw some specks of light, googled it, then saw more and it fueled my anxiety to the max and after that alot of weird things happened... then the dots stopped, i somewhat dealt with the fear of going blind (or deaf, or both at once). I later realized those sparkles of light were corrolated with higher stress(which of course at first was fueling itself). I read up on how people deal with going blind, soothed my anxiety some, the sparks went down over the months afterwards. 

But the weird stuff kept happening, had a bunch of weird ideas, lost of paranoia mostly around familly members and some around my college having people keep track of me on campus, and other stuff. 

Had a few moments where I read something, or did something, only to find out i never actually did what i had clear memories of and I managed to read an email that never existed (and bring it up to someone). 

My brain was wonky and, for some periods of time, i compartmentalized my own thoughts as being from spiritual things(honestly worried i was hearing voices cause the only way i could tell it apart from someone speaking was that it sounded off.) Right now I'm slowly (successfully) pulling my brain back to ""hey those are things you are thinking about, see it makes sense that yould think that and its not something spiritual"". (this came and went a couple times). 

I quit coffee, but my reaction to coffee was weirdly varied. Coffee would, at times, make me elated, other times it would make me feel sad and gloomy about my life. (id also have periods where everything weird almost completely stopped, at some points i realized it was really really weird, and i just felt really happy then). then everything cycled back. It felt like someone was starting a stopwatch and resetting it after a certain point, but sometimes it just kept going for way too long,. Right now I feel fine without caffine. (still drinking tea). 

Not that I quit coffee I'm doing better but the random full on anxiety and occasional intrusive thought is back(like before, i had intrusive thoughts before in the form of imagining something painful or doing something dangerous usually).

He seems irritated with me all day but then gets into bed rolls over to me with “ohh baby”.  Initially I would go along with it but eventually having sex with someone who seems to dislike me made me feel lower than a prostitute…at least they get something out of it. I earn a lot more money than him and have more assets and we have a prenup and I think a lot of his anger stems from that. I have repeatedly told him that for a woman to want sex she wants to feel loved and that can be through small actions throughout the day like asking if you want a coffee when they are making themselves one through to kissing hello/ goodbye and asking how your day went. In November he was nice to me for two whole days and my world felt transformed. But he couldn’t stick with it and now I have told him I want to separate.,10,1735959265.0,DeadBedrooms,6,0.69,False

1ht4lzb,https://i.redd.it/sbq3t3516wae1.jpeg,A couple of coffee place recommendations for the nerds,"Paris has a rep for bad coffee (by the standards of American enthusiasts), but there certainly are places that are as good as it gets. 

Télescope in the 1st Arr. has a nice menu of filter/Aeropress options. Most are between 8 and 12 euro per cup, but probably fairly reflect the cost of the beans and the shop labor. The owners/employees are happy to chat and nerd out about the coffee. I’d say this place is the equal of any of the best shops in the world. 


Le Grain Churchill, around the corner from the Moulin Rouge is also a great shop. Owner roasts beans from Rwanda on site, and is happy to chat shop.  Great omelette too :)

After a few days here, I’d conclude the high end scene is not as well developed as it is in the US, but what *is* here is truly excellent.  (And the odds of getting great coffee in the US without prior research are also pretty low)

I had applied through coolworks for the winter season as a barista, the gift shop/coffee shop are run by a married couple, Lora and Serghei. In the interview, Lora was kind, charismatic and had expressed if I didn’t have the $600 housing deposit required before move in, they would take it out of my first paycheck. I didn’t have it at the time and really wanted this job so I was thrilled, and promptly booked my flight. When I got there, they seemed confused that I didn’t have the money, and said they’d make a “special exception” for me. I noticed that they liked to repeat themselves. A lot. No guests, keep the house clean, don’t bring in any drama. They told me this at least five times a day for the first week I was there. 
They also, had a camera in front of the house, and four cameras in the store. Every.Single.Time that I would so much as give the wrong straw out for a drink, I would get an insulting text from one of the owners, who seemed to do nothing but watch the cameras all day, every day, for the 70 hour weeks I was working without a single break. They sent me paragraph after paragraph about how I overcharged a regular I had never met, how the waffles I made “didn’t look like the pictures” how I was so forgetful, didn’t pay attention, and how they they don’t “play” about their business. They did this to the girls working the giftshop as well. It was such a constant, suffocating, violation of our privacy to the point where I felt like I literally had someone waiting behind me to strike at any moment, no matter where I went. 

(Mind you, this woman was 9 months pregnant, training me and forcefully grabbing my arms when I “poured milk wrong” claiming they opened their business for fun, a month before they were going to have a baby. So believe that if you will.) 

They said if I needed a day off I could ask, they didn’t need to be open, so I did. I got told no. I got told no when I expressed I was literally going to pass out on the floor. It got to the point where I was begging for time off, I was exhausted, anxiety ridden, and ready to quit. So I called off. They texted me that they saw me leave the house the night prior through the cameras, and if I didn’t have a doctor’s note (for a panic attack??) or didn’t show up, I’d be fired and have 24 hours to leave the house. 

I got the note, and the doctor actually told me I wasn’t the first person that season who had come to her with a similar story, so maybe a lot of the shops around that town have new, abusive owners. I was planning to leave once I had my last check. However, the last girl who was working the giftshop had put in her notice that morning, and I got a call from them saying that because they couldn’t keep both shops open, I was effectively fired, and had 24 hours to vacate the house. To which I replied they owed me my deposit back, so I could actually leave. They gave me $200 out of the $600 they took from my last paycheck, because, “the bathroom and kitchen were dirty, and the vacuum hadn’t been emptied.”

Ive been having some major confusion over what this girl thinks of me and need some exterior perspectives. So for context: Just turned 18, about a month ago i saw this gorgeous girl at a bar and had to ask for her socials, which to my suprise she gave me. I then texted her a bit and she wasnt dry at all but wasnt keepin the convo going. At this point my plan was to not text her and just ask her out when I finished my exams. About a week later she actually asked me out which suprised me and we went on the first date which i organised cause she fell sick a bit. It was the first date ive ever been on but luckily it went pretty well, i picked her up in my car, brought her to thr city for coffee, wasnt awkward and she had a great personality, exactly my type. This is where the main issue became noticeable. The issue thats had me on the fence is that shes never texted me, ever. Aside from asking me out, and even after multiple conversations ive started she has never texted me first. Again, like i said before, when i do start a convo shes never dry, replies fast and talks but if i dont start a convo she never will. So then i thought ok maybe she wasnt interested but when i asked her out for the second date she said yes. Today was the 2nd date and again, it went great,  took her out to a nice resto which she rlly liked, tried complimenting her more this time and she said some nice things abt me to. But just like before, after the date nothing, no text or anytning. I had to text her the basic old ""i had a good time etc..."" She told me after i asked her that shed lmk when shes free but i have a deep down feeling she wont. So, basically my question is, seeing how shes also down to hangout and seems interested but that she never texts me, what does this mean. ",2,1735958693.0,Crushes,3,1.0,False

I wish I could say that I don’t care if you guys read this, but deep down I want you to read this because I want you to know how pathetic you guys are, but I shouldn’t want that because I’m tired of feeling like I have to prove that you guys are wrong. I shouldn’t have to live my life trying to shove proof of things to people when at the end of the day I shouldn’t give a fuck what you guys think. So frankly, I don’t care if you guys ever read this, because I swear that from this day none of you get a word from me. You all stopped being my family because you chose to be horrible people.
Lets start with my uncle. 
You were never supposed to be here in my home in the first place. After my mother worked her ass off and spent so much money to get your ass into the country, what do you do in return for her? You spend all your days proving how worthless you are. You refused to get a job for months and months living completely free here in my mothers home and spent all your days playing shitty games on your phone and gambling away all the money you milked off my grandmother. Shit, the only times you even bothered to try to fill out a job application you didn’t even do it yourself, you sat me down and told me to fill out all of them for you. Im not even an adult yet and still im sitting here doing everything you should be? Do you even know the words that come out of your mouth after you spend the entire night drinking off countless bottles of beer? You sit here and yell at my mother, your own sister, telling her she’s worthless, calling her hundreds of things I cant even repeat, when you cant even walk properly from drinking all the alcohol that you didn’t pay for. You say she’s worthless, but do you realize that everyday when you wake up and drink your morning cup of coffee, youre drinking coffee, that you didn’t pay for, milk, that you also didn’t pay for, and from a cup, which you didn’t spend a cent on. Or to make it better, youre doing all this while sitting under the roof that you don’t contribute shit to. Actually you probably dont even notice any of this because its not like you even make your own coffee, youre a 36 year old man and have your mommy make your coffee and breakfast and do your dishes and wash and fold your clothes. To my stupid fucking aunts who defend this deadbeat, do you know how many nights I stay up until the early morning because this man is outside blasting music and smashing alcohol bottles on the road for hours past midnight. You guys dont even have the right to say anything because you aren’t the ones living through it. You just sit from afar and state your useless opinion and say “aw but poor him you don’t understand he has alot going on.” Do you have any idea how hard i cried when i saw this man ready to beat my mother to the ground after yelling at his own mother telling her to go ahead and kill herself, the same mother who does absolutely everything for him. And sometimes i tell myself fuck her too for continuesly putting all of us through this absolutely knowing how violent he is. Fuck all of you. Since the day I got diagnosed with PTSD from the past i never thought it would drive me to a point where i felt like i was going insane all over again, not until i saw just how scared i was of men like him, how i saw their faces everywhere i went. 
I remember how I used to love you all when I was little because i was so blind to the kind of people you actually were. To my aunt, how could you call my mother and belittle her and believe all the lies he says after literally listening to him tell his mom to bleed out to death all because she didn’t have more money to give him? To my other aunt, how could you defend all his actions and call my mother a snake just because you feel bad for him since you guys grew up together? You dont get to pick and choose just because you like someone better because if a man yelled at you like that youd be calling the cops right away. To the rest of my family, how could you treat us like criminals just because we dont wanna deal with you all. To my great grandmother, I hope you know being old doesn’t excuse being a shitty person. To my mother, thank you for working your ass off to protect your children and not giving a fuck what everyone else has to say if it means keeping your kids in a safe home. You have worked day and night for years to get me and my brother out of all situations we used to live through, and for that ill always be thankful. To my brother, my uncle german, my aunt adriana, my little cousins, and only some other uncles and aunts, you all are my light and the only family I truly have. To my other aunts, uncles, even older cousins, you know who you guys are, you have spent my whole life milking money out of everyone around you, spreading lies about my real family, making every day impossible. Our time together has been horrible, so from this day, let us never meet again. ",2,1735957939.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

So for context: Just turned 18, about a month ago i saw this gorgeous girl at a bar and had to ask for her socials, which to my suprise she gave me. I then texted her a bit and she wasnt dry at all but wasnt keepin the convo going. At this point my plan was to not text her and just ask her out when I finished my exams. About a week later she actually asked me out which suprised me and we went on the first date which i organised cause she fell sick a bit. It was the first date ive ever been on but luckily it went pretty well, i picked her up in my car, brought her to thr city for coffee, wasnt awkward and she had a great personality, exactly my type. This is where the main issue became noticeable. The issue thats had me on the fence is that shes never texted me, ever. Aside from asking me out, and even after multiple conversations ive started she has never texted me first. Again, like i said before, when i do start a convo shes never dry, replies fast and talks but if i dont start a convo she never will. So then i thought ok maybe she wasnt interested but when i asked her out for the second date she said yes. Today was the 2nd date and again, it went great,  took her out to a nice resto which she rlly liked, tried complimenting her more this time and she said some nice things abt me to. But just like before, after the date nothing, no text or anytning. I had to text her the basic old ""i had a good time etc..."" She told me after i asked her that shed lmk when shes free but i have a deep down feeling she wont. So, basically my question is, seeing how shes also down to hangout and seems interested but that she never texts me, what does this mean. ",1,1735957741.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Janice joined the team with all kinds of zeal and energy, obviously intelligent, driven, and gorgeous. She and I talked some, but to be honest despite the obviously attractive woman I wasnt myself particularly attracted. There were comments by my more outspoken team members of course but mostly I just reminded them that Janice was married and they were gross for the kinds of comments made. Janice however was assigned to my area, and I was charged with her training. 

She shared that she and her husband had moved recently, that she had lost her entire social circle, and that she was looking for people to fill her circle again. I shared that my circle was pretty tight knit, a solid 4, sometimes 5, who gamed frequently, went out to drink occasionally, and were generally pretty open to anyone. So, she opted to join us for some online games, at first this was infrequent but as time went on she began gaming nearly daily. During this time I would make fun of her for acting a bit “boujee” compared to the rest of us, which did seem to upset her so I clarified one day that I was joking, and that I would stop. I further shared some of my past experiences in various ghettos to help her get why some of her, very normal, habits may seem a bit “boujee”. 

Things came to a head when she hit me out of no where with “ThrowAway, I need you to be honest. Do you have a crush on me? You opened up in a way most guys don’t unless they are romantically interested and I am not sure I am comfortable with that. I need to focus on my daughter and husband. This is so awkward if I misread things.” And I told her no, which at the time was true enough, that I had seen enough relationships in my life to be pretty comfortable in my being single. I have my son to tend to, college courses, and no energy, time or inclination really to be crushing on anyone, let alone a married woman. I concluded by telling her that I am very forward when I do have feelings, and I promise to tell her if this changes. She accepted this answer and life went on. 

We continued to game and work, however a couple of weeks later she hits me out of no where again, informing me that she thinks she herself has developed a crush. Stating that, perhaps a bit “counterintuitively” my not having had a crush has perhaps caused her to develop one but she isn’t sure. She asked if she made it awkward and told me that if I wanted to stop contact she understood. I told her I didn’t have feelings but it was flattering if anything and I would be just fine. We played some more games that night, but I did get to thinking. I hadn’t let myself crush on someone since my son’s mother and I had split. I’ve been single fathering and hadn’t given myself the time or room to recover from that really, and wondered if I had been displaying signs of crushing on this woman to begin with. It was the next day that I concluded I had been treating her at least a little differently than I do most people, I was more comfortable around her than most people, and perhaps I had developed a crush. So, as promised, I shared this with her. 

This is where things should have ended, contact cut, but they didn’t. Instead, we began spending more time together. She shared that her husband was emotionally unintelligent, unable to share his feelings with her. That his love languages were gifts and acts of service, while hers were quality time, reassurance and touch. She also shared that they rushed into the marriage, having been together for a short time before Covid hit, which happened to be when her lease was up, so she moved in with him and had a kid not long later. She shared her frustrations with his lack of sharing with her, stating he started going to therapy without ever telling her, and refused to tell her if it was helping him at all, while also refusing marriage therapy with her. 

She and I flirted some, but mostly kept our feelings locked down for a time. A day came however when she went to lunch with her husband, after telling him that she doesn’t think their marriage “has the legs to make it” if they don’t go to therapy together, he finally looked into love languages. She said she was excited about this, incredibly happy, but when she said as much to him he said “I had to, or you would take half my money and my house.” 

I felt for her, I was trying to be there for her, but being there for her with the feelings we have was the wrong call. We grew a lot closer for the next few weeks. Eventually the flirting hit a high, we started being far more open about our feelings, we began having lunches together, getting coffee together, little dates really. Then we went to a Christmas party together and that is where it evolved. There we played games, talked, and after I gave her a hug before driving home. She called me while we drove though, and on the way we talked about how it was obvious we had feelings. We talked about how good it felt to be around each other and she gave me “I wish you had hugged me longer. It’s been less than an hour and I miss you. I think I am in trouble.” 

Less than a week later, we discussed our feelings and I told her that I think I may love her. She reciprocated. She struggled with this for a day, but since then we have been open about that as well. We’ve begun hitting the gym together, we text daily, spend time on the phone, and generally enjoy one another’s company. We drew a hard line on physical interactions beyond hugs, but it hasn’t seemed to matter emotionally. 

This last weekend she told her husband that she want to go to marriage therapy. She has been telling me that she needs to give her marriage a real shot at being fixed. I am supporting her in this, honestly, if that is the path she needs to take to be happy then I am happy for her. We also discussed where we stand though, and neither of us are willing to let the other go. We want to make the core friendship work but it’s hard not to slip into these habits. It’s hard to let some of these habits go. Today she told me that she needs to stop telling me that she loves me. This is maybe the most painful thing she has asked so far. I asked if she did, and she said yes, but every time she says it, it is a small betrayal of her marriage. She said that her husband freaked out, had a melt down about marriage therapy, saying it wouldn’t help and he doesn’t want her to see things that would make her leave, and she wants to lead by example, being honest with him so he can be honest with her but she can’t do that with us being the way we are. 

She asked to talk more tonight, which we will do. But she openly recognized for the first time that this is an emotional affair. That’s where we are now. ",3,1735957560.0,confessions,5,0.8,False

1ht4040,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/1ht4040/what_are_some_things_in_your_transition_that/,What are some things in your transition that happened differently than you expected?,"So I'm about 10 months on T. Been working at a coffee shop since before transition bc coffee shops where I live employ a ton of queer people.

So, that means regulars are watching me transition in real-time. I am to the point where I pass as a cis guy, and I was bracing for people to start saying things to my face.

But, so far, most regulars have just taken it in stride. The only one who still misgenders me is this 80 year old guy who's still nice to me, regardless. I did have one regular comment on my new name and scoff, and insult the fact that I cut my hair off. But he's since started treating me normally again. I do get some icy looks from some people but no comments yet. And a few surprised looks from people who come weekly, but hadn't heard my voice bc I hadn't personally taken their order in a while.

I'm still wary that there's going to be someone who has a problem enough to say something. And I suspect that the main reason I haven't faced direct harassment is bc I'm not a trans woman, so transmisogyny isn't really at play.

I have had a couple shitty transphobic coworkers, but they were both fired for unrelated reasons (ironically, not only were they both transphobic, they were just generally not great people who caused other issues). I expected to encounter more direct transphobia than I have.

1ht3zo6,https://i.redd.it/25rqnj360wae1.jpeg,As a Mexican… did I do okay lol?,"Made everything by scratch except the kimchi /.\


Tried making pork bossam, but it came out a bit too moist and soft. I feel like it should have been firmer—does that sound right?

Next time, I want to try sautéing it first with oil and salt before boiling. Also, instead of coffee, I’m thinking of using Coca-Cola. It might lean more toward carnitas than traditional bossam, but hey, worth a shot! I’ll test it out next week.

Ingredients I Used for the Pork:
	•	Doenjang
	•	½ onion
	•	10 cloves of garlic
	•	½ piece of ginger
	•	Green onion
	•	Water
	•	Nescafé instant coffee
	•	Brown sugar
	•	Salt
	•	Green jalapeño
	•	Bay leaves

For the lettuce, I pickled it with water, vinegar, salt, and sugar.

Thoughts on the Ssamjang:

It turned out soooo good! Just a little too salty, so I added mirin. I also considered adding sugar but worried it might turn out grainy.

Things I’ll Do Differently Next Time:
	•	Cut the lettuce smaller—it was too big, making it hard to do the classic one-bite wrap (or maybe I’m just weak, lol).

Would love to hear any tips or suggestions! Anyone tried using Coke instead of coffee before?",96,1735957249.0,KoreanFood,25,0.97,False

For context, Im 38 with no kids yet. It’s been well over 5 years since Ive been in a serious relationship or dated anyone longer than 6 months. After past relationships going sour quick, Ive sort of fell back until I meet someone worth giving my attention to. Welllllllll I decided to try Hinge again. Instantly matched with a great, handsome, well put together man and he invited me for coffee this evening. The chemistry was amazing! After we parted ways, I couldn’t stop smiling thinking about him……then BOOM. Here comes that nappy headed whore named SELF-SABOTAGE. Started thinking “what if he’s like the rest of the guys Ive dated” and “what if he doesnt really like me and will unmatch and block me soon as we leave” (which he texted me 5 minutes after we left saying how much he enjoyed it) and even the “its been so long since Ive dated anyone, what if I run out of things to talk about” 🥴

Story 5: The Battle of the Broadsword

Captain’s Log, Stardate… I don’t know, Tuesday?

So, get this: we’re cruising through Sector 17, minding our own business, when a bunch of intergalactic cephalopod losers decide to try and ruin my day. Space pirates. Ugly, slimy, tentacled, and unlucky. They picked the wrong ship to mess with—my ship.

Let me set the scene for you. We’re on the UHS Broadsword—top-notch human engineering, baby. Sure, the engine rattles when we hit warp, and the coffee maker has been on strike since last month, but it’s still a beauty. I’m Captain Derrick ""The Baconator"" Carmichael, by the way. Yeah, that’s right—the Derrick Carmichael. The guy who single-handedly made first contact with the Grumboxians and got them hooked on bacon cheeseburgers. So yeah, I’m kind of a big deal.

Anyway, these space pirates pop up on our radar. Their ship? A rust bucket held together with duct tape and bad decisions. Their captain? Some overcompensating squid named Glo’tar The Merciless. Real original. He hails us and goes, “Surrender your ship and cargo, or face annihilation!”

Annihilation? Us? I actually laughed. Out loud.

""And who are you supposed to be? Squidward's uglier brother? Look buddy, if I surrendered every time some tentacle-waving wannabe threatened me, I wouldn't still have a ship. Get lost.” 

He didn’t like that.

They start charging weapons, and my crew looks at me like, “What’s the plan, Captain?” The plan? Oh, the plan was to show these slimy punks exactly why humans are the galaxy’s most unbeatable species.

First move? Comms warfare. We hacked their ship’s intercom system and began broadcasting The Worst Sound Ever Created by Humans™. What’s that, you ask? The audio mashup of a thousand crying babies, dental drills, and bagpipes being played by a pack of drunken cats. We looped it, of course, and within moments, we had pirates banging their heads against the walls and abandoning posts just to make it stop.

Meanwhile, Jenkins, my tactical officer, whipped out Plan B: the Glitter Bomb Fleet Special. That’s right. We launched a payload of high-density glitter canisters directly into their air filtration system. Within seconds, their ship was a sparkling hellscape. Pirates were choking on glitter, slipping on glitter, getting glitter in places no being should ever have glitter. Glo’tar was screaming, “What is this madness?!” Spoiler alert: glitter doesn’t come off. Ever.

Then things got really fun.

The pirates launched boarding pods, figuring brute force was their best shot. Rookie mistake. We waited until their pods docked and then rerouted all the sewage waste from Deck 7 directly into the corridors they were coming through. The second they opened their pod doors? BAM! A tidal wave of bio-waste. You’ve never seen aliens retreat faster in your life.

But a few managed to get onboard. When they stormed the bridge, we hit them with another classic human tactic: unrelenting sarcasm. One pirate bellowed, “Your ship is now property of the Glo’tar Fleet!” 

I replied, “Oh no, not my beloved garbage heap with the broken coffee maker. However will I go on?” Ramirez actually handed one of them a mop and said, “Congrats, you’re captain now. Better start cleaning.”

I almost lost my cool at the dumbfounded expression of the cephalopod's face, but I managed to stop myself from falling over in a fit of laughter when Glo’tar himself finally stormed onto the bridge, dripping glitter and sewage. He roared, “Do you fools have any idea who you’re dealing with?”

“Yeah, a dude who’s about to spend the rest of his life picking glitter out of his crevices.”

By this point, they were done. Half their crew was still incapacitated by the sound loop; the rest were choking on glitter and the ones who made it aboard were wishing they’d chosen literally any other profession. Glo’tar tried to make a last stand, but Jenkins hit him with a stun baton yelling, “This is what happens when you mess with the Broadsword, sucker.”

We herded the pirates back to their pods, slapped a “Kick Me” sign on Glo'tar's back for good measure, and sent them limping back to whatever cesspool they crawled out of. No casualties on our side, unless you count my dignity when I accidentally tripped over a mop bucket during the scuffle.

So, yeah, we totally wrecked them, bro. No big deal. Just another day in the life of The Baconator and the Broadsword. You’re welcome, galaxy.

Captain’s Note: Next time, we’re not using the sewage system as a weapon, unless absolutely necessary. Victory may be sweet, but it sure smells like ass.

### Episode Title: ""The Holloway Haunting""

#### **Opening Scene:**
*Camera opens on an eerie mansion at dusk. Lightning strikes in the distance. The wind howls. A large, decaying sign reads: “Holloway Mansion – Haunted Since 1882.”*

**Host 1 (Max):** ""Welcome to *Ghost Myth Busters,* the only show where we take a scientific approach to your supernatural fears.""

**Host 2 (Eliza):** ""That’s right, Max. And tonight, we’re investigating one of the most famous haunted locations in the region—Holloway Mansion. For over a century, locals have reported seeing ghostly apparitions, hearing unexplainable whispers, and even feeling cold spots that defy explanation.""

**Max (gesturing to the mansion):** ""Sounds like prime ghost territory to me. But we’re here to get to the bottom of it. Are these phenomena the work of restless spirits, or is there a more logical explanation?""

*They both turn toward the entrance, and the door creaks open as if by itself.*

**Eliza:** ""Let’s find out.""

---

#### **Scene 1: The Investigation Begins**
*The hosts walk into the mansion, and the camera follows them as they explore various spooky elements.*

**Max (looking around):** ""First, we’ve got reports of cold spots throughout the mansion. Now, this is a classic indicator of paranormal activity, but can we explain it scientifically?""

*They head toward a room where the temperature appears to drop dramatically. Max holds up a digital thermometer.*

**Max:** ""According to this reading, the temperature dropped 15 degrees in a matter of seconds. Some say this could be the presence of a ghost, but we’ve got a little something for that.""

*Eliza pulls out a portable heater and a fan from their bags.*

**Eliza (smiling):** ""Just a little push from old HVAC science.""

*Max places the heater on the floor and points the fan at the wall, demonstrating how an air conditioning vent in the room could be causing the rapid temperature change.*

**Max (proudly):** ""So, not a ghost. Just bad air circulation and some unlucky airflow patterns.""

**Eliza (nodding):** ""Myth *busted.*""

---

#### **Scene 2: The Portrait Eyes That Follow**
*The camera pans to a large, haunting portrait of a woman hanging in the foyer.*

**Max (reading from the clipboard):** ""Next, there’s the famous portrait of Mrs. Holloway, who is said to... well, *stare* at you as you walk by. People say her eyes follow them wherever they go. Let’s see if we can get to the bottom of this one.""

*Max and Eliza approach the portrait. Eliza steps in front of it while Max pulls out a protractor.*

**Eliza (staring at the painting):** ""Okay, I admit, I’m kind of creeped out by this.""

**Max (smirking):** ""Not so fast. Let’s get our angles right, shall we?""

*He uses the protractor to measure the angle of the portrait relative to Eliza’s position, revealing that the painting’s eyes are positioned in such a way that they give the illusion of following the viewer around.*

**Max (grinning):** ""Busted. It’s all about perspective and lighting. Nothing supernatural about this.""

**Eliza (laughing):** ""Just an optical illusion. Mrs. Holloway isn’t watching you. At least, not in the way you thought.""

---

#### **Scene 3: The Unexplained Phenomena**
*As Max and Eliza walk deeper into the mansion, strange things begin to happen. Lights flicker. A chair in the corner starts to rock by itself. Suddenly, objects begin levitating off the shelves.*

**Max (looking around, startled):** ""Okay, this is... um, electromagnetic fields.""

**Eliza (frowning):** ""Uh, that’s not supposed to happen. So, what’s causing this? Something else?""

*They both look at a vase that begins to float in mid-air.* 

**Eliza:** ""I don’t know, Max. But the science on this one is... well, we don’t know. There’s no easy explanation for this kind of phenomenon.""

*The objects continue to levitate and float toward them. Max and Eliza look at each other.*

**Max (deflecting):** ""You know, sometimes in nature, objects just... magnetize. Sometimes the universe throws us a curveball. This could be magnetic.""

**Eliza (half-joking):** ""It’s like a ghostly flash mob. No idea yet what’s going on, but it sure looks impressive.""

*Max shrugs, clearly avoiding the topic.*

**Max:** ""Yeah. No ghost here. It’s just... electromagnetic fields playing tricks on us, or something.""

---

#### **Scene 4: The Big Reveal**
*They finish their tour of the mansion, and the camera cuts to them standing at the front door. The objects are still floating in the background, the air thick with suspense.*

**Max:** ""So, we’ve busted the temperature drop myth and the ghostly portrait myth.""

**Eliza (smiling, but unsure):** ""Yeah, but... uh, what’s with all the levitating stuff?""

**Max (grinning):** ""It’s fine, Eliza. Let’s grab some coffee. We’ll talk about it later. No ghosts. Just... something else. But that’s the beauty of *Ghost Myth Busters*.""

*The camera zooms in on Max and Eliza as they casually walk off-screen. The objects continue to float eerily behind them.*

**Eliza (calling off-screen):** ""But what about—""

**Max (off-screen):** ""I said it's fine, Eliza.""

*Cue dramatic music as the scene ends, leaving the audience to wonder what *really* happened.*

My fiancée and I are planning on taking our first trip over to the Emerald Isle at the end of March and we’re looking to finalize our air travel and base itinerary. We’re in our late 20s and love exploring new neighborhoods (coffee shops, unique shops, great food) and getting away from the overly touristy things. We’ll be traveling without a car, so anything would need to be accessible by foot, bike, public transit, or tours. How does the following sound so far:

Day 1: Arrive in Dublin early morning, Guinness tour, Trinity College old library (is the Book of Kells worth it?), enjoy the night

Day 2: Day tour to Belfast and Giant’s Causeway, back in Dublin for the night

Day 3: Train to Cork, check out St. Anne’s, English Market, the Lough

Day 4: Bus to Kinsale for the Scilly Walk, lunch, bus back to Cork for the night

Day 5: Train the Killarney for the day, hop on hop off bus for a few sites (Torc Waterfall, Muckross House)

Day 6: Day tour around the Ring of Kerry

Days 7-9: ???

Day 10: Fly back from Dublin 

I know we’re definitely missing some things, so please feel free to offer some suggestions. How could we fit in Galway in a way that make sense? What other towns could we spend a day in?

Also, is there any good way to spot puffins that would be accessible to us? It was my mom’s dream to see puffins and she recently passed; I want to be able to honor her in some way this trip.
