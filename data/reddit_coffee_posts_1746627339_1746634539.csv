1kh1bz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1kh1bz5/how_do_i_get_close_to_people/,How do I get close to people?,"I know a lot of people but I don't really get close to people. I go to lots of college societies, probably like 10 different ones (no specific one very consistently though). Generally people have their own different friend groups and I start to get along with them but I never quite become a part of any of them or get invited to anything outside the society. I started a groupchat for a study group but nobody shows up to study when I say I'm around campus lol. I go out to gigs and talk to people between sets and in smoking areas of clubs, but I don't get anyone's Instagrams or see them again. I used to have parties where I'd invite about 60 people and just over 20 would show up, which is a good turnout and it was a different group that would show up every time so lots of people, but again it never really felt like I was properly friends with any of these people, just that they liked me and would come to my parties and it was all great fun at the time but then I wouldn't see a lot of them for a few months until the next one. At work I am very friendly with everyone and they're happy to see me, but we don't hang out outside of work. Most people I actually become close with are girls that I get crushes on and they just want to be friends, or my ex who is like my best friend lol. I'm not sure why this all is. Partly I can see that I don't make much of an effort to DM people, I don't post insta stories for people to reply to to make it easy for them to DM me, I don't invite anyone to get drinks or coffee or food or especially do anything at my place because I either assume they don't want to hang out with me or it's a girl and I assume they'll think I'm hitting on them, I'm not as brazen about asking to be invited to other people's plans as I used to be (which wasn't even that much), I don't say hi to people I know sometimes if it's not a sanctioned social event like a society because I assume they don't want to talk to me (a lot of the time I do though and start chatting to them), and I don't have housemates and I don't go to my lectures and I'm not involved with any organisations or committees so there's not much consistency or teamwork in my life. But I feel like if I have well over 100 acquaintances, there should be more than 3 of them that are actually interested in me enough to initiate conversation with me. People should invite me to things. How is everyone else in a proper friend group when none of my close friends even live near me anymore? I just wonder if maybe someone else has had this problem and realised eventually that they weren't warm enough or were closed off in some way that made people respond like this?

I’ve been using the DeLonghi Dedica Conical Burr Grinder to make 2–3 cups of pour over coffee each day, mostly with light-roasted Ethiopian beans. Overall, I’ve been pretty satisfied with it.

That said, I’ve heard a lot of praise for the Baratza Encore, and I found a brand new one for $130. I’m wondering: is the upgrade worth it? Will I notice a **significant improvement** in cup quality, or is the difference going to be more **marginal** for someone already content with their setup?

1kh1btp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kh1btp,"Restaurant Dan Arnold (18 hats AGFG) - Brisbane, Australia - April 2025","On our recent trip to Australia, we had the opportunity to visit Brisbane for six days.  It has a pretty vibrant food scene at different price points and my wife & I were fortunate enough to sample a few of the higher end establishments the city has to offer.  Restaurant Dan Arnold in located in the Fortitude Valley area of Brisbane and is about a 15 min taxi ride from the Brisbane CBD. It is highly rated by the Australian Good Food Guide with 18 hats out of a possible 20. For reference, there are no 20 hat restaurants in Australia at the moment in 2025.

The space is relatively large with neutral wooden tones, floor to ceiling windows and with both table and bar seating.  We dined the night before a national holiday so it was busy but not bustling.

There are three menu offerings: a shortened 3 course, the standard 5 course or an extended ""carte blanche"" course.  We went with the latter for $240AUD and I want to say it was about 10 courses (2 groups of snacks, 6 middle courses + bread, 2 desserts + petit-fours).  Wine pairing available for all but we did not partake.

Apologies for the camera work (old iPhone). Unfortunately no menu was provided and I have to go by my crappy notes so there will be a lack of detail on several items. Apologies for that too.

Snacks 1 (served prior to menu selection): Australian waygu tartare, kolrabi ravioli, eggplant crisp

Snacks 2:  fish terrine, chicken curry bun,  goat cheese with fig purée

Sea urchin w/ caviar, oyster & apple tart

Prawn, scallop mousseline

Bread course (sourdough, molasses, brioche) with sage butter and salted butter.

Steamed coral trout, tempura perilla leaf, yuzu, apple, daikon with dashi/apple vinaigrette.

Sweetbread & celeriac ""risotto"" .

Duo of duck. Filet/magret wrapped in prosciutto, samosa of confit leg & stuffed pepper.

BBQ short rib & 9-score Australian wagyu strip loin. Coffee, onion, onion jus.

Dessert 1: Breton sablé, kumquat, ginger, ginger beer, sorbet.

Dessert 2: Cocoa & tahini chantilly, chocolate sorbet, kumquat

Petit-fours.

Service was well intentioned but a little awkward, with a mix of wait and kitchen staff serving the courses.  The wait staff was kind but a little unsteady while the kitchen staff was professional but gave the impression they would rather be in the kitchen. While it was nothing worrisome, it just felt uneven. Also (as can be seen in my notes), i would have preferred a slower description of the plates being presented not having a physical menu reference.

Food-wise, the last four ""main courses"", starting with the coral trout were the strongest parts of the meal, with the sweetbread being my favourite dish of the night.  I was happy but not amazed by any particular dish and in that sense I feel like my perception aligns with what I read in some reviews on the BrisbaneFoodies subreddit. Overall, it was well executed food and I would recommend a visit.

1kh1anc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kh1anc/could_bodum_pour_over_coffee_maker_redefine_your/,Could Bodum Pour Over Coffee Maker Redefine Your Daily Brew Routine Review?,"Bodum 11571-109US Pour Over Coffee Maker, as described, seemed like the ideal addition to my kitchen. My mornings revolve heavily around coffee, so having a reliable, user-friendly brewing tool was critical. Testing this coffee maker daily for a few weeks, I uncovered both its standout features and a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The first thing that caught my eye about this pour-over coffee maker was its chic, minimalist design. With a cork grip that felt both stylish and comfortable, the mix of natural tones and the transparent borosilicate glass carafe blended seamlessly into my kitchen. The glass is surprisingly sturdy, even though it looks so delicate. It gave me confidence that it could withstand daily use without easily chipping. Although compact and lightweight at just 1.21 pounds, it didn’t feel flimsy in the hand. Plus, at 5.63"" deep and 8"" wide, it didn’t take up much counter space—a huge win for small kitchens!  

[Check Bodum 11571-109US Pour Over Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07kqvw6rr/)  

**Ease of Use and Brewing Process**  
Making coffee with this pour-over system turned out to be ridiculously simple. I picked coarse-ground coffee, placed it into the reusable stainless steel filter, and began the ritualistic pouring of hot water in a circular motion—watching it drip into the glass carafe was strangely satisfying. Brew time averaged just 3-4 minutes, and I felt like a mini barista prepping a perfect cup. The manual operation means no buttons, screens, or unnecessary distractions, something I appreciated. However, for someone who’s rushing, this method might lack the speed or automation they need.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Durable borosilicate glass that resists heat and breakage.  
- Elegant cork band doubles as insulation for handling the carafe.  
- The permanent stainless steel mesh filter enhanced my coffee’s flavor by preserving natural oils.  
- Lightweight and compact, it fits anywhere.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Every component being dishwasher safe had me sighing in relief. The stainless steel mesh filter needed a little extra care to maintain full efficiency. I found it easiest to rinse and scrub briefly under warm water after each brew to avoid coffee grounds building up. Allowing grounds to linger in the filter leads to slight clogging, which, on one rushed morning, delayed my coffee-making process. Though not a dealbreaker, it’s something to keep in mind.

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The cork band, while stylish, isn’t removable for deep cleaning, which left me a bit paranoid about water seeping below its edge.  
- Manual operation is slower compared to automatic brewers.  
- Stainless steel filter tends to trap fine grounds, so the coffee needs to be measured and ground carefully.  

**How It Compares to Peer Products**  
Having tried Chemex and Hario pour-over systems in the past, they each offered different quirks compared to this one. Chemex’s design is equally aesthetic but relies on disposable paper filters, which I found wasteful and less eco-friendly. Hario V60, on the other hand, required a bit more skill with water pouring to get a consistent brew, which felt cumbersome in the mornings. This coffee maker from Bodum balanced that learning curve while also being kinder to the environment with a reusable filter. The only point where Chemex excels is capacity—if you’re brewing for more than two people regularly, Bodum’s limitation to 8 cups, 4 oz each, might feel restrictive.  

**Price Worthiness**  
While the upfront cost might deter some, the long-term savings on paper filters and the higher quality of a reusable mesh make it a reasonable investment. It felt like I was getting my money's worth considering the simple yet refined coffee brewing experience it provided. For someone passionate about hand-crafted coffee, it gives a premium experience without being overly pricey like some competing pour-over systems.

Every mom deserves a day that’s all about her. Between busy schedules and never-ending to-dos, self-care often slips to the bottom of the list. A well-planned relaxing day can make her feel valued and truly special.

If you’re looking to [shop Mother’s Day gifts](https://amzn.to/4lZhbjn) or need inspiration for [unique Mother’s Day gifts](https://amzn.to/436eDaL), you’re in the right place. This post covers ideas that work for any mom — whether you’re [shopping for your wife, friends, grandma](https://amzn.to/3Z8lYFk), or just need a helpful Mother’s Day gift guide. Making time to help moms recharge matters, and with the right gifts and thoughtful touches, you’ll give her the break she deserves.

# Understanding What Moms Really Need To Relax

Giving moms genuine time to unwind is about more than [bubble baths and candles](https://amzn.to/4jGrEP3) (though those help!). Before shopping for [unique Mother’s Day gifts](https://amzn.to/4ksqtDd), it pays to understand both the daily demands she faces and what “relaxation” means to her. Meeting a mom where she’s at isn’t just thoughtful — it’s a meaningful way to show her your support.

# Recognizing Mom’s Daily Challenges: Detail Common Stressors and Signs a Mom Needs a Break

Photo by [Leeloo The First](https://www.pexels.com/@leeloothefirst)

Motherhood often comes with a nonstop to-do list. From early mornings juggling breakfast and backpacks to late-night chores, moms have little time for themselves. The stress isn’t just about caring for kids — many manage homes, jobs, and family schedules, with their own needs pushed aside.

Daily stress can lead to:

* **Constant fatigue:** She’s tired well before the day is done.
* **Short temper:** Small annoyances trigger big reactions.
* **Feeling overwhelmed:** Everything seems like too much.
* **Neglecting self-care:** She skips her usual routines to care for others.
* **Emotional burnout:** Tears or anxiety come out of nowhere.

According to [Mother.ly’s advice on avoiding burnout](https://www.mother.ly/health-wellness/self-care/you-need-a-breakbefore-you-break-mama/), ignoring these signs makes it harder for moms to recharge — even on special days.

To truly show support, start by noticing when she’s overdue for a break. Recognize the hints, then take real steps to lighten her load — not just for a holiday, but as often as you can. For more ideas on spotting the warning signs, see this list of [clear signs moms need a break](https://justabasicmama.com/7-clear-signs-moms-need-a-break-and-how-to-make-it-happen/).

# Personalized Relaxation: What She Actually Wants

The right gift — or gesture — isn’t the same for everyone. “Personalized” means thinking about her as a whole person, not just as “Mom.” The key is to tailor relaxation to her life and preferences.

When you [shop Mother’s Day gifts](https://amzn.to/4k6xMjs), it’s helpful to keep relationship and personality in mind. Here’s how you can make the experience special for different moms:

**For your wife:**

* She may love a day away from routine — think breakfast in bed, time for her hobbies, or a pampering spa set. Many find [unique Mother’s Day gifts](https://amzn.to/4dcBq9w), like a [piece of custom jewelry](https://amzn.to/44rsv1y) or a [heartfelt letter](https://amzn.to/4d6nQEh), most meaningful.

**For a close friend:**

* Fun, low-cost gestures go a long way. Arrange a picnic, a cozy brunch with friends, or a DIY spa kit.[ Mother’s Day gifts for friends](https://amzn.to/436j7hB) often focus on experiences — a shared coffee date or a girls’ movie night.

**For grandma:**

* Grandmothers appreciate feeling remembered. [Shop Mother’s Day gifts that celebrate her legacy](https://amzn.to/4k7cDps), like a photo album or homemade treat from the grandkids. Crafts, personalized keepsakes, or comfy essentials show you care.

When planning or purchasing [unique Mother’s Day gifts](https://amzn.to/4iUDmoa), think past the item itself. The gesture should help her unwind in a way that feels right for her. According to [Scripps Health’s tips for busy moms](https://www.scripps.org/news_items/5716-stress-busting-tips-for-busy-moms), small routines and thoughtful surprises often make the biggest impact — so gifts don’t have to be expensive to be meaningful.

[Cheap gifts for Mother’s Day](https://amzn.to/44XUWnN) — like candles, books, or a favorite snack — can still offer joy if chosen with care. Check a thoughtful [Mother’s Day gift guide](https://amzn.to/3SmXVPg) for more ways to [spark relaxation](https://amzn.to/4dcpDbi), whether [shopping for a wife, friend, or grandma](https://amzn.to/4k6xMjs).

# The Role of Family and Friends in Making the Day Special: Advise on involving kids, spouses, and friends to ensure mom feels appreciated without being responsible for the day’s planning

A truly relaxing day happens when mom isn’t the one organizing (or cleaning up) everything. Rally your team — kids, partners, friends — to treat her like a queen.

Here are ways family and friends can pitch in:

* **Assign small tasks:** Kids tidy the house, set the table, or help wrap gifts.
* **Partner takes the lead:** Spouse plans the day’s flow, so mom joins as a guest.
* **Surprise connections:** Friends or relatives call, video chat, or drop by with a treat.
* **Group gratitude:** Everyone shares what they appreciate about her, either over dinner or in a video.

This teamwork reduces mom’s mental load, showing she’s loved in both words and actions. Sharing stories, laughter, and hugs turns ordinary moments into unforgettable memories.

Inclusion is key — invite everyone, but let mom relax without needing to host or direct. When family and friends work together, the gift is not just a break from responsibility but a reminder that she’s cherished every day — not just on Mother’s Day.

Hey friends, I wanted to share something I did as a personal experiment that genuinely surprised me. For context, I’m the kind of person who needs structure or I’ll forget everything (ADHD gang, I see you). I’ve been into spiritual stuff for a while energy, intuition, signs but I never committed to tracking anything. Until now.

I decided to journal every angel number or “synchronicity” I noticed for 30 days. Just a simple log date, time, number, where I saw it (phone, license plate, microwave, etc), and what I was thinking or doing. That’s it. I used this free numerology journal I found online no sign-up, nothing sketchy, just a clean PDF I could print or edit digitally.

Week 1 was... random. I noticed 111, 444, and 1212 a few times, but I chalked it up to coincidence. But once I started **writing them down**, I began *noticing them more*. Not just on clocks, but receipts, emails, even random page numbers. The act of journaling made me more aware, and that awareness started to ripple into other areas.

By Week 2, something weird happened I started associating certain numbers with *emotions or thoughts*. 555 always came up when I was doubting myself. 222 would pop up during moments I was reconnecting with people. It wasn’t just numbers it was context.

Week 3 hit different. I had a tough conversation with a friend I’d fallen out with. Right before I sent the “hey can we talk” text? 1111 on the phone. Right after we talked and it felt healing? 777 on the receipt from the coffee shop. It was almost eerie in a comforting way.

By the end of the month, I wasn’t just noticing angel numbers I was using them to check in with myself. If I saw 333, I’d literally pause and ask: *Am I aligned right now? What needs balancing?* It wasn’t about the universe sending me magic messages it was more like a spiritual feedback loop I could *interact* with.

# I’m not claiming this will change your life overnight, but I’ll say this: writing down synchronicities gave them space to mean something. Even if it’s just a reflection tool, it worked. I felt more intentional, more connected to the moment, and more confident that I wasn’t just floating through my day.

If you’re curious or skeptical, just try it. Even for a week. Let me know!!!

1kh14l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1kh14l6/feeling_abandoned_by_god/,Feeling abandoned by God,"I posted part of this a few days ago but decided to delete it and start over. 

I know this beyond a lengthy post. I’m exhausted not just physically but also cognitively/mentally and spiritually as I’m writing all of this. 

And while posing some questions, much of this is also me just sharing what I’ve gone through because I honestly feel like I am nearing the end of my life and just need to share to not feel so alone in all of this. 

I am also asking for prayer. 

I currently live alone and am very isolated — presently without friends or family in my life or even regular acquaintances and I feel so bewildered and lost and completely battered by the Enemy. 

I also feel rejected and abandoned by God; am so confused and am left with so many unanswered questions that I’ve brought to Him while He remains silent. 

I just feel so broken down; worthless; unwanted and unloved by Him.  

I suppose I am looking for just a shred of hope that I’m not too far gone but I have been left seriously questioning if what I’ve been going through might very well be a form of God’s judgment and no longer simply attacks by the Enemy because I am a threat to the Kingdom — which is what I had been believing for some time. 

But faith is meant to be strengthened not weakened in the midst of adversity and spiritual warfare. And a true soldier of Christ would have the authority over the realm(s) of darkness and demons. 

This may be a bit all over the place but I’ll just begin. 

In my own desperation of trying to understand just how I have arrived where I am in my relationship with God and over the course of investing hours upon hours over the past couple of years I came upon one particular article on Desiring God’s website regarding the inability to obey God without God. 

 If one cannot authentically love God and obey without God (Holy Spirit) to begin with how does someone who desires to be born again follow Jesus and obey Him while waiting on the Father to finally send the Holy Spirit? 

I finally realized and understood that worship and prayer is not received by God unless someone is born again so how does someone even continue to pursue Him in the meantime, apart from reading and studying the Bible? And even then the Holy Spirit is the glue that enables one to truly obey and is frequently mentioned in the New Testament so….how does someone just overlook that? 

How much is enough and what does someone do who may not have as much “steam” to motivate and propel them as others? 

What if someone suffers with certain obstacles due to trauma or mental illness that interfere? 

I’ve even read of testimonies of people having been dedicated to serving others; often heading up various ministries within the church; leading others to Christ and being active in their communities; tithing; giving to the less fortunate; and living with integrity and biblical moral principles who believed they were Christians until they then finally realized they weren’t born again then cried out to the Lord asking Him to save them and finally encountered and received the Holy Spirit. One was even a pastor’s wife. 

I don't think I have a hardened heart?

I feel empathy; I hurt when others hurt and I don't wish ill will on anyone nor do I seek revenge when wronged.

But I do feel absolutely traumatized and almost numb after last year, especially. I feel like a shell of who I used to be and like all the beautiful things that I used to appreciate about myself have been progressively given away over the years and I’ve been left almost completely empty. I choose to forgive and for most of my life tried to see the best in others and to understand what makes people behave the way they do which helped me to forgive. I hated participating in gossip; tried to hold myself accountable; showed honesty and integrity in my life, apart from self sabotaging many opportunities due to social anxiety and panic disorder. I would look at people and remember that they were once an innocent infant and that everyone has experienced trauma to one degree or another. But I do struggle with maintaining authentic connection with others and although I'm friendly and people have extended friendship over the years and I’ve often been told that I put people at ease —or used to — I seemed to largely attract those who were not necessarily healthy for me more than those who were, or would've been. And those that seemed like they were well adjusted and healthy I was often scared that I wasn’t good enough and feared being rejected so I would shy away. 

In a nutshell, after being raised going to church and actively participating and attending Christian schools and after over 45 years of believing that Jesus was my Savior and I was a child of God, then eventually realizing I was not living a set apart life and then doing what I could to change this, I still experienced no personal relationship with Jesus. 

I have prayed so many times asking for a new heart and the Holy Spirit but nothing happens. 

I’ve heard that we don’t have to clean ourselves up first before asking Jesus to be Lord of our lives. That it is a heart decision to believe on and trust in the finished work of the cross for forgiveness of our sins and that all we have to do is acknowledge we are sinners and that we can’t save ourselves and receive this as Truth and Jesus will then become our personal Savior and the Holy Spirit will dwell with and do the work within us as we partner with Him. 

I thought had done this. 

But then I have also heard that one must confess all past and current known sins and turn away from all of them before receiving Jesus as Lord. 

I tried this, too, but struggled with wondering how I would know if I truly had? Is it just the obvious unGodly mindsets and participating in worldly activities that one knows are not glorifying to God? What are the exact types of things someone should be scanning in their life? 

Is it mostly the 10 commandments one should use as a gauge?  

I’m left with contemplating that I must not have repented enough or that my motives in wanting a relationship with Jesus must not be sincere or pure as I thought which I don’t understand because I want to be selfless — I’m so tired of being in my head all the time. I want to give to others, which I used to do as best I could. I loved working in healthcare and helping others. I loved encouraging and building others up. I loved giving generously to others. I had social anxiety but I really tried. 

I went through a terrifying experience beginning in March of 2020 (psychosis —largely spiritual/religious, in nature) that truly shook me to my core and that I would go in & out of for over a year and a half. It has clearly caused some brain damage and I’ve read can take years to recover from. I was unknowlingly transitioning to menopause and experiencing a significant drop in estrogen; was isolated; sleep deprived; overwhelmed; and tapering off a strong antidepressant, all of which contributed to the psychosis and prolonged it. This, following over 35 years of battling often crippling anxiety in various forms and then eventually often debilitating depression that all of it combined was eventually in recent years diagnosed as PTSD or a subset of complex PTSD as I didn’t meet all the criteria for CPTSD. I have also wondered, however, off & on for several years if I might actually be on the autism spectrum because as I look back I had/have several shared traits and behaviors beginning as even a baby/todder that were/are consistent with those with autism. 

I had never experienced psychosis before and it was multifaceted involving several delusions that would morph and I both said things and behaved in ways completely out of character, at times, and that both hurt as well as frightened my family (of origin) and one person that I had met during, which left me feeling absolutely gutted; confused; frightened; and deeply ashamed. How do you even begin to apologize…. I sought forgiveness but still wrestle with forgiving myself and my family has kept their distance, which only added to the estrangement that had already been present for several years, apart from a loose connection with my parents. There is a lot of dysfunction in my family, including some unacknowledged narcissism and favoritism that would shift from one child to another and caused some rivalry and far too much triangulating and indirect conversation when conflict was present. Talking openly and directly addressing family issues was simply not done in my family and things were often brushed under the rug. I sought out both therapy and psychiatry to try to heal but was the only one doing so and over 25 years of antidepressant use only led to worsening  anxiety and prolonged depression and suicidal ideation which greatly affected my attendance in work settings. 

I love my family and always wanted us to be close and we all played our parts in the dysfunction to some degree but we all needed counseling. I have also always been too unrealistic and idealistic and believed that one day there would be reconciliation and healing for all of us...

I have been praying that somehow God would somehow use my psychosis to wake up my family to the realities of spiritual warfare, because I have no doubt that there was also a sincere spiritual component to i and there definitely has been in the aftermath of the last few years. My prayer and hope has been that because of what I experienced my family members would somehow be prompted to draw near —or nearer — to God. To examine their own lives to see if they were truly in the faith as I did, for those who have believed they are saved and for those who are not that it would almost scare them into seeking and turning to God. 

The thought of any of them ending up not in heaven is absolutely overwhelming for me and crushing to contemplate….

I plunged into Scripture both during and following this breakdown and much more than in years past and I realized that I had lived the life of a carnal Christian. For the first time I truly sought to center my world around God and to fervently seek Him daily. I thought that this must be why He allowed me to go through such a terrifying experience — to wake me up to the changes I needed to make. I saw areas where I realized I needed to repent and did so and asked for Holy Spirit to show me where there was still sin and to empower me to overcome it. I was still believing that I was God’s child. But after two years of this (following the psychosis) and listening to more and more Christian content: sermons; studies; testimonies, reading more of my Bible, etc., I realized that I had never experienced the intimacy with God that is meant to be experienced between God and His children and that I didn't even know was truly possible prior to this. 

For the first time I began questioning my salvation. I chose to finally be baptized thinking perhaps this had been a barrier previously. I spoke to my pastor and an elder at the small church I had been attending for about a year regarding my concerns and was assured that I was saved, citing Romans 10:9: “If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” as evidence. As I shared the psychosis I had just come out of with my pastor and a few other people and then began experiencing terrible anhedonia for another I was encouraged to focus on God’s love for me more than anything else for a while until it settled into my heart (as it did when I was a child, or as I had believed it had).

By this time I had truly developed a sincere desire to dedicate my life to Jesus Christ and to point others to Him but was still dealing with profound shame; trying to recover without much of a support system; and in need of rest and healing. Still I would push myself through social anxiety to meet people and engage in small talk and to get to know them better. I had always had a soft spot for the “underdog” or the left out so would notice those on Sunday who were overlooked at church and would sit by them. I also wanted to serve in a church outreach but there weren’t many service opportunities. 

I also began listening to hours of self deliverance videos and also began to notice feeling sick the night before, or morning of, church more than a few times. 

I continued reading and studying my Bible and came upon Paul’s admonition to examine one’s faith. I also read 1, 2, and 3 John for the first time and became concerned. 

I then met with my pastor and one of the elder’s wives because I didn’t experience the Holy Spirit as I came to understand true believers were meant to. 

For example, there has never be any fellowship/communication/communion during prayer; no feeling God’s presence (His love/peace) when just talking to and sharing things with Him or even when scared and crying out. No enlightening/highlighting of Scripture or deeper understanding when reading my Bible, nor personal revelation. I would often find many passages confusing and even felt some condemnation with certain verses. I would receive no personal direction nor instruction even when bringing everything to God first. I was praying for God’s will to be done in and through my life and was doing my best to wait on instruction by Him but never received any. I tried to obey in areas that I knew were glorifying to God. My pastor told me that He saw Christ’s love in me, but I said that even what seem to fruits of the Spirit can be seen in unbelievers and I knew that I felt vastly short of many others and certainly of God’s glory. 

Even after a two + hour conversation about these things they both still tried to convince me that I was saved. 

Daily — every morning and at other times I would look forward to sitting down and reading my Bible, but I just kept hitting these walls. For example, Proverbs was difficult because I even struggled to understand some of it as well as realized that I had never even read the majority of it while growing up and if I had could have avoided so many poor choices that have affected me today — many that feel irreversible. I could say the same for other passages, as well. 

Even when reading the gospels now reading  Jesus’ very words that are meant to be encouraging while providing instruction I felt/feel such a failure. It's so strange to me because in all my previous years of reading by Bible; attending church; even the occasional Bible study….. before reaching the point of questioning my salvation I never felt condemned, at all, although I hadn't realized until the last few years just how much of it I had actually yet to read. 

I then thought that maybe the problem with finding no intimacy was because I had never told God that I surrender every area of my life to Him -- that I had never actually invited Him to be Lord of my life and not just my personal Savior. So I did this by telling Him and asking Him to take full control over my life. I was praying for my tastes and desires to align with His; to hate what He hates and loves what He loves. I prayer for strangers; families; neighbors for what they needed most spiritually and then practically. Prayers for myself were Godly prayers and not materialistic or desiring status, etc., I prayed for a pure heart inviting Jesus to do whatever was necessary to refine me and cleanse me… 

I began implementing intermittent fasting on a daily basis in late 2023 for health reasons and saw some wonderful improvement and health benefits but then in early 2024 began to use this also as a way to draw closer to the Lord. 

In November of 2022 just before Thanksgiving when I was feeling alone and with nowhere to go to celebrate the holiday I experienced what would be the first of several synchronicities such as while listening to worship music (which was pretty much always playing in my apartment) and reading something faith based in a book or blog/Facebook post, etc., I’d find them matching up. 

As I was feeling overwhelming anxiety I opened and turned to a reading from a small little Christian book for anxiety sufferers called, “Breath As Prayer” and the Scripture reference was Isaiah 41:13: “For I am the Lord your God, who takes hold of your right hand, saying to you, Do not fear; I will help you."" As I was reading the devotional part that spoke about how comforting it is when anxious to have someone hold your hand I read a line that said “He is already holding onto you” and the song by Crowder, “I Am” had just begun to play on my radio in the background and the lyric, “I Am holding onto you” played at the exact same time that I read the very script in the book. 

Several days later I also had the words, “the writing’s on the wall” randomly come my mind which really frightened me as I immediately thought of the story of King Nebudchanezzar and how he had been found wanting. I don’t recall what I was thinking just before or if I had been asking God a question. 

I would notice a lot of things seeming to line up so much so that I began to question just what the source was. 

I shared each experience with my pastor as I experienced them and mentioned that even after the first “encounter” that I didn’t feel peace wash over me, at all. Then, with the second, He said that, perhaps, God was telling me to literally look to my wall. I told him that I did have a plaque with a condensed version of Philippians 4:6-7 printed on it hanging on my wall. “Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” And He was sure that this must be God directing me to it. 

I said that I was concerned and was doubting that it was truly God communicating with me. He was gentle and patient and said that He had found it not always wise to question how God chooses to speak to us. 

So as I began to experience more of these synchronicities over 2023 and then quite a bit more into 2024, I started to embrace them. 

I had begun by this time to watch a YouTube channel, “Dappy T Keys” on my tv and would meditate on the verses. 

On one occasion in 2023 as I sat down to eat my dinner, I glanced up and Revelation 3:20 was displayed: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.""

I thought this was Jesus being lighthearted with me. 

I truly felt what seemed like God’s presence while watching and meditating on this channel. It felt like He was right with me in my small apartment and that I was not alone. 

And, another time, I had just prepared a really delicious and healthy salad and sat down for lunch and again had Dappy T Keys playing in the background on my tv. I had just prayed a blessing over my meal, taken my first bite, then glanced up and Psalm 103:5 was displayed: “Who satisfies your mouth with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's."" 

Another example in 2024 was as I was on Facebook and Kyle Winkler recorded a short video for Valentine’s Day last year he was opening a card that was meant to be a love letter from God — it was beautiful (I recommend looking it up for yourself). Just as He was a few words in, Chris Tomlin’s, “Love letter in the Sky” began playing in the background on my radio.

I was so overwhelmed with feeling God’s love for me -- especially my Abba Father's.

The majority were during 2024 as I was in the midst of the intense harassment that I share further down, and they provided such comfort and strength. I was still very stressed out, but I felt that God had control; was encouraged, and was sure that He must be with me and didn’t feel alone.

I even shared several of these on my Facebook, as an encouragement to others and to show how God knows us so well and uses what He knows how best to reach us, personally, in the best way at any given time. 

But when I would shut everything off and try unplugging …. and just sit with the Lord — or attempt to in the quiet — it was just deafening silence and I wasn’t feeling Him with me. 

I also began seeing daily repeating number patterns which I first did years ago when I was deceived by “angel numbers” during a very vulnerable period in my life following the suicide of my friend and boyfriend. It was only 11:11 then and maybe 1:11 and another grouping. I eventually realized they were demonic and stopped seeing them until 2020 when I began to see these again and then just a few more. This time I discovered the Hebrew/Jewish gematria and thought they must be safe and a form of God speaking. 

Then I discovered that this was a form of jewish mysticism and unbiblical. I stopped seeing them again until last year. This time, I began to see several more on a regular basis and could not ignore it. 1:11;11:11; 222;333;411;444;555;711;714;747;911; and finally 10:10. 

I decided to look into it again and discovered several articles as well as ministries that give credence to these. Many websites were easy to dismiss due to the new age jargon interspersed while others were not because they were often associated with prophetic ministries; would caution regarding testing the spirit behind any message and would often recommend either referring to Strongs Concordance to try and determine what God was saying to you through these numbers or to look up potential chapters and verses that God might be using to speak to you and to ask Him for personal revelation and/or to ask for confirmation from the Holy Spirit that any attached message given by the video message was even meant for you. 

So, for a while I became caught up in these because there were specific groupings that I would see more often at times than others and I would find a recent video mentioning that if seeing these numbers frequently lately, such as 555, for example this referred to God’s strength or grace. I took these as another external sign that God must be speaking to me, but never experienced any personal revelation from God as I would talk to Him about it. 

As far as potentially “hearing” from God apart from these things I would often have Scripture come to mind when busy that would sometimes seem to apply to what I might be doing, at times, but not anything I wasn’t already familiar with, and never anything that provided a fresh revelation or that provided direction of how to tackle a certain decision when seeking wisdom. 

There was only one time that I recall where I was certain I heard the Lord speak to me in the quiet. I had become so fearful of my future as well as been asking for confirmation of my salvation and woke up so anxious. I was lying on my couch in the early morning and as I woke up began praying to Him before even opening my eyes as I often did most mornings and the phrase, “I will sustain you” entered my mind. At the same time I turned to my phone to look up verses with this phrase, the song title by Ellie Holcomb, “I Will Carry You” also entered my mind. The first verse that I found was Isaiah 46:4: “Even to your old age and gray hairs I am He, I am He Who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you.”

I was overcome will both relief and joy. Firstly, because I had been praying for some time to please hear a word from God. And, secondly, because this must mean that I was, indeed, His child. 

I feel like I have been almost trying to force a relationship with Jesus that He never, personally, invited me into. 

By last September I just couldn’t continue on as I had been. After over two years of centering my life around God and doing all that I could I began to feel like a fraud and didn’t want to bring shame to Jesus’ Name if I didn’t belong to Him by presenting myself as a Christian. So I stopped everything — my Bible reading; daily worship; fasting; praying and talking to Him throughout the day every day; listening to sermons…. It was the most viscerally painful soul wrenching thing I had ever gone through. For the first few weeks, certain Scripture and song lyrics would flood my mind. To quiet it I forced myself to watch neutral programming before eventually beginning to watch more secular programming like I used to. But I hated it, at first and wrestled with it. I just felt so alone and it was akin to company. I couldn’t even talk to my neighbors anymore nor anyone else — not that I had anyone else in my life by this time to talk with.

I could no longer function and retreated to my bed. Trying to live in a world without the reassurance of  being God’s child is impossible. I can no longer enjoy nature because His hand is evident in everything and sunrises and sunsets were such a personal thing for me. Or dandelions.... and other things. I would feel close to God often when in nature. But now it just hurt too much and the thought would make me weep. I can no longer hold onto hope that one day all the pain will be gone and I’ll be with Jesus forever to love Him and worship and sing to Him. I’ll never see my pets and any loved ones who belong to Him again along with my eldest sister who died as an infant before I was born. 

Living with daily fear of God’s judgment and of going to hell… knowing that God sees me as His enemy now... or must have always... and never loved me. I can’t begin to explain the experience.

I have literally been wasting away both physically and spiritually. I can hardly move about because I’ve lost so much muscle mass and strength.

I had begun to follow a woman on Facebook and YouTube off & on beginning in 2022, I believe who started off as a deliverance minister along with her husband. They had been doing this for over 20 years. Two of the most humble, loving, and kind souls whose pure love for, and devotion to, the Lord are just beautiful and evident. They know their Bibles well and many messages are filled with Scripture. 

Beginning in January of last year her focus began to shift to delivering messages from the Father to His children as she was being led to. She was given the gifts of that of a prophetic seer and was very clear that this was not what she called herself, being a seer, it was what Father called her. By this time in her many years of walking with the Lord she would be taken in the Spirit regularly; had dreams and visions; and spoke in tongues as a prayer language and weekly worship would typically last six or more hours at their church each week. She would share before delivering messages and as she would talk to the Lord that she knew she was accountable to Him, etc., She truly loves people and glows with the love of Christ. Her testimony is also both beautiful and powerful. 

In January  of last year I listened to one of the first messages. She said that the Holy Spirit knew who would be listening and that if you were, this meant you were a child of God — even if you had yet to realize it. 

After what I had experienced in 2020 and 2021 which left be absolutely devastated and with no where to turn because the very nature of the psychosis was based around my faith and relationship with Jesus and felt like an attack on my faith and as I had begun to question my salvation by the end of 2022 hearing this meant EVERYTHING to me. 

It was like this heavy weight immediately lifted and my confidence as God’s child was restored. It was a beautiful and loving message of the Father’s love for His children. 

I began regularly listening and believing in these messages and that they were for me as well as her other subscribers. But as she began to speak more about walking in the Spirit; listening to His instruction and learning how He speaks personally to you, I began to have the same concerns after a few months because although I began experiencing some external signs and experiencing even some physical sensations that I was believing were God’s speaking to me, there was still no intimacy — fellowship. There would be videos where she would ask the Holy Spirit to touch those listening and she frequently would feel the Holy Spirit’s power overcome her. She had even become overcome many times at her home and church and would find herself laying on the floor. I would never feel anything during any of these types of videos but she was so loving and comforting and I would find myself returning every couple of weeks. Then I stopped for a few months, I believe beginning mid summer of last year.

I then recall talking to God one day — heavenly Father — and saying that I thought before that He had promised not to leave me as an orphan as I had been feeling closer to Him in 2024 due to all the synchronicities that I mentioned and had been left absolutely confused by why He would allow me to believe these were from Him if they were not and that I felt completely abandoned and rejected. Within just an hour, I believe, I saw that she had posted a short video where she said she had a word of knowledge for someone from the Father. And then she spoke for Him referencing Isaiah 43:1 and saying, “I did not leave you as an orphan. I did not abandon you. I have not rejected you. I know you by name. You are mine says our Lord” 

Then I think about a week later I reached out and commented on the video. I don’t know why I didn’t tell her that I had stopped everything a couple months earlier but that these were the things I had been doing up until that point?? I think I was just so terribly beyond exhausted by this point.

This was what I wrote in the comment section:

“XXXXX,  I was so sure that this was a word for me as it came out within hours of my talking to God about how I felt like He had left me as an orphan and had been feeling both abandoned and rejected for months leading up to this. But, I am still not experiencing any intimacy or fellowship with the Lord and am a complete loss. I'm scared and I don't understand why this has happened. I know you don't have email and I apologize if this is too much -- my sharing here -- but I don't know what to do. So many times I've thought I've finally broken through whatever is blocking me from a relationship with God but He is just absent. I've prayed every prayer; repented of what I know to; prayed for grace to be obedient to His commands and for healing in the areas that may be holding me back from doing so.... daily reading my Bible; worship; praying/talking to God throughout the day; seeking His personal direction and insight and praying for His will to be done. Could I please ask for your prayer? I feel left behind and I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

She replied with: 

“You aren't doing anything wrong. I hear by the Spirit there is a demon causing you to feel 'distant' from Father when you are not. Break agreements with the lie. It's not truth. Command the realms of darkness causing you to feel distant to go from you! Lying demon! Speaking such a lie, making you feel that way! Hear the truth, Father is right there with you, loving you. Nothing is separating you or blocking you from Him. Rest now.. don't try to get close, it's a yielding within your heart, loving Him.. Him loving you. He is with you. 🩷🩷🩷”

Then a couple of weeks ago I reached out to her after she posted something and I was replying to that. I shared much more in a comment that was a few paragraphs long and she replied in great detail. She said that as she sat with the Lord regarding me, she saw in the Spirit that I was alone and that I felt alone and that the Spirit came upon her as she felt God’s immense love for me and it made her cry. She then said she heard Father say, “This is my daughter”, referring to me, and that she saw Jesus beside me holding me close with His arm around me. She said in bold letters, “YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD”  and this is typical demonic manifestation.” And she said that if I was hearing lies that I was not chosen, not saved, etc., and making me doubt my salvation that these were lies and indicators  that I was God’s child — I’m paraphrasing the last part. Then she said, “You are my sister and I love you.” And she shared a link to a list of deliverance prayers. Many, of which, I had already prayed in the past. 

I’ve tried so hard to hold onto what she shared. But I am utterly confused by it because I although I know that  have been under such attack spiritually it hasn’t helped when I’ve tried self deliverance prayers, nor when listening to her doing online deliverance in her videos. 

Also, for over nine months mostly beginning in January of 2024 following witnessing a hand to hand transfer  of a large stack of bills in front of my apartment to a resident while washing my exterior windows, which I knew had to be pointing to illegal activity, I began being relentlessly harassed and physically intimidated — both covertly, as well as overtly, at times, where I currently live by other tenants in my building which created a hyper vigilance and trigger response. It involved constant slamming of both individual apartment doors by several residents as well as the already heavy building entrance door and for hours daily while running back & forth past my windows and laughing, as well as encouraging their dogs to bark while both entering & exiting the building beside my apartment; flooding my bathroom three times from the unit above me; false allegations, and even more. All without initial provocation. I had never experienced anything like this in my three previous years of living here. Although others were also affected by at least two of the tenants’ behavior, I seemed to be the main target. By this time I had come across one YouTube channel, in particular, that was hosted by a young Christian woman of, I believe, Jamaican descent whose ministry was in large part focused on educating people in the world of witchcraft; and black magic and voodoo. She had family members who had used this against her including her own mother who tried to kill her using it. And she provided information regarding what symptoms to look out for as well as to how to pray against it, etc. She also had a prophetic gifting and words of knowledge for listeners. 

All of this erratic behavior by my neighbors was, without a doubt, demonically inspired and the more I would pray against it I had two disturbing dreams involving one of the young women along with one dream involving another neighbor who I had recently met who moved in beside me who not only smoked but kept trying to tempt me to drink with her, despite my sharing that I no longer do (as I self medicated for many years with both alcohol and cigarettes and credited God with finally delivering me from both). I also had one dream where I saw a black demon with red eyes wearing a black hood in front/across from my coffee table as he flipped it over toward me. I had been randomly sharing a video by Sidewalk Prophets, called “Come To the Table” on several  secular music Facebook pages, including some very dark — including Motley Crüe’s because the song seemed well-suited (which you’ll understand while listening to it). And I have no doubt that this latter dream came as a result of this.

All throughout I kept documenting and reporting the harrasment to the leasing office team and management. I even reached out to the police twice and they told me that unless physically attacked there was nothing they could do. For the most part as I mentioned elsewhere, I felt the Lord was with me through a lot of this but there were definite times where I was terrified, often at night because like clockwork someone or more than one person would seem to come out after midnight  and even around 3:00 a.m. and walk around outside my windows. I had such a strong suspicion that witchcraft was being performed on me and had been attempting to also pray against this as I mention above. 

The “ring leaders” of all of this have since moved out and it has quieted down immensely. But I was left like a deer in headlights and now I have two men living above me who just seem off. They are both Russian, I believe — one has several small black markings/tattoos and looks to be in his 20s and was rude when introducing myself and the other who eventually moved in looks to be in his 50s. One, or both, of them seems to almost always be home. I never hear the normal sounds of using their kitchen; shower; cleaning; watching tv; having company (apart from maybe once?) and occasionally hear them talking in Russian. After they moved in I began hearing obnoxiously loud sawing and drilling above me as if they had entered into the space between my ceiling and their floor and/or into the wall. I could hear a “tinny” sound of someone knocking into/hitting old ductwork or metal and not the typical sounds expected after someone had moved in and is putting up shelves or hammering, etc. I reported it because it was really odd and it happened more than just once. Soon after I began noticing a strong but quiet and rhythmic vibrational sensation that would keep me awake when my head was on my pillow as it would permeate my bed and couch. I began to feel it in my chest and it would increase tinnitus and was awful. I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from but then discovered something called a “ceiling thumper” that people can purchase to harass neighbors. I thought this must be what was coming from upstairs or something similar (because the vibrations can travel both through walls and/or floors and ceilings. They are not illegal but can seriously effect both someone’s physical and mental health. I also began moving around quietly because it seemed if I made any noise like watching tv or turning on my radio they would begin suddenly talking loudly. If I drew any attention to being an a particular room one of them would follow me and be directly above me in their apartment. It feels almost suffocating. They began to come down and smoke directly outside my apartment on the rare occasion. Within just the last two weeks it had suddenly become daily following my reaching out to the leasing office because of the smoke coming through my windows. It is a smoke free property and no one is permitted to smoke within 25 of the building. It feels line soft stalking, in a way. I have been assaulted by men in the past and this frightens me but I am pretty much trapped living here and cannot move.
 
Since September I was continuing to see many of these afore-mentioned number patterns daily for several months but they began to dwindle off. Eventually I began to only see mostly 1:11 or 11:11 and then 10:10; and I believe it is the devil trying to taunt me with the first part of John 10:10. 

However, I did start seeing both 3:16 and 3:17 which I wasn’t before, which brings John 3:16 & 17 to mind.

Natural energy shots (brands like So Good So You, Vive, etc) - These are SO expensive though to have often

Pre-Work Out - Makes me way to jittery and makes me crash later in the day

Black Coffee - Causes gastro-issues if I have before a work out

Energy Drinks - So much carbonation right before a workout hurts my stomach! And not as quick, takes time to drink

Any suggestions? I feel like the best outcomes I've had were with those natural energy shots.

Have a sip of coffee (you'll come back and finish it after chores). Head to the barn, and don't forget the bag of halters you bought on a whim yesterday. 

  
Feed the goats and turn them out. Realize that instead of the bag of halters, you brought the bag of bubble bath your friend gave you from the house. Grab the bag to go swap it, and immediately drop it on the cement floor of the barn. Realize your friend got you the ""fancy"" bubble bath which comes in a liter sized GLASS bottle (who comes up with this crap). Cry (just a little bit). Decide its high time to clean the barn anyway. Clean out all the shavings and poo from the stalls. Get distracted cause you see cobwebs and decide to clean the rafters and walls of the barn. Finish mucking the stalls. Decide to soak the buckets too while you're at it. Start hosing down the aisle of the barn and create rose and lavender scented bubble chaos. Make enough noise swearing at yourself that the nosey goats come say hi. Change the hose to the mist function to gently shoo them out. Realize they love it and spend 20 min just absolutely soaking them (weird weird goats, but its 90F outside). When they finally decide to leave, realize you are sweating balls and the mist function feels great on you too. Get soaked. See the bubbles on the floor and remember why you are there. Keep hosing and sweeping the water out. Spend an hour doing this until you remember your grandfather gave you a pressure washer for your birthday this year. Spend another 30 min figuring out how it works. FINALLY get all the water and the bubbles out of the barn. 

  
Go back to the house and realize the house smells bad (prob cause the barn now smells of rose and lavender) and hyperfixate on cleaning the house. Get distracted several times and just create a bigger mess. Look outside and see the buckets you left soaking outside. Go back to the barn to scrub and replace them. 

  
Realize you are soaking wet, can still smell the bubble bath for some reason, are exhausted, and haven't finished your coffee from this morning.

Sorry it's a bit long. Y'all know we be over explaining. 

I've never been in a real relationship for so many reasons, but as a preteen/early teen I was chastised for writing a letter to someone I had a crush on, totally innocent, and mailed it to him (wayyy before I realized I was sapphic). Anyway, I was made to feel shame about it and that being something I couldn't just do. As an adult, I've noticed friends/family reacting weirdly when I tell them I've reached out to people I don't know and shared that I appreciate their work/maybe tried to have coffee or something when we're in the same city to chat more. I could tell that they thought that was inappropriate/strange, but they didn't say it outright.

I have a very close friend who had a similar experience in high school as I did in middle school, but for her it was a positive thing. I don't think the guy she had a crush on reciprocated her feelings, but he appreciated the gesture and thought it was sweet. They had a super affable relationship after that. She's not autistic I don't think, but she is definitely neurodivergent. Recently, she was told by someone she's romantically interested in (has been for years) and who she thought she'd built a rapport/friendship with that he always got stalker vibes from her and she made him uncomfortable, so he just faked being nice, which gave her completely the wrong signals. She was blindsided by this conversation (they just spent almost two weeks together in a group setting and everything seemed great). Also, other people in the group are baffled by this conversation/his reaction, so it's not just her who is confused. She's just a really sweet, caring, and considerate person. She loves people and builds relationships with others easy.

  
Her experience reminded me of other potential romantic interests I've had in the past, and it seems that these things that we (as neurodivergents) do as friends are seen as super thoughtful, considerate, and caring, but when it's someone we're potentially romantically interested in, it's creepy. We know too much about them, we do too much/come on too strong, and to us it's just like, uhm, you explicitly said a thing about you and I remembered it? So, I thought you might like this thing related to an interest that we previously discussed? Just being thoughtful. Oh, I'm actually a creepy stalker? Cool. Cool. Cool. Got it. Catch me never speaking to anyone ever again.

  
Have y'all had similar experiences? How do you deal with that? I've given up on trying to find anyone to date (for many reasons, some unrelated to this) but I'm still curious and confused about how to approach/think about those kinds of things now. It's kind of just reinforced my stance that people are largely trash and it's not worth it to even try.",1,1746633898.0,AutismInWomen,0,0.99,False
1kh13ro,https://i.redd.it/69gxsq5crdze1.png,"As I've been rewatching the movies as the release for 'Bloodlines' gets closer, I've come to appreciate the Metaphysical vibe that they have unlike other horror and slasher movies","'Halloween', 'Friday the 13th', and 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' are typical slashers. 'Scream' is popular for being self-aware and knowing the rules of a slasher movie. But as I've been rewatching the 'Final Destination' films, I love the metaphysical aspect and vibe that they have which is unlike others which actually starts to make you question your own life and mortality. 

""How do we know that just by crossing the street, or sipping this coffee, or breathing the air that we haven't started in motion the chain of events that will someday lead to our death 10 years from now, one year from now, or tomorrow?"". If you've ever gotten into a car accident, you immediately start questioning ""If I had just left the house 5 minutes earlier or 5 minutes later, I wouldn't have gotten into this accident"". But all the times that we drive without getting into an accident, what if one of those times we did leave 5 minutes earlier and were involved in an accident that ends up killing us? 

Not only that, but when confronted with the fact that you will die very soon, how do you handle your own death? Like when Rory is asking Kimberly ""When I die, is it gonna hurt?"". Or will you just accept it like Nora  (""If it's my time to go and be in Heaven with my family, I can accept that"")? Or rage in denial like Carter or Eugene? And if you are aware that life is fleeting, do you play it safe and lock yourself in a padded room, or try to live life to the fullest? 

Does anyone else view these movies as a bit deeper than a typical slasher as well?

1kh13ki,https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningTrainingShoes/comments/1kh13ki/explore_nike_mens_sneaker_review_are_these_the/,Explore Nike Men's Sneaker Review Are These the Ultimate Stylish and Comfortable Trainers?,"Nike has always been a name synonymous with quality and style, so stepping into their Nike Court Royale Men’s Sneakers (B0B4VRYV3Y) felt like slipping into a blend of comfort and retro coolness. Designed with everyday practicality and flair in mind, these shoes caught my attention not just for their visual appeal but for their practical features as well. After wearing them around for a couple of weeks, I realized there were a few layers to unravel—both good and bad. Here's my take as someone who values both fashion and function when it comes to sneakers.

**Style Meets Simplicity**  
The sneakers boast a sleek retro vibe that seems to blend seamlessly into almost any wardrobe. Their synthetic leather outer material gives off a polished, low-key look, while the rounded toe box and clean stitching accentuate the minimalistic design. What I appreciated most was how suited they were for nearly everything—whether it was a coffee run, casual workday, or just chilling at the park. The chunky molded outsole adds a bit of noticeable retro charm, reminding me of the classic basketball sneakers from the '80s. If style versatility is your thing, these might be a match, especially with their subtle branding that keeps things stylish yet understated.

**Comfort That Grows on You**  
The padded ankle collar instantly stood out to me; my heels and Achilles felt cradled, not scratched, like some cheaper sneakers sometimes do. The insole is cushioned and makes standing for longer periods tolerable, though I wouldn’t say it’s made for all-day athletic activities. I wore them for grocery shopping and walking across the city, and they held up decently. However, I couldn’t help but wish for a tad more arch support for those longer treks. 

[Check Nike Court Royale price on Amazon.](https://crosner.com/p/b00q6zbub6/)

**Durability That (Mostly) Shines Through**  
Synthetic leather tends to spark mixed feelings, but these sneakers surprised me. I expected visible creasing after frequent wear, but they’ve held their shape fairly well. The herringbone-patterned outsole truly impressed me—it grips like a champ on smooth and slightly slippery surfaces. Whether I was dodging spills in the kitchen or walking on wet pavements, traction wasn’t an issue. However, I did notice some minor scuffing on the outer material, especially after biking in them. This might be something to keep in mind if you’re rougher on your shoes.

**Advantages**  
- The retro-style design makes them effortlessly versatile for casual wear.  
- Cushioned insole and padded ankle collar provide appreciable comfort.  
- Grip is highly reliable, even on slick surfaces.  
- The molded chunky rubber outsole doesn’t just look good; it adds traction.  

**Flaws**  
- Synthetic leather shows mild scuffing with regular use.  
- Could use more support for extended walks or standing.  
- Breathability is hit or miss on hotter days.  

**Fit and Functionality for Different Users**  
Sizing seemed true to form—mine fit snug yet not suffocating. Wide-footed individuals might find these a little narrow initially, though they seemed to relax a bit after a week of breaking in. I let a coworker, who typically avoids lace-ups, try them on, and his exact words were, “These laces actually stay tied, which is rare for me!” The lace-up closure feels secure without turning into an adjustment marathon. 

**Product Contenders**  
While the Court Royale sneakers shine in style, competing brands have their say, too. Adidas’ Gazelle sneakers hold a similar fashion-forward appeal but come with true leather material, boosting durability but hiking up costs. On the other hand, Puma’s Smash Vulc sneakers, while also packing comfort, lacked the traction I found in Court Royale's herringbone outsole. However, Puma undercuts the price point slightly. These Nike sneakers excel in a blend of simplicity and functionality, though if your primary focus is long-term comfort, you may want to consider Sketchers’ range of memory-foam sneakers.

**True Value**  
It’s fair to say these sneakers hit a sweet spot between affordability and practicality. They’re not aiming for premium leather sneaker territory, nor do they shy away from standing their ground with features like comfortable cushioning and durable outsoles. Compared to pricier counterparts, the Court Royale sneakers deliver upscale looks at an accessible rate. For anyone looking for everyday sneakers that don’t compromise on style or usability, they’re worth checking out.

1kh0waa,https://www.reddit.com/r/realWorldPrepping/comments/1kh0waa/in_praise_of_composting_via_a_digester_biogas_and/,In praise of composting via a digester (biogas and fertilizer),"City dwellers can skip this one (anaerobic composting with a water based digester doesn't smell so good.) Ditto cold climate folk.

Elsewhere in this sub I have a review of the specific biogas digester I bought. It's a very negative review because assembly was really pretty horrific for what should have been a simple kit. Read it if you're curious.

But I've been running it now for a number of months. And it works. So this is in praise of the concept, if you can find a manufacturer that gets consistently good reviews, to buy from.

Up front: this is a very large bag of water into which you shove selected organic inputs, and it wants a temperature year round of 90F. It is ideal for the tropics. Lower temperatures at night are ok (it gets down to 68F here at times) and higher is fine (it can get to 100F here). In colder climates you'd need to warm the water, which probably isn't an environmental or cost win.

But in my two person household, we produce enough kitchen scraps to produce enough methane to cook one meal a day and sometimes more, like a pot of coffee. We don't produce enough to do all our cooking on it; specifically, I don't get enough to cook a full meal and pasteurize a gallon of raw milk, which would have been perfect.

The other output is a liquid which smells about like what you'd expect but a bit worse, but having worked with it, it's effective fertilizer (I usually cut it with some water). It has made a difference for the garden.

Things you can compost:   
fruit waste, but not citrus  
Unsalted liquid whey  
vegetable waste (but seeds and stems break down slowly)  
coffee grounds (in moderation)  
eggshell (and these are important, or the mix gets too acidic)  
meat (in moderation)  
sugar water (leftovers from our hummingbird feeder)  
output from your toilet - urine is good - if you don't involve cleaning chemicals.  
manure

In a typical day (I feed it daily because our small compost bin fills up just about daily) there might be three eggshells, coffee grounds from 2 pots of coffee (yeah, for two people), a handful of mango and papaya waste, waste from peppers, small amounts of fat from chicken, any excess whey we produce from making yogurt (not much - I cook with whey), and about an equivalent amount of water to wash it down. 

On the No list:  
citrus, salt, strong acids - halts decomposition  
lots of leaves - decomposes too slowly, clogs things.  
bones - dissolves very slowly, doesn't provide much buffering.  
The manufacturer says no grass clippings. I think they are ok in small amounts.

Cooking over methane is like cooking over propane - slightly less energy output, which is good because some propane stoves burn too hot to allow for simmering, but my methane stove manages it fine. 

Basically, this saves you a little electricity or propane, gets you some decent fertilizer, and is an overall win for the environment - food you throw out or compost in the ground releases methane, which is a very potent greenhouse gas; burning it by cooking with it converts it to much less damaging gasses. 

Having studied the design on mine a bit, I'd decided that this isn't a thing you cobble together on your own. Some engineering went into figuring out how to collect and purify the methane, and the tubes and pipes have specific placement to prevent air from interfering with the process. This is a case where a decent kit is worth it. 

Also note that if you're doing this only to save money, it's not that great a deal. There's no cost once it's running, but the kits tend to cost a lot and what you save in propane (I can cook for over 3 months here on $15 of propane and $10 of electricity) doesn't amount to much. But it's far more convenient (dumping in compost just takes a minute, digging and turning over a compost pit on a tropical morning much more work.) For me, the big win is avoiding maintaining a compost pit, plus the environmental advantages, and the fact that cooking over methane is a little more controllable than cooking over propane. Of course, if you're entirely off grid, being able to squeeze a meal or maybe two from it a day is a big deal (and way better than cooking over wood.) ",1,1746633402.0,realWorldPrepping,0,1.0,False

Uber’s Bold Q2 Bet Outshines Q1 Miss, But Investors Hit the Brakes

https://preview.redd.it/r69d6oqntdze1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=027cc01a6315d8cfffe4c879e6781073d62a483e

Buckle up, folks—Uber’s latest earnings report is a wild ride, blending upbeat forecasts with a stock price that’s skidding like a rideshare in a rainstorm. Despite a mixed Q1 and a backdrop of trade tariff turbulence, Uber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi is steering the company with the confidence of a driver dodging rush-hour traffic. But Wall Street? It’s hitting the brakes, sending Uber’s stock down 2% in premarket trading. So, what’s the deal?

Uber’s Q1 numbers were a bit like ordering a latte and getting a flat white—close, but not quite there. Gross bookings hit $42.8 billion, shy of the $43.1 billion Bloomberg consensus, though still up a respectable 18% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA, however, flexed some muscle at $1.9 billion, topping estimates of $1.84 billion and soaring 35% from last year. Not too shabby for a company navigating a “dizzying backdrop” of trade wars and economic policy ping-pong, as Khosrowshahi put it.

The real horsepower came in Uber’s Q2 outlook, which had analysts raising their coffee cups. The company projects gross bookings between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion—smack in line with or above the $45.85 billion expected—and adjusted EBITDA of $2.02 billion to $2.12 billion, edging out the $2.05 billion forecast. Translation? Uber’s core ride-hailing (up 15%) and delivery (up 18%) businesses are humming, even if freight took a 2% detour. Monthly active platform consumers grew 14% to 170 million, proving users are still tapping that app like it’s a morning ritual.

So why the stock drop? Investors, it seems, wanted a five-star quarter, not a four-and-a-half. “The market’s acting like it ordered an Uber Black and got an UberX,” quipped one trader. Despite Uber’s $2 billion in quarterly free cash flow and CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah’s boast of “industry-leading cash flow growth,” Wall Street’s expectations were riding shotgun with loftier dreams.

Khosrowshahi, undeterred, is already eyeing the horizon—specifically, the driverless kind. “We’re building towards the future,” he declared, touting five new autonomous vehicle deals in the past week alone. Uber’s partnership with Waymo is cruising in Atlanta and Austin, while a beefed-up deal with WeRide will roll out robotaxis in 15 cities globally over five years, from Abu Dhabi to Europe. Not to be outdone, Pony AI’s robotaxis are saddling up for Uber’s platform in the Middle East. It’s a bold bet that the future of mobility is less “human driver” and more “HAL 9000 with wheels.”

But let’s not ignore the elephant in the room—or the tariff in the trade war. While Uber didn’t explicitly cry foul over President Trump’s economic policies, a weaker consumer could dent demand for rides and deliveries. Khosrowshahi’s “strong start to the year” mantra might face headwinds if wallets tighten. Still, with user retention climbing and cash flow gushing, Uber’s got more than a few gears to shift.

As the market digests this report, one thing’s clear: Uber’s driving forward, even if Wall Street’s temporarily riding in the backseat, grumbling about the fare.",2,1746633344.0,Junior_Stocks,0,1.0,False

I'm someone who's recently been introduced to the joy of making coffee from whole beans, and I’m truly enjoying the journey of exploring flavors, rituals, and origins.

At the moment, I’m seeking premium-quality, single-origin coffee beans — something thoughtful and refined. Something truly tasteful, steeped in elegance — the kind of brew that whispers warmth to the souls of those I hold dear.

1. Arabica – Medium Roast


2. Excelsa – Medium Roast


3. Liberica – Dark Roast

The beans must be single origin, not blends or mixed varieties.

I’m looking for whole beans, not pre-ground.

Roast consistency and flavor integrity are important to me.

I answered that, unfortunately, we don't have real networking. People are not ready to share ideas and experiences. If someone opens a store, after some time, the same one will definitely open nearby. Therefore, no matter how absurd it may sound: real networking in our country exists only among a narrow circle of acquaintances))

I want to change this and see a networking culture in Samarkand, like in Europe. A place where people from different fields and industries can exchange ideas, discuss projects and find inspiration, just chatting over a cup of coffee or a glass of something stronger.

Networking is not about the number of people on Contact list, but how many of them can really help you. A new look at familiar things, useful tips and unexpected solutions - that's what matters.

The Ember Mug: it’s pricey but so worth it and she’ll love for you forever if she’s a coffee or tea drinker. Every new mom knows how much you don’t get to enjoy your coffee and end up reheating no short of 3 times before you just give up. This keeps her coffee/tea nice and hot and she can set her desired temperature. I love this thing, it’s amazing. 

New books: whether it’s physical books, ebooks or audio books if she’s a book lover then this is an absolutely great gift, especially if she’s breastfeeding or doing late nights and needs something to pass the time. 

A nice bottle of wine: because what mom doesn’t need a glass or 3 from time to time 🤪

Purses: I’m a big purse girlie, especially of kate spade so my husband got me a new bag one time and it was so appreciated and sweet. Even better right now they’re running an amazing deal on their outlet store! 

The ability to do nothing: this doesn’t mean you just do everything physical for baby/kids but actually taking on the mental load for the day. Planning the meals and executing, taking care of baby in every part, not asking “what do you wanna do today” but instead plan something you’ll know she loves without even having to ask. 

Flowers: the tried and true. I really don’t know too many women who don’t love flowers. Go get her a bouquet of her favorite flowers plus her favorite candy!

It was basically abandoned with lots of random stuff in it, but nothing a good clean couldn't sort out. It was £1,500 - a decent sum, but relatively cheap considering the 2 bedrooms and great view etc.

Alas - while there is a wood burner, there's no generator or gas at the minute, and certainly no solar. Thankfully it's hooked up to water etc.

For now, this is all no big deal and we're treating it as a little knock about for the summer. We have a little gas cooker to use outside (hooked up to the small camping gas cartridges), and the place is plenty warm anyway with all the current sunshine. I can bring down a decent flask from home to make tea/coffee or just boil some water etc.

But I would like to go down to the caravan (10-20 minutes from home) to go and work on my computer in the day time. I have internet via a dongle. But my work mac dies after only 1-2 hours use, and I can't modify it anyway.

A normal work day is 8 or hours or so. With the caravan being down a precarious track I'd like a battery solution that I can hook up to that is *just* enough to do this without nipping home. Anything more would be a bonus.

Finances are tight, and the caravan was a bit of an impulse buy, and so I'm looking to buy something here in the UK, ideally with delivery without breaking the bank (i.e no more than a few hundred pounds).

I'm utterly overwhelmed reading/looking online. I did originally think of solar + battery, but my guess from what I have understood is that I'm better off just getting a battery I can charge at home, given the limited budget.

Advice welcome - and sorry for long spiel. I'll continue to search for relevant posts now...

They think the key to higher conversions lies in improving their “sales script” or “follow-up funnel,” when in fact, their real problem started way before the conversation even began.

They're talking to the wrong damn people.

Before you can attract the appropriate prospects, the kind of customer who says, “this was made for me”, you have to ruthlessly, deliberately, and strategically **screen out** the inappropriate ones.

That requires something most don’t have the guts or structure to implement.

I call it a place strategy. I borrowed the term from a long-time member of ours, Steven Ruark, who got it from real estate. It simply means being in the right pond to begin with.

And let me be blunt: most people are fishing in septic tanks and wondering why they don’t catch anything worth scaling.

Take a university as an example. Harvard Business Review is not the right place for High Point University to run an ad. The readers of HBR want their kids in Yale, Princeton, or Harvard.

That’s not just a different pond, it’s a different planet.

Forbes, on the other hand, might be a better shot.

Same goes for a guy who worked twenty years as a mechanic, finally opens his own shop, and wants to avoid a commute, so he opens in his own neighborhood without checking whether he’s surrounded by DIY dads with oil-stained driveways and socket wrench sets older than their kids.

If your customer wants to hand off the keys and say, “I don’t want to look under the hood, just make it run,” then you better not set up shop where everyone’s tightening their own lug nuts.

Place matters. Deeply.

But that’s just the start.

You also need courage—**reasoned courage**—to say who you want and who you don’t. That’s real marketing. It’s not “for everybody.”

High Point University, for instance, doesn’t just let anyone waltz through the door. They have what they call an “appropriateness quiz” for the parents and the students. And yes, it’s rigged not in a dishonest way, but in a precise, engineered way to show exactly who this is for and who it most certainly is not.

If your top priority is keg stands and frat parties, they’ll politely but firmly suggest you look into Arizona State.

That’s not snobbery. That’s smart positioning.

That’s how you attract the right people by pushing away the wrong ones.

And here’s the thing: when you do this right, you’re not excluding money. You’re magnetizing it.

Look at Fisher Investments. “If you don’t have $500,000 in retirement savings, don’t call us.” That’s not arrogance. That’s clarity. It says, “We’re not trying to be all things to all people.”

And because they say that, they become everything to the people they are right for.

The secret to building a powerful business is to be deeply meaningful to a narrowly appropriate audience.

You can’t do that if you’re bending over backwards for people who aren’t even a fit to begin with.

Of course, doing this requires deal flow.

You can’t have the courage to repel people if you’re terrified of losing every lead. The only way to stop being afraid of filtering out the bad is to have enough good flowing in.

So now we get to the next big flaw in most marketing efforts: **no process.**

Randomness is the enemy.

Most people throw bait into the water and pray that wine and fishes float to the top. You need a step-by-step system to move someone from vaguely interested to fully informed and asking for the sales conversation.

Let me give it to you straight: compress that path and everything gets harder. Stretch it and everything gets easier.

You should never be trying to “close” cold leads.

Instead, you should be moving them through a series of intentional steps. First, they notice you. Then they raise their hand. Then they’re asked a few questions that help them self-select. Then, if they stick, they receive more information. Then they apply. Then and only then, do you invite them into a serious conversation.

That’s not just sales. That’s intelligent, scalable, high-leverage selling.

And if you don’t like that process, that’s fine—create your own.

But stick to it. Refuse randomness.

Let’s talk media.

The purpose of media is not to replace work. It’s to eliminate **repetitive dumb work.**

Most people confuse the two.

Media should replace the endless monotony of saying the same damn thing over and over. It should be engineered to remove resistance, reinforce your authority, establish your believability, enhance your celebrity, and ideally position you so that you can prescribe, not pitch.

When your prospect finally gets to you, it should feel like they’re hoping you say yes to *them* not the other way around.

If you’re still chasing, pleading, “circling back,” your media isn’t doing its job.

And don’t be dogmatic about it.

Physical media, digital media—it all works. But the smartest strategy is to combine the two. A shock-and-awe box still works. A paid book offer still works.

Giving them the option to pay to get more information? That’s not just a tripwire offer, it’s a declaration of seriousness.

I once ran an infomercial for a home business product where people could order a free info kit, or they could pay $9.95 to get the full VHS package with an in-field demo.

Guess which leads converted better?

The ones who paid, by a mile.

You’re not just segmenting buyers, you’re *magnetizing believers.*

People who see themselves in the message.

That’s what it means to engineer appropriateness.

You cannot expect a 10-out-of-10 customer if you’re not willing to weed out the ones and twos.

The backbone of magnetic marketing is clarity, specificity, and a process that pre-sells so deeply that by the time they talk to you, they already want in.

They’re not asking for a deal. They’re asking for permission.

That’s the power position. And that’s the point.

So now, let’s take everything we just talked about and give you the actual blueprint to put it to work in your business starting this week.

This isn’t theory. It’s 40+ years of *in-the-trenches strategy*, boiled down into a field guide you can read in 10-minute chunks a day, while you drink your morning coffee or before bed.

If you're a plumber, café, dentist, or any local service, most of your customers are searching things like “plumber near me” or “best coffee in \[suburb\].” If your site and Google Business Profile are optimised, you can show up in those local results, **right when people are ready to buy or book**.

It works best when you:

* Set up and optimise your Google Business Profile
* Collect regular reviews
* Add local keywords to your site (like suburbs or city names)
* Ensure consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across directories

If you're not doing local SEO, you're missing out on people actively looking for exactly what you offer.

1kh0p3z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kh0p3z,Cala Lilly from Trader Joe’s.,"Idk what happened here. I was so excited to have a black Cala Lilly. Black plants are my favorite. I had this cauldron from my kids wizard birthday party and I used that to plant it. No drainage but I didn’t over water and I did put rocks in the bottom. 

Had all day light both direct and indirect. And a little shade. Humidity on point. My plant-reader-majig says it was all good. 

I tried fishtank water and rice water and coffee for the yellow leaves. Not all at once* I never kept it too wet but also didn’t let it dry so much that the dirt shrunk away from the sides of the pot. 

I thought maybe it needed a new pot and when I went to repot it it just…fell apart. Before I could get it out. All the leaves just pbthhhh. 

I’ve had plants spring back to life out of nowhere so I went ahead and left the roots in there and just put the pot on my very well lit humid indoor porch. 🤞

I am a 26 year old woman (normal height and weight, no hormonal issues, no chance of pregnancy, normal regular periods, I have a copper IUD). I've had yeast infections, BV, and UTIs in the past but never this horrible. I am desperate. No treatment has given me any relief and I've been dealing with symptoms since March 30. I feel a constant burning and prickling feeling inside my vagina. I also feel sore/ache down there like I've been punched. All I can do right now is cry and try not to itch myself raw. If anyone has any advice or suggestions please let me know.

Here is the timeline:

**March 30-April 10** \- I experienced UTI like symptoms (just burning when I peed) and was given Nitrofurantoin for 5 days. No improvement.

**April 10-April 30** \- My symptoms changed to BV like symptoms (burning and itching inside the whole vulva, burning when I peed, and a strange fishy/metallic smell). I was given Metronidazole for 7 days. There was slight improvement.

* I started taking a probiotic with cranberry and changed my diet to cut out sugar and coffee
* I tried boric acid and felt no improvement 

**April 18** \- My symptoms worsened again (4-5 discomfort). Burning and itching all the time and burning when I peed. I was tested for STIs, Yeast, BV, and UTI. Everything came back negative. I was given Cephalexin for 5 days. Still no improvement.  

**May 3** \- My symptoms got worse and I was tested again at a different clinic for everything. They found some yeast buds under the microscope. I was given two doses of Fluconazole. My physical exam was normal and my skin inside my vagina is not irritated.

## Key Features analysis

The stroller cup holder market offers a wide range of designs and functionalities.Features like universal compatibility, secure attachment, adequate capacity, and durable construction are crucial for a reliable and convenient experience.The best stroller cup holders combine these elements to keep drinks safe, accessible, and spill-free, making outings with children more enjoyable.

An adjustable design, such as a cup holder with expandable arms or a flexible silicone liner, enhances the versatility to accommodate different container sizes without compromising security. Generous depth is also essential to prevent taller bottles tipping.

**Durable & Weather-resistant Construction**

Durability is critical for a stroller accessory that will be exposed to the elements and subjected to frequent use.

She gave me 2 coupons: One for a bottle of water & another for a free coffee. I honestly felt repulsed at the thought of a private hospital being so stingy it offered me 1 bottle of water.

2. They asked me to buy gloves, masks & skull caps for them. Am I, the patient, supposed to ensure a clean setup? Is that not the hospital's responsibility in the very least?

3. The nurses act like they are doing you a favor. Downright rude, apathetic & ""my work here is done"" attitude. 

4. The infrastructure is a joke. They will not offer you a chair. How despicable is that? Just misery hanging around here.

I think the greatest motivation for me then was that my children deserved one sane parent and it looked like it was going to be me—if our family were to have any chance. I worked hard to become a better parent, and we all began to recover. It helped that three of my children went to Alateen.  
  
When I became stronger, and it looked like things were not going to improve in our household, my husband and I separated and later were divorced. Tough as things were trying to cope with raising five angry kids on my own, we not only survived, but we thrived.  
  
Sometime later, I married a wonderful man who also happened to be a member of Al-Anon. We were all very happy. The children loved him; they grew up and became fine young adults, and all went relatively well for quite a few years. However, my husband became ill and was eventually wheelchair bound. It was such a great gift that we both had a program to live by and we kept that in mind. So often, when things were really difficult, we would use the slogans to guide us and encourage us. The little bookmark Just for Today (M-10) was also so helpful; we often quoted, “I can do something for 12 hours that would appall me if I felt I had to keep it up for a lifetime.”  
  
My husband required care around the clock, and I had not been able to attend meetings. Friends in the program would occasionally come to our home and hold a meeting for us, and these meetings were a Godsend.  
  
Eventually my husband died, and I was faced with yet another challenge: how to go on with my life. It was a brand new experience to have no one to care for except myself—and it was scary! One of the first things I did was to go back to my Al-Anon meetings. It was as if they were waiting for me!  
  
This brings me to the question I mentioned at the beginning: Why do I still go to those meetings? The biggest reason is that I’m still alive and I never want to forget all the lessons I’ve learned in the program. It is truly a program for living. Also, once in a while I hear a real gem that is shared that stays with me, and I don’t want to miss those little pearls of wisdom.  
  
Last but not least, what would happen if there were no one to greet the newcomer who is hurting, needs encouragement, and someone to say, “You’re in the right place”? I’ll never forget the feeling when I was a newcomer and a member sat me down, put her arm around my shoulder, and brought me a cup of coffee. Someone was there for me. Can I do less?

1kh0dbx,https://i.redd.it/vh0b0vt1ldze1.jpeg,Newbie Help - How to approach this cherry table?,"Hello, I have some experience with finishing hardwood in general, but not restoration. I snagged this damaged coffee table (one leg broken at the joint) off of facebook marketplace and would like to try to restore the top, detach it, and use it on a different project.

I have a couple questions before I just dive in and potentially ruin it: 

1.  Is there any shot this is veneer? The legs and apron are definitely cherry, but the grain on the top seems maybe too perfect to be real?  I was thinking of sanding down a section of the underside to see. It's only about .5in thick and the edges are very dark, so I think I would have to sand into the stain in order to get a better look at the edge grain. Is there a better way to check?

  
2. Assuming it's not veneer, should I try and keep the stain intact and just sand off the topcoat(s)? Is that possible without taking some stain with it?

  
3. If it's inevitable that I will take off some of the stain with removing the finish, any clue of what color/type of stain I would be looking for to touch it up?

  
4. My tentative plan was to make a first pass with a random orbital sander at 400 grit and see how it looks, and then either go up or down in grit from there. Is that a safe starting point?

  
5. Finally, if it is in fact veneer -- am I toast? haha

Just tossing this out there - anyone else in Punggol feel like job hunting is 10x harder when you’re doing it alone on your couch in PJs? 😅 I’ve realized that left to my own devices, I’ll just refresh job portals, snack endlessly, and somehow send out exactly ZERO applications by the end of the night.

So I’m thinking… maybe we squad up? Like a mini job hunt crew. Meet up somewhere, open our laptops, sip on budget-friendly drinks (or not-so-budget ones), and hold each other accountable while applying for jobs. Basically, co-working for the unemployed and fabulous.

If that sounds like your vibe, reply here or shoot me a PM and we’ll figure out a meetup. Doesn’t have to be smack in Punggol - somewhere nearby works too!

A few places I scoped out:

Coffee Bean @ Waterway Point - Open late! Downside: occasional “bonus soundtrack” from renovation drills.

One Punggol Library Café – $2.50 drinks that might give you a sugar rush and diabetes. Closes around 8:30 PM though.

Picnic tables at One Punggol – Surprisingly breezy and pretty chill for working outdoors.

My (42M Caucasian) BMI was then 33.4 I'm 6ft 3in and was hovering around 253-ish pounds. He wants me to exercise and hes right, I should have. However my heart actually hurts when I get my heart rate up. I've been telling him this and his answer, you guessed it, cause I'm to fat. Now he didn't say that quite so succinctly I am paraphrasing a 30 minute conversation.

I was trying to convey that the fat is a symptom of the pain. He doesn't see it that way, the pain is because of the fat in his mind. Later that day I talked with my GP (had both appointments lined up like a boss)!!! With my GPs assistance I've gotten a pretty severe intermittent fasting schedule.... he suggested about 1300 or so calories.... but he stressed just how rough that is on the body. Supplements were suggested and all the appropriate medical knowledge was given.

The goal is 195 lbs, the higher end of his BMI chart for my height. I see him for a 6 month follow up and I am so scared... I have put in so much work and basically starved myself.... I'm stressing the weight of my freaking shoes and pants... I almost wanna go in a swimming suit.

I look at my scale twice a week... my last 3 checks have me at 207!!! I can't seem to move past it now. What's worse, I'm so hungry. I took a few (5) tootsie rolls from my wife's secret stash (its not at all a secret its literally on top the coffee table). And I feel guilty... I had a can of 100% pineapple juice 140 cals and my brain is telling me (this is why you're a fat fuck)!

I just want this diet over with. I want to do the check in in June and be at the weight I need to be so I can go on a maintenance amount of incoming calories (should be about 1900-2100 or so).

Can the void offer me some words of wisdom to help me push past 207... it is vital that I get there to shut up my cardiologist on the 22nd of june.",1,1746632032.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,0.67,False

That’s more than enough to get started. You don’t need fancy software, ads, or a big following to make your first $500 selling an ebook. You just need a plan, hustle, and a little creativity.

Here’s how to do it step by step:


1. Create a High-Value Ebook (Free Tools Only)

Pick a problem and solve it. Your ebook should help people do something better or faster: think “How to Meal Prep for Beginners” or “Freelancer’s Guide to Getting Clients.”

Write it in Google Docs. Free, clean, and easy to use.

Export it as a PDF. Done.

Design a cover on Canva (free version). Make it simple but clean use their templates.


2. Set the Right Price

Start with $10–$15. That means just 34–50 sales = $500.

Use the “pay what you want” option with a minimum of $10 some people will pay more to support you.

Make the value clear: what will people get from this ebook?


3. Spend Your $10 Wisely

Here’s how to stretch that $10:

$5 for a simple Fiverr gig – maybe a quick edit or feedback on your cover or copy.

$5 for a small Facebook/Instagram ad to a super targeted audience (optional—only if you have an ad-ready post and some experience).


Totally okay to skip ads and keep the $10 for coffee. The real growth comes from word of mouth and smart promo.


4. Launch Like You Mean It (For Free)

Promotion is where you win. Here’s how to go big without spending big:

Post on your socials and don’t just say “I wrote an ebook.” Say:

“Just launched a guide that helped me [lose weight for ex]—I turned it into a short ebook if anyone wants to do the same!”


Make 1–2 short videos (Instagram Reels, TikToks, Stories). People love quick tips, and then you drop: “I go deeper in my ebook—link in bio.”

DM 20 people you know who would benefit or support you. Not spam just genuine messages.

Share a behind-the-scenes look. Your writing process, your excitement, your first sale.


5. Keep Momentum All Week

Post daily with fresh angles: tips from the book, reviews, screenshots, wins.

Offer a free bonus for early buyers: a worksheet, checklist, or mini Q&A session.

Ask buyers to share it or tag you social proof builds fast.


You’re $500 Away From Proof That You Can Do This

You don’t need a team, a budget, or a big brand. You need:

A good idea

A simple PDF

The drive to talk about it like it matters—because it does

- reduce caffeine:  I drink a matcha latte first. And then if I really want coffee, I'll have coffee. But adding the green tea to reduce inflammation and caffeine is a start. Green tea has caffeine but not as much as coffee. I hope to eliminate coffee eventually, but it'll be gradual. 

- reduce alcohol: I drink herbal tea first. And then if I still want wine, I'll have it. But usually, I'll just head to bed after having my tea. Adding things is way easier than going cold turkey for me personally. 

- Fibroids could be linked to Vitamin D deficiency. So I started taking a Vitamin D supplement, 5000IU. 

- Citrus is correlated with preventing fibroids, so I'm trying to eat an orange or grapefruit everyday. 

Lastly, lifting weights and cardio has been SO hopeful. It reduces my bloating and my heavy bleeding. If I am too tired, I'll go for a walk. Last month, I bled for 3 weeks and it was a crime scene every single day. This month has been so much better. Still heavy, but not as bad as last month. 

Essentially, I've added two cups of tea, a vitamin D supplement, exercise, and citrus to my daily routine. 

Of course, do what's best for you and talk to your doctor. My own doctor was not very helpful which sucks, she told me to get a hysterectomy. Hence, the lifestyle changes. ",1,1746631994.0,Fibroids,1,0.99,False

A little lost on what to do here. I (25f) was in a relationship that I always perceived as loving and great with my boyfriend (32m). Then one day suddenly he asks to meet me at a coffee shop and tells me he needs space and doesn’t want to continue the relationship. He said he feels he needs to find himself and learn to feel emotions again because he’s been through some trauma in his lifetime. We both cry and part ways. I get drunk and text him the next night, and he tells me we should talk more. I get worried about him because he sends me a concerning text about crying and how everyone has to suffer from his actions. I go to his place to drop off a letter and tell him everything I’ve been feeling and that I want to talk more, and he just changes. He texts back that I’m unstable and I need to “get a grip” and that it’s creepy I’m at his apartment. He tells me that maybe fate will bring us together again one day but to let things play out and that we have our whole lives to figure out right and wrong. He told me to get a grip and leave him alone, using language that he’s never used with me before. He was so mean. He told me he was going to cut me out of his life and that I was becoming like a stalker ex. He also said he was tired of just feeling pity for me which would cause him to just continue making himself worse. I’m just so confused because it was all so sudden. Did I miss the signs that he wasn’t happy? He’s never spoken to me like this. We were talking about maybe moving in together or having kids one day. Shouldw I be genuinely concerned that he may be having a mental breakdown? Just so lost. He’s also been struggling with intense back pain recently and I don’t think that helps the situation. To make things worse, I found out I’m pregnant today. Do I tell him or just get rid of it? I’m afraid to raise a child with him if he can suddenly become this violent and angry. Please help.

He sighed dramatically. ""A few months. It just happened.""  
I stood, unable to stay in the bed we'd shared for eight years.  
""Jack? Your career high is 28 goals in a season. My grandfather made 28 million dollars last week."" I smiled sweetly. ""You've just made the biggest mistake of your life."" ———————— Emma Carter's butt had gone numb from sitting in the same cushioned seat for three hours. Not even the luxury boxes at Boston Arena had chairs comfortable enough for the marathon that was playoff hockey. The crowd roared as the final buzzer sounded—Boston Blades 3, Montreal 2.

She stood and stretched, watching as her husband Jack scored the winning goal in overtime. The fans stomped and chanted his name, their hero on ice. Emma smiled, genuinely happy for him despite everything else.

""Mrs. Reynolds? Would you like me to call your car?"" the suite attendant asked, already gathering her empty water bottles.

""Not yet, thanks. I'm heading down to congratulate the team."" Emma grabbed her purse, a simple leather tote that clashed hilariously with the designer outfits of the other hockey wives.

The attendant's smile tightened. ""Oh, I believe there's a private team celebration tonight. Players only.""

Emma's phone buzzed with a text from Jack: Don't wait up. Team party at Murphy's.

She read between the lines. Don't show up. Don't embarrass me. Again.

""Right. Of course."" Emma forced a smile. ""I'll take that car now.""

Three hours and two unanswered calls later, Emma sat cross-legged on their king-sized bed, laptop open to a spreadsheet that tracked the household budget. Jack made millions, but old habits die hard. Her grandfather had taught her to watch every penny, even when you had billions of them.

The front door slammed downstairs. Emma closed her laptop and took a deep breath.

""Em? You still up?"" Jack's voice echoed through their too-big house, slightly slurred.

""In the bedroom,"" she called back, slipping on her glasses like armor.

Jack appeared in the doorway, still in his game-day suit, tie hanging loose around his neck. At thirty-two, he was in his hockey prime—six-foot-two, shoulders like a coat hanger, jawline that could cut glass. He'd been gorgeous when they met in college. Now he was sculpted.

""Helluva game, huh?"" He grinned, running a hand through his dark hair. ""Did you see that last goal?""

""It was amazing."" Emma smiled genuinely. ""That spin move was insane.""

""Coach said it's going on the season highlight reel."" Jack loosened his tie further but didn't move to take it off. He just stood there, swaying slightly.

Emma's stomach knotted. Something was wrong.

""You okay?"" she asked.

""Yeah. No. I mean—"" Jack reached into his inside jacket pocket and pulled out an envelope. ""I need to talk to you about something.""

""What's that?"" Emma nodded toward the envelope, though she already knew. The same dread she'd been feeling for months crystallized into something solid and cold.

Jack tossed the envelope onto the bed. It slid across the comforter and bumped against her knee.

""Divorce papers,"" he said, his voice oddly flat. ""My lawyer drew them up last week.""

Emma stared at the envelope. Her name was typed on the front in cold, official letters. She should cry, she thought distantly. She should be shocked. Instead, she felt like she'd been watching this train approach for miles.

""Were you going to discuss this with me first, or just throw legal documents at my face?"" The words came out calmer than she felt.

Jack had the decency to look uncomfortable for about half a second.

""Look, we both know this isn't working."" He gestured between them. ""You're... you, and I'm...""

""You're what, Jack?""

""I'm Jack Reynolds now."" He squared his shoulders. ""I've got endorsement deals. Magazine covers. I need someone who understands this lifestyle.""

Emma laughed, she couldn't help it. ""This lifestyle? You mean the one where I've supported you through three team changes and two injuries? Where I've moved cities four times in six years? That lifestyle?""

""See, this is what I mean."" Jack pointed at her accusingly. ""You're always keeping score.""

""I'm a numbers person. Sue me."" Emma picked up the envelope but didn't open it.

""The thing is,"" Jack continued, pacing now, ""I've met someone who gets it. She understands the demands, the spotlight.""

Emma's laugh turned hollow. ""Wow. So there's already a replacement. Who is she? Let me guess—one of those influencers models who's been commenting on your photos?""

Jack's silence was answer enough.

""How long?"" Emma asked.

""Does it matter?""

""It matters to me.""

Jack sighed dramatically. ""A few months. It just happened.""

Emma stood, suddenly unable to have this conversation in the bed they'd shared for eight years. ""Things don't 'just happen,' Jack. You make choices.""

""Fine. I chose someone who makes more sense for me now."" He threw his hands up. ""I'm not the same guy who married you in college. I need...""

""More?"" Emma supplied.

""Different."" Jack softened his tone, as if that made it better. ""You're smart, Em. Too smart for this world, honestly. But you don't fit anymore. You hide at games. You wear Target when everyone else wears Prada.""

""I like Target,"" Emma said, knowing how ridiculous this argument was becoming.

""The settlement's fair,"" Jack continued, nodding at the envelope. ""The house, a million cash, alimony for two years while you 'find yourself' or whatever.""

Emma clutched the envelope tighter, crumpling it slightly. She thought about all the things Jack didn't know—about her family, her grandfather, the trust fund she'd never touched, the shares she owned in companies whose names would make his head spin.

Her phone rang, cutting through the tense silence. Her grandfather's photo lit up the screen.

Jack rolled his eyes.

Emma snatched the phone. ""I should take this.""

""Of course you should."" Jack grabbed a duffel bag from the closet—already packed, she noticed. ""I'll be at the Ritz until I find a place. My lawyer's number is in there. Don't make this messy, Em.""

As Jack headed for the door, Emma called after him: ""Jack?""

He turned, hand on the doorframe.

""Your career high record is twenty-eight goals in a season. My grandfather made twenty-eight million dollars last week."" She smiled sweetly. ""Just keeping score.""

Jack's face contorted in confusion as she answered the phone.

""Hi, Grandpa,"" Emma said, watching her soon-to-be-ex-husband walk out. ""Yes, I saw the game. Listen, I think I'm ready to take you up on that job offer after all.""

The job Jack thought was just some entry-level position at Mitchell Industries—owned by her grandfather, Franklin Mitchell, billionaire and majority owner of the Boston Blades hockey franchise.

As the front door slammed shut, Emma finally opened the envelope. Beneath the legal jargon was one simple truth: Jack Reynolds had just made the biggest mistake of his career.

Emma stepped out of the taxi in front of Mitchell Tower, a gleaming seventy-story monument to her grandfather's business success. Sunglasses firmly in place, she'd swapped yesterday's jeans for a simple navy dress. Her divorce-papers-to-the-face makeover.

The security guard nodded as she entered. ""Morning, Ms. Carter.""

She smiled at the use of her mother's maiden name—the one she'd been using professionally for the past year. As far as anyone knew, Emma Carter was just another employee at Mitchell Industries, not Emma Mitchell Reynolds, granddaughter of Franklin Mitchell and soon-to-be-ex-wife of hockey star Jack Reynolds.

The executive elevator whisked her to the top floor. No scan, no keycard needed—it recognized her face. Money couldn't buy happiness, but it could buy really cool tech.

Franklin Mitchell's assistant—a perpetually frazzled man named Walter who'd been with him for thirty years—jumped up when she arrived.

""He's waiting for you, Ms. Carter. Can I get you coffee?""

""I'm fine, Walter. Thanks.""

Emma paused outside her grandfather's office, collecting herself. Don't cry. Don't break. Taking a deep breath, she pushed open the heavy oak door.

Franklin Mitchell sat behind a desk the size of a small boat. At seventy-eight, he still came to the office daily, even though doctors had been telling him to slow down for a decade. His white hair was immaculately combed, his bow tie perfectly centered. The only concession to age was the oxygen cannula in his nose, connected to a discreet tank beside his chair.

""There's my girl."" He beamed, pushing himself up with surprising strength.

Emma crossed the room and hugged him, careful not to squeeze too hard. He smelled like peppermint and old books.

""Sit, sit."" He gestured to the chair opposite his desk. ""You look like a mess, Emmy.""

Emma laughed despite herself. ""Good morning to you too, Grandpa.""

""I'm old. I get to skip pleasantries."" He studied her over his glasses. ""So he finally did it?""

""Last night."" Emma sank into the chair. ""How did you know?""

""Because I know everything."" Franklin tapped his temple. ""And because his agent called our PR department asking how to handle press for a friendly divorce.""

Emma's eyebrows shot up. ""Already? The papers aren't even signed.""

""Jack moves fast. On and off the ice."" Franklin's face darkened. ""Ungrateful little pissant.""

""Grandpa!""

""What? I'm not wrong."" He shuffled papers on his desk. ""I've never liked him.""

""You came to our wedding.""

1kh052z,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1kh052z/for_prospective_students_please_read_the_people/,"For Prospective Students: Please Read, The People At This School Are Super Shitty","Let me start off with a story. I joined the facebook class of 2018 page when I was about to join UCD. I asked a question about if UCD wasn't a first choice, and explained my situation. I've heard a bunch of dismissive responses like oh this is only for students, you are violating our page. And another guy is like ""get out, this is only for students. Go post on reddit."" I later got kicked out.  This kind of vibe had been very evident at the school. My advise is that never ignore subtle clues when it comes to getting to know a person, organization, or campus. The subtle clues paint the whole picture. Also I visited campus in 2016, and a protest group kept marching when there was a tour presentation and broke up the whole group lol. This was also the same case at scu for example. One perspective student asked whether the evening mba program was worth it, and the student ambassador just replied career coaches charge $100/hr. This was at a prospective student events. And this program turned out to be a joke, with fake and delusional people. That was an example of a subtle clue.

There was also like a shooting at picnic day. When I was there someone got roofied at wunderbar, and a police officer got shot. This area is unsafe and has a bunch of creeps.

Look at my posts, I would advise you to read it carefully.

Just look at how shitty some of the comments were when I posted about my thoughts and my opportunity to miss getting a girlfriend. Please read about the awful things that happened to me while here at UCD. The funny thing is I may have posted the most severe things, but I didn't provide the full story on them, nor did I tell everything. I may have posted about 75% to 50% of the things that happened to me there.

Look now in all fairness, people everywhere are just shitty. I went to scu and people there were also pretty shitty. Though, not at the degree of this school. Even at UCSB, some people were pretty shitty when I went there for the weekend.  Now in all fairness, SCU is a small private school with a fifth of the students at UC Davis. People are just rich and wealthy there, so it would make sense that they are less shitty. People at Foothill college were also sort of shitty as well, but not in the degree of UCD.

Look, as someone pointed out in one of the comments. It may have been me being more at the wrong place, at the wrong time type of thing. And sure, I can't judge an entire college based on my experience. This may be a good experience for some, idk. This comment is very valid and fair. 

But out of all this, the common themes are people being self serving, opportunistic, superficial, selfishness, inconsiderate, transactional, rigid/controlling, dismissive, unsupportive, and overall rude.

I will say this though. People there did not intended to hurt me. Nothing was malicious or anything. They were just super selfish and inconsiderate. Whenever someone did harm to me, it was purely out of selfishness without consideration of my feelings.

I also went to the GSB buildings last year, and they are like can you not walk around in the building. Students may be testing and stuff. But aren't there people walking there anyways, lol.

Also people no showing/ late canceling was common there. Professors are terrible at responding to emails, and everything is transactional af. Petes coffee charged me $.25C for water there. Everything is also transactional, I haven't been there in 2019. But I only actively talk to two guys back from my undergrad at this day. Professors nor faculty from the economics ever responded to my emails. Administration/ Faculty/Staff are greedy, and unethical, and they pretend to care.

Oh... People were mean to professor Ashish Shenoy.  
[https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/2285132](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/2285132)

But he wasn't bad at all, he was just hard. People were being rude,I mean they were just frustrated. The first comments on the rate my professor class was from my class. But in all fairness, the guys that were being rude were not mean to be at all. But I wasn't really like friends with any of them either lol. They were also posting stupid shit on the question forum drawing dick pics and shit lol.  The guys at scu did the same thing with the finance professor. But they didn't display any rude or mean behaviors.

Oh my experience was mostly associated with transfer students. Of course, it makes sense that they are shitty. First of all, it's easy af to get in as a transfer student, and they bullshitted and took bullshit community college courses. Some professors, and the bouncers in nightlife were also shitty af.

I just think Davises problem is that they are too strict, while the problem with SCU is the opposite. You have to maintain balance as a university.

Look this is just my two cents. Who are you going to honestly believe me, I was near stem/stem minor who got mostly A's and B's in my classes and did well. I'm almost 30, and making 6 figures. Or these redditors, who are posting about being kicked out or on academic probation.  This is something to think about, I could care less.

I talked to the SCU evening mba admissions about how my experience was awful in the program, and that motivated me to talk to the admissions director about how I was mistreated, and I started thinking about my past. And guess what, she talked briefly and intentionally hung up on me. So this is retaliation for that.",0,1746631564.0,UCDavis,1,0.07,False

I've noticed a general trend of decreasing quality and comfort that has seemed to accellerate over time.  This month my membership has expired, and I need to renew... but I am considering simply letting it end.  Not sure what I will do, and kinda want to vent and think out loud here.

I will start by saying, overall, I was very happy with the membership.  I have been 1K or GS over all this time, so I travel a lot.  The membership made my travel easier and even enjoyable, but even moreso it was a cost-savings measure.  I figured that a $500 membership was well spent as I averaged about 30-40 round trip flights per year, and most airports I frequent have a United lounge.  This meant food and drink departing and arriving, and meant a lot less expenses as, on average, every day of travel had 2 means I would otherwise pay for out of pocket. That's less than $10 per day of travel, where I otherwise would likely spend $30-40 or more on those meals.  The food was good, the coffee was a must, and the space clean and comfortable.  There were even notable improvements in many lounges, especially the updated lounges in Denver A, O'hare, and Newark.

But over time I have seen the crowding get terrible, frankly.  Often there are not even seats available in the lounges.  The food option quality has certainly gotten worse, especially lately.  There was always a monthly changing regional ""main dish"" option, plenty of sides... now it seems like many lounges are just at ""snacks"" level.  Many lounges are grossly out of date (IAD and IAH), cramped, with lines to use the bathrooms that are usualy longer than those outside the lounge, and the stalls are not much, if at all, nicer. The updated lounges, like at Denver were amazing at first... but food quality now is not much if at all better than it was before it opened.

The biggest kicker now is that the price is going up for access, from $500 for 1K members to $750...  and you also apparently can no longer bring guests.  It is clear they are pushing everyone to get the credit card for access by making a straight-up cash membership a terrible deal.

Bottom line is I am not sure how much better my travel days are now with the lounge than without it, and it isn't something I've had to think about for a long time.  If I keep access I am forced to get the card to approximate the same cost and level of access.",4,1746631448.0,unitedairlines,14,0.75,False

**Why This Pick?**

With seasoned Seattle pitching ace Bryan Woo (2.58 ERA) on the mound, I think this encounter will stay a low-scoring one, friends. And while Athletics starter Gunnar Hoglund (1.50 ERA) has only had 1 outing so far this season against the Miami Marlins, he proved to be incredibly capable in his MLB debut. I think we’ll get a bit of a pitcher’s duel out of today’s game and the Under will cash, betting fam.

1kh00wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1kh00wg/is_low_alcohol_considered_alcohol_england/,Is Low alcohol considered alcohol? England.,"Hi, so basically I work as a full carer and I was wondering why all my hours were gone so I called up my office and it turns out I’m suspended.

The office had received complaints that I was “drinking on shift while taking care of a service user” and I immediately said it was zero/low percentage alcohol. 

For context one of the people I take care off has a 5 hour visit where he likes  to get out the house and for me to drive him to a pub. There we usually drink coffee, chat, play games on our phones and watch football. During this visit I drink coffee, water and from time to time zero/ 0.5% alcohol which i thought was acceptable as I’m not drinking such that it could hamper my driving ability or any other cognitive ability. Even the 0.5% I only drink one off if I do as I like the 0% Guineas more.

They have called me in tomorrow to hear my side of the story and I was suddenly very concerned that it could be argued the 0.5% ghost ship I was having can be considered low alcohol. I don’t know the specifics of it but legally can the 0.5% be considered alcohol in a company contract that prohibits drinking at all on the job.

Starting out it seemed it would be a chat and share show, but it quickly became her preaching about how skilled she is and getting hype from her minions. She ran like 5 shared items. At one point she said about someone ""I don't know why you're not blocked yet"" and cleared the chat, and they didn't even say anything inflammatory.

Someone clear this up for me- why is this coming off so weird and icky to me? She talked about having people ""sponsor"" the show and funding a giveaway for HER (someone else's) show. I don't really understand how that works logistically, and I don't get why someone would fund a giveaway for Nicole when they could do their own? Then she very clearly stated that sponsors get priority in share shows, recognition in shows, basically becoming Nicole's little pet. Her post about it says ""bless our community"" but how does this bless anyone but Nicole?

The whole vibe was that there is a ""pay to play"" element, or rather a ""pay to be Nicole's friend"" thing. I guess the State and Sip show will be a regular morning ~~preach~~ teach and share show, but she literally said ""you will get rewarded for good behavior"" in context of getting your items to actually be shared on her show. This was after she talked for like 20 minutes about ""whales"" and buyers who buy insane amounts from her.

Also in this show, she said something along the lines of ""the Disney community didn't really exist much until I came along"" and that the brand recognized her for her... amazing ability in selling Disney stuff? Basically stating that resale of Disney items wasn't a thing until she started it. That... cannot possibly be true??? I mean please let me know if I am wrong.

## Key Features analysis

The features of a coffee cup holder can significantly impact its functionality and suitability for different situations.

**Material Durability:** the choice of material directly affects the cup holder's lifespan and its ability to withstand daily wear and tear. High-quality plastic, stainless steel, or durable silicone are common choices, each offering varying degrees of resilience to impacts, temperature fluctuations, and UV exposure. Products made from robust plastics, such as ABS or polycarbonate, are known for their impact resistance and longevity, while stainless steel variants offer superior corrosion resistance and a premium aesthetic.Silicone cup holders provide excellent versatility and grip, preventing slippage and minimizing the risk of spills.

**Adjustability and Compatibility:** A versatile coffee cup holder should accommodate a range of cup sizes and shapes.Adjustable arms, expandable bases, or flexible silicone inserts allow the holder to securely grip everything from slender travel mugs to wider disposable cups. Some models feature adjustable clamps or straps for attaching to different surfaces, such as car vents, stroller frames, or desk edges. Ensuring compatibility with your preferred beverage containers and the intended mounting location is crucial for optimal usability.

**Insulation Properties:** Certain coffee cup holders incorporate insulation features to help maintain the temperature of your drink. Insulated walls or thermal layers can slow down heat transfer, keeping hot beverages warmer for longer and preventing condensation on the exterior of the holder. These features are notably beneficial for commuters or anyone who enjoys sipping their coffee over an extended period. Materials like neoprene or vacuum-sealed stainless steel are commonly used for insulation purposes.

**Mounting Mechanism:** The method of attachment is a critical factor in determining the stability and security of the coffee cup holder. car cup holders might utilize expanding bases that fit snugly into existing console slots, while stroller cup holders often employ clamps or straps for attaching to the frame. Desk cup holders may feature suction cups, adhesive pads, or clamp-on designs. The chosen mounting mechanism should provide a secure and stable hold, even on bumpy roads or during vigorous activity.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Spills are inevitable, so a coffee cup holder should be easy to clean and maintain. Models with removable parts or smooth, non-porous surfaces are easier to wipe down and prevent the buildup of stains or odors. Dishwasher-safe materials are a convenient option for effortless cleaning. Avoiding cup holders with intricate designs or hard-to-reach crevices will simplify the cleaning process and ensure hygiene.**Design and Aesthetics:** While functionality is paramount, the design and aesthetics of a coffee cup holder can also be significant, especially for users who value style and visual appeal. Cup holders are available in a wide range of colors,finishes,and styles,allowing you to choose one that complements your car interior,stroller design,or desk décor. Some models feature sleek, minimalist designs, while others offer more elaborate or eye-catching aesthetics.

Ive been on 100mg sertraline for a good 6 yrs now and luckily never really had any noticeable side effects, since my libido suddendly died off a few weeks ago.
Its important to note that i also had bad liver values which might be the due to me taking pantoprazole because i had a gastritis for like 2 weeks 6 weeks ago.

Im in a point in my life where Id like to explore my sexuality though and for a long time now ive been thinking about lowering my meds in general.
(Read about effects on bone density)
which is why i decided to slowly taper off my dosis:

For 3 weeks i took 75 mg and this week i started with 50 mg.
Last week i felt a heavy fatigue kicking in. This week is better though but i still feel very tired even after waking up.


All in all i still feel mentally well though i had a few moments where i felt anxiety heightening, OCD thoughts piercing deeper than they did back then, but this could also be related to me starting to drink coffee regurlary because i heard it helps to rise potence.

I still havent talked with my doctor about this. This year i was about to switch my psychiartist but given my chaotic nature i had to rearrange that appointment to september. My goal is to stay on 50mg till and observe further developments.

Anyone got helpful advice from their own experience?
Or is able to make a prognosis on further side effects?

I’m childless by choice, they have two (10f) and a 19 yo (assigned male at birth) who has gone through multiple stages of gender identity but now identifies as female. For simplicity’s sake I’m going to use “they/them” pronouns. The 19 has struggled with mental health and substance use for some time, was expelled from their high school (long story but they did complete their diploma in an alternate school), and has been unable to keep a job for longer than six months at any point. Last month they had a giant fight with their mother (custody has always been 50/50), and said they wanted to live with us full time. I was against this because I don’t think it’s ultimately good for them. They have less supervision and more space at our house, plus quite frankly, this is not what I signed up for. I’ve been the kids biggest ally, always planning their birthdays and holidays. I took them to the clinic for an STI panel and a checkup for goodness ale. I Always making sure the kids are priority one and am actively being present, but this situation, in my opinion is unfair. 

They don’t pay rent, they don’t contribute to the house, they say they have goals like going to school and show no effort. Their father has a bit of Disney Dad guilt about the divorce and lets them both get away with murder imo, but I don’t overstep and try to keep things positive in the house for everyone. Let me note right now, I support people of all walks of life, including the queer community. I in fact am one myself. This is not the issue. 

Last night it came out they’re bringing club drugs into our home. To his credit their father wigged and gave a stern “no way” speech. But how he’ll back it up, I seriously doubt. I’m super uncomfortable with this. Weed was one thing but club drugs?! We have a 10yo. Then this morning as I’m leaving for work, I realize the 19 is still awake from the night before and drank all of my coffee while I was getting ready. I’m just at my wits end with this. How their father is allowing this behavior is beyond my understanding. I had a meltdown this week and gave him an ultimatum that if he doesn’t get this behavior under control I have to leave. Problem with that is, if I move out, it would have to be a breakup because the only reason I’m even in this state is our relationship. I feel so torn but, I just don’t understand how he can sit by and watch this train wreck for his eldest while also ruining a good relationship and putting his daughter in what I consider danger.

1kgzqyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kgzqyn/can_the_dwts_danweitesi_cold_brew_coffee_maker/,Can the DWTS DANWEITESI Cold Brew Coffee Maker Elevate Your Morning Coffee Routine Review?,"The DWTS DANWEITESI GLH-01 Cold Brew Coffee Maker combines quality craftsmanship with thoughtful features designed to make cold brewing simple and enjoyable. I’ve been testing it for a few weeks, brewing my coffee almost daily, and it’s clear why this product is popular among cold brew lovers. From its durable design to its functionality, it ticks a lot of boxes, but there are some areas where it could do better.

**Build and Design Quality**  
Durability and elegance shine through with the coffee maker’s sleek glass design. The food-grade soda-lime glass not only looks sophisticated but also feels sturdy in the hand. The wide mouth of the jar contributes to its practicality—it’s easy to pour my cold brew concentrate without spills. There’s also a handy measurement scale etched onto the glass, making it a breeze to get the correct coffee-to-water ratio. However, I did notice that it’s best to avoid sudden temperature changes—pouring boiling water directly into the jar is a no-go if you want to keep it lasting long. Trust me, I almost made that mistake during one rushed experiment!

**Cold Brew Filter Performance**  
The stainless steel filter is genuinely one of the best features of this cold brew coffee maker. Its conical design increases the contact between coffee grounds and water, creating a rich and consistent flavor. Each batch of coffee I made was smooth with no sediment thanks to the tightly woven mesh. My cousin, a cold brew enthusiast, complimented the lack of bitterness in the coffee I served, and that’s high praise coming from her! However, cleaning the filter—though not overly complicated—requires thorough rinsing to ensure no coffee grounds get left behind.

**Good Aspects**  
- The wide-mouth jar simplifies pouring and cleaning.  
- The conical filter delivers sediment-free coffee.  
- Measurements etched on the glass ensure precise brewing ratios.  
- Silicone-sealed lid keeps coffee fresh in the fridge.  

[Check DWTS DANWEITESI GLH-01 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0ckn6mcld/)

**Ease of Use**  
This coffee maker is straightforward even for those new to the cold brew process. The spout has a safety snap and silicone seal, which ensures no mess even when you store the jar tilted in the fridge. Plus, the thickened handle adds extra comfort when pouring. What I particularly enjoy is the reversible lid; it’s intuitive and makes switching between pouring and sealing a seamless experience. The included filter works well beyond coffee—you can use it for iced tea or infused water, which I did one hot afternoon, experimenting with lemon and mint-infused water. It worked phenomenally!

**Critiques**  
- The jar doesn’t do well with sudden temperature changes.  
- A smaller handle would benefit those with limited grip strength.  

**Multipurpose Features for Coffee Lovers**  
One thing that makes this cold brew maker stand out is its versatility. Aside from brewing coffee, it works as a tea pitcher, infused water jug, or even a storage jar for dry goods like coffee beans. Over the weekend, I repurposed it to store leftover iced tea, and the airtight seal preserved its freshness perfectly. Thinking about gift ideas for friends? It’s a thoughtful option for coffee lovers or anyone building out their home cafe aesthetic.

**Competing Options**  
Comparing this to well-known cold brew makers like the Toddy or Hario Mizudashi, the DWTS DANWEITESI model shines in affordability and its multipurpose capabilities. The conical filter design certainly gives it an edge over the Hario, where the straight filter limits ground-water interaction. On the flip side, I found the Toddy system slightly larger in capacity, which might appeal to those brewing for families or workspaces. The DWTS DANWEITESI, however, packs aesthetic charm and takes up less space in the fridge.

**Money's Worth**  
Considering everything this cold brew coffee maker offers—from its reliable filter performance to its well-thought-out design—it provides excellent value for its price. It manages to build into your coffee routine with little fuss and adds versatility to your kitchen gear collection. Whether you’re a coffee aficionado or just starting your cold brew journey, it presents a smart spending choice.

I've always suffered from severe ADHD since I was a child. Unfortunately, in my early 30s, ADHD is still very prevalent, enough so that I've recently had to get Adult ADHD Coaching in order to combat the symptoms. I brought this topic up to my coach, and she absolutely understood/loved the idea.

As an (aspiring) writer, I love to sit down and dive head first into my novel, but so often I can just never get my focus there, even when motivated. And then the idea of using Phas as a morning tool came to me.

I consider myself somewhat of a Phas expert. 300 hours in (which I know is baby numbers compared to much of the Phas community, but to my 'haven't finished a game in years a\*\*', it's a ton. I'm now at the point where the game isn't too challenging, I'm able to run Insanity fairly consistently. Now, I'm not mentioning this to brag or anything (although I am proud of myself, and can't help but feel like Chuck Norris the moment I walk through the door) but I mention it more so for you to understand that at this point, I can play without it being too mentally draining for a morning exercise.

So, to the point, Phas *has* become part of my morning exercise. After my morning workout, and with a cup of coffee, I start my day with 1-2 (sometimes 3) games of Phas.

Why? It locks in my ADHD brain! Playing Insanity specifically **requires** you to focus, to use many of your senses at once. You have to focus in your listening, your sight, etc., in order to figure out the ghost. Having a game I enjoy **force** me to focus my attention ends up stopping my mind from wandering. It gets me locked in. And then, after those 1-2 games, my mind suddenly switches to the book I'm currently writing, and I've found I've been able to transfer that intense focus to that instead.

I always felt guilty waking up in the morning on a work day and playing a game, even though I knew it was benefitting me. But after talking this through with my new ADHD coach, she was thrilled, and was even taking notes for other clients. 

In a way, Phas is my morning crossword.

I am super thankful for it, for it has become a very beneficial tool for me in my adult life. Felt like sharing this with you all.

**Recovered from Azoospermia**

In 2023, I was diagnosed with azoospermia—a devastating discovery at the time.

tree years ago, I underwent unsuccessfull three cycles of IUI while having low semen numbers. Although my hormone panel and DNA fragmentation results were good, I had no frozen sperm. Unfortunately, despite undergoing multiple cycles, not a single doctor advised me to freeze my sperm. We remained hopeful that my semen analysis numbers would improve, and we will succeed with IUI.  but instead, we were blindsided by devastating news as a couple with news of aoozaspermia. 

**My first and most important recommendation: Please freeze your sperm!**

My doctor prescribed Clomid for three months, but it had no effect. Ultrasonic, tests, blood work. After consulting two doctors, both discontinued my treatment, their common response being, *“At this point, I have no answers for you.”*

*And the fertility clinic suggested to do M-tese surgery or donor sperm method which I did not, consider both of them as option.*

As devasted couple we put our efforts and beliefs from the scratch. 

# During these 2 years Steps I Took

1. **Intense Gym Routine** – I incorporated regular cardio sessions using a step-climbing machine, which had me drenched in sweat within 15 minutes. Additionally, I focused on strengthening my upper leg muscles and thighs. During this process, I lost fat, gained muscle, and improved my cardiovascular health. [Source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10307666/)
2. **Clean Diet** – I completely eliminated fried foods, sodas, and pizza, focusing solely on protein and salads. My body fat percentage decreased significantly.
   * My daily breakfast consisted of one boiled organic pasteurized egg and coffee—nothing else.
   * I ate one avocado almost every day.
   * I also consumed one tablespoon of tomato paste daily!!!, which contains lycopene. [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28049263/)

5. **Reducing Exposure to 5G Wi-Fi** – I relocated my office’s 5G Wi-Fi modem and the router at home, extending the cables to place them at least 30 feet away. I also began using my phone in airplane mode with Wi-Fi calling and SMS enabled, keeping mobile data off. **Avoid sleeping with your phone next to you unless it's in airplane mode.** [Source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8497974/)

I want someone that I can really get to know, and hopefully someone who would be as willing to stick with me as id be to stick with them.

**A Bit Of Info About Me.**  
**I'm from the US**  
**hobbies:**  
**Vidya game:** I have many, a lot are kinda niche, ask me for my list! I mostly play on PC.  
**Anime:** Action, Slice Of Life: Psychological Horror. (Many more) I know too much about Dragon Ball  
**Music:** Tokyo Machine (Electronic), Emo Rap, Hyperpop, Digital Hardcore. My Depresso Espresso playlist  
**Long Calls & Talks:** My social battery is massive (cuz autism adhd go crazy) if I like you, and if I like you enough I could literally spend all day with you most days, I know that doesnt fit a lot of people though.

Im the kind of person that really enjoys late night gaming sessions, cozy anime marathons, and cups of coffee under a rain‑spattered window, listening to moody music. My pronouns are She/Her

**What Im Looking For.**  
**Preferably around my age 18-24**

Someone who wants to make a gentle and caring connection.  
**Values consistency**: you’ll check in when you say you will, and you don’t mind a little daily check‑in on my end.  
**Loves small moments**: texting about a new song you found, sharing screenshots of our latest in‑game adventures, or sending a “thinking of you” GIF at random, its cute and I do it a lot.  
**Understands anxiety & social fatigue**: I have autism and a lot of trauma‑based habits, so sometimes I freeze up or need extra reassurance. I’m working on it, but patience is huge.

If any of this resonates, I’d love to hear from you! Tell me your favorite comfort game, or your top rainy‑day song, let’s start small and see where it goes.

1kgzhss,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1kgzhss/does_invigorated_water_ph_recharge_3f_filter/,Does Invigorated Water pH Recharge 3F Filter Dispenser Truly Deliver? A Comprehensive Review,"The Invigorated Water RECHARGE Parent Alkaline Water Filter has been a fascinating addition to my kitchen setup. I am an avid water drinker, and the idea of elevating plain tap water into mineral-rich, alkaline goodness resonated with me instantly. Equipped with three robust pH001 filters and boasting a 52-cup capacity, this countertop dispenser has shown that drinking water can indeed be more than just a mundane chore.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This countertop dispenser impressed me from the first glance with its sleek, modern look. Designed to be compact yet functional, it fits perfectly in both my refrigerator and on the counter. The anti-slip base ensures it doesn’t slide around, which is quite useful on my sometimes-cluttered kitchen surface. The BPA-free material adds peace of mind, knowing no harmful chemicals are leaching into my water. At only 3.4 pounds, it’s remarkably easy to move when switching its location.

**Pros**  
- Convenient design fits on countertops and refrigerator shelves.  
- Non-slip base prevents accidental movement.  
- BPA-free materials promote a sustainable, toxin-free solution.  

[Check Invigorated Water RECHARGE Parent price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b07q29s2nh/)  

**Performance Matters**  
Every sip feels noticeably revamped. With its triple-filtration system, this device boosts the pH of water, achieving alkaline levels of up to pH9. Before filtering, my tap water had a dull, metallic taste. Now, it’s refreshingly clean and mineralized. The difference is noticeable; it makes tea and coffee taste better too, with no lingering chlorine or harsh aftertaste to mute the flavors. The 0.15 gallons-per-minute filtration rate works well for my needs, although it may not be ideal for someone requiring rapid refills.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Effectively removes unwanted particles, heavy metals, and chlorine taste.  
- It enhances water quality with minerals like calcium and magnesium.  

**The Drawbacks**  
While the overall experience has been pretty satisfying, there are a few areas worth mentioning. The water only filters when put in the upper chamber, and it can't process water at temperatures above 3°F. That’s not a dealbreaker for me but might be limiting for someone who occasionally needs filtered hot water. Cleaning doesn’t come naturally either — the intricate design required me to read the instructions twice to disassemble it.

**Critiques**  
- Lower temperature handling of up to 3°F might disappoint some users.  
- Intricate parts make cleaning a bit time-consuming.  

**Competing Brands**  
In comparison to something like the Brita Ultramax water dispenser, this product stands out because of its mineralizing properties. Brita focuses solely on filtering but lacks the capability to enhance water with minerals. Yet, Brita offers a more straightforward cleaning process and slightly faster filtration speeds. While ZeroWater competes with its comprehensive five-stage filtration, its filters can be pricey to replace. The Invigorated Water dispenser sits beautifully between the two, offering multi-stage filtration with sustainability at an affordable rate.

**Smart Spending**  
This product brings fantastic value to those who want clean, mineralized alkaline water at home. Its 96-gallon per filter capacity saves frequent replacements, unlike competitors that burn through filters faster and cost more long-term. It’s clear that the one-time setup investment is well-justified for all the benefits it brings.

For the most part the relationship was my emotional rock and she made me very happy, but sometimes I wonder If the way she handles our relationship is normal. For example usually we both wake up at the same time and since we’re working from home we both have plenty of time to cook a good home made meal. 

We’d wake up together and ask each other what we wanted and agree on a menu for the day, and we’d head together to the kitchen and one of us would cook while the other cleaned. Usually breakfast falls on me and I don’t mind I it and sometimes she’d tell me she don’t feel like doing anything that morning and I’d take care of everything. 
This morning we woke up and after her alarm went off I asked her what should we make for breakfast. She got groggy with me and told me she wasn’t in the mood for breakfast and then told me to let her sleep. 

I was annoyed by her lack of engagement and her tone but I ignored it and got up and made myself a cup of coffee and went to work on something I had a close deadline for as I’m trying to start my own business. She woke up and asked what I’ve been doing I told her I made coffee and I was working on my project. 

Now I don’t expect a pat on the back for doing something that would benefit me in the long term specially that she knows how hard I’ve struggled with imposter syndrome. But what I didn’t expect is her going off on me saying I didn’t do the dishes because I wanted her to do them and that I was selfish and making a cup of coffee made more dishes for her to do.

 I don’t know why she would say something like that. I haven’t even thought of her doing those dishes, I think if they bothered her so much she could’ve easily told me to take care I’d them and I would’ve done it happily. I don’t see why she would say something like that when all I did was make the choice to finish my work while she slept. I could’ve chosen to do Pilates instead of washing those dishes or just meditated and I still don’t think she should say something so cruel. 

What bothered me more is that she got up to do them aggressively, and while I was making tea and cleaning the living room waiting for her to finish so I can make breakfast in peace I came and found her making it herself. I asked her what is she doing and she just stonewalled me. 

It felt like I’m being punished for idk what!! If the dishes bothered her that much why couldn’t she have communicated that nicely? 
Also it’s the fact after that she finished cooking all by herself and didn’t even bother inviting me to eat knowing damn well we didn’t have grocery for me to make anything for myself and that all there is a bar of granula that I ate. 

I don’t want to break up with her as I love her so much but things like this make me question If she looks down on me or doesn’t value me because I would think a thousand time before making her life difficult because of something she probably didn’t even mean.",1,1746629986.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

Let me explain. I have lost 53 lbs since Oct 2. The last four months have been a yoyo. I increased to 7.5 two months ago. Today was shot day and I gained two pounds. 😓  In 4 months, I have lost only 14lbs, even through the increased dosage. 

I had been able to decrease my Losartan, BP med, to a half dose up until this past week, when I had to go back to a full dose. 

And about two months ago, when I increased to 7.5, my pleasure in working out, suddenly and drastically disappeared. Very weird. I make myself go now.

Hair loss and brittle nails have increased so I'm a little concerned about increasing my dose to 10. I started putting collagen peptides in my coffee and added Biotin daily. Maybe it has slowed down but I'm still losing hair and nails chipping. I NEVER had any issues before and have always had super thick hair and strong nails. Losing hair and nails but not weight.

I know Eliquis can potentially affect the potency of other meds. Is it possible that it is doing just that with Zepbound? I take my shots in the morning. Eliquis is 2x daily. I'm waiting 2 hours to give Zepbound time.

Or, the other thing I have wondered, is it possible to have a ""bad batch"" of Zepbound? A batch that is less effective? I pay out of pocket for vials through Lily Direct.

I would love to hear prescriber and pharmaceutical perspectives. I've done ""research"" but cannot find anything that is specific to Zepbound and Eliquis. ",1,1746629827.0,Zepbound,2,1.0,False

Aum-La leaned back in her chair, enjoying the crackle of her spine as she closed her eyes with a sigh.

She had been on this ramshackle station for nearly a year at this point, and it was just now *starting* to be improved. The air quality was better nowadays, and the station had both Drafritti and Kojynn crawling all over it like lice on a Kafya.

Aum-La had been hoping to go back down to Earth in order to teach again, but it appeared it was not to be; The Kafya and other races that would be arriving were not “allowed” to go down to Earth proper, as their racial leaders feared that the students “wouldn’t come back” if they spent too much time planetside.

The Skalathir woman hummed out a laugh through her draconic nostrils, trailing a clawed finger down the blue scales of her cheek. 

That was, after all, the *plan*.

The Kafya were easy, but she had to leave the Pwah to Mr. Radishow; There was just too much royal politicking to deal with, and she had her hands full with everything else.

Like *lesson plans*.

“All I have to do is lay down the groundwork for their curiosity.” Aum-La said to herself as she leaned back forward, fluffing out her thick sweater as she resettled herself in her large chair. “And the rest takes care of itself.”

A small knock at her open door caught her attention, and Aum-La closed several files on her data-slate before speaking up. “Come in!”

“Miss La.” A Kojynn male intoned as he ducked his carved mask of a head, all four of his arms behind his back respectively. “I have news of your new classroom.”

“Oh?” Aum-La asked brightly, standing up from her desk and sliding her data-slate into her belt keeper.

The Kojynn smiled, carrying it into his eyes for easier viewing along with a small sprawl of digital lines along the bottom of the mask. “It is ready, and fully renovated.”

“Wonderful!” Aum-La said happily, clapping her hands together a few times with a jangle of her wealth rings. Skalathir wore their wealth openly, forming it into segmented rings of gold and platinum worn around the wrists, forearms, and shoulders.

Aum-La quite liked the Kojynn; They were a smart, subtle race that desired privacy above anything else. Their attachment to Humanity came from their timely arrival and successful defense of two Kojynn home worlds, having lost *three* other planets while simply outfitting Humanity for war.

Kojynni, as they were sometimes called, had skin the color of powders, ranging from light blue all the way to a seaside gray. Their eyes were bright and vibrant, nearly shining out of their carved masks and holding much of their emotion. Due to their culture of keeping their face covered, their masks held small lines of flashing lights, helping those around them understand if they were smiling or frowning, though a mask turned *off* usually meant the Kojynn did not want to be spoken to at all.

Their masks were used to display a Kojynn’s personality, carved, fabricated, and etched to show the spirit of whom hid underneath it. Some Kojynn decorated their masks with symbols of their profession, such as etchings of blazing starship engines, or weaving stalks of grains. Other Kojynn preferred simpler things, such as carvings of their favorite animals or casts of their preferred heraldry. 

One of the mechanics on the station was well known for having food items on his mask, as the man was a big eater and had an entire new mask made to show his love of *noodles*. In terms of biology, their privacy went deeper, as not even medical textbooks showed the face of a Kojynn, and only Humans or their A.I. were allowed to perform medicine on their race.

This was due to the Kojynn *only* trusting Humans with their secrets, something that chafed the IDC horribly. This included wounded Kojynn going light years out of their way to see a Human doctor, and a slew of Human medical professionals starting out their careers in Kojynn space.

They were a muscular, robust, handsome peoples much like the Skalathir, though they still held an elegance and grace that the draconic peoples could not, despite their extra set of arms. The only real part of the face that everyone got to see were their ears; Low hanging, long, and round tipped, their heavily grooved ears moved with an uncanny amount of mobility, assisting the hidden face with communicating to those around them.

It was how she knew the Kojynn male at her door was pleased with himself, his ears laying relaxed and curved towards his shoulders.

“Would you like us to assist you in moving your things?” He asked, gesturing with a pair of hands to her little teaching area.

Aum-La nodded, smiling brightly as she gathered her desk things. “Of course! I have to give you guys some things to do after all.”

“We are still surprised you were able to lift that desk by yourself.” He replied, chuckling inside his mask as he snapped two pairs of fingers at the workers down the hall. “*Sha shimby!*”

Aum-La rolled her eyes inwardly; Everyone here treated her like she was some dainty wall flower, as if ignoring that her old duty was to forge *war armor*. It was bad enough the male Humans on the station always tried to spot her in the gym, and it was a rarity that she or the other Skalathir on board ever had to fill their own water bottles.

“Silly Humans…” Aum-La whispered to herself, sliding past the Kojynn filing into the room and heading down the hallway to her new classroom.

Humans, for whatever reason, could not get *enough* of the Skalathir. Whereas a particularly homely Skalathir would have trouble finding a mate, they would be all the churr on Earth, having to beat off Humans with a stick for just a moment’s peace. Previously, before her teaching went full time, Aum-La had been researching the possible reasons behind this fascination.

So far she had only gone as deep as she had time to, unraveling a web of truth and fiction revolving around Humans and a perhaps ancient war against massive scaled beasts. Around the 21st century the apparent rage turned into… *lust*, judging by ancient “interweb” archives.

They were eyebrow raising, and gave a lot of ugly Skalathir back home the kind of hope only Humans could.

That was no longer her goal though, as a few meetings with the like minded Mr. Radishow had put her on a new course of action, one that she believed in as fully as many others who sought a… *new* horizon.

Setting sail for that horizon started with the young, and no one could open eyes like a teacher.   

Aum-La arrived in her new classroom with a bright smile, looking around at the two hundred, leveled seats that all focused down to a central point; Her desk was large and reinforced, which was good since she had broken three of the damned things since she arrived, with the entire back wall being taken up by a large qua-quid display.

Qua-quid screens were all the rage with Humans since they were flexible and provided lossless color, while also being able to display a three dimensional projection if being used for wargames or tactical overlays on command ships.

Aum-La just needed them to show pictures and videos, and stepped down the shallow steps towards her desk.

She was halfway through arranging her new desk when a knock sounded at her new door, in which she pushed a button that sat near a drawer. The door slid open, revealing Mrs. Seeder.

“Ah, Mrs. Seeder!” Aum-La called out, standing out of respect and closing her four eyes as she bowed her head.

Mrs. Seeder blew a raspberry, flicking her right hand at the wrist as she stepped down towards Aum-La. “Oh come now, enough of the *missis* business, we’re at the same stage of our lives!”

“Ah, yes.” Aum-La murmured, running a hand down her horn in an apologetic gesture. “I always see the gray hair and get confused…”

Mrs. Seeder was a stung Human, but instead of vibrant colors like most stung Humans, she was instead *bereft* of any and all color. She had the tan skin of the middle continents of course, but her eyes and hair were pale gray, like that of a dreary, rainy day.

“I have your students, and I am quite happy you chose to do one large class.” Mrs. Seeder called out, wiggling a data-slate in her hand as she gamely trotted down the steps. “I hope you are ready for tomorrow.”

Aum-La shrugged. “Another day in class is just another day, and these students all being new allows me to reuse lesson plans.”

“Well Ms. La, you will have quite a spread of new students.” Mrs. Seeder said, tapping along her data-slate. “Twenty seven Skalathir, twenty three Kojynn, fifty two Lilgara, twenty eight Drafritti, thirty five Pwah, and thirty five Kafya.”

Aum-La raised her head, having stopped mid pull of a drawer. “Thirty five Kafya?”

“Yes, I know you were expecting less, but there have been… shall we say, citizens making a ‘run for it’ with smugglers.” Mrs. Seeder said with a grin. “It appears that the Elder Councils of the Kafya are being troubled by Human and Kojynn smugglers that always seem to be able to find renegades quite easily…”

Aum-La rolled her four eyes playfully. “How *awful*, however will they manage…”

The two shared a brief moment of laughter, but Aum-La tapped her data-slate to Mrs. Seeder’s and pulled the list. She scrolled down towards the Kafya, and one name in particular caught her interest.

“Tyllia Rhidi…” Aum-La whispered, tapping her nail on the name so the student profile pulled up.

“Ah yes, one of the few *actual* visa students you have.” Mrs. Seeder replied, clipping her data-slate back on her belt. “Her mother and father are quite connected, secured her a student visa to study Human ‘fashion’ after her tenure on the reception station.”

Aum-La listened with squinted eyes as she double tapped the profile, and the picture of a bright limoncello furred Kafya came onto the screen, her lilac eyes shining with eagerness. “Studying fashion, you say?”

“According to the visa.” Mrs. Seeder replied. “There are also a few minor royals in the Pwah group, but I don't see them being much trouble.”

“I see…” Aum-La murmured, pondering to herself if she had been given a boon, or a live hand grenade when it came to Tyllia. “Well, I’m sure it will be fine. Is the IDC council still badgering the Human delegation?”

Mrs. Seeder snorted in reply, tapping at her data-slate.

“That bad?” Aum-La asked.

“It’s like they are mad they are no longer winning the popularity contest.” Mrs. Seeder said darkly, putting her hands on her hips with a huff. “Honestly, they can’t be angry that our way of life is *popular* amongst some of their race. The Lilgara and Kojynni don’t even care, but *one* royal goes rogue and joins our military…”

Aum-La let out a trilling laugh. “Ah yes, the rogue prince really did kick a hornet’s nest when he did that. He had surgeons change his face and everything.”

“He caused even more of a stir when he entered into Human service.” Mrs. Seeder replied. “It was viewed as turning his back on the Pwah royals. They’ve asked *nine* times for the prince to be returned, or for Humans to allow the Pwah to ‘retrieve’ their rogue royal, but are always told no.”

Aum-La shrugged her shoulders as she sat back in her strong seat. “I’m honestly not sure why they are surprised, they should have known what was going to happen after the Skalathir Planetary Councils panicked from the sudden dip in loyalty among their scholars and workers.”

The conversation continued on for a little while more, but Aum-La was given a respite; She had her brand new class tomorrow, and she needed to figure out what plan she wanted to start with.

After bidding Mrs. Sneeder goodbye and choosing the plan that would best fit a bunch of new arrivals, she buttoned up her desk, double checked her files on the Qua-quid screen, then set off down the hallway towards her living quarters. These too were under the docket for refurbishment, but she didn’t mind the rather *spartan* layout.

She had less on the long travel to Earth, and didn’t really need much anyway. She didn’t have a mate or lover, which left the large bed more than enough to sleep in. She ate at the food ring within the station, did her laundry at the washery, and really only needed the room to sleep.

Aum-La showered, slathered on her moisturizers, then pulled on a baggy pair of sweatpants and looped the saddle-strap of the waistband over her thick, draconic tail. She pulled on a tank top, slipped on her station slippers, then reclined in bed with a cup of tea.

With nothing else to really do, she picked up her data-slate, holding it in one hand while sipping on her tea; Caravan tea was her current favorite, as it reminded her of the forge, of heat, and burning metal.

Since her hands were large, she could operate the data-slate with one hand, scrolling down until she found the flaming icon of the application she was after: Fire Light.

Fire Light was a dating app of sorts that catered to all beings, though it was over eighty percent Human.

Aum-La took a sip of her tea, and started scrolling through the long list of Human men that had found her profile that day.

Her little profile picture was one of her at her old forge in her smithing apron, muscles rippling as she wielded a gravity hammer in order to pound scale-steel flat and thin. To her lack of surprise, she had the usual greetings: “What’s up dragon-mommy?”, “You’re tipping my scales!”, “Are you seeking a knight to vanquish you?”, and so on.

The more she read, the less she wanted to *keep* doing it. She was not exactly *fine* with being lonely, but she wanted to have more than mere physical attraction. To Aum-La, the brief moments she had coupled with male Humans had been comparable to a fuel fire; Bright, passionate, but brief and unfulfilling.

It did not fill her large heart with radiating comfort, it didn’t make it thrum with passion, it just… took the edge off, if just for a moment. Aum-La thought back to her most recent coupling, taking into her bed a rather tall Human with shortly shaved hair and the muscles only a welder could have.

He had been thorough, but there wasn’t any… *lingering warmth*. He had done his duty, sure, and she had gotten what she had been after, but it felt like she had a side salad for dinner when she had the hunger for an entire meal.

Aum-La sighed unhappily, resting the tip of her draconic nose on the edge of her cup, closing one set of eyes as she looked down at the data-slate.

She was lonely. An absurd thing to say for a Skalathir in Human space, but it was true.

She had spent months upon months reading Human romances, falling in a near obsessive love with finding a being of flesh and blood that could make her feel the same way those pages did. Aum-La had been, and still was, fascinated by the idea of someone who saw her from within, not just the strong muscles, curvy hips, and large chest that nearly all Skalathir were blessed with.

Her good friend Alakaza was down in Georgia somewhere and was always tempting her with a visit, but the red-scaled Skalathir had been dabbling in so much Human flesh that she needed near weekly check ups. Alakaza was one of the few Skalathir females to have a small harem of Human males, something that Aum-La found deeply distasteful… if not disgusting.

She felt bad enough as it was, taking a Human partner every month or so just to cure the boredom for a little while, but having a stable of the hairy beasts nearly made her stomach turn. Aum-La wanted something special, and *real*, not a gaggle of fancies to pass.

Aum-La sadly sighed out as she came to the final message, just a slog of come-ons and corny pick-up lines, and she tossed her data-slate down onto her bedside table.

She sat there on her bed, laying against her pillows as she stared up at the metal ceiling of her quarters; She had been lonely as an armor forger too, the male Skalathir finding her too honest, too blunt, too *wordy*. Human males didn’t care if she was mean directly to their faces, it didn’t stop them from trying to climb the *mountains* and play amongst the *peaks*, as Alakaza had once put it.

Aum-La took the final sip from her cup and set it down beside her data-slate, wriggling her shoulders back and forth to sink further down into the little nest of pillows.

Who would she want, anyway? The daring Human bad boy of dark moods? A gallant that opens the door for her and treats her as a queen? A rough and tumble country boy who farms all day and then comes later in the night to plant seed…

She giggled at the last one; She had gotten into the more naughty novels favored by female Humans, and had found them quite entertaining. Humans in general told good stories, something that very few in the galaxy could actually manage. She ran her blue-scaled hands up and down her pale blue belly in thought, thinking back to one archetype she always found herself hounding after in books.

The easy-going veteran.

Aum-La smiled to herself as she laced her fingers together, remembering the many novels she had read involving such a type. They were hard, like her, blunt, honest, but weren’t so hard headed. So rigid.

She just hoped she found one before her scales started to fray. Life was long for a Skalathir, but she was not the young age of forty anymore…

Her sleep was a blink, a closing of eyes in the darkness, then opening them back to the darkness when her alarm went off.

She didn’t feel rested at all, just wrapped up in warm blankets when another warm body was needed.

Aum-La sighed and unfurled herself from her bed, grunting in annoyance as she slipped her tank top back over her exposed breasts; Human clothes of this type were really only made for male Humans, and while there were very little issues with female clothing, tank tops proved troublesome bedwear for a heavy chested Skalathir.

Her alarm going off at 0700 meant she had an hour and a half before the class showed up, so she indulged herself in one of the lesser-appreciated Human food items; Oatmeal.

Aum-La preferred hers with chocolate chips and cashews, enjoying it with a tall measure of black coffee. She had tried many foods of Earth, and was always surprised how it both tasted good, and offered her no distress of the organs. Eating Kafya nutritional bars had always made her feel painfully bloated, and Pwah grains gave her dreadful headaches.

The same could not be said of Earth; She could drink a gallon of milk, eat a bowl of grains, then pound down four protein bars all without even a passive gurgle from her stomach. She enjoyed coffee most of all, though she loved the lighter roasts for their more delicate nature. The first week she had been aboard the station, she alone had drank thirty seven gallons of coffee, guzzling it down while working with her students.

She also gained a rather odd addiction to yogurt, something she always ate at lunch with fresh fruit.

With her breakfast finished, she took off her bed clothes and looked at herself in the mirror, turning on her draconic heel and toe to look at herself; She had lost some muscle weight since she wasn’t forging every day for weeks on end, and she still held her figure well. But, her *butt* had gotten a little larger despite the tuck at her waist, and that made her furrow her brows.

Large posteriors were seen as a mark of the “lazy”, as the Skalathir must have been sitting down too much, not moving around while working in the forges or the shipyards. Aum-La ran her hands down her scale-smooth cheeks, clicking her tongue as she gave her rump a wobble with her fists. 

“Damn it all…” Aum-La muttered angrily, as she had been nearly nine inches smaller when she had first arrived. “I’m going to have to go to the gym more… at least now we have an all female one.”

With an angry stomp of feet she ripped a pair of jeans off their hanger and slipped them on, though there was a little more tugging and pulling than she would have liked; She had been buying pants woven with spandex due to her bulky leg muscles, and they were starting to become quite bothersome in terms of pulling them over her haunches.

She grabbed another sweater, a scarf, her favorite foot wrappings, and stepped out her quarter’s door.

Much like the Kafya, Skalathir feet were not conducive to normal footwear; Kafya were able to wear “paw boots”, but the Skalathir had to settle with foot rappings made of leather and wool. They were still comfortable, and needingly warm in these cold station environments, but they were not nearly as convenient. 

The station, First Horizon, was always chilly, but that was a side effect of just floating in space; Its blue-flash star battery generated a ton of heat to power the station and its magnetic field, as well as power an artificial gravity well so they didn’t have to *float* everywhere, but some of that heat was passed around to try and keep the station warm. It barely kept the station at sixty seven UAA degrees, but it was better than nothing.

The gravity was always the first thing students bitched about anyway; First Horizon was set at Earth gravity, while nearly all stations in the IDC functioned at maybe *half* of that.

Aum-La found her new classroom, walked down to her desk, and sat down into it, tapping along a small pad. After ten minutes there was the chirrup of a delivery drone, the multi-armed automaton trundling down the stairs on its six wheels.

“Good morning!” It trilled out with its electronic voice, pulling a vanilla latte from its heated compartment. “Vanilla latte for Aum-La!”

Aum-La smiled at the little thing, taking the cup. “Thank you.”

“Have fun with the new students!” It chirped out again, trundling back up the steps with rapid clunks before drifting around her open door to the hallway.

“Oh, it’s one of the artificial beings!” Came a voice from the hallway, Aum-La looking up as she blew on the open spout of her large coffee drink.

“Good morning!”

“Good morning!” An apparently giggling crowd of students said, likely fresh off the shuttles that morning and having just gotten their birthings.

“I must *away*!” The delivery drone called out dramatically, likely holding its arms to its chassis if Aum-La had to guess; The A.I. beings did love having fun. “There are quests to be done! Packages fetched! The hungry, fed!”

The giggling and chatter continued as the drone likely sped off down the hallway, and the students turned the corner into the classroom. The first two, a pair of Pwah, halted in the doorway when they got their first look at Aum-La sipping on her coffee.

“Whoa! A Skalathir!” The female yelled out, then actually pointed at Aum-La. “She’s huge!”",5,1746629698.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

    Ooh, black and yellow!
    Let's shake it up a little.
    Barry! Breakfast is ready!
    Coming!
    Hang on a second.
    Hello?
    Barry?
    Adam?
    Can you believe this is happening?
    I can't.
    I'll pick you up.
    Looking sharp.
    Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
    Sorry. I'm excited.
    Here's the graduate.
    We're very proud of you, son.
    A perfect report card, all B's.
    Very proud.
    Ma! I got a thing going here.
    You got lint on your fuzz.
    Ow! That's me!
    Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
    Bye!
    Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
    Hey, Adam.
    Hey, Barry.
    Is that fuzz gel?
    A little. Special day, graduation.
    Never thought I'd make it.
    Three days grade school, three days high school.
    Those were awkward.
    Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
    You did come back different.
    Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
    Hear about Frankie?
    Yeah.
    You going to the funeral?
    No, I'm not going.
    Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
    Don't waste it on a squirrel.
    Such a hothead.
    I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
    I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
    That's why we don't need vacations.
    Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
    Well, Adam, today we are men.
    We are!
    Bee-men.
    Amen!
    Hallelujah!
    Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
    please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
    Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
    That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
    Will we pick our job today?
    I heard it's just orientation.
    Heads up! Here we go.
    Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
    Wonder what it'll be like?
    A little scary.
    Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
    This is it!
    Wow.
    Wow.
    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
    Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
    That girl was hot.
    She's my cousin!
    She is?
    Yes, we're all cousins.
    Right. You're right.
    At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
    These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
    What do you think he makes?
    Not enough.
    Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
    What does that do?
    Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
    Saves us millions.
    Can anyone work on the Krelman?
    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
    But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
    But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
    The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
    What's the difference?
    You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
    So you'll just work us to death?
    We'll sure try.
    Wow! That blew my mind!
    ""What's the difference?""
    How can you say that?
    One job forever?
    That's an insane choice to have to make.
    I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
    Why would you question anything? We're bees.
    We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
    You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
    Like what? Give me one example.
    I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
    Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
    Wait a second. Check it out.
    Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
    Wow.
    I've never seen them this close.
    They know what it's like outside The Hive.
    Yeah, but some don't come back.
    Hey, Jocks!
    Hi, Jocks!
    You guys did great!
    You're monsters!
    You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
    I wonder where they were.
    I don't know.
    Their day's not planned.
    Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
    You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
    Right.
    Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
    It's just a status symbol.
    Bees make too much of it.
    Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
    Those ladies?
    Aren't they our cousins too?
    Distant. Distant.
    Look at these two.
    Couple of Hive Harrys.
    Let's have fun with them.
    It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
    Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
    He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
    Oh, my!
    I never thought I'd knock him out.
    What were you doing during this?
    Trying to alert the authorities.
    I can autograph that.
    A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
    Yeah. Gusty.
    We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
    Six miles, huh?
    Barry!
    A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
    Maybe I am.
    You are not!
    We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
    What do you think, buzzy-boy?
    Are you bee enough?
    I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
    Hey, Honex!
    Dad, you surprised me.
    You decide what you're interested in?
    Well, there's a lot of choices.
    But you only get one.
    Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
    Son, let me tell you about stirring.
    You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
    You get yourself into a rhythm.
    It's a beautiful thing.
    You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
    maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
    You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
    That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
    Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
    Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
    I'm not trying to be funny.
    You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
    You're gonna be a stirrer?
    No one's listening to me!
    Wait till you see the sticks I have.
    I could say anything right now.
    I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
    Let's open some honey and celebrate!
    Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!
    I'm so proud.
    We're starting work today!
    Today's the day.
    Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
    Yeah, right.
    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
    Is it still available?
    Hang on. Two left!
    One of them's yours! Congratulations!
    Step to the side.
    What'd you get?
    Picking crud out. Stellar!
    Wow!
    Couple of newbies?
    Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
    Make your choice.
    You want to go first?
    No, you go.
    Oh, my. What's available?
    Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
    Any chance of getting the Krelman?
    Sure, you're on.
    I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
    Wax monkey's always open.
    The Krelman opened up again.
    What happened?
    A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
    Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
    Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
    Oh, this is so hard!
    Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
    Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
    Barry!
    All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
    What happened to you?
    Where are you?
    I'm going out.
    Out? Out where?
    Out there.
    Oh, no!
    I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
    You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
    Another call coming in.
    If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
    Hey, guys.
    Look at that.
    Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
    Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
    It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
    Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
    Sign here, here. Just initial that.
    Thank you.
    OK.
    You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
    So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
    Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
    Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
    That's awful.
    And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
     All right, launch positions!
    Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
    Black and yellow!
    Hello!
    You ready for this, hot shot?
    Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
    Wind, check.
    Antennae, check.
    Nectar pack, check.
    Wings, check.
    Stinger, check.
    Scared out of my shorts, check.
    OK, ladies,
    let's move it out!
    Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
    All of you, drain those flowers!
    Wow! I'm out!
    I can't believe I'm out!
    So blue.
    I feel so fast and free!
    Box kite!
    Wow!
    Flowers!
    This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
    Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
    Roses!
    30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
    Stand to the side, kid.
    It's got a bit of a kick.
    That is one nectar collector!
    Ever see pollination up close?
    No, sir.
    I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
    See that? It's a little bit of magic.
    That's amazing. Why do we do that?
    That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
    Cool.
    I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
    Copy that visual.
    Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
    Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
    Affirmative.
    That was on the line!
    This is the coolest. What is it?
    I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
    It smells good.
    Not like a flower, but I like it.
    Yeah, fuzzy.
    Chemical-y.
    Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
    My sweet lord of bees!
    Candy-brain, get off there!
    Problem!
    Guys!
    This could be bad.
    Affirmative.
    Very close.
    Gonna hurt.
    Mama's little boy.
    You are way out of position, rookie!
    Coming in at you like a missile!
    Help me!
    I don't think these are flowers.
    Should we tell him?
    I think he knows.
    What is this?!
    Match point!
    You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
    Yowser!
    Gross.
    There's a bee in the car!
    Do something!
    I'm driving!
    Hi, bee.
    He's back here!
    He's going to sting me!
    Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
    He blinked!
    Spray him, Granny!
    What are you doing?!
    Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
    I gotta get home.
    Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
    Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
    Ken, could you close the window please?
    Ken, could you close the window please?
    Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
    Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
    What was that?
    Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
    That is diabolical.
    It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
    What's number one? Star Wars?
    Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
    No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
    When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
    There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
    I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
    I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
    Wait! Stop! Bee!
    Stand back. These are winter boots.
    Wait!
    Don't kill him!
    You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
    Why does his life have less value than yours?
    Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
    I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
    My brochure!
    There you go, little guy.
    I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
     Put that on your resume brochure.
    My whole face could puff up.
    Make it one of your special skills.
    Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
    Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
    Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
    Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
    You could put carob chips on there.
    Bye.
    Supposed to be less calories.
    Bye.
    I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
    All right, here it goes.
    Nah.
    What would I say?
    I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
    I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
    Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
    No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
    How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.
    Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
    Hi!
    I'm sorry. You're talking.
    Yes, I know.
    You're talking!
    I'm so sorry.
    No, it's OK. It's fine.
    I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.
    Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
    This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!
    I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.
    And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.
    That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.
    Yeah.
    I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!
    I just want to say I'm grateful.
    I'll leave now.
    Wait! How did you learn to do that?
    What?
    The talking thing.
    Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.
    That's very funny.
    Yeah.
    Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
    Anyway... Can I... get you something?
    Like what?
    I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?
    I don't want to put you out.
    It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
    It's just coffee.
    I hate to impose.
    Don't be ridiculous!
    Actually, I would love a cup.
    Hey, you want rum cake?
    I shouldn't.
    Have some.
    No, I can't.
    Come on!
    I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
    Where?
    These stripes don't help.
    You look great!
    I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
    Are you all right?
    No.
    He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.
    He finally gets there.
    He runs up the steps into the church.
    The wedding is on.
    And he says, ""Watermelon?
    I thought you said Guatemalan.
    Why would I marry a watermelon?""
    Is that a bee joke?
    That's the kind of stuff we do.
    Yeah, different.
    So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
    About work? I don't know.
    I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.
    I know how you feel.
    You do?
    Sure.
    My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
    Really?
    My only interest is flowers.
    Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.
    Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?
    You're in Sheep Meadow!
    Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
    No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.
    Why do girls put rings on their toes?
    Why not?
    It's like putting a hat on your knee.
    Maybe I'll try that.
    You all right, ma'am?
    Oh, yeah. Fine.
    Just having two cups of coffee!
    Anyway, this has been great.
    Thanks for the coffee.
    Yeah, it's no trouble.
    Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.
    Are you...?
    Can I take a piece of this with me?
    Sure! Here, have a crumb.
    Thanks!
    Yeah.
    All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.
    OK, Barry.
    And thank you so much again... for before.
    Oh, that? That was nothing.
    Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
    This can't possibly work.
    He's all set to go.
    We may as well try it.
    OK, Dave, pull the chute.
    Sounds amazing.
    It was amazing!
    It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.
    Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!
    Giant, scary humans!
    What were they like?
    Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
    They eat crazy giant things.
    They drive crazy.
    Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
    Some of them. But some of them don't.
    How'd you get back?
    Poodle.
    You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.
    You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.
    Well...
    Well?
    Well, I met someone.
    You did? Was she Bee-ish?
    A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
    No, no, no, not a wasp.
    Spider?
    I'm not attracted to spiders.
    I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.
    So who is she?
    She's... human.
    No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.
    Her name's Vanessa.
    Oh, boy.
    She's so nice. And she's a florist!
    Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
    We're not dating.
    You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
    She saved my life! And she understands me.
    This is over!
    Eat this.
    This is not over! What was that?
    They call it a crumb.
    It was so stingin' stripey!
    And that's not what they eat.
    That's what falls off what they eat!
    You know what a Cinnabon is?
    No.
    It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...
    Sit down!
    ...really hot!
    Listen to me!
    We are not them! We're us.
    There's us and there's them!
    Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?
    There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!
    You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!
    Thinking bee.
    Thinking bee.
    Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
    There he is. He's in the pool.
    You know what your problem is, Barry?
    I gotta start thinking bee?
    How much longer will this go on?
    It's been three days! Why aren't you working?
    I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.
    What life? You have no life!
    You have no job. You're barely a bee!
    Would it kill you to make a little honey?
    Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.
    Martin, would you talk to him?
    Barry, I'm talking to you!
    You coming?
    Got everything?
    All set!
    Go ahead. I'll catch up.
    Don't be too long.
    Watch this!
    Vanessa!
    We're still here.
    I told you not to yell at him.
    He doesn't respond to yelling!
    Then why yell at me?
    Because you don't listen!
    I'm not listening to this.
    Sorry, I've gotta go.
    Where are you going?
    I'm meeting a friend.
    A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
    Bye.
    I just hope she's Bee-ish.
    They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?
    To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!
    Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.
    A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?
    No. All right, I've got one.
    How come you don't fly everywhere?
    It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.
    Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
    All right, your turn.
    TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!
    You don't have that?
    We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.
    Oh, my.
    Dumb bees!
    You must want to sting all those jerks.
    We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.
    So you have to watch your temper.
    Very carefully.
    You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust.
    Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
    Yeah.
    What is wrong with you?!
    It's a bug.
    He's not bothering anybody.
    Get out of here, you creep!
    What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
    Yeah, it was. How did you know?
    It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
    You've really got that down to a science.
    I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
    I'll bet.
    What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?
    How did this get here? cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select?
    Is he that actor?
    I never heard of him.
    Why is this here?
    For people. We eat it.
    You don't have enough food of your own?
    Well, yes.
    How do you get it?
    Bees make it.
    I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it!
    There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!
    It's organic.
    It's our-ganic!
    It's just honey, Barry.
    Just what?!
    Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
    You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have!
    And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.
    I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!
    Hey, Hector. You almost done?
    Almost.
    He is here. I sense it.
    Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.
    You're busted, box boy!
    I knew I heard something.
    So you can talk!
    I can talk. And now you'll start talking!
    Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?
    I don't understand.
    I thought we were friends.
    The last thing we want to do is upset bees!
    You're too late! It's ours now!
    You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!
    You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!
    Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where!
    Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
    Crazy person!
    What horrible thing has happened here?
    These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now
    they're on the road to nowhere!
    Just keep still.
    What? You're not dead?
    Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?
    To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.
    I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
    I'm going to Tacoma.
    And you?
    He really is dead.
    All right.
    Uh-oh!
    What is that?!
    Oh, no!
    A wiper! Triple blade!
    Triple blade?
    Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
    Why does everything have
    to be so doggone clean?!
    How much do you people need to see?!
    Open your eyes!
    Stick your head out the window!
    From NPR News in Washington,
    I'm Carl Kasell.
    But don't kill no more bugs!
    Bee!
    Moose blood guy!!
    You hear something?
    Like what?
    Like tiny screaming.
    Turn off the radio.
    Whassup, bee boy?
    Hey, Blood.
    Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.
    Wow!
    I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours.
    Bees hang tight. We're all jammed in.
    It's a close community.
    Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.
    What if you get in trouble?
    You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!
    At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.
    Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
    You got to be kidding me!
    Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!
    Hey, guys!
    Mooseblood!
    I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
    Did you bring your crazy straw?
    We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.
    What is this place?
    A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.
    They are pinheads!
    Pinhead.
    Check out the new smoker.
    Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000!
    Smoker?
    Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.
    They make the honey, and we make the money.
    ""They make the honey, and we make the money""?
    Oh, my!
    What's going on? Are you OK?
    Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
    Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?
    Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.
    This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen!
    What is this?
    Oh, no!
    There's hundreds of them!
    Bee honey.
    Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!
    This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.
    Oh, Barry, stop.
    Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.
    Do these look like rumors?
    That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this?
    He's been talking to humans.
    What? Talking to humans?!
    He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!
    Make out? Barry!
    We do not.
    You wish you could.
    Whose side are you on?
    The bees!
    I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
    Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?
    I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!
    Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked
    your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.
    I remember that.
    What right do they have to our honey?
    We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
    Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
    Sting them where it really hurts.
    In the face! The eye!
    That would hurt.
    No.
    Up the nose? That's a killer.
    There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.
    Hive at Five, The Hive's only full-hour action news source.
    No more bee beards!
    With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Chung.
    Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
    And I'm Jeanette Ohung.
    A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!
    Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.
    Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
    Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from The Hive. I can't do this""?
    Bees have never been afraid to change the world.
    What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
    Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
    We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.
    How old are you?
    The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century.
    You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.
    It's a common name. Next week...
    He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...
    Next week...
    Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.
    Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.
    Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.
    In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!
    It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
    Honey, her backhand's a joke!
    I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
    Quiet, please.
    Actual work going on here.
    Is that that same bee?
    Yes, it is!
    I'm helping him sue the human race.
    Hello.
    Hello, bee.
    This is Ken.
    Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
    Why does he talk again?
    Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.
    But it's our yogurt night!
    Bye-bye.
    Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
    You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!
    Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.
    Frosting...
    How many sugars?
    Just one. I try not to use the competition.
    So why are you helping me?
    Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.
    Those are great, if you're three.
    And artificial flowers.
    Oh, those just get me psychotic!
    Yeah, me too.
    Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
    Bees must hate those fake things!
    Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.
    Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.
    This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
    I guess.
    You sure you want to go through with it?
    Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty!
    It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.
    What have we gotten into here, Barry?
    It's pretty big, isn't it?
    I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.
    You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?
    Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.
    What's the matter?
    I don't know, I just got a chill.
    Well, if it isn't the bee team.
    You boys work on this?
    All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.
    All right. Case number 4475,
    Superior Court of New York,
    Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session.
    Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?
    A privilege.
    Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?
    I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.
    Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.
    Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.
    If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean.
    I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!
    Talking bee!
    How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?
    They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids!
    Mr. Benson?
    Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives.
    Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys!
    I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are!
    I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!
    Call your first witness.
    So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.
    I suppose so.
    I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!
    Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.
    Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.
    I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?
    No.
    I couldn't hear you.
    No.
    No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
    They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
    You mean like this?
    Bears kill bees!
    How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away.
    So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. Where have I heard it before?
    I was with a band called The Police.
    But you've never been a police officer, have you?
    No, I haven't.
    No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.
    Oh, please.
    Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
    That's not his real name?! You idiots!
    Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.
    Thank you. Thank you.
    I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.
    I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
    Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?
    Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!
    This isn't a goodfella.
    This is a badfella!
    Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!
    Order in this court!
    You're all thinking it!
    Order! Order, I say!
    Say it!
    Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
    I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side.
    Are we doing everything right, legally?
    I'm a florist.
    Right. Well, here's to a great team.
    To a great team!
    Well, hello.
    Ken!
    Hello.
    I didn't think you were coming.
    No, I was just late I tried to call, but... the battery.
    I didn't want all this to go to waste,
    so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
    Oh, that was lucky.
    There's a little left. I could heat it up.
    Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
    So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.
    That's where I usually sit. Right... there.
    Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
    You think I don't see what you're doing?
    I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common.
    Do we?
    Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
    That's just what I was thinking about doing.
    Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
    I'm going to drain the old stinger.
    Yeah, you do that.
    Look at that.
    You know, I've just about had it with your little Mind Games.
    What's that?
    Italian Vogue.
    Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
    A lot of ads.
    Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?
    Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here!
    I love the smell of flowers.
    How do you like the smell of flames?!
    Not as much.
    Water bug! Not taking sides!
    Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!
    This is pathetic!
    I've got issues!
    Well, well, well, a royal flush!
    You're bluffing.
    Am I?
    Surf's up, dude!
    Poo water!
    That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings!
    Kenneth! What are you doing?!
    You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!
    We need to talk! He's just a little bee!
    And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
    Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?
     No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!
    Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
    My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!
    Goodbye, Ken.
    And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!
    I'm sorry about all that.
    I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!
    I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it.
    Oh, well.
    Are you OK for the trial?
    I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.
    We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
    Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...
    Yeah.
    Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.
    Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.
    You got the tweezers?
    Are you allergic?
    Only to losing, son. Only to losing.
    Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.
    What exactly is your relationship to that woman?
    We're friends.
    Good friends?
    Yes.
    How good? Do you live together?
    Wait a minute... Are you her little... bedbug?
    I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?
    Yeah, but...
    So those aren't your real parents!
    Oh, Barry...
    Yes, they are!
    Hold me back!
    You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?
    He's denouncing bees!
    Don't y'all date your cousins?
    Objection!
    I'm going to pincushion this guy!
    Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

Here’s what I ate 

- 10mL MCT oil 
- 4 eggs 
- shake with collagen, flax, chia, spirulina
- 3/4 cup yogurt

Electrolytes: I eat a fuck ton of salt. I’m actually cutting down a bit but still pass 2000mg easily, I’m probably closer to 4000. I used to be at near 8000. also take 2x200mg magnesium and ~300mg potassium 4x a day. 

I’m also supplementing NAC, Zinc, calcium, D3 and K2, B vitamins, iron and vitamin c, all 2x a week 

Also 0 coffee, nicotine, stimulants, weed or alcohol


So yogurt has 11g carbs, eggs have 4g, flax seed 3g, and chia seeds 2g. Already hit 20g for breakfast. 🙃

Do I need to cut yogurt too? And chia and flax seeds? Like seriously? 

Yesterday I had a bunch of boiled veggies. Okra, bok Choi, garlic, leafy greens, arugula, lettuce. The total was 13g carbs???? And a half an avocado is 6g??? 

So what do I need to cut? 

The headaches are killing me I can’t sleep or work!!!!! I also work out daily, so I don’t want to eat too little nutrients and hinder my recovery. But I can take a break for 4-5 days and just stop eating everything except meat if that’s the case.

**Why I built it**  
I kept missing pumps and eating rugs because I was juggling ten tabs, copy‑pasting contract addresses. After the third lost night and two coffee‑soaked keyboards, I accepted the obvious: humans are terrible at speed and repetition. A bot isn’t.  
  
So I hacked together something that 

1. reacts in milliseconds, 
2. screens out the most common rug tells before I even see the ping, and 
3. lets me fire the trade instead of a click‑maze.  

End goal: protect my sleep schedule without sacrificing the edge. 

**What it already does**

*  Scans Solana tokens in real-time, filtering by stuff like market cap, volume, holders, buys/sells, etc. 
* Advanced filters — e.g., minimum/maximum txn value, % increase in holders over 5 minutes, etc. Bot alerts when something matches your criteria

We're climbing to the 2nd floor of the Eiffel Tower so we've got our panoramic of the City. But, now, it's somewhat awkwardly only 5PM.

First timer in Paris and I'm a little overwhelmed as there literally so much options. Haha! Like, I could get tickets to go the Arc de Triomphe, find a wine/coffee bar and sip my choice next to the river or somewhere in a public garden. I could also be ambitious and drag my partner to Sacre-Coeur. Sadly, the Palais Garden is closed in the afternoon so that was out. 

It will be May 18th if that helps with suggestions! My partner also loves creepy (we're going to the Catacombs later), so anything like that would be awesome.

These suggestions are absolutely fabulous. Thank you so much. I'm going to slide going up the Tower just before sunset and watch it go down and see what my partner says! Such a great suggestion.",12,1746629199.0,ParisTravelGuide,31,0.93,False

I needed to ask a question regarding how to order iced coffee. I did read other posts regarding ordering iced coffee, but I did not find what I was really looking for.

What I want is an ""Iced coffee with liquid sugar and creme"".  
I have been ordering this way since 2010s, and alot of times staff seem to not know what that is. I asked some staff here and there how to do it, and multiple people told me to order ""Iced coffee, plain"". But that started people giving me iced coffee with just creme. Other than that, I got different reactions from them:

1. ""Liquid sugar? What is that?"".  
2. ""What do you mean? You have to tell me what flavor you want"".  
3. Put regular sugar, and it is all on bottom.

I even told some of them to use the pump with black color as I learned that the liquid sugar is black color. But also did not work many times because they would tell me they don't have that (some without even wanting to look).

Is there any phrase I can use so almost all staff can understand what I want? I really need help because that is the best iced coffee out there. And I really want to reduce down # of times that I have to go back inside to have them correct my order by me trying to explain that there is indeed liquid sugar that McDonalds carry.

Any help or tip would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",4,1746629186.0,McDonaldsEmployees,10,1.0,False

Shay  
  
The engine of my old car sputters as I pull into the parking lot of our run-down apartment complex. The glow of the streetlamp flickers above, casting long shadows over the cracked pavement. I grip the plastic bag in the passenger seat—Shawn’s cigarettes. He’d called me earlier, slurring his words, demanding I stop on my way home. I didn’t argue. It’s easier that way.  
  
I step out and sling my purse over my shoulder, fumbling in the dark to dig out my keys. The metal staircase groans beneath my weight as I make my way up to our second-floor unit. I pause for a moment outside the door, inhaling deeply, bracing myself. I never know what to expect. Then, I finally push it open.  
  
The stench of stale beer and sweat hits me first. Shawn is sprawled across the couch, one arm dangling off the side, his chest rising and falling in heavy, uneven breaths. An empty bottle teeters on the coffee table next to an overflowing ashtray. His once clean-cut jawline is now hidden beneath an overgrown beard, and his muscular frame has softened, the start of a beer gut pressing against his old military-issued t-shirt.  
  
I set the cigarettes on the counter without a word. He doesn’t stir. Good.  
  
I slip into our bedroom, pulling the door shut behind me. The bare lightbulb dangles from the ceiling. I tug the wobbly chain, and the harsh yellow light flickers to life. The cover is missing—shattered in Shawn’s last fit of rage. My stomach twists at the memory, the way his voice had turned venomous, his hands gripping too tight.  
  
I peel off my work clothes, wincing as my sleeve brushes against my arm. The bruise is already darkening—a sick shade of purple blooming beneath my skin. I swallow down the lump in my throat and grab a long, thin black sweater from the closet. The sleeves are just enough to hide the evidence. Paired with my flare-leg jeans, it’s enough to make me feel normal, at least for tonight.  
  
I slip on my clothes while my mind drifts somewhere else. Somewhere I try not to go too often.  
  
Back to when things were good.   
  
Shawn was my high school sweetheart. The boy with the easy smile and the confident stride. The one who made me feel safe, like we had the whole world ahead of us. We got engaged right after graduation, young and in love, convinced that nothing could break us. That summer, he enlisted, and I stood by him, proud and terrified all at once.  
  
His first deployment changed everything, though.  
  
He was on his very first mission. He had called me the night before to tell me. I was so scared, but he said everything would be okay. That day, they were fighting some rogue enemies. One threw a grenade and it went off near him. He survived, but his leg was shattered, and his body was riddled with shrapnel. Months of surgeries, painkillers, and physical therapy followed. But the worst damage wasn’t the kind that could be seen on an X-ray.  
  
When he finally came home, he wasn’t him anymore. The light in his eyes had dimmed, replaced by something sharp and distant. The man who used to pull me into his arms and swear we’d take on the world together barely looked at me now. He drank to numb the pain, to silence whatever demons followed him home. And when the alcohol wasn’t enough, the anger took over.   
  
I shake my head, trying to push the memories away.  
  
I smooth back my bleach blonde hair into a high pony, swipe some concealer under my tired blue eyes, blend out the exhaustion, and fix my smudged eyeliner. The mirror reflects a girl I barely recognize—someone who has learned to move in silence, to avoid waking the beast that now sleeps on our couch.  
  
I slip out the door, quiet as a whisper, before Shawn even realizes I was here.  
  
I pull into the nearly empty lot of the bar, the neon sign buzzing faintly above the entrance. At least it looks like it’ll be a slow night. I kill the engine and lean back for a moment, rubbing my temples. My body already aches from the long shift at the diner, my feet sore from hours of running plates and refilling coffee cups. But there’s no time to rest. No with the bills piling up daily on the side table. The words ""LATE"" boldly printing in bright red seeming to mock her.  
  
Pushing open the car door, I step into the cool night air and head inside, the familiar scent of whiskey and stale smoke wrapping around me. Tony, the owner, stands behind the bar, a rag in one hand and a glass in the other, his usual routine. He glances up as I tie my apron around my waist.  
  
“I thought you were coming in at five?” he asks, his thick brows pulling together.  
  
I wince. “I know, I’m sorry. The diner needed me for another thirty minutes.”  
  
Tony exhales through his nose, but there’s no real anger in his expression. Just something softer—understanding. “It’s fine, kid. Don’t worry about it.” He tosses the rag onto the counter and grabs his keys. “You got it from here?”  
  
“Yeah,” I nod. “Have a good night.”  
  
He pats the counter twice before heading out, the front door creaking shut behind him.  
  
I let out the breath I didn’t even realize I was holding.  
  
The silence of the bar stretches around me. No rowdy crowds yet, no booming laughter or clinking glasses. Just the low hum of a country song playing from the old jukebox in the corner. I take a moment to just be, leaning against the counter, letting the exhaustion settle before the night picks up.   
  
Then, with a deep breath, I push off the bar and get to work.  
  


# Tortured Twilight

Shay:  
  
My hands gripped the steering wheel, knuckles turning nearly white, but even that small sensation barely registered in my numb mind. The hours of the double shifts were weighing on me, pulling me down like invisible chains. Every inch of my body screamed for rest, for a moment to just collapse and breathe without the burden of everything hanging over me.  
  
My eyelids tried to flutter closed, the road ahead a blur as I tried to refocus on the never ending road ahead in me. The low hum of the engine, the rhythmic whoosh of the tires against the pavement, and the soft, steady beat of my pulse were the only things keeping me tethered to the present. But even those felt like they were slipping away, as though I were floating outside my own body.   
  
Somehow, I kept driving, the distance between me and home shrinking, though I had no idea how I’d made it this far. The exhaustion was a thick fog clouding my thoughts, and I couldn’t remember the last time I felt awake, truly awake.  
  
But then, suddenly, the familiar street signs appear, and the dull ache in my chest lightens just a little. Home.   
  
I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. The car slowed as I pulled into the drive on my dreary apartment complex, the tires squealing softly in protest against the long drive. I managed to park, though every movement felt like it took all the energy I had left.   
  
I stared at the second story when my front door stood for a moment, my gaze unfocused. The apartment was there, waiting, offering nothing but a place to fall into, but even that felt like too much right now. I leaned back and closed my eyes, trying to muster the last bit on strength I had left.  
  
Somehow, I gathered myself together to climb the stairs, unlock the door, step inside, and close it behind me. The silence of the apartment wrapped around me like a blanket, soft but heavy, and I could barely feel my legs move as I made my way to couch. I collapsed, my body sinking into the cushions, my mind already slipping into darkness.  
  
""Made it home,"" I whispered to herself, though I didn’t know if I meant it as a relief or a warning.  
  
My pulse thundered in my ears as I eased my shoes off my aching feet, crazing any sort of relief. The flickering oven clock in the distance told me it was already 1:25 AM. I stood up and made my way to the kitchen for a glass of water before bed. I walked to the sink and set my purse on the counter. I grabbed a glass from the cupboard and turned the sink on. I was mindlessly watching the running water fill my cup when I felt it—cold, hard pressure at my throat. Before I could react, I was slammed against the wall, my glass shattering against the hardwood floor. My back hit it with a sickening thud, my last bit of breath being cast from my lungs. His grip was brutal. His fingers dug into my neck, cutting off my air in short, desperate gasps.  
  
“Where the hell have you been?” Shawn’s voice was slurred, rough with alcohol. He reeked of it, of whiskey and something else, something darker. His breath burning against me, hot and foul against her skin.   
  
“Work,” I choked out, my voice strained, tears rimming my tired, red eyes, treating to slip any moment. I knew it wouldn’t be enough to calm him. Nothing ever was.   
  
“No,"" he spat, the word a bitter accusation. “You’ve been with him, haven’t you? Your precious boyfriend. You’ve been gone all day, don’t lie to me.”  
  
I shook my head frantically, my heart hammering. “No, Shawn... I came straight home after work. You were asleep. I swear.""  
  
The grip on my throat tightened, the world narrowing as my feet barely touched the floor. My head spun from the pressure. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think. Every attempt at speaking felt like it might be my last.   
  
“Stop it!” I gasped, her voice barely a whisper. ""Please, Shawn, please...."" the words coming out in desperation.   
  
He didn’t listen. His palm came down with a sickening crack against my cheek, and my vision blurred as a sharp pain exploded through my face. Blood poured from my lip, warm and sticky, dripping down my chin. I touched my face, my fingers trembling against the sting.   
  
He dropped me like a ragdoll, and I crumpled to the floor, gasping for air. The shattered glass cutting into my knees, but I couldn't think about that right now.   
  
Shawn turned without a word, leaving me there in the cold, silent apartment. The door slammed behind him, leaving nothing but the echo of it in his wake.  
  
I stayed on the floor for a moment longer, too numb to move, too shocked to fully process what had just happened. Blood dripped from my lip, but it didn’t feel like my body. Nothing did. All I could think about was the door, the silence that swallowed me whole, and how everything was always the same.  
  
The silence that followed was suffocating, pressing against my chest like a weight I couldn’t lift. My body ached, my lip throbbed, and the ghost of his hand still lingered around my throat.   
  
I forced myself to move, one step at a time, my limbs heavy as if they belonged to someone else. I made my way to the bathroom, barely recognizing my own reflection in the mirror. My cheek was red, already beginning to bruise, and a thin trail of blood ran from my lip. My eyes looked hollow—empty. Like I wasn’t even in my own body anymore.   
  
Shawn was gone. For now. That was all that mattered.    
  
I turned the shower on and let the steam fill the room before peeling off my clothes. Each movement felt slow, deliberate, like I was afraid my body might shatter from the effort. When I stepped under the stream, the hot water hit my skin, and I sucked in a sharp breath. It stung, burning against the fresh wounds, but I didn’t move away.   
  
I watched as my blood spiraled down the drain, mixing with the water, disappearing as if it had never been there. I wished it were that easy—to let everything wash away, to be clean, new, whole. But no amount of scrubbing could fix what was broken inside me.   
  
I leaned against the cool tile, pressing my forehead against it, my breath shaky. I felt like a shell of myself. Hollow. Helpless.   
  
Tears burned at the edges of my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. Crying wouldn’t change anything. It never did.  
  


# Another Day

I jolted awake, my chest rising and falling in quick, panicked breaths. The nightmare was always the same—Shawn, the man I once loved, smiling at me like he used to, his touch soft, his voice warm. And then, in an instant, he twisted into something else, something dark, something cruel. His hands weren’t gentle anymore. His voice wasn’t sweet. It was a monster’s voice, full of rage, full of force and demanding control of me.    
  
I shook off the lingering terror and glanced at the clock. 11 AM. My body ached, a cruel reminder of the night before. Every movement sent a dull throb through my limbs, but I couldn’t stay here. Lying in bed, letting the weight of everything keep me trapped—I refused.    
  
I had work. Again.    
  
Tony had given me extra hours, and I wasn’t about to waste them. A twelve-hour shift on a Friday meant good tips, which meant I could finally catch up on rent. That was all that mattered right now—surviving.    
  
I dragged myself to the mirror, wincing as I caught sight of the bruise blooming on my cheek. It was deep, ugly, impossible to ignore. My busted lip was worse, the cut raw against my pale skin. I sighed, running my fingers through my bleach-blonde hair.    
  
Curls. Maybe curls would help.    
  
I took the time to style my hair into soft, bouncy waves, letting them fall around my face, hoping they would at least distract from the bruising. Concealer did what it could, covering most of the discoloration, but nothing could hide my lip. Whatever. It wasn’t like anyone cared.    
  
I pulled on a black bodysuit, pairing it with leather leggings that hugged my curves. A stack of silver chain chokers around my neck felt like armor, like something that made me feel stronger, even if it was just an illusion. My Converses were the final touch—comfortable enough to survive the long hours ahead.    
  
Good enough for today.    
  
I grabbed my keys, locking the door behind me as I stepped into the dull morning light. Another long shift, another day of pretending. At least work gave me something else to focus on. At least there, I could be someone other than the girl trapped in this life.  
  
I climbed into my car, the engine sputtering to life as I pulled onto the road. The gas needle hovered on E, the warning light glowing like it was mocking me. Just one more thing to deal with.    
  
With a frustrated sigh, I pulled into the closest gas station, my mind already calculating how much I could spare for gas. I reached into my purse, rummaging through the pockets, only to come up empty. My stomach sank.    
  
Shawn. He had taken my tips.    
  
I clenched my jaw, forcing back the anger bubbling in my chest. Of course, he had. I should’ve known better than to leave anything where he could find it.    
  
Thankfully, I wasn’t completely out of luck. I kept a few bills stashed away in my car for emergencies—because with Shawn, there were always emergencies. I reached under the seat, pulling out a crumpled twenty. It wasn’t much, but it would get me through the day.    
  
I stepped out of the car and into the crisp autumn air, making my way inside. The coffee bar was my first stop. If I was going to survive another twelve-hour shift, caffeine was non-negotiable. I poured myself a large cup, the rich scent filling my senses, offering the smallest bit of comfort.    
  
I walked up to the counter, handing the cashier my money. She greeted me with a polite smile, but the moment her eyes landed on my face, it faltered.    
  
I hated that look. The pity. The way people always tried to pretend they weren’t staring.    
  
I swallowed hard, keeping my expression blank as she hesitated for just a second too long before handing me my change.    
  
“Have a good day,” she said softly.    
  
I forced a small nod, grabbing my coffee and heading back to my car without another word.    
  
I didn’t need her sympathy. I just needed to get through the day.  
  
I finally pulled into the parking lot behind Tony’s bar, easing into my usual spot. A few cars were already there, which meant it might be a good night for tips. I could only hope.    
  
I killed the engine and stepped out, stretching my sore limbs. The ache from last night still clung to me, a dull reminder of everything I tried to push down.    
  
Catherine was leaning against the back door, a cigarette dangling lazily from her lips. She was my age—young, wild, and free in ways I envied. Her red hair was braided into two perfect French braids, her green eyes sharp as they flicked over me.    
  
“You look like s\*\*t,” she said bluntly, exhaling a cloud of smoke. Cat wasn't one to sugar coat things. She have it to me straight, even when I didn't want to hear it.  
  
“Thanks, cat,” I muttered, rolling my eyes as I shut my car door. ""I didn't notice.""  
  
She didn’t laugh. She just stared at me, the usual mischief in her expression dimming slightly. “When are you gonna move in with me and get away from him?”    
  
I sighed, running a hand through my untamed curls. ""It's not that simple...""    
  
It never was. I wanted to leave—I did. But wanting and doing were two different things. There were too many pieces tangled together, too many ways it could go wrong.    
  
Cat scoffed, shaking her head as she took another drag of her cigarette. “It’s as simple as packing a bag and never looking back.”    
  
I finally reached her, yanking her cigarette from her and taking a couple long drags before handing it back. The smoke filling my lungs.   
  
If only.    
  
I didn’t say anything, just walked past her toward the back door. Because the truth was, I wasn’t sure if I even remembered how to leave.",1,1746629103.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Imagine this: you're walking down the street, sipping your iced coffee, and suddenly you spot it—a glowing orange machine humming quietly in the corner of a gas station. It's not an arcade cabinet. It's not a futuristic vending machine. It's a **Bitcoin ATM**, and it's here to change the way you think about money, one satoshi at a time.

Yes, folks. Bitcoin ATMs are no longer some mythological contraptions whispered about in Reddit threads. They're real, they're multiplying, and they’re making crypto more accessible than ever. But here’s the thing—while these ATMs are super handy for buying and selling Bitcoin, there’s still one little hiccup in the process that leaves some users scratching their heads…

**QR Codes.**

But don’t worry—we’ve got you covered. Keep reading to learn how Bitcoin ATMs and our trusty sidekick app, the [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), make crypto fast, easy, and actually kind of fun.

# What Even Is a Bitcoin ATM?

Let’s rewind for a second. A Bitcoin ATM (or BTM if you’re into acronyms) is a machine that allows users to buy or sell Bitcoin using cash or debit. Think of it like a traditional ATM, but instead of spitting out $20 bills, it lets you scoop up sweet, sweet sats (or sell them back for cold hard fiat).

Some BTMs are one-way (buy only), others are two-way (buy and sell), and many now support other popular cryptos like Litecoin and Ethereum. But for this article, let’s keep our eyes on the prize: **Bitcoin**.

Here’s the typical experience:

1. Walk up to the machine like you own the blockchain.
2. Tap “Buy Bitcoin.”
3. Enter how much you want to purchase.
4. Scan your wallet’s QR code.
5. Insert cash.
6. Boom—your BTC is on its way.

Sounds easy, right? It is—**if** you’ve got a QR code handy.

# Enter the Bitcoin QR Code Maker App 🪄

This is where our humble creation, the [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), comes in to save the day.

Picture this: You’re at a Bitcoin ATM, ready to buy. The machine asks for your wallet address. You dig around in your bag, pull out your phone, and… realize you’ve got your address saved as a long, jumbled string of letters and numbers. Great.

Do you really want to type in **1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa** while the guy behind you sighs audibly?

No. No you do not.

Instead, you pull up our slick little app, paste your Bitcoin address, and voilà: you’ve got a sharp, scannable QR code that the machine can read instantly. No typos. No stress. No public-key-induced headaches.

It’s fast, free, and doesn’t require you to download some shady software. Just hop over to [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), punch in your BTC address or payment details, and generate a QR code in seconds.

You can even customize it with a label or add a specific amount of BTC if you’re accepting payments. Want to print it out for your food truck, event booth, or lemonade stand? Go for it. Want to keep it digital and show it off on your phone like a boss? That works too.

# Why QR Codes Make Bitcoin Way More Fun

Let’s be honest—cryptocurrency can be intimidating, especially if you’re not deep in the DeFi mines 24/7. QR codes bridge that gap. They make crypto feel as easy as ordering tacos from a food truck (a very forward-thinking food truck, but still).

With QR codes, you're not fumbling with addresses or worrying if you got that one character wrong. You're just scanning and going. That’s the kind of simplicity we need if we want Bitcoin to go mainstream.

And Bitcoin ATMs + QR codes = a match made in decentralized heaven.

# Use Case Time! Here's How Real People Are Using Both

**1. First-Time Buyers**  
Curious about Bitcoin? A BTM is a great way to dip your toes in without having to mess with an exchange. With a QR code ready to go, even your grandma could grab some sats.

**2. Travelers & Expats**  
Stuck in another country without a bank account? BTMs can be a lifeline. Just use our QR code app to receive Bitcoin payments from friends or clients back home, then cash out at a nearby machine.

**3. Small Biz Owners**

Issues like we all have but the good outweighed the bad. I appreciated the small things. Morning air, the smell of hazelnut coffee, the freedom to play whatever songs I like on the freeway. Delicious food, events on the town, holidays, vacations etc. I quit my job back in October due to the high stress levels, disorganization, and impossible work load demands. Felt good to preserve my mental health. I had also been dealing with horrible menstrual cycles, heavy bleeding extreme mood swings etc. So I decided to get a birth control shot that would eliminate my cycle. Worst decision of my life. Caused chemical insomnia so I went two weeks without sleeping and didn't know how i survived. Ended up as an inpatient for a month then sent back to the real world to try to live like nothing ever happened. But I was traumatized and broken. By the experience, by the regret, the disappointment of trying to help myself but making things worse, by my family taking advantage of me and belittling me while I was being treated. So I never went back to normal life. Didn't apply for jobs. Didn't do any self care. Just sat around my house. Letting the bills pile up. After 4 months I now have an eviction notice on my door, and my truck was repoed out of my driveway last night. I regret not getting off my butt but at the same time life just didn't feel the same anymore. Basics felt like a chore, no longer wanting to be around family who was already toxic to begin with, wondering what obstacle I would run into next if i did get things in order. So this is it.

I am currently 6 wks pregnant!woohoo but I had 1 early miscarriage at 5 wks, last November. So this pregnancy is so precious and I want to do it right.   

I know I can just google for these but obviously google search is giving me way too much info and makes me anxious 😖

To moms out there, who already had/have experiences… can you guys please tell me the realistic “do”s  and “dont’s”?

Obviously drinking & smoking is a NO (thank God I dont drink or smoke) but like realistic ones will be appreciated!

Like using perfume, using certain type of shampoo, body lotions, pain medicines..etc…

Obv google tells me dont use anything that contains fragrances and etc but my friends told me they all used it without any issues. Obv, it’s always best to take precautions but OMG there are too many things to think about and it’s driving me crazy and yes I am a very anxious person in general. 

I also love coffee but I’ve been drinking iced decaf- and dramatic me thinking what if that barista forgot to do decaf … although 150-200mg caffein is okay during pregnancy but I rather not?? Ugh

My trusty Element has been chugging along since I bought it brand new in 2003 — it’s been a real trooper! But a couple of months ago, I drove through a deep puddle, and two days later… no start. The engine cranks but just won’t fire up. My mechanic spent a few days digging into it and is convinced the ECU/computer got wet and shorted out.

So here’s where I’m at: Do I give my old buddy a graceful retirement, or should I spring for an aftermarket computer and keep the adventure going? The engine itself is in good shape, it’s still rocking the original catalytic converter, and while the transmission slips sometimes, swapping out the pressure switch every couple of years has kept it rolling. The paint’s seen better days, but hey — that’s just character, right?

Would love to hear your thoughts! Worth saving, or time to say goodbye?

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday–my eighteenth–the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery. 

“Do you phn on making me wait all morning. Auren!” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room. 

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty–three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty–seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the amwual mating ball about a year ago. 

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare. 

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.” 

“It’s coming, Maris–I stopped myself, flinching, “I’ll get it right away.” 

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me 

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, that me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning” 

“Right.” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.” 

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.” 

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn’t a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna. 

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me. 

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine! 

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.” 

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest. 

After delivering the late and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I related to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered. 

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and Intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it. 

“That’s our mate! Siena said enthusiastically. “Go fast. I want my mute.’ 

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd. searching for the source. And then I saw hum… 

Alpha Bram Thome. 

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me failed as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul 

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly. 

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my cheat when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alphs. He was going in pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him. 

1 stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl park had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. “Mate,‘ I whispered, my cheeks flushing 

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me? 

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in hist gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated, 

“No, go to him! Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram. 

“Alpha Bram“” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side. 

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn’t even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips. 

My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I’d felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted

For years, I’d dreamed of this moment–the day I’d find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, therish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes, 

Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn’t even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house tours blurred my vision.

I had inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so him now! 

I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn’t stop bleeding. I didn’t know what to do or who to go to for comfort. 

Alpha Bram’s cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn’t even want to acknowledge me. 

Suddenly, the door opened.

Being an orphan had always been hard for me. Acconling to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Itram’s father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind einnigh to give me shelter in las par klusise and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram besame the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me park’s servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the park. I had to earn my living His busty gare would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap

Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. Dhurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crosses and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression. 

“Well, well” she said, stepping closer. “If it isn’t our little orphan, sniveling like a child.” 

I didn’t respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in tear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris 

“I know what happened,” she said, her voice dripping with venom. “You think you’re special because Bram is your mate! Let me tell you something. Muren” She crouched down, her face close to mine. “We knew it long back. But you’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing Bram doesn’t want you. He’ll reject you won enough, and when he dors, you’ll wish you’d never set foot in this pack 

I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears. 

“If you tell 

one–anyone–about this,” she continued, her voice low and dangerous, “I’ll make sure you regret it. Do you understand 

I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt. 

“Good. Now clean yourself up. You’re pathetic. I don’t want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you’ll regret it if they come to know the reason” Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out 

The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of rach other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me. 

When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn’t end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. “You are reassigned to work in the toiles” she barked at me. “Stay there until you get a new duty. Don’t you come out of that place!” 

I balked as I stared at her. “What?” Toilets were the worst place to work. 

She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. 

“Did y

Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn’t done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone’s scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.

It didn’t take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong but I

Seven days passed in darkness. My body ached from the cold stone floor, and hunger clawed at my stomach. The only company I had was my wolf, Siena, who tried to comfort me, though her own pain mirrored mine. 

But on the seventh day, the door opened. Reya stood there with her usual scorn.

“Shut up!” Reya shouted. When I scrambled back, she came over, pulled me roughly and dragged me out of the dungeon. “You dimwit,” she retorted. “Did you really think you could ever compete with Lady Maris? Now look how nicely she has got rid of you by convincing Alpha Bram. No one wants to marry Alpha Lucien. By offering you to him, she will win his alliance for Alpha Bram. And you? You’ll be nothing more than a breeder for the cursed Alpha. So it’s a neat little arrangement that benefits both packs beautifully ",1,1746628577.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False
1kgywzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1kgywzn/small_business_case_study_how_we_grew_our/,Small Business Case Study: How We Grew Our Instagram & TikTok with an AI Social Media Assistant (No Ad Spend!),"**Post Body:**  
Hi everyone! I co-own a small business (a boutique cafe + online store) and wanted to share our experience using an **AI “social media assistant”** to grow our Instagram and TikTok. We don’t have a dedicated marketing team – I’m basically the owner, barista, and unofficial social media manager all in one 🙃. Consistently creating content and growing on social was always a struggle while running day-to-day operations. A few months ago we tried something new (an AI tool) to help with our social media, and the results were surprising. Here’s the breakdown:

**Challenges:** We had an Instagram with \~500 followers that had stalled out, and a practically non-existent TikTok. We knew there was opportunity (our competitors were killing it on IG), but we lacked time and expertise. Hiring a social media pro wasn’t feasible for us. Posts were random and infrequent, and to be honest, I never knew what to put in captions or which hashtags to use. Engagement was low, and it felt like we were talking to a void.

**What We Did (AI to the Rescue):**

* **Content Plan & Calendar via AI:** We started using an AI-powered service that basically acted like a virtual social media manager. The first thing it did was analyze our business (coffee shop vibes, local community, artisan products) and suggest a content strategy. Suddenly I had a **content calendar**: e.g. Monday – post a behind-the-scenes of brewing coffee, Wednesday – a Reel of our best-selling pastry being made, Friday – spotlight a customer or employee, etc. It even gave me trending audio suggestions for the Reels. Having this plan was a game-changer; it took me from ad-hoc posting to a structured approach.
* **Consistent Posting (Made Easy):** The AI tool would nudge me when it was time to post and even draft caption ideas. Instead of scrambling, I often had a caption template ready (like a fill-in-the-blank story the AI wrote about our product) and just had to tweak it. We went from 1-2 posts/week on IG to 4-5 posts/week, and from nothing on TikTok to 3-4 videos/week. And honestly, it didn’t feel like more work – it felt **less** because I wasn’t overthinking every post. Consistency really helped us start showing up more in feeds.
* **Engagement & Hashtag Help:** I’ve never been great at knowing what hashtags to use or how to engage beyond posting. The assistant suggested a set of relevant hashtags for each post (mix of popular and niche ones) which improved our reach. It also identified a handful of local businesses and foodie influencers for us to interact with. I spent maybe 10 minutes a day liking and commenting on local community posts (as prompted by the AI). That little bit of consistent engagement made our cafe more visible to the local Instagram community without feeling like spam.
* **AI-Driven Collab Outreach:** This was something I wouldn’t have done on my own. The AI helped craft a friendly DM to a local food blogger and a fashion boutique (who often featured cafes) to propose collaborations. I honestly was nervous, but the messages it drafted were so well-worded and personalized (it mentioned a specific post of theirs that we loved, etc.), so I sent them. To my surprise, both responded! We ended up doing a little cross-promo with the boutique (we featured their products in our store, they shouted us out in their story) and the food blogger came in for a free coffee and posted a Reel review. Those brought in a wave of new followers and some new customers through the door too.

**The Results (2 Months Later):**

* Instagram: grew from \~500 to **1,800+** followers. 🎉 These are mostly local folks or people interested in coffee/baking. Our posts now get a lot more engagement (used to average 15-20 likes, now often 60-100+ likes, and more comments). We’ve even had a couple of posts hit the Explore page for local hashtags.
* TikTok: grew from 0 to **3,200** followers. One of our early TikTok videos went mildly viral (\~150k views on a latte art video set to a trending song). That gave us a big boost (people came to our profile, some followed, and a few local college students actually came by the cafe saying they saw us on TikTok!). Most of our other videos get a few thousand views, which is still way better than the \~100 views when we first started.
* Customer Impact: It’s hard to measure, but we did notice about a 15% increase in in-store sales over the period and a bump in online orders. New customers mentioned discovering us on IG/TikTok. At least 3 customers explicitly said a TikTok video brought them in (“I saw those cinnamon rolls on TikTok and had to try them!” 🤩). So the growth wasn’t just vanity metrics; it translated a bit into real business.
* **Time Spent:** Initially, I invested some time learning the AI tool and prepping content (maybe a few hours setting up). Now, I’d say I spend *less* time than before on social media, maybe 30-45 minutes per day total. The AI handles the strategy bits that used to suck up my time (what to post, when, what to hashtag, who to engage with). I basically execute the plan and spend more time interacting with comments (the fun part).",1,1746628560.0,smallbusiness,2,0.67,False

I've been dating my girlfriend for almost 3 years. We live together in a small apartment, and things were mostly great until last weekend when my entire world crashed down around me.

For context, her best friend from college has been staying with us for the past week. Let's just say she's always been flirty with both of us, making suggestive comments, but I brushed it off as her personality. My girlfriend always laughed it off too, saying ""that's just how she is.""

Friday night, we all went out drinking. Heavy drinking. We bar-hopped until 2 AM, and I was definitely the most intoxicated of the three of us. When we got home, I remember collapsing into bed while they stayed up talking in the living room. I passed out almost immediately.

Here's where shit gets messed up. I woke up around 4 AM to use the bathroom and noticed they were both in bed with me. I was on one edge, my girlfriend in the middle, and her friend on the other side. I didn't think much of it, figured they just crashed, and went back to sleep.

The next morning I checked my phone while they were still sleeping and saw that my girlfriend had accidentally sent me a text that was clearly meant for her friend. It said: ""Last night was incredible. I've never felt that way before. I can't believe we did that with him right there.""

My stomach dropped. I scrolled up and saw no previous texts in this thread, meaning she must have deleted their conversation history and accidentally sent this new message to me instead of her friend.

When they woke up, I acted normal, made coffee, and waited until her friend left to go shopping. Then I confronted my girlfriend. At first she denied everything, then tried to gaslight me saying I was crazy and paranoid. But when I showed her the text, she broke down.

She admitted they'd fooled around while I was passed out in the SAME BED. She swore it was just a drunk mistake, that she's not gay or bi, just ""curious,"" and it meant nothing. She begged me not to tell anyone and said they both feel terrible about it.

I lost it. I packed a bag and went to stay with my brother. She's been blowing up my phone saying I'm overreacting, that technically she didn't cheat because it wasn't with another guy, and that I should be ""flattered"" they were comfortable enough to ""explore"" with me there. Her friend even texted me saying I'm being a jerk for making my girlfriend feel bad about ""discovering herself.""

My brother thinks I should just break up with her and move on, but we share an apartment lease, most of our furniture, and even a cat. I don't know what to do.

AITA for feeling betrayed and refusing to talk to either of them? Am I overreacting to what they're calling a ""harmless drunk experiment""? I feel like I'm going crazy with them trying to spin this like I'm the problem for being upset about what they did literally inches away from me while I was unconscious.",1,1746628545.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

1kgyuwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTableCentral/comments/1kgyuwe/how_does_the_amazon_basics_tv_tray_4pack_perform/,How does the Amazon Basics TV Tray 4-Pack perform in daily use review?,"The **Amazon Basics CH01-0201-150-2P-A13 Portable TV Dinner Tray** came into my life when I was tired of juggling meals and work on a cramped coffee table. Honestly, the idea of a simple, foldable tray didn't sound all that exciting until I started using it every day. This set of four TV trays has been my reliable companion for dining while binge-watching or as a makeshift work desk during chaotic work-from-home days.

**Design and Build Quality**

I was pleasantly surprised by how sturdy these trays felt right out of the box. Each of the four trays is crafted from wood and comes in a light, natural finish that blends with most home decor setups. Despite the “basics” tag in the name, the design looks far from cheap. The foldable base allows the trays to be stored compactly on the included rack. Having a convenient storage solution for multiple trays is a game-changer for those who obsess over keeping their home clutter-free.  

These trays are sized perfectly at 15""D x 19""W x 26""H, offering enough surface area to accommodate a dinner plate, a drink, and even a small snack bowl. My kids even used it for their art projects, and surprisingly, the surface resisted minor scratches from crayons and markers. While the wood construction feels durable, I wouldn’t push the limit of its maximum weight capacity of 35 pounds.

[Check Amazon Basics CH01-0201-150-2P-A13 price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/p/b07mkqgjsw/)

**Practicality in Everyday Use**

The versatility of these trays is impressive. Over the last month, they've pulled double duty as dining tables when guests visit and as portable workspaces for my laptop. Folding them takes seconds, and they’re lightweight enough to carry across the room with ease. The flat top surface also makes it easy to clean up small spills—though, be warned, the wood isn’t water-resistant, so drying up quickly is crucial to avoid damage.

What I didn’t expect was the steady base even on carpeted floors. Unlike some wobblier models I’ve tried in the past, these are dependable even when fully loaded. However, if you're hoping to find stain resistance, you might be disappointed, as the natural finish isn’t exactly forgiving with certain food stains.

**Highlights**

- Compact storage rack with a matching natural finish for the four trays.
- Foldable design makes it easy to pack away and transport.
- Multipurpose use as a dinner tray, desk, or hobby station.
- Sturdy build with wide rectangular surface, accommodating various uses.
- Easy to clean after minor spills or crumbs.

**Flaws to Consider**

- Lacks water and stain resistance; spilled liquids need quick attention.
- Not customizable or resizable, which might be limiting for some.
- The finish, though pleasing, may not match every interior style.

**Other Options**

When comparing this product to similar options in this category, the **Winsome Alex Snack Table Set** came to mind. While it has a comparable foldable design, it leans more towards a traditional aesthetic with darker finishes. On the other hand, the **Lifewit Adjustable Tray Table** offers tilt functions and adjustable heights but sacrifices the elegant wooden look for a more functional, plastic design.

What sets the featured TV trays apart is the practical balance between their stylish wooden finish and the well-thought-out functionality of the compact storage rack. You won’t get the adjustability of higher-end alternatives, but for the price tag, they deliver value unmatched by those lacking a storage solution.

**Price Performance**

Keeping its features and overall durability in mind, this product falls under the category of “Affordable Quality.” These trays punch above their weight in terms of usability compared to similar products at a slightly higher price range. The inclusion of four trays plus a storage rack easily justifies the expense, especially for households that need portable yet stylish solutions for dining and work.

My friend and I plan to go paragliding at Bir Billing after our Rupin Paas trek in May . We are traveling from Sangla and are expected to reach Bir around 2-3 am . Please answer a couple of questions for me .
1. We would ideally like around 5 hours if sleep, complete paragliding,have breakfast and be on our way to Dharamkot  hopefully by 11 am . In that case , which hostel do you think would be closest ? Also would they be willing to admit us so late at night ?

2. One place of attraction we could visit if we plan to hang around till lunch ?

If you guys are feeling especially helpful, please give recommendations for good breakfast/ coffee places .

I decided to get the Deep 27 because I was intrigued after watching Aramse’s video about it.

Regarding the dripper: I’ve done two brews so far, and wow! The result is so nice and balanced, not as acidic as the V60, but well balanced with good flavor note separation and a pleasant body with a hint of sweetness. I wasn’t expecting such good results from the first two uses.

I followed a recipe I found online: https://wendstudio.shop/blogs/news/small-dose-pour-over-coffee-recipe-deep-27-flower-dripper 

I really wanted a dripper for small cups and very small doses, and this one is just phenomenal.

For grinding, I used the Kinu Phoenix with pour-over burrs. I also have a Varia VS6, so I’ll see if there’s a difference between the two.

First, I tried it with the Big Apple from Dak, and for the second brew, I used Saoko, a Geisha from Wide Awake, a small roaster from Belgium. Both brews turned out great!

As for Tanat, the aroma of their Carlos Vergara Chiroso is incredible, with raspberry🍇🌸 and floral notes, even though it was roasted just five days ago. I can’t wait to try it out!",19,1746628295.0,pourover,15,1.0,False

Hey, it’s me-your sky-gazing narrator, ready for a tale that’ll make your heart race!
Imagine this: one magical morning, before even the birds could blink,
Raindrops and stars swapped places-zap!-in a cosmic, sparkling wink!
Oh! The streets shimmered with twinkles, umbrellas caught galaxies bright,
While the sky, once so starry, dripped gentle silver light!

Look! Kids splashed through puddles that glowed with nebula dreams,
Each step sending ripples of laughter and moonbeam streams!
Grown-ups blinked at their coffee, “Is that Saturn in my cup?”
Even the grumpiest neighbor looked up-and his frown turned up!

I saw stardust on sneakers, constellations in every drain,
And the clouds-oh, the clouds!-sang a glittery refrain.
“Don’t just wish on a star-dance with it in the rain!”
I cheered, “Hey you! Don’t let wonder slip down the gutter-
Catch it, skip it, let your wild spirit flutter!”

When the sun peeked out, the stars and drops waved goodbye,
Promising to meet again, somewhere between puddle and sky.
So next time you see rain or gaze up at night,
Remember: magic can swap places-just hold your dreams tight!

My husband goes back to work in the office next week. We were lucky that he's had 4 months off to help me.
I've relied on him quite a bit. I ebf and baby won't take a bottle so I do all the night wakings but my husband will wake up in the morning and let me shower in peace.

I then eat breakfast and have a cup of coffee in peace.

Then I do tend to baby pretty much all day whilst my husband works from home (not strict though, he's able to step away whenever) upstairs.
My husband makes lunch for us or will take baby so I can. Then will make dinner. And clean.

This week, my husband has voiced that he's nervous how I'll function without him next week.
And before my son turned 4 months, I felt it would've been fairly easy as he could be in his bouncer or the carrier.

But in the last few days he's learned how to roll so he's started rolling in his bouncer which means his neck is all backwards and he cries because he's uncomfortable.

And he's been scream crying in the carrier.

He also scream cries during tummy time.

So there's absolutely nowhere for me to put him down so I can get anything done.

My husband went into the office this morning to give me a test drive. And I've broken down in tears three times. I feel at the closest edge ever. I just want to put my son down, get in the car and drive off a cliff.

How am I supposed to shower without my son breaking his neck in his bouncer?
How am I supposed to make lunch or eat if I can't put him down anywhere?
When am I supposed to have a break??

He only naps on me. We've spent the last 2 months trying to transfer him to the cot we have downstairs when he naps and he never transfers well, he always wakes up and then won't go back to sleep so he gets overtired.
Its much better for him to just sleep on me because I'm so desperate for peace and quiet.

I dont know how to tell my husband that I've failed his test today.
How do I go to the shop? Eat? Clean? Shower? Function like a human being if my baby outright refuses to be put down or worn?

I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Help me figure out what to do next?,"I was living and working in Germany for the past 3 years. My husband and I have been doing long distance in this time, with him mostly coming over to visit me a few times a year (I couldn't visit him due to the nature of my job, vs him having a home office job, hence why he travelled more).

In August of last year (2024) he asked me to move back to our home country because he was tired of doing long-distance and preferred life in our home country over life in Germany. I didn't want to give up and leave behind everything I had built over the three years of establishing myself in this new country, but weighing up my options, I chose him over my dream.

To give context to my situation - in April of last year, my husband and I discussed opening up our marriage to find sexual satisfaction elswewhere while we were living apart. We both agreed to give it a try, under the condition that, if either of us were no longer comfortable with the arrangement for any reason or for no reason whatsoever, we would end the agreement and cut all ties with any other people we might have engaged with.

after about 2 months I was no longer comfortable with the arrangement and asked him to stop seeing a woman he had started sleeping with. He resisted and defended his position, but after a while gave in and agreed to stop seeing her.

fast forward a month or so, and I find out he's still talking to her and meeting up for coffee dates etc. I was upset, but he promised me it was purely platonic, and there was no sexual activity going on. I didn't wan't him to keep seeing her on any level, but I knew I couldn't do much from across the globe, so I asked him to make it clear that, once we were back together, he would cut ties with her. He agreed.

Coming back to August 2024, he asked me to move back home to him. As mentioned, I reluctantly agreed and started the process of moving back. All this time I was under the impression that he was only seeing this woman platonically. Even that bothered me, and I had made it abundantly clear to him multiple times in emotional video calls where I was sobbing my eyes out, begging him to stop seeing her because of how it hurt me. Every time he told me I had nothing to worry about.

Now we're here, May 2025, and I learnt a couple of days ago that he has been having sex with her up until a week ago, and he still meets up with her in secret now.

I have spoken to him about it, and he keeps defending himself, saying that I can't satifsy him sexually, but that he still wants me to stay with him for the other aspects of the relationship, and that he should be able to keep seeing the other woman for sex. I am not comfortable with this, and I have told him to make a choice.

She always complains about me being a messy person, and I constantly try to better that side of me. She never seem to notice it however, there were times when I’d spend the entire day cleaning and prepare a nice meal and she’d come home and still make a comment about whatever she thought was out of place, I usually just ignore her at some point. 
We usually have a lot of days where we work from home and during which we have every meal together, our last meal usually comes at a time where the water is cut from the neighborhood which happens daily so we leave the dishes til the next morning. Most days we have no problem with that as we wake up together and would both head to the kitchen and one of us would clean while the other cooks which I enjoy very much because we have so much fun together. This morning I woke up, and it was already a rough start. I turned to her after her alarm went off and asked what should we make for breakfast as we always ask each other and agree on the same thing since she’s a picky eater, she snorted at me and said in a very disagreeable manner she wasn’t in the mood for breakfast and asked me to let her sleep. I got up and left the room and made myself a cup of coffee and went to work on something in the living room. I had been on a deadline so I figured since I didn’t know how much longer she wanted to sleep or what she wanted to have for breakfast I should just work on my stuffs. She woke up an hour later and when she found out I didn’t do the dishes and I made myself a cup of coffee she lost it. She said I should’ve done the dishes when I first went into the kitchen and not waited until she woke up for her to do them and that I added my cup and the dishes that I drank coffee to the dishes she would be washing. That was so not true because there were many times I’d do the dishes and breakfast or whatever meal it was and I never complained. There were a lot of times shed tell me she wasn’t in the mood to do anything and I’d go to the kitchen all alone happily picking the slacks. I am so bothered by the way she choose to talk about it and what’s worse is she got up and started doing the dishes and making breakfast at the same time and when I asked what she was doing she just ignored me. I tried to talk to her and she just stonewalled me so I made tea for her and left her to it and we aren’t talking since as I’m sitting in another room and she didn’t even bother to ask me to go eat. I ended up having some granola bar and locking myself in another room. I feel like she woke up on the wrong side of the bed and just decided to make the day rough for me, as I’ve done nothing wrong but I don’t know maybe I did. 
Another thing I’d like to add is I have had severe eczema and have been on treatment for the past few weeks and I am obligated to wear gloves every time I wash the dishes or cut veggies that’s why I prefer to once get into the kitchen do both the cleaning and food prep at once.

1kgyi8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kgyi8o/how_does_wacaco_nanopresso_portable_espresso/,How does Wacaco Nanopresso portable espresso maker compare in taste and convenience? Review,"Testing the WACACO NANOPRESSO ELEMENTS NEW COLORS has been an eye-opener. I’ve been passionate about coffee for years, and portable espresso machines have always intrigued me. There’s a significant appeal in having coffee-shop quality espresso without relying on a massive machine or electricity. This Arctic Blue model caught my eye, and after weeks of daily use, I feel equipped to share my experience—the good, the bad, and how it stacks up.

**Design and Portability**  
The first thing that stood out to me about this product was its size and aesthetics. It’s compact, measuring just 2.44"" by 2.8"" by 6.14"". Weighing in at a mere 14.4 ounces, it’s delightfully portable—perfect for popping into a backpack or even a glove compartment. The modern metallic finish and Arctic Blue color lend it a sleek, stylish look that beats the usual drab of portable coffee gadgets. The attached protective S-Case, with its durable EVA material and soft fabric interior lining, has been a protective game-changer during my camping trips. However, it’s not just the portability but also the robustness. This thing has survived a couple of accidental drops without a scratch!

**Ease of Use**  
As much as I love coffee, I sometimes dread fiddly setups. This manual operation product requires absolutely no batteries or electricity. Using ground coffee and boiling water, I’ve been able to churn out a shot in under two minutes, though there’s definitely some technique to master regarding the grind and tamp pressure. If you’re a morning zombie like me, rest assured this becomes second nature faster than you'd think. One of my concerns was the manual pumping mechanism, but after getting used to the gentle ""workout"" it gives my hands, I found the process oddly zen.

**Performance and Taste**  
Let’s cut to the chase—does it brew good espresso? For its size and manual nature, the results are downright impressive. With a fine grind and firm tamp, the machine produces thick crema that rivals coffee shop espresso. That first sip, creamy and bold, had me hooked. While it doesn’t reach the level of high-pressure commercial machines (duh, it’s hand-pumped!), it’s leagues ahead of other portable options I’ve tried. My co-worker, a notorious coffee snob, gave it an unexpected thumbs up, which speaks volumes.

**Positives**  
- Truly portable: Takes up minimal space and is very lightweight.  
- Durable: Survived daily use and outdoor adventures, with scratches barely an issue.  
- Impressive crema: Enough to satisfy even picky espresso drinkers.  
- Easy to clean: The reusable filter and parts dismantle seamlessly for quick and thorough cleaning.  

**Operation Challenges**  
Every product has its quirks. If you’re expecting effortless espresso with zero effort, the manual nature may disappoint. The pumping process can demand about 15-20 pumps to create the necessary pressure. My aunt, who has arthritis, struggled while testing it. Additionally, it does take trial and error to perfect the grind and tamp combination. Too fine, and it’s a nightmare to press; too coarse, and the crema suffers.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Pumping requires effort and could be prohibitive for users with physical limitations.  
- Works only with ground coffee unless the NS Adapter is bought (a separate accessory).  
- Slight learning curve for optimizing consistency.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning the machine is a breeze. A quick rinse after use removes most of the residue, and the coffee grounds often pop out as a neat “puck.” For deeper cleaning, all portafilter components come apart easily. Compared to traditional espresso machines or even pod-based ones, the cleanup process here is refreshingly quick and simple. 

**Product Competitors**  
Compared to other portable espresso makers like the Handpresso or AeroPress, the Nanopresso provides a more authentic espresso experience. While the AeroPress has its loyal fans, particularly for versatility in brewing styles, it lacks in generating the rich crema that defines a good espresso. Handpresso makes a case as a comparable product in terms of portability, but I've found it bulkier and less intuitive than this one. In terms of aesthetics, the modern design of this product also trumps others in the same category.

**Smart Spending**  
Given what it offers in portability and performance, its price-to-quality ratio feels justifiable. Sure, there are cheaper manual brewers, but they tend to skimp on build quality or fail to deliver a true espresso experience. For someone who often travels or camps—and refuses to compromise on coffee quality—this product is worth every penny. The additional accessories, like the optional Barista Kit or NS Adapter for capsules, enhance its value and versatility even further. It’s an investment compared to pre-ground coffee fiascos at the office vending machine.
