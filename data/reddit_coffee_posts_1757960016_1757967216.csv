1nhwnu5,https://i.redd.it/z6binu6fydpf1.jpeg,*sighs* I don't know what to title this.,"So, the gist of it is that this morning while I was dating & putting away the pastries, none of us realized the door was still locked shortly after opening. For context, I am not tall and typically when I am on warming, I have to peek beside the pastry case to greet someone. I had the pastry cart next to said case and it had a lot of stuff on it still with a sign on top of said case genuinely obstructing my view. 

This customer basically said to my SSV that the ""person putting away the pastries was staring at me when I tried to open the door."" I was *not* at a counter staring at her as she tried to get in. Like I said, view was obstructed. It was pitch black out and anyone would be kind of hard to see in my field of vision. Or lack thereof, since I was focused on putting pastries away + dating them. I didn't hear her say anything about it when she came through the drive thru, so they probably said it at the window. 

Not that this really excuses anything, but this is more of an explanation. I am neurodivergent and sometimes I am not fully focused. If I look around or something like that, it does not mean I see what's further off into the distance. It is something I am working on. I don't know why the person who posted this decided to lie in the review by saying ""I was at a counter and was staring at them"" because that is sorely untrue.

I am sorry that they had to come through the drive through. I didn't think to remind my newish ssv to unlock the front door. But lying in a review just not on. At all. It was dark out and I did not see this customer at the door. Plain and simple. It did not help that again, I was behind the pastry case and there was a sign ontop of that case that very much obstructed my ability to see the front entrance.

TEXT BLURB:

The worlds gone NUTS!

What do you think about this ?

\---

Hey, I wanted to come on quickly and talk about how I've got 40 days sober today, but something else happened. Which uh. Has really sort of thrown me for a loop.

So.

I don't care about politics. I don't care about politicians. I've never voted. I'm just not interested. I'm an artist. I'm myopic about just...art and creating. That's all I care about, to a fault. I really don't care about anything else apart from my kids.

Um.

But. So. Charlie Kirk was just assassinated. Literally assassinated at a university. And, forget politics. Forget anything to do with politics. Forget anything to do with if you agreed or disagreed with him. I wasn't a massive follower of what he was do...of what he was doing and what he was saying, so I don't know the extend of his beliefs or whatever, but I do know that I met him a couple of times. I was working with a couple of creators from the whatever podcast a couple of years ago. Funnily enough, both female left wing people from that podcast are doing the music thing. It just shows you I don't care about politics. And I met him a couple of times. Cuz he was...I think he was like the main thing in that podcast. Anyway.

We didn't talk about politics, we talked about our kids. He was...29 or 28? Really young guy, had a very young family. Just sweet, charismatic, energetic...I just...over coffee, we just talked about our kids. That's all we talked about. He...a human being who was sweet and nice and just...had...loved his family. That's how...I know him.

So. Firstly to see that he was assassinated is breathtaking. I can't get over it. But. Secondly. There's all these people posting that they're celebrating that he's dead. He's got a young family, got two small daughters. Duno what age they are now, but they were tiny when we were talking back then, maybe 4 or 5, I can't remember. Sorry, I'm having bubblegum.

It's just kind of made me...like he's a human being. It's kind of made me have more resolve to do this human being project that I've been talking about. We're all human. At the end of the day, we're human beings. And if someone gets assassinated, literally I Uh...someone commented that his family was there. To not feel...your heart go out to that family and that man...is not human, it's evil. Cuz like who cares what he thinks about stuff. Who cares if you agree with or disagree with him. It's a fellow human being who's just been kill...shot and killed, with a young family, in the most horrific way imaginable from what I've read.

I just feel like, if I can...somehow start talking about...I've had this idea for a while, this human being project that's about showing the good and bad side of me, y'know. Like. I had a...I wanted to make a p\[roper video about it tomorrow but patreon you're my inner circle so I can tell you in front of everyone else.

Like I'm a good guy, and I'm a bad guy. I've got duality, like I'm...I'm human. I do good things, I do bad things. When I'm high, I do more bad things than good things. When I'm sober, I do more good things than bad things, hopefully. But both sides of that are in me, and I probab...I think they're probably in you too, if you're human. We all make mistakes, we're all just...I was guna say we're doing the best we can but I...sometimes I'm not doing the best I can. Sometimes I'm a dick cuz I wana be a dick. Like...and there's no excuse for it, but it's part of my character, I've got a light side and dark side. And I really wana talk about that. Cuz I feel like on social media people just put out ""I'm a good person."" But that's not true. I see it...these influencers, saying how good they are all the time, and I know they're not good people. I have experience.

But no one ever talks about their faults or their dark side, and who else is guna do it, I'm guna do it, obviously, because I'm an idiot, and I'm too honest. Bit I am guna start talking about my dark side. Cuz I know like a few months ago when I was high, I made a video and I remember it, and I remember thinking that's really interesting, talking about the split personality around...it may have been around sex stuff like...there can be a dark side if the...someone you're with is into dark s...you can't bring out a dark side that you didn't know was there.

Like, trigger warning, but that's....and you know obviously consensual within like...cuz people like to play around with that don't they, I don't know if it's even wise for me even to be saying this but I'm guna cuz I...I wana talk about what it's like to be an authentic human being, the good and bad. And after Charlie's just been assassinated, like literally assassinated by I assume people that didn't agree with him, I think it's all the more important now that we talk about...we're all amazing and fucked up, right? No one knows...I'm different now than I was a year ago. I think different things than I thought two years ago. Some things I think completely differently about. Cuz, I hate this word, it is a work in progress, and you don't just get to one point and then you stop. Like some videos I'd see of myself like I made two years ago make me want to puke. Like. And, y'know, drugs and everything. There's so many different factors involved.

I'm not blaming drugs, I've been an asshole. But. It's not that I get to this point of being an asshole and then stop. It's, we're all constantly evolving, aren't we like if we look back 10 years or 15 years ago. So imagine killing someone because you don't agree with them. That's c...fucking crazy to me.

Yeah.

I wanted to come on to talk about how I'm 40 days sober, but this seemed more important somehow. But I am 40 days sober, it's the first early recovery I've ever had without any medication. I'm not on...I'm not saying this is good for everyone. In many ways, I was really stupid about the way I stopped by the way. I threw every single drug I had, prescribed and non-prescribed, down the toilet, on the last day of last...of...two months of go. July.

Wouldn't advise it, it's a terrible way, can kill you actually. Some of the stuff I was taking, if you stop it can kill you, like Xanax. But. I was taking everything. Anyway, so. I went from that, to being brutally sober for...for...and it was brutal, the first two weeks was horrendous and brutal, and I wouldn't wish that on anyone else. But I'm pretty strong. My my my...family history on my dad's side are very strong...very hearty strong people, Irish, y'know. My dad grew up with no shoes, no electricity, no running water, literally, in southern Ireland. So they're quite hearty people, I think I got a bit of that constitution. I never get ill, or whatever. So I just went through it.

I wouldn't advise it, but. As you've heard me say, week 3 and week 4, I've never felt better. I've never felt better. I feel completely sharp and focused and on a mission with this human project and tying it all into the arc because I found that with soundwork I can bring out the good and bad side of me. Like on my onlyfans, that's the pure bad, that's the pure dark side, and the music is the pure dark side. On this platform and on socials, I'm guna be more...no fuck it, I don't want to be more one way or the other. On this side on my social media, I'm just guna talk about what it's like to have the two sides in me. And I'm guna say ""This is what it's like for me to be human, what's it like for you to be human?""

But I do want that dark side to be able to come out and play, the Mr. Hyde side. I do feel like it's a good platform for that. Cuz I'm not guna hide it...I'm not guna suffocate that, cuz it's not genuine to suffocate that or never let that come out. And I've found I can like...tip the scales one way or the other with music.

Anyway. I'm babbling. I love you, I love you.

Um.

Yeah.

1nhwm03,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1nhwm03/initiating_plans_aita/,Initiating Plans - AITA?,"We've been dating for >2 yrs but agree on not merging lives (no interest in marriage or cohabitation). There are plenty of differences in our lifestyles including I (50F) have a demanding career and 50/50 placement of my school aged kids while his (60M) kids are adults and he is retired. 


Because my schedule is the limiting factor in how often we see each other, he early on defaulted to it being entirely up to me to initiate plans. For his part he rarely declines, but he will not ask to get together. Also relevant, we live 45 min apart so meeting up for a quick coffee or something isn't really practical.


Part of his reason is he seems to have an extremely fragile ego, because he told me he doesn't want to be turned down if he asks me to get together. This is odd to me because my schedule is rarely so busy that I couldn't see him at all, at worst I would say ""Oh sorry I can't that night, but how about a different night?"" That is too damaging to your ego? But ok, why don't you just say/ask a generic ""Hey I'd love to see you this week, do you have any nights free to get together?"" Or (like last night) when I ask if you have any plans this week, rather than just saying ""No I don't"" [which is what he said] say ""No, how about you? Would you like to get together?""


We have had this discussion a million times and every single time he says he is just trying to make it easy on me, I tell him when I want to do something, and he will almost always say yes, so I should know from the fact he says yes that of course he wants to see me. (Side note I've also commented that a ""sure"" ""ok"" ""that would work"" with no emotion feels like he has no enthusiasm for seeing me.)


My point is I have told him over and over again, I want to feel like you want to see me badly enough that you will actually *ask* to see me. Yes it's great that you typically say yes but that starts to feel like you just have nothing better to do so if I ask you say 'sure'. But you don't care enough to ever express ""I miss you. I want to see you. ""


When we are together he acts like he's happy to see me, so from his POV that plus him agreeing to the plans I suggest should be enough for me to feel valued. I will add that he more often drives to me as well.


So DOF what say you? AITA for being upset that he doesn't initiate plans? After 2 yrs of this I'm not sure why I keep saying it, he isn't going to change right? It seems dumb to throw away 2 years over this, yet at the same time I feel like what I am asking of him would take so little effort, what does it say that he isn't willing to even occasionally say ""When can we get together?""

I've been living in a tiny apartment for the past year, and let me tell you, finding appliances that fit in my limited counter space has been quite a challenge. Today, I want to share my experience with finding the perfect hot chocolate maker that doesn't take up too much room.

After trying several options, I finally found a compact hot chocolate maker that's been a game-changer for my cozy winter evenings. You can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker

What I love most about this machine is how it fits perfectly in the corner of my counter, leaving plenty of space for other kitchen essentials. It's about the size of a standard coffee maker but packs so much functionality. The best part? It heats and froths the milk simultaneously, creating that rich, creamy hot chocolate we all crave.

Some features that really stood out to me:
- Space-saving vertical design
- Easy-to-clean removable parts
- Multiple temperature settings
- Can also make other hot beverages

I've tried those bulky machines before, and they were just too much for my small kitchen. This one's different though - it's sleek, efficient, and doesn't look out of place in a modern kitchen setup.

For those who are also dealing with limited counter space but don't want to compromise on their hot chocolate experience, you can find this compact marvel here: https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker

Another thing I appreciate is how quiet it is compared to other machines I've used. My previous hot chocolate maker sounded like a jet engine taking off, which wasn't ideal for late-night cravings in my apartment building.

The maintenance is super straightforward too. Just a quick rinse after use, and you're good to go. No complicated cleaning procedures or hard-to-reach spots. This is especially important when you're working with limited sink space.

I've been using it daily for about three months now, and it's held up great. The build quality is solid, and it feels like it'll last for years. Plus, it's energy-efficient, which is always a bonus when you're trying to keep those utility bills down.

If you're hesitating because of space concerns, don't worry - this machine proves that good things really do come in small packages. It's perfect for apartment dwellers, dorm rooms, or anyone who wants to maximize their counter space while still enjoying quality hot chocolate at home.

[Breville Bambino w/ Batatza Virtuoso+],"I could use some tips for dialing in my setup.  My wife wanted to be able to make some coffee-shop quality coffee at home, so we got the base model Breville Bambino and the Baratza Virtuoso+ after looking at various reviews and recommendations.  We also bought an aftermarket bottomless portafilter.  I usually make the coffee in the morning, so I am trying to learn how to use the tools and machines.

At first, we used the stock portafilter with the dual-walled pressurized basket and it worked decently well with our daily drinking coffee.  I removed the black plastic inside the stock portafilter.  My wife was pleased with the decent shots, but I thought we could do better with fresh-ground coffee.

We already had a scale that measures in grams, so I am using that scale to measure out a consistent 18 grams of beans, then I send those beans through the grinder for a single-serving.  I have been very diligent to heat the steamer and brewing components before brewing and also diligent to purge them immediately after use.  My first attempt at steaming milk went pretty poorly, but I am getting nice results after my 3rd attempt.  I am using the plastic tamper that came with the Breville machine.

For the next 5 attempts at brewing, I used the Virtuoso+ to grind up some older Aldi coffee beans that we had.  Based on the stamping, I think the beans are 6 months old.  It took me 5 tries to get a decent shot with the aftermarket portafilter and basket.  I started on the recommended ""8"" setting, but it was brewing in 12 seconds.  A ""3"" setting made it go for about 32 seconds.  It wasn't the best-tasting, but it tasted way better than the first few shots.  I figured the age of the beans was an issue, but I wanted to use the cheaper beans just to learn.

Today, I went to a local coffee shop and bought the espresso beans that the barista recommended.  According to the bag, it was roasted about 20 days ago and is a medium roast that blends 3 different coffee strains.  Still grinding on a ""3"" setting, I got the best shot of espresso out of the machine I have tasted so far.  It took about 32 seconds again.

I had a few questions from things I had seen online during my research:

1. The ""wdt"" method for reducing channeling, does it really help that much?  It seems that there are simple brush-looking ones and others that have gears.  Is one better than the other?

2. Some folks recommend a ""puck screen"" to help the water flow more evenly.  There was also mention of paper filters on the bottom as well.  Does the puck screen or paper filter help that much?

3. I read about some high-precision baskets from IMS for the Breville 54mm size, but I read that I might have to grind the coffee smaller and I am on ""3"" already, so I am nervous about using one of those because IDK if the Virtuoso+ can grind as fine as would be required.  Do high precision baskets make that much of a difference?

I think I have the basics down decently well, but I'd like to figure out what I should try next to improve the results.  Any advice or things I should look into next would be appreciated.",2,1757966770.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

For the last three years I've been on Vyvanse, the only med, stimulant or otherwise, that has been able to touch my ADHD symptoms. Vyvanse has an additional use to treat binge eating disorder, but let me tell ya it also treats normal-eating order. For three years I've been complaining that food simply doesn't taste good, I constantly forget to eat, and some days it's hard for me to break 1,000 calories ffs. And every doctor has just said ‰πÅ_(„ÉÑ)_„Ñè because I hadn't lost a dangerous amount of weight (nevermind that my body excels at downshifting my metabolism at the slightest hint of starvation) and everyone knows weight is the be-all and end-all of health metrics. /s



ANYWAY a few months ago I started working with a new psychiatric prescriber and 1. they are knowledgeable and 2. they fucking *listen* to me. I complained that the Vyvanse was making me too sweaty to live; they said that sucks, there's no cure for that. I said, are you sure? because I found this one case study on PubMed saying that anticholinergics and 5-HT2A antagonists could help. They said, oh that sounds cool, let me look it up. Which they did ON THE SPOT. I fell in love a little bit in that moment. Then they prescribed me 15mg of mirtazapine at bedtime.


Y'all, when I say my life has been changed I am not exaggerating. Not only is everything I eat tasty again, everything I **think about** *sounds* tasty again. I cannot overemphasize how earth-shatteringly mind-blowingly amazing it is to crave food again. It turns out that desire and anticipation are actually *necessary* for pleasure and satisfaction!! And it makes me sleep like a wee baby for 8 hours straight. I do wake up groggy af but the second the coffee and Vyvanse hit, I feel great. It turns out that eating enough food to nourish your body actually gives you energy???? Who would have thunk. Sure, I did have to buy new pants because my old ones won't button anymore but that is a small, small price to pay for enjoying life again. Don't let anyone fat-scare you into thinking otherwise!!


Obviously I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice and it doesn't affect everyone the same and all that good jazz. But I just really really needed to celebrate this milestone with a community that truly understands how momentous this is!!

1nhwi8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nhwi8q/how_do_you_feel_about_too_much_texting/,How do you feel about too much texting?,"I‚Äôve (30F) been talking to this guy (31M) I met on a dating app for 4 days. The day we started talking (Thursday), he asked if I wanted to go out for a drink the following night (Friday). Normally, I like to wait a few days before agreeing to a date, however, it turns out he and I have some mutual friends. I asked one of the mutual friends about him and they said he was a really nice and super sweet guy. So, I agreed to going out with him Friday night and we honestly had a great time. I even ended up meeting him for coffee the next day (Saturday) because it turns we both were going to be in the same area running errands that day. 

But, over these past 4 days, we‚Äôve been texting a lot. And by a lot, I mean like CONSTANT back and forth sharing stories, getting to know each other, etc etc. for hours on end. It has been genuinely nice to chat and get to know him.

However, I woke up yesterday morning and immediately thought something like ‚ÄúUgh, I have to text this guy about my day, what I‚Äôm doing, etc.‚Äù I don‚Äôt even know why I thought this. I really enjoyed texting him at first but now that I spent a day thinking about it, texting him seems like a chore. I‚Äôve been spacing out my replies today because I‚Äôm busy with work, but once I message him back, he just replies right away with multiple texts.

I‚Äôm just not sure how to feel. Part of me is starting to get a bit overwhelmed with all of this texting, but another part of me is still interested in him and wants to talk to him more. I‚Äôm starting to think maybe I jumped into this too fast. Has anyone else gone through something similar, or have felt the same way? Any advice on how to approach this would be appreciated.

1nhwhrr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nhwhrr,I‚Äôm curious how quickly you noticed changes after beginning cycling!,"I‚Äôm dropping a bunch of stats, just in case there are any curious to see. I am sorry for the wall of text, too. 

TLDR; How quickly did you personally notice health changes in your own body, or cardio/respiratory adaptations that made you a better cycler or a on-paper healthier person? (Healthier HR, BP, weight changes, endurance and lowered activity HR, etc). 



I have been cycling a little over a month, 4-5 times weekly for *usually* 15+ miles. I‚Äôm cycling for my heart health and my mental health, I took a gnarly wreck the first week of June on my MTB, and finally discovered road cycling in August which got my body comfortably moving again while I still heal. I have made a couple lifestyle changes; I‚Äôve cut alcohol Monday-Friday, reduced my caffeine, am still maintaining my 10k daily steps + the cycling. 

I‚Äôm mostly winging it, and seeing how my body feels and setting a ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù understanding for how my body is working with these activities. I find that I spend most of my time in the zone 4+ (166-185 is generally normal the last few weeks) and after certain distances the goal is mostly just to keep it there and not climbing further. I don‚Äôt feel fatigued, albeit a little out of breath or I feel my muscles strained, but my heart just loves to get to 150/160 and never go below it again on the long rides, ha. When I am done with the mid-length rides, my HR drops to 75-100 for the remainder of the evening. On the really strenuous rides, I might be at 90-130 for the rest of the evening until I start to really settle down for sleep/relaxation/recovery. 

In the last couple weeks, though, I have noticed a couple tangible changes that makes me curious to how other people‚Äôs bodies have adapted on a timeline:

1) there is a measurable and also perceivable drop in my non-activity heart rate in the days following hard rides. Today, I‚Äôve been at 50-59, and I‚Äôm standing up drinking coffee in my woodshop. Overall, I have noticed my sleep score improving, my garmin-measured stress levels dropping significantly in the last 5 weeks. Pre-near-daily cycling, my heart would be hovering around the 80-110bpm while working, now it‚Äôs seeming to settle in the 55-85bpm range. 

2) my blood pressure on 8/19 was 143/99. A bit high (I just finally got a dr after switching insurance, no worries) ‚Äî I have been checking it for a while routinely to see if I can health my way into avoiding my genetics and medication. I have been keeping an eye on it as a pre-hypertensive for a decade, and am trying to find my high points in the day and establish where to worry or where to improve. I have noticed that in the last 2 weeks, my bp even at times of having just eaten, drank coffee, walked a little, etc has been dropping significantly to a point of being within normal ranges again. 

3) I‚Äôve lost a few pounds, and also I have reduced in bloating quite a bit. Definitely partly to thank for the massive alcohol reduction, but I do have some FODMAP sensitivities, but I‚Äôm finding that with a really long or hard ride, my body is just responding better to food and its movement in general. 

I‚Äôm curious, what were your earliest body changes that you could track on garmin and looking back was a shifting point for you in terms of your body adapting to the sport/exercise in a health-focused way? How long did it take you to see those initial changes?",1,1757966612.0,Garmin,1,1.0,False

I, like most posters here apparently, am one of those initially shy nerdy types. I prefer to listen rather than talk when first meeting people, but once I get to know someone it can be difficult to stop my yapping. Physically I'm 5'11"".  I was a skinny kid whose metabolism is starting to slow down, so thin-ish frame with a tiny bit of flan here and there. Hair is getting thin, unfortunately, so I've taken to wearing hats. That said I feel like I'm generally attractive in the looks department.
As mentioned above, I'm a nerd. I enjoy video and board games, preferring collaborative ones. My main addiction is Magic, but it's not my whole personality (despite being basically my entire post history for this account). Any board game where I can engage and create memories with friends I can find fun in. I have a collection of older Nintendo games and consoles and a MegaDrive with a few games. I enjoy PC games of most varieties, again preferring games to play with friends, however sports games are generally not my jam.
I enjoy music quite a bit, mostly in the rock genres but can appreciate some of everything. I live for concerts, and always try to snag some merch when I attend one. I also have been collecting vinyls, which I play far less often than I should.
I don't watch much TV, and what few shows I do watch are often anime. When I do watch shows I usually prefer comedies, or other light-hearted shows. Movies in general I haven't been keeping up with since Covid, but enjoy watching at home or in theaters.
I enjoy an evening out just as much as one in, and despite the shyness have a fairly decent social life. I have a close-knit friend group that are always looking to get together for some event, and have two weekly interest groups that I meet up with fairly regularly.
On the financial well-being side, I own a house, though it's more of a duplex style place with a shared wall and yard. Still, an incredibly privileged position for a millennial, made possible through parental assistance for the down payment. I work at OSU and do well enough for myself, even if I'm not taking in the dough.

I'm ideally looking for someone who's within 5 years of me, who's able to communicate their feelings and needs well. Someone who's caring, open minded, and compassionate would be ideal. I'm extremely left leaning, so if you're on the right side of the aisle it's not going to work. Pet lovers and nerds are definitely a plus.

I'm open to messages on here, so feel free to send one if you're interested in us getting to know each other. If we kick it off, I'd love to meet up for coffee or something!",1,1757966555.0,614dating,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm trying to decide between getting a Nespresso OriginalLine machine or a L‚ÄôOR machine, and I‚Äôd love some advice from people who‚Äôve used either (or both).

Here‚Äôs my situation:
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôll be buying the machine in France, but I don‚Äôt actually live there.
	‚Ä¢	There is a Nespresso boutique in my country, which makes repairs and maintenance much easier if I go with Nespresso.
	‚Ä¢	I used to have a Nespresso Essenza, but it no longer works.
	‚Ä¢	L‚ÄôOR uses the bigger capsules, which is tempting since I like the idea of a longer coffee.

Pros I see for Nespresso:
	‚Ä¢	Established network for repairs/maintenance where I live.
	‚Ä¢	Wide capsule selection (both from Nespresso and third-party brands).
	‚Ä¢	Reliable build quality (at least in my experience).

Cons for Nespresso:
	‚Ä¢	Smaller capsule size (compared to L‚ÄôOR).
	‚Ä¢	Sometimes pricier per capsule.

Pros I see for L‚ÄôOR:
	‚Ä¢	Bigger pods ‚Üí larger cup sizes.
	‚Ä¢	Machines are usually cheaper than Nespresso.
	‚Ä¢	L‚ÄôOR capsules are widely available in supermarkets.

Cons for L‚ÄôOR:
	‚Ä¢	No official repair/maintenance network where I live.
	‚Ä¢	Build quality can be hit or miss (from what I‚Äôve read).
	‚Ä¢	Fewer third-party capsule options compared to Nespresso.

Questions:
	1.	Which do you think is the better option overall?
	2.	If you recommend going with an OL Nespresso machine, which model would you suggest (something reliable, not overly complicated)?
3. And if you have any other machine recommendations I should consider, I‚Äôd be happy to hear them

Also sorry for the very long story but I feel crazy.
I (28f) had a friend, J (37m) and we were very close for almost a decade. We met while I was trying to find a DM for my DnD party. He ended up being a great DM. The story was amazing and we played on this setup for 6 years. We all became very close friends during those years.
While in Covid lockdown, he almost lived in my house, not literally but he visited regularly we had coffee and late night conversations. During this time, and after 4 years of friendship already, I started realizing that our views where very different on important matters (to me at least). He was expressing really concerning views on politics, trans people, immigration, police brutality, basically all the red flags. We naturally ended up having arguments every night, with me trying to explain why this type of rhetoric is harmful and false. Every night I felt like I came through to him and every next day the arguments continued. My boyfriend was telling me to just let it go but I concidered him a close friend and I was a little bit blind to where this was going and was trying to ‚Äúsave‚Äù him or something. Looking back, that was stupid, but I was convinced that he was not a bad person, because I have a circle of LGBTQ+ friends and he was always respectful to them when we all met up. He kept getting worse tho as the time past. 
One day he posted an Instagram story that it was straight up hate speech and misinformation about trans people competing to the Olympics. I messaged him, explained why this was not acceptable, provided the official link with the correct information and asked him to take it down, because in my opinion, even one person reading this and believing it without checking the legitimacy of the information would be harmful for the trans community. He denied that it was hate speech, he proclaimed that it was his right to express his opinion as per the ‚Äúfreedom of speech‚Äù principle. We ended up arguing and I told him that if he did not delete the post I would have to report it. He said go ahead, so I did. After a while, his posts were flagged as false news from instagram and after some months his social media accounts were banned. When he found out, he complained to us about it and I said ‚Äúyes, I reported you too, remember?‚Äù He laughed it off and we continued life as normal. In the meantime I moved away, so we didn‚Äôt see each other much anymore. While I was visiting some months later, we had an other argument. I started saying ‚Äúlook we are friends, if you have a problem just let us know..‚Äù. He cut me off and said ‚Äúno we are not. Friend respect each other‚Äôs opinions. Not banning their social‚Äù. I was stunned, as I had no idea that was important to him (when it happened he literally laughed it off). I said that one post report is not enough for an account to be banned and I don‚Äôt even regret it because it was fair and also I warned him. The argument continued and he ended up with him saying that we did not respect him anymore, so he should stop wasting his time with us and he should find ‚Äúa new group of 20somethings‚Äù that will respect him. I left, crying, feeling hurt and stupid, disturbed and angry all at the same time. 
After we stopped talking I learned that he was saying all kind of things about me, trying to make our mutual friends ‚Äúsee how much of a narcissist I am‚Äù that I betrayed him and that I‚Äôm trying to socially exclude him (my friends who ‚Äúexcluded‚Äù him, told me later how glad they were I didn‚Äôt talk to him anymore because they couldn‚Äôt stand him and I was the only reason they even said hello). 
I ended up feeling stupid and trying to understand if he was always like that and I didn‚Äôt see it (I was 20 when we met) or if he lost his mind in the process, because I genuinely remember him not being such a piece of shit.
Anyway, this is just the tip of the iceberg, if you want more information I could update, I just wanted to share, because according to him, ‚Äúhis mom, his best friend, his girlfriend and ChatGPT, told him he is right‚Äù. So am I the asshole?",1,1757966183.0,redditonwiki,1,1.0,False

As I sat up my only though was ""Mai yahan aya kaise ? "", panic started to set in, as I looked around, I was ina forest of some sort, dark woods ahead of me and dark wood behind me, an eerie silence and a mist of wet cold enveloped the roots of the woods. I felt trapped, exhausted, and powerless but at ease, no strength to get out of this trance or dream. Dark figure seemed to loom which made me paranoid but I couldn't help it, I had no strength to escape, it felt that I would forever stay there.
Mustering some courage I started to walk, slowly and dreadfully, I was scared, not of the place but the eeriness it carried, I wanted to get out, but as if an invisible anchor was latched onto my spine.

Around the clearing was a well, ""Pyas....."" I stumbled towards it and looked inside, darkness as if a passageway to another world , I looked around for a bucket or something to pull the child out but couldn't find one, "" Suno..., jao mat..."".

I was startled, a child voice, loomed at me from inside the well, "" Kahan hoh tum, kaun ho...., tum andar kaise pohanchey ? "" I screamed into the well.

"" Mai andara aya nahin, giraya gaya hun.."" the voice squeaked, it must have been a child of barely 8-10, I felt pity and intense hatred for the person who could do such a sinister act.

""Tum mujhe dikh nahin rahe, tumhe nikalne kay liye kuch chahiye..."" As if my eyes could focuss better now I could see the head of a child, it's soft whisky hair, and i could see his eyes, it was a boy, fair skinned and frail looking at me.

""Tum mujhe nikalna kyun chahte hoh, tumne hee toh mujhe giraya hai..."" 
I was taken aback, ""Maine kuch nahin kiya..., as i strained my eyes towards the boys face, his face was extremely familiar... I couldn't focus as my head was confused. I longed for sunlight in this dark part of the woods I looked towards the sky but only saw the grey shroud of clouds enveloping the sky as if a cloak had been drawn on it.

""Mujhe khud nahin pata Mai yahan kaise pohancha hun, mai tumhe kyun giraunga ? .. "" I screamed confused and scared. Unknown to me figures began to form a circle around me, I was concentrating to remember who the child resembled. The childs face was visible as if he was being lifted by an invisible force, but I couldn't remember his face.

""Tumhe Ghar Jana hai ?"" The child asked.
""Han..."" 
""Yehi toh tumhara Ghar hai, yahan sey kahan jaogay ?"" 
""Yeh Mera Ghar nahin hai, mujhe toh pata bhi nahin Mai yahan kaise aya.."" 
A feeling of dread began to set in me, an unknown fear.
""Daro mat"", the child smiled, his smile as if warmed my cold heart.
""Maine tumhe yahan pohanchaya hai ? ""
The child knodded still smiling, "" Han, tumne hee, tumne hee mujhe yahan dala hai, dhakela hai, Mujhe dabaya hai, tumhari wajah sey hee Mai yahan hun, tumne dheere dheere karke mujhtahan dhakela hai"" the child screamed and i backed off the well.

I bumped into someone and turned around, I was surrounded by 10 figures, shadow as if encapsulated, tears began to form in my eyes as I began to feel fear, the fear of death.

"" Mujhe yahan sey nikalogay ? "" Child said.
""Han, but kaise ? "" 
""Apna hath badhao""
I turned around and lent my hand into the well. The child held onto it, it felt as if I had known the child my whole life, he climbed out with no effort.

I could see his face, tears welles in my eyes as I fell to my knees, it was me. It was me when I was a toddler. Wearing those grey shorts and blue shirt with those canvas shoes that I loved. Brown silky hair and pink lips.

"" Tumne hee mujhe yahan dala, hum sub ko"" I turned around, as I saw the figures that shrouded me, they all were me, me in that footbal jersey and kit when i used to play football in mid school, me in the cricket uniform when I scored that hattrick. A younger me when I hosted the school assembly. The elder me when i samg in the school choir. The me that wore a suit and was the division leader in the republic day parade. The me who scored the highest in literature. The me that could paint....

""Hum sub tum hai, aur tum bhi mai hun"" I turned towards the child. The child that was me was in the school uniform of kindergarten"" the child smiled, "" Tumhe pata hai tum us saktey hoh ?"" I was taken aback, looked at the child in tears,"" han tum ud sakte hoh, the child moved forward and placed a hand on my cheek, I felt as if I was light, light as the breeze and I began to levitate, all versions of me began to levitate with me, I was surrounded by me, all version of me were laughing and were happy.

"" Tum darte kyun hoh..."" the child asked as he held my hand and we moved towards the dark clouds
""Mujhe dar hai ki mai, Aisa hee reh jaunga, hamesha yahin reh jaunga.., kuch kar nahin paunga, logon sey peechey reh jaunga, mommy and dad ko kuch nahin dila paunga.

""Tumhe Jo chahe voh kar sakte hoh"" the child and all the versionf of me stopped just before the clouds,as if stopped by a barrier. I levitated towards the clouds and began to feel a sliver of sunlight through them.

I turned around and let out my hand towards the child, the child me merely waves his head refusing to come along.

"" Mai tum hee hun aur tum mai, meri journey khatam ho chuki hai, yeh tumhari hai......"" The childs voice loomed as i floated through the clouds, I felt warmth enveloping me, as i was lifted through them...

I woke up in my bed, drenched in sweat, it was 12 in the noon, sunlight streamed through the window as I was sleeping.

I went out into the sun, holding the cup of coffee, as I looked towards the sky, blue and pure.

I've been working in the same administrative job for the past three years (and trying desperately to get out for two to no avail) and I'm really, genuinely at the end of my rope. I'm coming up on the end of a period of leave and the dread of going back to work is paralysing. 

I have struggled so so much with this job specifically. I managed full-time school with a double major in two incredibly reading/writing heavy fields (that sometimes fell into my special interests, so make of that what you will) and worked 6-12 hours on the weekends at a coffee shop (also my special interest, ngl). Still, I had a decently high GPA. So I am capable of doing the work, and when it came to what I was doing in uni, both the programs and the job, I was *good* at it.

Yet working 9-5 (more like 8-5) is infinitely more fatiguing, even though the work is supposedly easier. I'm mostly doing data entry and fill-in-the-blank letters. I'm just so *bad* at it. I try to triple-check everything multiple times and still got written up for errors and being too slow (because I'm triple-checking for errors). I've been spoken to about not fitting in well with office culture but being around people all the time feels like I'm losing my mind. I contribute when I have things to say, but it's a very individual job. I have to drive as my workplace is not transit-accessible and even though it's shorter by half than my commute to uni I find it so overstimulating to be ""on"" for ten or eleven hours a day. I'm in tears and struggling with headaches and musculoskeletal pain by the time I get home. Even though I supposedly have evenings and weekends to myself I am using all that time to recover, but it's not been enough, and over these last three years I've just gotten more fatigued, more pain, more brain fog; my mind feels like slop from sheer fatigue now. I don't know how I've been functioning, other than letting everything else in my life go to shit. (After I went on annual leave, I slept hard for about five days and then cleaned my place for the first time in two years -- god, what a *relief* that was; I feel *much* happier with a tidy space.)

I have a diagnosis. I've been diagnosed with autism and ADHD since I was twelve (in 2010). I am also high-masking, so my GP does not believe in the diagnosis and has refused to provide documentation for accomodations. I've been fighting the thoughts that I'm just weak or that I'm not trying hard enough to succeed or that I shouldn't feel entitled to special treatment (since I've gone most of my life without accomodations or, in uni, without often using the accomodations I asked for). 

I don't know if it's the type of job or if I'm just not cut out for office jobs in general. I had my eye on doing a program that is more hands-on and useful (in healthcare, but not patient-facing), so I'm currently doing the science prerequisites for that and I'm quite enjoying it so far, even though it is a lot of work as I'm relearning concepts I haven't thought about for years. I'm not sure what *that* says about me -- am I just good at school? Am I always going to find working so difficult? Is it me that's the problem? *Do* I just need to try harder?

I‚Äôm a 25F and I‚Äôve been working in the sales department at PepsiCo for a little over six years. This job has basically been my whole adult life. I started right after college, I‚Äôve never been late, I‚Äôve hit every quota, and I go to every stupid team-building event. I honestly thought I was safe.

Yesterday morning I went to grab coffee in the break room and overheard my boss talking with the CFO. They didn‚Äôt see me. My boss literally said my name and something about ‚Äúnext on the list if we move forward with cuts.‚Äù I froze. I just stood there behind the wall like an idiot until they left.

I know PepsiCo‚Äôs been quietly restructuring and there‚Äôs been talk of a big layoff, so part of me thinks this isn‚Äôt even about my performance, it‚Äôs just numbers. But now I‚Äôm stuck in this horrible limbo. I‚Äôm working extra hours, double-checking every email, basically killing myself to prove my worth, and it‚Äôs exhausting.

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about whether I should talk to my boss. Part of me wants to ask for clarity so I can plan my life if I‚Äôm about to lose my job. But I‚Äôm scared that bringing it up will make things worse or tip him off that I overheard something I ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt‚Äù have.

Any tips regarding this?,"So, for context, in the last two weeks I've only drank coffee twice, both times at noon, and ended up getting a tingling sensation in my body at night time when trying to sleep. 

The first time was last week, the tingling began in my right wrist, then spread to my hand, then my entire arm, then right knee, then my lips, then my left wrist/hand/arm/knee. It ended up getting worse and until I knew it I was in the bathroom barely standing because of how numb my knees were, my heart was pounding like I had just been running away from a cheetah, and I actually thought I was dying. It got better after half an hour. 

The second time is today, aka now, bc I thought the above situation was just a one time thing, however this time I only feel it in my wrists, my right knee, and lips, no pounding heart, no fear of dying, just tingling that hasn't gotten worse (and actually by the time I finished typing all this it had gotten better). 

I've never had this happen before, and this has started happening suspiciously after I got back from vacation with my mom and brother (1 week long) where coffee was a free and optional part of breakfast which I took advantage of, and I feel like this continuous intake of caffeine then a drawback has something to do with this, bc I don't usually drink it daily.

I'm just asking if anyone has ever experienced anything like this and if cutting back on caffeine helped this go away. I'm not looking to quit it entirely bc I never had problems with coffee or other caffeine stuff before, but rather looking to cleanse my body until the risk of this potentially goes away",1,1757965870.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

We had an infinite balcony and it was perfect - we wouldn‚Äôt have been able to enjoy most of the time on a traditional balcony, even in port.  This allowed us plenty of opportunities to see outside from the bed and we got fresh air when we wanted it without having to leave the cabin.

The rooms had plenty of space, storage and were well-appointed.  The chairs at the infinite balcony could have been a bit more comfortable but, overall, they worked out fine.  We took USB-C charging ports and had more than enough room to keep our phones, iPads, watches and portable battery chargers topped off.  We asked our cabin steward to clear out our fridge at the start of the trip (leaving us room to store water bottles, protein shakes, etc) and for two blankets for the king bed.  Thank goodness for the blankets because I‚Äôm from FL and I would have been miserable without the extra layers.

We ate in the MDR, buffets and the Fine Cut specialty restaurant.  MDR service was stellar - absolutely nothing they could do to improve.  The food was okay.  Not awful but nothing memorable - I had salmon, trout, lobster and shrimp.  Nothing wrong with any of the entrees, just nothing to write home about.  The steak at Fine Cut was very salty but I don‚Äôt eat a lot of salt so that was probably just me.  It was a good cut of NY strip and the sides were good.  The Ocean Cafe was (I think) the name of the buffet area and I enjoyed it as much as the MDR.  My husband ate a lot of pizza - I‚Äôd put it up there with a Little Cesar‚Äôs pizza - while I searched out salads and pasta/veggie dishes.  The croissants were excellent, the bacon was ungodly salty (that wasn‚Äôt just me - heard it from lots of people), the eggs were runny (not my preference but if you like your eggs wet, you‚Äôd have been happy) and the waffle was great.  Cafe il Baccio made great lattes so that was usually the bulk of my breakfast unless we ordered continental breakfast with room service (coffee and muffins).  

Service, throughout the ship, was impeccable at all times.  Embarking was simple and efficient, probably took less than 30 mins from start to finish, then we dropped our carry on luggage in the stateroom and headed out to explore.  Disembarking for ports and on the final day was smooth, though it took a little bit longer and if you take the airport transfers arranged/booked through Celebrity, you‚Äôre going to be in a massive queue so be forewarned.  We booked with an outside company and they were waiting for us when we exited.

The excursions we did through Celebrity, as well as one with Viator, were spectacular and I couldn‚Äôt have asked for more.  There really wasn‚Äôt enough time in each port if you did an excursion that lasted more than 2 hours so I felt bad for our travel partners, as this was their first trip.  

Ketchikan:  Viator trip via hovercraft was 1:45 and this was one of the most interesting excursions I‚Äôve had.  First, it‚Äôs a hovercraft so of course it was interesting, but the guides took us to known bald eagle nesting sites and fed the pair fish so we could get a somewhat close up look.  Next we went to a cove and spent about 25 mins walking around (I found sea glass and some neat shells - would have loved to have spent longer there).  Ketchikan is still the most commercialized port we stopped at and it felt a little like Cherokee, NC, if you‚Äôve ever been there.

Juneau:  Through Celebrity, this Seaplane, Packraft and Glacier Trek was a bucket list item.  The seaplane landing and takeoff were incredibly smooth and the scenery was stunning.  Once we landed we geared up in waterproof (almost) pants, jacket, pad, gloves and boots and got in packraft kayaks for a short (maybe 10 mins) paddle to Norris Glacier and took a guided tour after donning crampons and hiking poles.  The guides were very friendly, answered every question and made sure we had an enjoyable trip.  

Skagway:  Also through Celebrity, the Whitepass Railway and Yukon Suspension Bridge.  The Suspension Bridge is in Yukon Territory so your passport is required, coming and going.  The views are incredible, the bison chili and hot chocolate were outstanding and they had quite a nice little gift shop.  The Railway was only ‚Äúmeh‚Äù.  The scenery was beautiful, but the people in our car were constantly going from the front to the back to take photos, standing in the aisles and when they‚Äôd go out on the little observation deck between cars, they left the door open every single time like they were raised in barns.  Unless you were willing to be as rude as them, you couldn‚Äôt see half of the views because they were in the way.  The bridge was worth the entire excursion but the lack of manners left something to be desired.

Victoria:  We skipped it and used the time to pack.  Weren‚Äôt impressed the first time around (shops closed at 6pm on a Saturday and we encountered local thugs having a street fight and felt the place was sketchy) so we weren‚Äôt interested in returning.

1nhvwgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LondonTravel/comments/1nhvwgd/trip_report_during_tube_strikes/,Trip Report During Tube Strikes,"Hi everyone!  
We just spent six days in London and had a wonderful time. Here‚Äôs an outline of what we did.

We arrived on Saturday, September 6th. Our plane landed around 7:30 a.m. London time, and we had absolutely no issues getting through security. We followed the signs to the Elizabeth line, tapped in for the first time, and rode it down to Farringdon. From there it was about a 15-minute walk to our hotel in Blackfriars. We arrived around 9:30, which left us with about 90 minutes to kill before we could check in (we had paid for early check-in at 11).

We stayed at the Premier Inn. It wasn‚Äôt glamorous by any means, but the location was great, the room was clean, and the bed was comfortable. The only issue was the A/C shutting off in the middle of the night, which meant waking up in a pool of sweat almost every night. The duvet was extremely thick, and reception said they didn‚Äôt have other blankets. Still, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay here again‚Äîor at another Premier Inn.

Saturday was a loose day for us, mostly just getting our feet wet. We had expected security and transit into the city to take longer, so getting in as early as we did was surprising. After dropping our bags and taking a quick shower, we headed out and ended up at the Tate Modern. It was on our ‚Äúif we have time‚Äù list, but we didn‚Äôt realize how close it was to our hotel, about a 20-minute walk. From there we wandered over to Covent Garden for dinner.

After dinner, jet lag finally caught up to us. Between the overnight flight and walking around all day, we crashed hard and were asleep by 8 p.m. Next time I think I‚Äôd prefer landing in the afternoon, grabbing dinner, and heading to bed early. Having a full day right away, combined with the jet lag, made a lot of it blur together.

Sunday we did [this walking tour.](https://secretldn.com/sightseeing-london-map-walking-route/) This was one of the trip highlights, being able to see all of this in one efficient swoop was hard to beat. We rode the London Eye (cool, but not worth the ticket price in my opinion, better views to come later) and toured the Tower of London (definitely recommend). The bookstalls under Waterloo are worth a stop, and we stumbled across an outdoor food hall that was hosting a craft market. It was a great spot. We ended the night pub-hopping.

Monday was museum day. We started at the British Museum, then had afternoon tea at the Great Court Restaurant, which was excellent. After that we visited the National Gallery. Both places being free absolutely blew my mind, they‚Äôre worth visiting a hundred times over, and the fact that they cost nothing is  the cherry on top. We ended Monday with dinner in Chinatown.

Tuesday was a mix of shopping and parks. We started at Hyde Park, wandered through Kensington (the Albert Memorial is stunning), and then made our way to Notting Hill. I stopped at Lucky Time, a great vintage watch shop for fellow watch fans, and we explored Portobello Road down to Golborne Road. From there we headed to Camden Market, then walked up to Primrose Hill and through Regent‚Äôs Park and the Queen‚Äôs Rose Garden. We ended the day at more pubs.

Camden is an interesting area. It wasn‚Äôt dirty, but it had more litter than anywhere else we saw. Very different vibe from the rest of London.

Primrose Hill, on the other hand, is an absolute must. The view of the skyline from the top is incredible.

Wednesday we took a day trip to Canterbury and Whitstable. From Blackfriars we rode the Thameslink to St. Pancras, then transferred to the Southeastern Line to Canterbury West. We arrived around 9:30 a.m. and went straight to the cathedral, which was beautiful. After that we did a punting tour, grabbed lunch, and caught a Stagecoach bus to Whitstable. There we walked the coast, explored a bit, and had a delicious platter of oysters before returning to Canterbury. We shopped around until our train back at 8:30, arriving at the hotel by 10.

To be honest, we were underwhelmed by both Canterbury and Whitstable. Canterbury was pretty but felt dead, and Whitstable seemed like almost everything was closed. A local couple mentioned that university doesn‚Äôt start until October, so maybe we just went in the off-season.

Thursday we had lunch at Borough Market and a few treats. I‚Äôd read it was touristy, but we thought it was awesome the food was great, and the vendors were friendly. We wandered some more, looped back by Big Ben, and wrapped up the trip at the Sky Garden.

Dinner at The Larch gave us access, and I have to say, The Larch was fantastic probably the best meal I had in London (the prawn gnocchi). But the Sky Garden itself is the one thing I‚Äôd recommend to absolutely anyone visiting. The fact that it‚Äôs free is wild. The views are stunning, the building is beautiful, and watching the sunset give way to city lights with a drink in hand was unforgettable.

Friday was just coffee, one last walk, and then off to Heathrow.

A few extra thoughts:

* The tube strikes were a real pain in the ass. We planned to walk a lot anyway, but the strikes meant even more walking and made us less inclined to venture out, we had planned to visit Greenwich or Islington but it didn't seem worth it with the uncertainty of everything. Buses were overwhelmed, and sometimes it was faster to walk than wait. The Elizabeth line and rail worked when they made sense, but they were packed too. Strikes aren‚Äôt a reason to cancel a trip, but they do impact it. We averaged 30k steps a day on the bright side, we got to see more of the city.
* Tap-to-pay everywhere is amazing. I never pulled out my physical credit card once.
* London is incredibly clean. Outside of Camden, we hardly saw litter at all, which is impressive for a city of nine million.
* People mostly kept to themselves, though we did chat with a few shop owners and shared a table with a lovely couple from Liverpool.
* Food was solid overall. We ate everything from sushi to Italian to pub fare. Other than The Larch, nothing stood out as exceptional, but nothing disappointed either.
* Pastries were everywhere, and we ate a ton of them. Not a single bad coffee. Same with pubs, not a single bad pint, and ducking into one during a rain shower was perfect.
* The weather was great, though the advice about layers is spot-on. Temperatures swung wildly, sometimes 10 degrees in 10 minutes. We got rained on in Canterbury and caught two quick downpours Thursday, but otherwise it was perfect.

All in all, we had a wonderful time. We spent about $4,400 total (flights were booked with points), with the hotel being the biggest chunk at $1,400.

Here‚Äôs a rough breakdown:

* Flights: $280 after points
* Hotel: $1,400
* Dog boarding: $300
* Canterbury trains: $130
* Local transit: $120
* Whitstable bus: \~$20
* Watch: $230
* Souvenirs/gifts: \~$400
* London Eye: $145
* Tower of London: $100
* Canterbury Cathedral: $55
* Punting tour: \~$70
* Food/coffee/pubs: around $1,000
* Misc: $20‚Äì30 on cold medicine, cough drops, tissues; a few public toilet fees; bottled water from Tesco; and a regrettable $30 Subway in Houston during our layover.

I will say that you can probably go for much cheaper than we did, stay at hostel instead of hotel. Have a sandwich instead of going to a restaurant, cheaper souvenirs and you don't need to pay for the Eye of London or Tower of London to enjoy yourself, there is plenty of free things to do.

1nhvstm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mirena/comments/1nhvstm/8_months_post_removal/,8 months post removal,"About a year ago I started considering removing my IUD that I‚Äôve had for 8 years. 
(First one lasted 5 years to expire, second one in for 3)
I‚Äôm 27, first one was put in at 19 after having nothing but weight gain and acne on the BC pills. 

Negative Symptoms before removal: 

1) the worst personal symptom. 
I always felt distracted or disconnect. From about 3 months into my first IUD I started losing focus. Conversations were harder to hold. Studying in school was DIFFICULT. Not to mention the lack of desire to study and do school work outside of school. Felt like I couldn‚Äôt lock in on a mental task. 
I chalked it up to ‚Äúschool is hard. I‚Äôll get through this. It‚Äôs supposed to be like this‚Äù. 
But even friends started noticing after a year I wasn‚Äôt socially there when we were out and conversing. My BF said I became ‚Äúditzy‚Äù which was not like me. 
I loved reading and actually quit reading books entirely by the time I was about 22 because I couldn‚Äôt focus into them anymore. 

2)
Health was fine. But lost a little appetite. Started eating less. Thought it was stress from school. I even started eating sushi less. I‚Äôm obsessed with sushi. Weight went down from 140lbs to 132 lbs and I‚Äôve stayed there since. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and tone with decent muscle. Muscle mass was lost a little bit despite never changing my gym routine. 
I have a great diet. Very Whole Foods orientated. 

3) 
The sex drive. Personally the worst symptom for my marriage IMO. 
My libido didn‚Äôt decrease. But my partners did. Fell off after a year. 
Been with my BF since we were 16 highschool sweethearts. IUD at 19. 
Sex had always been amazing for the first 3 years. Zero complaints. Until I had the mirena about a year. My bf is fit, natural healthy, he was also 19 at the time. After 3 years of amazing sex, it started to fade. We thought it was the three year burn out? But we were so young. All my other friends at 19 couldn‚Äôt stop humping. We felt like we had a personal problem somehow. The drive was still there, desire, want, attraction, ect. But the performance was not. He wasn‚Äôt getting as erect. I would go oral, he would be erect, but then he‚Äôd lose it once inside me after 5-10 minutes. Not like him. 
He started saying my vagina felt different. Less wet, not as soft and pleasing, he could also feel my IUD in some positions. We checked with doctor, mirena was still in position and hadn‚Äôt shifted. They shortened the cords. All was fine with me. BF got on testosterone consistently despite his T levels being good. He then started working out 3-4 times a week and took T once a week. Sex came back for about 6 months (I think due to his work out & Testosterone injections) and then same result. He had a lack of erection stiffness, loss of erections during the act. It even got to the point his penis seemed to be shrinking in size. It no longer just got hard like it used to, and also when he was flaccid it no longer hung like it used to. We chalked this up as ‚Äúis this just natural aging?‚Äù But my libido never left or dropped. Libido was very high between us prior to age 20/21. 

***The decision to remove***
Age 25 rolls in. We start thinking about having a family. Life‚Äôs good, jobs good, household is good except no children. Sex is still lack luster but we have managed with toys & other alternatives. 
So after a year we decide to remove it, we are ready for kids at 26 years old. 
Removal was easy. Thought about self removal because my focus and brain fog was pretty dramatic. Went back & forth for a year because of frustration with my brain fog and seeing so many positive TikTok‚Äôs about women removing and self removing mirena. (I traveled for work as a flight attendant during this time for a while so doctors visits with my local OB weren‚Äôt easy.) finally get it removed at 26 yo. 


The POSITIVE results after removal: 

1) 
I did not have a crash after removal. Like I said our diets are whole food diets. We are healthy. I think our health, diet and natural supplements helped avoid a crash. For about a week I‚Äôd get a headache. 
Tylenol would handle that and I pushed through work. 
But a very pain free removal. And easy week of recovery of just small headaches. Worried about a crash that never came. 
My period returned after day 40. 
First one was heavy. Lots of dark red. Heavy for 3 days. Light on day 4. Cramps in the beginning. 
Since then my cycle is on point, same time every month. Zero to light cramping. Light first day, heavy second day, light on day three, and spotting/finishing on day four. I had always had easy periods. I think diet has a lot to do with this. My meals consist of mostly meat with occasional vegetables. And fruit or nuts for snack during the day. No sodas. No alcohol. 
I also don‚Äôt use cotton tampons or pads. I use period underwear and free bleed when at home. Honestly the blood only comes out when I sit on the toilet. IMO cotton should not be inserted into the vagina.

2) 
I gained weight. My muscle tone came back. I jumped up from 130 lbs to 142 lbs again in two months!! My body looks more full, feminine, and healthy. My skin changed. It carried a tan glow better, it looked deeper and healthier. I didn‚Äôt notice a negative change in my skin when I was on it because it happened over time. But once I got off, I gained a youthfulness glow back. 

3) 
The best positive IMO. 
Brain fog/Brain noise= gone. 
Almost immediately my brain fog was gone. After the week of headaches I noticed my focus was better and slowly coming back. 
After two months I was like ‚Äúexcuse me, wow this is me? Is this me??? This was normal???!!!!‚Äù
Everything I thought was stress from work or school causing my mental static wasn‚Äôt the cause. I finished school but still always felt foggy at work, conversations, ect. Even taking supplements, caffeine, coffee all day, I couldn‚Äôt hone in mentally. That was all gone. I feel like I have ME again. I‚Äôm focused. Engaged. Conversations carry better and longer. And I READ AGAIN!! I picked up a book and got almost 1/3 through it in a night without any mental distraction. 
I don‚Äôt know how to describe it other than it feels like a cap of brain fog was lifted.  

4) 
The sex is back, in full swing. This was the best positive outcome for my marriage. 
Like I said, MY libido never dropped. My now husband was affected. We never thought my IUD could be a problem to HIM until a friend suggested it. He tried testosterone, over the counter gas station erection pills, pumps, creams, prescription ED meds, sildenafil. 
Sildenafil gave us a decent sex life back. 
But overall we noticed once he was in me vaginally he would lose erection after 5-10 minutes without his sexual  completion. 
Regardless of the pill he was taking. 
After JUST TWO MONTHS of having the mirena removed he said I felt better internally. He said my vagina felt softer, more wet, and more pleasing internally. Sex started lasting longer. He no longer was losing erections. He quit taking ED meds. His normal erections came back. His sperm seems more in abundance when he finishes. The amount of sperm literally doubled. The shrinkage we observed, it‚Äôs gone. It‚Äôs almost like he gained size back in length and girth when flaccid. But the best feeling was him finally getting to completion without losing an erection inside of me. 
I actually cried after that because I felt I was the problem to his sexual desire for the longest time. I felt he wasn‚Äôt attracted to me. I had so many internal self doubts I never voiced because I knew he loved me and every bit of me. And any doubts all just vanished after that moment. 
It felt ‚Äúmarriage saving‚Äù even though our marriage wasn‚Äôt in trouble ever. 


The conclusion:
I can‚Äôt believe the IUD could‚Äôve had so many negative reactions looking back. All the side effects. Things I ignored and didn‚Äôt think to point the blame on the non-natural hormonal device inside of me. 
My life is 100% better after removal. I wish I would‚Äôve done it sooner, or better yet never had gotten a mirena. 

The beautiful news:
In under a year of trying for a baby, we are now 3 months pregnant. 
Life is good. 

If you‚Äôre considering removing it, do it. 
Supplement with zinc, vitamin C & D, lysine, arginine, and eat healthy to avoid any crash. 
Live good. 

Thank you to all the other ladies who have posted about their removal. You helped guide me to one of my best decisions ever. ",2,1757965091.0,Mirena,0,1.0,False

It was New York City circa 1996. So 29 years ago...



In the video, you see people, some of which who appeared young, some appeared elderly. It was just a real cross-section of people walking around. It was nothing sensationalistic. It was just ordinary people walking around New York City, shopping, going to coffee shops, living life, doing ordinary things.



And a song was playing that had a nostalgic vibe. It was real bittersweet. It was real haunting because it reminded me of spending time with people in New York City just five, six short years ago. And it reminded me of my when my mother and father were young. It was a time that no longer exists. It's a time that's long gone. And interestingly enough, the video even made me cry because I miss when my parents were young. I miss spending time with these friends in New York City. It's sad things change. Maybe I'm nostalgic for the past. It's sad people get older. It's sad people pass away.



And the video wasn't like a big sensationalistic performance like my social media content typically is. It was just ordinary people just walking around, shopping in ordinary clothes. It wasn't like a grandiose pop star wearing ridiculous outfits, behaving sensationalistically, larger than life. It was just people going to work, going about their days, shopping, and having a fun time in Central Park.



So many people live ordinary, boring, maybe not boring - some of it's fun, but so many people live ordinary existences. I think that's not really captured so much on social media, in movies, in TV, just the mundane walking around New York City with your mother, or father, or friends.",1,1757965013.0,AndrewKoloski,0,1.0,False

ill will also separate stress anxiety and panic as three different subjects so u can understand i experience these things and u can apply this thinking to all of these struggles.

so just a little so u know where my thought process at. weakness tiredness sickness anything that would point an arrow to vulnerability was a huge trigger for me which meant i could never relax and never recover.

my pride did cave in and i got professional help. now i guess most of u that really have a hard time with this have heard just accept your feelings. let it happen etc. this is some of what my therapist said as well.

and sure ill sit in it. i learned to make space between what i thought and what i felt. and i could sit for hours with anxiety attacks that lasted forever just draining me or 3-5+ full blown panic attack per day.

sure my mental state was maybe a little better but i couldnt change being stuck in fight or flight 24/7

now theres so much complexity to this topic but ill will try to word what helped me. anyways i refuse to accept and i wanted my conscious and subconscious to shake hands



now take your time on each thing and think deeply of what im saying. u could also write your thoughts down as it helps putting feelings into the part of the brain that deals with logic



first i want you to think of a cold cloth on a body part like your leg, most of u will simulate the feeling since its stored in muscle memory or the subconscious. anyways be very aware of what happens when u do this.

this is directly non verbal communication between your conscious and your subconscious. u thinking a thought and u feeling that thought. now we also need to understand that fight or flight is a survival mechanism,

and your alarm is broken, your subconscious helps u a little too much too fast. but do not think badly about this do not bring emotions to judge. the more you regulate emotions with negative emotions the deeper the muscle memory.

now u need to see this objectively the physical reality. lets say health anxiety. u are hyper focused so every little thing happening in your body will be noticed, thats by design. now the discovery of a new sensation gets u stressed

ur heart start racing. your brain aka your thought see no danger we are not moving our body to feel this kind of pulse. now lets go back to the idea of thinking about a cold cloth, you are thinking a thought feeling the thought.

now back to health anxiety u feel new sensation or unusual or what u perceive as not normal. u think shit is this it? now u guessed it u feel shit is this it. now we can intellectually see the connections. they are communicating non verbal. and u cant catch this unless u are very aware of yourself. and u say i cant control it. yes and no u cant force control, but u can naturally gain control with honesty and experience. so your brain notice something is off, let it search its part of surviving! now u got to be honest with yourself, have u experienced this how many times? and does it escalate? now this is for ppl that have experience with it like they know that its a mental issue.

now for me i could see and think that there was no threat but i couldnt regulate the feeling of fear,. now this is also very important. when your mind comes to the conclusion that threat over. your body is not gonna self regulate in an instance. your heart rates not gonna drop from running pace to chilling pace and your feeling of fear not gonna dissolve into joy. your body have most likely activated hormones or adrenaline that need to get out of the system.

now back to the non verbal communication of feeling the cold cloth. so u most likely have a feeling of temperature right now, so lets say its room temp u gonna try to simulate the feeling of a cold cloth, and i repeat see the unity in thought and feeling and how they communicate with each other. now visualize a line on the right extreme it the feeling of the cold and in the middle its the feeling of room temp and on the left its hot.

u know how every part of this line feels to some extent since its stored in your subconscious.

play With simulating how it feel goin back and forth on the line.

now i want to picture fear/panic on the right side of the line insecure in the middle and calm on the left.

if you truly honest with yourself u know how this feels, though it can be hard to remember the feeling of calm if you scared. and this works absolutely best when ur not yet in it. so u can understand this fully or at least easier

now we need to understand that we cannot feel what u have not experienced, when in fight or flight your thought try to see or predict danger, your subconscious try to feel what it will be like, try to predict the feeling.

now since thats an absolute impossible thing most ppl get stuck in their feelings so since the subconscious the feeling cant see and think analytic the same way your mind does. the mind need to communicate this to your body.

in human history for the most part dangers have been physical and we dealt with it physical, if we could fight it we ran (physical activity) and since all of this for 99.9% is in the mind theres no way we get the feeling of disarming the problem. since its all in the mind, and over time your subconscious gonna be confused.

now back to my line panic on right insecure middle and calm on the left. what most ppl do is regulate feeling with feelings so u sad - feel weak you get pissed and try to make one of em so big it kicks out the other.

so for me i had a really bad habit of getting angry since my head said no danger but my body felt like dying, so i burn all my anger then ill get sad, then i feel natural and then i feel fear again draining.

so do not regulate emotions with other emotions. so back to my line again. our brain notice something unusual, we feel panic build up, now with practice you can extend the window so u get slower toward panic so u get the time to think.

anyhow let your brain look ok ah it felt like my heart skipped a beat, am i holding my breath am i tense have i just chugged way too much coffee, ah its a natural thing ok maybe i shouldnt drink so much coffee or maybe it wasnt even the heart, we who have so much stress are usually very tense maybe it was just a little muscle cramp, oh i experience this everyday. now body will still be scared heart might still race.

but u know this feeling u got the stats, u see the pattern. ok now we need to go into the body, with the same non verbal language that u used when feeling a cold cloth. u first gonna lean into the feeling of fear. this is a feeling u have had many times, feeling of fear today doesnt feel anything different than the fear yesterday it can only be as extreme. now we gonna take that feeling and literally guide it down the line towards calm, so a tool for me is to try to remember the feeling of yawning, thats the best way i can describe as calm. so u can just gently try to yawn when u have found balance in fear.

and finding balance in fear is letting your mind and feeling agree that this is the feeling of fear. u might jojo between feeling ok and not, and thats fine and natural. u also might force it first time that doesnt work doing yawning motion with your face without feeling the yawn just make u look dumb ;) jk and when u are able to make sense in your head and make the non verbal communication with your subconscious happen. you will feel like your feeling and your thoughts handshake so hard and you be ahaa. and the more handshakes u make the stronger your mental health gonna be. now if u have any questions pls dm me, and pls if u can seek professional help, it might expose u to the right word the right thought

at the right time, and this can come from u or this can come from the one helping u.",1,1757964855.0,u_leravdauden,0,1.0,False

At it's absolute worst - my total cholesterol was at 320, triglycerides 159, HDL 50, LDLC 239, VLDLC 32, non-HDL 270. So everything but HDL and VLDLC was outside of the recommended range.

I had zero side effects, and when retesting after 4 months total cholesterol fell to 200, triglycerides went up to 179, LDLC fell to 126, non-HDL fell to 161. So now, HDL was 1 point under the accepted range, but total cholesterol and LDL was in a safer zone. Triglycerides did fall again to 155 2 months later, 5 points above the recommended range. 

I had a CAC test just to be sure, and the score was zero. 

**My question is this: I'm a month into keto again, wondering if this high saturated fat diet is okay given the fact that 1) I will lose significant body fat and 2) The statin I am taking will keep cholesterol down.** 

My diet is of course meat heavy, but lots of olive oil, mixed greens, mixed nuts and chicken breast. Macronutrients and micronutrients are carefully tracked. 

**This is my attempt at justifying it and not sure if it sounds legitimate:** Weight loss is important, and with the statin going and the temporary nature of keto, a short term spike in cholesterol will be okay and be outweighed by the long term benefits of having lost weight. I have tried and failed with traditional calorie reduction without strict guidelines because it's too easy to cheat. Knowing that eating any carbs would kick me out of ketosis has made discipline and calorie tracking very easy for me, and the weight is falling off. I am also exercising a bit more (walks with the kids, bike rides, etc.) because I'm more and more motivated as I see the weight loss. I understand keto won't last forever, and a return to my old habits would mean going right back to where I am, but I'd rather be a healthy weight facing the problem of maintaining it than overweight struggling to do anything about it. 

So yes, it feels weird putting a tablespoon of butter in my morning coffee each day after having a CAC test and being on a statin... but is my logic sound?

Things changhed when I discovered specialty coffee, and while my first approach to good coffee had been inside coffee shops with V60 the real spark came with a couple of espresso, expensive competition lot pulled from La Marzocco Strada.

I started brewing coffe at home with Aeropress with mixed results, then I moved onto espresso: Lagom Casa + Flair 58+. I wanted maximum control and highest possible ceiling so I could explore the vast world of coffee flavour and consisntely achieve great coffee every day.

After almost a year of espresso making, I arrived to the conclusion that this endevour mostly failed.

I got a lot of ""good"" coffee along the way, sometimes even more than good, few mistakes, but I never had the feeling that I was digging below the surface.

At first I looked at the espresso machine: I believe the Flair 58 promise of ""control"" is mostly a scam, I'd say like driving a car while being blindfolded. Almost every shot runs and taste different than the previous one and you can never be sure what has changed. You don't know what temperature you're at, operating the lever mechanism feels ""clanky"" and I can never be consistend with applying pressure.

I was thinking about switching to Odyssey Argos in spring lever configuration, that would take care of some consistency issues but I've also read that you have still to think about properly purging air otherwise you can get inconsisntet output volume and I don't want to start all over again.

I'm thinking of dialing everything down and just find a quicker more streamlined way to get a good cup of coffee without all the fuss and variables.

I don't need any specific equipment suggestion, I just wanted to know if somebody arrived at a similar conclusion and what path was taken moving forward.",2,1757964357.0,espresso,7,0.75,False

1nhvg4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crunchymom/comments/1nhvg4u/correcting_iron_deficiency_anemia_in_3rd/,Correcting Iron Deficiency Anemia in 3rd Trimester without infusion (self experiment success story!),"I just need to put this out there in case someone needs it, like I did 5 weeks ago. 

TLDR: I began pregnancy with good ferritin and hemoglobin. Second trimester did a doozy on me and I became anemic and ""iron deficient"". I was able to get rid of the iron deficiency anemia diagnosis in just 5 weeks- DURING 3rd trimester, even with the increasing iron and blood volume demands! I used AI to research and create a protocol that I was comfortable with because I did not like the advice given by my midwives or naturopath and wanted to avoid harsh supplimentation and iron infusion. Planning a home birth. 



I began my pregnancy with a ferritin of 144 and a hemoglobin of 126 (or 12.6, I'm Canadian) -measured at 8 weeks pregnant. I consider these to be great numbers, as did my midwives and naturopaths. I attributed my good numbers to beef organ supplimentation and a GAPS/WAPF diet prior to conception. I made the mistake of thinking this meant I could relax on supplimentation, and didnt consistently keep up with my iron sources. In second trimester, my blissful, non symptomatic pregnancy experience took a turn. Psyciatric symtoms returned that have been in remission for a few years. My mood, sleep, skin, appetite, energy, was all messed up, rather suddenly! I became an almost daily coffee drinker, when I was more of a once-weekly coffee drinker prior. I thought I needed the coffee to get my energy up, but in reality it was depleting my iron even further. I had ferritin and hemoglobin tested at week 28, and my ferrin had dropped to 26 (from 144!) and hemoglobin was down to 114 (from 126). I was labled ""iron deficient anemic"" by my midwives, and they stressed I begin a high dose of ferrous fumerate (a non-heme iron salt suppliment with low bioavailability and digestive side effects). I knew better.

Blood volume increases and iron demand are  very high in second trimester! I learned it is physiologically normal to have a ferritin decrease of about 70-80% during pregnancy due to these demands. Additionally, I need to note that when my ferritin was tested at the beggining of pregnancy and showed 144, I was fighting a 2 week long cold. Ferritin raises with inflamation, so I believe my initial number was artificially elevated, meaning I was sitting around 100-120 in reality. So, I made a physiologic 80% drop in ferritin but this was too fast and extreme for my body. I needed to feel better, and get my stores up for delivery!

I did not want to take the iron suppliment given by my midwives based on past experience and research. I saw a naturopath and she insisted there was no chance my numbers would raise. Even with supplimenting, I would only decrease because of the demands of the pregnancy. She offered me a lower dose, iron biglycinate suppliment with cofactors, and said ""do whatever you want, you are going to need an infusion in 6 weeks anyway!"" I did not even want to take her suppliment, but I felt desperate as I am planning an out of hospital birth, and my anemic status had ""risked me out."" I wanted to avoid an infusion offered by my naturopath, because injecting high doses of anything and forcing thd body to process it always has its drawbacks. With iron infusion, one of the drawbacks is rapid depletion of phosphate, B vitamins, and electrolyte imbalances. I did not want to mess with that so close to delivery (iron infusions were suggested feom 36-40 weeks). My biggest concerns with oral iron supplimentation was synthetic ingredients and digestive disruption like abdominal pain and constipation. 

After some research, planning, and arguing with AI: 

-I took the naturopaths suppliment 1x daily (Metagenics Hemagenics 29mg iron biglycinate) first thing AM, but 10 minutes after a CamuCamu adrenal cocktail. Followed by breakfast with beef organ capsules. 
-One AOR lactoferrin capsule 2 hours after breakfast.
-Megafood Blood builder (26mg mineral bound iron) 3-4 hours after breakfast, followed by lunch and beef organ capsules.
-2 hours after lunch, another AOR Lactoferrin. 

-I ate all the iron heavy protiens for breakfast and lunch, and NO dairy products until dinner. I did not have a single cup of coffee or tea, and kept my large doses of magnesium away from iron intake. I was very restful, not pushing myself to excersise or exhert myself. I did this for 5 weeks before testing again. I did not experience constipation with this protocol, as long as I kept up my magnesium biglycinate supplimemtation and water!


MY SUCCESS: 
I felt remarkably better after a few weeks of trying this, but I got blood work after 5 weeks My ferritin went from 26 to 47, and hemoglobin from 114 (11.4) to 127 (12.7). This puts me back into the ""safe zone"" for delivery, lowers my risk of hemhorrage, and I am no longer considered iron deficient or anemic! I am going to continue taking my protocol in hopes to not lose any ground and potentially still increase my stores. This worked SO WELL considering my body is still increasing blood volume and baby has lots of iron demands. I probably could have taken more iron, but I did not want to push myself to the point of digestive upset.

Overall, I think my body put my iron stores to good use for growing my baby and did exactly what it needed to! With this stratigic support, I feel almost 100% back to normal. 

Why did this work? 
-vitamin C blocks hemecidin, and allows iron to be absorbed 
-the non-heme iron suppliments had cofactors like copper, and were more bioavailable. I also took beef organs which are highly bioavailable and have cofactors (bovine spleen is best!)
- lactoferrin taken 2 hours after iron sources binds to the leftover iron in the gut and gives it a second chance to be absorbed. Lactoferrin is also anti-inflametory. 
-I stayed far away from things that interupt iron absorption- calcium, tannins (from coffee,tea), high dose magnesium. 

I guess thats all!

After waiting an hour post the appointment, the doctor came and started inspecting my foot. I was quite nervous and not able to clearly hear what he was asking me to do (or maybe his instructions were unclear). He was trying to check my stance and figure out what the issue was or something. Finally he snapped a bit at me and I got so awkward üò≠ it made me more nervous.

After all the inspection, he said you need to lose weight. I said okay. Then he went blank with this like smirk on his face and kept staring at me. I stared back. Then he said ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù While maintaining that smirk. Thrice. As if teasing a child for not finishing their homework or stealing candy or something. Expecting me to laugh at myself and his ‚Äújoke‚Äù. Then he said, ‚ÄúYou need to seriously lose it.‚Äù I agree I do, it is causing health issues for me. But the way he said it, it seemed like he was scolding me like a teacher. As if it was implied I was a lazy slob who would probably follow a diet for a day and then go back to eating junk. Then cherry on top, he finally points to my stomach and says, ‚ÄúThis won‚Äôt do‚Äù. All the while laughing. 

He is an excellent doctor and his diagnosis was on point. I respect him and am grateful for his expertise. I also understand that being overweight has brought out a bunch of issues health wise, at least for me. What I don‚Äôt appreciate is his tone.

I followed their art for years and loved the stuff they would do. Then a few years ago I heard they were moving to a new country and they went quiet with very little updates. 

Now, this week I was searching around for some casual artist gatherings in my area and one of the groups made me pause.  The profile picture of the host was in a very distinct and familiar art style. I didn't have to look very far to discover it was definitely the same person. By some strange happenstance they had come all the way from South Africa to my little town in the Pacific Northwest in America, and I had no idea. They traveled across the entire globe to land in my neighborhood. 

I had no choice but to attend the gathering, just to see what would happen. So this weekend I drove to the little coffee shop and found I was the first of the guests to arrive. I introduced myself to the host by my IRL name and settled in, feeling a nervous excitement to break the news. 

I started off by asking them if they were from South Africa, to which they replied,  ""Yeah I am,  how did you know?"" And I gladly related the story of how I had been following their content for a very long time, and how surprised I was that they were in town. 

They were excited and asked me what my online name was. 

""I'm Sam,"" I answered, and watched as they frowned a little, taking a moment to think and try to remember someone by that name. Then their face lit up with the biggest smile, ""Wait, you? YOU'RE SAM? NO WAY!"" We both agreed that it was insane how we just happened to end up in the same area of the world after passively interacting for so many years. 

Eventually everyone else arrived and we settled in to do some art. It was quiet, mostly sitting in silence as we worked on our various projects for a few hours. Very peaceful.

When the time to leave approached we packed up our supplies, and helped clean and move the tables back. The host asked me not to leave quite yet so they could chat with me, and we walked out to the parking lot together and spent a few minutes just talking. We were both mind blown at the odds of meeting each other in such a random place and they said they were so happy to have the chance to meet and thank me for my support over the years. 

We're friends on our socials now. And there's plans brewing to hang out more in the future. This turned out better than I could've hoped.",10,1757963791.0,happy,3,1.0,False

1nhv6q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1nhv6q0/anyone_know_this_one/,Anyone know this one,"For fifteen years, my husband Dustin and I were the fairytale. The high school sweethearts who made it, the tech CEO and his devoted wife. Our life was perfect.
Then a text message arrived from an unknown number. It was a picture of his assistant's hand on his thigh in the suit pants I bought him.
The texts from his mi**ress kept coming after that, a relentless barrage of poison. She sent photos of them in our bed and a video of him promising to leave me. She bragged that she was pr**nant with his child.
He'd come home and k**s me, call me his anchor, all while smelling of her perfume. He was buying her a condo and planning their future while I pretended to have morning sickness from bad scallops.
The final straw came on my birthday. She sent a picture of him on one knee, giving her a diamond promise ring.
So I didn't cry. I secretly changed my name to Hope, converted our entire fortune into untraceable bearer bonds, and told a charity to empty our house of everything.
The next day, as he headed to the airport for a""business trip"" to Paris with her, I flew to Portugal. When he came home, he found an empty mansion, divorce papers, and our wedding rings melted into a single, shapeless lump of gold.

Chapter 1
I remembered the first time Dustin touched my ch**t. We were sixteen, crammed into the back of his dad's old Ford, fogging up the windows.

He was all nervous hands and shaky breaths, fumbling with the clasp of my b*a like he was trying to solve a puzzle in the dark.

I finally had to reach back and unhook it for him. He went beet red, even in the faint moonlight, and stammered an apology.

It was funny. It was sweet.

For fifteen years, he was the only one. The boy who couldn't unhook a b*a became the tech CEO who graced magazine covers.

To the world, we were the fairytale. The high school sweethearts who made it. Eliana and Dustin Powell. A brand. A testament to enduring love in a fast-paced world.

Our life was perfect.

Until it wasn't.

The text message arrived on a Tuesday. An unknown number.

It was just a picture, no words.

A woman's hand, nails painted a garish shade of pink, resting on a man's thigh. The hand was slender, young. Too young.

The thigh was clad in dark gray suit pants I recognized instantly. I'd bought them for him. Tom Ford. For his thirty-second birthday.

On the woman's wrist was a delicate gold bracelet with a single, tiny shark tooth.

I felt the air leave my lungs.

That bracelet. I'd seen it before.

On the wrist of Jami Salinas, his executive assistant. She'd flashed it at the company's summer party, her smile a little too bright, her eyes lingering on me a little too long.

My heart started a frantic, painful rhythm against my ribs.

It couldn't be.

But it was.

My first impulse was to scream. To throw my phone against the wall. To call him and demand an explanation for the image burning itself into my brain.

I didn't.

I took a deep, shuddering breath and forced the rage down. I stared at the photo until the details blurred, until the sickness in my stomach became a cold, hard knot.

Was any of it real? Our fifteen years? The boy in the back of the Ford? The man who ki**ed me goodbye this morning?

The next day, I drove to the county courthouse. The building was old and smelled of dust and stale coffee.

I walked to the clerk's office, my steps even and measured.

""I'd like to file a petition for a name change,"" I told the woman behind the counter.

She looked up, her glasses perched on the end of her nose. ""For what reason?"" 

""Personal reasons,"" I said, my voice flat.

She raised an eyebrow, taking in my clothes, my bag. I was Eliana Powell, wife of a billionaire. Women like me didn't just change their names.

""Are you in danger? Is this related to domestic abuse?"" 

""No,"" I said. The lie tasted like ash, but it was a necessary one. This wasn't about danger. It was about erasure. ""I just want a new name."" 

""What name did you have in mind?"" 

""Hope,"" I said, the word feeling foreign on my tongue. ""Hope Tillman."" Tillman was my mother's maiden name. A name that belonged to me, and me alone.

The clerk typed for a moment. ""And you are currently Eliana David Powell?"" 

""Eliana David,"" I corrected her. I had never taken his name. It was a point of pride once. Now, it was a convenience. ""My legal name is Eliana David."" 

""The process will take a few weeks. You'll have to post a notice, attend a hearing."" 

""I understand,"" I said. ""Please begin the process."" 

She stamped the papers with a loud thud. Each stamp felt like a nail in the coffin of my old life.

Hope. A name for a future I couldn't yet see, but one I would build for myself, brick by painful brick.

The plan formed in my mind with chilling clarity. A new name. A new passport. A new life. Far away from here. Portugal. The Algarve coast. I'd always wanted to photograph the sea caves there.

I got the new social security card first. It came in a plain white envelope. Hope Tillman. It looked like a stranger's name.

I kept my old driver's license. A reminder of the ghost I was preparing to leave behind.

That night, I saw him on TV. He was at a charity gala, looking impossibly handsome in his tuxedo.

The reporter asked him about his success. He smiled that charming, public smile.

He held up his left hand, flashing the simple gold band I'd placed on his finger a decade ago. ""My biggest success is my wife, Eliana. She's my anchor."" 

The crowd applauded. The reporter swooned.

""She's the best thing that ever happened to me."" 

I watched the screen, my face a blank mask. The words meant nothing. They were just sounds, empty air. The man on the screen was a stranger performing a role.

My anchor. He was the storm, and I was the ship he was sinking.

The next morning, I took our wedding rings to a jeweler in a town an hour away. Not a fancy place, just a small, dusty shop run by an old man with a jeweler's loupe permanently attached to his eye.

I placed my ring and Dustin's matching band on the velvet tray. ""I want them melted."" 

A sharp pain shot through my hand, as if the ring was still there, burning my skin. I clenched my fist.

""Melted?"" the old man asked, peering at the rings. ""These are fine pieces. 18-karat gold."" 

""I know what they are,"" I said. ""Melt them. Together. Into a single, shapeless lump."" 

He looked from the rings to my face, his expression unreadable. ""Are you sure, miss? This is... permanent."" 

""Yes,"" I said, my voice unwavering. ""I'm sure."" 

He shrugged and took the rings to the back. I waited, listening to the hum of the polishing wheel and the frantic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner.

An hour later, he returned with a small, gray velvet box.

Inside, resting on the white satin, was a lump of gold. It was ugly. Deformed. All the perfect circles and polished shine were gone, fused into an unrecognizable mass.

It was perfect.

He came home late that night, long after I'd hidden the small box in my closet. He brought me a bouquet of white lilies, my favorite.

""For my beautiful wife,"" he said, ki**ing my cheek.

He smelled of her. That same cloying, fruity perfume Jami always wore.

I didn't pull away. I just stood there, a statue in his arms.

As he moved past me into the kitchen, I saw it. A faint red mark on his neck, just above his collar. A love bite. Sloppy. Careless.

Did you have fun at your ""late meeting,"" Dustin? I wanted to ask. Did you enjoy her young, eager body in your office?

But I said nothing. The time for questions was over.

He wrapped his arms around my waist from behind, pulling me against him. ""I missed you today."" 

I felt a wave of nausea. The touch of his hands on my skin felt like a violation.

I gently pushed him away. ""I'm tired, Dustin.""

Chapter 2
""Tired?"" He sounded surprised. ""Is everything okay, Eli?"" 

""Just a long day,"" I lied, moving towards the stairs.

""Well, let me make it better,"" he said, his voice dropping to a low, su**estive purr. He followed me, his hand reaching for mine.

I flinched away from his touch.

He stopped, a flicker of something-annoyance? confusion?-in his eyes. ""Okay. I get it. I've been working a lot. Let's have a date night tomorrow. Just the two of us. We can go to that place you love, the one by the coast."" 

""Fine,"" I said.

He smiled, relieved. ""Great. I have a surprise for you, too."" 

""I have one for you, as well,"" I said, thinking of the gray velvet box upstairs.

His smile widened. ""Oh yeah? Is it my birthday already?"" 

The question was a bitter joke. My own birthday had been last week. He'd forgotten. Sent a text from a meeting in Tokyo.  'Happy bday, babe. Super busy. Celebrate when I'm back.' He never mentioned it again.

""No,"" I said. ""Just because."" 

He came closer, trying to k**s me. I turned my head, and his lips met my cheek.

""Okay,"" he said, pulling back, looking a little hurt. ""I'll see you in the morning."" 

I lay in bed that night, staring at the ceiling, listening to his steady breathing beside me. This was a performance now. The last act of a long-running play. And I knew my lines.

The next evening, he was all charm, holding the car door open for me, his hand on the small of my back.

He chattered the whole way to the restaurant, talking about a new deal, a difficult board member, a rival company's failure. I made the right noises, nodding and smiling in the right places.

As he pulled into the valet line, something on the passenger side floor caught my eye. A single, long, blonde hair.

Jami's hair.

I looked at it, then looked away. I didn't pick it up. I didn't point it out.

There was no point in fighting anymore. You don't argue with a ghost. And he was already a ghost to me.

The restaurant was where he'd proposed. Perched on a cliff overlooking the ocean, the waves crashing below. It was supposed to be our place.

Tonight, it would be the place where it all ended.

As we walked in, a woman at a nearby table gasped. ""Oh my God, it's Dustin Powell!"" 

He gave her a gracious nod, the tech king in his element.

He'd just called work, a ""quick emergency."" He stood a few feet away, his back to me, his voice low and urgent.

""I'm sorry, baby, I have to step out,"" he said, turning back to me, his face a mask of regret. ""Something's come up at the office. A server farm in quadrant four is down. It's a mess."" 

""Go,"" I said.

""I'll be so quick. Twenty minutes, tops. Don't you move, okay? Order us a bottle of the good stuff."" He winked.

A woman at the next table sighed dreamily. ""He's so dedicated. And so in love with his wife."" 

I knew where he was going. He wasn't talking to his head of engineering. He was talking to Jami. The ""server farm"" was her apartment. The ""emergency"" was her.

I went back to the car. I told the valet I'd forgotten my wrap.

His second phone, the one he thought I didn't know about, was in the glove compartment. It was unlocked.

The texts were right there.

Jami:  'Heard you're on a date with the old lady. Boring.'

Dustin:  'Have to keep up appearances. Be there in 10. Wear that red thing I like.'

Jami:  'Hurry up. I have a surprise for you.'

Then a photo. Jami, pouting at the camera, wearing a red lace teddy. On the nightstand behind her was a small, blue box from Tiffany's.

My stomach churned. I felt a violent, visceral need to throw up. The perfectly cooked scallops I'd just eaten threatened to make a reappearance.

He came back twenty-five minutes later, looking pleased with himself. ""All handled. See? Told you I'd be quick."" 

I forced a smile, the muscles in my face protesting.

""Are you okay?"" he asked, seeing my pale face. ""You look a little green."" 

""Just... the scallops,"" I managed to say. ""Maybe they were a bit off."" 

""That's it,"" he said, his face darkening. ""I'm going to have a word with the manager. This place has gone downhill."" 

""No, Dustin, don't,"" I said. ""It's fine."" 

He looked at me, his brow furrowed. ""You know, I was thinking about what you said. About my birthday. I know I forgot yours. I'm a j**k. I'm so sorry, Eli."" 

The apology, so late, so hollow, hung in the air between us.

""I'm going to make it up to you,"" he said, his voice earnest. ""I promise."" 

I thought of the red lace teddy. The Tiffany box. The server farm in quadrant four.

I felt the vomit rise in my throat. I stumbled out of my chair and ran for the bathroom, barely making it to the stall before I was sick.

Chapter 3
I stayed in the bathroom for a long time, splashing cold water on my face, my reflection a pale, haunted stranger in the mirror.

Dustin was waiting for me, his face etched with concern. ""Are you sure you're okay? We can go home."" 

How could he be so good at this? The lies, the performance. A part of me wondered if he even knew he was doing it anymore. If the line between the loving husband and the cheating ba**ard had blurred so much in his own mind that he couldn't see it.

The cool night air on the drive home cleared my head. The nausea subsided, replaced by a cold, clear calm.

""I'm feeling better,"" I said, as he pulled into the garage.

""Good,"" he said, his hand on my knee. ""Because I still have that surprise for you."" 

""Tomorrow,"" I said. ""Let's do surprises tomorrow."" 

He looked disappointed but nodded. ""Okay. Tomorrow."" 

A wicked little idea sparked in my mind. A final, parting shot.

""Actually,"" I said, turning to him. ""I've been thinking. You're right. We need more time together. Why don't you take tomorrow off? We can spend the whole day together. Here. At home."" 

He looked surprised. Then a little panicked. A whole day. A whole day he couldn't sneak away to see Jami.

""I... I don't know, Eli. I have that big presentation..."" 

""Reschedule it,"" I said, my voice sweet. ""For me."" 

He chewed his lip, cornered. ""Okay,"" he said finally, forcing a smile. ""For you. Anything."" 

We went to bed. He fell asleep almost instantly. I waited until his breathing was deep and even, then slipped out of the room.

I went to his office. His work laptop was on his desk. He used the same password for everything. Our anniversary. The irony was thick enough to choke on.

I found what I was looking for in his deleted items folder. He wasn't as smart as he thought he was.

A video. Jami, again. This time she was in his office, perched on his desk, wearing nothing but his dress shirt.

""Dustin, baby,"" she cooed, running a hand down her thigh. ""When are you going to leave her? She's so old and boring. I'm so much more fun."" 

He didn't reply, but I could hear his low chuckle off-camera.

I closed the laptop, my hands steady. The pain was a distant echo now. All I felt was a profound, bottomless disgust.

I went back to our bedroom. He'd rolled over in his sl**p, one arm flung across my side of the bed, searching for me.

""Eli?"" he murmured, half-asleep.

""I'm here,"" I said, my voice a wh**per.

He sighed and settled back into sl**p.

In the morning, his phone started buzzing at 6 a.m. It buzzed again. And again. A relentless, insistent rhythm.

""Goddammit,"" he groaned, rolling over and grabbing it from the nightstand. ""What the h**l does she want now?"" 

He got out of bed, walking into the adjoining bathroom to take the call. He thought I couldn't hear. He was wrong.

""What, Jami?"" he hissed. ""I told you I'm taking the day off... No, you can't come over... Because Eliana is here, that's why... Look, just handle it. I'll call you later."" 

He came back into the bedroom, looking annoyed. I saw him slip the phone into the pocket of his robe.

""Work?"" I asked, feigning sleepiness.

""Yeah,"" he grunted. ""St**id emergency. I handled it."" 

He went downstairs. A few minutes later, the smell of coffee and bacon filled the house. He was making breakfast. A grand gesture.

He came up with a tray laden with food. Pancakes, eggs, bacon, fresh-squeezed orange juice. A feast.

""I was thinking,"" he said, setting the tray on the bed. ""You do so much around here. Maybe we should hire a housekeeper. A cook, even. Take some of the pressure off you."" 

He wanted to replace me. In every way.

""No, thank you,"" I said. ""I like taking care of our home."" My home. Not for much longer.

I picked at the food, my appetite gone.

""So,"" I said, looking at him over my coffee cup. ""Are we okay, you and I?"" 

He looked startled. ""Of course, we're okay. Why would you even ask that?"" 

""No reason,"" I said.

He reached across the tray and took my hand. His was warm and strong. It felt like a stranger's.

""Eliana,"" he said, his voice thick with sincerity. ""I love you. You know that, right? I would never, ever do anything to hurt you. You are my world."" 

I looked into his eyes, a deep, earnest blue. He was a phenomenal liar. Or maybe he believed it himself.

""I would die before I betrayed you,"" he said.

I almost laughed.

""Good to know,"" I said, pulling my hand away. I stood up and walked to the closet. ""I'm going to get dressed."" 

He looked relieved, the conversation over.

As I was pulling on a sweater, I asked, casually, ""So, where did you put my birthday gift?"" 

He froze. ""Your... gift?"" 

""From last week,"" I said, turning to face him. ""You said you had one for me."" 

He was a deer in the headlights. He had nothing. He'd completely forgotten.

Chapter 4
I drove with him to his office the next morning. It was part of my little game. The last one I would ever play.

""I'll just sit in the back,"" I told him when he gestured for me to get in the passenger seat of his Tesla.

""Why? Are you still feeling sick?"" 

""The motion,"" I lied smoothly. ""It's better for me back here."" 

He shrugged, accepting it. He was too self-absorbed to question anything for long.

We pulled up to the gleaming glass tower of Powell Industries. The moment he stepped out of the car, he was swarmed. Employees, executives, all vying for a moment of his attention.

""Mr. Powell, good morning!"" 

""Sir, the numbers from the Asian market are in. They're incredible!"" 

A young woman, one of his VPs, rushed forward. ""Eliana! You look stunning, as always. That color is divine on you."" 

She was fawning, her eyes flicking between me and Dustin, calculating.

Dustin laughed, draping an arm around my shoulders. ""She's always stunning. I'm the luckiest man alive."" 

Another executive chimed in, ""Seriously, you two are relationship goals. My wife is always asking me why I can't be more like you, Dustin."" 

They all laughed. It was a chorus of sycophants.

Dustin basked in it. ""Just treat her like a queen, Bob. That's the secret."" 

I was ushered into his corner office, a vast space with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city. A bottle of champagne was chilling in an ice bucket. A platter of pastries and fruit sat on the low coffee table.

""I told them to get all your favorites,"" he said, gesturing to the spread. ""Make yourself comfortable. I have a few fires to put out, then I'm all yours."" 

He set up a tablet for me, queued up with my favorite shows. A pathetic attempt to placate me, to keep me occupied while he went about his real business.

""So, who's your emergency today?"" I asked, my voice light. ""Jami?"" 

He flinched, just for a second. ""What? No. It's... it's a legal thing. Boring stuff."" 

He ki**ed my forehead. ""Be back soon."" 

He left, closing the heavy glass door behind him.

He'd left his personal phone on the desk. The one he used for me, for family. The bait.

I waited a full five minutes before I got up. I picked up the phone and walked to the door. I could hear voices from the hallway.

Two junior executives, gossiping by the water cooler.

""Did you hear? Jami's pr**nant,"" one said.

""No way. With his kid?"" the other whispered.

""Who else? She's been bragging about it all morning. Said he's going to leave the wife and marry her."" 

""Wow. The Iceman finally knocked someone up."" 

Iceman. That was their nickname for him. It was because he never sl**t with anyone at the office. A rule he'd obviously broken. For her.

""He bought her a condo in the city, you know,"" the first one said. ""And a new car. She's set."" 

""Poor Eliana. She has no idea."" 

I felt a cold dread seep into my bones, a realization that this was so much worse than I had imagined. The secret apartment. The pr**nancy. It all clicked into place. The morning sickness I'd been faking for him was a sick parody of what was really happening.

Dustin appeared at the end of the hall. He saw the two men gossiping and his face darkened.

""Get back to work,"" he snapped.

They scurried away like frightened rats.

One of them, the bolder one, glanced back. ""Congrats on the baby, boss."" 

Dustin's face went white with fury. ""What did you say?"" 

""Nothing, sir. Sorry, sir."" 

""If I hear another word of this, you're both fired. Understand?"" 

I slipped back into the office before he could see me. I placed his phone back on the desk, exactly where he'd left it.

He came in a moment later, forcing a smile. ""Sorry about that. Office drama."" 

He came over and wrapped his arms around me. I had to fight the urge to recoil.

""Where were you just now?"" I asked, my voice steady.

He looked for his phone, his eyes scanning the desk. He saw it and relaxed.

""Just talking to legal,"" he said.

Just then, my new phone, the cheap burner I'd bought for cash, rang in my purse.

""Excuse me,"" I said, pulling it out.

""Is this Hope Tillman?"" a woman's voice asked.

""Yes, this is she,"" I said, my heart giving a little leap.

""This is Air Portugal, confirming your flight to Lisbon tomorrow at 9 a.m. As you're traveling on a new passport, please be sure to bring your official name change documentation to the airport."" 

""I have it right here,"" I said. ""Just the passport and the court order? Nothing else?"" 

""That's correct, Ms. Tillman."" 

""Thank you."" 

I hung up.

Dustin was watching me, a frown on his face. ""Who was that?""

Chapter 5
""A travel agency,"" I said, slipping the phone back into my purse. ""Confirming a spa weekend I booked for my mom."" 

The lie came easily. I was getting good at them.

He bought it, his expression softening into one of exaggerated concern. He pulled me into a hug, his chin resting on top of my head. ""That's so sweet of you, Eli. You're the best daughter. The best wife."" 

His touch made my skin crawl. I felt the familiar wave of nausea rise again.

""I think I'm going to be sick,"" I said, pushing him away.

""It's those d**n scallops,"" he fumed. ""I'm going to call that restaurant and have their heads. No one makes my wife sick."" 

""Dustin, stop it!"" I snapped, my voice sharper than I intended. The sudden venom in my tone surprised even me.

He looked taken aback, his eyes wide with confusion. ""Eli? What's wrong?"" He tried to touch my arm, and I recoiled.

""Don't,"" I said. I took a deep breath, reining in the anger. ""I'm sorry. I just... I have a headache. I don't want you to make a scene."" 

""Okay, baby. Okay,"" he said, his voice soft and placating. ""Whatever you want."" 

The sky outside the massive window had turned a bruised purple. A storm was rolling in. It matched the tempest in my soul.

I went to the private bathroom adjoining his office and stared at myself in the mirror. I looked pale, my eyes shadowed with a pain he was too blind to see.

He appeared in the reflection behind me, his expression one of perfect, practiced worry.

Was he even capable of genuine emotion? Or was it all just an act, a part he played to get what he wanted?

Society forgave men like Dustin. They were powerful, charismatic. They made mistakes, sure. A little slip-up. A dalliance. The world would wag its finger, then welcome him back with open arms. The wife was expected to stand by him, a silent, smiling prop. Forgive and forget.

Not this wife. Not anymore. I would not accept a love that was fractured, a commitment that was a lie. I deserved more. I deserved whole.

Or I would have nothing at all.

""Let's get you to a doctor,"" he said, his hand on my back. ""I know a guy. The best in the city. He'll see you right away."" 

We went to a private clinic that catered to the ultra-rich. The doctor, a man with silver hair and a kind smile, ran some tests.

""It's not food poisoning,"" he said, looking at me over his spectacles. ""It's stress. A severe psychosomatic reaction to emotional distress."" 

Dustin was in the waiting room. The doctor called him in.

""Is she okay?"" Dustin asked, all anxious husband.

""Physically, she's fine,"" the doctor said. ""But her body is reacting to something that's causing her great emotional pain. Has something happened recently? A loss? A shock?"" 

Dustin looked at me, a question in his eyes. ""Eli? Is there something you're not telling me?"" 

I just shook my head.

""Whatever it is, I can fix it,"" Dustin said, turning back to the doctor, his voice full of his usual arrogance. ""Just tell me who to call, who to sue, who to fire."" 

I almost laughed. You can't fire a mi**ress who's carrying your child, Dustin. You can't sue your own lies.

The one person who could fix this was me. And my solution was to disappear.

I was going to chase my own dream. My photography. The career I'd put on hold for him, for his rise. I would find my own peace, my own future.

""I'm going to take the rest of the week off,"" he announced on the way home. ""We'll just relax. Maybe go to the beach house."" 

""And your big presentation?"" I asked.

""I'll have Jami handle it,"" he said, without a trace of irony.

His second phone rang. The one in his pocket. He glanced at the screen, his jaw tightening.

""Ignore it,"" I said.

""It's work,"" he said.

""You promised,"" I said, my voice quiet. ""You promised you'd be all mine."" 

I saw the flicker of annoyance, the struggle. He wanted to take the call.

""Let them wait,"" I said, a challenge in my voice.

He looked at me, then back at the ringing phone. Finally, with a sigh, he silenced it.

But a moment later, it rang again.

I could hear a faint, tinny sound from the receiver. A woman crying.

He saw the look on my face and quickly lowered the volume. ""It's just Jami,"" he said, his voice a little too casual. ""Her mom is sick."" 

""Oh, the poor thing,"" I said, my voice dripping with false sympathy. ""You should go to her. She clearly needs you."" 

He looked relieved. ""You're sure? I can be back in an hour."" 

""Take your time,"" I said. ""Family is important."" 

He gave me a quick, grateful k**s and got out of the car. I watched him jog across the street, not towards the office, but towards the luxury condo building where I now knew she lived.

Jami's text came a moment later. A picture of her, looking tearful, holding a positive pr**nancy test.

The caption read:  'He's all mine now. You lose.'

Chapter 6
Her texts kept coming, a relentless barrage of poison.

 'He's taking me to dinner at your favorite place tonight. To celebrate.'

 'He says he's never been happier. We talked about baby names.'

 'He's finally realized what a cold, boring bi**h you are. It's over, Eliana. Just give up.'

I didn't reply. I just stared at the screen, the words blurring into a meaningless jumble. The pain was gone, replaced by a vast, cold emptiness.

I drove straight to my lawyer's office.

Laura was a shark in a designer suit. She'd handled my prenuptial agreement years ago.

""I want to file for divorce,"" I said, sitting in the plush leather chair opposite her desk.

She didn't look surprised. ""Infidelity?"" 

""And then some,"" I said. I told her everything. The assistant. The pr**nancy. The lies.

""And I want nothing,"" I said. ""Not a single penny."" 

Her eyebrows shot up. ""Eliana, the prenup is ironclad, but you're still entitled to a significant settlement. We're talking hundreds of millions."" 

""I don't want his money,"" I said. ""I want to be free. I want to disappear."" 

I told her my plan. The name change. The new life.

She listened, her expression unreadable. When I was finished, she leaned back in her chair. ""It's bold. It's clean. But he will fight it."" 

""I know,"" I said. ""That's why I need the divorce papers ready to go. But don't file them yet."" 

She nodded, understanding. ""A parting gift."" 

""Exactly."" 

I left her office with a thick manila envelope in my bag. The divorce petition. Signed, sealed, and ready.

Dustin called me that evening.

""Hey, babe. Where are you?"" 

""Out with friends,"" I lied.

""Oh. Okay."" He sounded disappointed. ""I was going to come home, but Jami's mom took a turn for the worse. I think I should stay here, at the hospital."" 

The hospital. Right.

""You do what you have to do,"" I said, my voice flat.

""I'll make it up to you, I promise,"" he said. ""I love you."" 

""I know,"" I said, and hung up.

The lies didn't even hurt anymore. They were just... noise.

I called him back a few minutes later.

""Eli? Is everything okay?"" 

""I was just thinking,"" I said. ""If you ever did cheat on me, I'd leave. I'd just... walk away and never look back."" 

He laughed. A short, arrogant bark. ""Don't be ridiculous. You'd never leave me. You couldn't. Where would you even go?"" 

My new passport, tucked safely in my purse, felt warm against my fingers. Hope Tillman. She could go anywhere.

""I'm more resourceful than you think,"" I said.

""Is that a challenge?"" he asked, his voice laced with amusement.

""Maybe,"" I said.

""Alright, I'll play,"" he said. ""You try to leave me. Let's see how far you get."" 

I smiled. A real smile, for the first time in days. ""Game on, Dustin.""

Along with that came bloating, light migraines, and mood changes that feel stronger than before. I went to the gynecologist and basic tests like thyroid and iron were fine.

1nhv26d,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1nhv26d/i_improved_my_heavy_caffeine_addiction_with_logic/,I improved my heavy caffeine addiction with logic and new rule.,"It was a nightmare to observe observations of rapid atherosclerosis, from drinking concentrated coffee with cream and drinking energy drinks.

Yet, because of being deficient in dopamine and hypogonadic, I as always was neglecting very basic necessities of life, allowing this cause of highest damage just continue unattended, for weeks, for months, for a year.

Initially I didn't even understand what was happening, and after months of same struggle took a blood test on diabetes, not having it.

Then switching between coffee and energy drinks, again not understanding.

Then it all clicked, and I postponed dealing with this for about a month now, but today after getting my energy I decided to handle this task (instead of other pressing tasks in life as usual).

I became fed up, and decided to stand up for myself, making a logic, and making decisions of a rule for my health. Never did it before. Here it is.



I decided I will only drink black coffee and tea for caffeine as my only choice forever. ((This is the rule I was talking about))¬†



I decided I will never again in my life consume energy drinks and concentrated coffee with cream, because they cause insane maximal amount of atherosclerosis and arterial damage. I decided to consume only black coffee and tea forever if and when I will decide to consume caffeine (which now is daily). I learned from my experiences, and now I choose a categorically better option, truly forever.¬†

Black coffee and tea give me caffeine energy. Black coffee and tea do not contain added sugar caramel, and plant toxins and microplastics, and their dosage of caffeine is very small, this is how they are extremely safer.¬†

I will never allow myself to experience diabetes mimicking extreme damage from worst form of caffeine, combined with sugar and in maximal dosage, from energy drinks. I will always forever choose better option which is black coffee and tea. 

I even have a dissolvable coffee jar right on my desk now, to never forget to never go and buy an energy drink out of instinct.

I also made a rule to counteract caffeine from black coffee and tea with consuming raw eggs (raw fat helps), and consuming extra water. To help arteries.

1nhv1cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1nhv1cs/i_work_as_a_waitress_a_diner_and_i_think_one_of/,"I work as a waitress a diner , and I think one of our regulars might be the devil.","I work at a rest-stop diner in a town people pass through as quick as they can on their way to something, or someone, better. It‚Äôs called Lucky‚Äôs, which is a little ironic because if you‚Äôve ended up here you‚Äôre anything but. If you stay too long the dust settles. Working at Lucky‚Äôs you never see the same licence plates twice, or faces for that matter. I‚Äôve lost count of the amount of times the answer to my ‚ÄúWhere you heading?‚Äù has been ‚ÄúAnywhere but back.‚Äù The lights flicker more often than not, and the jukebox sometimes spits out songs that aren't on the index cards, but the coffee‚Äôs hot, and most people who try them say the pancakes are the best they‚Äôll ever have, and I‚Äôm inclined to agree.

The embroidered name tag on my uniform reads Isabella, but that ain‚Äôt even close to my real name. It was my mom's. Lucky‚Äôs has been here a long time. I wear it because I like hearing her name said by other people. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs still here, still coming up in conversation. Like she might walk through the door any second and isn‚Äôt buried in the cemetery just past the strip club.

Lucky‚Äôs is also always open. Always. Working long shifts serving drifters and truckers and runaways, those who have become impermanent out on the highways, you get to know how to read people pretty quick. When you move around that much, always on the road, you leave parts of yourself behind sometimes, lost between the miles. Sometimes, people are just driving because there‚Äôs nothing else left to do. Working at Lucky‚Äôs I‚Äôve seen all sorts of lost things.

I once saw a man hit a deer with his truck and pull over to bury it in the red dirt, digging as the sun went down, tears a steady flow down his face as he fought the ground to cover up what he had done. I once had a man I recognised from the news leave me a blood stained $20 as a tip, sad-eyed in a denim jacket that barely hid the gun taped to his ribs. I once saw a one-armed girl no more than sixteen stand up on the roof of her car and sing, until a coyote came and sat in front of the hood, howling along. I once saw two women fistfight in the parking lot in the night outside, until one was spitting blood and teeth and then they kissed in the blue lights of the police car that happened to pass them by, faces lit up red and shining.

I‚Äôve seen the highway on fire, lines of flames between tires as the asphalt set itself alight in the heat. I‚Äôve seen roadside baptisms, preacher pulled up with a van and a kiddie pool. I‚Äôve seen things walking out in the desert just beyond reach of the neon sign for the motel that don‚Äôt look quite like people, shifting out in the blue night. I met a woman who showed me a photograph of the place she was buried. I often meet people who you talk with a while until their faces start to flicker, can‚Äôt quite hold up the pretence that long. I‚Äôve met people who have to be invited inside, before they can cross the threshold. I‚Äôve met some lovely members of a sacrificial cult who tipped well and were oh so polite, even when they asked me if I‚Äôd consider letting them harvest me.

But this is a story about - well, you read the title.

It was a Friday and I was working a night shift. I prefer nights, because when I drive home I can pretend for a while that I‚Äôm going to follow the taillights of the car in front until I leave everything in my rearview mirror, until it gets light and the desert changes to ocean, like if I rolled my windows all the way down I‚Äôd taste salt on the air. That, and I‚Äôm one of the only waitresses, shall we say, qualified, to deal with the night customers. Besides, tips are always better when the moon is out. We only have three true regulars in Lucky‚Äôs, and only two had showed so far.

Rose-Marie, our first and most frequent regular, was sat by the window in her brown fur coat, always drawn about her shoulders come rain or shine. Not that it ever rained here. Her hair was long and white down her back, like the moon through a glass. She waved over to me, gracing me with a wink that made her crows feet deepen, all the more beautiful for it. Rose-Marie liked whiskey in her tea. Sometimes, she fed cake crumbs to the voodoo dolls she carried in her pockets. She was also a chronic insomniac and liked the company of Lucky‚Äôs when sleep was hiding from her.

She continued to shuffle through the deck of cards she had already set up on the table top. I watched her thumbs flipping over two jokers. Rose-Marie liked to divine the future, when she had the time. She used a frayed pack of hotel playing cards, and if she was in a good mood she‚Äôd read your coffee grounds. I didn‚Äôt ask her too much, because those coffee grounds had a startling way of coming true.

Table 6 was empty, and spotless as usual. It was the only table without a salt shaker, and the only one I never placed cutlery on. Only one person ever sat there.

Our second regular, Jones, was sat in his usual booth, dregs of his black coffee held tight between his hands, badge resting on the table. He had his eyes closed, head bent down like he was repenting, steam curling off the lip of the mug and wrapping round his fingers. Jones was my favourite of our customers, not that I‚Äôd ever tell him. I walked past the booth and slid a bowl of sugar packets along the tabletop until it hit the mug with a soft clink. He jumped, reaching for his holster out of habit, until his eyes focused and he saw me.

He smiled, embarrassed, and it changed his face, dragging him back to life. When he smiled it was like a storm in a drought, made you want to stand and watch, and maybe stay out in it just a while longer. I wanted to put my hands over his where they had resumed their place on the mug, to feel the second hand heat through his palms.

Sometimes I can sense the sad in people just by the feel of their skin. They carry it around with them, bone deep, trying to hide it from the world. But sometimes you can lift it from them for a minute or two, if you have enough kindness spare. It doesn‚Äôt take much, most times. Jones was too young to be that sad. And yet.

‚ÄúTired today?‚Äù I gestured with the coffee pot to his half empty cup. Everyone knew about the little girl he‚Äôd pulled from the dumpsters outside the swimming pool last week. She was the fifth one missing in three months. I could tell from the shadows like purple thumb prints beneath his eyes he‚Äôd been dreaming about her. She‚Äôd been found without her shoes on. He‚Äôd carried her to the ambulance in her socks, pink with little daisies on ‚Äòem, small in his arms like she was asleep.

Lou the fry cook had cried when I‚Äôd told him that the other day. I really liked Lou. He was almost too big to fit through the service door, and had a tattoo of his dog just below the one of the angel of death on his shoulder. Lou sheds a tear for most things. The dead racoons we‚Äôre always finding by the backdoor with their hands missing. Whenever there‚Äôs a new missing poster plastered over the cracked glass of the phone booth in the parking lot. Every time he hears I Will Forever Hate Roses when it decides to pop up on the jukebox. Big guy, bigger heart.

‚ÄúAlways tired,‚Äù Jones said as I poured. Another girl had gone missing yesterday. As I poured, I made sure to brush his thumb where it rested on the cup handle with the inside of my wrist, lifting out that sadness as far as I could. He smiled up at me, shy, and I smiled back before I could stop myself.

I walked on to the next booth, two truckers with faces that had seen too much sun. One was showing the other the photos of his new baby in his wallet. He had tobacco stained teeth, a scab on his cheek and wind-chapped lips - and his smile was the most beautiful damn thing as he talked about his kid, lit up like christmas morning. He showed me too as I refilled his coffee, and I stayed and talked to them a while.

The other trucker, with gold back teeth, told me how he‚Äôd used to drive pigs, but couldn't handle the guilt when he handed them over to the slaughterhouse. Said he‚Äôd look right into their pink faces through the slats and their eyes looked right back, bright and pleading like they knew what he‚Äôd done. Said he still dreamt about them. Now he drove freezers of seafood, specialty deliveries for fancy hotels. He‚Äôd never seen the ocean.

Lou slammed the bell from the depths of the kitchen and I got back to work, taking orders from a woman with a Labrador who ordered hot dogs for them both, and three teenage boys in their blood-stained varsity jackets in the corner, who had ten dollars between them and asked for as many waffles as they could get.

They often came in on full moons, leaving their bikes chained up in the parking lot. They were always hunting something, with their baseball bats, backpacks filled with bullets and their daddies‚Äô guns, but they were nice kids so I always gave them extra scoops of ice-cream. Besides, I knew they needed the energy, because when they were hunting they had to run fast. Real fast. There used to be four of them.

I cleared the table from the two women at the next booth on my way back. They looked to be twins, both dressed in long silk skirts and hiking boots, red hair piled up messy on top of their heads.

Neither acknowledged me, not out of rudeness but because they were too preoccupied, packing up their bags, overspilling with maps and notebooks. I spied a roll of duct tape and a bottle of vodka in there too, along with some stakes and crucifixes. They were deep in conversation, waving their hands and I caught a little of it as I stacked their empty glasses, lipsticked round the rims.

‚ÄúI know where I buried him Sylvia-,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know jackshit! We dug for hours, and-‚Äù

My mom always taught me eavesdropping was rude, so I left them to it and headed into the kitchen. But I got the sense that wherever they had left, whoever he was, he certainly wasn‚Äôt there no more. I felt like telling them, but like my mom said, it‚Äôs not polite to listen to other people‚Äôs conversations. You never know what you‚Äôll wish you hadn‚Äôt heard.

Lou was dancing to the radio, swaying his hips to Sugar Hill as Dolly sang down the wires. He waved at me with the spatula he was using as a microphone.

Carlos handed me a plate of pancakes.

Carlos had worked here so long he‚Äôd known my Mom, and was the only one who new my real name. He sometimes came with me on the weekends to change the flowers on her grave. He always brought her desert flowers, growing from the same earth she was. Carlos was also the only one who knew the recipe for the Lucky‚Äôs pancakes, and the only one that could cook them right. On days when he wasn‚Äôt working, we had no pancakes. Simple as. That was just the way it went. I‚Äôd learnt that the hard way, but that‚Äôs another story.

Along with the pancakes, came a warning.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs back.‚Äù He gestured through the doors. ‚ÄúTable 6.‚Äù

Our final regular had showed. It had been a while since he‚Äôd been around. I hadn‚Äôt even seen him come in, but that wasn‚Äôt unusual. He moved in mysterious ways. I raised an eyebrow. Shit. Carlos raised one back. Oh shit. He tossed me the salt with a grimace, and I filled the pockets of my apron. Lou banged around in one of the staff lockers for a moment, until he emerged triumphant, waving a bible that had definitely seen better days. He placed in on the counter next to the syrup jugs and flipped to a random page.

We leant over his huge shoulders to read what it said. ‚ÄúKeep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent and righteous, for I will not acquit the wicked.‚Äù Lou shrugged and patted me on the shoulder.

I don‚Äôt get paid enough for this shit.

I took the pancakes to table 6, which had been empty the last time I‚Äôd looked. It was now very much occupied. The man sat at table 6 was smiling as I walked over. If you could call it a smile. It was more like rictus, lips straining deep red at the corners of his face. His eyes kept darting from side to side, too fast to count, like his pupils couldn't make up their mind where they should be. His hands shook as I got closer, hovering like flies on a carcass.

I tried to lean as far away from him as I could as I placed the plate on the tabletop, but as I pulled my hands away he darted his neck out fast, whipping his head up and tilting his face towards me. He sniffed in, hard, eyelids fluttering. He giggled, shrill like it was stuck on the roof of his mouth. I recoiled, trying to hide the urge I had to run back to the kitchen. There‚Äôs something about hearing a grown man giggle that makes the skin crawl.

‚ÄúCan I get you anything?‚Äù I asked, faking bright.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd take your name.‚Äù He gripped one of the pancakes in his fist, turning it to mush.

I tapped the name tag on my uniform. He shook his head, grinning, shoulders almost vibrating with this strange fluid roll as his smile slipped for a second, front teeth jutting suddenly, tongue sharply poking out. Filth was caked under his nails, red like the dirt on the sides of the road. Then he was smiling again, swaying slowly from side to side, feral, in his hunting jacket. His hair hung in greasy strings around his ears, like blonde rattails, and they swung with him, back and forth.

‚ÄúIsabella, Isabella, Isabella. It don‚Äôt suit.‚Äù He suddenly slammed his hand up to his face, shovelling the crushed pancake into the gaping hole of his wide mouth. I jerked back, the movement was so sudden. I shoved my hands into my apron, reaching for the salt, and his eyes narrowed.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for that,‚Äù came a voice from behind me. It rolled across my shoulders, deep, to the bone. Mr Prince.

I turned to face our third regular, relief mixing with fear in a swirling pit in my chest. Kinda like that feeling you get at a fairground in midsummer, when you‚Äôve been on a carousel too long, and part of you knows you need to get off, but the other part doesn‚Äôt want to leave because you know as soon as you stand still you‚Äôre gonna be sick. Mr. Prince had that effect on people.

Mr. Prince was dressed, as always, in his black pinstripe. His stetson was darker than the night outside, and his boots shone like they were wet. If you didn‚Äôt notice the upside down crucifixes embroidered daintily onto his custom lapels, you‚Äôd think he was just a man with money, maybe mixed up in something a little shady, like oil, or pharmaceuticals. He was handsome by the way of his jaw, with his bone white smile, but his black sunglasses were balanced on the bridge of his nose, silver rimmed and gleaming, hiding his eyes as usual. When he spoke it was a drawl, dragged up from the depths of the South.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for my‚Ä¶ acquaintance. He‚Äôs a little‚Ä¶‚Äù Mr Prince glanced at the man sat at table 6 as he panted with his tongue hung out, like a dog. ‚Äú‚Ä¶over excited.‚Äù Mr Prince sat down and the lights above the booth flickered. He tilted his hat back on his head and the jukebox coughed and skipped, and suddenly Robert Johnson was on and singing about that damn crossroad again. Mr Prince popped a Marlboro Red between his teeth, and pushed the window open a sliver with the knuckles of his left hand. The silver pentagram ring on his wedding finger clacked against the glass.

Mr. Prince smiled, the way snakes do when they‚Äôre watching you from the grass on their bellies. The cigarette was now smoking between his teeth, although he hadn‚Äôt moved.

‚ÄúBesides, Leroy ain‚Äôt the type for salt. He‚Äôs just a man.‚Äù He looked him up and down and his top lip curled. ‚ÄúBarely.‚Äù He turned to Leroy. ‚ÄúI see you started on my pancakes. But what‚Äôs the point of good food if it ain‚Äôt for sharing.‚Äù Leroy giggled that strange high sound that made me want to run, and shook a little. Everything about Leroy made me nervous, fight or flight getting ready to flood my system.

Mr Prince handed Leroy a menu. ‚ÄúOrder whatever you want.‚Äù He leant forward and the lights flickered.

Leroy ordered four cheeseburgers, and glass of milk. ‚ÄúWell, if that‚Äôs all!‚Äù I managed. I could feel Leroy‚Äôs eyes clinging to my back as I left. Rose-Marie waved me over before I could get back to the safety of the kitchen.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt worry about him, darlin‚Äô.‚Äù She crossed herself, and tapped the card on top of the pile. The Jack of Spades. It had its eyes scratched out. But not by Rose-Marie. It looked like it had been printed that way for years. ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt be seeing him again.‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt talking about Mr. Prince. She cupped my cheek and I leant into it, her hand rough with age, but warm. I could tell she thought I looked tired. She paid for her tea and toast, and walked out into the warm night waiting outside the doors.

I finally made it back into the kitchen and was immediately attacked. Cold water doused me in the face and I threw up my arms on instinct, trying to protect my hair. Lou aggressively squirted me in the face with the spray bottle we also kept in the staff locker, the kind you use for tending house plants. Ours was filled with holy water.

‚ÄúLou! Jesus fuckin‚Äô Christ, get off I‚Äôm-‚Äú I sputtered, and he sprayed me again. I spat holy water out, dripping down the front of my dress and wiped it from my eyes, makeup running a little. I grabbed the bottle from his hands. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm good.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt really mad though, better safe than sorry, especially when it comes to possession.

‚ÄúSorry! Just checkin‚Äô.‚Äù Lou sheepishly handed me a dish towel. ‚ÄúAlready did me ‚Äôn‚Äô Carlos.‚Äù He looked down at his shoes, awkward. He was a foot taller than me and a decade older, and I hid my smile because he was twisting the toe of his boot back and forth like a little kid been kept after class.

Carlos kept his eyes firmly fixed on his hands as he started flipping patties, but I could sense him holding back a laugh, desperately clenching his teeth. I narrowed my eyes and aimed the spray bottle at him. ‚ÄúMaybe you need some more,‚Äù I threatened. Lou snorted and then Carlos was laughing and I was too, and that heavy feeling that had hovered over us since Mr. Prince had walked in lifted.

Sometimes when things get too dark, all you can do is laugh. Mom always said that when shit gets rough, you can either choose to laugh or cry. I never saw my mother cry.

It was coming up on 3 in the morning as I took the burgers back to table 6. Leroy visibly drooled and clapped his hands as I walked over. I put the plate in front of him as quick as I could but as I pulled back, his head darted forward and he licked the inside of my wrist. His tongue was long and wet against my pulse. I recoiled like I‚Äôd been bitten and he laughed, shrill and manic.

‚ÄúYou taste better than they will,‚Äù he said, grinning and gesturing to the burgers. Mr. Prince watched this unfold, calm and unreadable like the sky before summer lighting burns down a tree. I frantically wiped my arm on my apron, but I could still feel that tongue on my skin as if I‚Äôd left my hand in his mouth. I fought off the tears that suddenly burned at the corners of my eyes, because something told me Leroy would enjoy them just a little too much. I shuddered, and cleared Mr. Prince‚Äôs plate.

‚ÄúTell Carlos the pancakes were‚Ä¶ good as hell,‚Äù he said, from behind his sunglasses. Then he chuckled, low and raspy, as if something he‚Äôd said was funny. He popped another Marlbro between his teeth and it started to glow, as Leroy shovelled meat down his throat. I tried not to gag as I watched it clog beneath his long nails.

I walked by Jones on my way back. He waved me over, eyes creased with worry. He ran a hand over his face, as if he was trying to wipe all the bad things away.

‚ÄúIs he botherin‚Äô you?‚Äù He gestured over to Leroy who was rocking back and forth drinking his milk. Jones suddenly looked so tired, uniform creased as his face, looking fifty instead of his twenty two. ‚ÄúNothing I can‚Äôt handle,‚Äù I shook my head and thought about Rose-Marie. ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt be seeing him again.‚Äù

It felt like hours waiting for Leroy to finish. I took the order of a man with a butterfly tattooed on his neck, and some truckers pouring Jim Beam into their coffee. They asked me for an extra cup which they placed at the empty seat on their table, for absent friends, they said. I cleaned down the counter top, restocked the sugar packets, and took out the trash, ignoring the man in the rabbit mask that often waits out by the dumpsters. As long as you don‚Äôt look at him, he doesn‚Äôt bother you. I refilled coffee cups, and took the orders of the large group of biker girls that came in, leather clad and road weary.

At 3:03am, Mr. Prince stood. Leroy had licked his plate clean and was sitting still, staring up at him with his teeth bared in a smile, hands gripping the table top so hard his knuckles were going white as milk. Mr. Prince handed me a roll of bills wrapped in black plastic that I knew better than to count. He tipped his hat.

‚ÄúSee Leroy. We all gotta pay eventually,‚Äù he said. He leaned in and spoke softly. ‚ÄúFor I will not acquit the wicked,‚Äù he smiled. He held out his hand to Leroy, palm flat, waiting. Leroy‚Äôs hands shook as he reached into his hunting jacket and pulled out a pair of shoes. A child‚Äôs shoes, small enough that both could fit in one hand. Little pink sneakers, dirty, with brown stains on the toes that I knew could only be one thing. Mr Prince considered them a moment, under the lights, and shook his head.

He seemed like he was sorry, before he handed them to me. ‚ÄúFor your man over there. Tell him to dig deeper where they looked last.‚Äù  He nodded to Jones, who was watching us, his badge gripped in his hand. But Jones knew better than to come over.

Mr. Prince turned to Leroy and grinned around his cigarette. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a ways to go, the road we‚Äôre takin‚Äô. They say it‚Äôs paved with good intentions.‚Äù He chuckled, and I felt sick to my stomach. He took Leroy‚Äôs hand, like a child, and they walked out into the night, warm and waiting. The doors swung shut behind them, even though nobody had touched them. The jukebox sputtered, and Chris Rea was on, singing about that road again.

I placed the shoes on the table by Jone‚Äôs empty coffee cup, and passed on the message. He sat still for a long time after, just watching them on the table top, trying not to cry or scream or punch a hole in the plaster. All I could do was refill his coffee, because when someone is trying to hold themselves together like that, there‚Äôs nothing left to say.

My shift ended, and I drove myself home, following the taillights in front of me. I knew when I woke up it would be dark, and it would be time for my next shift, but for now, I just drove, dreaming about the ocean and watching the sun come up, like it always does, despite everything",3,1757963410.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1nhuyk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nhuyk1/am_i_wrong_for_leaving_my_roommate_with_only_two/,Am I wrong for leaving my roommate with only two weeks notice?,"Hi Reddit. I'm using a throwaway account for this, as I really don't want to be traced back to this somehow.



I (29M) recently moved to a new state for work, medical sales. I travel a lot, so I wanted a quiet place to stay when I‚Äôm in town. Found a room for rent, met the current tenant (late 20s F). We did a ‚Äúcoffee interview‚Äù at Starbucks. I ordered a steamed apple cider (don‚Äôt judge me, I like warm drinks). She initially seemed a little standoffish, but in today's climate, I get it. Things are a little weird especially given i'm a random man moving in with a woman.



I paid my deposit early, asked politely if it was okay for my girlfriend to help me move in and spend the night (since she had a long drive back), and even contributed to the pantry. I labeled my food and supplies so there wouldn‚Äôt be confusion, and even marked some things as communal. 



My girlfriend (27F) came with me on move-in day, introduced herself with a smile, and got me a little move-in gift metal straws. She literally said, ‚ÄúCongrats on your new place! Thought these might come in handy.‚Äù It was wholesome. My roommate made this weird face, like that was something cringey or awkward. This should have been my first red flag.



Here‚Äôs where things got weird:



My roommate decided she didn‚Äôt ‚Äútrust‚Äù me. She started playing loud music at night as if she was trying to get a reaction out of me; ‚Äù I didn‚Äôt, I just installed soundproofing on my door and walls so we could both have peace.



A few days later, I noticed someone had been in my room while I was gone. One of my model kit boxes was tossed on the bed and my drawers were clearly rummaged through.



When I asked, she admitted she used her spare key to go through my room because she ‚Äúhad a feeling I was hiding something‚Äù and needed to ‚Äúsee what kind of person‚Äù I was.



For context, my room has:



A signed KISS vinyl (gift from my late dad)



An old NASCAR poster



Some Gundam model kits, a couple unfinished



She told me this ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù I was hiding something. I told her that was a huge invasion of privacy and gave her two weeks‚Äô notice. She freaked out, saying I was ‚Äúrunning away‚Äù and overreacting. Keep in mind her reasoning for this is: My drink order was weird, apparently my snack choices are weird (Muddy Buddies, and Nacho cheese bugles and fruit snacks), Labeling my stuff is weird, and apparently my girlfriend is ""too nice""



I couldn't deal with it. I hadn't even been there two months, and it just felt like she was gonna keep upping the ante. So I gave her two weeks' notice. She did NOT take it well. Almost immediately, she became passive-aggressive, demanded to know where I was going, how I could do this, claiming I was running away, things like that, and eventually, I got tired of asking her, so I told her.



My Girlfriends parents were offering me to move in with them from the jump, but this is a new state, and I did not want to appear like I was gonna just take advantage, or be imposing on them at my first meeting. I do feel guilty, because I know how hard this economy can get, but I feel like I'm going insane. These are NORMAL things for me, and I don't think I've done anything too eccentric.

1nhuuiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/1nhuuiu/looking_for_odd_jobs/,Looking for odd jobs!,"Good afternoon Reddit! Don't hesitate to delete if not allowd!

I am looking for odd jobs to make some extra cash before the end of the month! And maybe even into next month.

Why do I need extra cash?
I understand I may get this question. The truth is my roomate can't pay rent, so I have to take it over. Even with a full time job, that's hard.

What is my availability?
I'm available anytime outside of my full time job. I work Wednesdays through Saturdays from 7:15am to 5:45pm. So, I'm free all day Sundays through Tuesdays.  I also have a doctor's appointment on the 23rd at 8:30 am. I do have a weird scedule at the end of the month/ beginning of next. I don't work the 17th, do work the 28th, and don't work the 4th.

What can I do?
I enjoy cleaning, photography, and animals. I can also help people move, with limitations. Need to put a coffee table together, but don't want to? I can help! I love assembling things. Any odd job I can do, I'll try my hardest! 

Qualifications?
I have worked with animals for around 6 years, and still do. Everything from bathing to mild training to just picking up after them. I have walked dogs as big as Irish Wolfhounds and as small as Yorkies. I have 1 disabled cat as my own and 2 other cats that I live with. Other than that, I just love cleaning and taking pictures with my phone. No qualifications with that, just passion. I got though most of Rover's sign up, until it asked for $50. 

What I can't do.
I can't watch your animal at my place, as I will not stress my cat out (he has health issues) and also, more importantly, I live in an apartment. I can't lift over 20lbs as I have a ticking time bomb in my spinal cord. Other than that, I'm here to help!

Thanks if you read all this! And thanks SO much if you can help out! Or better yet, I can help YOU.  ",14,1757962990.0,ColoradoSprings,0,0.94,False
1nhuui9,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorwriters/comments/1nhuui9/the_city_that_forgot_to_eat/,The city that forgot to EAT,"Morning in the city is a ritual. The trams rattle in on schedule, doors yawning open for commuters who no longer bother with coffee. Storefronts glow, their clerks arranging goods no one buys. People walk, speak, clock in, laugh at jokes. But they never eat. Not a sandwich, not a sip of water. The whole city hums with the shape of normal life, hollowed out.

I walk among them with my wife‚Äôs hand in mine, pretending like everyone else. We nod to neighbors, answer questions, even browse shelves we‚Äôll never pay for. It is the only way to survive: wear the daylight mask.

But when the shadows lengthen, the mask slips.

That evening, as the sun drained behind the skyline, we passed the old bakery. A boy stood there Jiro, the baker‚Äôs son. I remembered him chasing pigeons, cheeks dusted in flour, too shy to meet my eye. He smiled at me now, the way children do when they recognize someone safe.

And then the darkness touched him.

His jaw clenched, bones straining as if they were trying to crawl out of his skin. Fingers curled backward, nails blackening. His pupils fogged to white, and his smile curdled into something sharp. The sound he made wasn‚Äôt human, it was a hiss dragging across broken glass.

Night had claimed him.

The street froze. We all knew what came next. Jiro lifted his head, nostrils flaring, ears twitching to the scrape of shoes, the whisper of breath. Blind, but hunting.

My wife squeezed my hand once. Don‚Äôt move. Don‚Äôt breathe.

The city belonged to them now.

1nhut0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadByDaylightRAGE/comments/1nhut0o/huge_rant_the_fucking_community_contest/,HUGE RANT : The fucking community contest,"Yes in know this is a game, you are supposed to have fun, the majority decides, all tastes and opinions are subjective, bla bla bla. Now that's out of the way ; OH MY FUCKING GOD EVERYTHING SUCKS 

And i'm not just talking about the winners, among ALL of the qualified in all categories, we have 1/3 that is bland uninspired stuff, 1/3 that is bland goofy stuff, and 1/3 that is alright. But of course people like trash so they'll rather pick something just because it's on a character they play rather than because it is actually good OBVIOUSLY.

I'll detail precisely what i hate and why i hate it just after a short precision ; i don't blame the artists even if i think their submissions are mediocre, they only did their best and if they managed to get this far then that proves it was good (or at least good enough for the devs) so congrats to them. 
The real culprit here is BHVR themselves, because yeah i get that designing new skins is hard, but this year it was fucking OBVIOUS that you picked skins not based on merits or actual good designs but simply on how easy it would be to replicate by reusing assets. Nearly all of the survivor's skins look like recolors with a new motif and color someone barfed on it... Also, next year try not to pick multiple submissions from the same artist, it feels a little forced.

Now, onto me raging at the different cat√©gories :

- badges. The main reason why i made this post.

To be fair, they got a few good ideas in there, especially the one with the crow's eyes are especially in my opinion, this was also the ONLY SERIOUS ONE by the way. But of course they didn't win, because ""horror elements in my horror game ? ""No thank you"" said the majority of this community.
What if we picked a fucking racoon that might as well have been just another cat (it's only there for the ""awwww""), a reference to a meme (haha funny dog haha), a closeup of the Artist (nothing to say about that one, it's alright) and Maurice drinking a coffee... Out of all of these, there is ONE that has something close to an idea, all the rest are just goofy and feel out of place but then again, that's what the community wants so who am i to judge. Won't stop me from complaining though. 

The ""Always watching"" looked absolutely fantastic with great color scheme, felt grounded in the game with the Entity spying everywhere through them, and had a somewhat creepy vibe. I started my rant here as soon as i saw that it lost to... let me check my notes... oh yeah ; AFUCKING BASIC RACOON, A FUCKING MEME, AND MAURICE (i like him but that one sucked as well)

- banners.

This one was fine. Most of these have either reference to the game or feel creepy, i like the winners as well. There was only one that i despised and it was the cat one, which OBVIOUSLY won because as long as you put a cute animal then you've basically stolen all the votes from pet owners that all act like the fucking Brad Pitt pointing meme. Very mad the slug race didn't make it

- killers.

Jester wraith is excellent, Legion is alright, Knight is not too bad but feels mediocre compared to the one we had last year which makes the fact that this one won sting even more, and the Deathslinger's feels uninspired as can be. Twins was amazing but lost probably due to the lack of players, same for Trickster, and Wraith was great as well but got shafted. Nurse was alright but felt pale in comparison of the ""astronaut"" nurse we had here on reddit. The Hillbilly's and Houndmaster skin were bad imo.

- and now, the cream of the garbage, the survivors skins.

This is where the trash peaked, everyone that payed just a little attention to the community posts knew that the choices were absolutely made out of self interest by the devs.

 EVERYTHING looked similar to a skin that already exists, EVERYTHING had the same vibe as all of the other character's skin, and EVERYTHING was cartoonishly bland. Literally a copy paste.

=> Taurie is a cultist, we could give her something religious-like but NO, let's give her  Nea's outfit (litterally).
=> Orela is a medic, we could give her something related to that but NO, let's give her a yet another punk outfit. Look it has a little health symbol on it so that obviously means it's a perfect reference to her character.
=> Vittorio is a time traveller and could get something related to the past but NO, let's give him another tight jean and an open shirt because that's what people want in a horror game : chests and asses

Anyway you should get my point by now ; litterally all of these feel like they have been reused, from the design to the very basis of their conception and lore. There is so much potential, the community contest is the ONE time when anything might be possible and when we can dream about all kinds of interesting ideas and instead we get this slop. 
Every. Single. One. of these could have been released on a normal banner and no one would have noticed, literally no one.

There is only one that i liked, the Kate skin, and that's mostly because it was the only one bringing something fresh to the table, and because of the guitar-spear. Remove that and you've got a good looking skin but with the same problem as all the others


So yeah, very frustrated that out of everything we could have had, we got stuff that felr like it came straight from the devs alt accounts (and that's not a compliment). I know i'm harsh and if those skins managed to win there must be people that appreciate them, but fuck, they all feel the same. I just wish we could have more horror and less ""Wish"" customization...

Rant over, but i'll keep being mad at this. I'm willing to detail my hate for any skin if asked so feel free to ask, or tell me i'm an idiot and that you disagree with me that works too.

Ive found some good references of cost of living in fukuoka but I am not sure if I can trust the sources or not, so I decided to ask here. Sorry if I am breaking any rules or so.  
  
I‚Äôm considering a move to Fukuoka for work and I‚Äôd like some perspective on whether the salary I‚Äôve been offered (10.5M yen gross per year) would allow me and my wife to maintain a lifestyle similar to what we currently have in my home town (Im the only one receiving some income in my house).

Here‚Äôs what our life looks like now:

* We live in a modern 2LDK apartment (70m¬≤+) in a nice neighborhood, close to the beach.
* We own a comfortable SUV (not luxury, but something spaceous and reliable).
* We eat out 3‚Äì4 times a week (including weekends), go to coffee shops regularly, and some times buy some clothes (once a month or once every two months I get a new shirt and she gets something nice to her)
* Also we try to save around 900 euros monthly (sometimes we save less, like 400 or 300 in case we need to buy something more expensive or if we want to travel \[we may end up not saving anything if the reason is traveling\])

  
Also, is this salary range provided fair? It is considerably lower than what I am currently receiving, but I am totally aware that its a different life with a different cost of living. So if I can keep a similar life style I am totally fine with it.

I have Hyperemesis Gravidarum which is extreme morning sickness, low blood pressure and I see black spots randomly and nearly pass out sometimes, it has not been easy. 
I dated my ex, C, in high school and a little bit of college but he moved away for a while and we broke up on good terms. He is a sweet guy. When I met L I found out that him and C were friends. So eventually we all started hanging out together and it was never an issue that he‚Äôs my ex. The town we live in is small and you can walk everywhere.

This time C was also there, he bought me food and we talked for awhile and then got the drinks to go. He said I should swing by his apartment because he has a gift for the baby and he has to walk his dog, Luke. 
   So we get to the apartment and the present was a onesie with L‚Äôs favorite sports team on it.

  He let me back into the apartment. Threw a towel and tshirt into the bathroom and went back outside to finish Luke‚Äôs walk. Once I got dressed and cleaned up  he drove me home. I went to sleep as soon as I got home. 
When L came home I told him about my day, leaving no details out and he was surprisingly furious. He said it was disrespectful to shower at another man‚Äôs house especially an ex.

I recently had a rough breakup, and I am still considering making another post to ask for your opinion on other things that happened during it. But for now, I'll start with one question that still lingers in my mind:



But let's start at the beginning:

I never thought I'd be ok with a long distance relationship, but with my now ex-girlfriend, it just felt so right. Because of that, I was ok with us going for it.

However, just some time ago, she started to get less and less energetic. It felt less and less like she was enjoying our time together.

During that time, she briefly mentioned that she still had to say no to a guy that wanted to get to know her. I didn't think much of it at that time, but, as you can see in the title, it will become important later.

Whenever I asked if there was anything wrong, she just said that there was nothing specific, she was just not feeling well in general. 

Then, after some time of it feeling like having less and less motivation to do things together, she went out with friends for around a day and had a sleepover, so we didn't speak.

The next day, we only talked for a short time, with her saying that she is not feeling great. The day after, she wanted to only have little contact through text and not talk at all. This went on for another 2 days, making it 3 in total where we did pretty much nothing together. On the third day however, I asked her to have a short call with me, where I inquired once again if anything was wrong and told her that she doesn't have to worry about telling me about problems. There she said that she feels like she is having a depressive episode, but that she doesn't know why, as she always only knows the reason when it is over. After telling me that, she wanted to get out of the call as soon as possible.

I tried to give her more space again following that. On the next day however, I received a text from her saying that she wanted to talk.

During that talk, she opened up about the fact that long distance doesn't work for her after all, that the lack of touch makes her feel unloved, even though her mind knows it's not how it is, and asked if we could stay friends.

I, of course, wanted to first work on things first. She never told me about how badly this affected her, or about any other problems. Though she got worse and worse and at the end just wanted out of the call, stop the relationship and don't work on anything or find solutions together.

Because of the time pressure I felt, I switched from trying to find solutions to general questions, feeling like I couldn't solve anything with all the pressure at that time.

One of the earlier questions was, in typical ""doesn't want to fully realize"" fashion, if she was willing to stay ""friends"", but with the added condition of not seeking out other partners. - Which was met with an immediate no from her.

During my questions round, I then finally got to the question if she went ahead and met with the guy she mentioned. Now it seems way worse for me, but back then, the question wasn't really about cheating. For me, this was about getting to know how far she was done with the relationship in the end. I wanted to know if she maybe had the breakup in mind for longer considering her lack of enthusiasm and then went to meet the guy to test if she wanted and was ready for a new relationship - one not long distance, a regular one, one in real life. And when that was something that felt was right, she needed to finally find the strength to tell me before she does anything really bad.

So when she answered with ""nope"", that question was over for me. It wasn't about trust, but, as mentioned above, a ""How far gone are you"" question. Or a ""You could've told me earlier.""

However, she really focused on that, said that she never expected something like that from me, that she can't be with someone who doesn't even have a basic level of trust in her and now sees me entirely different. She proceeded to attach screenshots of their conversation (which I didn't need, as this whole thing was over after the nope for me) and then proceeded block me on the messenger we usually used.



As mentioned above, I think I'll make another post in the future asking about some other things that happened after this, but I think that in the end, this was the nail in the coffin and she never got back to even wanting to see me after.

For this part of the story, I want to know whether I did something outrageous? It didn't feel that way at the time, but since then I feel like I asked something horrible.

Edit: The only other info I have on this is that she, during the time I tried to fix things, mentioned that I had said that she would maybe ""like to see how it feels in real life"" and that for her, this is cheating and that I said something unforgivable. For me, it just meant to portray that she would maybe like to experience a relationship with someone who can be close by, with whom she can cuddle or go for a walk, just like she mentioned before.

Though it seems important enough for her to mention, so I'll include it here, as I try to give you the most objective view as possible. Nonetheless, I know that with only having my side of the story, I guess that is hard to do.",1,1757962300.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

1nhui8h,https://i.redd.it/rwfdxrj2jdpf1.png,[Rum Review #178] Foursquare Sovereignty ECS XIX,"On November 30, 2021, Barbados bid farewell to the British monarchy and became a republic. Just 396 years after an English ship claimed the small archipelago for the King of England in 1625, the British monarchy reigned over the small Caribbean republic. In 2021, a handover ceremony marked the birth of the world's youngest republic and the end of Queen Elizabeth II's term as the island's head of state.

This release in Foursquare's Exceptional Cask Selections series takes place in November 2021 and owes its name, Sovereignty, to this event.

Sovereignty is a blend of pot still and column still rums aged in Barbados for a total of 14 years. Part of the rum in the blend was aged for 14 years in ex-bourbon casks, and another part was aged for three years in ex-bourbon casks and then transferred to ex-Oloroso sherry casks for an additional 11 years. One of the points the brand regularly mentions is that all of this aging takes place at the distillery in Barbados, which I would assume is true, but the brand proudly states it. Even more proudly, they say it has no coloring, no sugar, no chill filtration, and no additives. The blend is finally bottled at 62% ABV.

Made by: Foursquare Distillery  
Name of the rum: Exceptional Cask Series XIX Sovereignty  
Brand: Foursquare  
Origin: Barbados  
Age: 14 years

**Nose:** There are a multitude of red fruit aromas, including blackberry, raspberry, and cherry. There are also notes of hazelnuts and almonds, leather, and dark chocolate at the end.

**Palate:** The alcohol kick is very noticeable on the palate, but it's equally fruity, with notes of red fruits, although less easily differentiated, perhaps precisely because of that truly aggressive alcohol punch. There are also notes of chocolate, and curiously, there's a distinct coffee note.

**Retrohale/Finish:** More dark chocolate, tangerine peel and a long finish.

**Rating:** 9 on the t8ke

**Conclusion:** I'm impressed with this rum, as it stands out and displays a notable number of flavors associated with sherry casks, but they aren't the strongest flavors. Although it's a fruity rum with the typical flavors of rums from ex-sherry casks and aged for 11 years, as expected, it lacks the sweet notes that also characterize these rums. Instead, the expressions are of chocolate, coffee, and light spices, which are a big difference from many of the products in the Exceptional Cask series.

If you're not interested in something, you probably won't be able to commit to it long-term, at least, I couldn‚Äôt. So I experimented.

Role Searching: I initially searched on Indeed and LinkedIn, but found limited and expired options for internship. I switched to¬†**Spotly.job**s's job board, it updates jobs in minutes, and¬†**Handshake**, where I got my first internship in college there, and several of my alumni did too.

Interview prep: I used¬†**AMA Interview**¬†to predict likely questions based on job roles and my resume, and asked ChatGPT for example answers, but I rewrote and personalized every single one. I also read through¬†**Glassdoor**¬†after-interview reviews from past candidates. For general prep, I created an answer bank for phone screens and behavioral questions. For specific roles, I expanded on this outline with more targeted content. After building my own cheatsheet of interview stories, I started enjoying the interview process. The key was to practice over and over, not just writing it, but speaking it out loud until it became natural.

**Step 3: Move Toward Your Ideal Role with Targeted Projects**  
Through my own job search, and countless coffee chats with seniors and hiring managers, this advice stood out: your major or school title doesn‚Äôt matter as much as your relevant experience does, unless you're applying to companies that strictly recruit from target schools. Even if you graduate from Wharton with a finance major, it doesn‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôll get a data scientist role if you have no related projects. That‚Äôs why my first internship and my full-time job were both unrelated to my undergraduate major. I built my knowledge base through school projects tied to the industry I wanted to enter. I also identified online courses (like those on¬†**Coursera,¬†Udemy**) that matched job requirements, and treated them like my own unofficial minor.

If you‚Äôre just starting out, don‚Äôt feel discouraged if you‚Äôre lost. everyone was too. But once you have got the right system in place, defining your direction, building relevant experience, and preparing with intention, everything starts to click.",1,1757962128.0,womenintech,1,1.0,False
1nhuexc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nhuexc,Pokemon Fire Red Nuzlocke,"After recently reading a nuzlocke comics (It‚Äôs a hard life for those wondering. It‚Äôs pretty bleak, though, just a heads up if you wanna check it out), my motivation to do nuzlockes has been revived and I wanted to sort of catalogue a Fire Red run I‚Äôm gonna be doing. Might do it for other regions as well, who knows?

Rules:

1. Standard stuff like nicknaming, one mon per area, if a mon faints, it‚Äôs considered dead and can‚Äôt be used anymore (except maybe for HMs)

2. Dupes clause: I spun a wheel to decided whether I‚Äôd go with dupes clause for this run or not and it landed on dupes clause. If I go into n a new area and the first pokemon I find is one of the same species or evolution line as one I already have, I gotta skip it and try to find something new in that area. The only exceptions here I‚Äôll make are pokemon that have branched evolution lines.

3. Shiny clause: Unless a shiny ends up being the first mon of a new area, if a shiny is encountered in an area, it doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôve already caught a pokemon in that area or if it‚Äôs a species I already have, I‚Äôm catching it. 

4. Setting battle style to set.

5. No healing items or any other items in battle unless it‚Äôs to use pokeballs for catching pokemon.

6. This is more of a heads up. I modified my game to make impossible evolutions possible and also put full HM compatibility on the off chance I have no mons that can use certain HMs. Sort of a safety measure in that sense.

7. This is gonna be a bit divisive, but blacking out and whiting out won‚Äôt be the end of the run. If I lose my team and I have any live pokemon in my PC, I can continue the run. If every single live pokemon I have is dead, then it really is Game Over. I know this goes against the usual rule, but I think it‚Äôll be fun and a way to give other pokemon a chance if things go south during the run. If you disagree with it, that‚Äôs fine. This is just how I‚Äôm doing my run. This is the first time I‚Äôm doing a rule like this, so whether I‚Äôll keep a rule like this for future runs or not is uncertain. I wanna give it a shot at least. Now. Let‚Äôs get this started.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

So, I pick a boy character and name him ‚ÄúKey‚Äù (based on my username) and I name my rival ‚ÄúLock‚Äù as a neat contrast. I go through the usual motions like getting the potion from the home PC, going towards the tall grass, being stopped by Professor Oak and being led to his lab to get a starter pokemon to protect myself from the pokemon in the tall grass. I‚Äôm allowed to pick first while Lock has to wait his turn and I decide to spin a wheel to decide. The wheel lands on Bulbasaur, so I pick that little fella, meaning Lock gets Charmander as a counter to that. I name my Bulbasaur ‚ÄúCaesar‚Äù as in Caesar salad.

After Lock already starts saying his starter‚Äôs tougher than mine, he challenges me to a battle. Thankfully, since neither of our starters have any same type moves starting out, Caesar pretty much just takes Lock‚Äôs Charmander down by weakening the lizard‚Äôs attack with some growls and then just spamming tackle. Overall? Pretty simple fight since it‚Äôs the first rival battle. Lock basically says he picked the wrong Pok√©mon, Caesar levels up and then Lock heads out to toughen up his Pok√©mon.

After that‚Äôs done, I pretty much head out of the lab and Pallet Town and into Route 1, meeting a guy who works at a Pok√©mon Mart and I get a free potion from him. Pretty nice since it‚Äôll save me some money and, even if I can‚Äôt use items in battle, keeping my mons healed before and after fights will probably save my ass plenty of times. I get through Route 1, giving Caesar a bit of training on the way via a wild encounter or two and then make it to Viridian City, which had two paths beyond it. One leads to Route 2 and the other leads to Route 22, the former being blocked by an old guy who hasn‚Äôt had his coffee yet (and apparently was drunk in the Japanese version of these games). I find a potion in Viridian behind a tree and then head to the nearby mart.

The second I go into the mart, the clerk tasks me to deliver a parcel for Oak and doesn‚Äôt really sell me anything until I do that. Bit of a weird thing for him to do, but it is what it is. I head back through Route 1, doing some more wild encounters on the way and getting Bulbasaur to level 7 in the process. I get back to Pallet Town and bring the parcel to Oak, who notes that Caesar is already growing attached to me. Glad to know we‚Äôre already fast friends! üëç Anyway, Lock arrives at the lab since Oak called him so that he could give both Lock and I each a Pok√©Dex and some pok√© balls. Lock already gets cocky and says he‚Äôll borrow a map from his sis, Daisy and tell her not to lend me one. Either Lock was bluffing or his sister just didn‚Äôt like him being a jerk, because she pretty much gave me a map after I went to their house.

Well, with the run now officially starting now that I have some pok√© balls, it was time to see what route 1 had to offer. My encounter in Route 1 was a male Rattata, which I successfully caught and named ‚ÄúJerry‚Äù. I think most of you guys can guess why. He had the Guts ability which is honestly pretty solid for a physical attacker like him. Sure, will having status conditions suck to have? Yeah, they usually suck to have, but having a boost in attack as compensation is very nice to have, especially if it‚Äôs burn since the attack decrease from burn basically gets negated in the process.

I meet the old man again once I get back to Viridian City and he teaches me how to catch a Pok√©mon‚Ä¶after I already caught one. Kinda makes me wish we just had the option to skip catching tutorials. Well, after that, I take a brief trip to Route 2 and Viridian Forest respectively to get some team members. On Route 2, I encounters and caught a male Weedle, which reminded me I should stock up on supplies since, while I now have to mons that are part poison type, that‚Äôs not gonna be the case for ever mon I get, especially since Jerry isn‚Äôt a poison type. I named the little fella ‚ÄúSimon‚Äù. Simon has the Shield Dust ability, which prevents the added effects of attacks, so stuff like flinch from Bite or stuff like that doesn‚Äôt get factored when he‚Äôs hit. Neat ability.

I find an antidote and potion in Viridian Forest and, after a while of Weedle and Kakuna encounters, which Caesar deals with and gets up to level 9 through those battles, we encounter a female Caterpie. While neither of these early route bugs are super strong in the long run, I have a soft spot for these fellas and their evolutions. The best I can do is try to keep them alive and hope I can make the best out of their strengths. I named her ‚ÄúHappy‚Äù and see that she also has Shield Dust. In fact, both Happy and Simon not only have the same ability, but also the same nature. While Inyjink Simon the the worst off with it due to that nature lowering speed for special attack, Happy might make some use out of it since special attack will be her bread and butter when she fully evolves. Granted, the lower speed will kinda be a bad thing depending on what she goes up against in the future.

Well, after all of that, I decide to go back to Viridian to stick up on items and heal every body up at the Pok√©mon Center. I decide to head west afterward towards Route 22. Obviously, since that route leads to the Pok√©mon League where the toughest of Kanto‚Äôs trainers are gonna be at, I‚Äôm not gonna be allowed past that route unless he got all the Gym badges, so I just take the time to catch a new member (Sustar the female Spearow, hardy nature) and train up my team so they can get caught up to Caesar, getting them all up to level 9. Simon and Happy evolve into their middle stages, Kakuna and Metapod, respectively during the training, which have them the move, Harden. 

Unfortunately, I run into Lock on Route 22, wanting to see if my Pok√©mon got stronger. I sent out Jerry against Lock‚Äôs Pidgey, but, once the bird landed some sand attacks, Jerry‚Äôs quick attacks weren‚Äôt hitting past the first one and he was taking some decent damage from Pidgey. Pidgey didn‚Äôt send to have any flying type moves at its current level, so I switched into Simon and used a few poison stings, managing to poison it before switching into Caesar to leech seed it and get some health back from some of it‚Äôs attacks after switching out. Then Lock‚Äôs Charmander came in. Caesar leech seeded it before switching into Sustar, using some pecks mixed with leech seed‚Äôs healing to take the lizard down. I won and Lock got salty, saying I lucked out. Not my fault he only brought two pokemon. Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt make Charmander use Ember when I had Bulbasaur going against it briefly. Would‚Äôve been the perfect time for him to use it. Oh well, sucks for him.

I pretty much went all the way back to Viridian Forest, fighting my way through bug catchers and finding a potion and an antidote along the way. Jerry did get poisoned during one battle, but I had several antidotes in my bag, so I just cured him once the battle was over. I eventually made it to Pewter City. I healed my team in the Pok√©mon Center, talked to some of the folks there like the kids trading each other‚Äôs mons, a guy on the phone talking about Team Rocket being on Mt. Moon and a guy with a singing Jigglypuff that‚Äôs making him drowsy. Hopefully that guy won‚Äôt wake up with marker all over his face. I went to a Mart to get a few more items before checking out Pewter City‚Äôs museum. In there, there were Aerodactyl and Kabutops bones on display as well as a meteorite that fell on Mt. Moon, apparently being thought to be a moon stone. Considering a certain species that evolves with that stone is said to be from space or something like that, it might well be. Who knows? I also saw a space shuttle in there. Apparently, they were running a space exhibit.

Well, with that said and done, I pretty much trained on the other end of Route 2 and in Viridian Forest to train my team up to level 14. I needed to train them in preparation for Brock since that gym‚Äôs specialty was the rock type. Of course, as you‚Äôd expect, both Happy and Simon evolved into a Butterfree and Beedrill respectively. That‚Äôs pretty much the nature of these kinds of bug types. They evolve early and can prove strong early on, but fall off later on. Still, it doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt find any use for them later on. After all, I gotta make use of every team member I get. You never know when one of them can save the run, right? Well, with training done, I headed to the gym.

There was only one gym trainer before the actual gym leader. Granted, in that battle against said trainer, I forgot that I had Jerry at the front of the party at the time, so I had to switch out to Caesar. Didn‚Äôt really amount to anything bad, thankfully. Plus, Caesar was gonna be the main contributor to the Brock fight. Most of the team was either weak to or had moved that were resisted by the rock typing, so Caesar was the best choice. The next best was Happy if Caesar somehow got killed since she at least had confusion to do special damage instead of physical damage. Rock mons aren‚Äôt usually known for being specially defensive, after all.

I challenged Brock and he pretty much talked about his ‚Äúrock hard willpower‚Äù (yes, there‚Äôs a joke you can make in there. Shut up) and his Pok√©mon‚Äôs  determination. The guy was arrogant to say the least, saying ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to challenge me, knowing that you‚Äôll lose‚Äù. So, I think you know where that led him. Caesar was the first to come out against Brock‚Äôs Geodude. Caesar made quick work of Geodude with a single vine whip and even leveled up, learning poison and sleep powder. While could have just put the Onix that came into the battle immediately after, there wasn‚Äôt really a need to. Since both of Brock‚Äôs team members being rock and ground types, both being weak to grass, it pretty much made Onix as much of a cake walk as Geodude was. After winning the fight, Brock made the suggestion that I head to the gym in Cerulean City and test my team‚Äôs might there.

Well, with the next major step decided, I went out of the gym and headed to the center to heal up. No deaths so far, but that could easily change in due time if I‚Äôm not careful. At the very least, Ima enjoy my team being deathless for as long as I can.

**Benefits of Composting With Chickens**

Composting with chickens offers a multitude of benefits that can greatly enhance both your garden and the well-being of your feathery friends. One of the key benefits is the contribution of chicken manure to the compost. Chicken manure is rich in nitrogen, which is an essential nutrient for plant growth. When added to the compost pile, it helps create a nutrient-rich environment that's perfect for your plants. This nutrient boost will result in healthier and more vibrant plants, providing you with a garden full of beautiful flowers or bountiful vegetables.

Not only does composting with chickens benefit your garden, but it also provides a cheap and nutritious food source for your feathered companions. Chickens naturally love to forage and scratch around in the compost pile, searching for tasty insects and bits of food. By allowing them access to the compost, you aren't only providing them with a natural and varied diet, but also reducing their feed expenses. It's a win-win situation for both you and your chickens!

In addition to these benefits, composting with chickens helps reduce waste and produces high-quality compost, often referred to as 'garden gold.' The chickens' scratching and pecking behavior helps turn and aerate the compost pile, accelerating the decomposition process. Their constant movement helps break down the organic matter, resulting in a faster breakdown of materials and a more efficient composting process. This means that you can enjoy rich, dark compost for your garden in a shorter amount of time.

**Choosing the Right Location for Composting**

To ensure successful composting, it's crucial to carefully select the right location for your compost pile. Here are some important factors to consider when choosing the perfect spot:

**Good drainage**: Select an area with good drainage to prevent waterlogging of the compost pile. Excessive moisture can hinder the decomposition process and create an unpleasant smell. A well-drained area will allow excess water to drain away, keeping your compost pile healthy and odor-free.

**Partial sunlight**: Choose a spot that receives partial sunlight to help maintain an optimal temperature for decomposition. Sunlight helps to warm up the compost pile, speeding up the breakdown of organic materials. However, too much direct sunlight can dry out the pile, so a balance is key.

**Odor control**: Avoid placing the compost pile too close to your house or areas where strong odors could be an issue. While composting chicken manure and other materials can create a natural smell, proper placement can help mitigate any potential odor issues. Keeping the compost pile at a reasonable distance from your living areas will ensure a more pleasant environment.

In addition to these considerations, it's also important to think about accessibility for regular turning and maintenance of the compost pile. You'll want to be able to easily access the pile to turn it regularly and mix the contents. This helps to aerate the compost and speed up the decomposition process.

Lastly, keep the compost pile away from trees or shrubs to prevent roots from invading the compost. Tree roots can disrupt the composting process and compete with the pile for nutrients. By keeping your compost pile away from trees and shrubs, you can ensure that your compost is solely dedicated to enriching your garden soil.

**Gathering Materials for Your Composting System**

When preparing to gather materials for your composting system, it's important to consider the specific ingredients that will contribute to the success of your compost pile. Composting with chickens provides a unique opportunity to utilize their manure, along with other organic materials, to create nutrient-rich compost for your garden.

To start your compost pile, gather both brown and green materials. Brown materials include wood shavings, straw, and dried leaves. These materials provide carbon, which helps to balance the nitrogen-rich chicken manure. Green materials, on the other hand, include chicken manure, kitchen and garden scraps, and fresh grass clippings. These materials are high in nitrogen and will speed up the decomposition process.

Once you have gathered your materials, it's time to start building your compost pile. Layer the brown and green materials, making sure to alternate between the two. This will create a well-balanced compost pile. Remember to avoid adding any meat or dairy products, as they can attract pests and slow down the decomposition process.

Regularly turning your compost pile is crucial to introducing oxygen and speeding up the decomposition process. This can be easily done with a pitchfork or compost turning tool. By turning the pile every few weeks, you'll ensure that all the materials are breaking down evenly and efficiently.

Monitoring the moisture level of your compost pile is also important. It should feel like a damp sponge, not too dry or too wet. If it's too dry, add water to moisten it. If it's too wet, add more brown materials to absorb the excess moisture.

**Understanding the Green/Brown Ratio for Composting**

Achieving the perfect balance between green and brown materials is essential for successful composting in your composting system. Understanding the green/brown ratio is crucial to ensure that your composting with chickens is effective in turning waste into garden gold. Here are three key points to help you grasp the importance of the green/brown ratio:

**The ideal ratio**: For optimal results, aim for a green/brown ratio of 2 parts brown material to 1 part green material. Green materials, such as chicken manure, provide nitrogen, while brown materials, like wood shavings and dried leaves, provide carbon. This balanced ratio creates a nutrient-rich environment for the composting process.

**Proper decomposition**: Maintaining the correct green/brown ratio ensures proper decomposition and prevents the compost pile from becoming too smelly. If your compost starts emitting a foul odor, it's a sign that the green-to-brown material ratio needs adjustment. Adding more brown material can help restore the balance and eliminate unpleasant smells.

Beneficial microbes and faster composting: A balanced green/brown ratio promotes the growth of beneficial microbes, which are essential for breaking down organic matter. These microorganisms thrive in an environment with the right balance of nitrogen and carbon. When the green/brown ratio is in harmony, the composting process accelerates, resulting in nutrient-rich compost for your garden.

Understanding and maintaining the green/brown ratio in your composting system is the key to transforming waste into valuable garden gold. By following the recommended ratio and adjusting as needed, you can create a thriving compost pile that supports the growth of plants and contributes to a healthier ecosystem.

**How Long Does Chicken Manure Take to Compost?**

Composting chicken manure can take anywhere from 45-60 days when using the hot composting method. This method involves maintaining a high internal temperature of 140-160¬∞F for at least three consecutive days to accelerate the decomposition process. The heat generated during hot composting helps break down the organic matter in the manure more quickly, resulting in a rich and nutrient-dense compost for your garden.

If you prefer a slower composting process, you can opt for cold composting. This method allows chicken manure to naturally decompose over a period of 6-12 months. Cold composting doesn't require the same level of temperature control as hot composting, but it still requires a proper balance of carbon-based brown materials (such as straw or leaves) and nitrogen-based green materials (like chicken manure) to expedite the decomposition process.

To speed up the composting of chicken manure, it's important to regularly turn the compost pile. This helps introduce oxygen and ensures that the composting materials are evenly mixed. It's also essential to monitor the moisture level of the compost pile. Chicken manure contains a high amount of nitrogen, which can result in a wet compost pile. Adding dry brown materials like straw or shredded paper can help absorb excess moisture and promote faster decomposition.

**Using Chicken Manure Compost in the Garden**

To optimize the benefits of chicken manure compost in your garden, consider incorporating it as a nutrient-rich layer or creating chicken manure tea for a natural boost to your plants.

Chicken manure compost is like garden gold, packed with essential nutrients that can transform your plants into thriving, lush beauties.

Here are three ways you can use chicken manure compost in your garden:

1. **Apply a layer of chicken manure compost**: Spread a 1-2 inch layer of compost over your garden beds annually. This won't only enrich the soil with nutrients like calcium, sulfur, magnesium, nitrogen, and potassium but also improve soil structure. The compost enhances water retention, soil drainage, and aeration, creating an ideal environment for your plants to grow strong and healthy.
2. **Feed your plants with chicken manure tea**: Create a nutrient-rich tea by steeping chicken manure compost in water. Strain the liquid and use it to water your plants. This chicken manure tea releases the nutrients from the compost, making them readily available to your plants. It's a natural and effective way to give your garden an extra boost.
3. **Focus on nitrogen-loving plants**: Chicken manure compost is particularly beneficial for nitrogen-loving plants like tomatoes, peppers, leafy greens, cucumbers, and squash. These plants thrive when they receive an adequate supply of nitrogen, and chicken manure compost provides just that. By incorporating this compost into your garden, you'll enhance the growth and yield of these plants, giving you a bountiful harvest.

**Using Chicken Manure Compost in Pots**

If you're looking to maximize the benefits of chicken manure compost in your garden, why not try using it in your potted plants as well? Using chicken manure compost in pots can be a great way to enrich the soil and provide essential nutrients to your plants.

To use chicken manure compost in pots, it's important to mix it into your favorite potting soil, making sure that it doesn't compose more than 50% of the soil mixture. This will ensure that your plants receive a balanced amount of nutrients without overwhelming them.

Another way to use chicken manure compost in pots is to apply it as a top dressing. Simply spread a 1-2 inch thick layer of the compost over the soil surface of your potted plants. This will slowly release nutrients into the soil, providing a steady supply of food for your plants.

If you want to give your potted plants an extra boost, you can also make chicken manure tea. To do this, steep aged chicken manure compost in water for up to 2 weeks, and then dilute it with water before using it on your potted plants. This tea is rich in nutrients and can be used as a liquid fertilizer.

Remember, it's important to allow the chicken manure compost to age over the winter before using it in your pots. This will ensure that any harmful pathogens are broken down and that the compost is safe for your plants. Over time, the compost will naturally work into the soil through decomposition and the help of soil microorganisms.

Using chicken manure compost in pots is particularly beneficial for nitrogen-loving plants such as tomatoes, peppers, leafy greens, cucumbers, and squash. It's also great for sweet corn, pole beans, and rhubarb.

**Making Chicken Manure Tea**

Get ready to brew a nutrient-rich elixir for your potted plants with the simple process of making chicken manure tea. This organic composting method allows you to harness the power of chicken manure and turn it into a beneficial soil amendment for your garden.

**Here's how to make chicken manure tea in three easy steps:**

Gather your materials: Start by collecting fresh chicken manure from your coop. Make sure to use only manure that has been properly composted to avoid any potential health risks. You'll also need a large bucket or container, water, and a stirring stick.

Prepare the tea: Fill your bucket or container with water, leaving enough space to accommodate the manure. Add the composted chicken manure to the water, using a ratio of approximately 1 part manure to 10 parts water. Stir the mixture well, ensuring that the manure is thoroughly incorporated.

Let it steep and strain: Allow the chicken manure tea to steep for 24 to 48 hours, stirring occasionally. This will allow the nutrients from the manure to infuse into the water. After the steeping period, strain the tea to remove any solid particles, using a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth.

Now, your chicken manure tea is ready to use! Dilute the tea with water, using a ratio of approximately 1 part tea to 10 parts water. This will prevent any potential burning of your plants due to the concentrated nutrients. Use the diluted tea to water your potted plants, providing them with a boost of organic goodness.

Your plants will thrive and thank you for the beneficial soil amendment that chicken manure tea provides.

**Safety Tips for Composting With Chicken Manure**

For safe and effective composting with chicken manure, there are important safety tips to keep in mind. Composting with chickens can be a great way to turn waste into garden gold, but it's crucial to take precautions to protect yourself and your plants.

First and foremost, always wear gloves when handling chicken manure. This will help protect you from any bacteria or pathogens that may be present. Chicken droppings can contain harmful organisms, so it's important to minimize direct contact with your skin.

Additionally, it's crucial to use only aged or composted chicken manure on your soil. The composting process helps break down the manure and reduces the risk of spreading any potential harmful organisms. Fresh chicken manure can be high in nitrogen, which can burn your plants if not properly composted.

When using chicken manure compost, it's best to avoid spreading it directly on your vegetable gardens. While composted chicken manure is generally safe, there's still a small risk of contamination. Instead, use it on non-edible plants or mix it with other compost materials before applying it to your garden.

It's also important to thoroughly wash any raw vegetables that have been grown with chicken manure compost. This will help eliminate any remaining bacteria and ensure the safety of your food.

Lastly, keep your compost piles covered. This will prevent direct contact with chicken manure and help deter pests from getting into your compost. By taking these safety precautions, you can enjoy the benefits of composting with chicken manure while keeping yourself and your plants healthy.

**Getting Started With Composting With Chickens**

To successfully begin composting with chickens, it's essential to understand what chickens can and can't eat as part of the compost pile. Chickens can eat a wide variety of organic matter, including fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells, and garden trimmings. However, there are certain items that shouldn't be included in the compost pile, such as meat, dairy products, and oily or greasy foods. These items can attract pests and rodents, which can be harmful to the chickens and disrupt the composting process.

Once you have a good understanding of what chickens can eat, the next step is to set up a compost pile that's easily accessible to the chickens but protected from other wildlife. You can accomplish this by using a compost bin with secure sides and a lid. The bin should be tall enough to prevent the chickens from getting in and scratching out the compost, but also low enough for you to easily add and mix the organic matter.

Choosing a well-drained area for the compost pile is also important. Excess moisture can lead to anaerobic conditions and slow down the composting process. Additionally, consider the number of chickens you have and the amount of waste they produce when determining the size of the compost pile. You want to make sure you have enough space for all the organic matter to break down properly.

To get started with composting, you can follow either the intensive or passive composting method. The intensive method involves regularly turning the compost pile and monitoring its moisture levels. This method produces faster results but requires more effort. On the other hand, the passive method involves simply letting the compost pile sit and decompose naturally over time. This method requires less maintenance but takes longer to produce usable compost.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, composting with chickens is a golden opportunity to transform waste into a nutrient-rich treasure for your garden.

By harnessing the natural behaviors of chickens, you can speed up the composting process and create high-quality compost that will nourish your plants.

Not only does this practice benefit the environment by reducing waste, but it also provides a sustainable and cost-effective solution for both chickens and homesteaders.

So why not let your chickens turn waste into garden gold? It's a feather in your cap and a feast for your plants!",1,1757961946.0,UrbanHomestead,0,1.0,False

In the first/second meeting we discussed topics that were important to us. I said I was looking for someone without a past as I've refrained from relationships myself. I also mentioned that in a marriage it's healthy to show emotions and affection for one another whether it's acts of service, gifts or just letting your partner know you appreciate them. She agreed those were important however she's always struggled to show emotion and it would take her time to come out of her shell which I was fine with.

A couple of meetings later, we went for food and had a great conversation and we were both aligned on majority of the topics we discussed. I felt at ease speaking to her, it didn't feel forced or awkward. I told her she ticked most of my boxes and she said she felt the same.

I was walking her home where she mentioned she 'forgot' to mention she spoke to someone for 4 years. Now, that's not something you forget to mention. However she said she never met that person 1 on 1 and they'd only see each other in group settings. Then she also said that she doesn't know if she'd ever be able to show emotions/affection to anyone which was a u-turn on ""it'll take me time to come out my shell"". She also said she was overthinking it and she prayed Isthikara however had no signs, good or bad.

I genuinely really appreciated her mindset and how thoughtful she was. However, I was really thrown off by the no affection comment. I messaged her and said that we probably shouldn't continue. However, this bugged me for days and in the back of my mind I thought I'd made a rash decision and thought I probs should compromise given how her mindset/personality was great and the fact we were aligned on everything.

Long story short, I messaged and asked if we could meet again. She politely declined and said she continued praying Isthikara and the signs she got were that we weren't good for each other.

I'll be honest I am upset however now so can't keep thinking about the signs she may have received from Allah SWT. Am I a fundamentally bad person and Allah SWT is protecting her from me? I've always suffered from low self esteem and don't really rate myself but now it's been on my mind that am I really that bad that this girl received signs to stay away from me.

Any advice to deal with this would be appreciated, JazakAllah.",4,1757961923.0,MuslimMarriage,11,1.0,False

1nhu8xy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1nhu8xy/sometimes_its_not_what_you_eat_but_how_much_you/,Sometimes it's not WHAT you eat but HOW MUCH you eat (among other things),"TL;DR I started eating less, not lying down after eating, and doing straw phonation, and I feel much better

I'm only making this post because I'm really hoping I can help somebody. 

Long story short, LPR has pretty much made life a nuisance. I like to sing (I am by no means a GOOD singer) and I was noticing changes in my voice that I just chopped up to straining and my voice changing (because unbenknownst to me, I started experiencing LPR when I was going through the ""deep voice"" part of puberty). I was always the type of singer to mainly use falsetto but I noticed it started getting harder and harder to sing up there and I thought it was puberty but it wasn't because my voice stopped getting deeper when I was like 14 and I started experiencing LPR symptoms when I was about 14-15 (which is just PERFECT timing) and I'm 16 now. My voice would get tired easily, it would get weak, sometimes my headvoice would vanish COMPLETELY, and I'd strain on notes that were super easy for me, and I'd always have this mild sore throat. At some point I  thought I literally just COULD NOT sing despite me doing it easily before. It wasn't until I noticed the dreaded cobblestone throat that I realized it wasn't me but something else.

Google told me cobblestone throat was usually caused by post nasal drip which was usually caused by something else and so forth. So I got nasal spray and drank a bunch of teas and got benadryl (DO NOT GET BENADRYL PLEASE DONT OMG) and ate spicy foods and drank apple cider vinegar which was...yikes. But nothing worked and I just did not know why. I knew that acid reflux could be one of the causes but I just thought I could NEVER have acid reflux because *I'm only 16 and that's a thing for old and fat people*. But when nothing worked. I took into account of all of my symptoms and applied them to GERD and I knew it wasn't that because I had no heart burn but then I heard of the dreaded LPR and I instantly knew it was that. It was like a weight was lifted off my shoulders and now that I finally knew the problem; I could just fix it...right? RIGHT? WRONG! Because LPR is actually caused by a bunch of other shit \[Cobblestone Throat>Post-Nasal Drip> Acid Reflux>?\]. And you have to fix the root problem to fix the acid reflux to fix the postnasal drip to fix the cobblestone throat and don't even get me started on the fucking vocal damage. And it just fucking sucked so much ass because I'm an unemployed 16 year old and I don't have the money to invest into an ENT so I knew that if I wanted to get over this shit; I was gonna have to fix it myself. So I got omeprazole which made it worse; like SOOO much worse. Like, before I was able to sing in my speaking range but after omeprazole; I literally could not speak anymore without it burning sooo bad.

And I found out omeprazole usually only makes things worse when you don't have a lot of stomach acid which meant that I either had too little stomach acid or just a normal amount. So how the fuck did I manage to develop LPR? I don't wanna just keep ranting but I think I have a fairly average amount of stomach acid; my problem is that I just eat too fucking much, I'm super tense, and I literally SCREAM when I laugh.

1. I eat too fucking much:

I grew up in a culture where when dinner was served; it didn't matter how old you were or what it was. You were getting a huge ass plate of it and you were gonna eat all of it or else you'd get in trouble somehow. And if you were skinny like I am then you would usually get a second or third serving which was fine by me because I also grew up in a culture where dinner was like the only meal of the day. It was usually something quick for breakfast with the occassional big and balanced breakfast when someone felt like it, snacks or nothing for lunch, and a huge dinner. So when you're like 8 and you're hungry from not eating all day and you have no choice but to eat what's given to you (and A LOT was given to you); you usually eat all of it and you eat it really fast and eventually you get used to overfilling your stomach. So now you're 14 years old and eating like 3 plates of food without being forced (because your parents realized maybe you shouldn't be eating that much if you don't want to) and you have dental issues so you're barely chewing your food and you're eating really fast. Eventually, you're gonna get acid reflux. And no one ever told me that maybe I shouldn't be eating until it hurts because I'm super thin naturally and they lowkey think I should be eating more than what I already am. (I'm like 5'9 and 120 lbs so yeah but this is why when bigger people have LPR they're told to lose weight)

2. I'm super tense

I'm a pretty anxious and stiff person because a lot of things that have happened in my life so I just naturally have my shoulders raised and my stomach sucked in. Not even because I had anorexia, it's like my stomach is just always ""activated"" as if I'm ready to run if I have to; it's hard to explain and that is why stress is associated with LPR because being tense can put pressure on the LES which can exacerbate reflux which is why a lot of fat people get it. Because their fat puts pressure on their LES and stomach and blah blah blah.

3: I scream when I laugh:

Pretty self explanatory but the fact that my stomach does a sort of valsava-y motion when I do this scream laugh does NOT help which can put pressure on the stomach and LES and blah blah blah. And I definitely noticed my voice would be OUT when I laugh.

So point is; I have a lot of fat people problems but most people aren't concerned about them because I'm really thin. But truthfully; I'm like if a fat person was skinny. They say that fat people with LPR need to make lifestyle changes and I've learned that that also applies to me and that could apply to you too without you even knowing. This is also why Fatphobia is really stupid, especially when Fatphobes try to pretend that they're just ""concerned"" about fat people's health but that's a whole other convo. Anyway, today I ate one serving of creamy cheese pasta and I drank coffee with cream and sugar and I experienced belching because of bloating but I stayed upright and guess what? I felt almost no acid come up. I did some straw phonation and SOVT exercises and my falsetto is already coming back and my chest voice (which is all I could sing in) is so much stronger already. I'm sure there's more nuance to my issues and I need more time to tell if eating too much was really my problem but I think overfilling my stomach was putting a lot of pressure and stretching out the part of my stomach that keeps the acid in the stomach and because I was eating more than I could hold...it had to come out somehow. So I think I just need to eat less and give both my voice and stomach some time to heal. It probably isn't that simple but sometimes it is and boy right now I really hope it is.",2,1757961684.0,LPR,2,1.0,False
1nhu7qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nhu7qx/is_this_a_breakup_text/,Is this a breakup text?,"I (f37) was seeing (m39) for three months. We had around 11 dates, and spent two nights out of town a little over a week ago which I thought went really well. 

There were never any fights, we just seemed to jive really well. We‚Äôre at the point where I wanted to define the intent a little better, wasn‚Äôt asking for labels. Most of our ‚Äúdates‚Äù after the first initial three or four were super casual hangs at my place where he spent the night and weren‚Äôt planned in advance. I was okay with this, but just wanted to confirm he was intentional and not just about sex. 

I asked if we could hang out more intentionally with like schedule or set dates, like dinner or coffee, etc. 

Dude needed to process this. Over a period of like four days and my reaching out a bit,  he did reply. After some soul searching, I think he may be avoidant attachment style. 

The text: Hey.  Ive had some rest and time to reflect.  I think we both are trying to get to the same place but are on different roads.  I really need things to fall into place naturally to find a peaceful relationship built on respect.  I understand and respect that you are looking for something more intentional.  I like you and enjoy spending time with you but I dont think my pace and time table is what you are looking for.  

Is this a breakup text? I‚Äôve never had a relationship end where everything was so good then it wasn‚Äôt out of the blue with such a vague indirect text. Either way, I‚Äôm moving on and plan to start dating others after some reflection and downtime, but am confused and still mourning the loss of him as a person because I really did like him and felt such a connection.

I wasted several months just unsure how or where to start. It wasn‚Äôt until the end of summer that I finally landed my first internship.

**Step 1: Figure Out What You Actually Want**  
If you're not interested in something, you probably won't be able to commit to it long-term, at least, I couldn‚Äôt. So I experimented. I applied to several different roles that were loosely related to my major and joined school-based projects that gave me some hands-on experience (the barriers were lower than full-time jobs or internships, but still useful).

**Step 2: Resume, Searching, Interview prep**  
Resume: Once you have any school projects, present them clearly in your resume using the STAR format, and quantify your impact wherever possible, be like: activities result in xx% improvement.  
  
Role Searching: I initially searched on Indeed and LinkedIn, but found limited and expired options for internship. I switched to¬†**Spotly.jo**bs's job board, they updated jobs in minutes, and¬†**Handshake**, where I got my first internship in college there, and several of my alumni did too.  
  
Interview prep: I used¬†**AMA Interview**¬†to predict likely questions based on job roles and my resume, and asked ChatGPT for example answers, but I rewrote and personalized every single one. I also read through¬†**Glassdoor**¬†after-interview reviews from past candidates. For general prep, I created an answer bank for phone screens and behavioral questions. For specific roles, I expanded on this outline with more targeted content. After building my own cheatsheet of interview stories, I started enjoying the interview process. The key was to practice over and over, not just writing it, but speaking it out loud until it became natural.

**Step 3: Move Toward Your Ideal Role with Targeted Projects**  
Through my own job search, and countless coffee chats with seniors and hiring managers, this advice stood out: your major or school title doesn‚Äôt matter as much as your relevant experience does, unless you're applying to companies that strictly recruit from target schools. Even if you graduate from Wharton with a finance major, it doesn‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôll get a data scientist role if you have no related projects. That‚Äôs why my first internship and my full-time job were both unrelated to my undergraduate major. I built my knowledge base through school projects tied to the industry I wanted to enter. I also identified online courses (like those on¬†**Coursera**,¬†**Udemy**) that matched job requirements, and treated them like my own unofficial minor.

It‚Äôs really just about the hook (first 3-5 seconds of a video). The ones that get views pick from the same few patterns:

Pattern 1: Hint towards the future or make a bold prediction about how things will be. *‚ÄúThis $20 tool will completely change how you handle weeknight dinners‚Äù.* This approach makes the viewer imagine what things could be like and makes them want to watch to find out how to get there.

Pattern 2: The Peer Experiment. Frame the content as a personal experiment or story, like hearing from a friend. ‚Äú*I used AI to edit my TikToks daily for 30 days and got some crazy results.‚Äù* The key with this one is the creator is sharing results to someone on the same level, there is no hierarchy. It makes viewers think *‚ÄúIf they tried it and it worked, why can‚Äôt I?‚Äù*

Pattern 3: The Mentor. Position yourself as an expert and teach the solution. *‚ÄúStop wasting money on bottled cold brew. I‚Äôll show you how to make barista-level coffee at home in 2 minutes.‚Äù* Viewers are drawn to this one because they don‚Äôt want to miss advice from an expert.

Pattern 4: The Mystery. Tease towards something unknown to drive curiosity. *‚ÄúThis looks like a regular water bottle‚Ä¶ but there‚Äôs a reason it sells out every summer.‚Äù* Viewers tend to wonder ‚Äúwhat is it that‚Äôs so special about that water bottle‚Ä¶‚Äù (or any product)

Pattern 5: The Disruptor. Be super blunt and challenge conventional wisdom. ‚Äú*Most skincare routines are a waste of money - here‚Äôs the only step that actually matters.‚Äù* When someone is this confident about something that is outside the norm, viewers wonder why

The thing is - I only figured this out because I‚Äôve been combing the internet for expert articles, watching video breakdowns, and doing deep analysis of videos that convert. Within each of these patterns there are dozens of micro-patterns beneath the surface that make it tough to get right.

I ended up building a tool that auto-writes Shoppable scripts with these hook patterns baked in. It‚Äôs free and there are a few beta spots left - mainly looking for feedback from people who deal with scripting every day. If you‚Äôre in this world, drop a comment and I‚Äôll add you to the list.

1nhu60n,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PsychologicalGift311/comments/1nhu60n/does_caffeine_help_hair_growth/,Does Caffeine Help Hair Growth?,"# Does Caffeine Help Hair Growth? The Science, Benefits & Best Uses

**Most of us rely on caffeine to kickstart our mornings‚Äîbut can it also wake up your hair follicles? Does Caffeine Help Hair Growth?** That daily cup of coffee may do more than sharpen your focus. Over the last decade, researchers and dermatologists have studied caffeine‚Äôs impact on the scalp‚Äîand the evidence suggests it can stimulate hair growth.

If you‚Äôve ever wondered whether caffeine belongs in your hair routine, this guide breaks down the science, benefits, and best ways to use it.

# The Science Behind Caffeine & Hair Follicles

Caffeine is more than an energizer‚Äîit‚Äôs a bioactive compound that can influence the hair growth cycle. Here‚Äôs what research says:

* **Penetrates Hair Follicles Quickly** A study published in the [*International Journal of Dermatology* (2007) ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17214716/)found that caffeine can penetrate the hair follicle within just **two minutes** of topical application.
* **Stimulates Keratinocyte Activity** Caffeine stimulates **keratinocytes**, the cells that produce keratin‚Äîthe protein that strengthens hair.
* [**Blocks DHT (a Leading Cause of Hair Loss)**](https://www.seddynaturals.com/pages/coffea-arabica-caffeine-oil) The same German study confirmed caffeine helps counteract **dihydrotestosterone (DHT)**, a hormone that shortens the hair cycle and causes thinning.
* **Boosts Scalp Circulation** By improving microcirculation, caffeine ensures follicles receive oxygen and nutrients needed for healthy growth.

¬†**Benefits of Using Caffeine in Hair Care**

* ¬†**Encourages Faster Growth:** Lab studies show caffeine-treated follicles grow longer than untreated ones.
* **Thicker, Stronger Strands:** Supports keratin production and reduces breakage.
* ¬†**Improved Scalp Health:** Enhances circulation for follicle nourishment.
* **Protects Against Hormonal Hair Loss:** Effective against thinning caused by DHT and postpartum shedding.

# Caffeine in Oils, Shampoos, and Treatments

Not all caffeine use is equal. Drinking coffee won‚Äôt give you the same benefits as applying it topically.

* **Topical Works Best** ‚Äì Caffeine must be applied to the scalp for direct follicle stimulation.
* **Shampoos vs. Oils**
   * *Caffeine Shampoos*: Provide short exposure during washing.
   * *Caffeine Oils/Serums*: Stay on the scalp longer, offering deeper penetration and stronger effects.
* **Best Approach** ‚Äì Growth oils that combine caffeine with rosemary, peppermint, and castor oil (like [Seddy Hair Growth Oil](https://www.seddynaturals.com/products/caffeine-hair-growth-oil)) deliver the most targeted results.

# Who Can Benefit Most from Caffeine Hair Products?

* People with **thinning hair or receding edges**
* Women experiencing **postpartum shedding**
* Men and women with **slow-growing or fragile strands**
* Anyone wanting to maintain **fuller, denser hair**

# How to Use Caffeine for Best Results

* **Apply Regularly:** 3‚Äì4 times per week.
* **Massage the Scalp:** Improves circulation and absorption.
* **Pair with Other Oils:** Rosemary and peppermint enhance results; castor oil helps with thickness.
* **Stay Consistent:** Results typically appear within **8‚Äì12 weeks**.
* **Use Protective Styles:** Minimize breakage while encouraging growth.

# FAQs About Caffeine and Hair Growth

**Q1: Can drinking coffee help with hair growth?**  
No. Caffeine must be applied topically to the scalp for effective follicle stimulation.

**Q2: How long does it take to see results?**  
Most people notice improvements after **8‚Äì12 weeks** of consistent use.

**Q3: Is caffeine safe for all hair types?**  
Yes‚Äîstraight, wavy, curly, and coily textures can all benefit.

**Q4: What‚Äôs better‚Äîcaffeine shampoo or oil?**  
Oils and serums are typically more effective since they remain on the scalp longer.

**Q5: Can men and women both use it?**  
Absolutely. Caffeine is effective for both men and women experiencing thinning, shedding, or slow growth.

¬†

**Conclusion**

So, does caffeine help hair growth? **Yes.** Science confirms that caffeine can penetrate follicles, block DHT, and improve scalp circulation‚Äîmaking it a powerful ally for stronger, thicker, healthier hair.

The secret is patience, consistency, and the right product. Whether you‚Äôre battling postpartum shedding, thinning edges, or just want a growth boost, caffeine-infused hair oils are worth the investment.

¬†

Ready to give your scalp a wake-up call? Try adding a¬†**caffeine-infused growth oil**, such as Seddy Hair Growth Oil, to your weekly routine. With time and consistency, you‚Äôll see the difference in thickness, shine, and overall hair health.¬†

I'm not married to labels, but I think I'm something of a Christian anarchist (or an anarchist Christian, if you prefer) and I get really tired of seeing working class folks in Rockwall County vote and act against their class interests. Times are lean and getting leaner for many, and I'm not content to shunt my empathy and say ""Well, you voted for it."" I'd rather work to create some class consciousness and structures that can materially improve people's lives, without hierarchy, without prejudice and without the ulterior motive of evangelism.

I'm in Fate, but at least conceptually think of the Rockwall/Heath/Fate/Royse City/McLendon-Chisholm community as a single unit - benefits of a very small county I suppose. And while Dallas has North Texas DSA and I'm a member of their Discord, that obviously all feels pretty distant and irrelevant to Rockwall County.

If anyone would be interested in this, or even interested in just grabbing a beer or coffee sometime to talk through these ideas and see what we come up with. Maybe a Discord space of our own to get some conversations going.

Edit: I should add that I grew up in Rockwall, yea even in Lakepointe Church, so I'm under no illusions regarding the county's political and social climate.",27,1757961363.0,Rockwall,11,0.73,False

I am not one to get scared on a plane and fly frequently especially on Breeze, it is my favorite airline.  However, on Saturday I feared for my life while in flight.   We were about an hour into our flight and the captain let us know that we were going to experience some turbulence and to put our seatbelts on.  Soon after the plane experienced a couple of bumps and dips, no big deal... but then we started nosediving sharply and the plane felt as if it was out of control, people began to pray out loud, scream, drinks were spilling and it felt as if the plane was going to crash.  I was in an aisle seat and looked down the aisle and could see the chaos and thought, this is it, this is the day I die.  The plane continued to drop and dive steeply and after about a minute or so, the plane tried to level out but then experienced it again and we were diving again.  The experience lasted several minutes.  Once the plane recovered the steward came by and asked if I was okay, there was coffee and drinks spilt about the cabin.  I asked what had happened and was told it was an air pocket.  It wasn't for at least another 15 minutes or so before the captain addressed the passengers to assure us of what had happened and to apologize.  No one was physically hurt but mentally I have PTSD and I may never fly again.   Anyone else on my flight feeling traumatized?",0,1757961322.0,BreezeAir,6,0.4,False

Ever since I started treatment, this motor has greatly diminished, which has made me more stable and predictable and it feels soothing -- but something feels off. I've always relied on this motor as a way to complete tasks, and to do things. I've always been amazing at work and very fast because of this motor.

I am definitely more happy, and managed, and I can watch TV now and sit still and not as explosive -- but that motor is gone and it feels weird, like empty-ish. I've always drank like 10 coffees a day to induce the motor and get me through the day but then I would be completely burnt out, and depressed.

My logic has always been: motor = happiness, no motor = depressed. And now that the motor is gone, I guess I need to stop thinking that way. I essentially chased the hyperactivity and impulsivity at work and some other things in my daily life -- but was horrible for other things.

Also a lot of people keep saying ""are you sad?"", ""you look calmer"", ""you seem tired"". Because I guess I no longer have that urge.

Please bear with me. i am not sure where this is going

Inspired to post about this by another thread I just came across: girl broke up with bf bc friends made fun of his looks and she felt embarrassed to be seen with him. 

This quote in the title is something I have heard so much growing up and I think that is a big mistake by society that has done/is doing Millennials and generations since dirty. 

*Of course, I can only talk about my own experience here and ones I have witnessed, I am not in any way generalizing.*

First off, with regards to my parents, I was lucky to have a very stable and loving and safe space during my upbringing. I was taught from very early on that I am worthy and smart and capable, and had every support I needed in many, horrific challenges I had to face. 

Still, movies, books for all ages, any media really, had ingrained this belief in me. I grew up putting so much weight on friendships and yearning for them, especially those sisterly ones. Well, I learned my lesson. Not after the first, second or tenth time. But in time. A long time. I also found out later that the dynamics and attachment styles in my romantic relationships were very much applicable to my platonic ones as well (tendencies of anxious attachment, source of this habit identified and mostly healed, it was not my parents). So I always thought it was my responsibility to care the most, basically self-sacrifice, to be worthy of those friends, and they kicked me as a thanks. It was unhealthy of course and during my adolescence, I started to detach from friendships, which I feel was the best decision. When I say I detach, I mean I always have a listening ear, I help how I can (not financially, but I offer legal solutions if requested), I ask how they need me - listening, joining in the venting, or giving advice, and I also ask for input. However I do not trust people. I expect to be betrayed. And I have a very broad definition of betrayal, I know that. So people fuck up plenty in my eyes bc I have such a strong (probably very pretentious and extremist) take on justice and moral and loyalty that I hold myself accountable to with the expectation of others meeting as well. Not to my surprise, 95% don‚Äôt. (Examples at the bottom might help to see what I mean) That is something I am working on bc it‚Äôs inherently harming myself and my potential for inner peace. 

Back to my point though: Millennials and younger are known to be serial dating, and that is the product of so, so many issues in society and industry and more. I do firmly believe however that it is also the fact that a lot of people care far too much about what friends think. Sure, some friends (real friends) tell you like it is when you need a reality check, and do it with kindness and love (even tough love). I have two friends like that where I (for now) feel like I have that sorta dynamic with, and vice versa, and I cherish them. And then there‚Äôre the ones who aren‚Äôt happy for your success, try to passively humble you when you are on a high, use your insecurities to hold you back, or - as in the post that led me to write this - use the power of friendship tactic to instill doubts (about sth suuuper superficial) if you are just a little bit too happy in your relationship. 

I believe friendship are important. Bc companionship is important. Connection. Just like family, work, romantic partners‚Ä¶. But most of all: you. In my opinion, we should try to instill in the next generations the mindset of independence. Not asocial or antisocial living, not without trust or love. But first and foremost in healthy and self-aware trust and love in yourself. Not to ask others for their input. I know this isn‚Äôt possible as easily as it sounds and there are so many goddamn obstacles in society that not even the most basic mental health/ mindset can be guaranteed. It‚Äôs just one aspect I believe is important. The anxiety and maybe evolutionary need and want to be part of a pack should never surpass the desire to trust yourself and your judgment, and if you don‚Äôt feel confident in making a judgment, don‚Äôt make one. Grow into it. And don‚Äôt give others the power to do it for you. 

Obviously this is spoken from a very privileged perspective, having had a strong foundation at home and people to turn to when in need, and I know that that is not a given for everyone. And I feel for them. And I cannot say I would be any different, turning to ‚Äúfriends‚Äù bc there would be nobody else, if I hadn‚Äôt known that I have two people in my corner at all times. I am going in circles and not getting my point across maybe bc I do see the nuances in it and I want to acknowledge them‚Ä¶

How do you think about this matter? What are your experiences? Have I successfully made my (or any) point clear or is clarification required?


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

2 examples for ‚Äúbetrayal‚Äù of my friends over the years that irked me - again, I know they might sound super stupid and absolute kindergarten (I am over these situations, really don‚Äôt care anymore, typing them out alone is exhausting bc it feels so unnecessary, I just want to give context) and that is fair. Happy to get feedback.

1. I do *not* feel entitled to it, only am confused by a pattern by the girls in one friend group (girls plus bfs) inviting me to group activities, the girls being all ‚Äúgirl power‚Äù with me in this very setting, yet continuing to leave me out of girl group outings (coffee breaks, lunch etc). Again, not feeling entitled at all, just confused and irritated bc they keep scheduling these meetings with me in the same room. Feels insensitive, and if I were to exclude a person present, I would do so in private, but at the very least out of tact, I would include them when talking about it with them present. 


2. Used to have an ex (‚ÄúJustin‚Äù) that was in the same sports club than one good friend (‚ÄúAmy‚Äù) and me. Another girl in that club and former good friend of mine and best friend of ex was ‚ÄúClara‚Äù. I had broken up with Justin, Clara acted like a friend to me, turned around and fucked him. Amy knew, as did the whole club, didn‚Äôt tell me, I learned months later. Told her about it and how much it hurt. Now the betrayal: Amy proudly declaring to me a year later that she leaves traveling the world with Clara. I know I would never do that. A) leave with a backstabbing person, bc traveling together is fairly full of compromising and I know Amy refuses to compromise (picky eater, health issues etc) and you cannot trust an untrustworthy person, B) loyalty to friend (me) and C) tell (me) so proudly.

I‚Äôm a pretty simple person at heart. Evenings usually mean coffee, music on low, and something good to watch. I‚Äôm introverted at first, but once I‚Äôm comfortable I‚Äôm talkative, loyal, and consistent. I like easy, honest chats sharing small wins from the day, swapping songs, laughing at a scene we pause, and making little plans we actually do. Slow burn over fast drama.

Some of the things I enjoy: anime and K-dramas with heart (Naruto, Demon Slayer, always open to recs), story-driven movies, late-night playlists, cooking simple meals, hiking and quiet walks, stargazing, and visiting museums or cafes instead of parties. I also like a clean all-black look. Used to game a lot, now it‚Äôs Genshin once in a while. I love travel (Japan and Switzerland are on top of my list), but honestly a calm weekend at home is perfect too.

My faith is an important part of my life. I was raised Christian Orthodox and while I‚Äôm not perfect, I try to keep Christ at the center of what I do. I value honesty, kindness, and consistency, and I‚Äôd love to share that journey with someone who respects and values faith too.

I‚Äôm hoping to meet someone kind, steady, and emotionally open. Age isn‚Äôt a huge deal, but somewhere in the 22-29 range would be ideal. Long distance is fine as long as the effort is mutual, and if things work out, I‚Äôd be open to closing the gap.

If any of this resonates, just say hi and tell me your comfort song or movie I‚Äôll share mine back.

1nhtnka,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1nhtnka/trip_report_two_37_year_old_women_1_week_in_paris/,"Trip Report - Two 37 year old women, 1 week in Paris (including quick strip to Strasbourg)","My sister and I stayed in Paris from Sept. 7th to the 14th. This group was extremely helpful when I was planning the trip so trying to share what may be helpful for others.

**Overall summary:** Our trip was amazing! Beautiful city, very good food, great shopping, and just a wonderful place with great vibes. 

Not once did we feel unsafe or even see any attempted pickpocketing. We also unknowingly avoided all the protests, didn't see a thing (even though a wall of the building right next to where we were staying was set on fire during the protest). 

All in all, highly recommend!

**General Tips:** I used both the citymapper app (ideal for metro travel) and google maps (better for walking) for navigation.

**Metro tickets and Apple Watch** \- 

Be aware that if you load the ""navigo pass/card"" on your apple watch, you need to purchase future tickets via your watch to that ""card"". First time getting from the airport it was a breeze and I loved that I didn't need to have my phone out. 

Next time, I think I accidently purchase another ""card"" via my phone and when I sent it to my watch, the readers were still picking up the first card which was now empty, this caused a bit of confusion and was very annoying until I figured out what happened. 

I had to delete the second card from my watch, then re-load all future passes via the watch.

**Food** \- we didn't make planned reservations weeks in advance, instead just used the LeFork app when we were hungry to find a place nearby. Worked very well every time and we even got 20% discounts.

**Shopping** \- Do it! Get the thing. I didn't go crazy but there were a few items I definitely wanted to get - jeans, shoes, perfume. 

A few times I thought, oh perhaps I'll just get it online later once I'm  back home. DO NOT DO THIS! I checked the price of the items once I returned (to the US) and the price was 101% MORE (I accounted for the euro to $ conversation) to order it online (not including shipping) even from stores that we have in the US.

And if you do the VAT text refund, even more savings!

**Train tickets to outside of Paris** \- Try to get these in advance if at all possible, the price swings were wild when we got our tickets to Strasbourg and it was very stressful buying tickets vis the app at 1am for the next morning!

 Don't be us, plan ahead for your own sanity. I used the SNCF Connect App and once I figured it out it was easy.

**Timing:** Just note it seems almost impossible to get any coffee or croissant before 8am, and most stores and shops close at 7ish.

**Coffee:** I tried a few things (at home I make my own espresso with frothed milk). Caf√© noisette was usually good, but not enough for me (its an espresso shot with a side of steamed milk). 

I mostly ordered a Cafe creme, and that was perfect for me, a few times however they ""convinced"" me to get a latte which was also fine, but obviously cost more (to be fair also had double shots of espresso too). Some lattes were WAY too milky, so just try a few things to figure out what you like.

**My Itinerary Breakdown by day**:

**Day 1** \- total wash for me since my flight was delayed and it took me 36 hours in total to get to Paris! However the RER line to where we were staying (near Pompidou) was direct and easy. If you are ever stuck at JFK, I highly recommend going to the TWA hotel and hanging out.

**Day 2 (Monday)** \- I was on my own so I tried to tackle a lot of the things my sister was not interested in doing.

8am - went to **Notre Dame,** no line was super easy to get in. However there was a service in progress so I waited until it was over 8:45 to see the back. going up was closed, they said it'll open after Sept. 20th.

9am - made my way over to **Sainte-Chapelle**, slowly and here is my first major mistake, I was about 10min late getting there so the line for no reservations was pretty long. 

That cost me 3hrs of wait time! The website reservation was down so there was no way to reserve a timed slot and I knew if I wanted to see it this was my only chance.

A good portion of the non reservation group was let it at opening, I was basically first in line after that, and kept hoping they would let in a little at a time (second mistake/ assumption). For the first hour I listened to the LeWalk app tour, after an hour I thought we would be (at least a few of us) let in any moment. 

By the second hour, I was trying to ask the workers there how long they think the wait would be, they did not speak English and in general basically ignored us. When I finally did get some sort of answer they said 1/2 hour. 

By the end it ended up being 3 hours of waiting, with no movement of the line progressing. So my only advice would be, get there EARLY, like 8:45 or earlier if you want to try and get inside with the first batch of folks. Obviously this somewhat soured by experience of Sainte-Chapelle.

Got brunch at LouLou ""Friendly Diner"" and it was okay, decor was cute, not amazing. I made my way over to **Shakespeare & Co**. It was a bit crowded but not crazy. Their cafe has a great view of Notre Dame, but the folks sitting there were smoking so I choose to move on.

2ish - I started heading over to the **Louvre** for my 3pm reservation, again I would encourage getting into the line a bit early, about 15min before your reservation. 

I saw everything I wanted in the Louvre, and even did the Mona Lisa twice (second and last stop before closing) when it was much less crowded. I will say unless you have a very good sense of direction or do not mind wandering, it is very easy to get lost. 

Make a rough plan for what you want to see and stick with it. I managed to do the entire first floor (all wings) and the European sculptures all done. But I was on my own, walked fast through things that didn't interest me a ton and I have been to Louvre before. I did use the LeWalk app for some of it.

Found a place for dinner that was nearby (I was exhausted at this point) by using the LeFork app and found Chez Suzy - an amazing restaurant connected to the Hotel Regina Louvre. It was a wonderful experience, best duck I have ever had, and they were super accommodating, polite, professional and I couldn't recommend the place enough. I ended spending 3 hours there by myself!

**Day 3 (Tuesday)** \- We took it easy, had a lazy morning and found a random almost street vendor type of place for crepes (do not recommend) but we had a table with a nice view of Tour Saint-Jacques so it was okay. We went to **Musee Jacquemart-Andre** and it was very nice. We easily got tickets there and it was not crowded at all. Rest of the day was for walking around, shopping, and just enjoying the city.

**Day 4 (Wednesday)** \- Had reservations to **Musee de L'Organgerie** (booked about a week in advance). Walked around a lot then headed to **La Galerie Dior** (also had timed pre-booked tickets). This I highly recommend if you are interested at all in design or fashion. Amazing museum and the exhibits were so creative, interesting, and of course beautiful. Just a joy overall. Ended the day at Ma Dame restaurant, connected to the Marignan Hotel. Highly recommend! Beautiful decor, amazing food, and the service was outstanding.

**Day 5 (Thursday)** \- Mostly walking and shopping, saw Petite Palais, Pont Alexandre III (gorgeous bridge), Palais-Royal, etc. Ended up at Le Bucheron for dinner. It was quite good, but can't compare it to the other two places we've been.

**Day 6/7 (Friday/Saturday)** \- Had breakfast at ""Urban Bakery"" this was the only instance of having some language barrier issues. It was a ""take away"" place, but had tables, so we ordered and ended up not getting a lot of what we had asked and paid for. Our only sub-par service experience. They we very nice, but wasn't the best experience. Took the train to Strasbourg and spent time there with family.

**Final Day (Sunday)** \- My flight was at 4:30 (my sister's was first thing in the morning) so I decided to make my way to **Montmartre** since we had not been there yet. I did the LeWalk tour, and it was perfect for a quick feel of the place. When I can come to Paris again, I think I'll try to stay in this area so I can explore it in more detail. 

Getting to the airport was a little more complicated because they closed a portion of the RER line, I ended up checking various apps to find the best route and eventually made it via D train and then a bus.

Hope that helps! I can't wait to go back. Thank you to all the folks in Paris for such a wonderful experience!",15,1757960376.0,ParisTravelGuide,2,0.9,False

I've thinking about my therapist and how I must be disappointing her with my lack of progress, but I'm too much of a people-pleaser to being up that I'm contemplating quitting. Plus I have a lot of repressed anger and I'd be afraid I'd blow up and blame my lack of progress on her. I don't even need therapy and I don't wanna change. Well, I'll change on my own terms. I wanna run away but I always end up stuck doing the same thing over and over again.

I don't know why I'm thinking so much about her. Probably because she's the only person I talk to on an emotionally intimate basis (as emotionally intimate as you can get with a slab of concrete like me), and the last time I actually talked to her about my depression and how I was feeling, I feel like she completely blew me off.

Meds don't work, they just make me numb. Which is better than the anxiety/OCD I was dealing with before, I guess. I should probably get off this medication and try another one, but I have the fear that autistic burnout is causing my depressed mood, and meds will never work.

Coffee and alcohol are the only two things that bring me any joy - that's it. Even music is unsatisfying to me now.

There's no way I'm suited for any type of love or connection, with how disconnected I am from the world around me. Yeah, I put on a happy face, but ultimately, my mind is elsewhere most days.

i work in an unskilled kitchen barely scraping 30 hours a week, i work my arse off but there seems no upward trajectory there.

i‚Äôm barely surviving as a 22 year old man, ruined my last relationship because i was an immature 20 year old, did the right thing, took the time away, found someone else and she cheated on me within 3 months.

my best friend is addicted to opioids and benzodiazepines, i myself have recently managed to kick the need for drugs and now i feel like i‚Äôm sat in an empty room screaming for help and i don‚Äôt know where to turn

i love clothes, art, graffiti, fashion, coffee, beer, football and adore cooking.

any advice would be amazing.

EDIT: i‚Äôm only 8 responses in and i‚Äôm in absolute tears thank you all so much for your kindness ",39,1757960017.0,Leeds,36,0.87,False
