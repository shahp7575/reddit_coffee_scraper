1mnupjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mnupjj/my_girlfriend_revealed_her_true_colors_after_our/,My girlfriend revealed her true colors after our breakup and it‚Äôs hard to cope with,"
My girlfriend and I were together for over a year. I‚Äôm a barista and she was a customer. Our breakup was supposedly mutual. We said we still love each other but it wasn‚Äôt working. 

After our breakup, she continued ordering lattes from me every day. I let it slide, but it made me uncomfortable making lattes for my ex. Especially right after our breakup. I can‚Äôt choose whom I serve, but she can choose to order or not. She would order online, but totally ignore me during pickup, avoiding all eye contact with the baristas and storming off, in a way that I thought was passive aggressive.

I felt like she was violating no contact by forcing me to make lattes for her. It made me increasingly uncomfortable until after a month I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I sent her a text that said ‚ÄúHey I can‚Äôt stop you but i feel like you haven‚Äôt been giving me space at work. If you could think about coming when I‚Äôm not there I would really appreciate it. And if you do come, please at least say thank you and be polite to me and my coworkers, we‚Äôre still serving you and deserve to be treated respectfully.‚Äù My coworkers knew she was my ex and her behavior made them uncomfortable too. 

I said I‚Äôm not going to tell her where to get her coffee, but just to consider how it makes me feel. I was hoping we could have an adult conversation about it. 

She sent a response that blamed me for her behavior saying she only acted that way because I ignored her the week before (which is a lie, she‚Äôd been acting that way for a whole month) and she said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about you, I just want my coffee‚Äù

This bothers me for so many reasons. Firstly, it is about me. I‚Äôm entitled to my boundaries, especially when I‚Äôm at work. Also she clearly wasn‚Äôt even thinking about my boundaries at all, it was all about her and her routine. It would‚Äôve been different if she had given me some space at first, but she came in the same day after we broke up and never stopped. She didn‚Äôt apologize and tried to make it all my fault, while also implying that my boundaries don‚Äôt matter, and that a latte is more important than me being comfortable at work.

I sent her a text explaining all this and she never responded, but she hasnt come in for two weeks. 

I‚Äôm just so hurt that she would be so immature and nasty towards me, not just disrespecting my boundaries but spitting them back in my face. It makes me so sad that this is how it ended. I never lost my temper with her, I think about her all the time. I even tried going on another date (big mistake, but I was desperate to move on) and I cried when I came home and deleted all the apps because it felt so unfair to her to try dating again so soon. I put up with her behavior for a month before saying anything cus I wanted her to be comfortable. And yet she had instantly disregarded all of my feelings after the breakup and threw me into the trash. 

I wanted us to be on good terms. I tried. It hurts me so much that it had to be like this. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ever seeing her or talking to her again. And because she is so avoidant and defensive I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs even going to realize her own actions or do any self reflection. It‚Äôs such a damn shame.

It‚Äôs been a while now and my negotiations with doctors have caused me to receive a lower dose.

I have been told that with these medications it‚Äôs better to taper off which is why I‚Äôm now on the lowest dose.

However since I‚Äôm at the stage of being on the lowest dose surely it wouldn‚Äôt be so out there to think that I cannot have another dose ever.

I would not recommend this however privately I‚Äôve been drinking coffee and smoking as I have heard it breaks down the medication quicker.

What‚Äôs Going On?,"Yesterday evening around 7 PM, my 2022 Honda Pilot (68k miles) suddenly lit up with several warning messages:
	‚Ä¢	Adaptive Cruise Control Problem
	‚Ä¢	Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) Problem
	‚Ä¢	Lane Keeping Assist Problem
	‚Ä¢	Auto High Beam Problem
	‚Ä¢	Brake System light (yellow)

The car was still driving totally normal, so I kept going. I tried turning the car off and on multiple times last night, but the warnings stayed.

This morning at 8 AM, the warnings were still there when I started the car. I drove about 5 minutes to get coffee, turned the car off, came back after 5 minutes, and when I restarted, the lights were gone. I drove for a few hours with no warnings.

Later, I dropped the car off for an oil change. After picking it up, I started the car and boom‚Ä¶ the same warning lights came back.

Other than the lights, the car runs perfectly. Brakes feel normal, no weird noises, steering feels fine. I replaced the battery just over a month ago, so it‚Äôs fairly new.

Has anyone seen this happen? Is it safe to keep driving for a few days until I get it looked at? Could this be a sensor or camera issue instead of something mechanical?

1mnujeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concussion/comments/1mnujeh/3_week_post_concussion_boxer/,3 week post concussion (boxer),"TLDR at the bottom, after the lore if you would like the story.


It is about 3 weeks since I got my concussion (I was training for a muay thai competition and got hit a bit hard near the back of my head by a training partner)


Next day I had some light sensitivty, brain fog and generally felt off. Went to GP and got checked out (balance and eyes okay), told to rest and take the week off work. Still did some light walks and tried to reduce screen time etc. Started to feel better after a few days.


Following week I did half days at work and I managed okay, and I did light walks, was feeling almost back to normal


Last week I did full time hours, and tried adding some weight training again as I felt better. Did what I considered fairly light but was only a bit lighter than my norm (in hindsight). By Thursday I had brain fog doing a short drive and my anxiety went up.


Since then, I've done a couple of social things with rest in between, and only done light walks, and recently got approved for another two weeks of lighter hours at work, but I am incredibly anxious about how long this might go on for. I am struggling a bit with off and on brain fog and fatigue after work/the few social things I've done recently, and the odd light headache/strange feeling in head.


Today I felt good after a 9h sleep, and I decided to do a short 10 min walk that gave me brain fog. I came home and it seemed to subside not long after. 


I'm conscious I probably overdid some things last week (doing strength training and more walks on top of my full time hours).


I went from training 5-6 times a week in a high intensity sport to just being allowed to walk so I know this is a huge contrast, and I am also someone who is a bit more on the ""sensitive"" side, prone to anxiety and overthinking. 


What I'm currently doing:

I already eat a good diet due to my sport, and I have recently decided to cut out coffee to help my anxiety. I do guided meditations daily for mindfulness and I have therapy fortnightly. I try to monitor my screen time and I am currently doing reduced hours at work. 


TLDR - I am still somewhat early days after a concussion but I am wondering if I should be taking other measures that I'm not already doing. I am conscious my anxiety might exacerbate some symptoms, and I caused myself a setback by doing too much too soon, but I'm also aware this could go on longer than predicted and I am freaking out a little bit. 

Would love just some advice and/or kind words as I feel a little bit alone here. I do know a few people who have had concussions (esp from my sport) but they have gotten over them fairly quickly.

1mnufyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1mnufyf/today_was_our_back_to_school_lunchraffle_for/,Today was our back to school lunch/raffle for staff and I won a car,"Today we had our annual back to school lunch for staff. They do a raffle which normally consists of smalls prizes like $10 gift cards, T shirts, coffee mugs, etc. Previous years have had 5 or so winners so no big money was spent. 

At the beginning of the raffle, our superintendent mentioned this year we would have a ‚Äúbig prize‚Äù that may or may not be a car. We were all super confused because our district? Giving away a car? The same district the starts teachers at $45,000/year??? No way. 

So he does the drawings for the smaller prizes, then comes the ‚Äúbig prize‚Äù drawing and this time he mentions it **is** a car. My name gets picked! They have me come up to the front and say they are bringing the car out now. I‚Äôm super nervous and excited because wtf?! Did I just win a car?! This is definitely needed. They bring out the car and it is a‚Ä¶a fucking remote control car for a toddler, the ones they can ride in. 

What. The. Fuck. I‚Äôve had time to process it and so many things are running through my mind. 

1. What a fucking slap in the face to make me and all of us believe there was a car in the drawing. To make me believe I won it for that minute. 

2. Why is this even in the drawing?? I am a 5th grade teacher what use could I possible get out of a remote control car meant for toddlers! I have a child that is way too big for it so it‚Äôs not like I could give it to him. But even if I had a toddler, why is the ‚Äúbig prize‚Äù meant for teachers for a toddler?!? This is all so weird. 

4. I looked up the prices of this remote control car and they go for like $200 on Amazon. Why not just make the prize $200?!? I don‚Äôt mean to sound ungrateful, but what is the point in this?! 

5. What the fuck?! I have never felt so disrespected in my career before. I‚Äôm so furious.

It sounded kind of delusional, but hearing her story made me realize I had a very similar experience with my dentist. Except,mine actually had a happy ending.

I was 22 at the time, and he was 25. It started two years ago, not long after I‚Äôd moved to North America. I had just gotten a new job that came with dental insurance. Since it was basically ‚Äúuse it or lose it,‚Äù I booked a cleaning. I‚Äôd been hoping to see the older lady who owned the clinic, but her schedule was full, so they booked me with another dentist instead. 

When he walked into the room, I honestly thought he‚Äôd made a mistake. He looked at most one year older than me. Later I learned he‚Äôd skipped some grades and finished dental school early. He had this clean, subtle cologne on, and his voice was calm and reassuring. After checking my teeth, he told me I had five cavities, both upper and lower, and needed to come back to get them filled. Then the front desk handed me the estimate, almost $2,000. My stomach dropped. A few minutes later, he stepped out from another treatment room, and in this low, kind voice, told me he could give me 20% off the portion not covered by insurance and would waive the fee for one area entirely. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wait too long,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúor all five might need root canals.‚Äù And then‚Ä¶ he took off his mask. Six feet tall, ridiculously good looking, with a warm smile that made my brain short circuit. 

I debated for days whether I should give him my number. I knew the chances weren‚Äôt high he was my dentist but worst case, I‚Äôd never see him again. So I decided to take the risk. The second time I went in, I dressed up a little more and slipped a note with my name and number into his hand when his assistant stepped out. He looked completely caught off guard, eyes wide, smiling, then immediately reached for his phone. But his phone wasn‚Äôt with him, so he started rifling through drawers for a pen. He scribbled his name and number on the back of my note,only to realize that note was meant for him to keep. Laughing at himself, he searched again until he found a sticky note, rewrote his number, and handed it over. 

Less than an hour after I got home, he texted. He apologized for not messaging sooner, explaining that an emergency patient had come in right after I left. Then he asked if the anesthesia had worn off yet, warning me that one of the cavities was deep and might hurt later. He told me not to just tough it out. if it started to hurt, I should go get Advil. We kept talking after that. I learned he‚Äôd grown up here, had just graduated a year ago, and was splitting his time between this clinic and another in a small town an hour away. ‚ÄúHere is way too competitive,‚Äù he said with a shrug. A few days later, he asked if I‚Äôd like to grab coffee. I said yes without a second‚Äôs hesitation. When we met, he wasn‚Äôt in scrubs. Instead, he wore a crisp white shirt, a dark blue denim jacket, sneakers, and that same faint scent I remembered from the clinic now mixed with a trace of clinic disinfectant.

Without the professional setting, he looked even younger, like a university student you‚Äôd notice on the street and glance back at a second time. I didn‚Äôt have much coffee that day because I was so nervous. he mentioned how competitive the healthcare field really is. Since high school, he‚Äôs never had a proper break. From undergrad straight into dental school, he barely had time off except for Christmas. After graduating, he took less than a week‚Äôs rest before heading to a remote northern town to work and gain experience. Life there was basically just work, grocery shopping, and sleep,on repeat. He had only moved back to in town last month. I was stunned and asked, ‚ÄúHow can you handle that kind of mental pressure for so many years without a break?‚Äù He just smiled and said he‚Äôd gotten used to it, and that he still had half a million of student loans to pay off, so he didn‚Äôt dare slow down.",0,1754959087.0,relationship_advice,8,0.2,False

I only am because he‚Äôs transferring to another store by the end of this week and I work during his last two shifts. The only issue is when, especially since we both work in retail in a small yet busy environment. In other words, I have no time to bring up a potential lunch/coffee date in a casual manner without all of my coworkers hearing me or sounding like I‚Äôm being hasty. We also clock out at different times and lunch breaks are out of the question too since my department strongly prefers only one person to go on break at a time due to how busy we can be.

My only possible options are (in no realistic order): 1) write him a note and either give it to him or leave it by his belongings 2) text his number (we‚Äôre in a work group chat) 3) ask him to wait for me since I clock out 30 minutes after he does on his last day so I can tell him after work 4) just go for it even if my coworkers are within earshot and we‚Äôre gonna be super busy (but casually) 5) somehow ask my manager to let me take a lunch break at the same time he does. I want to be casual about it so not to put pressure on him during work but I also want to get my point across.

The Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) reports foreign direct investment hitting record highs, with over $1.7 billion secured last year. The government‚Äôs ‚ÄúGolden Residency‚Äù initiative, rolled out early 2025, has made high-value talent attraction even easier, while new rules now allow 99% foreign ownership for select business activities (see more).\
\
Importantly, Bahrain offers regional business advantages above its Gulf neighbors ‚Äî ultra-low setup costs, fewer ownership restrictions, and a legal framework rooted in English common law, yet culturally attuned.\
\
And compared to the UAE, where arbitration can stretch on for months, the BCDR‚Äôs efficient processes ‚Äî and its real teeth in enforcement ‚Äî make it an indispensable safety net for anyone involved in Bahrain company formation.\
The Bahrain Chamber for Dispute Resolution (BCDR): A Practical Overview\
What Is the BCDR?\
The BCDR is Bahrain‚Äôs internationally recognized arbitration and mediation hub. Established in collaboration with the American Arbitration Association, the BCDR operates independently from the judiciary but enjoys statutory authority under Bahraini law. Its function? To resolve commercial disputes swiftly, confidentially, and in a business-friendly manner ‚Äî crucial for both multinationals and startups navigating Bahrain‚Äôs growing marketplace.\
Why Do Businesses Rely on the BCDR?\
\
Speed and Efficiency: Average BCDR arbitration takes 6-10 months. Compare that to 18-36 months via traditional courts.\
Enforceability: Decisions are recognized and enforceable both locally and under the New York Convention abroad.\
Expertise: Arbitrators and mediators with regional and international experience ‚Äî many are bilingual and familiar with Khaleeji business norms.\
\
(I once steered a JV dispute involving a facilities management company in the Seef District. What saved our timeline was the BCDR‚Äôs structured settlement conference model, which cut through cultural deadlock.)\
How Does the BCDR Work, Step-by-Step?\
1. Initiation\
\
File a ‚ÄúRequest for Arbitration‚Äù via the BCDR portal or in-person at BCDR‚Äôs headquarters in the Diplomatic Area.\
Pay the registration fee (typically BHD 425-750 depending on claim).\
Submit supporting documents: commercial contract, official correspondence, payment proof.\
\
2. Case Management\
\
The BCDR assigns a case manager and notifies both parties.\
Arbitrators are appointed, either by agreement or by the BCDR if parties can‚Äôt concur.\
Preliminary meeting (often held in a majlis-style conference room for informal rapport-building).\
\
3. Hearing & Submissions\
\
Written statements and evidence presented (remote participation now available post-2025 rule update).\
Hearings in English or Arabic ‚Äî with professional interpreters if needed.\
Emphasis on documentary evidence (witness cross-exams are rare, barring fraud or serious misconduct).\
\
4. Award & Enforcement\
\
Final award issued within 30-45 days of the final hearing.\
Enforcement through local courts if necessary ‚Äî expedited under Bahrain‚Äôs arbitration law.\
\
Pro Tip: Always pre-prepare your commercial contract with a BCDR arbitration clause ‚Äî it‚Äôs the fastest route to resolution. Templates and suggested language are downloadable from BCDR‚Äôs official site.\
Ownership, Structure, and the BCDR‚Äôs Role in Bahrain Company Formation\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, showing a professional team in Bahrain.), structuring your company correctly is paramount.\
\
Options: WLL (With Limited Liability), SPC (Single Person Company), BSC (Bahrain Shareholding Company), and now, Free Zone entities (Free Zone guide).\
When to Use BCDR: Any dispute between shareholders, co-founders, or commercial partners can leverage BCDR for pre-court resolution ‚Äî notably faster and less public than litigation through MOICT.\
\
\
Surprisingly, a common mistake is omitting the BCDR clause from foundational documents. I‚Äôve seen a tech startup in Bahrain Bay lose months just arguing over jurisdiction ‚Äî easily preventable.\
\

Cost Considerations: Fees, Budgets, and Value\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain businesses, showing calculators and finance documents.\
- Arbitrators‚Äô Fees: Scaled by claim value; min. BHD 2,000 for routine disputes, rising to BHD 25,000+ for multimillion-dollar cases.\
- Legal Costs: Local lawyers typically quote BHD 3,000‚Äì7,500 per arbitration phase.\
- Translations/Interpreters: BHD 200‚Äì700 per session (often required for international founders).\
For a strong, up-to-date cost breakdown on registration and setup, see Bahrain company formation cost.\
Insider Tips: Cut Time and Save Money\
\
Best Application Windows: Early mornings (8:00‚Äì9:30 am) at MOICT or BCDR, especially before Ramadan.\
Document Prep Shortcut: Have digital and hard copies pre-stamped ‚Äî many officials still insist on wet-ink signatures, but pre-verifying via Sijilat can cut delays.\
Office Location Hack: The Diplomatic Area and Bahrain Bay offices offer fastest walk-in processing. (I learned the hard way ‚Äî Seef District queues can stretch to 90 minutes on Sundays!)\
Bundle Services: Some accounting firms provide package rates for company formation, ongoing compliance, and arbitration representation, saving up to 30% on recurring legal and admin fees (trusted provider here).\
\
The BCDR Process: Documentation, Compliance, and Pitfalls\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, showing professional handling of company paperwork..\
- Commercial Registration (CR) certificate ‚Äî obtainable through Sijilat.\
- LMRA (Labour Market Regulatory Authority) clearance, if involving staff disputes.\
- Proof of attempted negotiation (mandatory under 2025 BCDR procedural update, effective January 1st).\
\
New Regulation (2025): All CR renewals now require a compliance declaration stating any outstanding BCDR proceedings ‚Äî check with MOICT‚Äôs online portal for latest templates.\
\
Compliance Nuances and Local Customs\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, showing contract signing and legal paperwork in Bahrain. and customary business etiquette ‚Äî especially during initial meetings at BCDR or MOICT. A tray of Arabic coffee, patient small talk, and recognition of Ramadan-adjusted working hours can make or break your application progress.\
(Bahraini officials tend to favor face-to-face negotiation; my own experience during a mediation was transformed by breaking the ice with stories from Manama‚Äôs old souq ‚Äî it works.)\
For ongoing regulatory requirements post-formation, trusted accounting and bookkeeping partners are invaluable, particularly during Sijilat renewals and EDB compliance audits.\
Support, Sponsorship, and Avoiding Common Mistakes\
\
Alt text: Professional business support, showing consultation and business advice in Bahrain. may still require a Bahraini sponsor (see more).\
Common Mistake: Underestimating Arbitration Prep\
Many founders only seek arbitration after relations have soured. A better way? Build BCDR readiness into your contracts, processes, and culture from day one.\
\
Insider Tip: Use plain English alongside Arabic in all filings ‚Äî even experienced Bahraini notaries have flagged paperwork for ‚Äúambiguity‚Äù when English legalese dominates.\
Avoidance Tactic: Schedule an annual contract review with your legal team; update all dispute clauses to reference latest BCDR rules (they change ‚Äî the 2025 update caught out several fintech clients).\
\
Tangent: Why Even Bahraini Coffee Imports Can Spark Disputes\
One oddity I encountered: a client importing specialty Yemeni coffee beans faced a delivery dispute with a local distributor. The resulting stalemate ‚Äî over a single shipment worth BHD 2,800 ‚Äî was amicably resolved at BCDR mediation, aided by a mutual appreciation for traditional coffee service customs.\
And that‚Äôs Bahrain‚Äôs secret: culture and commerce blend, even in arbitration.\
FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation and Dispute Resolution\
1. Is the BCDR mandatory for all Bahraini businesses?\
No ‚Äî but it‚Äôs strongly recommended for any business contract, especially when foreign partners are involved. BCDR clauses ensure faster, enforceable resolutions. (Reference: BCDR FAQ)\
2. How do I choose the right ownership structure for my business in Bahrain?\
Consider liability, tax, and sector restrictions. For most international entrepreneurs, WLL or SPC are optimal ‚Äî check this guide to business types.\
3. What are the main startup costs for a Bahrain company with BCDR protection?\
Budget BHD 1,500‚Äì3,000 for formation and compliance, plus additional BHD 2,000‚Äì10,000 for potential dispute resolution. Exact figures are sector-specific ‚Äî see detailed cost breakdown.\
4. What post-formation compliance steps should I watch for?\
Renew your CR annually, maintain up-to-date accounts, and file BCDR compliance declarations as required (see accounting and bookkeeping).\
5. Can I use the BCDR if I‚Äôm not Bahraini or my partners are overseas?\
Yes! BCDR‚Äôs authority extends to disputes involving local and international parties, with English or Arabic language proceedings. Registration is open to all entities registered in Bahrain.\
\
For step-by-step company formation or guidance on dispute resolution, consult experts or trusted service providers.\

### Key Differences Summary

The Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState‚Ñ¢ Tumbler excels in lid versatility and temperature retention, offering superior convenience and performance. While the Yeti Rambler offers robust insulation and durability, it lacks the FlowState‚Ñ¢ lid's multi-functionality. The Hydro Flask all Around Tumbler provides reliable insulation and a sleek design, but its lid lacks the advanced features of the Stanley. For users prioritizing lid adaptability and extended temperature maintenance, the Stanley represents a clear value over the alternatives despite its slightly higher price point. For durability and brand recognition the Yeti remains a strong contender.

1mnu5qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mnu5qw/i_think_something_terribly_wrong_is_going_on_with/,I think something terribly wrong is going on with the clinic I work at.,"Hi everyone. I wonder if anyone will read this, but thank you if you do. Something weird has been going on at work and I just feel... lost? I feel all sorts of things, really. I‚Äôm not sure what to think, or who to talk to. I saw that some people post here to talk about things they can‚Äôt really talk about anywhere else. I thought I would give it a try. I‚Äôm not the type to be very open about the irrational, so I‚Äôm not sure how to approach this. I thought about trying therapy, but they would probably just assume that I am crazy. Except this time, I want to get it out of my head, get it out there, anywhere. I‚Äôll try to keep it short and to the point, so it doesn‚Äôt take too long to read.

Before all of this, I lived in a tiny town in the middle of fields and forests. It had its charm, I won‚Äôt deny that, but it didn‚Äôt feel like I was made for this type of life. I‚Äôll be honest, I felt helpless, like I had no potential of a future there. As a high school student, there were very few job options open for us. Either we worked at one of the two tiny restaurants, the grocery store, or one of the three gas stations. That‚Äôs right, we had three gas stations, which we all thought was excessive considering that we could cross the town from one side to the other by foot within an hour. Anyway, I ended up working at a family diner. Once I finished high school, I stayed there for a few more months, so I could save up more money. Then, I moved to the city I live in now.

Life is very different here, four hundred kilometers away from home. There are hundreds of thousands of people. It‚Äôs always loud, always moving. As soon as I arrived, despite having a good amount of savings in my account, I went looking for a job. Three days later, I officially got hired at a small convenience store. I was lucky to find something so quickly. I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything fancy, really. I just wanted anything that would ease my anxiety and my fear of having to go back home if I couldn‚Äôt afford the life here. My plan was to go to college, study to become a translator, then find a job in that field. Unfortunately, after a year of studying, I accepted that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it. Long story short, my will to live was gone, I couldn‚Äôt afford groceries, rent and all the costs related to college, and I had no energy, ever. So I gave up. I quit college and kept working. After two more years, I decided to look for another job, something more permanent.

It took a while, finding a job in a city where every place is filled to the brim with employees isn‚Äôt easy. If anyone tells you: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see, they‚Äôre looking for employees everywhere!‚Äù Well, that person is full of shit. I applied to over a hundred places, and only got two responses back. I had an interview with a clothing store which didn‚Äôt lead anywhere. One night, a notification lit up my phone screen. I received an email from the Timeless Beauty Center, saying that they were hiring me! No interview, no nothing. They wanted me to start the next day.

The job is pretty simple: I‚Äôm basically a receptionist for a plastic surgery clinic and for a photography studio. I know what you‚Äôre probably thinking, I also thought it was weird when I got hired, but it quickly became normal to me. The two businesses are owned by the same woman. I‚Äôve never met her, but I heard that she is your typical rich, snobby woman. Not the type of person I would get along with, not the type to give me a second glance.

If you come in the Timeless Beauty Center, you‚Äôll find yourself in a wide, shiny, white hallway. The walls , the floor, the furniture, it‚Äôs all pure white, almost blinding. After walking a few steps, you‚Äôll then be in front of my desk, facing me. To my left, a door leads to the photography studio, and to my right, you guessed it, is another door that opens in the plastic surgery clinic. I answer calls, schedule appointments and welcome in customers and patients. I have other tasks, of course, but I‚Äôm just trying to give you a little summary of what I do so you can understand the basic idea of my job.

I couldn‚Äôt tell you how skilled our photographers are, because I‚Äôve never seen any of the pictures they take. I never questioned that, I don‚Äôt know what the laws related to photography are. Maybe they aren‚Äôt allowed to share pictures taken of people in a private studio? Our surgeons, however, are incredibly good at what they do. I mean it. The patients that come in look completely different once they come out a few days later. They can do anything and everything, to a point where it‚Äôs almost... creepy? I‚Äôm talking facial surgery that leaves no scarring at all, entirely changing the face shape of a person. They do hair transplants that seem so natural, nobody would guess that it isn‚Äôt real. That‚Äôs not all they do, though. Jaw surgery, liposuction, you name it, the list goes on.



For example, a lady came in one afternoon, saying she had an appointment under the name of Stephanie with doctor Stevens. So as per the procedure, I hand her a form to fill in while I call the doctor to let him know that his next patient is here. I‚Äôm not sure what her appointment was for, since I never read people‚Äôs files. It felt disrespectful, like an invasion of privacy. I would technically be able to find out if I wanted, but that would involve snooping further into the system than I was allowed to. Stephanie was an average height, slim woman with short black hair. Her teeth were slightly crooked, but most people would never notice, too captivated by her deep green eyes. Doctor Stevens came to let her into the clinic and I went on with my day, welcoming in more clients for either one of the two businesses. I don‚Äôt usually remember patients, if I‚Äôm being honest, but I remembered her. I am a simple, twenty years old man, alright. When I see a beautiful woman, well, I remember her.



So, two days later, when a tall, redheaded woman came to my desk to check out of the clinic, I was astonished. There stood Stephanie, at least four inches taller than she originally was. Her hair reached her hips, and her skin now had freckles that I could swear she didn‚Äôt have before. My eyes observed every aspect of her new appearance until they landed on her teeth. They were perfectly straight. A weird feeling settled in the back of my lungs. Did she get fake teeth? I had no doubt that Doctor Stevens would be capable of doing such a realistic looking job, but still, it weirded me out. She looked at me with a tint of amusement in her eyes. Her eyes... they looked different. They were still green, but I promise I‚Äôm not kidding when I say that they were a completely different shade. You know that cartoonish green ‚Äútoxic liquid‚Äù color? It was exactly like that. I thought I was mistaken. There was no way she could be the same Stephanie, but no, she was the same woman from two days ago. There was no doubt, such was confirmed when her information perfectly matched the one written in the computer system.



That stayed with me for a while after, honestly. I‚Äôm not the most knowledgeable when it comes to science, but that seemed impossible to me. I mean, changing eye colors like that... and height? Still, I tried not to think about it too much. The surgeons are the professionals, I‚Äôm just the receptionist, I need to mind my business. Part of me didn‚Äôt want to ask questions, afraid that I would be fired and without a source of income. So what if I didn‚Äôt understand the lengths of surgery? I brushed the doubt out of my mind and kept on working as usual.



A few weeks later, I welcomed in a gorgeous young woman. I‚Äôm talking long black hair, beautiful brown eyes decorated with flawless makeup, and a figure that would make everyone in the room notice her. I wondered if she was a model.



‚ÄúWelcome in! What can I help you with today?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúHi! I‚Äôm here for my photoshoot. It‚Äôs under the name of Ella.‚Äù she replied with a smile, her shiny white teeth contrasting with her black lipstick.



I handed her a form to fill and told her that her photographer would be with her soon, gesturing towards the waiting area of the hall. Ella took the document and looked at me, her expression changing slightly.



‚ÄúAre you sure you don‚Äôt need my phone number?‚Äù she said with a glint in her eyes.



‚ÄúWe already have it in our files, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù I responded.



She tapped on my desk with her fingers, smiling playfully. She chuckled, took a pen and wrote her number on a small piece of paper I had on my desk. She then winked and walked away, before taking a seat and beginning to fill out her form. I wasn‚Äôt used to being flirted with at work. Most people‚Äôs minds were entirely focused on their appointment. I must have looked really stupid, because I don‚Äôt even remember responding. I‚Äôm pretty sure I just stared at her with my mouth slightly open, trying to formulate a response. I stood there like an idiot for an embarrassingly long moment, before shaking my head and picking up the phone to call in the photographer. A few minutes later, Ella was brought in the studio. As she walked past my desk, she winked at me again. I smiled at her and put her number in my pocket.



Part of me thought this was ridiculous. This is my workplace, not a middle-school classroom, but still, I couldn‚Äôt help but hope that something good would come of it. I wasn‚Äôt the social type, I still am not. I don‚Äôt go to bars, nor go to parties, so I don‚Äôt usually end up with a woman‚Äôs phone number. God, this is embarrassing to admit.



The day got pretty busy. It seemed like it would never calm down, but sure enough, less and less people started coming in, giving me time to clean up and close the hall for the night. I was mindlessly sweeping the floor, simply relieved that the day was over, when my mind started to wonder. I hadn‚Äôt seen Ella leave the building after her appointment. I had really wanted to make up for the first impression she got of me. I wanted to wish her a good evening, at least, maybe even invite her to go out for coffee together. I let out a sigh. Sure, it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal, but I was still disappointed. What if she changed her mind about me? I rolled my eyes, then kept cleaning.



After I finally left, I pulled the note out of my pocket and sent Ella a text. It simply said: ‚ÄúHey! It‚Äôs Zach, the receptionist. I thought I would see you again after your photoshoot, but I must‚Äôve missed you.‚Äù I put my phone back into my pocket and started walking back home. The lights coming from other parts of the building still illuminated the streets around it. It was always like this. Some employees left much later than I did, despite the reception closing at 9pm. It seemed weird to me, but again, I assumed they probably had paperwork to fill and whatnot. It‚Äôs hard to know what has to be done in a plastic surgery clinic after closing time when you don‚Äôt work in there.



I got home, ate something, then took a shower. After all this, I settled in bed. For once, I felt happy. I felt hopeful. Honestly, I couldn‚Äôt stop glancing at my phone to see if Ella had responded, but she hadn‚Äôt. She didn‚Äôt reply that night, nor the day after. Days passed without a response and I assumed she changed her mind. I was disappointed, I admit, but it happens. It wasn‚Äôt the end of the world. I got busy at work again, and I quickly stopped thinking about her. Despite my job technically being monotonous, little interactions here and there with people made each day a little bit different from the other, which I appreciated.



This morning, something happened that truly freaked me out. The day had been boring, nothing out of the ordinary or truly interesting happened. I was taking a sip of my coffee, when a woman made her way around my desk and stood in front of me.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to check out!‚Äù she said happily.



My coffee caught in my throat and I had to try really hard to keep it from coming back up. I swallowed, feeling the liquid slowly, painfully go down my throat. The woman... She looked like Ella. Not exactly like her, no, some of her features were different. She was shorter and her smile was entirely different, but she undeniably looked eerily similar to her.



‚ÄúSure thing. Under what name?‚Äù I finally asked, hoping the woman standing in front of me *would* somehow be Ella.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs under the name of Sophie. I came in a few days ago for a my surgeries.‚Äù she answered.



My breath caught in my throat. I looked her up in the system and, sure enough, a short blonde woman with light blue eyes had come in four days ago. Except, Sophie wasn‚Äôt blonde anymore. Her hair was long and black, and her eyes were now a deep shade of brown that I hadn‚Äôt been able to forget the sight of since I last saw them on Ella‚Äôs face a week ago. I held my breath, trying to push down the wave of nausea that was dangerously making its way up my throat. As soon as she left, I fell to the floor, bent over the trash can, and I threw up. It was undeniable. For fuck‚Äôs sake, those eyes *were* Ella‚Äôs eyes! That hair was *her* hair! But they were on a completely different woman. That made no sense! I stayed on the floor for a while longer, clutching my stomach, heavy breathing. Fortunately, nobody else came in that night. I didn‚Äôt even clean the hall. I locked the front door and I left. I don‚Äôt even think I turned off the lights. I ran home as fast as I could.



I‚Äôm in bed now and I can barely breathe. I sent an embarrassing amount of texts to Ella‚Äôs number, begging her to respond, to say anything, but she isn‚Äôt responding. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know what to do! Typing this all down was harder than I thought it would be. I‚Äôm trying to be rational, I swear, but how can I make sense of this? The new eyes, the new teeth, all those new features people come out with after their surgeries, they have to come from somewhere, right? Just... Please, help me make sense of this. I swear, I‚Äôm not crazy, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that something could have happened to Ella. If you have any idea, any rational explanation, anything, please tell me.",6,1754958614.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

The tires of the van ground against gravel like teeth. Pine trees loomed on either side of the winding forest road, tall and rigid, shrouded in mist as though they were watching. Jules adjusted the mic gain on his recorder, its blinking red light the only pulse in the silence. Beside him, Kay stared out the window, her hands clenched in her hoodie sleeves, quiet as frost.

They were a team again. Sort of. *CTRL+ALT+SCREAM* had lost traction in recent months‚Äîloud opinions, messy breakups, an audience that liked horror but not heartbreak. Red Pines was the hail mary: a cursed cabin documented in only whispers, a ritual site for a long-dead cult. Urban legend gold.

Behind them, Marcus rehearsed opening lines in a tone of smug reverence. Toni leaned into Deacon, her mic boom swaying like a pendulum between them.

‚ÄúThree days,‚Äù Jules said, not looking at Kay. ‚ÄúThree mics. One story.‚Äù

Kay replied, her voice barely audible. ‚ÄúUnless it eats us first.‚Äù

When they arrived, the cabin looked smaller than expected. Weather-worn. Half-swallowed by needles and moss. One window was boarded shut. The antlers nailed to the front gable still had marrow clinging to them.

Inside, it smelled of cedar, sweat, and something ancient. Jules hit record.

2

The first night was tame. Cameras set. Generators running. Marcus cracked jokes about ghost sex and ‚Äúcult cosplay.‚Äù But something felt off. Kay kept losing focus, her eyes drifting toward the attic door that hadn‚Äôt been opened. Toni complained of headaches. Deacon found a Polaroid under the rug‚Äîtwo lovers embracing, faces gouged beyond recognition, the words *He Felt Too Much* etched on the back.

That was when Kay found the journal.

Its leather cover peeled like skin. Inside, a former cult member named Irene detailed rituals tied to extreme emotion‚Äîrage, joy, devastation. The Hollow Heart believed feelings could be harvested through recording. ‚ÄúCapture the moment. Sacrifice the recorder. Become permanent,‚Äù one entry read.

They laughed, nervously. Then Marcus‚Äôs voice glitched in playback‚Äîsounding like someone else. Someone older. Broken.

That night, Jules couldn‚Äôt sleep. He climbed to the attic, mic dangling at his side. Kay followed. The space felt tighter than before, full of dust and something watching.

‚ÄúI never stopped wanting you,‚Äù Jules said, eyes shining in the half-light.

She kissed him, frantic, layered in years of silence. They collapsed against warped beams, breath tangling, fingers searching. In the corner, an old tape recorder began to hum.

Outside, the pines shivered. A skull fell from the rafters.

The cabin had started listening.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

3

Morning arrived like a bruise‚Äîquiet and ugly. Toni didn‚Äôt come down for coffee. Deacon found her in the bathtub, fully clothed, her eyes missing and replaced with dark coins. Lipstick rituals scrawled across porcelain. She rocked and whispered.

‚ÄúNo feeling is wasted. No love is wasted. No scream is wasted.‚Äù

Marcus filmed everything‚Äîhis lens trembling, pupils dilated like he was already drunk on dread.

Kay vomited outside while Jules replayed footage from the attic. What they‚Äôd recorded last night had changed. There were additional moans. A faint sound of hoofbeats. Kay‚Äôs laugh overlapped with a woman‚Äôs sobbing.

Deacon tried to leave.

The basement swallowed him instead.

They found his body strung from the ceiling like a warning sign‚Äîhis organs arranged in a spiral, with a recorder placed delicately in the center. When played, it whispered his name on loop.

*‚ÄúDeacon. Deacon. Deacon. We took the pieces. He took too little.‚Äù*

Marcus stopped laughing. He began humming the tune Toni had muttered. Then he whispered, ‚ÄúThey want something true. Real. They‚Äôre hungry for heartbreak.‚Äù

Jules began to understand.

This wasn‚Äôt just a haunted cabin.

It was a story‚Ä¶ waiting to finish itself.



4

Kay couldn‚Äôt stop trembling. Deacon‚Äôs remains had soaked through the floorboards, leaving slick spirals that hadn‚Äôt dried. Toni hadn‚Äôt spoken since her self-mutilation‚Äîjust rocked in place, whispering nonsense.

Jules set up a backup mic beside the fireplace. *‚ÄúWe document until it breaks us,‚Äù* he muttered.

Marcus had grown quiet, watching everyone with unsettling calm. Later, Jules found him in the cabin‚Äôs crawlspace, piecing together a face from scraps of old clothing and animal hide. Antlers dangled from his belt.

‚ÄúYou get it now, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù Marcus said. ‚ÄúThey told me. In the static. You have to wear truth. It‚Äôs the only way through.‚Äù

He attacked Toni before sunrise‚Äîknife drawn, body trembling with feverish joy. She screamed, not out of fear, but as if her soul was tearing loose. Marcus wore her blood like warpaint, declaring himself the ‚ÄúArchivist.‚Äù

Kay and Jules fought him off and dragged his broken body outside, but the forest wouldn‚Äôt let them leave it behind. Every path led back. The cabin wouldn‚Äôt let go.

And the faces Marcus had stitched? They began to whisper.

5

The journal Kay found yielded more secrets.

It wasn‚Äôt just a cult‚Äîit was a system. The Hollow Heart was an order of archivists who believed emotion was sacred currency. Pain could preserve identity. Lust fed the woods. Love... was the most unstable offering, the one that often ‚Äúoverwrote‚Äù the cabin itself.

One entry:

*‚ÄúRecord it. Relive it. Render it. Offer it. You must bleed what you love. Otherwise, it rots and returns.‚Äù*

Jules began experiencing blackouts. His voice changed on recordings. Mic distortion layered in phrases he never said.

Kay kissed him again that night‚Äînot in desperation, but in defiance.

Their love was jagged, raw. The cabin pulsed beneath them, lights dimming, floor groaning with pleasure or protest.

Then came the mirror shift.

Jules watched Kay walk past, but her reflection didn‚Äôt match. It was crying. Bleeding from the mouth.

Their own memories were being rewritten.

They weren't documenting horror anymore.

They were *becoming it.*

6

They found it hidden behind the fireplace: a sealed door carved with overlapping names and dates‚Äîsome centuries old, some from earlier that week.

Jules kicked through the boards.

Inside lay the Ritual Room.

The walls were lined with reel-to-reel recorders. Cassette tapes dripped resin. In the center, a slab of pine engraved with the phrase:

*‚ÄúTo scream is to feed. To love is to end.‚Äù*

They couldn‚Äôt stop themselves. Kay and Jules approached the altar. Her palm met his. Their old podcast audio played softly in the background‚Äîthe happy banter, the heartbreak episodes, the long silences after they split.

Suddenly, Kay felt it: the cabin wasn't hungry for their fear.

It wanted their past.

A ritual knife was already placed on the slab.

Jules whispered, ‚ÄúWe either offer what was... or become what comes next.‚Äù

They kissed again‚Äîslowly, painfully, filled with grief. Kay‚Äôs tears mixed with pine sap.

The cabin shuddered.

And below, something ancient blinked awake.



7

They buried Marcus again‚Äîor thought they did.

But at dawn, he was back. Same stitched face. Same murmured phrases. Except this Marcus hadn‚Äôt died yet. His wounds were reversed. Fresh skin over old scars.

Kay screamed. Jules checked the tapes. Every recording from the past two days was different now‚Äîsame moments, new outcomes. Toni wasn‚Äôt dead in one. In another, Kay stabbed Jules before the altar kiss.

The cabin was collapsing timelines, forcing the crew to live every version of themselves.

Jules tried to run. He made it halfway down the mountain before he hit the invisible border. Static burst from his chest like he‚Äôd swallowed electricity. He awoke back in bed.

Kay kissed him good morning, like none of it had happened.

But her eyes flickered.

They were stuck in the *scream-loop*.



8

Jules confronted Marcus, this time in a version where the cabin was empty and snow covered the floor. Marcus sat cross-legged, humming the podcast‚Äôs original intro theme.

‚ÄúDo you get it yet?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not documenting horror. You‚Äôre editing legacy.‚Äù

Kay found a locked drawer behind the altar: inside, a cassette labeled *‚ÄúCTRL+ALT+SCREAM‚ÄîFinal Cut.‚Äù* It wasn‚Äôt theirs. Not exactly.

Jules played it.

His own voice‚Äîunfiltered, raw‚Äîconfessed to ritualizing the show from the start. Each heartbreak episode wasn‚Äôt just real‚Ä¶ it *bled.*

*‚ÄúEvery story fed the cabin. We recorded grief. We planted roots.‚Äù*

The tape ended with a new name: Jules, now dubbed the Final Archivist.

His nose bled. The reels spun backward. And behind the Ritual Room wall, a second altar appeared‚Äîmade of bone.



9

They had one choice left.

Document the final ritual.

Jules lay on the bone altar, Kay holding the mic, voice shaking.

*‚ÄúHe said we don‚Äôt die here. We just change shape.‚Äù*

With each word, the cabin responded‚Äîwalls warping, air thick with memory.

Jules offered himself fully: his pain, his past, his love for Kay. Not sanitized. Not scripted. Raw.

The cabin screamed.

Antlers burst through the floor. The pine walls wept resin. Old voices‚ÄîDeacon, Toni, the original cult‚Äîchanted in reverse.

Kay kissed Jules‚Äôs hand and hit ‚ÄúStop Recording.‚Äù

And silence fell.

She walked out, alone.

Outside, the sun rose. The cabin didn‚Äôt follow.

But in the last tape she saved, Jules spoke:

*‚ÄúRed Pines isn‚Äôt haunted. It‚Äôs archived. And someone always hits play.‚Äù*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

*10*

The forest was quiet. Too quiet.

Kay wandered the border alone, carrying Jules‚Äôs final tape in her pocket like a talisman. She hadn‚Äôt slept, hadn‚Äôt spoken. The wind carried whispers. Sometimes she heard her own laugh. Sometimes Jules‚Äôs final breath.

She found a clearing filled with dead microphones‚Äîhundreds, mounted on poles, red blinking lights all pointing at her. A shrine of failed recordings.

She played the tape.

*‚ÄúRed Pines isn‚Äôt haunted. It‚Äôs archived.‚Äù*

The moment she hit play, the cabin reappeared behind her‚Äîreformed in seconds. Wood groaned. Antlers reassembled.

And inside... was *her voice* narrating someone else‚Äôs grief.

11

Weeks later, Kay returned to civilization. The tape had corrupted her mic‚Äîuploaded six hours of content she didn‚Äôt remember recording. The podcast feed lit up again, followers multiplying.

Her new episodes weren‚Äôt interviews.

They were confessions.

She told the world about Jules. About the Hollow Heart. About the scream-loop. Media swarmed. A documentary crew begged for access. Paranormal hunters made pilgrimage.

Red Pines fed on every mention.

Every download bled.

And soon, Kay realized‚Äîshe was becoming a conduit. Her voice distorted. Her dreams weren‚Äôt hers.

She stopped recording.

But the feed didn‚Äôt.

12

Kay returned one last time, dragging gasoline and salt.

Inside the cabin, everything had changed. Faces moved in the walls. Toni‚Äôs voice played through the windchimes. Deacon‚Äôs bones lined the fireplace like trophies.

The bone altar was cracked‚Äîbut growing.

Cult symbols layered over her own podcast logo.

She lit the first match.

But before the flames took, she saw Jules.

Whole. Smiling.

Or not him.

‚ÄúYou came back. I‚Äôm proud.‚Äù

She blinked, and he was gone. But his voice bled through the fire.

She screamed.

The cabin screamed louder.

13

The blaze drew others.

Cultists emerged‚Äîdescendants of the Hollow Heart. Not believers, but technicians. Archivists. Their robes woven from mic cables and cassette tape. One wore Marcus‚Äôs stitched face.

They recorded.

‚ÄúShe completes the ritual,‚Äù said one.

‚ÄúShe rewrites the scream,‚Äù said another.

Kay stood in the flames, eyes wild.

‚ÄúNo more loops. No more story.‚Äù

She offered her final tape to the altar, untouched by fire.

It hissed. Spoke. Begged.

And then, silence.

The cabin collapsed.

The forest wept.

The pine trees began to *bloom*.

A year passed.

Kay disappeared. No one knew where.

The podcast remained active. New episodes appeared monthly‚Äîsometimes just whispers, sometimes distorted screams, sometimes memories that never happened.

Fans claimed they saw Jules in their dreams.

Others claimed Red Pines had regrown in multiple forests worldwide‚Äîeach with its own cabin, its own bone altar.

Hollow Heart was never a cult.

It was a *format*.

And pain was the codec.

A stranger hikes into a new forest.

Finds a cabin.

Boards creak. Antlers sway.

Inside is a cassette marked *CTRL+ALT+SCREAM: Season Two*

They press play.

Jules‚Äôs voice returns.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a listener. You‚Äôre the next recorder. Welcome home.‚Äù*

The stranger smiles.

They hit record.

And the pines drink deep again.

Way darker than the rest till now. Not just in plot, but in tone ‚Äî even my beloved early-00s rock soundtrack is gone. This episode proves we don‚Äôt need meteor freaks. The scariest villain so far? 100% human.

>!Detective Phelan is a crooked cop who sees Clark stopping a bus. !<

>!Instead of calling him out, he corners him with a chilling deal: work for me, or I expose you. You see Clark struggle; he wants to do the right thing. !<

>!But every move backfires. Every ‚Äúno‚Äù just makes Phelan push harder. And Clark can‚Äôt exactly run to the cops when the problem *is* the cops.!<

So it‚Äôs not about superpowers this time. It‚Äôs about control.

Phelan knows he has it. Clark thinks he can take it back‚Ä¶ but he‚Äôs too confident on a field he‚Äôs never played in.

First time he learns that choices have real consequences ‚Äî and they can hurt.

*‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you get for trying to be a hero.‚Äù*

Then it escalates. Phelan frames Jonathan. Full-on gets him arrested to squeeze Clark.

Seeing Jonathan in handcuffs hits different. And for a moment, Clark almost crosses the line.

But Jonathan, even in jail, knows how to teach his son:

*‚ÄúYou always have a choice, son.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúBut you didn‚Äôt, right?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWhen you cross that line‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no going back.‚Äù*

Meanwhile... Lex is Lex ‚Äî suspicious, helpful, and sneaky all at once.

*""Give me 5 minutes and I‚Äôll give you the 10 best lawyers.‚Äù*

While working behind Clark‚Äôs back to get to know his secret.

And then Lana/Chloe's slow-burning drama: While Clark‚Äôs drowning in blackmail and betrayal, the Torch drama blows up.

Chloe gets replaced at *her* paper by Lana ‚Äî courtesy of the principal. Being replaced by Lana at the Torch *and* in Clark‚Äôs life? Brutal. And that final Chloe‚ÄìLana scene is quiet but cuts deep:

*‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the only thing Clark and I have together.‚Äù*

No doubts now. Chloe no longer wants to be just ‚Äúthe friend.‚Äù Her feelings are out there now, and her fear of being invisible is growing.

Lana‚Äôs blindsided ‚Äî she doesn‚Äôt want to be the villain here, but she‚Äôs part of the problem anyway. And I'll say that by her thoughts and actions, Lana is already more into Clark than her boyfriend.

**Final thoughts:**

This episode redefines ‚Äúvillain‚Äù in *t*his show.

Clark learns saving people isn‚Äôt just about strength ‚Äî it‚Äôs sacrifice, silence, and strategy. And it leaves you with a question. If doing the right thing hurts the people you love‚Ä¶ do you still do it?

**What if Clark hadn‚Äôt double-crossed Phelan on the first time and Phelan had gotten away with it?**

**What if Phelan hadn‚Äôt died in the museum? Would Clark be exposed, or submitted again to blackmail?**

**Would Clark have gone down a much darker path?**

***Those answers (or script deviations...) I'll give it to your thoughts/opinions.***

1mntrxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/WereJustFriends/comments/1mntrxu/wickedly_beautiful_summer/,Wickedly Beautiful Summer,"
There are nights I replay in my mind like scenes from a novel I never got to finish, moments threaded with laughter, glances, and the kind of tension that lingers long after the lights go out. Nights I wish I‚Äôd been braver. Bolder with my heart.

We‚Äôd spent countless evenings together, sometimes wrapped in the noise of our friends, sometimes just the two of us, sitting quietly in the orbit of each other's gravity. But there were a few nights I cant forget.

One evening last summer, I was invited out for drinks with friends. I was late getting back to town, so I arrived late. You were already there, sitting with your son, fresh off a day on the golf course and with a drink in hand and you shot me that smile that always unraveled me a little. As I sat down, you leaned in and said 

‚Äúmy god, you‚Äôre beautiful.‚Äù
And then, as if it needed repeating, again: ‚ÄúSeriously. You‚Äôre‚Ä¶so beautiful.‚Äù

The words clung to the air like smoke, slow, delicate, curling into the corners of me that hadn‚Äôt been touched in a long time. I laughed it off, unsure what to do with the warmth spreading through my chest or the way your eyes lingered just a moment too long.

Later, amid the chatter of the group, I wanted to point out something happening across the room. My hand brushed your upper thigh (a soft, unintentional graze) and before I could stammer out an apology, you turned to me, smirking.
‚ÄúCareful,‚Äù you said, your voice low, teasing eyes playful. ‚ÄúYou almost touched it.‚Äù
My face went hot. I laughed awkwardly, tripping over a half-formed apology as heat rose to my cheeks. Our friends confused by what was said in our side conversation, but you didn‚Äôt pull away. You just smiled and kept laughing, stealing glances, like the moment meant nothing. 

Or maybe it meant everything.

We moved through the evening like we always did, subtle glances, fingertips brushing, gentley stroking forarms, words unspoken. A stranger with a dog passed by us and while we were loving on the dog she asked, ‚ÄúAre you two together?‚Äù
I started to answer, but you beat me to it.
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù you said, and I echoed you a second too late.
‚ÄúWell,‚Äù the stranger added with a smile, ‚Äúyou two look good together, think about it.‚Äù
You glanced at me, amused. I laughed, but inside‚Ä¶ I wondered. Was the universe trying to show us something? Was that what everyone else saw, this wasn't the first time we've heard this, is it something we were too afraid to name?

Just before we left, we were standing beside my sons friend Logan, he was asking questions and the conversation had shifted to marriage, he shared he was excited to get married the following weekend. We joked about not doing it, do t do it, You laughed and said you were ‚Äúworking on your third marriage, and gesturd in my direction.‚Äù I smiled, but inside, I paused.

Your third.

Were you referring to me?

I didn‚Äôt ask. I didn‚Äôt want to assume. But when I stepped aside to let someone pass and backed into you, your hands instinctively found my hips, steadying me. For a breath, we didn‚Äôt move.

We fit.

The realization landed with quiet certainty the shape of your body behind mine, the warmth, the way your hands hesitated before letting go. We fit in a way that didn't need words.

I wonder‚Ä¶ did you feel it too?

Am I your third?

But we were just friends. Right?

That night, alone in my bed, I couldn‚Äôt stop replaying it. The way your voice dipped when you called me beautiful. The teasing touch. The stranger‚Äôs knowing smile. The almost.

And I wondered‚Ä¶

What if I hadn‚Äôt laughed? What if I hadn‚Äôt apologized? What if, instead, I‚Äôd met your gaze and whispered, ‚ÄúMaybe I wanted to touch it.‚Äù Or smiled and said, ‚ÄúMaybe Im just trying to make a new friend.‚Äù

What if?

One night last fall, after bar-hopping and pizza with friends, you played with my hair to get my attention, and had your hand on the small of my back, almostthe entire night. It felt like we were a couple. 

But we tell everyone we're just friends, right?

We left there and walking up the street stopping just outside another favorite establishment. There was live music playing, the air sharp with autumn. Neither of us wanted to go home yet. We said goodnight to our friends, and found two empty seats at the bar and asked the bartender for their astrology book, because of course we did.

We laughed reading it together, flipping through the pages,  pretending the stars had all the answers. I read your birthday horoscope aloud, your arm slung around the back of my chair and my shoulders. I was nestled into you, drawn by your warmth more than the whiskey in my veins. Longing for more than just your arm and the familiar warmth wrapped around me.

Your neighbor struck up a conversation with you about learning they are having his first baby, and how parenting is the most amazing experience right. Somehow the conversation turned to body grooming, he asked if you shaved. I asked If I heard him correctly, you turned to me, sharing the conversation, with your neighbor, we laughed.
‚ÄúWell, do you groom?‚Äù I asked, raising a brow.
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù you said, your voice low almost a whisper but your eyes locked on mine. ‚ÄúI had to for my previous job, but don't now, and I don‚Äôt care what you have going on down there either, full bush, strip or bald,  Guys don‚Äôt care about that kind of thing, we just want in.‚Äù I said it will just have to be a surprise for you then.

There was heat in your gaze, a flicker of something deeper. I stared at your lips, wondering what they felt like. You leaned in closer, and tried to kiss me.

For a heartbeat, I almost let you.
But then, I turned away. Our faces almost touching, your breath, heavy on my neck. My breath in your ear.

My heart thudded, a tangle of nerves and fear and disbelief. I don‚Äôt know why I pulled back. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt ready. Maybe I was scared. But the moment shattered, and I felt it, the regret. Immediate and sharp. 

If only I could go back, if only.

A few weeks later out with the same friends, enjoying drinks, laughs and good company. You stealing my shot, with that devilsh grin. That night, you stepped away to use the restroom, kissing the back of my head as you passed behind me. 

One friend disappeared after dancing, and the other struggled to stand upright,and kept falling so we had to walk her home. 

After you secured the door of her apartment, you commented how you liked how I locked the door behind us. I said, I wanted to keep her safe. We began down the stairs, you offered your hand as I stepped down, and we held hands the entire six block walk back to my car. When we arrived, we turned to each other embracing fully, our arms around each others waist. Looking at each other, the moment was electric.  I stared into your eyes and probably lingered in your arms a little too long, when I desperately wanted to kiss you. I think you felt it too. You held me like you didn‚Äôt want to let go. Staring at me like you were trying to memorize me, or you had a thousand words to say to me. None of them coming out.  Me screaming inside ""just tell me how you feel about me.""

And again‚ÄîI did nothing.

A few weeks later after Oktoberfest. You invited me over for beers after everyone was starting to retreat back home, your hand was on the small of my back as I stood next to you. There was something softer in your voice, something hesitant. A tender look in your eye. I surveyed the group to see of anyone else heard the invite, realizing no one had, I said raincheck? I'm so tempted by you, don't trust myself alone with you.

I wonder what would‚Äôve happened if I‚Äôd said yes. If I‚Äôd followed you home. If we‚Äôd let the night stretch into something more.

Would things have been different?

Would we?

But, we're just friends, right?

I get lost in the idea of slipping into your arms, away from the world‚Äôs eyes, into something secret and sacred, it thrills me. There‚Äôs something wickedly beautiful about the fantasy. Something irresistible.
My mind wanders too easily: to your hands, your mouth, your breath and lips at my neck. To the quiet hush of a room where time stops. To the way it might feel to finally give in.

But then, my conscience speaks, and I ask myself, what if he doesn't feel the same?

And I pull back.

So I stay here‚Ä¶ suspended in this quiet ache. Wanting. Yearning.
Yearning for the warmth of your body against mine. Yearning for mornings rolling out of your bed wrapped in your T-shirt, barefoot in your kitchen, making you coffee like it‚Äôs the most natural thing in the world.

As if we were something real.

And I realize loving someone who belongs to someone else is a quiet torment, every smile they give feels like a gift not meant for you, and every moment without them echoes like a wound that never quite heals.

Because we're just friends right?

1mntnp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1mntnp1/tifu_by_composting/,TIFU by composting,"My family is still relatively new to composting, but after a successful garden last year, heavier reliance on produce this year, and plenty of backyard space to make compost piles, we've decided to keep a small bucket in our kitchen for composting. 

A while back my parents left for a work trip/vacation and the compost bucket was emptied of its goods and the liner on the inside. I did not compost while they were away because of this. I was under the impression that when there was a bag in the bucket, we could put scraps, coffee grounds, and other goodies inside.   
  
So, when they got back home a new bag was put into the compost bucket and I began to put things in there. It started with some peach pits, avocado skin, apple cores, the ends of a zucchini.... And before I knew it, there were at least 20 fruit flies on top of the bucket lid before I even opened it. This felt out of the ordinary, but I figured that we would take it out sooner or later because it usually fills up in less than a week. I also thought that the increase in fruit flies was due to our new fruit haul, as the flies always sneak in with the bananas and peaches. 

Well, a week went by and the flies hadn't gone away. The fruit pile had dwindled but the flies grew in number. To be honest, I have no idea how long its been, but I've seen more and more flies with each passing day. I've been sick recently so haven't paid much attention to the bucket anyways. Then today, while I was standing by the compost bucket talking to my sister, she commented on the amount of flies on the wall, cabinets, and surrounding fruits. ""Thats so odd.. I thought Mom said we weren't composting this week."" My heart skipped a beat. I had completely forgot to check how full the compost was, and if I was the only one putting things into it, then it was long past its regular takeout time. 

  
Before I could stop her, she lifted the lid to the compost bucket. All hell broke loose. A black cloud arose from the opening of the bucket. Flies went everywhere, we screamed, and I think I inhaled a few. Anywho, we eventually took out the compost, swatted at flies for a bit, and laughed it off. I tried and failed to kill them with cleaning spray. Its been a few hours but there are still groups of fruit flies everywhere. I've set up some fruit fly traps and drowned at least 20, but I swear they keep spawning out of thin air. No matter how many I smash they keep reappearing in the same spot. I went to swat at one and suddenly there were three others taunting me. There are five pestering me as I type this. They have managed to spread from the kitchen to every other room in the house. I will never neglect the compost again. 

TL;DR: I put food into the compost bucket under the impression we were composting, but the bucket was neglected for a few weeks. Now we have a nightmare fruit fly colony in our house. Don't be like me- take out the compost before the flies find out about it. ",2,1754957269.0,tifu,0,0.67,False

My fork hit the plate with a loud clank. I slowly finished chewing my bite, swallowed hard, and then uttered, 

""...What?""

*Fuck.* The scale‚Äîthe one that stuck to the wall in the bathroom when I flung it... I'd forgotten to pick it up. My throat tightened. 

""I know it must have freaked you out. But, they're for a model I've been working on.""

""A *model?* John... they felt *real.*‚Äù

""Well, thanks!"" he chuckled. ""I'm trying to make them as lifelike as possible.""

I was still extremely skeptical. 

""Why were they in your shaving kit, though?""

""They weren't finished curing, and I didn't want them to get messed up. So, I just tucked them into there.""

It seemed like a strange choice to me, but conceivable, I suppose. John was a very smart man, though sometimes his logic and reasoning on certain things differed drastically from my own. Maybe he thought doing that would protect them from dust particles or something. 

""*Okay...* well... what about the salt?"" I asked, deciding to just go for it now that the lines of communication had been opened. 

""The salt?"" he asked, raising an eyebrow. 

I chose my words carefully. 

""Yes. When I kissed you the other day, your skin tasted salty. And, the cinnamon rolls you made? They were covered in salt. I had to throw them all away.""

He paused for a moment, took a deep breath, then looked down at his plate. 

""I sweat a lot, Sonia. You know I've been working out more lately, too. I got up extra early and went for a run before I made those. *God,* I'm embarrassed now."" 

""So, what about last night in bed? Are you going to try to tell me *that* was just sweat, too?""

My heart flopped in my chest as soon as the words had left my mouth. He looked back up at me, and his eyes softened.

""*Yes...* I was having a nightmare. *Oh, Sonia,* it was awful. And it felt so real.""

""Wait, I don't understand,"" I said, scrunching my eyebrows at him. ""Why did you say you were wet from the shower, then?""

""Because that's what happened in my dream. I was being drowned in the bathtub by some unseen force.""

He broke his gaze from me to turn and set his plate down on the coffee table in front of us before continuing. 

""Whatever it was, I couldn't see it; I could only feel it. All I really remember is that I was lying in the bathtub, unable to move, while it held my face down under the shower head. So, when I woke up drenched and struggling to breathe, I thought it had really happened‚Äîthat I'd somehow escaped and reached the bed. I tried to wake you up to help me, but... you freaked out. And I was still so disoriented. It didn't hit me that it was just a dream until you said I was scaring you. By then, you were so upset all I could do was say sorry and go sleep on the couch. But that's why I got off work early today. I wanted to make your favorite dish and apologize.""

He reached out his hand and gently grabbed ahold of mine. It all seemed so bizarre. But, at the same time, just plausible enough to stop me in my tracks and force me to recalibrate. I didn't understand how a person could possibly sweat that much, though. I mean, I know hyperhidrosis is a thing, but I had no idea that it could present to such a degree. Or, maybe he actually *had* started sleepwalking and almost drowned himself. Either way, I felt bad. I realized I'd been so stuck in my own head that whole time. I hadn't even considered how *he* might have been feeling. 

Flipping around the perspective, it would actually be *me* who looked like the irrational one. Throwing away the apology cinnamon rolls and crumpling up the note, screaming at him in bed and acting like he was a monster, sneaking around and collecting model fish scales to have them tested... *God.* No wonder they couldn't be identified. I felt absolutely ridiculous.

He told me he'd just been really stressed about this new project at work. Evidently, it was making him irritable and manifesting itself in other strange ways, too. I accepted his apology and his explanations, then told him I was sorry, too, for how I'd reacted to things. We finished our meal and the episode of Deadliest Catch in silence. Then, John took my plate and told me not to worry about the dishes; he'd have them washed and put away by the time I got out of the shower. 

The bathroom was spotless. His shaving kit wasn't out, and the tub looked pristine, like it had been scrubbed clean and polished. It looked better than it did when we moved in. I smiled. It seemed like he was truly making a concerted effort to set things right between us.

As I exited the bathroom in my robe, he came running down the hallway like a toddler, gleefully shouting,

""My turn!!""

I chuckled and rolled my eyes, then went off to bed to wait for him. He stayed in the bathroom showering for a long time; the sound of running water felt endless. When he finally emerged, he immediately crawled into bed with me and scooted his body close to mine, putting his arm around me and pulling me into an embrace. He was warm again. He felt like *John* again. I closed my eyes as he leaned in and whispered,

""I love you, Sonia.""

I told him I loved him, too. He gently kissed my cheek, then asked,

""You wanna *spawn?*"" 

My eyes popped open, and I slowly turned my face to see his big, cheesy smile looming over me. I let out a weak, nervous laugh, and he winked. It was just a joke, albeit a poorly timed one. But still on par with John's typical goofy sense of humor, I thought. The tension in my body began to fade away as he started running his hands softly across my skin. We made love passionately that night. It felt the way it did when we had first gotten together, like all the magic between us was still very much alive. I peacefully drifted off to sleep in his arms, with my mind finally at ease. 

For a while, it truly seemed like I had gotten him back. The more normal he acted, the more I convinced myself I'd just been overreacting that entire time. No more yelling or violent outbursts.¬† On the contrary, he seemed to be in a great mood all the time. The John from our college years suddenly seemed to resurface‚Äîthe version that had won me over. He was kind, so affectionate, and more attentive than he'd been in years. It felt like he was courting me all over again. 

Because of this, I doubted my own judgment and perception. I swallowed all of my suspicions and stopped digging around and asking questions. I ignored the faint scent of putrid decay coming from the bathroom, telling myself it must be an issue with our septic system. I lathered tons of lotion on my increasingly drying skin and chalked it up to winter. But the most foolish thing I did? I allowed my heart to lure my mind into believing the thing I wanted so desperately to be true. 

By the next week, I'd almost forgotten about the whole thing. Then, one morning, everything changed. We were at the front door, grabbing our things from the coat closet and getting ready to leave for work. I looked down and caught a glimpse of something odd. Something that didn't belong. Something *fishy*. Lying just within view, sitting inconspicuously on the sole of his shoe, was a single strand of seaweed.

As I quickly inspected it, my heart sank. *No...* It wasn't one of those dried seaweed snacks they sell at the Asian market. It looked slimy and wet‚Äîlike it had just been dragged up from the water. Portions of the roots were still attached. I only had about a half-second to process this information before he shoved his foot into the loafer. *Fuck.*

He walked me to my car and kissed me goodbye. With clenched teeth, I forced a smile and drove away, looking at him through my rearview mirror. He stood there in the driveway and watched my car until I began to turn left at the stop sign at the end of our street. As soon as I was out of his sight, I punched hard on the gas. 

*God dammit,* I thought, slamming my hand onto the top of the steering wheel. *Why?* Why did I have to see that? Why did it have to be there?? Things had finally started to feel normal again, and now this? *What the fuck?!* I drove to work in a silent state of panic, desperately trying to stop myself from spiraling. 

It's just a piece of seaweed, I told myself. It meant nothing. He could have been doing field research for the lab. *Hell,* there could be several perfectly rational explanations as to how it had gotten there. I mean, he was a marine biologist, and we lived in Bar Harbor, for Christ's sake. The ocean was five minutes from everywhere. It's not like seaweed was an uncommon thing to see around Maine. With as far as the tides drew back at the bay, it was practically expected. 

Things between us had been going so perfectly... better than they'd been in a while, actually. I couldn't let this one little strange sighting ruin all of that. I forced it to the back of my mind and tried to focus on my job. I had a report to finish on fishery management and my boss was asking for progress updates daily. As the day went on, though, my mind began to wander. During my lunch break, I started googling. 

*Symptoms of psychosis:*
-Hallucinations
-Delusions
-Confused and disturbed thoughts. 

Okay, *shit.* That sounded like it could possibly apply to me as much as it did to him. If I'm being honest, I wasn't entirely sure what was real and what I'd just been imagining. At that point, the only thing I was sure of was that either John was losing his mind or I was. I can confirm that I was definitely experiencing the *'confused and disturbed thoughts'* part, though. 

*Symptoms of a brain tumor:*
-Headaches

*Hmm...* That last symptom hit a little too close to home. I bit down on my bottom lip and hit the backspace button. Trying to diagnose him using WebMD would be impossible. It would also serve to further my paranoia, which was the last thing I needed at the time. I'd just have to keep watching him to see if any more symptoms appeared. 

I dug around in my Greek salad, chasing a Kalamata olive with my fork, when a thought came to me. I typed *'marine hatchetfish'* into the search bar. Living in depths of up to 4,000 feet, they looked about how you'd expect. Hideous little things with enormous bulging eyes, a downturned gaping mouth full of tiny sharp teeth, and a grotesquely misshaped body. I remember thinking how terrifying these creatures would be if they weren't small enough to fit inside a human palm.  

Its scales were silver and reflective, just like John's model scales looked. If John was making a model, why would he choose such an ugly specimen? Let alone one belonging to a genus that wasn't even remotely in his realm of studies. I suppose he could have taken a personal interest in this particular fish, but I still didn't understand why. So, I kept reading.

There are seven documented species of Argyropelegcus, otherwise known as silver hatchetfish. Each species differs slightly in size and range, but they all share a few common traits. They feed on prey like small crustaceans, shrimp, and fish larvae, which they hunt by migrating to the surface at night. They utilize their disproportionately large pupils to detect even the faintest traces of light. And, like many deep-sea fish, they possess bioluminescence. A set of tiny blue, glowing lights emitting from their underbellies act to mimic rippling sunlight, concealing them from predators below: a nifty little evolutionary trick referred to as counter-illumination. 

Not exactly groundbreaking stuff. But, I suppose I could see why John might have taken an interest in them. He'd always been particularly fascinated with bioluminescence, after all. I mean, you'd be hard-pressed to find a biologist who didn't at least agree that it was one of the most amazing natural phenomena to grace our planet. Maybe he was planning to attach tiny LED lights to his model. With it being almost December, maybe he'd been working on this as a Christmas gift for a colleague. Or, perhaps even an ornament for our tree? I hoped.

I slid my phone into my pocket and went back to work, determined to finish my report. At the very least, I needed to complete the first draft of it. I couldn't afford to let myself go overboard with obsessive thoughts over what was going on in John's mind. I had my own career to focus on... my *own* damn life to live, too, you know? I was able to power through the conclusion of my report by the end of that afternoon. Not my best work, I'll admit, but it was something to show my boss the next day.

John's vehicle was already in the driveway when I got home. I glanced over and noticed that the gate to the backyard was open, and the hose was trailing around the corner of the house from the front spigot. But I didn't think much of it at that moment. I walked inside and saw his field bag lying on the floor in front of the coat closet. None of the lights had been turned on, and the TV was off. 

""John?"" 

No answer. I set my bag down on the floor next to his, then made my way to the kitchen. His keys and pocket change were sitting atop the island, but other than that, the room was exactly as we'd left it that morning. I thought back to the hose. Maybe he's gardening out in the backyard? Wait, in mid-November? *No, Sonia‚Äîget it together!* My persistent urge to explain away odd behaviors in order to maintain the status quo had begun to seriously damage my inductive reasoning skills. 

My search for him had to be put on pause, however, at the request of my bladder. I shuffled to the bathroom, flipped on the light, and hurried to the toilet to relieve myself. I flushed, washed my hands, then shut off the faucet. When I did, I could suddenly hear a drip coming from the bathtub. But it wasn't the *'plop'* sound that water makes when it hits a dry surface. It was the *'plunk... plunk... plunk...'* you hear when it's dripping into more water below. 

My blood ran cold, and my hand began to tremble as I slowly reached out toward the shower curtain. I quickly forced in a deep breath. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Then, I ripped the curtain back. There was John. He was just lying there, fully submerged and motionless, eyes closed and arms folded across his chest. Large chunks of ice floated in the water surrounding his body. My heart stopped. I fell to my knees, screamed his name, and threw my arms out to grab him from the water. Then... his eyes popped open.

His pupils were two enormous pools of blackness, covering almost the entire diameter of his iris. For a second, I froze; he was looking at me so intensely that it felt like his gaze directly pierced into the depths of my soul. Then, he blinked, releasing me from his trance. I fell backward and immediately started scrambling to secure a foothold on the fuzzy mat beneath me. As I tried desperately to stand back up, John's body began to slowly rise from the water. He then turned his face to look at me, and the corners of his mouth started to recede into a smile before he uttered,

""Hey, Sonia! Did I scare you?""

I blinked a few times, mouth hanging open like a bass, completely dumbfounded by the audacity of this question. I took a few seconds to catch my breath while I stared at him. Then, the visceral reaction I'd internalized suddenly bubbled over and erupted to the surface. 

""*JOHN!!!*"" I shrieked, and my voice began to break. ""I thought you were fucking *DEAD!!*""

He laughed. 

""Oh, wow, Sonia‚Äîthat's dramatic. I'm just doing a cold plunge!""

I rose to my feet, still in shock and trying to choke back the tears that had begun to flood my eyes. 

""...*What?!*""

He stepped out of the tub and began toweling himself off. 

""A cold plunge! Howard from work told me it would help me go harder on my workouts. It actually feels great; you should try it!"" he said. 

""*Fully clothed?!*"" I yelled.

""Well, yeah, Sonia... that's how you do it. You don't get naked like it's a regular bath,"" he giggled. 

I just stared at him blankly until that stupid smile had left his face. 

""Are you okay?"" he asked. ""Jeez, I had no idea that it would actually frighten you. I'm sorry.""

I wasn't sure if I believed him or not, but that wasn't my focus at the time. There was an intense rage simmering inside of me. I wanted to scream and cry and beat my fists against his chest. How could he be so dismissive? So callus? But I knew at that moment trying to convey those feelings to him would do no good. Neither would it be to continue to question him. 

""It's fine,"" I said. 

It most certainly was not fine, but I didn't want him to think otherwise. The panic hadn't yet left my body, and with it came a type of calculated behavior I can only attribute to pure survival instinct. I allowed him to think I'd gotten over it and started dinner. 

It was a Tuesday, so I was making tacos. Clich√©, I know. But it was just one of my things. After he'd dried himself off and changed clothes, he came into the kitchen and sat down at the island. I didn't turn around to look at him; I just kept stirring the ground beef in the pan. 

""You know,"" he said, ""I've been craving seafood lately."" 

I froze in place, gripping tightly onto the wooden spoon. 

""Maybe next Tuesday we can have fish tacos. Or later this week, we could try shrimp scampi?"" he continued.

It took everything in me not to react, but I resumed stirring and replied,

""Yeah, sure. That sounds good. I can look up some recipes."" 

John had never asked for seafood before. He'd eat it if offered, but it was never one of his favorites. Was he testing me? If so, I hoped I passed. We ate, watched TV, and then I went to the bathroom to shower. This was my chance. I turned on the faucet in the bathtub, locked the door, and then went straight for his shaving kit on the counter. 

My heart was pounding out of my chest as I unzipped the kit, being extremely careful not to disturb whatever contents were concealed inside. And yes, I found exactly what I feared I'd find. More scales. A lot of them. Silvery, delicate, but this time... dried. And horrifyingly, they were speckled with tiny red drops of what looked like blood. I leaned in closer and pulled out my phone to start taking pictures. When I zoomed in, I noticed that attached to the inner edge of each scale was a half-ring of beige-colored tissue. Flesh. It was *human* flesh. 

*Motherfucker.* I dropped my phone and gripped the counter to steady myself, but the room was already spinning. I had to keep breathing... I had to move... I had to turn off the water. I ran over to the bathtub and shut it off right before it overflowed. Dark spots began to appear in my line of vision, and the blood drained from my face as an overwhelming wave of dizziness swept over my body. Fearing I was going to pass out, I lowered myself down onto the floor beside the tub and focused on the ripples in the water, trying to ground myself. 

The mystery white sediment had come back, lining every corner and crack of the tub. Little chunks of it were floating all over the surface. *What the hell?* How could it have come back so quickly? And so much?? I reached out and plucked the nearest chunk from the water. It was soft and started to crumble at the edges. Then, without thinking, I lifted it to my mouth and tasted it. *Salt.*

My world felt as if it were closing in on me. It didn't matter how many times my mind repeated the word *'no'*, the facts remained. I couldn't wish this away. I felt broken and completely lost. There was nothing I could do except to try to go through the motions of the rest of the night. I bathed, got dressed, went to bed, and pretended to be asleep. 

It took about an hour for him to crawl into bed next to me, then another to confirm he was sleeping. As soon as he started snoring, I rolled over in bed to face him, then lifted the covers and looked down at his body. *I need to check,* I thought. Holding my breath, I reached out and gently lifted the back of his shirt, disrupting his breathing pattern and causing him to shift slightly. I let go but scooted closer. Being caught inspecting his body that way would throw up alarms that I was onto him, but using my hands to do it under the ruse of cuddling wouldn't, I thought. 

I put my arm around him, resting it on his side. He didn't react, so I slid my hand underneath his shirt and slowly moved it around his back, searching for any anomaly. His skin was ice cold again and clammy. Almost *rubbery*. Other than that, I didn't feel anything else strange. So, I slowly moved down to his hip. When I got there, I froze. Something instantly felt wrong. Like, *very* wrong. 

His pelvic bone seemed to have somehow shifted from its natural upright position to tilting *downward.* My eyes widened, but I slowly resumed my inspection. As I began to run my fingers under the line of his boxers in disbelief, something hard and sharp protruding from his tailbone pricked the tip of my index finger. I ripped my hand away and instantly brought it to my mouth to stop the bleeding. When I did, my finger tasted like brine. I quickly turned back over to face my alarm clock. 

That night, as I lay in bed next to him, I didn't sleep. Instead, I resumed my endless loop of thoughts. And, in those thoughts, I finally stumbled upon a tiny speck of clarity drifting within a sea of confusion. I couldn't continue to live in this little fantasy land, pretending everything was perfect no matter how much I wanted to. What I needed was to be logical. I needed to look at this from a scientific perspective. Step one: form a theory. *I think my husband is a fucking fish person.* Step two: collect evidence in hopes of disproving said theory.

At exactly 4:44 AM, John stopped snoring. I shut my eyes tightly and waited as he got up and went to the bathroom. He spent about twenty minutes in there, doing God knows what, then immediately left the house. When I heard his engine start out front, I shot up and ran to the window. Then, I watched his headlights trail down the street until he got to the stop sign. He didn't take a left into town. Instead, he took a right, headed toward the ocean. 

I ran to the front door, grabbed my keys and a coat, and then shoved my feet into the first pair of shoes I could find. The harsh, cold night air hit me like a steamship, nearly knocking me over. I pulled the hood up over my head and scurried to my car, then tore down Hancock Street after him. A rush of adrenaline began surging through my body as I got closer and closer to the coast. Squinting through the darkness of the deserted street, I looked around in all directions, frantically trying to locate his vehicle. Then, I spotted it parked just outside the house of a local artist. 

The Shore Path ahead was closed for the winter, so I turned down Devilstone Way, made a U-turn to face the end of the road, and cut my lights off. Although the thought crossed my mind, my gut told me that he wasn't inside that house. I got out of my car, leaving it running, and started walking toward the bay. I ducked down under the large *'BEACH CLOSED'* sign and continued until I was a few feet away from the rocky coastline. And there he was. The dark silhouette of my husband... standing still at the water's edge, staring directly out into the abyss, and completely nude. 

My heart began thrashing against my chest like a fish caught in a net. On his lower back, a small, spiny dorsal fin glimmered in the moonlight. His legs were completely covered in silver scales from the knees down. Then, he began to turn his body in my direction, revealing the full extent of his pelvic deformity. I quickly lowered myself behind a large rock and watched on in horror through the fog as he turned back around and slowly began walking‚Äîstraight into the fucking ocean. 

I stood there, paralyzed with terror, as his head slowly sunk below the surface. Only a few breathless moments passed before he suddenly breached while biting down hard on a lobster. It thrashed and squirmed within the confines of his jaws until he'd separated the tail from the body. *Holy fuck.* My mind was unable to process what I was truly witnessing.

Instinct took over, and my hand shot up, covering my mouth to stifle my scream. I turned around and ran full speed back to my car. I didn't look behind me; I was too afraid. I just kept running and praying to God that he hadn't seen me. I threw the car in drive and booked it home, knowing he would be making his way back there any minute now that he'd had his... *breakfast.* I gagged, but I didn't have the time to be squeamish. The clock was ticking. I had to come up with a plan and fast. *Shit,* why couldn't I have married a nice boring accountant?!

When I got back inside the house, I slammed the door shut and looked down at John's field bag sitting on the floor next to the coat closet. I knew I only had seconds to spare, so I went straight for the side pocket where I knew he kept his flash drives. It was the only chance I had to find out exactly what I was dealing with here. I reached inside and dug around. *Yes!* My fingers met one just as I heard the brakes of his Jeep Wrangler squeal. I grabbed the drive and hurried to the bedroom, jumping into bed and throwing the covers over myself.

The front door latched closed, and I struggled to slow my breathing to an even, steady pace. I couldn't even begin to tell you the horrific thoughts that crossed my mind as I lay there, helpless. Just how far would he go to protect this secret from me? I listened to the noise of his wet feet *'plap-plaping'* around the house, using it to track his every movement like sonar. He never entered the bedroom, though. Just went through his normal morning routine, whatever that meant, then left for work. 

I didn't know if he'd seen me. *Hell,* a part of me didn't even care. Things couldn't continue this way. After what I'd just seen, it was impossible. Yet, somehow, John had been able to quickly conjure up an excuse for every outlandish behavior he'd displayed thus far. He'd probably tell me I must've been dreaming or something. Confronting him using only words wasn't an option. I needed irrefutable evidence, even more than I'd already collected. 

I called my boss, telling him I was sick and that I wouldn't be able to make it into work. He'd just have to wait one more day for that report. I had bigger fish to fry. I grabbed the laptop from my field bag and sat down at the island, booting it up and inserting the flash drive with shaking hands. I hesitated for a moment before opening the file. Did I really want to know the truth? Was I truly ready to open up this can of worms? I knew that from this point on, there was no going back. I inhaled slowly and deeply, then clicked. 

The top of the page read:
*MDI Biological Laboratory: Pioneering New Approaches in Regenerative Medicine.*   

*Fuck.* Jessica was right. Should I call her? No, I can't. She made it clear she didn't want to be involved. I was on my own with this. With bated breath, I scrolled on. 

What followed was a wall of text filled with scientific jargon. I'll spare you the complicated details and summarize the best I can in layman's terms. Researchers were able to create synthetic bioluminescence systems by modifying a specific enzyme called *'luciferase,'* using a process known as directed evolution. This allowed for use in various applications, including the deep organs and tissues of other living animals. Yes, you did read that correctly. 

There are more than forty known bioluminescent systems in the natural world, but only eleven of them have been able to be recreated and utilized by scientists with this specific technology. A new research project was formed in hopes of discovering how to manipulate and synthesize other bioluminescent systems, including those containing *'aequorin,'* the photoprotein responsible for creating *blue* light. 

Oh... my... fucking... God. I slammed the laptop shut. It all made sense; the clammy skin, the salt everywhere, the *'cold plunges,'* the *LOBSTER?!?!* Christ‚Äîall of it! *Son of a bitch.* I wondered what else I'd missed and started tearing the house apart, looking for more evidence. I'm well aware that I'd already collected more than enough in support of my theory. What I was looking for, secretly wishing for, was *anything* that might prove me wrong. 

Instead, I found more dried-up fish scales tucked away in different drawers all over the house. I found salt lining the corners of the floors and crusting to the edges of the baseboards. In the bathroom trashcan were several shrimp heads hidden underneath wads of slimy toilet paper. I remembered the hose and went out to the backyard to see what he'd been doing. 

A giant hole had been dug in the middle of our yard and filled with water, creating an enormous mud pit that spanned almost the entire length of the fence line. A dozen or so empty bags of aquarium salt lay discarded on the grass beside it. 

I dropped down to the ground, my knees hitting the cold, soggy grass at the same time my heart did. I knew... I knew with every fiber of my being. But I still needed to hear him say it. It was the only way I'd have any chance of helping him. I was convinced that this *had* to have been some sort of horrible accident. He must've gotten involved with this sketchy research somehow, and maybe he'd cut himself while handling some of the genetic material. 

If I could just find a way to force him into telling me what had happened. If I could back him into a corner to where he could no longer deny it, then maybe together, we could try to reverse whatever was going on with his body. Or, at the very least, stop it from getting any worse. I hoped. 

I walked inside the house, sat down at the laptop, and went back to the very first thing I'd researched when all of this crazy shit started. Hatchetfish. And then, with about four hours until he arrived back home from work, I formed a hypothesis... and devised a plan.

Tuna. One of the top predators in the ocean. An unsuspecting killer lurking in the depths of the Atlantic. The local seafood market had it on sale that week. Freshly cut tuna steaks for $10.99 per pound. I drove into town and purchased two large steaks, along with the ingredients needed to make a lemon-caper sauce. Then, I sped back home, with my thoughts racing. 

I needed once and for all to expose him for the fish-man I knew he was. To provoke a response so extreme, so undeniable it would be impossible for him to hide or explain away. I didn‚Äôt care anymore about how he might react. I was prepared to do whatever I had to do to save my husband. I looked down at my watch. *3:41 PM.* A little more than an hour left. The food would take almost no time at all to prepare, so I used the remaining moments I had alone to go through our wedding album. 

I sat down on the couch with tears forming behind my eyes as I reflected on how happy that day was for us. Best day of our lives. The last five years with him had truly been so perfect. I couldn't understand why or even how it had all gone so wrong so quickly. All I knew was that I had to try to fix this. I had to get John back. 

I sunk down into the cushions and began hugging the throw pillow beside me. Suddenly, my phone vibrated, jolting me back into an upright position. 

""Headed home.""

*Go-time.* I shut the photo album, wiped my eyes, and then made my way to the kitchen. I started on the sauce first, throwing it together in about ten minutes and remembering to set aside a few lemon wedges to use as garnish. Then, I started searing the tuna: one and a half minutes on each side. I set two plates out on the island and took in a deep breath as I heard him pull into the driveway. 

My entire body was shaking, but I knew I had to try to stay calm. I couldn't risk spooking him before he was in position. 

""*Hey...*"" he said with a confused smile as he entered the kitchen. 

Standing strategically in front of the pan on the stove, I replied, 

""Hey, John. I've got a surprise for dinner tonight."" 

He sat down and sniffed at the air intensely. Then, he stopped, and the smile slowly faded from his face. His Adam's apple bounced upward as he swallowed hard, and his pupils began to dilate. 

""What is it?"" He asked nervously. 

I grabbed the pan from the stove and quickly plopped one of the steaks down onto the plate in front of him. 

""Tuna,"" I said. 

He looked down at it, and his eyes widened. As I began to pour the sauce over his steak, his nostrils flared, and he began breathing heavily. I squeezed a bit of juice from the lemon wedge around his plate. But I was so focused on watching him for a reaction that I accidentally squirted a droplet into his eye. 

He didn't flinch. Instead, two vertical-facing inner eyelids quickly slid from each corner, meeting in the middle with a squish. My mouth fell open, and I gasped. I dropped the wedge and ripped my hand away, but before I could even fully react to that horror, another began to unfold in front of me. On his stomach, underneath his button-up Hawaiian shirt, a set of six tiny blue lights began to glow. 

I jumped backward, tripping on the barstool next to me and hitting the ground hard. I quickly scrambled back up to my feet, then pointed my finger at John and screamed,

*""I FUCKING KNEW IT!!""*

His expression remained neutral as he looked down at his glowing belly, then back up at me. I'd finally caught him‚Äîno way he was going to be able to wriggle his way off *this* hook. There was nothing he could say, nothing he could do. Now, he'd have to admit to me what was truly going on. 

""Sonia. I'm dying.""

Those three words snatched the wind right out of my sails. It couldn't be real. My chest tightened, and my arm dropped back down to my side. The room filled with a stifling thickness as he looked up at me with dread. 

""*‚Ä¶ What?*"" 

He hung his head low as he slowly pushed the plate away from himself and whispered, 

""I thought I had more time. But, nothing I've tried has worked.""

""John, I don't understand. Tell me what happened to you!"" I demanded. 

He took in a deep breath, tapped his finger on the island a few times, and then began to speak. 

""Back when this all started, I honestly never thought it would go *this* far. At first, it was just a joke. Howard dared me to do it. Stupid, I know.""

He forced out a nervous laugh. Then, his leg began bouncing up and down as I stared on in silence. His head rose, his lip beginning to quiver. He looked me straight in the eyes and continued,

""During the first few weeks, I quickly realized that some of the changes were... well, more than I'd bargained for, to say the least. Sonia, I swear‚ÄîI tried to stop it, I tried to fix it. But... I don't know, I just... couldn't keep myself from going back. I started to like it."" 

""*John...* are... are you telling me you did this to yourself? *On purpose??*"" 

A single black tear escaped from his eye, trailing down the side of his cheek. 

""I didn't know what would happen,"" he said, his voice trembling with shame. 

""Well, it stops now!!"" I screamed. 

He slowly stood up from the barstool and placed his icy-cold hand on my shoulder. While looking deep into my eyes, he said, 

""It's too late.""

""John, no! *Please,* we have to tell someone! We have to at least try to get you help!!"" I begged.

He shook his head, his face sullen and streaked with more black stains. 

""I've taken too many doses. The effects are irreversible at this point. I've been trying to do everything I can to make living on land more comfortable for myself, so I could stay here with you. But, no matter what I do, it's becoming increasingly unbearable by the minute. I'm so sorry, Sonia. I wanted to tell you, I really did, but... I just couldn't. I'm so ashamed. I don't even know who I am or *what* I am anymore. Please, *please* forgive me.""

At that moment, the earth stopped spinning. All sound escaped from the room, and I was left only with the deafening thud of my heartbeat flooding my ears. I couldn't think. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't cry. I just stood there, frozen and hollow, as all the pieces of this puzzle finally snapped into place, and my entire world crumbled around me. My knees buckled, and I fell forward into his arms. 

Somehow, I allowed myself to forgive him for what he had done to himself, for committing this act of betrayal that cut so deeply. He hadn't done it to hurt me. His curiosity had gotten the better of him. That was just John. We embraced each other tightly for a few minutes before I was able to finally work up the courage to ask him, 

""What do we do now?"" 

The answer was simple but far from easy. In fact, it would be the hardest thing I'd ever have to do in my life for many reasons, and I didn't know if I had the heart to bear it. This choice would be one of the most devastating decisions a person could be asked to make. And yet, I agreed. 

I'm at the cove now, watching the dark waves violently crash against the rocks, letting the cold breeze sweep across my face as the sun sets on the horizon. I'm going to end this by saying: I love my husband... I truly do. I'll try to come back here to visit him whenever I can. But I *cannot* watch him slowly die in our house. I can't be selfish like that. It isn't about what I want. It's about what *he needs.* And I know deep down in my heart the right thing to do for him is to let him go.

My job was to preserve and protect coastal ecosystems. But today, instead of a report, I'll be handing in my resignation. To anyone reading this: I'm so sorry. The truth is, I have no idea what I've just released into that water and unleashed onto the world.",1,1754957264.0,creepcast,2,0.6,False
1mntm7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mntm7d/dumped_a_month_ago_and_confused/,dumped a month ago and confused,"So me and my ex were together for a year and a half. I loved her more than everything, and whilst the feeling of longing has since numbed, i miss her still.

When we broke up, she said it was for mental health reasons. She blamed a lot of stuff on me which I have since come to realise through therapy wasn‚Äôt all my fault, but I wasn‚Äôt the perfect partner. Chronically stoned and what not. I‚Äôve been going to therapy, i‚Äôm in NA and i‚Äôm trying to work on myself, for myself.

Two weeks ago we met up for coffee (or that was the intention, she changed the plan to talking in my room last minute). When we initially broke up, she said a lot she wanted to be friends. I said I needed to discuss certain things as in the two months leading up to our breakup she refused to talk or acknowledge the ways she was hurting me (including by pulling away slowly and refusing a convo). This turned into a shit fest of her yelling at me for 3 hours straight, calling me crazy, insane and saying I made it all up. Since then, this moment had led me to detach and stop obsessing as much. I blocked her on almost everything, and went on a few dates (with the intention of  socialising and hooking up, not dating). She was still checking my tiktok account (which has no uploads) until the other day when she blocked me. I hadn‚Äôt checked hers on reached out but I can tell due to our chat history.

I‚Äôm confused, why she blocked me all of a sudden and also just how she could be so brutal when she use to be so loving. I want so badly to be the person I couldn‚Äôt become when we were together. She says she might not ever forgive me for my mistakes, but my friends and third parties who were witness to said mistakes see her as in the wrong. Nevertheless, i‚Äôll always want her back. I never believed in soul mates until I met her.

All this is to say that I don‚Äôt know what to do, what to think, what to feel. But i love her, i miss her. And i know that the only way for her to ever love me again is for me to get over it and no longer hinge my life on her? right‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm not sure.",1,1754957158.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

We were all wounded, but he finished us off.


and we complained to him about why he did that, we lost one of the cashouts due to that stupidity, out of nowhere, it started burning itself, burning my mines, throw orange barrels at me, he became a very big nuisance for both of them.

Fashion tried to kill the light with the gas.
He started going AFK from the middle of the second game, which is precisely the beginning of the video.

Im going solo and my first two were also solo and I had an absolutely fantastic time at both Electric Forest in 2024 and Veld 2025.  You, me, everyone is going to be so happy to be dancing in the forest and vibing out together to close out our summers. 

Solo travelers: Dont be afraid, you'll do great! 

Im bringing lots of bacon/eggs/coffee and trinkets; like light-up balls, and mini ducks, and kandi (bracelets). Since those are always a big hit and a great icebreaker.

1mntg09,https://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1mntg09/how_does_normal_life_outside_as_a_5555556_guy/,How does normal life outside as a 5‚Äô5.5‚Äù(5‚Äô5‚Äù-5‚Äô6‚Äù) guy look like?,"So is normal life possible for someone 5‚Äô5.5‚Äù? 
Have people perceive me as a regular adult guy?

- go to the grocery store in normal clothes and be seen as an adult guy shopping for grocery. If I am in a suit or a shirt/loose tie then still normal because I went after work. 
- go to the gym and yes I am short but I am a guy, so not totally funny when I am on the machines etc. 
- wear a suit and pretty much be anywhere and not seen as a child wearing a suit. Like basically not look funny in a suit. 
- go to the bar and get a drink etc. idk why people do this if not meeting someone there. If I go alone can it be ok? Go to the liquor store and be ok being carded. Go get some cigarettes at the gas station and have it be fine. 
- go to any sort of social event being appropriately dressed and be fine? Suits on weddings/professional events. Casual clothes in outings, restaurants, house parties, etc. 
- go to a cafe and get something and sit there and work. 
- have a date with me anywhere and not look weird. Like funny. Or be insecure in front of a good looking couple where they are ‚Äúideal‚Äù. Maybe walk in the mall together, outside, get coffee, etc. 

I think I could be? I know a medical professional I have seen a couple times and he was about 5‚Äô6‚Äù I would say. 

Saw a few people here and there in the gym. 

I actually know some people like this and they are good looking (atleast a 7 disregarding height), they seem to look fine out and about. They have short parents. A 5‚Äô4‚Äù-5‚Äô5‚Äù girl told me she was into one of them, and she has been with ideal men (let‚Äôs say) all the time.

It always works when I need it to and was guided to explore beyond it. Emotional intent means a lot in use and practice. If it doesn‚Äôt matter, who cares. Sometimes a little amount is what matters. Sometimes it‚Äôs what can fog the mind. Worry alongside practice manifests how the cycle should complete. I am certain that it‚Äôs not the one it‚Äôs been 4 times in a row and I feel it is every time until I choose it and it‚Äôs not. Often, especially once I took a second to think about it. I just need a breathe. ‚Äúnow rest‚Äù. Most humans have emotions. It is up to you to understand and regulate them. Pretty hard sometimes for some people. I think it‚Äôs why I‚Äôm often attracted to high energy no matter their appearance. 
Money fixes pain is not completely wrong when you are not self sufficient. A lot of people go to stores for most things. It‚Äôs also a belief that will affect you to your core if you let it. You most likely didn‚Äôt deserve it and regardless you should take it as a lesson, if not from anyone else, from the subconscious. Many others and I experienced what happens when other people decide to use their free will. I like to use mine to be thankful someone else used there‚Äôs to work at a place where they decide to make good coffee. 
My experiences in alert situations made me want to push towards the middle. There is a definitive answer. 
Does not mean jack to what hasn‚Äôt happened yet. Technically. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm picking into a bag and having the answer. 
To be completely honest it‚Äôs the same state I was in after I woke up constipated and I wasn‚Äôt, maybe, was not why I felt like that tho. I technically had no knowing of someone else and was reluctant to turn around. As I felt them, more context came to be. All true and disturbing because without the context I had been given before turning around. It would have happened again. Hearing ‚ÄúYou choose your words well‚Äù and knowing why I chose them added a little more to the shock. It was more of a jumping off point as it was my first memory and I did not know what to do so after getting context from the guy and then being told to run away I did so and blacked out. I remember asking myself growing up, ‚Äúcan I go to sleep?‚Äù I would black out for large periods of time growing up with most memories in-between spent questioning coming into existence. I had friends that liked me from previous interactions and that was our starting point. Stopped around middle school because my mom and step dad fought a lot and threatened a lot so felt like I had to be ready. My mom taught me how to meditate by grounding me and telling me to think about it. It worked and most of the time it went from the problem to empty waiting to whatever happened next. Often the problem needed context that would not be given because I was not apart of the issue. My mom would start the conversation yelling and question me as if I was regardless of if it was true. She often ended up apologizing in her own way and unground me. I got the context because I couldn‚Äôt avoid it. With how chaotic everything was at home, everything outside it felt like a blessing. I love walking. It felt like a forecast somedays. I don‚Äôt know how the area is nowadays but side streets were often necessary or helpful while also being the most dangerous parts. ‚ÄúNot that one‚Äù as I decide to go another way felt like the emotional intent to protect myself while it doesn‚Äôt extend to will to live, it does exist. Often the guidance is elder male or intuitive with many experiences being unique with commonality in Non-Verbal Communication, often thought. Sometimes it sounded demonic but not in a ‚ÄúI want to hurt you way‚Äù but a ‚Äúthis ain‚Äôt your karmic cycle, go a different way or see what it is‚Äù. I would go another way and ask about it because the further I got the more it disappeared. The context I got was that, demons like to play with souls that let them. Usually addiction and circumstance.  
While doing free focus exercises, or before I knew that term, exploring the unknown, I‚Äôve had experiences where I needed to present the same information differently because an energy form did not understand. 
I love playing video games that help with my precognitive decision making and I recommend it to those that are in this subreddit or enjoy ESP.
Sometimes I‚Äôm a dummy.
Sometimes my channel is too open.
Sometimes it‚Äôs both.
I never thought I‚Äôd make it this far and understanding what I call the Unknown is all I ever asked of myself. When I really asked myself for if I stayed was music. I am thankful to incorporate what I feel blessed with throughout my life. It was not worth how it became present. I‚Äôm pretty sure it might have been a different development process if I had a normal upbringing but I got sad at how little it mattered to my intuition outside of protection. There‚Äôs not many situations you can ‚Äúpass‚Äù on a decision with little to no consequence within its context. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the point of it tho. Hold faith and understand why ‚Äúit‚Äôs not working‚Äù. Most times, it‚Äôs rest. There is a definitive answer. Breathe and try again. Listen to the universes message. Sometimes it‚Äôs time to rest. Never has to be long but if that‚Äôs your intent going into it, it should last forever.
Be patient and never stop progressing forward. You are trusted because you show a high capacity to comprehend. It‚Äôs a learning process to work with intuition. It‚Äôs a tool, not a hammer lol

I have posted pictures of foreign stores. The first one is in Tokyo, and the second two are in Bangkok. 

They are super clean and very comfortable, and if I did not take good photos to demonstrate the amount of seats they have, I‚Äôm sorry, but they are packed full of sofas and chairs and conversation sets.

I posted pictures earlier of bare stores in New York and I was told that this has something to do with the homeless walking in and making themselves at home. So all furniture gone. Just walls and a coffee bar. However, I found the same experience in Orlando, in San Diego, and in Los Angeles.  Empty and lifeless stores. I really feel bad for the baristas especially, having to work in such a depressing environment. The place is like a desert of its former self.

In comparison, the stores in Asia are absolutely vibrant and beautiful, even after Covid. No one is forced to write with sharpies or pretend to converse. Each store is self managed and has its own flavor. No micromanagement. I have spoken to the managers, because I was curious.

I think what needs to happen is all US upper management fired. Trash out, fresh perspective in. They have completely lost touch with reality. If they are not fired, they should be brought to Asia so that they can be taught a thing or two by their more creative counterparts. Thankfully, the rest of the world is still pushing the image of the real Starbucks. I don‚Äôt know how hometurf completely lost its way, but this is what happens when you have poor management and a lack of foresight. They do not deserve their salaries‚Äî even if they inherently believe they do.

I am sorry you have such bad management. I hope the US stores find the way back to their old selves so the baristas don‚Äôt have to work in such horrid locations. ",16,1754955983.0,starbucks,7,0.83,False

We‚Äôre planning on moving out next summer.¬†



We‚Äôve visited in the late spring, summer, late fall, and winter. I planned the January visit specifically to see the rainy time, but apparently caught the one stray week of dry, sunny weather in the season. Oh well.



My wife works remotely and I‚Äôm in healthcare. I expect to find a job at either OHSU, the VA downtown, or at the Kaiser Interstate offices.¬†

We‚Äôve tried to spend time in a number of the neighborhoods on the east side and I think I like Sellwood and the Vernon/Concordia areas the best.



We‚Äôd like to buy a home at some point in the future, if we get through our first few winters and still like it as much as I think we will. But for now we‚Äôre looking at renting. Looking at prices on Zillow we could afford a to buy in Sellwood or Alberta down the line.



What we‚Äôd be walkable to in an ideal neighborhood:

* a park for our dog
* a grocery store
* a gym with for weightlifting and some kind of gym that has group classes
* several coffee shops a local library branch
* some kind of hiking or biking trails/paths

Close to good restaurants or nice cocktails bars would be a plus.



About us: We‚Äôre in our early 30s and don‚Äôt have kids or plan to. A little crunchy. We love hiking, camping, biking, nearly any outdoors hobby really, cooking, and reading.



QUESTIONS:

* Do you think Sellwood or Alberta would be good neighborhoods for what we‚Äôre looking for?
* Our dog is very sensitive to city noises: loud cars/trucks, trains, etc.¬†
   * Are the trains very loud in Sellwood? Is the noise from the airport loud by Alberta?

Go to a country because you‚Äôre drawn to the culture, the lifestyle, and the opportunities there, not just because you think the women are easier. If your main reason for going somewhere is ‚ÄúI heard it‚Äôs easy to get laid,‚Äù you are setting yourself up for disappointment.

No woman is truly ‚Äúeasy‚Äù in the way guys imagine. If you do meet someone who throws themselves at every foreigner, most of the time they are unstable or looking to use you. That is not a win, it is a headache.

Dating can be part of why you travel. I am not saying ignore women. But it should not be the only reason. If you only focus on women, you will attract the worst kind and miss everything else the country has to offer.

Build a real reason to be there. Have a niche. Love surfing? Go live in one of the best surf spots in the world. Love coffee? Go to Colombia or Brazil and spend time in the coffee regions. Learn the craft, meet the farmers, and understand the culture. Into history, art, music, or martial arts? Go to the places where those things thrive.

When you have a purpose, you naturally become more attractive, not just to women but to everyone you meet. People respect passion and curiosity.

No woman will complete you. You have to complete yourself first. Travel should be about growing into someone interesting, confident, and capable. If you focus on that, the dating side will take care of itself wherever you are in the world.",10,1754955497.0,thepassportbros,5,0.81,False

I've only had this job for a month, and it really is just like any other (barista) job: I show up, I make coffee, and I go home. But (as I only found out would be the case *after* I accepted the position), I'm ""self-employed"" (according to my boss) and have to invoice and register for self-assessment. This was all new to me at the time and the implications were not clear, however I've come to understand that this is essentially a way for my employer to dodge his NI contributions, as well as avoid having to pay me any holiday or sick pay.

I was already thinking of how to broach this topic with my boss, but today I finally got round to applying for self-assessment, and in the process was directed to HMRC's CEST tool ([here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-employment-status-for-tax)). I filled in the questionnaire and, lo and behold, it tells me that for tax purposes I am ""employed"", and my understanding is that this also likely means I am ""employed"" from a worker's rights perspective.

I raised this with my boss today via text, and even sent him the results of the questionnaire. He says that because I invoice the company I am self-employed, and I am ""responsible for [my] obligations"". He also claims that I haven't filled the form in correctly, which is possible (some of the questions were about things that I haven't discussed with him, so I answered to the best of my understanding, but these are really minor aspects of the whole situation in my eyes).

I'm not sure how to continue.

   The next year im am going to graduate from school, and this makes me so stressed, cause i am  going to uni, i am going to need communication skills or  at least  stoppped being so sociophobic. The last 3 years i was on individual tuition cause of my heart problems. Also as everyone in 2020-21, i studied online. All of this made me so isolated from society. I was never really friendly or convivial, but i had a few friends in school. I dont think that someone could call me unsocial, i was able to find common ground witn others. But now i dont think that i can do this. I dont have friends or some kind of social circle probably for about a year or more.  I stopped hanging out with friends I had a long time ago.  Most of the times, i talk only with my mom, sometimes with my sister. Or to my teacher during the school year.  Of course i have social interaction like with cashiers, baristas etc. But a few months ago it was big deal for me to just order coffee or even go fir a short walk. I felt so anxious. At some point i still trying to deal with this, to fight it. I didn‚Äôt have problems like this four or even three years ago. 
  Two years ago i had depression, this was a long and hard period. Almost year i was drowning in feelings of hopelessness,  everything felt so distant from me. Sometimes there was a feeling of derealization. But then i have big changes in my life and my life seemed to be normal. Back than i remember that i thought that it was just some kind of regular mental problems, maybe all teens had this. I was wrong. Ten months ago depression came back. Im glad that this time i didnt ignore my feelings and turned to psychologist. This helps me to understand that my isolation played a big role in the onset of depression. I saw how this affects on me, my relationships with others, my mental and physical health. But i still struggle so much with my self isolation. I became used to be alone, and i rarely want some company. Because i just get unaccustomed to company. It feels like i need to learn how to talk to people again. It is a big problem. You know isolation its like addiction, each time it gets worse. And you dont even understand the problem until its change your entire life.
   At the moment i dont feel that anxious or stressed when i talk with someone. But i still didnt build any friendships or at least some kind of relationships with people my age. Usually, i am trying to make friends online on platforms for finding people with common interests ( cause, even if i have progress at socializing, it stiil hard for me to talk to strangers offline).Yet something still doesn‚Äôt work. I get acquainted with someone, everything goes well and i find our conversation fascinating. But in a couple of days i lost interest, or better to say: I forget to write or I just don't feel like writing to this person or does communication feel like an obligation. But to put it more simply, I no longer feel like communicating. Maybe i just need to try another way to find friends or interlocutors. I dont know what to do. I wouldn‚Äôt be so desperate about this, If it wasn‚Äôt affecting on my life so much.",2,1754955167.0,socialanxiety,1,1.0,False

I watch a lot of Charlotte and love everything, and thought I‚Äôd share the story of my ex and the drama. Strap in it‚Äôs long and this is the cut version! 

Now bare in mind this was several years ago I am currently 36, and for a long time it hit my self esteem because I kept questioning what I had done wrong and how stupid I was for not seeing it, but I am finally past it all and aware of red glaring flags!!

So honestly off the top of head I can‚Äôt remember how old I was but I think I was probably 28 (f) btw and I was on a dating app and met this guy who popped up as local to me. He 28 (m) at the time, same age, lets call him Jamie, worked at the services down the road from where I live- right next to the park and ride service I used to get to work. 
So we go on our first date and looking back the red flags were everywhere, we had our first date at a caravan park his nan had a caravan in, and we had a romantic fire pit dinner and stayed in a tent. Ok I know staying with someone of the first date is a bit fast but we‚Äôd been talking for a couple months before we met, so I felt ok about it. I also shared my location with a friend who was near by and we had a code word if I needed to get out. I didn‚Äôt though we had a great night together and shortly after become official. 

The red flag were: 
1. That we literally NEVER went to his place. We always meet out we stayed over at mine and would sometimes stay at B&B‚Äôs if we wanted more privacy (I at the time was between flats and back at my mums place)
2. He worked at the services and I would go by most mornings or evenings depending ofnour shift schedule to see him and he would consider this ‚Äòtime together‚Äô - because ‚Äòwe led busy lives and were both career driven‚Äô
3. When I went by he would by me coffees for my journey into the city center (I parked in the park and ride and then travel into the city this would be 20mins of so cos of traffic) but he‚Äôd only ever come up to the Starbucks with me and buy me a coffee when his friend - lets call her Claudia - wasn‚Äôt there so then I bought my own (just to clarify I don‚Äôt expect it I‚Äôm happy to pay for my own coffee it was more the behaviour- he didn‚Äôt pay everytime we went over together just a good amount) 
4. He spent every Saturday playing football with his team and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to come along there was always an excuse - context I worked mostly Saturdays so it was rare I got one off and when I did I thought it would be nice to show interest and be involved in something he loved. 
5. He never introduced me to any friends, family etc. 
6. He wouldn‚Äôt make us fb official as he ‚Äòliked his privacy‚Äô

These are just a few but some of the more obvious ones in hindsight. 

We had been dating for 9 months (we met in end of September- online talking since July) and when my birthday came round in the following June we‚Äôd been together about 9 months give or take a week. 
He spoilt me - bought me a Michael kors handbag, took me to dinner came round spend the evening with me and bought prosecco and generally just was super loving and over like three days so it was an extended celebration it was really lovely. 

A few weeks later I decided to post up a pic of some of gifts I got for my birthday including the handbag - to mention here I‚Äôm super lazy with social media stuff and I was also very busy in season (I work in weddings and events) so the summer months I‚Äôm always a bit rammed. So I hadn‚Äôt done it at the time and thought I‚Äôd put up a bit of an appreciation post. 
So I took the picture posted up a lovely comment tagging a few people like my mum and siblings and obviously mentioned my amazing boyfriend- Jamie and how wonderful he‚Äôd been. 
Later that day I saw a private message on my FB from someone so I‚Äôm sitting on the bus back to my car and I open it up and low and behold it‚Äôs from his female best friend. Let‚Äôs call her Sarah. Sarah had sent a short message saying- ‚ÄòYou should be careful who your calling your boyfriend when they are someone else‚Äôs‚Äô 

Well to say my heart dropped is an understatement. My heart was pounding like crazy and I was completely in shock I got back to my car and sat there for like a full 10 minutes before I could actually drive. I drove to his work but he wasn‚Äôt there he‚Äôd already left and so I drove home went down the pub where my best friend worked and made her take a smoking break so I could tell her about this message. 
She was also shocked and then told me to message back - ‚Äòok well whose boyfriend is he then?‚Äô Which I did and then sat there for a terrifying 10 minutes before she replied. 

‚ÄòMine‚Äô 
Well boy was I shook. I knew he had a female best friend he told me from the start but I was cool with that I had loads of male friends I was really close to so I didn‚Äôt see the problem. 
The proceeding 5 hours turned into my pointing out he was also dating me, and us messaging back and forth with proof of each others relationship with him. 
As it turned out he was a master at manipulating us, dates he told me he was working overtime or doing a family thing he was with her and vice versa. We could account for nearly every day over Christmas bar two. At which point Sarah said she‚Äôd had her suspicions he was cheating - but she‚Äôd thought it was with Claudia. (Yes Starbucks girl!) 

She said she only really knew me as new friend he‚Äôd met thought another friend from work. There‚Äôs a whole other element to this with him hooking Sarah and I up-  professionally speaking - because she was a photographer and I did weddings and events so I had her down on a suppliers list after he showed me some of her work. Looking back - risky move! 

Anyway the long and short of it was he‚Äôs been with her 18months- although they had been friends way way longer since birth and had dated previously but cos he‚Äôd cheated they broke up and had got back together 9months before we started dating. 
So basically he was a massive pig. 

We decided also to message Claudia and see if we could get the skinny on if he was seeing her too, I too had a feeling of unease about her the one time I accidentally bumped into her and him together at a shopping center near his house when I‚Äôd been out buying a gift for his mums birthday- which btw he passed on to her apparently again I never met her. 
We messaged Claudia and turns out yes she did think they were dating.- so here we go girlfriend number 3 maybe we can work out the missing dates and holes in his story BUT Thing is she was completely deluded/ had been fed into his lies for too long and did not believe either of us was also dating him. She wouldn‚Äôt have it told us we were delusional and were just obsessed with wanting to date him that we were in ‚Äòfake relationships with him in our heads‚Äô. 

Well needless to say we both broke up with him. I sent him a screen shot of Sarah‚Äôs orginal message to me and my initial replies, told him we were done and he could go fuck himself and however many other girlfriends he had and to lose my number. I promptly blocked him and deleted. He did try to get in contact on another number and play it off but I had all the proof of his lies. 

As far as I am aware Sarah broke up with him but said he didn‚Äôt want to end the friendship as they had been friends since birth (their mums were best friends) and she was in contact and I fear she might have gone back to him at some point. Claudia definitely stuck around not sure how long that lasted but I suspect along as his lies still made sense. I did see her once she was with someone else though! 

Last I heard he was still single or not settled down at least. I am however with the love of my life, he‚Äôs the best man ever treats me amazingly and the best part absolutely no red flags- and now I know how to spot them!!

I feel like I‚Äôm really deep in burnout right now, I owe a lot of placement hours so I‚Äôm staying in to make them up, my dissertation is due in a week and I‚Äôve done nothing because every time I go to do it, it feels too overwhelming, I‚Äôm estranged from a lot of my family, I‚Äôm currently unemployed due to being on placement and I have to move out of my current accommodation in two weeks and I have nowhere to go and no money.

My anxiety gets worse at night, especially with the fact that I‚Äôm alone with my thoughts and I have no one to reach out to. Every time I go to close my eyes, I just have several voices in my head talking about how much I have to do tomorrow, how I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing with my dissertation, how I‚Äôm gonna fail and ruin my life, and the main thing that keeps me up is that whenever I tell myself that I‚Äôm gonna be okay and that I will get my dissertation handed in and everything will work out.

I'll be visiting Oklahoma City the first weekend of October.

I'm not sure what else I'll do exactly, but Myriad Botanical Gardens is on my list plus a brewery, most likely Prairie Artisan Ales since I know I like their beer, but it could be someplace else. As far as running goes, after some preliminary research, I was thinking Scissortail Park or Skydance Bridge or maybe both. 

My questions are, do I need a car for this, or can I just uber/lyft from the airport to the hotel (not that I have one yet, but my plan is to stay downtown)? As long as it's safe - I'm a solo woman - and things are a reasonable distance, I prefer walking when I'm on trips. Also, are the places I plan to run good choices, or does anybody have other suggestions? Other than running, anything in general I must do or places I must go?

1mnsmuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1mnsmuz/cafe_restaurant_work_environment_questions/,Cafe & Restaurant work environment questions?,"Hi! For context, i am pretty new in the industry, i had only done coffee work at home for my brother and i, but i already knew how to maneuver the espresso machine, texturized milk and all that. The thing is, i arrived to this cafe/restaurant by chance, and they offered me a part time, the place was right about to open, so everything was very chaotic and none of the team knew each other, i was expecting to have a station already good to go, but this is where problems start.

The machine we have is quite old and has a lot of problems, i've managed to work around all of them. I had other 2 baristas hired with me, one full time and another part time, both of them were sent for training, i wasn't. The big problem is, the ambient and expectations of the place are quite high, always high stress, a lot to do, and the owners are extremely picky about how things work, they make me weight the coffee remains per kilograms and report all that as missed product, same with the rest of recipes, it's even worse for the kitchen staff. The system they set us up for payment is also a nightmare, and our waitresses are always having difficulties. Our administrator never really gives clear directions or is actual ""helpful"", and only keeps talking about ""communication"" and ""teamwork"" but he does nothing to help resolve the issues. Our chef de cuisine was furious with our barista station lead, he just told us to ""work around it between us"", which was quite horrid to do, in fact, this barista station lead just quit today. We had a lot of problems with money too, same girl sent the cash count under my name, knowing that she had already made a mistake, I got worried about this because i don't want to have problems, or lose the job, and when i brought it up to my administrator, he called me ""childish"" over complaining of her ""writing down my name"".

We have been around 2 weeks on non stop work, most of the team stayed for an entire week on aprox 8-10 hours shift, getting everything to work, and we still havent got contracts done. Our tipping system is also weird, it doesnt count per hour worked, but per station, its divided between kitchen and front of the house. I also had a lot of problems with the recipes, since i was the only one that was not trained -i assumed because i knew how to do things already-, my recipes were different than the other girls, but so happens that the other girls dont care at all about making good coffee.

Mildly a rant, but i wanted to ask. Are all of these things normal? I have heard it's this stressfull, and about the long shifts too, mines on last weekend went up to 13 hour from 7 am to 9 pm, but at the same time i keep thinking ""This is supposed to be a specialty coffee. But these people dont even care about calibrating the espresso in the morning"" so i have my doubts, have you guys experiences been similar? What would you do in this situation?

EDIT: I forgot to mention minor things, like the other day after a huge rush (100+ people, probably more than 200 coffes) i got scolded for ""wasting too much milk"", when we don't even have all the correct size jars, so yea thats that HAHA

EDIT 2: Also. Our shifts. I should have a fixed part time 30 hours but they always ask me if i have ""available"" schedule to cover others, which is also, something.",2,1754954604.0,barista,2,1.0,False

A bit about me I'm a 42M and I did weigh 260 at 5'10"". Needless to say I've got a belly, and for the majority of my life I've ate whatever I've wanted to. Recently I have decided to make that effort to start losing weight. 3 weeks ago I started walking at different trails in wooded parks. While weighing myself today I am down to 241.9 So pretty close to 9lbs down so far. For context mon to fri at my job I walk over 10,000 steps a day easy. However I've only really started to feel a difference while walking at the park. I haven't made it to 5 days in a row walking yet, that is my next goal. I do make an effort to walk Sat and Sun as those are my 2 biggest sedentary days. I started off walking in the park doing about 2 to 2.5 miles each time. Today I did 3.3 and added on top of what I walked at work I walked 24,959 steps according to my phone. (Which for some reason my watch says only 20k steps)  

I am now looking into getting into the calorie deficit. I could really use some good meal plan recipes for the week. In the morning at work I drink a bolthouse smoothie about 300ish calories, and a cup of coffee(calories unkown), lunch at work I can eat those lean cuisine power bowls, like 400ish calories, then I need a dinner. I think 1500 calories a day is what I'm aiming for? I don't know if that's right. I love chicken! 

I'm pretty committed to this change in life, and what to lose weight. My goal is 220 for now. I absolutely love walking, it's been a huge stress reliever for me, and puts me in a good mood.  So now that I've rambled on, I hope this all makes sense. I believe I am looking for some guidance. What am I doing wrong, what should I focus on. It's all pretty overwhelming to me trying to look a lot of different information up.  Any help is very much appreciated. ",3,1754954532.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

Intersection of Cook and Caledonia, I was in front of Parsonage wearing flowy yellow stripped pants, a velvet shirt with colorful flower embroidery and pink/orange shoes.

You were on the church side with another women who had her white hair in a tight, high pony tail. You had light brown or dirty blonde hair and a big, bright smile. I was drawn to you and your smile, so naturally I looked away and pretended to be engrossed in staring at my feet....sigh.
I think maybe you work at one of the VIHA buildings, in the cluster of buildings on Pembroke.

As we crossed the street you turned toward me and kinda walked closer to me as opposed to keeping straight(both of you did). We made and held eye contact and it seemed like you wanted to say something but I had my headphones on, was in the middle of the street and didn't want to be presumptuous.

Maybe you're just smiley and eye contacty... If that's the case, thank you for the wonderful smile and mini connection. Maybe you just wanted to compliment my outfit, in which case, thank you.
Or maybe the sun was in your eyes and you didn't even notice me... It's quite possible, it was bright.

But, just in case it was an actual and legit missed connection, I would be down with connecting over a coffee and see if there is anything there.",20,1754954515.0,VictoriaBC,1,0.74,False

I'm both excited and full of dread to be seeking feedback for my contemporary romance novel. Thanks in advance :)

Dear agent,  
I‚Äôm excited to share SOMETHING'S BREWING, an 80,000-word, single-POV, standalone contemporary romance that follows two rival baristas‚Äîthe caffeine-fuelled cousin of *The Hating Game*. It will appeal to readers who loved the steamy rivalry between Grace and Eric in *The Launch Date* by Annabelle Slator and the delicious competition found in *Battle Royal* by Lucy Parker.

Paloma (Lo) Hale‚Äôs cafe is crumbling, and she blames one very annoying barista.

After years of working to build a loyal base of corporate caffeine addicts, Lo has found herself in a fiery war with handsome cafe owner Reuben Fowler. And it‚Äôs all because he opened a place nearby and stole her customers. Lo is willing to stoop lower than her nickname to win them back, from flyering his permanent line with discounts for her coffee to leaving a bad review of his cafe‚Äîthough, he did print that on his cups.

Reuben loves stirring Lo up, especially since it means she shows up at his cafe every day. He can't help but tease her espressos, even though deep down he knows they're much better than his. But he can see this war ending badly for ‚Äåboth of them. So when the National Barista Tournament announces it will be in town, Reuben shows up at Lo‚Äôs cafe and proposes a bet. If he wins the tournament, she stops her antics. If she wins, he'll tell everyone how divine her espressos are. Lo agrees on one condition: if neither wins, they never interact again.¬†

As they take part in the three-round competition, Lo isn't expecting her attraction to Reuben to heat up so intensely, and she's left wondering if there is more to their rivalry than cheap shots. So when a fellow competitor proves to be a worthy contender in round one, Lo must figure out whether she can live without Reuben or if something more is brewing.

**First 300:**  
The prick who owns the cafe down the street stole my favourite customer. How do I know he lured Victoria to his cafe? I saw her in one of her beloved grey pant suits, scurry past the large glass windows of my coffee shop mere minutes ago. That‚Äôs not all. She was also wearing an obnoxiously large, floppy-brimmed hat‚Äîthe woman works a desk job.

Yet on this drab winter morning, the first day of the working week for most but not for me, I am trying something new as I refill the grinder with a Peruvian dark roast. I am going to give her the benefit of the doubt. Even if she did sneak past in a hat with the circumference of an umbrella instead of coming in for her usual‚Äîa small double shot oat latte‚Äîat the same time she does every Monday to Friday. Maybe she has an errand to run, and she‚Äôs forcing herself to wear an impulse buy she made over the weekend. Or maybe it‚Äôs crazy hat day at work. Who knows what weird corporate team-bonding activities entail these days.

My new take on life comes from a segment I caught on a late-night TV show implying cynical women are more likely to die alone. Apparently, their cats will then eat them. I see nothing wrong with this scenario‚Äîand honestly, Ron Meowsly has the survival instincts of a balloon‚Äîbut there was a teeny tidbit about cynicism also causing wrinkles. So here I am, pretending my chest isn't tightening like a fainting goat and I'm not looking out the ceiling-high windows every two seconds for Victoria to rush through the blue door.

1mns7rj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1mns7rj/brain_dump_10_days_in_costa_rica/,Brain dump: 10 days in Costa Rica,"We just returned from 10 days in CR with our teenage kids and had a great time. I look back on younger me and the times we took our little kids on other vacations (i.e. Hawaii) and I'm glad we waited on this one. We subscribe to the mantra ‚Äúhave kids will travel‚Äù and have taken our kids lots of places. But as I sat on the plane home surrounded by screaming toddlers, I wondered why anyone would take small kids on an adventure-filled trip like this.¬†Better to wait imho. 

This was my second trip to CR - the first with my family. I went solo last year on a surf trip to Tamarindo and had an amazing time. So that trip set the stage for the family being comfortable with this year‚Äôs adventure though CR has been on our list for a long time. My kids are going to college and finishing high school and they‚Äôll remember this for the rest of their lives, unlike the Hawaii trips and mostly what I remember was being tired or drinking mai tais while they napped. 

For us coming from SF Bay Area, California, it‚Äôs about a 14 hour trip door to door to popular destinations in Guanacaste. I‚Äôve gotten a lot out of this travel sub and so wanted to pay it back. 

CR is a vibe. Despite the good infrastructure and friendly people, it‚Äôs just more rugged, mostly requires a little more effort, a little more planning, etc. But we all enjoyed it immensely. The days flew by.¬†

Our itinerary was:¬†

1. Land at LIR
2. Drive from Liberia to explore La Fortuna/Arenal area for adventure stuff
3. Drive to Tamarindo on a southern route via Nicoya. 
4. In Tamarindo: ditch the car, explore town, estuary, beach time, surfing
5. Depart LIR

We rented a car from Adobe, and I have zero complaints. The office is a short shuttle trip from LIR and they picked up the car in Tamarindo from our hotel when we no longer needed it. They even extended the rental for me when we decided we wanted it for a couple days past our initial reservation. Very flexible and no hidden fees. Good service all around.

**Random tips and takeaways**

* More car info: Car rental through Adobe was easy. As mentioned, they picked the car up for me in Tamarindo at our hotel, for no fee.
   * Driving in CR is easy but everything takes longer than you think it should.¬†
   * I see a lot of people in this thread worried about winding roads and such. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal for us. The speed limits are confusing and you can never tell how fast you‚Äôre supposed to be going (is it 40 kph, is it 60? now it's 20? wtf!). But then locals are passing you. I didn‚Äôt care, just didn‚Äôt want a ticket!¬†
   * Every town has unmarked speed bumps that are a literal pain in the butt. Watch out for them.¬†
   * Parking in Fortuna is mostly managed via app payments or at a kiosk. I saw parking cops writing tickets, beware.
* We scored on the weather, with only one stormy afternoon in Tamarindo (which was exciting to us and was either a bad storm or no big deal, depending on who you asked). Other rain showers appeared at night which was lovely.¬†
* I booked all excursions a couple days ahead of time. Book directly from the outfitters rather than a third party site like TripAdvisor or Viator. I needed a refund for one of our people who couldn‚Äôt zip line, and was able to get it thanks to the fact that I booked direct.¬†
* Prices: it‚Äôs almost as expensive as living in California. Stuff just costs a lot there. Shop for food in markets. Stock up on food, water, snacks, drinks, etc. when you can. 
   * Produce: Don‚Äôt expect many good greens. The fruit is delicious, though.¬†
* Water. It‚Äôs clean and none of us had any issues with ice or water in restaurants (though we defaulted to bottled water). My wife was worried about the water but I found that bottle fillers/filtration systems in and around hotels were fine and cold.¬†
   * Bring a refillable bottle. Plastic waste is a big problem in CR like everywhere else.
* We ended up keeping the SUV for an extra day and used it to spend an afternoon exploring the Flamingo marina and beach. Saw some giant yachts and the beach nearby is excellent. Then we got whacked by the insane thunderstorm and had to flee back to Tamarindo.
* Other than a couple beggars in Fortuna and drug offers in Tamarindo, I felt safer than in many places in America. People generally are warm, helpful, and friendly.¬†My kids were more freaked out by downtown Seattle a couple months ago. 
* Take small bills ($1/$5) for tips. Tip the locals/guides/drivers/hotel staff generously.¬†
* Take bug spray. I didn‚Äôt really need it around Arenal but at the beach I was eaten alive and came home with lots of itchy bites on arms and legs.
* Drink local beer! Skip the Imperial and look for Numu, Papagayo, Brothers of Ale, etc. 
* Don‚Äôt stress too much on planning. Just go and see where the day takes you, do what looks interesting as you see things and get tips from others. ¬†
* Go solo. I see a lot of questions in this sub and did it myself last year. I met others this year who are doing it including a woman I surfed with a few days ago. You won't regret it, you'll meet great people, etc. 

**Recommendations**

Fortuna/Arenal area

* Lost Iguana hotel - off the beaten path about 25 minutes from La Fortuna. Gorgeous views of Arenal from every room. It's tucked away on the road to Mistico Hanging Bridges.
   * From the hotel/on the road to Mistico: do the (free) Puma Trail. It‚Äôs empty and arguably a better (though shorter) hike than Mistico, even has a couple bridges. Trails are muddy. I‚Äôm surprised we saw few critters on either trail, but we talked to others who saw monkeys, etc. We were able to take our time on the Puma Trail and just stared into the forest, listening to the sounds with wonder. At Mistico you‚Äôll be surrounded by people taking selfies and urged to move along to not clog up the bridges or trails.¬†Otherwise it was nice.  ¬†
* Sky Adventures zip lines: Why do we feel the need to zip line over the jungle? It‚Äôs terrifyingly fun but expensive and ‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôm glad I did it? You‚Äôre going so fast and it's wobbly and hard to enjoy the views. You are not one with nature when doing this. Not sure I would do it again. ¬†
* Ecotermales hot springs. Also conflicted on this one. Exotic and pleasant but maybe overrated and expensive, especially since we had two nice pools at our hotel.¬†
   * Saw a lot of people going in and out of the ""free?"" hot springs near Tabacon and wondered if that would have been fun. Should have done it. 
* Sloths Territory (La Fortuna) - wonderful guided walk and we saw lots of sloths and other creatures!
* Coffee: lots of great local coffee shops serving locally roasted beans. 
   * Take a coffee/chocolate tour if you can, it‚Äôs fun for the family. We did the North Fields tour and it was surprisingly fun and informative. I thought it was big and therefore would be lame. It wasn‚Äôt. You get to try all kinds of treats. Staff is great. 
* La Fortuna waterfall - fun hike up and down over 500 stairs into a river canyon and to this gorgeous waterfall. We couldn‚Äôt swim directly under it due to heavy water flow from rains but that made the falls awesome. We were able to get close enough and swim in the river below. It was way fun, even if a little crowded (go at the end of the day).¬†
* Chante Verde restaurant in La Fortuna. Not in the middle of town but this was probably the best dinner we had on our entire trip. Great for vegetarians and carnivores alike.

Tamarindo area:

* I don't agree with the Tamarindo haters. Yeah it's a bigger town and has a bit of a party vibe but it's no Cancun. It's generally nice, the beach is great, people are cool, and there's lots to do (and eat). 
* Tamarindo Estuary Tour: wonderful mellow boat ride to see crocs, howler monkeys, birds, and much more.¬†
* Sunsets: the best free entertainment and the most beautiful skies I‚Äôve ever seen.¬†Love seeing the people come out every evening to enjoy the beach. 
* Bamboo Sushi in Tamarindo. Delicious, with ambiance, good for special occasions.¬†
* Others in Tamarindo: La Oveja Surf House restaurant and Refugio cafe next door. Also, Cha Cafe. All in the middle of town at the intersection of Cardinal and Central. All very yummy and run by nice people.
* Visit Langosta, just a mile or so up the road. Pretty tide pools and beach. 
* I've now stayed at Witch's Rock Surf Camp (last year) and The Coast hotel (this year). Both are great, on opposite ends of the beach. Both have surfing right out front. Both offer different amenities. I'm glad to have stayed at each. Happy to answer questions. 
   * Volcano Brewing is on the beach in Tamarindo next to Witch's Rock, great place to chill, see live music, and watch the ocean (or a storm).¬†Their pale ale is very good. 
* Surfing! There are waves and surf schools everywhere. Rent a board. Or take a lesson if you‚Äôve never done it before.¬†If renting a board and you're an experienced surfer, pack your favorite fin(s) and a bar of tropical wax.  
   * Beginners: Ask the instructors to teach you proper etiquette as well as technique. They don‚Äôt spend time on this since their job is just to get you to stand up on a board. But you need to know how to enter a lineup and avoid crashing into other surfers that know what they‚Äôre doing. Related: Respect the locals.
* Tired of walking? Land Shark Cart Rentals - pay per trip to rent a golf cart to get around town or to nearby Langosta. It works like a scooter rental. Download the app, scan and go. Costs $5 per trip. Carts are located by the food truck area, near the new Starbucks in town.¬†
   * C'mon, not Starbucks. Drink/support local cafes.¬†
* Leave it better than you found it. Unfortunately there is plastic and other garbage on the beaches and litter around town. When you‚Äôre out for a walk, pick up trash if you can, especially plastic on the beaches. It‚Äôs a terrible scourge. I picked up plastic and cig butts on my morning beach walks.¬†",19,1754953548.0,CostaRicaTravel,4,0.96,False

Day 1:¬†Good morning texts, flirting, hope.  
Day 3:¬†Vibes are immaculate.  
Day 5:¬†Delivery failed recipient‚Äôs inbox is full.  
Day 7:¬†**Ghosted.**

It‚Äôs happening on¬†both¬†sides guys vanish, girls vanish, sometimes both vanish at the same time (which I guess is a ‚Äúmutual haunting‚Äù?).

Meanwhile, those of us who actually want to get married are out here like:  
‚ÄúHello? Is anyone‚Ä¶ alive? Or at least willing to meet for coffee without disappearing into the abyss?‚Äù

The marriage-minded are swiping in circles, the commitment-phobes are thriving, and the only ones having consistent relationships are the DoorDash drivers who see us more than our dates do.

Here‚Äôs the thing this community was made so we can¬†break¬†that cycle. No more trial-week romances that end in ‚Äúuser not found.‚Äù

Instead of ghosting, let‚Äôs:

* **Reply**¬†even if it‚Äôs a ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù (politeness is still free in 2025)
* **Meet halfway** if someone is putting in effort, match it
* **Focus on finding your person**, not collecting pen pals who vanish

We‚Äôre all here because we actually want to find a partner. That‚Äôs rare these days so let‚Äôs not waste it.

Imagine if instead of playing ‚ÄúGuess Who?‚Äù with profiles, we actually connected, talked, and maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe‚Ä¶ planned that¬†real-life¬†coffee date. ‚òï

So, if you‚Äôve been ghosted, haunted, or spooked by modern dating consider this your safe space. Introduce yourself below, say what you‚Äôre looking for, and maybe your forever person is just a scroll away.

Im from the east coast of USA. Usually, I am always able to chat most of the time or day. Looking for any type of chats. Hopefully, it will be more long-term but also down for short-term chats too. I'm down to share photos, too. 

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, and Ark ASA. Just bought Palworld, too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies.",0,1754953421.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

Think more ‚Äúschool lab‚Äù than ‚ÄúBreaking Bad.‚Äù I‚Äôm into stuff like testing water quality, making pH indicators, metal plating, extracting plant pigments, and basically figuring out how the world ticks.

If you have any unused, dusty, or half used chemistry gear laying around ‚Äî solvents, glassware, safety equipment, or old lab tools ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to give it a new home. I can pick up around Alum Rock or meet you somewhere nearby.

I‚Äôm all about safety and responsibility. No shady business here. I‚Äôm happy to swap PC parts or tech gear if you‚Äôre down to barter. And if you want, I can send pics or vids of what I‚Äôm working on so you know your gear isn‚Äôt ending up in a sketchy mess.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm after

* Solvents and reagents (common or rare)
* Glassware: beakers, flasks, funnels, pipettes, chipped or cracked okay if still usable
* Safety gear: gloves, goggles, masks, aprons, safety shields
* Lab tools: hot plates, stands, clamps, magnetic stirrers, mortar and pestle, drying racks, small centrifuge, UV light, infrared thermometers, scales, measuring spoons, coffee filters
* Old chemical storage bottles or containers with labels (empty or partially used)
* pH test kits or strips

**Specific chemicals I could use:**  
Isopropyl alcohol, acetone, citric acid or ascorbic acid, baking soda, washing soda, hydrogen peroxide, glycerin, Epsom salt, copper sulfate, borax, potassium nitrate (fertilizer grade)

Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs dusty, old, or partly used, I can fix or repurpose just about anything. If you have gear from school, old projects, or lab cleanouts, I‚Äôll treat it right.

Community college classes and rent keep my cash tight, so I can‚Äôt pay but I can trade tech and PC parts if you want.

Shoot me a message if you can help or want to swap. Thanks for helping fuel curiosity and legit science in the neighborhood!",0,1754953370.0,SanJose,8,0.33,False

1mns49i,https://www.reddit.com/r/citalopram_celexa/comments/1mns49i/my_advice_to_everyone_who_treats_anxiety_and/,My advice to everyone who treats anxiety and depression.,"Hi guys. I‚Äôm on Citalopram nearly a year. And doing well. But sometimes I pass through crisis, it gets worse and all my anxiety is coming back freaking me out. So I started to observe my life, my habits and diet. And here would like to share with you my observations and hopefully it will be useful. 
 First of all and the most important, especially for those who suffers from anxiety and panics- sugar. The worst enemy. Try to avoid any sweets, soft drinks, even sweeteners . While SSRI is trying to calm your nervous system down, sweets accelerate your brain and make it worse. The same with coffee and chocolate , fruits, honey etc. For brain doesn‚Äôt matter in what form you consume sugar. Even decaf still can have small effect and make you anxious.  
  Do not eat a lot. It‚Äôs a lot of work for your nervous system again. Small portions, plenty of veg and protein. Avoid heavy fat food. Especially in the night time. Last meal 7 pm. If you are fatty, try to loose a few kg and you will feel a lot better, less depressed and happier.
 Another enemy is alcohol. You have to forget about it. Alcohol is a depressant. So it does everything in your body for you to feel bad. It ruins chemical balance in your brain, so even antidepressants won‚Äôt help you. The same with weed and drugs.
  For the last - stress. I know it‚Äôs easy to say, but try to avoid stress. Be conscious in the moment. Stress has brought you to where you are now. You have to learn to react to stress in different way. While you are taking antidepressants and feeling good your brain is learning to be strong and peaceful. Don‚Äôt take it as advantage, change your way to react to stress too. 
   You can have your own habits that ruin your mental health. Try to find them and change.  Don‚Äôt rely on pills only. ",2,1754953307.0,citalopram_celexa,0,1.0,False
