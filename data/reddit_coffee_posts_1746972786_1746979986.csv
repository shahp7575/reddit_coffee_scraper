1kk4kfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1kk4kfr/coworker_is_driving_me_crazy/,Co-Worker is Driving Me Crazy,"I work at a hotel and one of my co-workers will leave the desk for minutes at a time and leave her TikTok videos playing over and over on super loud volume. I've told her to maybe *not* do that, for the sake of the guests and me, but she forgets, and it starts up again the next shift.

I have *never* seen her wash her hands and I know her phone is about to be disgusting so I don't want to have to turn it off for her every time (Yes, I am a tad bit of a germaphobe, I don't like touching other people's phones). It drives me up the wall. Then to find out from my other co-workers that she's calling me bossy and annoying... Then acting all nice to my face.

Like I'm sorry you told me you're **not** **afraid** of germs because you can't see them, and I find that absolutely gross, seeing as we deal with silverware and coffee- sometimes even food. I'm sorry I find it disgusting that you blow your nose in tissues then squish them into the fucking counter next to the computers we all touch, then touch everything without washing or sanitizing. I'm sorry I had to tell you six different times that you HAVE to take ALL the garbage out during your shift, or that you have to greet people kindly and without a sneer, IM SORRY IM SICK OF ITTTTTTTT!

*I'm* the one who has to clean the counters, to clean the disgusting snot mess you leave behind for me in the morning. I'm sorry I say what *everyone else* is thinking, but I'm sick of itttt!!!!

She'll also sit there and talk loudly to herself, and I'm always wondering if she's talking to me or not so I'm always being like ""what? sorry, I didn't catch that."" like, I don't know when you're talking to me or not, because even when you **are** talking to me, you're *not* looking at me and I'm swamped with work BECAUSE YOU JUST SIT THERE AND WATCH TIKTOK!

I will literally be working with a guest, checking them in, and she'll wait RIGHT next to me with her TikTok playing, waiting for me to finish so she can show me it (I've asked her not to do this like three times, but she seemingly forgets). Not only that, but she eats at the desk- and don't get me wrong, so do I, and none of us are supposed to- but working after her is so bad. One day she somehow got doughnut mush pushed into the chair she was in, and it took my co-worker an hour and a half to scrub it out.

I come in almost every day she works before me, to sprinkles and sticky on the phone buttons and keyboard... Mind you, she is like 50 years old and has had a child, so you'd think she'd know not to do these things. It's really horrible and she just doesn't care. Then acts all fine in front of my boss... I don't get why she's still working here.

The way she reacts when you respectfully ask her to stop doing something is like watching a child be told 'no' it's embarrassing and just... I don't know. And no one is willing to say anything to her, and HR IS our boss who isn't doing shit about it so idk man. I'm quite fed up but also so thankful I've stopped working with her as much.

By the third week of Theo’s papacy—if one could still call it that—the Vatican had acquired a goat.

No one admitted to bringing it in. No one claimed to have seen it arrive. It simply was, munching solemnly on the blood roses outside the Apostolic Palace, like some horned, holy riddle in the garden. It stared at Theo with rectangular pupils and chewed in slow, prophetic rhythm, its beard slick with dew and menace.

Crivens, his so-called advisor, shrugged at the beast like one might acknowledge a misprinted bulletin. “Minor miracle,” he offered. “Could be worse. Last rogue incarnation involved a flaming ostrich.”

Theo blinked twice. “And nobody thinks this is… odd?”

“Oh, we all think it’s odd,” Crivens said cheerfully. “But oddness is Vatican Standard Operating Procedure. Frankly, you’d be more suspicious if things were normal.”

The goat bleated. The sound echoed like an accusation.

—

They led Theo down spiral steps beneath the basilica. With every level, the walls grew tighter, the air denser. The torches flared with an unnatural chill, casting shadows that whispered prayers in forgotten tongues. Crivens handed him a ceremonial handkerchief soaked in holy water and fear.

“You’re here,” Crivens said, “to consult with the Council of Whispering Relics. It’s customary for popes facing ecclesiastical crises, existential dread, or persistent hoofed omens.”

Theo muttered something about needing caffeine and an exorcist. But the chamber awaited.

It was a crypt, a vault, a fevered museum curated by mad monks over millennia. Bones in glass. Toes wrapped in velvet. A sandal suspended mid-air, twirling slowly. In the center: a pedestal with a mummified finger—possibly Saint Polycarp, possibly someone’s embalmed breadstick—humming.

Then came the whispers.

Not metaphorical whispers. Literal, multilingual, discordant voices emanating from the relics.

“You call that an encyclical?” the finger rasped in Latin. “I’ve seen heretics draft better theology in crayon.”

“Theo is a nickname, not a name,” hissed a shrunken skull, spinning like a judgmental disco ball.

“A disgrace,” spat the sandal, “I died for this Church, and he can’t even wear socks that match.”

Theo stared, wide-eyed. “Is this… is this normal?!”

Crivens glanced at his watch. “More or less. The relics haven’t tried to sue anyone this week, so you’re actually doing alright.”

—

Back in his quarters, the goat had scratched spirals into the lawn with unsettling precision. Latin script, etched into dirt. The sky had turned a little too red. Not sunset-red. Apocalyptic-wine-dark-and-moaning-red.

Theo didn’t speak to the goat. He glared at it. The goat licked its lips and, for a moment, seemed to hum the opening bars of Ave Maria.

Inside, his papal mitre—yes, the hat—had begun to whisper.

“You’re not made for holiness,” it purred in a voice like molasses and cigarette ash. “You’re scaffolding for divine disappointment.”

Theo threw it across the room. It hit the wall and sighed.

“Drama queen,” the hat muttered.

—

Things got worse when the floor tiles rearranged themselves into cryptic anagrams. “NOT THE REAL POPE,” they spelled. “ASK THE GOAT.” “UNHOLY UNO CHAMP.”

His coffee transformed into wine. Then back into coffee. Then into a viscous black sludge labeled “Papal Brew: Dark Night of the Soul Edition.”

The Swiss Guard began chanting in their sleep—Gregorian remixes layered with Eurotrash techno. One of them breakdanced during Lauds.

Crivens filed a form to investigate. Estimated time of bureaucratic resolution: 17 years.

—

Theo’s breaking point came in the middle of the night.

He awoke to find the relics had mailed themselves to his chambers.

Not metaphorically.

There was a knock. He opened the door.

A nun stood holding a crate.

“Delivery for His Holiness,” she said. “Marked ‘urgent spiritual collapse.’ Sign here.”

Inside the box: the relics. Muttering. Glowing faintly.

“The walls remember, Theo,” murmured the mummified finger. “You were not chosen. You were leaked into existence.”

“I have so many questions,” Theo whispered.

“Oh, good,” replied the sandal. “We love a dramatic existential unraveling.”

Outside, the goat bleated once.

And the floor quaked.

Not an earthquake. Not exactly.

But a Vatican shift. Reality slumped sideways. The walls inhaled. Cardinals melted at the edges of his vision like slow-burning candles, their robes pooling in waxy puddles. Theo backed away, but the world tilted with him.

His mitre climbed back up the nightstand, clinging like a lover.

“You are not the Pope,” it whispered, with the sweetness of a guillotine. “You are the Question.”

—

In the garden, the goat stared at the moon, then turned to face the empty sky.

English is not my first language. This will also be a long post so please bear with me.

Until very recently, I (23M) considered I had two best friends, Lyla (23F) and Misty (23F). Before anyone makes any assumptions (because I know how Reddit is sometimes), there is absolutely no romantic feelings involved between me and them. I'm gay and have been out since before I met them, and I know for a fact that they don't find me attractive either. We met in 9th grade, were classmates in our hometown, and became friends fairly easily; we had very similar interests and already had mutual friends. We've been friends for almost 10 years, and while we've had our ups and downs, we've never had any serious issues or fights. We know each other's families; their parents like me, and mine like them; in short, we've had a long and very close friendship, but I've noticed that it's changed a lot in the past few months.

Since last year, I've realized that much of our friendship has been maintained primarily through my own efforts. Most of the time we see each other is because I invite them out to coffee shops and the like, but they rarely invite me to anything. Through social media, I've seen that they see each other almost every week, multiple times a week, at Lyla's apartment. It's not like they just see each other, but they also hang out with both of their boyfriends and three or four other friends. They haven't invited me to their weekly get-togethers even once. To be fair, I have been invited to larger gatherings, like Misty's birthday party, where she had about 20 or 30 guests. The party was held at Lyla's apartment, and while we were still pretty close at that point, I still felt like a big part of the reason she invited me was because it would have looked bad to have a big celebration and not tell me, since we've been friends for many years.

Up until then, we'd still been talking fairly frequently on social media, and I'd see them about once a month (when I invited them out). When I realized they weren't even considering me for their get-togethers, I decided to see if they'd get in touch if I stopped texting for a while. Misty hasn't texted me in two months, and Lyla has a couple of times. I'd been meaning to tell them I felt very left out, but it never seemed like the right time to talk about it because they've been very busy with college and I didn't want to give them another thing to worry (I finished college last year, Lyla finished her first degree this year, and Misty just started grad school).

However, last week Lyla added me to a group chat to share information about her birthday party, which was last Friday. She has about 40 guests, and like with Misty's party, I thought one of the reasons she invited me was to save face. I decided it was time to talk to Lyla about it, since I would have felt bad about going to her house upset, so I texted her, telling her how I felt and asking if she really wanted me to be there or if the invitation was just out of obligation. She said she regretted I felt left out and that the reason we were distant was that she didn't stay in touch with her friends constantly, and she didn't talk to anyone much (which I know isn't true because, as I mentioned earlier, she and Misty hang out several times a week and also hang out with other friends at those gatherings). We eventually agreed to remain friends even if things changed over time, and I would let her know if I could join her for her birthday party. Days later, I decided I wasn’t comfortable attending her party, so I messaged the group chat saying that I wouldn’t be able to make it to the event, wished everyone a good time and left the group. Then, On Friday morning, I wrote to Lyla wishing her a happy birthday and, once again, a good time at her party. She still hasn't responded, and I'm starting to feel like I could have handled the situation better, from how I felt to not attending the event.

***INTEL REPORT***

Pictured is a Shadowsword Superheavy Tank hunter operated by the Heretic host known as the Remade.

It is surmised by Imperial intelligence that this Vehicle was formally B3494368835/B32* 'His Voice Personified'. Built on Agripinaa, issued to the Tyris 10th 'Steel Janissaries', and one of nearly a dozen Superheavy class tanks thought to have fallen into the hands of the Archenemy during the disastrous evacuation of the 12th Army group from Pentagaro. 

It is believed that the 10th was overrun in it's entirety at their embarkation site south of Berus Secundus Hive after the heavy landing craft sent to extract them were destroyed en-route by Archenemy airbourne hunter packs.

The refit of any baneblade chassis tank is no small task and it is likely this vehicle, along with several other captured and salvaged examples were shipped to Chambaris for repairs in its captured manufactories.

From extrapolation of pict evidence it can be surmised that this particular vehicle suffered a penetrating hit to the front glacis that disabled the drivers position and immobilised the tank.

Therefore most of the Traitor's attention to repairs can be seen at the front of the vehicle where it has been sheathed in a skin of composite plates which themselves have been covered with a thick layer of anti-magnetic paste, this may be intended to mitigate the use of substandard armour plate in the repair process. Under the skin it is almost a certainty that the front fighting compartment is of unsanctioned, non-standard design, further evidenced by the remote twin linked heavy bolter having been replaced with a pintle weapon on a rotating cupola that has been fitted in place of the standard hatch.

It is likely this tank also suffered damage to one of its sponsons, as evidenced by the retro-fitment of a non-standard pattern Lascannon to the starboard mounting.

Pictured here on the colony world of Peshin II and now bearing the moniker 'Breath of the Magister', this Shadowsword was used to obliterate both the command Bastion and the main gate at Flanders reach, the local milita having nothing in their arsenal capable of mounting serious opposition. 

Despite having been refitted only around two standard terran years ago (adjusted for realtime) at the taking of these Picts, the Shadowsword is already showing telltale signs of an insidious chaos corruption to its physical form following it's Dedication to the greater power of the archenemy pantheon commonly known as *Redacted* . It is therefore highly unlikely that the Mechanicus would attempt a reconsecration of 'His Voice Personified' should it fall back into Imperial possession despite it's great value and storied history. 

Although clearly in a poor state of repair and unlikely to be capable of operating in anything like optimal condition, a Shadowsword in working order still remains an incredibly powerful asset for a warband that possesses the necessary technical knowledge and logistics to field it.",2,1746979228.0,RenegadesHeretics,0,1.0,False

Although clearly in a poor state of repair and unlikely to be capable of operating in anything like optimal condition, a Shadowsword in working order still remains an incredibly powerful asset for a warband that possesses the necessary technical knowledge and logistics to field it.",5,1746979164.0,TraitorGuard,0,1.0,False

1kk4atl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1kk4atl/surah_muzammil_effects/,Surah Muzammil effects,"Surah Muzammil

Recently was told by my family that it is good to read surah Muzammil 11 times after Fajr for rizq so I started reading that around a month back. But now I'm sat here wondering if anyone has noticed any effects of this surah on them?
For example, I've noticed ever since I started, I've been very consistent with my night ibadah to the point where I don't miss it at all (allahamdulilah). Even if I sleep at 12am, I'm sharply woken up at 1.30-2am for ibadah. And I just cannot bring myself to do the little sins (like lying etc) just because the guilt is a bit overwhelming. I feel like the surah is pulling me towards reading the Quran, however much I want, more consistently. Sometimes when I asked for guidance in the Dua after reciting it, I have received it immediately and with a clarity that has truly astounded meband my family (a recent istikhara for someone was such an example). I've started Dhikr consistently and sometimes the Dhikr I need just gets directed to me or like comes to me when I'm making Dua in Salah.

That being said, I've also noticed some negative effects that nobody in my family is quite sure why is happening. I might be a bit dizzy too though (not sure about it yet).. it's like a backwards pull when I do Salah or anything as such. Sometimes when I'm doing Dhikr, I feel like my heart sinks. 

And the big one: sometimes doing ibadah (Dhikr, Salah, Quran recitation) is so scary... It's like the fear just envelopes my heart and I need to really push through. For example even reading this Surah is like such a feat (my mum has told me that it takes her a minute or so to read it but for me, it take me around 4 mins on those hard days). 

Has anyone experienced any of this? My mum says that it's just my waswasa and it might be the coffee and exam stress.. but I am really worried because I genuinely didn't even start reading it for rizq entirely but so that Allah can be happy from me. ",2,1746979106.0,MuslimCorner,1,1.0,False

AI is not the biggest water consumer.,"I'm so tired of people being against AI due to ""harming the environment"" as if there aren't significantly larger water consumers that absolutely outnumber the amount of water AI consumes. When the world eventually ends, no one is gonna be blaming AI. 

It takes about 5 gallons of water to produce one singular walnut. 

The United States produces about 608 metric tons of walnuts anually, translating to about 73.5 million walnuts produced daily.

This means 367.5 million gallons of water are used daily, only for walnut production.

Google data centers such as google drive and gmail only accumulate about 550,000 gallons of water daily to cool down their system.

ChatGBT utilizes about 39 million gallons of water a day to cool down their data centers. Which is still **9 times less** than the water used for walnut production.

We don't fucking need walnuts, and we don't really need AI either, but walnuts are something that we certainly can live without that causes more harm to the earths water supply over AI.

Same goes for coffee production. About 37 gallons per cup. Over 2 billion cups of coffee are consumed daily worldwide. That's 74 billion gallons of water used daily. Not even a scratch on what AI uses for cooling systems. The amount of water AI utilities in a YEAR isn't as high as the amount of water used for coffee on a DAILY BASIS.

I live in a well off area on the border with Belgium and the Netherlands, I'm surrounded by millionaires and I'm pretty sure that I'm the poorest person in the area, ah well. It was december near Christmas at around 21:00 when somebody rang the doorbell which is at the gate and my stepson runs out to it to answer it he was about 12 at the time. I'm not going to lie I had a few drinks. There was an Asian women and a white looking boy that I would estimate about 12\~13 and the women about late 30's. She did not look related to the boy at all. 



As any Dutch person knows it rarely snows here but it does happen, it had for the last few days back then (about 4 years ago) anyway their car got stuck in the mud and snow and they asked for help. I asked them why ask me? Why not just call the ANWB or something? And she she said that she saw my car in the driveway so she figured I could help. Being a rural kinda guy I invited them in to warm up and have a thee or coffee and they did. They warmed up and I offered to pull their car out of the mud with my Landrover.



The roads around here are fine but there are some mud roads that a navigation systems like Google will just tell you to use because it's fine but sometimes they get very muddy and are really more for tractors or pedestrians. 



The weather was awful and it was dark but we found the stupid little Hyundai stuck so deep in snow and mud it was silly. Now I'm also a mechanic by trade so I know what I'm doing, those little shitbox cars always need a towing iron to screw into the front or back and it's supposed to be with the spare wheel in the back but it wasn't. So I open the glovebox to see it's it there. The boy objected to me doing this and while being very protective of his carer and very suspicous of me, mind you in the cold and snow and wind I disgraraded him. Inside the glove box is the tow thing and also a box of Durex 144 condoms and it's open. In all of my 20 years being a mechanic I have never seen that or known that even exists but who am I to judge? Asian women likes to party I figured.



So I install the tow thing and pull that stupid little car out of the snow bank she drove in and follow her to a safer road incase they get stick again. I high five my stepson for doing a good job and getting to safety with my cool big car.

Later it hit me, I'm a fucking idiot I should have called the cops.

Cue the burnt offerings to the coffee gods. I’m talking sputters, stalls, scorched grounds, and enough bitterness to fuel a soap opera. I was brewing disaster in a pot.

Desperate and over-caffeinated, I turned to this subreddit, and y’all came through. Fast forward to today—I finally made my first legit, smooth, non-sputtering, non-burnt batch of liquid gold. It flowed. It smelled amazing. I may or may not have cried a little.

Thanks for all the stories, pics, videos, and unrelenting moka pot wisdom. You kept me inspired (and mildly obsessed), and now I’m one cup closer to Italian grandma status.

1kk3znd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1kk3znd/can_the_3m_aquapure_whole_house_water_filter/,Can the 3M Aqua-Pure Whole House Water Filter Improve Your Home? Full Review,"**Exceptional Filtration and Performance**  
As someone obsessed with pure drinking water, the 3M 5621006 Aqua-Pure Whole House Water Filter has been an interesting addition to my home. Let me just say, this is far from your ordinary filter. It’s designed to cater to a whole household, not just a single faucet, and in my experience, it genuinely feels like an upgrade to every tap in the house. The promise of reducing chlorine taste, odor, and sediment was enticing, and after testing it, I can confirm that it over-delivers in some areas.  

**Streamlined Design and Build**  
The elongated cartridge design, while initially intimidating, quickly became a favorite aspect. It’s undeniably sleek but also meaningful in its construction. Compactly measuring 4.06"" in diameter and 20.06"" in height, it wasn’t difficult to install in my utility room. The durable build is evident, a testament to quality as expected of 3M. This thing even exudes reliability—hard to fault a product built with activated carbon material (a superior choice for reducing chlorine and impurities). Handling it during setup, I also noted its manageable weight of 5.95 pounds, a welcome surprise given its functionality.  

**Ease of Installation and Maintenance**  
One of the standout features has to be the Sanitary Quick Change (SQC) design. I didn’t have to hunt down tools or call my plumber friend for help—thank goodness. No filter wrench required? Yes, please! Replacing the cartridge for the first time was nearly effortless, and for someone who usually hates dealing with maintenance, this was a game-changer. There’s a remarkable level of convenience in not having to touch any part of the internal media during replacements. I’d mark this as one of the biggest highlights of this system.

[Check 3M 5621006 Aqua-Pure Whole House Water Filter price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b005xa9sve/)

**Great Water Quality and Taste**  
Here’s where the product earned my respect—it’s not just better water, it’s impressively better water. Whether it was filling up my kids’ water bottles, brewing coffee, or even taking a shower, the improvement was unmistakable. The stark reduction in chlorine taste, odor, and sediment was almost immediate. My appliances, especially the dishwasher and washing machine, seemed to thank me silently with their enhanced performance (or maybe I imagined that, who knows?).  

**Positives**  
The benefits just kept adding up as I tested this filter:  
- NSF Standard 42 certification ensures high-quality filtration.  
- Capable of handling a fantastic 100,000-gallon threshold.  
- Filters water at a flow rate of 10 gallons per minute (GPM).  
- Minimal to no noticeable reduction in pressure during peak use.  

**Considerations and Downsides**  
That said, no product is without its areas for improvement, and the Aqua-Pure isn't exempt. While reliable, here’s what I’ve noted:  
- Replacement cartridges can feel a bit pricey if you’re on a tight budget.  
- Not designed to tackle heavy-hard water issues—it focuses more on chlorine, sediment, etc.  
- Occasional leakage problems were reported in some reviews, although I personally didn't experience this.  

**Competing Products**  
Looking at other options in the same category, it’s clear the Aqua-Pure has carved out an impressive niche for itself. Compared to filters like the Culligan WH-HD200-C or the GE GXWH40L, the Aqua-Pure wins in ease of maintenance and high water flow capacity. Where some other systems can feel clunky or overly complex, this unit’s streamlined design and advanced SQC are unmatched. That said, the competitors might edge ahead when it comes to pricing, especially for customers searching for a budget-friendly entry-point solution.

**Cost-Effectiveness and Long-Term Value**  
Is it worth it in the grand scheme of things? While 3M’s whole-house water filter isn’t the cheapest option out there, its longevity and performance justify the price. Having to swap out the cartridge only after filtering up to 100,000 gallons adds substantial value. If you care about consistent quality and convenience (especially with fast-change perks), investing in this product feels like smart spending. Plus, the peace of mind knowing it’s keeping both your family and appliances safe is pretty priceless.

Now imagine a country with 15,000+ kilometers of land border, surrounded by seven very different neighbors, ranging from friendly to… not-so-friendly.

Welcome to India’s border challenge—a high-stakes game of chess, where strategy, security, and sometimes even snowstorms decide the next move.

Borders aren't just lines on a map. They are more than geographical divisions. They are zones where security, sovereignty, diplomacy, development, and danger all collide. They're the gates through which people, goods, and ideas move in and out of a country. But borders can also be danger zones—where conflict, smuggling, illegal migration, and even terrorism happen. That’s why every country, including India, needs a strong and smart border policy strategy.

For a country as vast and geopolitically complex as India, managing its borders is not just a defence imperative—it's a national priority.

India’s border policy strategy is undergoing a shift—from reactive guarding to proactive and smart management. In this blog, we’ll break down what makes a good border policy, India’s current approach, its challenges, and what needs to evolve—with real data, expert insights, and simple explanations.

So how does India manage this complex puzzle? Let’s decode the secrets of India’s Border Policy Strategy—with tech, troops, tunnels, and tons of facts.




I. Why Borders Matter

India’s borders are not just long—they’re legendary. Our nation has one of the longest and most complex borders in the world. We share borders with:

Pakistan and China with whom India already has military tentions, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal & Bhutan, Afghanistan (via PoK)

Fact bomb: India’s total land border = 15,106 km
Coastal boundary = 7,516 km
That’s like trying to guard over 22,000 km of front yard!
Each segment brings unique strategic, political, and socio-economic challenges.

According to IDSA:

> “Border management cannot be military-only. It requires infrastructure, local participation, legal clarity, and cooperative diplomacy.”




Challenges India Faces at Its Borders:

1. China (LAC - Line of Actual Control):
Tensions have increased, especially after the Galwan Valley clash in 2020, where 20 Indian soldiers died. The border isn't clearly marked, making things worse.

2. Pakistan (LoC - Line of Control):
Terrorism, cross-border firing, and infiltration are major concerns.

3. Bangladesh and Nepal Borders:
These are softer borders but face issues like illegal migration and smuggling.

Other challenges include : 

62% of India’s border is land-based; the rest is coastal.
India has over 1,000 border outposts.
More than 1,50,000 troops are stationed at borders.
90% of India’s border areas are in tough terrain like deserts, mountains, and jungles.




II. Types of Indian Borders and Their Strategic Importance

Country :- 

Bangladesh : 
Border length - 4096 km
Key challenges - smuggling, illegal migration 

China : 
Border length - 3488(LAC) km
Key challenges - Border standoff, unclear demarcation 

Pakistan :
Border length - 3323(LoC & IB) km
Key challenges - Terror infiltration, ceasefire violations 

Nepal : 
Border length - 1751 km
Key challenges - Open border, rising political sensitivities 

Mayanmar : 
Border length - 1643 km
Key challenges - Unsergency spillover, drugs, arms

Bhutan : 
Border length - 699 km
Key challenges - Relatively stable

Afganistan(via PoK) : 
Border length - 103 km
Key challenges - Occupied territories, terror routes




III. The Key Pillars of a Smart Border Strategy

1. Technology-Driven Surveillance

Modern border control is not about more boots, but smarter eyes.

Old School Strategy: Barbed wires, rifles, guard posts.
New School Strategy: Drones, radars, AI cameras, and satellite eyes.

India has launched the Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) to turn borders into virtual fortresses. Think of it like a smart security app, but for the entire nation. It has been deployed along the Indo-Pak and Indo-Bangladesh borders. It includes:

Infrared sensors
Thermal imagers to spot movement at night
UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to scan the Himalayas
Ground surveillance radar that detect footsteps
Command and control centres for real-time alerts


Quote from IDSA:

> “India’s border strategy must embrace intelligent surveillance over increased deployment.”
> “Tech-enabled border systems reduce manpower burden, improve efficiency, and are key in areas where terrain or climate restricts movement.”
>""India must integrate technological solutions like AI-powered surveillance to reduce manpower strain and increase accuracy.""

Fact: As of 2023, over 60 border outposts along the India-Bangladesh border are fully CIBMS-integrated.





2. Strategic Infrastructure Development

Guess how do you move troops in a snowstorm? 
You build roads that laugh at the weather.

The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is critical to India’s border strategy. This organisation is India’s real-life Minecraft team, carving highways through mountains, deserts, and jungles.

BRO built 4,200 km of roads in the northeast and Ladakh since 2014.

Some of their jaw dropping constructions include :
Inaugurated the Atal Tunnel (Rohtang): World’s longest highway tunnel above 10,000 ft.
Sela Tunnel: Opening soon to cut hours off the journey to China border.
They created nearly 300 bridges for rapid troop and logistics movement.

The Diplomat said it best:

> “In war, speed wins. And speed comes from good roads.”
> “Inaccessibility has historically been India’s greatest vulnerability. Infrastructure is not just a convenience—it is strategy.”




3. Integrated Forces with Defined Jurisdiction

India’s border guarding forces operate in difficult terrains:

Force :- 
BSF :
Border assigned - Pakistan and Bangladesh 
Key role - Counter infiltration, anti smuggling 

ITBP :
Border assigned - China (LAC)
Key role - High altitude surveillance 

SSB :
Border assigned - Nepal and Bhutan
Key role - People movement monitoring

Assam Rifles :
Border assigned - Mayanmar 
Key role - Counter insurgency 

Indian Army : 
Border assigned - LoC and LAC (when necessary)
Key role - Conflict response 

These forces don’t just fight—they rescue villagers, stop drug runners, and even rescue cows!

The government also aims to unify command structures, improve coordination between BSF, Army, and state police, especially during crises.

As per The Diplomat:

>""Border soldiers are often India's first line of defense. Neglecting their morale is a long-term strategic risk.""




4. Community-Based Border Management

Imagine living in a village where gunfire is a lullaby.

Border areas often suffer from poor roads, few jobs, and migration. To fix this and since the locals are often the first to notice suspicious movement. India is now investing in community-focused initiatives. 
India started the : 
Civic Action Programmes: Forces interact with locals to build trust, gather intelligence, and offer basic services.
The Vibrant Villages Programme in 2023: It covers 662 villages in Arunachal, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Ladakh, and Sikkim. These villages get infrastructure, WiFi, solar lights, health centres schools, and economic support.
     It's aim? Discourage migration and keep            locals rooted and connected. A strong.              village is a strong border.


Diplomatic wisdom:

> “A well-fed, proud villager is better security than a battalion.”
> “Border development is national integration in action. Neglecting locals turns them into liabilities; engaging them makes them sentinels.”




5. Diplomacy, Treaties, and Confidence-Building Measures

India’s border policy is not always ""guns blazing."" Sometimes, it’s about coffee, flags, and handshakes. India uses a mix of talks, flag meetings, military hotlines, and pacts to maintain peace

With Pakistan: 
-A 2021 ceasefire agreement along the LoC is largely holding.

With China: 
-Despite the 2020 Galwan clash, multiple rounds of Corps Commander-level talks have led to partial disengagement in some zones. Tense, but talking. 

With Bangladesh: 
-2015 Land Boundary Agreement resolved long-standing disputes peacefully. 
-Border fencing and migration pacts have improved ties.


The Diplomat rightly says:

> “A calm border is built in negotiation rooms, not bunkers.”
> “A border should not be just a line of control—it should be a line of communication.”
>""The border should not be the frontline of war, but a bridge of dialogue.""




IV. Border-Related Threats and Stats

Threat - Terrorist infiltration(LoC)
Recent stats - Over 120 attempts foiled in 2023

Threat - Smuggling (Bangladesh border)
Recent stats - Rs 250+ crore worth of goods seized in 2022

Threat - Illegal migration 
Recent stats - Over 35,000 people detained along various borders in 2022

Threat - Drone sightseeings (Punjab & Jammu)
Recent stats - ~450 incidents in 2023 alone 

Threat - Narcotics seizures 
Recent stats - BSF seized over 3300 kg of drugs along borders in 2023

Other theats involve : 

Terrorism & Infiltration (Mostly Pakistan)

-120+ infiltration attempts in 2023.
-Terror launchpads near LoC still active.


Smuggling & Drones (Punjab, J&K, Northeast)

-450+ drone sightings in 2023.

-Major burden on border states like Assam, West Bengal.


Narcotics Trade

-BSF seized 3,300+ kg of narcotics in 2023 alone.




V. But what's Still Missing?

1. Poor Border Demarcation

India lacks fully agreed borders with China (LAC) and parts of Nepal.
Even with Pakistan, Sir Creek remains disputed.


2. Manpower Shortage

According to parliamentary reports, many border posts are under-staffed or lack high-altitude trained personnel.


3. Lack of Uniformity in Laws

Different rules apply in different border areas—causing confusion in coordination and response.
Different borders = different rules = confusion.


4. Environmental Damage

Infrastructure development without ecological planning is hurting border biodiversity (e.g., in Arunachal, Uttarakhand).
Roads must protect wildlife too.


Troop Fatigue

Harsh climates and long posts strain mental health.




VI. Conclusion: A Border Strategy That Looks Inward and Outward

The Great Wall of India Is a Work of Art and War

India’s border policy is no longer just about fencing and guarding the gate—it’s about combining military strength, tech intelligence, grassroots support, and diplomacy creating a smart, secure, and humane perimeter that balances defense, development, diplomacy, and dignity.

It’s a strategy that watches from the skies, listens through sensors, moves on mountains, and speaks across tables.
Because protecting India isn’t just about who’s on the outside—it’s also about how we care for those living on the inside.

A good border policy keeps enemies out, but also keeps people in—connected, secure, and valued.

> “India’s borders must be protected by more than guns—by governance, development, and dignity.” — Strategic Affairs Analyst at IDSA

But anyway I need to get this off my chest. I don’t really have anyone in my life I can say this to—definitely not my family or relatives.

I grew up with a father who has PTSD and, I’m fairly sure, narcissistic personality disorder. He centered everything around himself, he didn't allow my mother to finish Uni because he didn't want her to work and be independant. He hid stuff that didn't belong to him, so we, his children would come to him and ask if he's seen them. Living with him felt like walking through a minefield every day. The smallest mistake, the tiniest accident, and he'd explode. 

Once I broke an old fan by accident. It was nothing major, just a small household item—but he lost it. He screamed at me, called me a “little shit,” and told me I destroyed something he worked hard for. That wasn’t an isolated incident. That was just the norm. My mother hid broken stuff from him, or took responsibility so he won't scream at us, but scream at her.

One time I came home a little late during summer—9 PM, barely even dark out—and he beat me with a whip. He beat me so hard that he broke it, he broke at least 3 of these on my body when I was a teenager.  
And then there were the mornings. Almost every day, I’d wake up to my parents ""arguing"", like a fricking clock.  
  
It affected me in a negative way, I was always seeking to be ""Convenient"", not to be a problem. I never asked for anything. I tried to predict what would make him angry and avoid it at all costs. I became hyper-aware of everyone’s moods, because I had to be.

He wasn't all time evil douche, he cared enough to put food on the table, pay for my PC and clothing. I saw worse father, but it doesn't help to recongise this.

**Recent events:**   
So anyway, fast forward to this January. My father had a stroke. I was the only one home with him when it happened. I found him collapsed on the floor, confused and barely responsive. I called the ambulance, picked him up, and did everything I could to help. Since I was the only one in the house, my responsibility kicked in, and the next 24 hours I was on auto-pilot. I kinda hate that I did though, I took care of the man who had tormented me and my mother for most of our lives. I thought maybe, just maybe, there was some redemption possible—especially since in the past four years, he had quieted down. He wasn’t as aggressive, wasn’t shouting like he used to. I thought the psycho part of him was over.   
They told us it was an ischemic stroke. The MRI showed that half his brain was just dark. And somehow, what came out of that hospital wasn’t a weakened version of him, but the *old* him, brought back to life. Worse, even.

We spent 15 days in the hospital. He was confused at times, sometimes aggressive, but we managed. But once we got home, it turned into hell.

For three months straight, he didn’t let us sleep more than 4 to 6 hours a night. He’d scream—*literally scream*—for hours, sometimes with no words at all. He’d threaten us constantly—telling us he was going to kill us, break our arms, beat us senseless. I used up every bit of savings I had taking care of him: medications, special food, transportation, everything. He's having mood swings, saying how he's grateful and after 20 minutes has passed he'd curse me with every bad word he knows. He'd call my mother a slut/whore, bring up her passed sister and brothers who died because of the cancer calling them all sorts of stuff, he's constantly talking shit and makes everyone around him miserable, even his own mother (86F) is ashamed of him.

When relatives came over, he’d lie straight to their faces, That we were beating him, neglecting him. We never laid a finger on him. We were exhausted, my mother(65F) had to start to take heart medication because of him. 

He’d scream at me about how *nothing* in this house belongs to me, even after I spent my *last* savings trying to keep him alive and comfortable. He tells me he’s going to sell the house, leave us with nothing, and take whatever’s left for himself. And then he really twists the knife—calls me a loser, says I’ll never be anything, that even my friends are ashamed to be around me.  
And the worst part is, a small part of me believes it. My friends are tired of my whining. I don’t know how to “earn big money” like some people do. I’m not some high-paid professional with a dream career and financial security. But what I *did* earn, I used where it mattered. When my brother got into a car accident and couldn’t work for three years, I helped him. I feed him and his family(wife and a kid), while that ass of the father refused to work to help him out because he's already retired. This is already a 4 year where I'm giving up everything I saved to a family member.

I feel that I'm a idiot in this story, I feel like I betrayed myself and my mother by saving him. I saved him because I thought that’s what a decent person should do. I don’t know how to cope with this. I’m drained emotionally, mentally, and financially. It's the first time I was thinking about killing a father, and it's a disgusting thought, but being sleep deprived for so long, I dont know what to think anymore. What makes it even worse is what I had to give up because of him. I had a long-term contract lined up—something stable, something that could’ve helped me build a life of my own. But I had to let it go. I couldn’t manage the stress of caregiving and work. There was no space for both. So now, not only am I emotionally ruined and financially drained, but I’m also watching my own future slip away because I chose to help someone who is now eating my brain everyday. 

I was thinking about killing him for some time, I know I won't do that, but part of me just wants him gone. He's a terrible person, and I wish he'd never met my mother. People like him shouldn't breed. And I'm disgusted to be him offspring.

If you’ve been through anything like this—living with a narcissistic or abusive parent, trying to survive caregiving when you’re already broken, giving until there’s nothing left—how did you make it through? How did you start putting your life back together?

Even if you don’t have advice, just knowing someone read this and understands would help more than you know.

I am 21w 2days and everything was going fine until I hit 20 weeks exactly and suddenly my feet & ankles began to swell & ache if I'm even on them for 30 minute increments and now I'm suffering from pregnancy carpal tunnel so bad that I have to wear braces 24/7, can't even make a pot of coffee & my hands and feet are constantly falling asleep w a pins & needles feeling. I've completely lost grip strength in my hands as well, can't make a fist. I thought this would happen 8-9 mos of pregnancy, was not expecting it to happen the second I hit 5 months.

I am really freaked out about being able to work (I do teletherapy from home) because using my keyboard & mouse has become agonizing. My partner has been having to do everything including opening my water bottles, the laundry, errands, etc. I also have Kaiser and have heard that Kaiser doctors won't fill out disability paperwork. 

My father in law is supposed to take us out to Benihana for mothers day but with the state I'm in, I don't even want to go. 

I've tried tylenol which does nothing, elevating my feet which doesn't seem to make a difference, ice and splints & compression socks.  The idea of 4 more months of this is enough to send me into a crying spell.  The biggest consolation is that our anatomy scan went well & thankfully baby is doing very well so far, which I don't take for granted.

I assume this is due to my age (42), I am a first time mom so this is my first & only pregnancy. From what I can tell, not a lot of other pregnant woman are going through what I am.

So me (26F) and my husband (M26) have been married for about 8 months now. Alhamd. we are quite happy together and there hasn't really been anything about him that I haven't liked so far.. But there's something about him that is kinda bugging me.. 

So a few days ago we were lying in bed and just having a conversation about things. Which shifted to the topic of; ""What career we wanted to pursue but couldn't"" and he said that he wanted to be a veterinarian. But couldn't because it would've been really difficult financial wise where we live. 

Then we kinda talked about this a bit more, when suddenly he dropped a pretty big statement saying;

""It's difficult for me to feel empathy for humans, and i would personally feel bad more about an animal's death than a human...""

And I felt quite... i don’t know repelled by that ig? But at that moment i didn't say anything to him about it..

A few days later, I had been done with ironing the clothes and was sitting down to watch some TV. And he was downstairs working on our motor, when he suddenly came upstairs, opened the fridge, took some milk and took it downstairs.

I noticed but didn't say anything about it, and a few minutes later he came back up said;

""There was such a cute stray doggy outside! He looked hungry and thirsty so I got some milk for him""

And so I kinda explained to him that we might have to keep getting milk again and again if that dog keeps coming back, and it might make budgeting a bit difficult. to which he replied;

""I mean it's alright.. we don't have a baby yet so that milk not too important right?"" While giggling.

( He usually cracks jokes and is a funny person overall, but this didn't really feel funny to me.. )

And yeah we don't have a baby yet, but I drink coffee and he drinks tea every day. So saying its ""not too important"" felt kinda weird..

I know being kind to animals and stuff is a good dead and all, but I don't know why but he seems to be a bit too over possessive about it..

Like I know he said he grew up with pets since a very young age, and he also told me that his father was kinda cruel and used to throw their cats outside quote alot because ""he git sick of them at a point"" and sometimes they didn't return.

As someone who has spent countless hours strumming chords and testing gear, I was genuinely curious about what this guitar had to offer. It certainly didn’t disappoint, though there are a few things to think about before making it your go-to instrument.

**Stunning Design and Aesthetic Appeal**

Right out of the case, this acoustic-electric guitar grabs your attention with its striking mahogany finish. The figured mahogany on the high-pressure laminate (HPL) top, back, and sides doesn’t just look premium—it also manages to give the guitar an authentic visual warmth. It perfectly mirrors the grain lines typically associated with higher-end mahogany. The natural color adds a timeless elegance, making it well-suited for players performing on stage or showcasing a bit of flair during recording sessions at home. My friends couldn’t stop commenting on how impressive it looked sitting in my living room.

[Check Martin D-X1E Mahogany Acoustic-electric Guitar price on Amazon.](https://uguitars.com/p/b0cn9pywq7/)

**Feel and Playability**

In terms of handling, I've found this guitar incredibly comfortable to play. Its dreadnought body feels solid without being overly heavy (weighing approximately 10.45 pounds), and the smooth birch laminate neck sits comfortably in my hands for extended jamming sessions. The richlite fingerboard delivers a silky feel under the fingers, with no awkward snagging or rough frets that you sometimes get with budget guitars. Practicing fingerpicking patterns on this neck was such a joy that I actually lost track of time while experimenting with different songs.

**Wood Quality and Build Durability**

Even though the HPL might raise some eyebrows for players who swear by solid wood constructions, this material brings immense durability to the table. Touring musicians or those who habitually find themselves jamming outdoors will sincerely appreciate how resistant this guitar is to temperature and humidity fluctuations. Despite its sturdy build, it doesn’t compromise the warm tonal quality that's emblematic of traditional mahogany guitars.

**Key Benefits**

- Eye-catching mahogany finish with durable HPL construction.  
- Comfortable birch neck and richlite fingerboard for smooth playability.  
- Solid acoustic warmth, perfect for unplugged sessions or stage performances.  

**Performance and Sound Quality**

As an acoustic-electric hybrid, the Martin D-X1E proves to be quite versatile. Its unplugged sound has an impressive depth and full-bodied warmth, thanks to the classic Martin X-bracing design. Playing full chords or solo melodies gives you this resonant, rich sound that feels as satisfying as cooking a perfect meal from scratch. Once plugged in, the E-1 electronics shine by maintaining the organic tonal quality of the instrument. It’s got enough clarity and balance to cut through a band mix during live performances, but it’s also sensitive enough to capture nuances for recording purposes.

**Drawbacks and Concerns**

Like any product, though, it has its areas for improvement.  

- Some purists might prefer a solid-wood top over HPL.  
- Slightly heavier compared to other acoustic-only guitars, potentially less ideal for beginners.  
- Limited body cutout could restrict access to higher frets.  

**Other Options in the Market**

When compared to peers like the Taylor Academy 10E or Yamaha FGX800C, the Martin D-X1E stands tall with its build durability and premium look. However, Taylor models often get the upper hand in volume projection and balance, whereas Yamaha offers high playability at a lower cost. That said, those who prioritize the marriage of rugged practicality with a professional sound would likely lean toward this guitar.

**Bang for the Buck**

Considering its features and construction quality, this guitar puts forward a fantastic price-to-quality ratio. The durability and versatile sound it offers significantly widen its use cases, which makes the money spent feel more like a long-term investment. Players can genuinely perform everywhere from intimate coffee shop gigs to amplified sessions in larger venues with this one instrument.

1kk3hn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kk3hn2/workplace_trouble/,Workplace trouble,"Hi all. Happened to watching DarkFluff when I was reminded of this. Two things actually that happened at the same time. I don't remember what was said as my memory is crap when it comes to talking but actions I remember clearly.

To set the stage. This happened two years ago. I had recently left a decent job at a local hotel due to extreme pain in my back among other issues and got a job as a full time barista and Lotto operato at a well known supermarket chain only in New Zealand. When I got to the interview  I told the interviewer I would be seeing a doctor regularly and that things may change. They said it was fine and were willing to help if needed. 

Now I prided myself on making the best damn hot drinks and it really showed. I had happy regulars that would ask for me to make their drinks. Aside from being all smiles and talking to them, I didn't do anything special except keeping the bean grinder and coffee machine perfectly calibrated which is not hard to do and it stayed that way for about three months.

One day I come back from having 4 days off due my pain. ( I couldn't stand for more than 5 minutes and I could barely move) The coffee machine's calibration was so far off that it was just more water than coffee. I went to my department supervisor to complain as the person who took over was a ""better trained"" barista who made coffees at a fancy hotel. They didn't know what they were doing despite a detailed notebook that is kept up to date. The supervisor just brushed me off so I went back to calibrate the machines again. This took a lot of time as you cannot just simply put it back on the previous setting, the machines were very sensitive and I ended up going through about half a bag. (Roughly 16 to 18 shots of coffee worth $7 for every two shots) The owner saw what happened and despite my explanation, she banned me from calibrating the machines due to the wastage. This resulted in the machine quickly going back to the watered down coffee due to the other barista. 

This really pissed me off and my motivation was just gone as I loved making hot drinks and seeing the smiles on their faces. The effect was almost immediate, regulars stopped coming and the average of roughly 70 customers ordering coffees dropped down to 15 customers per day. The owner didn't care at all and made sure I was still banned from calibrating.

Now  unfortunately this is where my issues took a turn for the worst. I couldn't stand any longer around 4 hours into an 8 hour shift. I often went home early as a result and I was on strong pain medication that I took daily. After two weeks of this, the doctors finally diagnosed me with axial spondyloarthritis. They gave me a medical that let me have a chair  which I gave to the owner. All I needed was a simple chair that I could use when the pain got bad and only when no customers were around. The owner just straight up refused saying it was bad for appearances and that she would only accept it if I got worksafe people to inspect the area and provide a specialized chair. Keep in mind, a simple stool would have been perfect. 

Appointment times are 2 to 4 weeks away due to lack of doctors at my local hospital so a month had passed. During that time, I frequently called in sick. (admittedly some days were just lack of motivation due to the coffee situation. ) I would often be slouching over the lotto terminal when the pain was bad. Now the slouching part was a little bit on purpose because screw the owner for not accepting the medical certificate.

Finally appointment rolls around and guess what? The fricking owner of the store has to be the one to call worksafe. So i said screw it and asked the doctor to submit a medical capacity form which he happily did so and I took to the owner and quit on the spot. Owner was not happy at all as she didn't bother to make sure additional staff were trained to use the coffee machine and Lotto machine. It took three weeks before she could get both the lotto terminal and coffee area back up and running. Coffee is still pretty much more water than coffee

As for me. I have a better handle on my medical condition now and am back to working part time as a delivery driver. but I still wonder if AITAH here.

Sorry about the long read

Just about to pay when I hear, ""I got that"" from behind me. I turn around. It's the same guy. I say thanks and head out the door. 'Can't beat that.'

Couple minute walk to city bus stop. Gear down. Smoke. On bus. Twenty minutes later dropped a ten minute walk from the end of the pier. Duck into library bathroom to change into shorts and flip flops. It's mid eightes in central Florida. And, surprisingly, humid as fuck. 

Out of library. Around building. Down pier. Run right into my friend. We talk about moving my boat closer to the pier. I'm down, but neither of us have the stuff to do it. It will take a bit of work on my end. I'm cool with that but it's gonna take a few days of running to shore and working on a few things. On his end, his dinghy isn't in good enough shape to tow me. I'm still on the search for another dinghy. 

He's about to head out. We hop in his dinghy and head for my boat. 

I'm not setup for the boat. Very little food. One gallon of water. I was hoping to drop my gear in his dinghy and go to the store, but you take the ride when you can get it. I relay I'm not setup well and will need a ride in the morning. He acknowledges. 

We pull up on my boat. I get my gear up on deck. Climb aboard. We shoot the shit for a few. He heads for his boat. Keys dug out of backpack. Companionway door open hatch slid open. Down in the depths. 'Moldy.' Open hatches. Open port lights. Back out on deck. Lazarettes open. Check anchor ropes while letting boat air out. All is well.

Into boat. White distilled vinegar spray bottle in hand. Spray the inside of the boat from bow to stern. Air quality improves. Back out on deck 'cause you really shouldn't sit inside a boat that's been hosed down with vinegar. Hang for a bit. Smoke. Watch the water. Feel the boat move...

Gear into boat. Chargers out of pack and hooked up. Charge controller set for normal use. Fans on. Phone charging. Tunes playing. 'Time to catch a buzz and stretch out for the first time in five days.'

Between bouts of laying around like I'm part of the leisure class I check the bilge. 'Not full to the mast so pretty good.' I didn't check the other end. The boat's not sinking. Closing that thruhull must be doing the trick. Watch a movie. Eat the random food I brought with me and a large can of cling peaches that was on the boat. Pass out.

The plan was to hang for a week or so. Do some maintenance. Chill on the water.

Wake up this morning. Chillin'. Start thinking about stuff to do for the boat. I realize the boat is fine for a while. I can hang here and spend the money I've got on the boat, then bail. Or take this little bit of cash I've got and hitchhike out, making this run a bit more comfortable. 

And then this wall of depression hit me. It wasn't anything specific, but damn! You'd think somebody had died.

That was the decider. I get my gear packed. Text my friend. He calls. ""I'm headed to shore in a few. I'll swing by and come get you."" Gear on deck. Trash on deck. Boat secured for weather. 

Another friend of ours shows up. Someone gave him a boat. Gear in his dinghy. Me in dinghy. Off to the dock. Tie off. Gear out. Us out. I hang for a while and shoot the shit with him and my friend. Decide there's no reason to hang out, and head for the bus stop. Quick pit stop for a doughnut and some coffee.

Caught two busses to one of my camp spots. Grocery store, gas station, and some restaurants nearby. Tent up. Gear in tent. Head to grocery store. Take my time enjoying a/c for a while. Back out. To gas station. Smokes. Head for camp. 

Currently chilling in the tent with the rain fly off enjoying the breeze, some Fritos scoops and guacamole thrown in for good measure. Might break out 2001 for a movie in a bit...",17,1746976850.0,vagabond,1,1.0,False
1kk3g2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1kk3g2d/mothers_day_disappointment/,Mother’s Day disappointment,"My husband (M33) and I (F32) have been together for 12 years. Our first child is 7 and our second one is 2. Every year for Mother’s Day I always feel frustrated. I’m the planner of the family and I’m always coordinating our outings and stuff. I really love doing this but once a year it would be nice to not do it and to be asked what I feel like doing and someone else doing the planning for once. This never happens and I always get disappointed. This year’s Mother’s Day was especially tricky because my family is visiting for 2 weeks (I see them once or twice a year because they live in different countries). My dad is leaving this afternoon and we were invited to my nephew’s birthday today. My dad’s departure kind of overlapped with his birthday so we tried to do different plans but the easiest and most convenient was for me to stay with my family at home, and him taking the kids alone (since it’s his sister’s son’s birthday). Note: we like about 1.5 hour from where the party is, but it also happens to be close to the airport. And then at the end of the party I would meet them so he could give me the kids and he can say goodbye to my dad. And then I would take them. Well I don’t know if he was mad at me because of that but today he was especially not in a good mood. He went to McDonald’s for breakfast, didn’t ask me if that’s what I wanted, didn’t even take out the freaking sandwich for me he just left it in the kitchen because he was mad I told him my mom asked me to take her to church. I just went to drop her off and he insisted he didn’t need to bring me the sandwich. I was hurt so I left the table without eating to wrap my nephew’s birthday presents then he came and he said I was overreacting. He left a card for me to find on my desk!?? Wtf he knows I go to the gym in the morning??? It had a Sephora gift card. I had already asked him if he could give me one of those clickers for my Kobo. And he said I was being spoiled. I was just mad because I didn’t get that clicker thing. He wouldn’t even know where to get it??? Like no???? I’m mad because you didn’t even remind the kids it was Mother’s Day, they didn’t come to greet me in the morning, I told you what I wanted and you decided to ignore me, you’re not being understanding thinking I would have a hard day because I have to say goodbye to my dad and I won’t see him again until hopefully next year. Then he started getting mad and saying he won’t take the kids to their cousin’s birthday. Which wtf why would you do that?? All of this to say, I’m hurt. Other than “special occasions”, my husband is wonderful and is always there for us. He does small gestures like bringing me coffee and chocolates when I’m sad or mad but why can’t he try a little harder on these occasions without me pushing him???

1kk3cvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTheorists/comments/1kk3cvb/finally_finished_my_own_subnautica_theories_and/,Finally finished my own Subnautica theories and Timeline since the GT video alone wasn't enough,"A few years ago, Game Theory released a video on *Subnautica*. Since it's one of my favorite game universes—and one of the first games I ever played—I was really excited to watch it. While the video was interesting and had a beautiful core message, I was a bit disappointed. The main theory was simply that planet 4546B would be destroyed. It didn’t really address the questions I had about the game.

That said, the theory seems somewhat confirmed: Paul Torgal from the Degasi didn’t care much about the planet itself, only about the resources he could extract from it—a recurring theme in *Subnautica*. (Source: Paul Torgal’s Log #2 – “Dilemma.”)

With one new game already out and another on the way this year, I ended up writing a full Subnautica timeline myself, along with a few theories. I hope some people find it interesting—and that I didn’t ruffle any feathers with the start or title. I’d love to hear your thoughts!

A long time ago, though definitely longer than 1,708 years (as one of the aliens present on 4546b is that old, according to alien biological history), the aliens known as the Precursors started their existence. Much later, they began to expand to other worlds (Kharra contagion profile) and later learned how to upload and store their minds as data, as well as bioengineer new bodies out of multiple other species (alien biological history).

\--> (The body engineering comes after the expansion because that's how it is for humans in Subnautica).

At some point during their expansion, they discovered the bacterium Kharaa on a different world.

This bacterium killed 143 billion people on their core worlds and led to a lockdown (Kharra contagion profile).

Following this lockdown was the plan to create a cure for Kharaa. While it wasn’t harmful to them (as they could just create new bodies), it was harmful to every species their bodies were bioengineered from, as Kharaa could evolve to hurt those species (dialogue: Scan two body components).

The plan involved going to isolated worlds and building research facilities to find a cure (Kharra contagion profile).

Either before, during, or after that, the Precursors discovered Earth, possibly between 1,875 - 900 BCE (the PDA entry ""Alien Statue"" hints at a connection between the alien statue and Centaurs from Earth) or the Alien Carving (which resembles the Yin Yang symbol, which on Earth can be traced back to the Yin Yang Jia of 304 - 240 BCE) or at least the 13th century (ancient Earth blade). More on that later.

As we found out, one of those missions happened on 4546B (because the destroyed alien base in SN1 is literally named the Disease Research Facility, just like the Disease Research Facility mentioned in the Kharra contagion profile). These research facilities stored pure Kharaa samples and used them on specimens.

The leading scientist was, as we found out, AL-AN, the guy from BZ (dialogue: Build the first component).

After the aliens found and captured the Sea Emperor, a Leviathan excreting an enzyme that could lay Kharaa dormant, they observed how the Peepers (fish able to propel itself using water jets), used the vents   to swim up to the Emperor, puke out what it ate, then proceeded to eat the enzyme and swim up to different parts of the crater while ejecting the enzyme, slowing down the progress and losing any kind of survival instinct.

(Peepers Entering the Containment Facility, Peepers Entering the Containment Facility, Enzyme Host Peepers Leaving the Containment Facility, Enzyme Host Peeper).

They began experimenting on the Sea Emperor and discovered it could no longer produce Enzyme 42 effectively. Hoping to heal the planet, the Precursors turned to its eggs, trying to force them to hatch. However, the Sea Emperor was angered by its treatment and refused to reveal which enzymes were needed—likely both out of defiance and because the Precursors had killed one of its young. (Approaching the Alien Arch covered in sand, Approaching the Incubator device, environmental story telling)

They also found out that the Sea Dragon Leviathan could produce a similar enzyme.

So AL-AN went against his directive, stealing a Sea Dragon egg and incubated it, which led to the Sea Dragon's mother destroying the Disease Research Facility. Although it was true that the young could indeed create an enzyme, the disease contained in that facility went rampant and infected 4546B 1,000 years before SN1 (Fossil Data PDA entry).

The planet was then shut down.

During the shutdown, bigger Leviathans either built up immunity due to biomagnification (as Peepers are at the end of the food chain) or were already immune (Reaper being immune, Leviathans not being able to get infected in SN1, Sea Dragon being immune).

Word needed: Transgov:

Trans-gov - An independent authority in de facto control of at least one solar system and phasegate.

Warning: The following may be changed in the future because it was already removed from the game.

Now, let's jump to the 21st century, where something like a great war happened because it's stated that at the point of traveling to new planets, Earth's territories were part of a singular Transgov: Sol (entry was retconned but it fits).

Then, phase gates were invented, and Sol started their expansion.

However, fairly quickly, those colonies wanted independence, and Sol lost their territory to the newly forming Transgovs (Trans-Gov History: Sol).

The Transgov then started fighting in the so-called Great Expansion.

In the mid-22nd century, the defense manufacturer Alterra was formed, which supplied Sol but then later also parted from Sol and began supplying everyone else, which ultimately led to Sol's already crumbled dominance (canon).

Alterra then grew and became so large that when they said they would stop every supply, it ended the Great Expansion.

Every big Transgov then sat at a table and signed ""The Charter,"" a legal contract agreed upon by 37 Transgovs that stopped the Great Expansion.

In order to enforce ""The Charter,"" ""The TSF,"" a military police force charged with enforcing the terms of the Charter, independent of, but funded by, the Trans-govs, most importantly Alterra, was formed. (Trans-Gov Profile: Alterra Corp.)

By the way, Sol ended up being so small that they had to accept their position and terraformed planets and used different alien lifeforms to even give life to lifeless planets. Growth was sidelined in favor of balance and efficient use of space and resources. The flattest social structures in the Federation, with no internal currency, high self-sufficiency, and high citizen satisfaction.

Anyways, after the war, China's hard-to-reach outer space worlds were no longer valuable, so they were left to starve. --> They declared independence and claimed their infrastructure. They are a minor Transgov but expand quickly (because they are at the outskirts and built into every direction, even towards the Ariadne Arm).

Also, during that time, the Mongolian mining corporation Torgal was created.

Some time later, the Mongolian mining company Torgal, as well as the Mongolian Transgov, started a cabal to build phase gates to the Ariadne Arm.

In this relationship, the statically more important Torgal Mining Corporation was supposed to bring the needed resources for the project, and a few years into the project, they already had mines and space stations in the region. (Trans-Gov Profile: Mongolian Independent States).

But where is that region?

The game only tells us a few locations altogether:

The first thing that mentions it is the designation of the planet we play on, ""4546B,"" meaning we are in solar system 4546, on the second discovered planet. It's also mentioned that 4546B is located in the Ariadne Arm.

\--> So, if we go by normal rules of naming celestial bodies (like Kepler-2 being named that way because the solar system is named Kepler and the planet is the second one discovered), we can say 4546B is part of the Ariadne Arm of an unnamed galaxy and that it was the second discovered planet of the solar system. Easy, right? Well, not so much, because we still don't know the most important part: the galaxy.

So, according to every piece of information so far, the game could either take place in:

A) The Milky Way that wasn't completely discovered yet,

B) The Andromeda Galaxy (that was already discovered according to the Sunbeam),

or even

C) A new galaxy?

Let's first rule out the Andromeda Galaxy.

Because even though it is the only other galaxy named, it's rather unlikely, as the person dropping the name is saying:

""This is Sunbeam. Y'know, Aurora, we're from a little Trans-gov on the far side of Andromeda, and we have a saying there.""

Thereby not telling you specifically where he is from but just telling you a rough location.

It wouldn’t make much sense for him to introduce himself just with ""from Andromeda"" if we were in the Andromeda Galaxy. That's like meeting someone in the US and asking where they are from, and they say, ""I'm from the US."" Like, yeah, no shit, but where specifically? Him telling you that they are from the Andromeda Galaxy implies that we are not in fact in the Andromeda Galaxy, because if we were, that information would be completely useless.

That leaves Option A and C.

(Alterra launches the Aurora)

The ultimate answer to the question is told to us by the Aurora mission orders as well:

""PHASEGATE ANNOUNCED FOR THE ARIADNE ARM: ALTERRA LAUNCHES THE AURORA

The furthest reaches of inhabited space are due to expand, as Alterra Corp launches a newly-constructed capital ship, carrying a phasegate bound for the Ariadne Arm.""

""Furthest reaches"" is talking about the Ariadne Arm here, meaning the Galaxy arm itself is ""newly discovered"" (as in has no phasegate connection). And as it would be unlikely that it is a newly discovered unconnected part of the Milky Way (because humans already discovered Andromeda), it would be most likely that they at least discovered or connected every galaxy arm in the Milky Way.

So, the only answer left would be a new galaxy.

This is also supported by the Mongolian Transgov, the first Transgov who started the expansion into the Ariadne Arm, being an outer galaxy Transgov, because naturally, an outer galaxy Transgov would have the shortest way to the Ariadne Arm if the Ariadne Arm were part of a new galaxy.

Meaning we are in a newly discovered galaxy in solar system 4546 on the second discovered planet.

The Mongolian Transgov, with the Torgal company, has plans to expand their territory by building a phase gate in the nearest solar system of a new galaxy. This would give them a lot of money, since they not only would own the trade routes, but their partner corporation would also own mines and infrastructure near the phase gate, which would make further expansion easier. This is a threat to Alterra, as the Mongolian Transgov could monopolize a whole galaxy and every trade route to that galaxy, rivaling Alterra's current phase gate ownership of 9%.

(/Alterra Auxiliary orders)

During the time of the expansion of the Ariadne Arm (but before the building of a phase gate), 4546b claimed its first ship, the Mercury II. This Sol Transgov ship made its way across 4546 until the captain decided to land on the planet upon discovery of alien structures, under the excuse of fixing their broken thrusters (Trusting My Instincts - Diana, Thruster Damage - Stefanos). The ship was then shot, but in the last minutes, the captain dumped reactor water and flares so the heat-attracted beam didn’t hit the ship. They then landed on 4546 and started repairs.

While discovering the planet, part of the crew gets attacked by iceworms, while a portion gets sick, so an emergency takeoff is initiated. Upon the emergency takeoff, the ship was again attacked by the gun, and so it crashed, making it the first victim of greed on 4546b, or the second if you count Allan experimenting with the Sea Dragon.

At the same time, the cabal of the Mongolian Transgov further advances, still being a threat to Alterra.

Luckily for Alterra, the CEO of Torgal is a mumbling idiot.

The Degasi Crash:

Roughly 10+ years before Subnautica takes place, the Degasi, with Paul as well as Bart Torgal alongside security personnel such as Marguerite Maida, are on their way to a new deep space station so Bart Torgal could serve 5 years as COO of the station. On the way to the station, they passed 4546, scanned the surface, and performed a maneuver to land on the planet because, as it turns out, it is rich in minerals. They then, of course, get shot down by the space laser.

(Paul Torgal's Log #2 - Dilemma, Degasi Voice Log #3 - Aftermath).

They crash-land, the crew aside from the Torgal family and Marguerite dies, and they make their way to the floating islands. There, they start to starve because they don’t have enough grow beds, and Marguerite makes the proposal to go underwater.

(Degasi Voice Log #2 - Storm!, Degasi Voice Log #2 - Storm!, Degasi Voice Log #3 - Aftermath).

Then a storm hits, and the grow beds and the base are destroyed, forcing them to make their way underwater to the mushroom cave.

(Degasi Voice Log #1 - Habitation Location, Degasi Voice Log #3 - Aftermath, Degasi Voice Log #2 - Storm!).

There, they discover that they are, in fact, ill and that they were shot down by something, and the only answer to shutting it down is going deeper.

(Degasi Voice Log #6 - Deeper?!, Degasi Voice Log #6 - Malady).

In the second underwater habitat, Marguerite kills a Reaper, goes to the habitat, and gets in a fight with Paul, as Paul suspects that the corpse may attract another Reaper. Bart then leaves because the fight is too loud, and next, a Reaper attacks the base.

(Degasi Voice Log #8 - Risk Taking, Degasi Voice Log #9 - Disaster).

Marguerite protects Paul by stabbing the Reaper with a piece of scrap metal, but Paul dies anyway because of oxygen loss.

(Paul Torgal's Log #3 - The End).

Bart makes his way out and saves himself to the floating island, where he gets visions from either Kharaa or the Sea Emperor and then dies of the illness.

(Bart Torgal's Log #3 - Return From the Deep).

Marguerite, however, survives.

It was confirmed that it was a Reaper in the Marguerite Maida PDA entry.

Marguerite then makes her way to Sector Zero.

Marguerit Maida's Log #1: After she attacked the Reaper and was dragged down, she kept stabbing it, but the Reaper kept swimming to the crater's edge and then into the void. She then killed the Reaper and swam up, only to realize she is in the void.

Marguerit Maida's Log #2: The Reaper then floated to the surface after a few hours, and because she couldn’t reach the shore, she saved herself onto the Reaper. She, over the course of her travel, cut herself into the Reaper and burned its fat while eating it, and unlike Bart, didn’t die to Kharaa. This confirms my theory that the Reaper’s stomach enzymes have a similar effect as the Sea Emperor's, as she lived and slept inside the Reaper and only ate the Reaper while surviving Kharaa.

Marguerit Maida's Log #3: After some time, the Reaper began to rot, and after some more time, the temperature dropped, leading to the Reaper meat freezing and sinking. She eventually reached Sector Zero and left the Reaper. She also says it took her 3 weeks for the journey.

After the loss of the Torgal heads, the cabal of the Mongolian Corp is stopped.

Then, for ten years, the Degasi still isn't found in the sector, so the Mongolian Transgov asks Alterra to find the Torgal heads, and Alterra agrees under the condition of building and owning the phase gate in 4546.

(Aurora Auxiliary missions), which is the reason for the Mongolian representative being on board of the Aurora.

Approximately 16 months before the game, the Aurora is launched.

Why? Because the PDA says the Aurora needs 3 months from the most outer Alterra space docks to fly through multiple different Transgovs to the nearest phase gate and then takes 18 months to arrive at the building site. HOWEVER, the Auxiliary missions state that the Aurora will perform the slingshot maneuver the Degasi did to scan where it is on 4546b at around 13 months after they left the last phase gate.

(Alterra Launches the Aurora).

During the Aurora’s maneuver, the laser shoots the Aurora. The captain isn’t as smart as the Sunbeam captain, and the Aurora crashes, but when?

Well, the only real date we have is the sword that says it’s from the 13th century and the soil scans telling us the outbreak was 1000 years before we arrived, though that only narrows it down to after the 24th century. However, we can narrow it down further. Let's just look at the blade.

After looking up what blade that is, we can assume it’s a Mongolian dao (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dao\_(Chinese\_sword)), because the wiki article says the following about the Mongolian dao: ""With the Mongol invasion of China in the early 13th century and the formation of the Yuan dynasty (1271 - 1368), the curved steppe saber became a greater influence on Chinese sword designs. \[...\] It was a favored weapon among the Mongol aristocracy. Its effectiveness for mounted warfare and popularity among soldiers throughout the Mongol empire had lasting effects."" (Wiki article)

And because the sword from the PDA is also curved, is also from around the Yuan dynasty (dated back to the 13th century), and has horse ornamentation pointing to the weapon being used by Mongolian riding soldiers, we can, as I said, assume it to be a Mongolian dao.

The PDA also says the sword has blood from seven separate heads of state on it. We can narrow it down to be stemming from the Mongolian invasion of China (1205–1279, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol\_conquest\_of\_China). Meaning the earliest the sword could have arrived on 4546B would be around 1205, and the latest could be 1279, which is the end of the conquest and thereby the last point in time where Mongols could have killed a head of state in China.

Though, in my opinion, the most logical time in which the Mongols could have killed 7 heads of state during the conquest of China close together must be 1227 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol\_conquest\_of\_Western\_Xia), which is the ending year of the conquest of Western Xia, during which they notably killed 4 heads of state, but there could also be heads of state of the Jin dynasty killed during that time (a dynasty connected to Western Xia), which could bring the number up to seven heads of state if you assume that the sword wasn’t cleaned properly or that the scanner might have just found small blood samples.

We can also assume that the PDA could have just found faint blood samples, which makes my assumption of 1227 just as possible as any other time when 7 heads of state were killed, though I would say the sword wasn’t taken until after 1205, which is the start of the invasion, as during the start itself, it is very unlikely that 7 heads were killed.

The time of the sword’s arrival on 4546B should thereby be: after 1205, around 1227 to around 1279, and because we can’t just assume that the sword wasn’t brought to the planet and 2 seconds after the outbreak happened, we can only say that the outbreak happened between 1227 and 1279.

And if we now add 1000 years on it, we can safely say that the Aurora crashed definitely after between 2227 and 2279, ultimately defeating the assumption of the game taking place during the mid-23rd century because no one ever said this.

No, for real, the only thing saying it takes place during the mid-23rd century was a scene from Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero, but both were cut out, meaning we can’t take that as a source. And I know I took the Sol Transgov entry as a source, that’s also cut, but this doesn’t affect the story as much.

The problem is that everyone assumes it’s the 23rd century, even though it could just as likely be the 24th or 26th century, because the only information we really do have is after the 23rd century, and with my information, specifically after between 2227 and 2279, and the devs never stated anything else about when it took place either.

Let’s continue with the story.

From here on out, we can go with voice logs of the different lifeboats, those lifepods relevant to the story:

Upon the crash, the captain gives the crew responsibility to Officer Keen (Lifepod 19, Second Officer Keen's Voicelog), after which Keen gives instructions to disregard safety protocol and swim to the rendezvous point on the floating islands.

After the crash, CTO Yu is trapped under the ocean craft's stuff and then evacuates the lifepod (Lifepod 2, Chief Technical Officer Yu's Voicelog - T+2min).

Yu, CTO, and Keen meet at the rendezvous point, which seems to be the floating islands.

Yu, CTO, wants to go to Aurora to fix long-range communications. Keen goes along with the plan. (Rendezvous Voicelog).

8 hrs after the crash, Aurora sends the blueprints, which should be shortly before Yu and Keen try to travel to Aurora (Alterra HQ - Last Recorded Transmissions).

The CTO and Keen don’t make it to the ship because of a Leviathan, but notice that there is a blueprint sent to the captain's quarters. (Rendezvous Voicelog).

Another weird and neat detail is that the Lifepod 12 Medical Officer Danby’s Crew Log says that Danby has pustules growing on his skin, which is weird since the incubation time recorded by the PDA is 2 weeks (Bacterial infectio[n report).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period).This)

[The definition of incubation period clear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period).This)ly states that incubation is the time elapsed between exposure to a pathogenic organism, a chemical, or radiation, and when symptoms and signs are first apparent (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation\_period).

This means that either Danby is extremely weak to the disease or he stayed on 4546b for 2 weeks while we were there as well.

But, to be honest, I don't really think we were on 4546b for 2 weeks before the symptoms appeared either, so either Kharaa instantly transformed as soon as we retracted the disease (which is very much possible; I mean, it is stated ""Bacterial Mechanisms: Attaches to healthy living cells and mutates the basic genetic structure."")

Anyways...

8 hours after the crash, the Aurora records one life sign: that of ""Non-Essential Systems Maintenance Chief Ryley Robinson"" (us), and to be honest, it's good to know we were the chief of something, even though our job most likely was repairing coffee machines.

Would also explain that we are so good with technology because I assume in the sci-fi world, the school system would still be so bad that a Non-Essential Systems Maintenance worker still has to learn the same stuff a ""System Maintenance Officer"" would have to learn.

(Aurora Black Box Data)

By the way, the death of Yu and Keen, the sending of data to the Aurora, and our awakening all happened 8 hours after the crash.

\--> Ryley then does what we do in the game and leaves the planet. We don't know when.

After we cured the planet, we land on the nearest space station and are told that our debt is rather large.

And the game is over.

We do have information on what happened while we were crashed.

First, communication was lost, but Alterra assures that this can be normal (Alterra Misplaces 1km Capital Ship Aurora).

Second, Alterra says the Aurora crashed and that there are survivors, so they sent blueprints (Aurora Wreckage Located, Survivors Confirmed).

Third, the press notices that the readings of the Aurora crash show the same energy burst seen when the Degasi crashed (Was Unexplained Ion Signature Linked to the Aurora's Disappearance?).

We also have cut content telling us how Alterra wants to go back and salvage the parts for the phase gate in order to build a phase gate, but as said, we can't assume it as true.

Now that we've returned, we can assume that Ryley fed all his information about 4546b to Alterra because his PDA is still owned by Alterra.

We can also assume that Alterra returned before the pre-Below Zero events because:

The Aurora wreck still has Alterra technology on it.

We see the Seatruck teleportation module in Below Zero, which must've been invented before Below Zero (duh), and its PDA description says, ""Harnessing the power generated by ion cubes, the teleportation module creates an interminable link between a tether tool and itself"" (Seatruck Teleportation Module). The tether tool is shaped to carry an ion cube and has green teleportation effects.

Also: ""How the ion cube facilitates the rapid disassembly and reassembly of organic material in a target location is still the subject of great debate in the scientific community,"" meaning 1) the standard needed for teleportation is the ion cube, and 2) in order to use ion cubes, they have to be back on 4546b since the ion cubes were created in the crater.

Wording shows they were back: ""Rare specimens like these provide our only live source,"" meaning they found more than one Leviathan with pustules on 4546b (Frozen Leviathan).

They know about the sanctuaries, which is only possible if they went back to the crater: Architect Research Notes.

""Meeting w Zeta"" mentions the Kharaa outbreak, which is only known to Ryley.

Marguerite's official PDA entry says: Marguerite Maida. According to the PDA, it was found out that she reportedly killed a Reaper Leviathan and then got lost.

\--> Alterra 100% knows about Ryley's data.

\--> It was a Reaper, information only known to Ryley.

It also makes a lot of sense for Alterra to return because it is very rich in resources and mining it is profitable.

This, by the way, shows GT's theory is definitely correct, but Subnautica didn't try to say otherwise in the first place. I mean, Torgal literally says ""\[...\] There's enough lithium there to fabricate a hundred tons of plasteel. \[...\] If we get off this planet, they'll be talking about the Torgal share price on the other side of the Federation. \[...\]""

Anyways, we can also safely assume that Alterra either really did salvage and build the phase gate or build infrastructure or build a phase gate in general because it is clear that Alterra has authority over the region.

Let's move on to the events before 4546b.

Before Below Zero:

""Sector Zero is comprised of 2 square kilometers of ocean, bordered by mountainous terrain to the north and west. This region of the planet is covered in snow and ice, left in a mostly permanent winter. Extreme weather events make for spectacular sky displays at all hours. For unknown reasons, it was selected by Architects as a hub for their installations. Life in the area has flourished since the release of enzyme 42 into the larger ecosystem.""

Guide: Research Station Zero.

This is the introduction to Sector Zero and the Frost Pack, a research operation of Alterra into everything from robotics to mining to biology.

During her time on Sector Zero, Samantha Ayou, the sister of Robin Ayou, invents the Spy Pengling.

Then, during a delivery, Fred discovers a Frozen Leviathan (Below Zero trailer).

Fred tells this to Sam as well as that the site is sealed off.

Sam then gives Fred a Spy Pengling in order for him to take it to the Leviathan to take photos.

(Recorded Conversation - Samantha Ayou and Fred Lachance).

Sam takes those photos and shows them to a colleague who says she will escalate the situation (Meeting w Zeta).

Sam also talks to a colleague who draws art of the bacterium, which looks different, and there she finds out that Alterra works on mutations (Vinh's art).

She confronts her girlfriend about it, and her girlfriend tells her that she indeed is correct, and there is work being done on Kharaa (Dani call re: research).

Upon telling everyone else, she is banished to Outpost Zero, a place where every researcher that does something wrong is told to go and made to do meaningless tasks.

(Counting down the days!).

At some point, Sam found Marguerite and talked with her about the Kharaa project needing to be destroyed.

Sam then says she will take care of the Lev and blow up the cave entrance.

\--> How she and Parvan died.

Sam also tells Marguerite about the bacterium research lab, and Marguerite says she will take care of that.

\--> Marguerite destroys the Omega lab, and Sam the Lev site.

(Just A Couple of Friends, Talking).

Sam also creates an antibacterial agent, which is very possible since it's not the same as a cure but generally just a fancy word for disinfectant (No Turning Back).

Sam doesn't get to use it as she is seen in the cave by Parvan, so she blows up the entry, killing her and Parvan.

(Parvan: Hello, is someone there?).

SN Below Zero then plays out. We use the antibacterial agent on the Leviathan and leave.

HOWEVER, THIS DOESN'T ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.

Because it's Alterra, we can be sure that they definitely had backups of their data and the bacterium, even more so because Alterra still had access to the frozen Leviathan samples before we arrived since Sam didn't use the agent on the frozen Leviathan.

And we know that because of the following quote from the Architects:

""Bacterial Mechanisms: Attaches to healthy living cells and mutates the basic genetic structure.""

Kharaa Contagion Profile.

Meaning Kharaa can evolve the host's genetic structure, and we know Alterra works to control just that based on:

Report - Enzyme Mutation Study.

""We were able to stimulate rapid multiplication of cells in a controlled environment, resulting in the creation of several different mutations with potentially useful applications.

Think of the possibilities-- life-saving treatments, genetic research-- it could be a window to understand the evolution of life on this planet. The findings could move us forward by years!""

And just what are we able to do in SN2?

""Study Mysterious Lifeforms.

Uncover a rich world full of mysterious lifeforms, from the smallest fish to the largest Leviathans. Scan creatures to learn more about them. Use your biosampler to take samples for study. As you learn more about this world, evolve your genetics to adapt your body for survival.""

So that means neither Sam nor Robin accomplished anything, and Alterra finished their work.

Also, here we can beautifully tie in with Natural Selection 2, which plays in the same universe as Subnautica (based on us fighting against mutated Kharaa hosts and the Alterra corporation being a thing in this game), meaning somewhere after SN2, Kharaa spreads again. However, it's now a mutated form that mutates everything it comes in contact with.",1,1746976560.0,GameTheorists,1,1.0,False

He sips at a cup of coffee as he sets his supplies out, the bitter drink fighting away the fatigue. He had asked for help to lay out tables a short way away from the Medic cabin, and at each table, he set a packed First Aid kit.

A few days prior, he had set out a notice for the lesson that read;

> Learn Basic First Aid outside the Medic cabin.
> 
> This is a necessary skill in war, and whether you learn or not may mean the difference between life and death. Come if you wish.
> 
> \- Hosted by Jem English, Hebe Counsellor

Whether or not campers would show up is up in the air, but Jem is here for those who want to learn. He would not force a lesson on those who simply wished not to think of the horrors they experienced thanks to Atlas.

* * *

By the time the first campers arrive, Jem is finished with his coffee and prepared. To be entirely honest, Jem is disappointed. There is a severe lack of general safety training among the demigods at camp. He understands the desire to fight, to protect camp, but to do so without preparing is foolish. The inexperience he has seen thus far may be justified, but it would not be going forward. Atlas's first strike came early and unexpected, but the next will be expected. Better if the camp is prepared for any scenario.

And so, as the seats fill, Jem starts to speak.

""If you are here, you want to learn. First Aid is something that everyone should know, whether they want to work in the Medic cabin or not. Knowledge of how to close a wound, to set a broken leg, or to disinfect an injury can draw the line between life with a limb and life without for you or one of your friends.""

Jem pauses to open his First Aid kit. ""I want you all to open your kits and look inside. There should be gauze, compression dressings, adhesive bandages, disinfectant wipes, medical cloth tape, a flask of nectar, and a small packet of ambrosia. If any of these are missing, let me know and I will come around with more.""

""There are four stations set up, one on each table. The **first** has detailed instructions on how to disinfect and dress a wound. The **second** has instructions on how to set a broken leg. The **third** is dedicated to identifying whether a wound needs stitches. The **fourth** is focused on determining when to and when not to drink nectar or eat ambrosia.""

""You can try this on yourselves or work in pairs, but practice now will prepare you for when you have to use this in a real, serious situation."" Jem emphasizes, unwrapping his arm and rolling the compression dressing up again to place it back in the kit.

""If you have any questions, I am here, or feel free to ask any medics present if that is easier. Once you feel you have learned enough in terms of making use of the supplies inside the kit, take it with you. You will likely need it."" Jem concludes, tone serious and voice tight.

* * *

**Station 1**

Start by setting out compression dressings and disinfectant wipes.

*   Clean the wound and the area around it with the disinfectant wipe.
    
*   Allow the wound and area around it to air dry (If not possible due to time constraints or threats nearby, this step can be skipped, or a _clean_ rag can be used to dry).
    
*   Wrap the compression dressing around the wounded area, allowing for half the dressing to overlap the previous layer with each round (Ensure the dressing isn't tight enough to cut off blood flow).
    
*   Cut free the end of the dressing and secure it with adhesive cloth tape.
    

Work on yourself or a partner, but practice by wrapping your 'injury' and securing it.

* * *

**Station 2**

Start by setting out the gauze and the wooden stick that has been provided.

*   Make sure the limb that was injured is kept in the position it was found in.
    
*   Place the wooden stick or something rigid against the limb to hold it in position.
    
*   Make sure the splint extends well beyond the injury.
    
*   Secure the splint to the limb with either cloth or gauze.
    
*   Check the limb for numbness and loosen the splint if necessary.
    

Work on yourself or a partner, but practice putting together a splint and test its effectiveness in limiting the mobility of your 'injury'.

* * *

**Station 3**

Observe the illustrations of injuries provided in the form of a notebook.

*   If the injury is located on the face, hands, or joints, it is likely that the injury will need stitches.
    
*   If the wound stays open and doesn't close easily, it will need stiches to heal.
    
*   If the wound is deeper than a quarter inch, it will need stitches to heal well.
    
*   Once stitched, a wound must be checked. If a medic isn't around, look for redness, swelling, warmth, pus, and fever as signs of infection.
    

Please practice by considering what kinds of wounds need stitches. Feel free to discuss amongs yourselves.

* * *

**Station 4**

Some example scenarios where ambrosia and nectar **_are_** needed are listed below.

*   If you have deep cuts and need to prevent blood loss.
    
*   If your shoulder was dislocated and you set it, but the pain remains.
    
*   If a limb is broken, but it has been aligned and splinted.
    

Some examples of when **not** to use nectar or ambrosia are listed next.

*   If you have a broken arm but it hasn't been set (It will heal crooked if amrosia or nectar is applied).
    
*   If your shoulder is dislocated but has not been set yet.
    

Please add any examples for each section that you can think of.

Whenever I make one of those cups or try them ay the coffee shop, they are always amazing. I can taste all the fruitiness and difference notes. Cero bitterness or acidity. Very enjoyable. 

But when I take the beans home and try to make them with my K6, I feel like my coffee tastes terrible. Sometimes too sour sometimes too bitter. Can almost never taste all the notes and fruitiness of the beans. I say it might be first world problem because in hindsight coffee still tastes good but I just want to taste those notes and fruity flavors so badly, I can’t. 

Is this a skill issue or a grinder issue?",1,1746975909.0,pourover,5,0.67,False
1kk33sx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kk33sx,AVOID THIS SUPPLIER: Wanderlast Flower Wrap | Sophia Llarenas,"Lengthy post.

So I had my wedding last April and I engaged this supplier as a reception stylist. Initially, 30k ang agreement namin for the styling ng tables and surrounding areas. Basically, ang focus ng styling was the tablescape talaga kasi sa beach eh. Nung pinakita ko sakanya yung inspo, nag agree naman siya at siya ang nag set ng presyo at 30k. 

Around January, nag meet kami and I decided na sakanya na rin kumuha ng coffee bar and flowers for church and entourage para hindi naman siya lugi, considering na from Manila siya at yung wedding was in Quezon. By January 20, nag pa downpayment siya ng another 15k for the styling and for the coffee bar. Sinabi niya rin na she will send the contract on that day, pero wala. Then come the end of February, she asked again to make a partial payment of 15k para daw makabili sila ng additional vases and candles. I paid her. I was also still waiting for the contract, pero wala pa rin. 

Around end of March, together with my coordinator, nag meeting kami via Zoom to finalize things. After that meeting, nag chat siya via FB Messenger na baka mag increase talaga yung price ng styling for the tablescape. In her exact words ""***Parang nasa atleast 80k all in na po siya kasi nasa 45k po yung styling na. Pinag uusapan pa po namin update po namin kayo today. Talagang up for 80k talaga siya mam.""*** So I clarified with her if tama yung breakdown ko, which she confirmed na tama: 

* **30k -- initial reception venue styling (increased to 40k)**
* 10k -- coffee bar 
* 30k -- flower entourage and church arrangement

By April 3, sabi niya mag sesend siya ng contract. She gave me via chat the final breakdown ng services niya + the pictures of the contract: 

* **60k -- reception styling**
* 30k -- flower entourage and church arrangement
* 15k -- coffee bar for 150 pax

Nagulat ako kasi nag-increase na naman yung sa reception styling, this time, **from 45k to 60k** naman. In her defense, yung 80k daw na sinasabi niya na all-in was for the church and styling and nag compute daw sila per table sa gagamitin na materials, 800 led lights and moving candles na daw since 100 per table ang gagamitin. Nag adjust din daw siya sa size ng led candle na gagamitin kasi gusto niya maganda yung set-up kasi hindi daw mag ccomplement sa BIG VASES yung maliliit na led candles.

Nag online meeting kami a few days after para i-discuss yung contract na sinend niya. Sobrang red flag na pero wala na akong choice but to trust her kasi April na. I tried haggling the price kasi nag double from the original price, pero she insisted na fixed na yon. Syempre since malapit na, nag go na rin ako. 

Gusto niya rin na mag full payment na ako a week before para daw makapag prepare sila ng materials. Puro assurances pa siya na wag mag worry, na I can vouch them naman daw. Na she wants to be paid in full lang talaga kasi na trauma daw sila from their last event sa S Maison kasi hindi sila binayaran. As per her message, ""*Sad to say kaya we always have the contract na masunod.""* By April 20, nag follow-up ulit siya for the payment, nag bayad ako ng 30k and sabi ko na yung remaining 20k on the day of the event ko na babayaran for security purposes. All in all, ang naging presyo ng services niya hit 105k. And it was almost paid by 80% bago pa dumating ang kasal. 

Come wedding day, ito na nga, ito na yung mga napansin ko: 

1. First, palanta na yung bouquet ko. Pag dating ko sa simbahan, bago pa ako mag lakad, lupaypay na yung ibang rose. 
2. Second, while on the way sa simbahan, pinakita sa akin nung bride attendant yung itsura nung church flowers. Disappointed na naman ako kasi iba yung picture sa usapan namin. Pero sabi na hindi pa raw nakakapag set-up yung stylist so medyo nakampante ako kasi baka yung mga set-up na nasa picture na pinakita sakin is yung set-up pa yata nung previous na kasal. 
3. Third, habang nag aantay ako sa labas ng simbahan, sumilip ako sa awang ng pinto. Nakita ko na may flower arch. Malinaw na malinaw sa usapan namin na ayoko ng flower arch. Pero wala hinayaan ko na kasi andon na eh. Nung nag lakad na ako, napansin ko na yung mga bulaklak iba iba, hindi nag ccomplement sa isat isa. In short, pangit. 
4. Fourth, may cloth sa gilid ng aisle pero halos sampung seat lang meron. 
5. Fifth, sa 2 sintra board na usapan, isa lang ang andon -- yung picture namin na akala mo anemic dahil walang kakulay kulay.  Walang welcome signage and wala rin yung selfie mirror na sinasabi niya. 
6. Sixth, wala yung 2 rattan basket na supposedly lalagyan ng mga fans. 
7. Seventh, wala rin set-up/styling of any sort yung yung registration table.
8. Eight, pag-pasok ko ng beach area (reception) yung tablescape na supposedly worth 60k, sobrang underwhelming. Yung supposed BIG VASES puro baso na may tubig -- walang floating candles at sand design na sinasabi niya na meron, wala ring varying size ng candles. Ang lalaki ng gap, hindi man lang napuno. Sobrang nakakabadtrip talaga. During reception, kada daan ko sa mga tabales binilang ko yung candles, hindi man lang umabot ng 30. Yung table runner, ang layo sa color na pinag-usapan. Yung itsura parang pinulot lang sa tira-tira nila. 
9. Ninth, nung dumating na yung mga flowers galing sa church, nilagay nila sa tables para hindi mapansin yung gaps. Malinaw usapan namin na walang bulaklak sa tables. 
10. Tenth, bumili ako ng shells as additional sa tables. Pero parang tinipid pa pag lalagay. Mukhang tanga talaga. 
11. Eleventh, sa contract may charger plates for the VIPs. Pero wala rin. 
12. Twelfth, walang mga names ng guests per seat kasi nililipad daw. (Point is, dapat ready sila. They should have contingencies.) Baka pati adhesive tape wala sila or baka in truth, hindi naman talaga ginawa. 
13. Thirteenth, naubos daw agad yung drinks sa coffee bar and nag exceed pa daw ng 200 pax. How come nag exceed when she mentioned noon pa lang na hindi sila makakapag dala ng buffer drink beyond 180 pax kasi ibbrew pa. Also, ang daming hindi umattend sa bisita namin. Tapos biglang nag exceed. Wala ring customized names sa cups as agreed. 
14. Fourteenth, tapos na yung wedding nung nalaman ko. Yung flowers nung flower girls hindi rin nasunod. Ginawa niyang flower basket na hindi naman yun ang agreement. Yung flowers ng entourage, nilagyan nya ng BLUE RIBBON. She knows the color motif so that says a lot. 

Attached are the screenshots for reference. If I could just attach everything, ilalagay ko talaga. 

Ayun lang, kayo na mag-decide kung scammer ba siya or hindi.

1kk33qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurDream/comments/1kk33qn/the_abyss_stares_back/,The abyss stares back.,"People laugh and have fun on the surface. They make friends and chat. They tell each other jokes, celebrate birthdays, show photos of their pets, make weekend plans, argue about which coffee to buy from the supermarket, talk about their relationships, tag each other on social media, talk about which series they are watching, share recipes, and laugh at internet memes. They share playlists, recommend podcasts, argue about politics they dont understand, flirt over text, complain about the weather, talk about their dreams without depth, pretend to listen, and pretend to care. All of this happens without them being aware of that massive void lying just beneath the surface. It is there, lurking just beyond the edge of every conversation, every action, every emotion and every thought. For some, it beckons. For others, it remains an unfathomable horror. And the vast majority, far from recognizing its presence, continue to paint their lives in shades of distraction and denial.

They say, ""If you turn inward too much, you will commit suicide"" in an automatically dark tone and then walk away, as if life is a responsibility or even an obligation. Because they know the primitive comfort that comes from being attached to physicality and social belonging, not the comfort that comes from escaping existence itself. Only those who go down to the very depths know that. And there, there is an abyss: as if a darkness descending forever downward into the earth. One looks at it. It looks back at the person. One pulls it inward. And it pulls the person into itself. To stare into it is to confront not ""depression"" in the clinical sense, but existential truth in its purest, most uncut form. Not ""sadness,"" but exposure. But to the rest of the people, it was just a mere delirium or ""depression."" The moment a person speaks from the edge of the abyss, society calls for the medics, the prescriptions, the therapies, and the soft language of ""recovery"" or ""healing journey."" Because, they cannot face that persistent silence beneath everything; they build temples, create religions, attach to ideologies, forge belief systems, and become addicted to digital devices in an attempt to ""mute this silence."" But the edge is not always an illness, and more than that, maybe it is never.

They say that this person has detached from ""reality,"" from their tiny world. Tiny world, because that thin layer they are standing on is the only thing that separates them from the whole abyss. The layer is utterly thin, almost like paper, not because reaching the abyss is easy, but because of the narrowness, obliviousness and poverty of perception in the creatures on the surface. Yet, the one who got swallowed by the abyss is living their biggest freedom now, for suicide is not always merely out of ""being in too much pain"" but because of ""realizing things."" It is simply seeing the world for what it truly is for the first time, and insisting on seeing it in this way. And then, voluntarily, departing from existence for an eternal liberation.

Others speak of the ""dangers"" of turning inward, as though to acknowledge the abyss is to court death itself. They speak of suicide as a response to suffering, but that is only one layer of it. It is not suffering alone that drives one to the brink, but the realization that whats called ""life"" is, in its essence, a series of escapes from the ultimate truth of non-being by nature. To truly ""escape existence"" is not simply to flee from pain, but to recognize the illusion of existence itself. A brutal clarity that, once seen, cannot be unseen; perhaps it can only be neutralized, but it can never be destroyed.

Suicide is misunderstood not because it is tragic, but because it is treated and viewed only as being tragic. But of course, it is not the sole choice, if there is even an option to choose; those who still stay on Earth turn into mental exiles, making the abyss their identity.",1,1746975883.0,OurDream,0,1.0,False

Decided to write here since I am out of ideas, demotivated, exhausted and hopeless so maybe I can get a useful tip or advice regarding getting a job in Denmark.

First of all, I am a non EU citizen, but living and working in Copenhagen for more than 7 years with my family. All was great until i lost my job 7 months ago. Used to work in a Fintech company and had many roles there, banking network, sales, relationships, onboarding clients. Came to that company when it was small and was part of the process making it bigger.

But “life happened” and lost the job due to strategy changes within the company.
Ever since I am applying for jobs and still jobless.
Got two times all the way to the end and I was rejected because both of the companies decided to take the internal candidates :(
Have contacted everyone I know here to help me, but people are not much helpful. Which is ok. Also utilised my network, reached to people on LinkedIn who might know someone, but no luck. Some do not even bother to respond to my question or the request for a coffee chat. 
Done everything, changed my CV to match the requirements when applying and still I keep getting rejections. Have done everything…
I am really exhausted and desperate and this situation started to affect my health and sleep.

All I want is someone to give me a chance and hear me out on an interview. I have more than 20 years of payments and banking experience and can fit it in many companies…but nothing is there on the horizon.

Would anyone share some advice? How to proceed? What Am I doing wrong?
Any concrete suggestions please :(

Apologies for this long and perhaps desperate post :(

1kk2pjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1kk2pjp/continue_the_friendship_or_not/,Continue the friendship or not?,"Hey guys,

Just scan through it, if the story is too long. But it’s weighing heavy on me, so I’d appreciate ant advice.

I became friends with a nice, bubbly girl (F) that was already a friend of my best friend. First, I also became couples friend with their respective boyfriends.

However, they both broke up after 5+ years and even asked me how my relation was doing. As if I should follow their path.

Anyway, her (F) new boyfriend (the relationship was up and down), wanted to move to village A. For 1,5 years she said she wanted to move anywhere but A. Also, she cancelled a coffee date because she went to visit a puppy, I didn’t even know she wanted a dog. So I said something like: that will be very difficult if you are not living together (puppies are babies, right?). The same day she bought the puppy and her boyfriend moved in the same night. 

One week later she tells us she is considering buying a house in village A. I am just curious, like, do you really want this? I just wanted to be the person that listened to her perspective, since she told me that she didnt want to go here.

Then one week later we went to a party. We started at home, with our common friend. I told her and her boyfriend that i am happy for them that they take the next step together and informed about their get together story.

At the party, I went to the toilet and saw her. Few drinks later obvs. She acted like a highschool teenager, that I have been avoiding her, and that she felt unsupported by me and our common friend. Also, i talkes to her boyfriend for a bit, and i told him that ofcourse I find it hard that she moves away, but that i got a new car and will be happy to visit them. However, he told her that I was so upset and she was so mad that she didnt hear it from me, but from him. She was also jealous that i talked to him for 30 minutes, while it was my effort to finally get to know her life partner. But she throw her hands up in the air, as a child, crying that i changed and upset her. I talked to her for an hour, until she smiled and danced again. It was against my own needs. Just didnt want to see her cry.

Later, we had dinner and talked it through. She took her responsibility and apoligized. Said she would understand if I wanted to take things easy for a while. I said that, even though i was hurt (because I immediately congratulated her on her new home, bought a toy for her dog and wrote a card), i wanted to keep in touch. But i also told that I want honesty from my best friend, as it comes to feelings, even if her message isnt what i want to hear. She said she wanted the same.

Afterwards, I didnt hear a thing from her, apart from a request to pay the dinner. I waited a bit for her to approach me, since she was the one that was willing to make it up with me. We had a new date with the six of us (three couples), which she cancelled last minute because something was up with her dog. I sent her a private message, that I really hoped her dog was okay. She didnt show up and never replied. However, in the meantime she was crying and complaining about me to our common friend.

I tried to reach out to her more times, but she didnt replied of went very short on me. Eventually, she wanted to go on a lunch with the three of us, which didnt feel right to mee since she has been ignoring mee for a month and had caught up with the other friend, also consulting about me. She said that she also felt tension, specifically because I said things that upset her. Unfortunately, after being ignored for 30 days after specifically saying that I wanted honesty about feelings/needs/expectations, I didnt want to meet her. Just didnt feel safe of heard. She did send me a cute christmas card, but by then my heart was already   like crazy even thinking of her.

So I cancelled the date and disrupted our contact. Our common friend keeps seeing her and tells she is upset et cetera, looking for new friends (4 months further). But i dont feel that she is missing me as a person, more as if she needs someone to fill the gap. Also, i find it very hard that i dutched the bullets (for my friend as well, she said she didnt feel supported of her as well, but she never spoke to her about this. I was just the bad guy and they keep going on like nothing happened, bot conflict avoiding).

But yeah, now I kinda do miss her and the things the three of us were up to. But i dont trust her boyfriend, because he is stirring things up in oir friendship. Also, i donnot like that im the only one speaking up about anything. The girl is so friendly and bubbly and i miss here. But maybe Im better off with friends that meet my values?

Thanks especially to u/MidlineTV who gave me some advice in another thread a while back especially about prepping the week before an event, and someone else I can't remember who said they were going to save up 7 meals worth of Defiant ingredients which I copied and gave me a lot of momentum to start the week strong.

For any newbs/F2P like me:

* Used a GCT (using the GCT strat too) so I could ignore pot mons and if I had some from Meow it was a nice bonus.
* Had the 7 meals worth of Defiant that I farmed up the week before the event, which was quite doable, and I still made it to M12 passively on Snowdrop with just berries and cooking random garbage meals
* My team for the week was: Gardevoir; HSM/HSS/IFM/Modest Aggron with sausage/coffee; BFS Walrein with oil/sausage; and in the last 2 slots I would swap in Dedenne, Vikavolt or Meow when I needed ingredients/felt I could stack tasty+.
* I had bad RNG in the first 12 meals (had tasty+ but it never triggered during mealmaking once)
* I also should've been more systematic in rotating in tasty+ mons but I did halfway through the week which really helped.

Anyway, I'm excited to try these for the rest of the islands now! Thanks again all.",8,1746974745.0,PokemonSleep,2,1.0,False

I'm not looking for a review of the bike or any comments about of that nature. What I **am** curious about is, how to lock the thing. I've only really ever been familiar with u-locks.

The front portion of the frame, where the battery is, is very thick and no u-lock I've found is wide enough to go ""horizontal"" (across the frame and into a rack) across that portion of the frame as that section is 4.5-4.6"" wide (it's where the battery is) and the widest u-lock I've found is 4.4"" wide. In the back triangle of the frame there is that, maybe useless but cute, storage bag setup, so running anything there (u-lock or chain) doesn't seem like a go.

Is it just a cinch chain around the rack/object then around the front triangle, but then a u-lock holding the chain together? I was thinking a foldable lock could work around front tire/front frame for just a minute or two stop to grab snacks/coffee/school drop offs, but for things a little longer \~1 hour, I've feel better with something more substantial than just the foldable lock, ideally 2 locks.",1,1746974557.0,CargoBike,5,0.6,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1kjm7nx/my_crazy_neighbor_poisoned_my_creek_and_stole/)

Big update! The makeshift dam broke and water has been flowing down, but it’s been slow. CN complained to a neighbor up the street that she’s on speaking terms with about me being a major asshole for not letting her kids use my hot spring tub. She let it slip that she poured vinegar in the stream as “justice”. The neighbor was also shown the contract for the pipes and she said that she didn’t even have it signed by me. She and her lawyer had signed it, but without any signature space for me. I thought that she forged my signature, but she didn’t have any agreement (fraudulent or otherwise) on my side whatsoever. The neighbor similarly dislikes her, but their kids are friends, so she has to talk to CN. I sent all the info to a local environmental charity that has contacts within environmental protection agencies. They usually deal with lakes and dumping, so this was in what they deal with regularly.

The police were outside CN’s house a couple hours ago and took her to the station. CN is back at her house, now yelling over the fence profanities while I’m having a coffee. I don’t know if they arrested her and she payed bail or that she just was taken in for questioning or something. I know her brother in law works at the police station, but I wouldn’t doubt that her family members have a strained relationship with her. I hope that she’s stuck with a giant fine and/or jail time. CN’s lawyer still hasn’t served me regarding the pipes, and my lawyer is saying that CN has no case whatsoever. I’ll update as soon as anything interesting comes up.

1kk2jn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1kk2jn8/advice_for_sm_spouse/,Advice for SM spouse,"My husband took a job as a SM last August. He has like 13 years experience in the coffee industry, varying from managing cafes, being a technician for espresso machines, working for roasters, etc. 

He did training at a few stores in the area, then they assigned him a store where the current manager was doing TLA. He started at that store in November and has been there since. It’s still not technically officially his permanent store I guess? 

I’ve read a lot about how being a SM obliterates your work life balance but omg. He’s so miserable. 
They’re understaffed overall but he’s also short At least 2 SSVs and is having a hard time finding people to fill those roles. (No current partners want to/are capable/have the availability). 

My husband cares a lot about the people that work in his store and morale and I could imagine he overextends himself because of this and ends up shooting himself in the foot in a way? 
There is at least one call out, if not multiple, per day, and he more often than not ends up having to fill in for them because nobody else is available or wants to. 
For example, today (Mother’s Day), he had himself scheduled 8-5. Then yesterday one of his openers called out “sick”. Then at 4am his phone rings and another opener was calling out, so he had to go in. 
Now at 9:30, I asked him if he was going to be able to leave earlier than 5 since he went there so early, and he said his teams morale is super low due to the callouts, so he feels obligated to stay and support them. 
(There’s enough people there/coming in later for the store to function without him) 

I also know that he spends a ton of time on the floor and his admin time is suffering. 
My thought process is that he can’t be the most effective manager if HIS morale is also in the gutter and he’s full of resentment from stretching himself so thin.

I guess I just want to know, is there a better way? There has to be. What can he do about the constant callouts, if they say they’re “sick”? (They almost certainly aren’t most of the time)

I take metoprolol 25 mg twice a day along with 20 mg atorvastatin and a 81 mg aspirin. My job can be stressful but since the dissection I’ve been able to control my response to it much better. My wife and I have gone through many difficult trials over the last three years, she is also In perimenopause and stresses out quite a lot. On Saturdays we regularly meet with friends for brunch and it’s the only time I have regular coffee (or any caffeine) and I also have 2 mimosas over an hour and a half or more. My doctor said he couldn’t recommend this but that it was ok with him as long as my BP is consistently good which has been the case through many months of this trend. His reasoning was that if it brought me relaxation and socialization that it could be good, and I feel that it does that. My home lately has become way more stress filled, my wife needs to talk to someone as her stress and anxiety has intensified to a concerning level, and I feel this has been affecting my stress level. Lately, I often feel like I need to let out a big sigh, like stress is accumulating in my chest and it needs to escape. 

Recently, my wife had a stress related episode that resulted in my BP spiking to 186/88 (normally 120s/70s). I made a doctor appointment with a GP and was prescribed Xanax temporarily to take if I get too stressed. I took .75 mg on Thursday and none after that. On Saturday I took my metoprolol and later went to brunch. After one mimosa, 2 cups of coffee and most of my meal I started feeling lightheaded and went to check my pulse, it was beating at a normal rate and not abnormally hard but there were long pauses every few beats. I started drinking water and this continued with sporadic frequency for a few mins. Each time my heart would pause/skip I would feel waves of lightheadedness. I didn’t feel like I had trouble breathing and I wouldn’t say I was close to passing out but if the feeling increased more I worried that was possible. I decided to get up and walk to the bathroom and when I returned to the table my sinus rhythm was normal again. I felt wiped out and still feel a bit tired after almost 24 hours. Friday at work I had some significant stress, I have taken Xanax on several occasions over the last few weeks and I had a small amount of alcohol and caffeine 37 hours after my last dose of it. I only eat out once a week, almost never drink alcohol other than two mimosas on Saturdays. I eat clean home cooked meals at night and I eat small amounts nuts, fruits, meats during the day. I’ve felt “fluttering” in the past and checked my pulse only to find my heart beating normally, and once or twice in my life I have caught a skipped beat but I’ve never had an episode like this where it went on like that. It cause me more anxiety and I’m not sure what to think of it. I do have an appointment coming up and it will be addressed. Any thoughts from the medical community are welcome and appreciated.

1kk2hhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chotul/comments/1kk2hhv/the_genius_wave_reviews_my_honest_thoughts_and/,The Genius Wave Reviews – My Honest Thoughts and Experience,"I wanted to share my take on [The Genius Wave](https://www.ketolifestyle.us/GeniusWave). Quick disclosure upfront: this post contains affiliate links, so if you decide to check it out through the link, I might earn a small commission (at no additional cost). It helps support my work, and I appreciate it!

Now, let's get into it. If you've been hearing about *The Genius Wave* and wondering what it's all about, I've done a deep dive to determine if it's worth the hype. Whether you're curious about boosting focus, tackling stress, or enhancing mental clarity, here's an honest breakdown of what this frequency-based brainwave program offers.

**What Is The Genius Wave?**

*The Genius Wave* is a brainwave audio program designed to activate your brain's theta state in just 7 minutes per session. Leveraging the power of sound frequencies claims to help you tap into peak creativity, focus, and relaxation.

The program is ideal for anyone looking to improve mental functioning, ease stress, or even unlock a ""super-brain"" state. Whether you're a student needing better focus or someone just trying to optimize your day, *The Genius Wave* aims to provide a natural, non-invasive solution.

**How Does It Work?**

At its core, *The Genius Wave* uses theta brainwave frequencies. Theta waves are associated with deep relaxation, creativity, and meditative states. Listening to the soundtrack guides your brain into this specific state, helping you stay focused, relaxed, and mentally sharp. No complicated setup or skills are required – plug in and listen.

Many users report experiencing results after just a few sessions. While results vary, the convenience and simplicity make it an appealing option for busy people.

**Key Features & Benefits**

Here's what stood out to me about *The Genius Wave*:

* **Short sessions:** Only 7 minutes per day to feel the effects.
* **Ease of use:** Available for download as an MP3 file, you can listen anytime, anywhere.
* **Non-invasive:** No fancy gadgets or supplements required – just headphones or speakers.
* **Improves focus and creativity:** Tap into your brain's natural theta state to optimize productivity.
* **Reduces stress:** The calming frequencies make it great for unwinding after a long day.

Bonus? You can access it quickly, making it practical for those needing a fast mental boost.

**Pros and Cons**

Pros:

* ✅ Quick and effective sessions
* ✅ Natural, safe, and easy to integrate into any routine
* ✅ Can be downloaded immediately (no waiting for shipping)
* ✅ Positive reports of reduced stress and increased focus

Cons:

* ❌ Only available online
* ❌ Results can vary depending on the individual
* ❌ Requires consistent use to see long-term benefits

**My Experience with The Genius Wave**

I won't claim it's a miracle cure for everything, but after trying it for a couple of weeks, I noticed subtle but fundamental changes. I often struggle with staying focused when juggling work and personal projects. Listening to *The Genius Wave* soundtrack during my morning routine helped me feel more centered and productive.

What I liked most was how easy it is to use. I would pop in my headphones and play the track while sipping my coffee. It felt like a calming reset button for my brain. Whichever way your day starts, having something so small yet impactful in your corner feels like an instant win.

And I'm not the only one who had positive feedback. Many reviews online echo similar experiences of reduced stress, better focus, and a general sense of ""mental clarity.""

**How to Use The Genius Wave**

The process couldn't be more straightforward:

1. Download the MP3 from their official site.
2. Put on headphones or play them on a speaker (headphones seem to work best for me).
3. Listen for 7 minutes daily, either in the morning to kickstart your brain or before bed to unwind.

That's it! No extra steps or equipment required.

**Why Choose The Genius Wave Over Other Products?**

From my experience, what makes *The Genius Wave* stand out is its accessibility. You don't need to invest in expensive gadgets or attend specialized classes. It's also a natural approach with no side effects – just sound waves doing their thing.

While there are other brainwave programs out there, many of them require a much bigger time commitment. *The Genius Wav*t only takes 7 minutes, making it easy to stick with even on busy days.

**Final Thoughts – Is It Worth It?**

If you're looking for a natural and easy way to enhance focus, creativity, or relaxation, *The Genius Wave* is worth considering. The time commitment is minimal, and the potential benefits are significant. It's not a magic trick; paired with consistency, it can make a difference.

I’ve made some significant lifestyle and diet changes to manage LPR, and despite the challenges, I’ve noticed some real upsides. I’m combining the baseline advice from my own ENT, Dr. Koufman, and Dr. Aviv’s books.. 

Sharing my journal in case helpful for anyone else. Probably not new info, but we’re all different, and maybe something in here will strike a chord:

My main symptoms are: 

• Horrendous chronic cough 

• Intermittent sore throat

• A range of sinus pressure from annoying face pain to splitting headaches

• Dramatic abdominal bloating after eating random foods. (Dr Aviv says this is from misplaced gastric acids and pepsin needed to break down and digest foods)

I have a ways to go, but here’s what’s been moving the needle toward improvement for me:


LIFESTYLE CHANGES

• Waiting 3-4 hours before bed after meals – a game changer for nighttime symptoms

• Taking Pepcid AC 3x daily (including 40 mg at bedtime), and Gaviscon Advance before bed and before yoga

• Waiting at least an hour between meals and exercise, if I don’t, a bronchial-type coughing fit is likely

• Thoroughly chewing food instead the chomp and swallow habit  (hurrying)

• Replacing black coffee first thing in the morning (on an empty stomach) with oatmeal and herbal tea. Per Dr Koufman, allowing one cup coffee with milk or food on occasion now

• Eliminating the “Dirty Dozen’ types of foods– onions, garlic, tomatoes, hot sauce / spice, citrus, chocolate, carbonation, dietary acids, alcohol, preservatives, fried, etc

• Creating a repertoire of safe meals but keeping it interesting with flavors like ginger, aromatic herbs, safe spices, and, ‘finishing’ olive oils for better flavor on chicken, fish, tofu, rice, avocado, various vegetables, homemade soups, etc. Keeping fruits like melon, bananas, and pears around, and, dates, smoothies, and graham crackers for sweet tooth moments

• Drinking alkaline water throughout the day. (I bought filters for my special Brita, and bought drops)

• Staying upright after meals; no kicking back to watch TV at night

• Propping up in bed with European pillows instead of elevating the bed itself

•POSITIVE RESULTS•

• Less coughing overall, especially at night

• Voice still hoarse, but more clarity overall 

• Clearer, quieter breathing when lying down (my nose makes crackling sounds or noises that sound like ‘a seagull crying in the distance’ when exhaling, lol, during flare ups. Drives me nuts)

• Clothes feel looser – possibly from less inflammation and bloating. (I need to lose around 10 lbs, so this is welcome!)

• Fewer sinus headaches and less facial pressure

• Reduced throat burn – still there but less intense. More acute when it does happen. (I can tell what triggers it.)

• More clarity and focus during the day

• Way more physical energy

• More regular bowels – less erratic and more normal. (TMI, but important!)

• Food tastes waaay better – simple things like corn, carrots, and potatoes have so much more flavor now. I don’t have to drown everything in hot sauce and garlic to enjoy a meal. Taste buds are waking up

Hey, friends! 🎉 Can we take a moment to appreciate the fact that turning 50 doesn’t mean we’re heading for the slow lane? If anything, this is just getting started! I mean, who says life can’t be vibrant, exciting, and full of new adventures after 50? 

Think about it: You've got the wisdom, the experience, and maybe even a fresh perspective on what really matters. So let’s tackle some of your burning questions about unlocking that vitality and working smarter, not harder. 

**1. What’s the secret to staying energized?**  
Ah, the million-dollar question! One word: **activity.** But hold on! Before you think running marathons or joining a CrossFit class, let’s break it down.

- *Find what you love:* Dancing, hiking, gardening? It doesn’t have to be a workout—just move! 
- *Consistency is key.* Aim for a brisk walk or a fun yoga class a few times a week. 
- *Fuel your body right.* Ever heard the phrase, “You are what you eat?” A colorful plate is a happy plate! 🍏

**2. How do I manage my time better?**  
Aah, time management! It’s like a magic trick we all want to master. Here’s a simple mantra I live by: **Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.** Seriously, this is a game changer! 

- *Prioritize:* What’s truly important? Make a list, and stick to it.
- *Don’t overcommit.* Remember, it’s okay to say *no* sometimes. Your time is golden! 
- *Break tasks into bite-sized pieces.* Tackle a little at a time, and celebrate those small wins! 🎉 

**3. What about mental wellness?**  
Let’s not forget our minds! They need a workout too!

- *Meditation or mindfulness practices can help.* Consider it mental cardio! A few minutes a day can work wonders.
- *Learn something new.* Ever wanted to play an instrument or learn a language? Dive in! It’ll keep your brain buzzing.
- *Connect with others.* Whether it’s coffee with friends or joining hobby groups, socializing can uplift your spirits.

**4. Can I still achieve my goals?**  
Absolutely! Whether it’s traveling the world, mastering a new skill, or running a marathon (why not, right?), the sky's the limit. Just remember, it’s about the journey, not the destination. 

So, what are some of your goals? Maybe you’re dreaming of writing a book or starting that business you’ve put off for years. 📝 Just remember, keep it real and take it step by step.

1kk2d9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1kk2d9e/found_in_translation/,Found in Translation,"“Greg, come up right away. Oh, and tell the analysts to drop anything they’re working on right now, this takes priority.” She returned the handset to the cradle. The hard-line communication system was older than anything else in the building. In fact, it was older than anything on the moon that wasn’t in a museum or itself a tourist attraction. It was secure, though, and that mattered most.

The swarthy, mustachioed man burst into her office with a harried air and unkempt hair. “What is it, Grace? Did the signal office pick something up?”

Grace turned her monitor around to show Greg. “Not exactly. I got copied on a conversation thread, that I don’t think I was meant to be included in. Sent from the office of Pritnan Antinan.”

“Who the hell is that?”

“If the sound of that name didn’t give it away, he’s from the Nannanan Exclave.”

“I figured that, I just don’t know that name.” Greg studied the message closer and began to point out the other names. “But that’s the Ambassador’s aide, that’s their security chief on the station, and I think that’s their Premier.”

“Right on all. Pritnan Antinan is their Minister of War.” Grace shook her head. “I can’t figure out what this would be about, or why my name would be in the Minister’s contacts. We met here, briefly, at the gala last year. Charming enough for a mass of tentacles, if a little intense, but that’s all I know.”

Greg produced a data crystal and tapped it to the screen. “I’ll get this downstairs to the analysts. We’ll get it decrypted, and then _you_ can figure out what translator to call in, since you’ll have to read them in.”

“The analysts can’t—”

“No. They have one job. Don’t try to confuse them with others.” Greg stopped halfway out the door. “I didn’t know they even _had_ a Minister of War.”

“Seems wholly unlike them, right? They have a Minister for everything they do, and everything they try to avoid at all costs, like the Minister of Disease.”

Greg just grunted and ran back to his underground office. “I’ve got a hot one for you two,” he said.

“Thank you, Greg,” Analyst One said. “We look forward to assisting.”

“How much data do we have?” Analyst Two asked.

“A message thread. Looks like a dozen or so messages, some of them pages long.”

“May I suggest Analyst One begins overall parsing while I start with the shortest messages first?”

“Whatever works best, A-Two,” Greg answered. He tapped the data crystal against the stack of machines in his office, marked ‘A-1’ and ‘A-2’ before sitting at his desk.

“You’ve probably already realized, but the messages are between Nann-Ex members, so I’m unsure what the language will be,” Greg said.

“That’s odd,” Analyst Two said. “These short messages all correspond directly to English and decrypt as such using a simple replacement cipher. There’s really nothing here to challenge us.”

“How do you figure that?” Greg asked. “I’m looking at the encrypted message and the English, but I’m not seeing how it lines up.”

“Does this help?” Analyst-Two asked, displaying the English text written in the symbols of the Nannanan common language.

“The entire message chain is ready for download,” Analyst One said. “If that is all, we shall return to our previous assignments.”

“Thanks,” Greg said, tapping the crystal against his terminal to download the decrypted messages.

He sat beside Grace as they read the decrypted messages together. “Their English is atrocious,” he said.

“It’s not used outside human space. Maybe they figured they’d be able to better hide what they were talking about.” Grace paused. “We don’t have a ship with my name, but that’s what this message says. Is it possible the routing AI passed it on to me when it identified my name?”

“Possible,” Greg answered. “We set up all the infrastructure for the Nann-Ex. Of course, that depends on whether they left it on the default settings.” He paused. “Yeah, that’s probably what happened.”

“I’m more worried about this,” she said, “here. We’re going to war against ourselves?”

“What would make them think that?” he asked.

Grace picked up the handset of the relic and clicked the buttons it rested on a couple times. “Get me General Ochoe.” She listened for a moment. “Good morning, General. We have a worrying message from the Nannanan Exclave. … Sure, come over. I’ll start a fresh pot of coffee.”

As she hung up, Greg was already moving across her office to the coffee pot. “I got this. Extra strong, just like she likes it.”

The general came in as the coffee maker dinged, signifying it was ready to dispense. “Looks like I’m right on time,” she said, putting her Marine Academy mug under the spout. “No cream, no sugar.” The coffee maker filled her mug.

Greg offered her the seat he’d been using, next to Grace. “Something odd’s going on in Nann-Ex.”

“Hello, Greg, Grace,” she said.

Grace took the hint about the niceties. “Hi, Nandi. This message chain is concerning.”

The general sat and sipped her coffee while reading through the messages. “Their English is about on par with half the junior officers.” She chuckled. “This is obviously about the training exercise on Breton. The ship they misidentified as the Grace Alvarez is the Greta Andreesen.”

“How do you figure that?” Grace asked.

“Because the Andreesen is part of the OPFOR for the Breton Resolve exercise, and auto-correct is a thing that will forever haunt us.” Nandi leaned back. “I think we should bring a couple of the Nannanan higher-ups in as observers, including Minister Pritnan.”

“You can do that?” Greg asked. “I know you’ve got some pull, but I didn’t realize—”

“I served with Evan — the SecDef — when we were both butter-bars,” Nandi cut him off. “I’ll send a message and let him know that we should be including them in several training exercises. At least until they get the concept.”

“I don’t understand.” Grace said. “Surely they train.”

“That’s one of those things that was redacted from a number of reports. When the Nannanan were still under Kalari rule, ‘training exercise’ meant something else entirely.” The general sighed. “The Kalari Empire would take the fresh troops along on a sure-win mission in order to get them blooded. It was usually against weak resistance forces, and usually from their own home world.”

“Oh,” Grace closed her eyes. “Damn.”

“Let Ambassador Ritnannan know that we’re inviting his people to the exercise. I’ll call Evan, and we’ll have Minister Pritnan on his way to Breton by this afternoon. Thanks for the coffee.” Nandi stood, downing the last of her coffee, then left the office as though it had been nothing more than a casual chat.

“I’m curious about something,” Greg said. “Can you load up the original message?”

“Why?” she asked, even as she loaded it.

“Examine headers.”

Grace followed his instructions to peer into the formatting of the message.

He chuckled and pointed. “Yep, default settings.”

There, buried in all the metadata from the communication software was the log line, “Contact added to CC; Name found in translation.”

Besides this, I was skinny fat, constantly eating high-carb meals and suffering from intense hunger episodes. Despite exercising, I was always bloated, my belly never flat. About two weeks before my period, I’d be completely drained, unable to get out of bed from extreme fatigue. I was convinced I had PMDD. I tried magnesium, vitamin D, and other supplements, but none of these symptoms changed. For half of each month, I would sleep almost all day, relying on intense coffees to push through, but the fatigue remained. I even heard my own bowel movements, a constant reminder of my messed-up gut. Last year, I missed a friend’s birthday party because I physically couldn’t stand up from exhaustion, and that was the breaking point. I decided to go on strict keto. Within a month, my belly started to flatten, my eye bags disappeared, and that PMDD fatigue vanished completely. Now, I don’t have any of those PMDD-related symptoms, and looking back, I can’t believe how much I was harming my body with sugar and high-carb junk.

1kk2bg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kk2bg4/explore_the_capresso_steam_pro_espresso_machine/,Explore the Capresso Steam PRO Espresso Machine Review: Is it Worth Buying?,"The Capresso 304.01 Steam PRO Espresso and Cappuccino Machine is a sleek little number I’ve had the pleasure of using for my daily caffeine fix. It’s advertised as a 4-cup espresso machine, perfect for crafting cappuccinos, lattes, and other specialty coffee beverages. Initially, I was intrigued by its compact design and modern aesthetics, but after putting it through its paces for a few weeks, I gathered more insights into its performance. While the machine has its fair share of strengths, there are definitely a few sticking points that potential buyers should consider.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was its stainless steel and black finish. It combines an industrial look with compact dimensions (roughly 9.75 x 7.5 x 13.25 inches), making it a great fit for small kitchens or office break rooms. The Capresso Steam PRO doesn’t take up much counter space, and at just 5 pounds, I found it easy to move around when needed. However, the housing is primarily made from ABS plastic with stainless steel accents. While it looks good from a distance, the plastic does feel a bit on the cheaper side when you get up close. Additionally, the glass carafe and curved handle are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

**Functionality and Features**  
This espresso machine is simplistic yet caters to a range of preferences. It comes equipped with an adjustable coffee/steam selector knob, allowing you to tweak the strength of your brew from mild to strong. I personally enjoyed experimenting with these settings to tailor my coffee’s taste, especially on groggy mornings when a strong espresso is non-negotiable. The frother deserves a shoutout as it offers adjustable steam output for crafting either frothy cappuccinos or creamy lattes. That said, I did notice that achieving consistent foam required a bit of a learning curve. 

Another nifty feature is the 4-cup glass carafe that comes included. You can prepare up to four espressos in one go, making it ideal for hosting guests or fueling a productive workday. Filling the water tank is straightforward since you can utilize the carafe itself for precise measurements. Unfortunately, the lack of a built-in water level indicator left me guessing a few times when I wasn't using the carafe.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
The Capresso Steam PRO excels in simplicity. Operating the machine involves just a few buttons and the aforementioned selector knob. Cleaning was surprisingly hassle-free—both the glass carafe and drip tray are dishwasher-safe, while the portafilter features an innovative thumbguard to lock the filter in place. Although this feature is handy, I did find the thumbguard slightly finicky when removing used coffee grounds. It definitely requires a bit of practice to avoid spills, which isn’t ideal for rookie baristas like me.

**Strengths**  
- Compact and stylish design suitable for small kitchens.  
- Adjustable steam selector to personalize coffee strength.  
- Frother delivers light, airy foam for cappuccinos and lattes.  
- Easy maintenance with dishwasher-safe parts.

**Critiques**  
The steam functionality is a mixed bag. I noticed the steam output running out prematurely during some uses, particularly if I was trying to froth milk after brewing the espresso. On top of that, the original frothing tip didn’t meet expectations—it produced more bubbles than foam until I swapped it out for an older frothing tip I had lying around. Another minor grievance was with the strength of the espresso itself. Even on the strongest setting, I found the flavor lacking compared to what I’ve achieved with more premium machines.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Original frothing tip needs better performance for consistent foam.  
- Steam output diminishes during longer coffee prep sessions.  
- Espresso strength could be improved, especially for strong coffee enthusiasts.  

**Product Rivals**  
This machine stands as an affordable alternative to more expensive brands like De’Longhi or Breville. A direct competitor, the De’Longhi EC155, offers a superior frothing system and manages a richer espresso flavor at a slightly higher price point. However, it’s bulkier and not as user-friendly. Breville machines like the Bambino are undoubtedly more high-end, offering advanced temperature controls and consistent foam results, but they come with a significantly steeper price tag. What the Capresso sacrifices in premium features, it makes up for in affordability and straightforward operation.

**Affordable Quality**  
When I compare it to competitors in its price range, this espresso machine hits the mark for budget-friendly coffee enthusiasts. It’s an excellent starter machine for anyone new to making espressos, cappuccinos, or lattes at home. While you won’t get the advanced functionality of high-end machines, the Capresso Steam PRO delivers decent results for its cost. If you’re not too particular about perfect foam or high-intensity espresso, this is worth every consideration.

ok, now onto the reviews!

**SOLSTICE MAGNOLIA (OIL)**

*(Lemon-Magnolia ice cream, sugar cone, Hawaiian sandalwood, honeysuckle, thumbprint cookies with quince jam, unsweetened iced black tea)*

smells like feet. i am not putting this on my skin. i’m not doing it i’m not brave enough to do this. WHAT is up with ss’ citrus notes? i don’t understand what’s going on here, it just smells like molded citrus fruits? i’m just, so discombobulated right now, i have never had such a terrible hit rate with a house before. like, i KNOW that i’m very very picky with what i consider great and i rarely FS but man! this is terrible! i have so many alkemia samples i’d like to destash simply because i find them meh, but at least i keep coming back for more. but this? god, i’m sorry but i’m highly considering tossing it just to get it out of my house.

***0/5***

**SPIRIT TREE (OIL)**

*(Gardenia, Vanilla, Jasmine, Sandalwood, Soft Woods blend, Orange Blossom, Magnolia)*

sandalwood and you guessed it, feet. again. i swear, ss’ magnolia and sandalwood scents just turn into the grossest thing ever. i’m so sorry, i don’t want to be mean when reviewing but my goodness, i can’t ever see myself wear this or even try to destash it to someone else. i smell literally NOTHING else in the bottle except for sandalwood and molded citruses, and maybe magnolia. i can’t, i can’t do it, i’m not strong enough to try it on my skin.

***0/5***

**ORIENT ROSE (OIL)**

*(Rose Absolutes, Rose Ottos, Rose de Mai, Rose Attar, Tea Rose Accord, Vanilla Musk, White Musk, Ambergris (vegan), Amber, Indian Vetiver)*

literally made me say “what the fuck” out loud when opening the vial. this thing is FOUL. smells like if you took the same rose in fantome’s finist but it’s like, rotten. and left out to rot for about a month, there’s something that’s desiccated in here and frankly i’m too afraid to smell it again. 

***0/5***

**MANOR (OIL)**

(*Woody-Vanilla Musk, Vanilla, Agarwood (Oud), Sandalwood)*

well, i mean, it’s not bad in the bottle. and that’s nice, compared to the previous ss fragrances i’ve tried, but to me it just smells sort of like, stale sandalwood and a hint of oud? i’m actually willing to try this one on my skin. has poor projection, and i can’t really smell it when putting my nose right up to it. i don’t get the hype for this at all. it just smells like i rubbed some sandalwood onto my skin. i don’t get any vanilla at all. but all things considered, i’m glad it didn’t go complete funk on my skin.

***2/5***

**ESTATE VANILLA (EDP)**

*(Raw Vanilla Pods, Vanilla Infused Sugar, Cream & Vanilla Extract.)*

yeah that’s vanilla alright. before it sort of smelled like tootsie rolls but that’s faded, i don’t know there’s just nothing that really knocks my socks off with this one. i don’t really understand the hype around it. also the projection isn’t great, i know that edps are usually supposed to have better projection than oils but this is not impressing me at all.

***2/5***

**BLACKBURN FARMSTEAD (OIL)**

*(Blackberry Jam, Boysenberry Preserves, Vanilla Bean, Creamy Vanilla and a touch of Vanilla Musk)*

smells exactly like biting into a blackberry gummy, like it’s chewy? i feel like i’m eating this for some reason, maybe because it is SO strong in the bottle. this stuff is intense just in the vial. loses a lot of projection when it comes into contact with my skin. i mean, for what it’s advertised as it’s a, dare i say, pleasant blackberry scent but it’s pretty linear. there’s no vanilla in here that i can smell.

***3/5***

**BLACKBURN'S PARLOR (OIL)**

*(Vanilla Waffle Bowl, Vanilla & Chocolate Ice Creams, Banana, Caramel, Whipped Cream)*

surprisingly accurate cavendish banana and chocolate! and just the faintest hint of whipped cream in the background. however there’s also this very, i guess artificial quality to it that makes me feel like i shouldn’t be smelling this, like it hurts to smell a little. i think the banana is doing that to be honest. has better projection that the other ss’ smells i’ve been brave enough to put to skin but that isn’t saying much. there’s another fruit that comes out to play when i put it to skin, but i can’t really name it? turns from actual cavendish banana into ugh, it’s just on the tip of my tongue. but it delves from banana into more juicy fruit territory. just the faintest whisper of chocolate, and no waffle cone to be seen.

***2.5/5***

**POSTPRANDIAL (OIL)**

*(Vanilla, Irish Cream, Coffee, Chocolate, Bourbon, Pipe Tobacco)*

like prying off the lid of a bottle of bourbon and huffing it. nearly pure alcohol in the bottle, it’s like sniffing rubbing alcohol. it’s enough to make nearly anyone recoil a bit. bitter, with the same sort of vanilla veneer present in estate vanilla. this is what drinking vanilla extract would be like in scent form. on skin it dissolves to a sort of root beer smell? but with actual beer in it. yeah, root beer, heavy emphasis on the beer and a sad bowl of melted vanilla ice cream. also has absolutely terrible projection on me, i can barely smell it with my nose damn near pressed right against it.

***1/5***

**MIDNIGHT EYE (OIL)**

*(Dark Coffee, Cigar Leaf, Cacao, Carob, Tonka, Labdanum, Aged Patchouli, Fossilized Amber, Cigar Ash, Oud)*

like a cigar and oud had a baby. and don’t get me wrong i like oud, very much more than i do sandalwood actually but this is a lot. heavy, oppressive and frankly not suitable for daily wear in my opinion. another ss perfume where i feel like i’m doing damage to my olfactory and nervous system by smelling it. clings to the back of my nose like it lives there. if you like singeing your nose hairs for some reason then this is your best bet. yeah, all other notes are crushed mercilessly under the heel of oud and cigars.

***0/5***

**SNOWMINT MALLOW (OIL)**

*(Peppermint, Vanilla Cake, Sugar Cookies, Flaked Coconut & Marshmallow Crème)*

oh this is quite nice actually, very mint heavy in the bottle but there’s nice sweetness to it. it actually feels cool to my nose when i smell it. smells like thin mint girl scout cookies, (i have native’s shampoo in the same smell but this is better.) yes, this is how i smell like after a shower lol, because i use native’s thin mint shampoo and their coconut macaroon conditioner. it’s not bad, but i already smell like this most of the time. projection on skin isn’t that great. the peppermint mellows out a lot on the skin and the cooling mentholated feeling dissipates, more vanilla forward now that the mint takes a back seat. it’s nice, but it’s not wow-worthy to me. actually, the mint takes more of an irish goodbye, and it’s only been, about 45 seconds since i put it on my skin?

***2.5/5***

**SUGARVALE (OIL)**

*(Candied Pecans, Butterscotch, Buttered Rum, Brown Sugar, Maple Syrup, Hot Pralines & Milk Chocolate Cocoa.)*

immediately it’s butterscotch and buttered rum heavy in the bottle, very butter heavy which i’m not a huge fan of. there’s also a sort of nuttiness to it which i believe comes from the pecans and the pralines? it’s like snacking on candied nuts and sipping on a butterscotch buttered rum cocktail between bites. the maple doesn’t stand out a lot to me, and the milk chocolate isn’t present either. it’s mainly nutty and buttery in the vial. stays mostly the same on skin as well, and maybe there’s just a whisper of maple there as well. it’s alright, but it’s not something i see myself wearing.

***2.3/5***

**ROSE MALLOW CREAM (OIL)**

*(Moroccan Rose absolute, Bulgarian Rose absolute, Marshmallow Fluff, Strawberry Nectar, White Chocolate, Vanilla, White Musk)*

no. same dusty desiccated rose in orient rose, there is nothing sweet or nice or mallow-y about this one. i don’t know how this one turned out so different from the listed notes but it’s uh, it’s not good. like marshmallows if you took everything out of them and only left the gelatin, and like, a dusty rose coughed on it.

***0/5***

**NIGHTGOWN (OIL)**

*(Vanilla, White Chocolate, Tuberose & Tiare Flowers.)*

it’s nothing that really blows me out of the water. creamy sort of white flower smell, i think it’s mainly the tiare? white chocolate is non existent, it’s not an offensive scent by any means but i think that it works against it in this case. doesn’t wow me. 

smells like fantome's olwyn, but it’s a lot less complex. i think my skin amps creamy white florals too much, and i much prefer jasmine as my white flower.

***2.8/5***

**ESTATE CITRUS (EDP)**

*(Orange, Grapefruit, Orange Blossoms, Sweet Tea with Lemon, Estate Vanilla, Honeysuckle, Saffron, Yakusugi Wood, Amber, Patchouli, Distant Coastal Wind)*

doesn’t smell citrusy at all, there’s nothing in here that screams citrus to me despite this being chock full of orange and grapefruit, i don’t know it just smells like molded oranges. sillage isn’t good either for being an edp.

***1/5***

well, there you have it folks. hopefully my experiences can help someone out in the end, so that it wasn't entirely a bust. it looks like i just have a bone to pick with ss' sandalwood and citruses and florals. sometimes the whole house is a bust, and sometimes it's all great and sometimes it's a mix of both, all apart of the fragrance journey i suppose. (though i do feel a headache brewing after smelling all of these.)

1kk28kv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kk28kv,First Brandcoin in defi: $Kendu,"There’s crypto. And then there’s Kendu Inu.

$KENDU isn’t a meme token. It’s a decentralized brand that refuses to ask permission. It’s rebellion, ownership, and culture packaged as code. You don’t need a team. You don’t need a license. You just need vision and the will to move.

This is the first real brand coin. A cultural currency. A signal. And the people building under the Kendu name aren’t waiting. They’re launching. They’re creating. They’re taking the brand into the real world with:

• A Kendu board game
• A Kendu games studio with former Bioware and AAA devs
• Kendu energy drinks and spirits
• Kendu coffee, chocolate, and candy
• Apparel, jewelry, and street events
• An eSports team
• Kendu Entertainment in India

No marketing budget. No influencers. No fake volume. Just humans doing what they do best when you remove the walls and let the community lead.

Kendu doesn’t run on hype. It runs on belief. The holders aren’t investors. They’re builders. They’re owners. They don’t wait for announcements. They are the announcement.

And when it came time to prove credibility, the Kendu army showed up. Fifty thousand real people voted to get Kendu CertiK-audited. No tricks. No manipulation. Just trust. The result? A 98 out of 100 score.

You don’t buy into Kendu. You live it. You wear it. You build with it. The token is more than a line of code. It’s a key to a global identity. A decentralized canvas powered by thousands of independent creators.

1kk27k4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kk27k4/i_am_a_retired_sanatorium_caretaker_and_ive_got/,I am a retired sanatorium caretaker and I’ve got some stories for you.,"I’ll make this bit short and sweet. I doubt you folks want to hear my life story, so I’ll just cut to the chase. 

I’ve spent the past nearly 30 years - oh hell, it’ll be 30 years next year, working as a caretaker for an old abandoned sanatorium. Technically we’d call it a psychiatric hospital here, but it’s about a 45 minute drive from a mid-size city here in the UK. 

I won’t tell you which one or its exact location, but chances are you might have come across it on one of those paranormal ghost hunting shows that are so popular, although God only knows why. 

Charlie - that’s my nephew - tells me that people on this forum love to hear all about the unexplained and creepy shit and I’ve stockpiled plenty of those over the past 3 decades of slaving my life away for barely any pension worth a damn. 

You might be wondering what the point of a caretaker is if the sanatorium is already shut down? You’d be right to ask, since it’s not been operational since about the 1950s. It opened in the 1790s and throughout the 19th century, it was used to treat things like tuberculosis, the clinically insane were kept here for safety and far away from the public and some unfortunate women were treated for what was then known as “hysteria”.

I wouldn’t be surprised with the current administration across the pond if that’s the direction things might be headed again. 

Anyway, I’m getting sidetracked. 

Several years after it closed, the sanatorium was originally meant to be turned into one of those haunted house attractions, but it was soon found out that the renovation would be too expensive and so those plans were abandoned. 

For a brief point in time, the local council decided it could be used as a museum and that lasted a couple of years or so before they realised that there wasn’t enough interest from the public due its location and some individuals had voiced health and safety concerns. 

Given that it’s a historically listed building, it’s basically a criminal offense to demolish it and the council figured they might as well keep it and let mother nature do its job. Not wanting to get in trouble for neglect or making it easy for other people to damage, it was decided that a caretaker was needed. 

Enter yours truly. 

Now, you might be asking yourself - why on earth would you choose to do a job like that? Doesn’t it get lonely? Don’t you get scared? The honest answer is - no - I don’t. If I had to spend the rest of my days working in an office hearing about what Nicki did on the weekend with her kids or that Alan’s wife has taken up painting and she’s actually rather good and I should come around for tea, I’d sooner rather die early. 



Gosh, I promised to make it short didn’t I? 

Anyway, that just about covers it, though. My  job is to make sure nothing or nobody unwanted gets in.  

Where do I start with the weird stuff? The thing is, after a while, you get so used to it that it becomes normal and sometimes it’s hard to distinguish the normal-weird to the “what-the-fuck-is-happening.” weird, but I’ll do my best. 



\- I’d only been working at the sanatorium about a week or so when I had my first, I guess “supernatural” encounter. It still feels weird calling it that, because I’ve always been a skeptic. After all, I did my degree in biomedical sciences and always firmly believed what I can see and what I can touch. My shifts are usually a mix between night shifts and day shifts, but as you can imagine, not a lot of people tend to break into places in broad daylight. 

Night shifts typically start around 10PM and finish in the wee hours and it’s usually a steady patrol around the property, starting on the ground floor, working my way to the basement, then up to the first and second floor.  Rinse and repeat and it makes for a very boring 8 hours, so I usually pack a book, some crosswords. A couple of Christmases ago, my sister’s family gifted me one of those Nintendo switches because I rather like those farming games and it’s an easy way to kill time.

I was about 4 hours into my shift and ready for my second cup of coffee to stay awake. The little office I sat in was maybe one of the few rooms in the entire building not deteriorating at quite the same rate as the rest of the place. It had everything I needed; a relatively comfy chair to snooze on, some decrepit, very of their time WWII propaganda booklets to read and my digital farm. 

I must have nodded off at some point because I woke up to what felt like someone tugging at my trouser pockets. When I looked up, there was nobody there and the room got really chilly, as if I’d stepped into one of those industrial freezer rooms. Against my better judgement I decided to ignore it, but a few seconds later I heard laughter. 

Children’s laughter. 

“Hello? Anyone there?” I called out as if anyone would reply. 

I got up and investigated the source of the sound and as I walked out into the main foyer, I saw what looked like a small child running up the stairs to the first floor and then it stopped. I ran after it, but once I got up to the first floor there was nobody there. Believe me, I checked every bloody room. 

I brushed that first encounter off as being just a bit sleep deprived and not yet used to night shift work, but those children’s laughter and running footsteps became almost a recurring phenomenon. These days, I don’t even give it a second thought because there are far worse things lurking within the walls of that place. 



\- When I started working in the mid to late 90s, YouTube didn’t exist. However, once in a while film crews making documentaries on the paranormal wanted to come and spend a few hours looking around the sanatorium. 

I never understood why the owners agreed to it, but I think it was an easy way to get a bit of money. These film crews were all the same, just in it for the sake of entertainment and not because they actually believed in ghosts. They always brought with them those fake mediums, always putting on a show for the camera.  

I was tasked with showing them around the building and the medium that worked for this particular crew was different from the others I’d met. She seemed more level-headed and a bit withdrawn. She’d said nothing throughout the tour, but when we got to the second floor, she stopped in the doorway to what was the old nurses’ sleeping quarters. 

She stayed there for a while, just silent and as one of her colleagues was about to see if she was okay, she spoke. 

“He’ll never stop coming.” she said, her voice low and perfectly calm, “He’ll never stop coming.” 

And then just like that, she snapped out of it. I’ll never forget the look in her eyes when we asked her who she was talking about and I wouldn’t understand it myself until much later.   


\- It’s not uncommon for people - especially kids - to go missing around here. As you can imagine, abandoned buildings like this are popular amongst not only urban explorers, but teenagers messing around. 

In the early 2000s, maybe around 2003, I got a call from the local police station saying a kid was missing and asked if I could help find him. It’s usually always the same, a group of kids break in, see who can last the longest before they get spooked and one of them gets left behind. 

This wasn’t one of those times. Apparently, a family was camping in the campground not far from the hospital and when the parents woke up to see their son missing, they called the police.   
I found the kid, pressed up against the wall in the basement scared out of his mind and when I asked what had happened, he told me the man in the Tweed said to come meet his friends and when they got here, he’d been left alone, except for the company of a little boy who’d run around laughing. 



\- Now, the Man in Tweed….just thinking about him sends shivers down my spine. The first time I met him was about a few years into my contract. I’d parked up my car as I always did and unloaded my stuff when I noticed someone standing on the front porch of the building. 

He was an odd bloke; wearing a pair of brown tweed trousers and a matching suit, with a pocket watch hanging out from his right pocket and a cigar in the other. 

“You alright, mate?” I called out, “Can I help you?” 

“You must be Alan?” said the stranger confidently, “Your boss told me I’d find you here. I’m the surveyor.”

I immediately knew it was bullshit, because if there’s one thing my boss is good at, it’s keeping me in the loop with what’s going on. Not to mention that I sure as hell know there is no surveying being done of the property. 

“At this time of night?” I asked

“Oh right, yeah.” the stranger scratched his head, “This is really embarrassing, but I was here earlier with your boss and left my bag inside and I need it for work so if you could just let me in so that I can grab it real quick and be out of your hair?” 

Something about the way he smiled as he looked at me seemed…almost uncanny and every inch of my body told me this was a bad idea. 

“I’m really sorry, but if anything was left in there my boss would have told me. I’ll have a look on my shift and if I find something I can hand it into the office and you can pick it up from there. Unfortunately I can’t let anyone inside as we have rules to follow and I’m sure you’ll appreciate that.”

A silence lingered between us and the expression in the stranger’s face shifted to something between annoyed and amused. 



“Man of principle” he chuckled, “I respect that. Alright, I’ll be on my way. Let me know if you find something.”

“Will do.” I promised

“I’ll be seeing you very soon, Alan.” 

The man lifted his hat and walked off into the woods. I realised then that there was no other car parked and no conceivable way that he could have easily gotten here. I rang my boss not long afterwards and he confirmed my fears. He’d never scheduled an appointment with a surveyor and hadn’t been to the property for a few days. He told me to let him know if this stranger showed up again and I said I would. The moment I hung up my phone I suddenly recalled what that psychic medium had said. 

“He’ll never stop coming.”



Oh shit, is that the time? I got a bit carried away, but I hope you’ve enjoyed reading some of these stories. It’s actually nice getting them off my chest. If you have any questions or want me to share some more let me know. I wish we’d have had the internet and forums like this back when I first started.

1kk26jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kk26jn/does_the_cuisinart_coffee_center_combo_brewer/,Does the Cuisinart Coffee Center Combo Brewer SS-16 Deliver? Comprehensive Review Inside!,"**My Experience with the Cuisinart SS-16 Coffee Maker**

The Cuisinart SS-16 Coffee Maker has been a permanent fixture on my kitchen counter for a while now, and having put it through its paces every day, I’ve got plenty to share. This stainless-steel coffee machine instantly grabbed my attention for its versatility. The idea of a 2-in-1 coffee maker that blends single-serve convenience with a carafe brewing option seemed like the answer to my household's caffeine needs. As someone who juggles multiple blends and preferences in a home filled with coffee lovers, I was excited to test it thoroughly.

**Design That Speaks Both Style and Practicality**

From a design perspective, this coffee maker genuinely fits well in a modern kitchen. Its brushed stainless-steel exterior doesn’t just scream premium—it also resists smudges, which is a huge plus when you’ve got curious kids or messy mornings. At 10.88 x 10.13 x 16.25 inches, it isn’t overly bulky but still manages to feel substantial. The buttons on this device are intuitive, and the easy-view water window makes setup straightforward. I appreciate how the machine feels sturdy, even though it's not the sleekest option out there. This coffee maker might not be the smallest appliance you’ll ever own, but hey, you’re getting two brewing systems combined into one, so it’s bound to take up a bit of space.

**How It Performs in Daily Use**

Performance is where this coffee maker shines, but it’s not without quirks. With single-serve options ranging from 4 oz to 12 oz, I had no problem brewing everything from a quick pre-work espresso shot to filling my travel mug for a long day. It’s compatible with Keurig K-Cup pods, which my family loved, but the HomeBarista reusable filter was my go-to since it let me use my own freshly ground coffee. Having the flexibility to brew a full 12-cup carafe when guests are over or an iced coffee on sunny afternoons is what sold me on this machine. The Extreme Brew tech that speeds up brewing is impressive—it’s noticeably faster than other coffee machines I’ve used.

**Grab [Cuisinart SS-16] at the best price on Amazon.** 

With that said, cleaning the machine did involve some minor headaches. While the charcoal water filter ensures a clean taste, it requires regular care. Oh, and let’s just say the self-clean mode isn’t as magical as the marketing suggests.

**Positives**

- Single-serve and carafe brewing make it versatile for any occasion.
- Extreme Brew feature delivers coffee faster than standard drip machines.
- Reusable filter supports eco-friendly habits.
- Brew Pause allows grabbing a cup mid-cycle.
- Adjustable brew strength for light to bold coffee.

**Negatives**

- The drip tray area can feel cramped when using taller mugs.
- Cleaning the single-serve side often felt cumbersome.
- Some parts feel overly plasticky compared to the sleek stainless-steel exterior.

**Features That Make It Stand Out**

When discussing features, it’s impossible to ignore how customizable this coffee maker is. I loved the 24-hour brew start option, allowing me to wake up to freshly brewed coffee every morning—a routine I will never give up now! The carafe water temperature and brew strength controls let me tailor my coffee just the way I like it. And the inclusion of the Brew Pause system, which lets you sneak a cup before the pot finishes brewing, is genius. The one lets-down? The warmer plate only keeps the carafe at a comfortable temperature for around an hour before letting it cool down.

**Competitive Options in the Same Category**

Some rivals in this price range do rival what the Cuisinart SS-16 Coffee Maker offers. Take the Ninja DualBrew Coffee Maker, for instance. It provides similarly flexible brewing options and performs slightly better for specialty drinks like lattes. That said, the Cuisinart powers through with its reusable filter and better overall build quality. Compared to premium Keurig models, you’ll sometimes miss the ability to control temperature for single-serve. However, Cuisinart’s dual water reservoirs and unique brew methods make it more of a fit for larger households or those who crave variety in their coffee routine. 

**Cost Efficiency Compared to Alternatives**

Is the Cuisinart SS-16 worth the splurge? Honestly, it’s solid in terms of cost-effectiveness. Dual functions in one machine mean fewer appliances clogging up your counter, and the reusable filter saves cash on paper filters or exclusive pods over time. While some users might experience minor wear-and-tear issues on the brewing components, this coffee maker genuinely feels like smart spending with its mix of convenience, versatility, and robust performance.

Sunday Morning  
by Wallace Stevens

I  
Complacencies of the peignoir, and late  
Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair,  
And the green freedom of a cockatoo  
Upon a rug mingle to dissipate  
The holy hush of ancient sacrifice.  
She dreams a little, and she feels the dark  
Encroachment of that old catastrophe,  
As a calm darkens among water-lights.

The pungent oranges and bright, green wings  
Seem things in some procession of the dead,  
Winding across wide water, without sound.  
The day is like wide water, without sound,  
Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet  
Over the seas, to silent Palestine,  
Dominion of the blood and sepulchre.

II  
Why should she give her bounty to the dead?  
What is divinity if it can come  
Only in silent shadows and in dreams?  
Shall she not find in comforts of the sun,  
In pungent fruit and bright, green wings, or else  
In any balm or beauty of the earth,  
Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven?  
Divinity must live within herself:

Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow;  
Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued  
Elations when the forest blooms; gusty  
Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights;  
All pleasures and all pains, remembering  
The bough of summer and the winter branch.  
These are the measures destined for her soul.

III  
Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth.  
No mother suckled him, no sweet land gave  
Large-mannered motions to his mythy mind.  
He moved among us, as a muttering king,  
Magnificent, would move among his hinds,  
Until our blood, commingling, virginal,  
With heaven, brought such requital to desire  
The very hinds discerned it, in a star.

IV  
Shall our blood fail? Or shall it come to be  
The blood of paradise? And shall the earth  
Seem all of paradise that we shall know?  
The sky will be much friendlier then than now,  
A part of labor and a part of pain,  
And next in glory to enduring love,  
Not this dividing and indifferent blue.

V  
She says, ""I am content when wakened birds,  
Before they fly, test the reality  
Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings;  
But when the birds are gone, and their warm fields  
Return no more, where, then, is paradise?""

VI  
There is not any haunt of prophecy,  
Nor any old chimera of the grave,  
Neither the golden underground, nor isle  
Melodious, where spirits gat them home,  
Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palm  
Remote on heaven's hill, that has endured  
As April's green endures; or will endure  
Like her remembrance of awakened birds,  
Or her desire for June and evening, tipped  
By the consummation of the swallow’s wings.

VII  
She hears, upon that water without sound,  
A voice that cries, ""The tomb in Palestine  
Is not the porch of spirits lingering.  
It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay,  
And leave the earth to paradise the soul.""

VIII  
At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make  
Ambiguous undulations as they sink,  
Downward to darkness, on extended wings. ```",3,1746973392.0,redscareover30,1,1.0,False

2. **To help myself** – I’m just trying out and slowly building a portfolio. Every project I do helps me learn, grow, and hopefully earn even just enough to buy a cup of coffee.

I’ve got a lot of free time at home right now, and I’m not really making much money. So, I thought I’d try to use my time to help others.

f you need someone to design or clean up your slides, I’d be happy to help. I promise to be reasonable, understanding, and fair with my pricing. Even just enough to cover a cup of coffee or a small meal would mean a lot to me.

My Offer:

* **₱5-10 per slide** – basic, clean, organized layouts using Canva or Google Slides

Other things I can do:

I’m doing something something something… 


Character 1 comes to a room to bring me coffee. So and so. 

Would that be confusing with spacing? Even if the reader knows that they dead? Or do I use inner monologue to tell the memory? But I kinda want my character to be a bit lost in her mind mixing reality and mind… I want to do small moments and I don’t I want to do it chapterly.

1kk225i,https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1kk225i/what_a_difference_a_day_makes/,What a difference a day makes.,"First off, let me say that most of my problems can be laid right at my feet. User error and being unfamiliar with the system isn't a viable complaint.

  
I am a very experienced gamer, and I run alphas and betas on a regular basis. My MMO experience began with Ultima Online back in the 90s on Atlantic, and just went from there. But this system was giving me fits yesterday. Learning the hard way that while you are trying to read the help screens and exploring the tabs doesn't stop the danger was a hard shock. Was running in the red constantly for water and sun exposure, and I don't know if I like that. I think the n00b area needs to be a bit more forgiving. 

  
The skills and research tabs are clunky. And I'm still not sure about what I'm supposed to be doing on the research tab. Why do I have so many points that I can't spend? It's very clunky to me.

  
Building was easy and pretty fun, but again, once you get used to it. Yesterday saw me building a crappy building just to do the requirements for the quest. Todays building was prettier.

  
I'm to blame for the crappy experience yesterday in combat. I've been rather fixated lately in the turn based Warhammer 40k games, so my FPS skills have atrophied. I DO NOT LIKE that the audio and visual cues for enemies near sucks. My first indicator of being near enemies is the 'OH NOES!!! YOU DYING!!!' alarms across the screen. Do not like.

  
Map and compass bar are weak in my opinion. Took me a bit to understand the waypoint system, and even longer to get how to remove waypoints.

  
So yesterday was challenging. I died over and over and over and over. So today I deleted and started a new toon. In the time it took me to drink a cup of coffee I made it as far as it took me ALL DAY to do yesterday. I think that is a bonus for players. If I was paying for this, I'd be a little irked that I wasted a day, but understanding the system, for the most part, in a day isn't too bad.

My question to Singaporean men, how prevalent is the requirement these days?

My experience points toward it not being an issue. I've had hook ups, dates, relationships and finally a wife from dating apps. Meanwhile I am in debt. Never once did these women look for me gold in me because I had none.",0,1746973007.0,askSingapore,12,0.27,False

Fast forward, I'm walking around and a bunch of people who walked past me from behind take a look back, which makes me really confused, but I didn’t think much of it since i have distinct hair and thought maybe it was that... it wasn’t, I continued to walk around, going into stores, coffee shops, for around an hour.

My dress had completely slid up and I was just walking around wearing stockings, boots, and a puffer jacket like a crazy person. I didn't feel it sliding since it has the wool inside I didnt feel any change of ""wind"" if you know what i mean lmao. To make it worse, it looked really bad because they had that diaper back with the zipper to open like a baby, and they were kind of short on me so they looked super saggy like i had a shitt\* diaper on.

Looking for something real, no rush, no pressure. Whether it becomes a relationship or a solid friendship, I’m all for deep connections built on trust and presence. Real talk, good vibes, and meaningful moments.

About me:

Coder by day, nuclear physics nerd by heart. I prepare to PhD, so my nights are a mix of equations and coffee-fueled study sessions (TOEFL & GRE adventures included). Life’s intense sometimes, but I find peace in the small things.

I love deep convos that last until midnight, spontaneous night walks, and wandering through quiet city streets that most people overlook. There’s magic in the hidden corners of the world.

Dreaming of a motorcycle trip through Europe, open road, fresh air, no set plans. The back seat is open if you’re into spontaneous adventures and great playlists.

I’m also in the middle of a fitness journey, building strength and feeling good. Thinking about my first tattoo. you got any awesome designs or stories to share?

What I’m looking for:

Someone emotionally grounded, kind, curious. Someone who doesn’t mind sitting in silence sometimes, or sharing weird thoughts and real feelings. If you’re someone who feels deeply and values presence, we might just get along.

If something here made you smile or feel seen, say hi. Or just tell me one random thing that made today a little brighter for you.
