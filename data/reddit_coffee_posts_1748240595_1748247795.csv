ich bin kein Lehrer, aber arbeite gerade an einem eigenen kleinen Projekt und hoffe auf eure ehrliche Meinung ‚Äì denn ich wei√ü, dass Kaffee in Lehrerzimmern nicht nur ein Getr√§nk, sondern fast schon Ritual ist üòÖ

Ich entwickle gerade TropiCoffee ‚Äì eine neue Art von Kaffee, die dezent fruchtig schmeckt. Nicht durch Sirup oder Zucker, sondern durch nat√ºrliche Aromen, die nach dem R√∂sten auf die Bohnen aufgetragen werden (Sorten wie Orange, Blaubeere, Erdbeere, Kokos).  
Die Bohnen (50‚ÄØ% Arabica / 50‚ÄØ% Robusta aus Brasilien) werden in √ñsterreich ger√∂stet, sind zuckerfrei, vegan und sollen hei√ü oder kalt getrunken werden k√∂nnen ‚Äì als Cold Brew, Iced Latte oder ganz klassisch.

Mir ist klar, dass das sehr speziell klingt ‚Äì deshalb meine ehrliche Frage an euch:

‚Äì W√ºrdet ihr sowas probieren ‚Äì oder ist das kompletter Unfug?  
‚Äì Was w√§re euch bei sowas wichtig? (Design, Verpackung, Herkunft, Preis, ‚Ä¶)  
‚Äì Was denkt ihr: Spielerei oder etwas, das in der Schule vielleicht sogar im Lehrerzimmer stehen k√∂nnte?

Ich bin ein Ein-Mann-Startup aus √ñsterreich, und bevor ich richtig launche, will ich genau solche R√ºckmeldungen h√∂ren ‚Äì auch wenn sie hart ausfallen.  
Wenn jemand neugierig ist, kann ich gerne den Link zum Projekt dalassen ‚Äì aber nur, wenn‚Äôs gew√ºnscht ist. Will hier nicht werben, sondern einfach ehrliches, gerne auch kritisches Feedback.

Danke euch f√ºrs Lesen ‚Äì und vielleicht ja f√ºr den einen oder anderen Gedanken dazu üôè‚òïüìö",0,1748247634.0,lehrerzimmer,1,0.5,False

1kvp4lq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1kvp4lq/how_do_you_deal_with_his_neverending_obsession/,How do you deal with his neverending obsession with the side supply?,"As my previous post said, I am one of those who don't have the luxury to leave.
It's been 2 years since he has this online relationship with the side supply that he probably gonna meet in person to have sex soon.

He has been obsessed with her ever since and he brought everything about her to this house. Whenever the other woman post about something, my husband would immediately doing it. Even if it's something that he doesn't do before or out of character. Just some examples below:
- The side supply likes coffee. My husband has stomach problem and never drinks coffee since he was a teenager but he'd drink coffee and buy coffee flavor anything these days.
- She has redhead (I'm sorry for other redhead out there, I'm not talking about all of you generally), now every movie and shows that he watches, or game he plays, must have look alike redheads character who look like the side supply in it. He said one time the side supply look like Julia Roberts in Hooks, and he'd force me to watch that movie with him multiple times with undivided attention. To the point it ruined some movie or shows or actors I really liked before. (I'm a movie enthusiast). I think an example that pissed me off so much was when I suggested him IT crowd since forever ago, and he never took any interest on what I am suggesting ever, he'd never, ever watching my shows. He would always brush it off. Guess what, now he puts IT crowd and watching it on repeat cause Diane Morgan look like the side supply. At the same time now it ruined IT Crowd for me forever, I really love that show. 
- Both me my husband and her work in the same field and now he is obsessed to achieve the similar position title as her and even want to work at a company that shared the same parent company as her company
- She has huge boobs thigh and butt and I'm just petite skinny person. The side supply is a cosplayer and she likes to cosplay as a super sexy character with minimum coverings of her body. If she post a certain cosplay photos with side boobs out and thighs flaunted out, my husband would ignored me for the whole day,not a single word, phone never leave his hand, sleep on the sofa, stay up late watching porn about that and sexting with her. Then the next day or some days later when the side supply is back to work days, unavailable, my husband would 'use' me as the replacement and he'd grope my thighs endlessly, told me to use outfit that showing side boobs, etc. 
-The side supply is a cat lady. I'm a dog person. When me and my husband was still dating, he bragged about how cute his mom's dog is and couldn't wait for us to adopt our own dog. Yes you are right now he is a cat person too. 
- And last example for the highlight, that also marked the moment where I first found out about the side supply. He never bakes anything before. Heck let alone that wretched prick in the kitchen is already ??? The side supply post about how her banana bread is the no.1 in the world, my husband has turned into a pastry chef ever since.

Basically everything always tailored to whatever the side supply is doing or like to do at certain time. Everything else I can handle but this causing me a lot of pain and occupied my mind a lot cause I feel like I am now losing my own identity and someone else interest and identity is forced on me. And it's constant and endless. Even on daily basis. ",1,1748247312.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

Brandon, Manitoba

Stress level: 52%

General Everfox stood before the mirror in her quarters at the Brandon Palace, adjusting the crimson cuffs of her immaculate Royal Mountie uniform with deliberate precision. Her  brimmed hat, freshly brushed, hung from a polished hook, waiting. The polished brass of her saber gleamed in the low morning light. Outside, the wind scraped faintly at the frosted windows, a reminder that spring had failed to thaw the front.

With King Gunn still bound in his chambers, weakened by persistent illness, Astrilla would once again take his chair at the War Council. She wore the authority well. Too well, some whispered but none could deny her command. As she clipped the last button on her tunic, her expression hardened: today‚Äôs session would bring more talk of trenches, frozen lines, and the slow death of momentum. The war had stopped moving. She had not.

Bootheels crisp on the marble floor, General Astrilla Everfox strode through the vaulted halls of Castle Alderwick with the casual confidence of someone long accustomed to walking ahead of others. Aides and junior officers snapped to attention as she passed, though she gave only the faintest nod in return, acknowledgment enough to remind them she‚Äôd noticed, but not enough to suggest interruption was welcome.

Despite the weight of the morning‚Äôs agenda be they reports of stalled offensives, rising desertions, and whispers of dissent within the Eastern Marches she carried herself with practiced ease. Her gloves were tucked under one arm, her gait steady but unhurried. The hum of activity around her, officers exchanging clipped updates and staff scuttling between wings, never broke her pace.

As she reached the threshold of the council chamber, she paused briefly and turned to her adjutant, a wiry lieutenant trying to keep up with her stride. 

*Send word to the kitchens*

 she said, her voice smooth but edged with command. 

*Have them bring a proper breakfast, coffee and tea as well as some warm bread, and don't forget to feed us something that bleeds. If they insist on talking about a war stuck in the mud, they‚Äôll do it with full stomachs.*

The chamber was already alive with murmurs and the rustle of parchment when the doors finally opened once more. All heads turned as General Everfox stepped inside, the last to arrive, her uniform crisp and immaculate as ever. She offered a faint, apologetic smile just enough to imply humility, but not enough to suggest she‚Äôd hurried. 

*My apologies, councilors*

she said lightly, her voice carrying with natural command. 

‚ÄúIt seems even when with the crown time is a rarity.*

 With an effortless grace, she made her way to the king‚Äôs chair, pausing only to smooth her gloves before taking her seat. The room stilled, attention snapping to her like iron to a magnet. She did not need to raise her voice or thump the table. Her presence spoke loudly enough.

*Now ladies and gentlemen shall we begin todays session of the war effort?*

1kvoylx,https://i.redd.it/ora1k2bq233f1.png,"No More Layovers for a Love That Won‚Äôt Land-  Freya, Mr. Whitemore signed off on your resignation papers, but he didn't notice it was you leaving-Got the full version of the story.","Freya, Mr. Whitemore signed off on your resignation papers, but he didn't notice it was you leaving. Want me to let him know?"" The HR director's voice came through the phone, concern evident.  
  
Freya's eyes lowered as she replied softly, ""No need. Just leave it as is.""  
  
""But you've been his right hand for four years! He values you more than anyone and totally depends on you. Are you absolutely sure about quitting?""  
  
HR was practically begging, but Freya just offered a small smile.  
  
""Nobody's irreplaceable in this world. My parents aren't doing well, and I need to head back home to settle down. Since Mr. Whitemore approved it, I'll handle the transition. I'll be gone in a month. Thanks for checking.""  
  
After hanging up, Freya went back to sorting through her things. She'd lived in this penthouse for three years. Not too much stuff, not too little‚Äîjust keeping essentials and tossing the rest.  
  
As the room emptied, she felt momentarily disoriented, memories washing over her like waves.  
  
Eight years ago, Freya‚Äîa small-town girl from a modest family‚Äîgot into Harvard and became best friends with New York heiress Elena Whitemore.  
  
Despite their completely different backgrounds, they clicked instantly‚Äîattending lectures together, grabbing lunch, hitting the shops‚Äîpractically joined at the hip every day.  
  
Gradually, Elena brought Freya into her world, introduced her to family, and unwittingly, Freya fell hard for Elena's brother, Jasper. But she buried those feelings deep, never breathing a word to anyone.  
  
After graduation, Elena took off to study in Paris. Freya stayed in New York, landed a job as Jasper's assistant‚Äîall to be near him.  
  
Then came that night when someone slipped something into Jasper's drink. Freya was about to call 911 when he pinned her against the wall, his control gone as his mouth claimed hers.  
  
After a night together, she woke to find him by the window, his sharp profile haloed in cigarette smoke, brooding and distant.  
  
Hearing her stir, he turned. ""You're into me, aren't you?""  
  
Freya instinctively wanted to deny it, but he continued, his face expressionless.  
  
""You blush whenever I walk in. You know all my likes and dislikes. You jumped at becoming my assistant right after graduation...""  
  
""Don't tell me that's all coincidence.""  
  
His words left her face burning, from embarrassment or guilt, she wasn't sure which.  
  
In the heavy silence, he suddenly handed her a card.  
  
""Last night shouldn't have happened. I'm in love with someone else and can't return your feelings or take responsibility. Elena mentioned you come from a modest background‚Äîthere's enough money on this card to set you up for life. Let's both forget this ever happened.""  
  
Freya was stunned. Then she remembered he'd repeatedly called out a name in bed: Mia. Mia Carter.  
  
From Elena, Freya knew Mia was Jasper's unforgettable first love. He was so hung up on her that even after she dumped him and moved abroad, collecting a string of rumored boyfriends, he insisted on waiting for her return.  
  
Freya recalled Elena's eye-roll: ""The Whitemores are known for being cold fish. How did my brother turn into such a hopeless romantic? Waiting all these years, saying everyone else would be 'settling' because he refuses to settle.""  
  
Feeling this in her bones, Freya suddenly found her courage and called after Jasper as he headed for the door.  
  
""I don't want your money. I just want a chance. Please, just try being with me. If she never comes back or... if she does return but you still can't move on, I'll walk away. I promise.""  
  
Faced with her lovesick gaze, Jasper paused for a beat before muttering, ""Whatever,"" and walking out.  
  
From that day forward, Freya was his assistant by day and his lover by night. They left their mark in his office, his Maybach, against the windows of his penthouse. Four years passed with no one knowing about their arrangement, and she told herself she was happy.  
  
Until his birthday a few days ago. Freya had planned several surprises to celebrate. But as midnight approached, instead of Jasper, she got a notification from his social media‚Äîan account he'd never used before.  
  
""Best birthday gift? Getting back what I lost.""  
  
The forever-silent Jasper Whitemore had posted a photo of himself kissing Mia Carter beneath exploding fireworks.  
  
Seeing this, the blood drained from Freya's face, her chest tightening. With one last desperate hope, she called him.  
  
Mia answered. After saying ""hello"" several times to silence, she called out: ""Jasper, who's this Freya Kingsley calling you and not saying anything?""  
  
A moment later, his deep, cool voice came through the speaker: ""Nobody important. Ignore it. Come back to bed, babe.""  
  
In that moment, Freya knew her exit cue had arrived.  
  
She packed her things, ready to leave, when she ran into Jasper at the door. Since they'd been sleeping together regularly, Freya had been staying at his place for convenience‚Äîbut now, she couldn't stay another night.  
  
Seeing her with her bags, his eyes narrowed slightly, but he made no move to stop her. ""Found a place?""  
  
""Yeah, my old apartment. Talked to the landlord‚Äîjust for a month.""  
  
At this, Jasper frowned. ""A month? What for?""  
  
Freya started to explain, but he seemed to lose interest, merely saying, ""I'll drive you.""  
  
She tried to refuse, but he insisted.  
  
""It's dumping snow out there, and it's late. If anything happened to you, Elena would kill me.""  
  
Freya reluctantly got into his car. Once, they'd been intimate countless times in this vehicle, but now she barely recognized it. The interior was plastered with cute plushies, Hello Kitty seat covers, and snacks everywhere...  
  
She could hardly imagine this serious, standoffish man transforming his car into something so cutesy.  
  
Noticing her stare, Jasper offered a brief explanation: ""Mia's into this stuff.""  
  
Freya got his meaning and stayed quiet for a long while before responding softly.  
  
""You finally got her back. I'm happy for you, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
Jasper hadn't expected that response. His eyes darkened, and he said nothing more.  
  
Halfway to her place, Mia called, wanting to build a snowman with him. He pulled over, clearly eager to go to her, but hesitated when he glanced at Freya.  
  
Understanding his dilemma, Freya opened the door. ""I'll grab a Uber from here, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
He nodded and got out to help with her stuff. Her hands slipped, and the box crashed to the ground. As he bent down, the streetlight illuminated its spilled contents, freezing him in place.  
  
Love letters addressed to him but never sent, candid photos she'd secretly taken, things he'd tossed that she'd rescued and treasured...  
  
Freya's heart hammered as she scrambled to gather everything.  
  
""Sorry about that.""  
  
Without a word, Jasper got back in his car and sped away.  
  
Freya waited in the snow for ages but couldn't get a ride. Trying to lug her box home, she was hit by an electric scooter.  
  
The collision left a nasty gash on her calf, blood staining the snow. Watching the hit-and-run driver disappear, she gasped with pain, lying in the snow for what felt like forever.  
  
When she could finally move, she limped through the snow for four hours before reaching her apartment.  
  
After patching up her wound, she checked her phone to find a message from Jasper, sent after he'd left:  
  
\[Stop being so obsessed with one guy. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Don't hang all your hopes on me.\]  
  
Freya stared at this message for a very long time.  
  
At dawn, she went downstairs, set fire to the box, and burned everything inside it. The love that had burned fiercely in her heart for eight years turned to ashes alongside those mementos.  
  
Jasper Whitemore, I'll grant your wish.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After a quiet weekend, Monday morning rolled around, and Freya arrived at work on schedule.  
  
She handled her usual tasks, including notifying Jasper about his upcoming meeting. Approaching his office, she glanced through the partially open door and stopped cold.  
  
Mia was sitting in Jasper's lap, feeding him the other half of her cookie. The famously germaphobic CEO actually ate it with a smile, then gently kissed her fingertips.  
  
""You were talking about craving these yesterday, so I stood in line for three hours this morning. Worth it?"" His voice had a tenderness Freya had never heard before.  
  
""Mmm, they're perfect‚Äîsweet but not sickeningly so. You used to trek across town for these all the time. Now you're literally running a corporation. Can't you just send someone to get them?"" Mia wiggled her foot as he massaged her ankle.  
  
The look on Jasper's face was pure devotion. ""Anything that matters to you, I handle myself. Always.""  
  
Mia's face lit up as she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. He pulled her closer, completely lost in the moment.  
  
Watching them, Freya felt like she'd been punched in the chest, a bitter ache spreading through her. Her fingernails dug deep into her palms, leaving bloody crescents behind.  
  
As the meeting time approached, Freya composed herself and knocked lightly.  
  
""Mr. Whitemore, your meeting's about to start.""  
  
Hearing her, Jasper tensed slightly and started to rise, but Mia tugged him back down.  
  
""Don't go yet. Five more minutes?"" She gave him puppy-dog eyes.  
  
Her playful plea melted his resolve instantly.  
  
""Push the meeting back two hours,"" he called out.  
  
This meeting involved a collaboration between major New York corporations that was crucial to the company's future. Freya knew its importance and couldn't help adding:  
  
""The CEOs from Verdean, Aurex, and Vireon are already in the conference room...""  
  
""God, Jasper, your assistant is such a buzzkill! Can't she take a hint?"" Mia rolled her eyes dramatically.  
  
Jasper's expression hardened instantly. ""I said postpone it two hours. Nothing comes before Mia, got it?""  
  
Freya felt like she couldn't breathe. In the end, she simply closed the door and walked away.  
  
Everyone in their circle knew Jasper was a workaholic machine. No matter what was happening personally‚Äîeven right after surgery‚Äîhe'd drag himself in to finish his work.  
  
Yet here he was, risking relationships with major partners because of a little whining. This was completely new territory.  
  
Did he really love Mia that much?  
  
Freya pulled herself together and walked into the conference room to face the waiting executives.  
  
The Whitemore empire was powerful enough that these CEOs, despite being pissed, wouldn't directly criticize Jasper. Instead, they unloaded on Freya.  
  
She took their verbal abuse silently, head down.  
  
After an excruciating two-hour wait, Jasper finally showed up. As Freya left the conference room on legs that felt like jelly, Mia called out to her.  
  
""You're Freya, right? Jasper says you make killer coffee. Everyone looks dead on their feet‚Äîwhip up some for the whole floor? Mine with ice, no sugar.""  
  
Knowing her place in the hierarchy, Freya headed to the break room without protest.  
  
Two hours later, she finished preparing over four hundred cups, delivering them one by one.  
  
After just one sip, Mia's face darkened. She hurled her mug straight at Freya's head.  
  
The ceramic smashed against Freya's forehead, opening a nasty gash. She let out a gasp of pain and dropped to the floor, clutching her wound.  
  
Not satisfied, Mia grabbed more mugs and kept throwing them.  
  
Bruises bloomed across Freya's body as ceramic shards sliced her skin. Coffee soaked through her clothes, mixing with bright red blood dripping onto the floor.  
  
Despite the blinding pain, she could only curl into a ball, protecting her head and chest.  
  
The office went dead silent. Nobody dared step in as Mia continued her meltdown. They all kept their distance, watching in horror.  
  
The commotion brought Jasper out of his office. He surveyed the chaos and Freya's crumpled form with narrowed eyes.  
  
""What the hell happened?""  
  
Seeing him, Mia instantly switched to victim mode. ""Jasper, I asked her to make me coffee. I'm on my period, and she deliberately put ice in it. My cramps are killing me now.""  
  
Seeing her teary eyes, Jasper's face darkened immediately.  
  
""You've worked for me for four years and can't handle a simple coffee order? Or do you have some problem with Mia?""  
  
Freya raised her deathly pale face to explain, but he didn't give her the chance. He called over another assistant.  
  
""Dock her entire month's salary and quarterly bonus. Send a company-wide notice and have her make a public apology at next week's all-hands.""  
  
With that, Jasper draped his jacket over Mia's shoulders and led her away.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
As Jasper vanished down the corridor, the tears Freya had been fighting finally broke free.  
  
She forced herself up, wincing as she grabbed a broom and mop to tackle the mess of shattered ceramic and coffee.  
  
A few sympathetic coworkers came to help, their eyes full of pity.  
  
""I clearly heard her say 'with ice, no sugar.' How's she flipping this on you? Did you tick her off somehow?"" one whispered.  
  
""Like she needs a reason?"" another muttered. ""Everyone knows she's a total princess. Throws a fit over nothing. Half our circle can't stand her, but with Jasper in her pocket, nobody dares say boo.""  
  
""Man, I've never seen him this crazy about anyone. Freya, just watch your back. We're regular folks‚Äîwe can't compete with trust fund babies. With Jasper backing her play, we just have to eat whatever crap they serve us.""  
  
Freya appreciated their support, but their words left her emotionally tangled.  
  
Once, when a client tried blaming her for their own mistake on a contract, Jasper had stood rock-solid behind her. He'd believed in her completely, fighting until her name was cleared.  
  
But now? Mia drops one casual lie, and he doesn't even fact-check or let her explain. He just assumes she's at fault.  
  
After years of dedication, handling countless fires for him‚Äîdidn't she deserve that basic trust?  
  
Or in his world, did right and wrong not matter as long as Mia was happy?  
  
The thought left her heart feeling like raw hamburger.  
  
It took forever to clean everything before dragging her battered body home.  
  
She had barely stepped out of the shower when her phone lit up with Jasper's name.  
  
""Bring over some Advil and heating pads.""  
  
She threw everything together ASAP and headed to his penthouse.  
  
In just days, the once sleek space had transformed completely. The cherry tree his grandfather planted‚Äîgone, replaced by tulips. The black and white furniture he'd always preferred‚Äîswapped for pink and yellow pieces he used to mock. Display cases now showcased jewelry, designer bags, and gifts...  
  
Pure Mia, through and through.  
  
Freya took it all in silently before knocking on the bedroom door.  
  
Jasper opened it, grabbed the stuff, and finally glanced at her face.  
  
With the coffee cleaned off, her injuries looked brutal, making him pause.  
  
""Jesus. Have you had that checked out?""  
  
Freya just shook her head.  
  
He rubbed his temple, his tone softening slightly.  
  
""Look, Mia was just feeling like garbage. She wasn't gunning for you specifically, so don't take it personally. I'll add what I docked from your pay to your Christmas bonus. Get those wounds looked at‚Äîif they're bad, take a few sick days. I'll sign off on it, no red tape.""  
  
""That won't be necessary. At the end of this month‚Äî""  
  
Freya tried telling him about her resignation, but he cut her off, shoving a card into her hand.  
  
""Just do what I'm telling you. I need you to put together a welcome-back thing for Mia, so rest up and heal.""  
  
The words died in Freya's throat.  
  
She nodded, took the card, and turned to leave.  
  
As the door swung shut, she caught Mia's voice:  
  
""Babe, is that tea ready? Can you come rub my stomach?""  
  
""Coming right now. Just lie still and don't move, okay?""  
  
Hearing his tender tone, Freya smiled bitterly.  
  
Her own cramps were brutal too‚Äîshe'd actually passed out at work multiple times and been rushed to the ER.  
  
When he found out? Just a signed time-off form. No visits, no tea, no heating pads.  
  
Back then, she'd told herself he was swamped with work.  
  
Now she got it‚Äîhe just didn't give a damn.  
  
After leaving, Freya hit up urgent care for basic treatment.  
  
She crashed at home for a few days before getting bombarded with party specs from his assistant.  
  
Everything from floral arrangements to dessert selections to server uniforms came with ridiculous requirements.  
  
With just three days to pull it off, Freya pushed through her exhaustion to make it happen.  
  
After running herself ragged, the party kicked off at 7 PM sharp.  
  
Mia floated in wearing some couture masterpiece, immediately becoming the room's center of gravity.  
  
Guests swarmed her with compliments, feeding her ego.  
  
""It's been ages, but you're still that same knockout, Mia. Even a 'casual' welcome-back party looks like the Met Gala‚Äîclearly Jasper's still completely whipped!""  
  
""Remember college when some poor schmuck asked Mia out? Jasper literally got the guy transferred! He shredded love letters on sight, and when people talked smack about Mia, he put those dudes in the hospital!""

I had such a great time with my wonderful family. However, I did feel a bit lonely at times, so I‚Äôm looking forward to meeting some new people.

- 33, female, living in NYC
- I love iced coffee, drinking champagne from the bottle, and eating way too much breakfast. God, I love brunch! I enjoy talking on the phone and sending cards because I saw a cute one. I‚Äôm totally ridiculous, and you either love me or hate me.
- I am very passionate about books, having read a total of 90 this year.
- I love to dance and sing; I am into Sam Fender and Ella Fitzgerald, so I have a very broad range.
- I would like to connect with someone who lives in the United States.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm not into:
I am not interested in video games. While you can play them and talk to me about it, I‚Äôm not going to know what you‚Äôre talking about. Unless we meet in person and you can show me how to play sometime, it probably won‚Äôt work if you are a hardcore gamer.
- I don‚Äôt care about hunting, fishing, or camping. My motto is, ""My idea of camping is a hotel with room service."" I love taking walks, though; I prefer to come home after two hours and live my life.",2,1748246561.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

ich bin ein Mann (bitte hasst mich nicht ich mag Frauen :D) und gerade dabei, meine erste eigene Kaffeemarke zu starten ‚Äì und bevor ich wirklich an den Start gehe, m√∂chte ich bewusst eure Meinung dazu h√∂ren.

Die Idee klingt erstmal ungew√∂hnlich: Kaffee mit Fruchtaroma.  
Keine Instant-Mischung, kein Sirup, sondern echte Kaffeebohnen, die nach dem R√∂sten mit nat√ºrlichen Aromen wie Erdbeere, Blaubeere, Kokos oder Orange veredelt werden.  
Zuckerfrei, vegan, hei√ü oder kalt trinkbar ‚Äì und der Fruchtgeschmack ist eher subtil im Nachgang, nicht k√ºnstlich oder s√º√ü.

Die Bohnen sind 50‚ÄØ% Robusta / 50‚ÄØ% Arabica aus Brasilien und werden in √ñsterreich handger√∂stet. Der Fokus liegt auf einem besonderen Geschmackserlebnis ‚Äì nicht auf High-End Specialty Coffee, sondern etwas Neues, das neugierig machen soll.

Ich bin nat√ºrlich schon selbst sehr in meiner Idee drin ‚Äì deshalb ist mir euer ehrliches Feedback so wichtig, gerade aus weiblicher Sicht:

‚Äì W√ºrdet ihr sowas probieren?  
‚Äì Frucht im Kaffee ‚Äì totaler Quatsch oder interessante Idee?  
‚Äì Gibt‚Äôs Sorten, die ihr spannend f√§ndet?  
‚Äì Was w√§re f√ºr euch ein No-Go (Design, Verpackung, Inhaltsstoffe etc.)?

Ich will hier niemanden zuspammen ‚Äì wenn jemand neugierig ist, kann ich gerne den Link zur Launch-Seite dalassen (aber nur auf Nachfrage!).

I've watched videos, tried to compare daphnia to cyclops to... all the things, and I'm just not sure. I'm not stressing too much about having them, I'd just really really like to identify what they are. They do often appear to skip but in this video you can see them being less skippy as many gathered on the glass when I temporarily turned off my filter that has decent flow. They are all pretty much the same size when I see them and very little. They are absolutely in/on all plants, cholla wood, and filter sponges. I have them in every vessel and I did a lot of aquarium plant gardening today and turned my filter off to see if I'd see any in this tank, and they had a party in this corner- usually I don't see this many. I don't have many pets that will eat them ATM although one tank now has some teeny clown killifish so hopefully they will have free snacks. I have a neon tetra and he doesn't even seem to notice these things or he's like, they have to be my school until I have more of me again, idk, but he has no interest. 
My few wet pets are not overfed, I do water changes weekly, and I vacuum/turkey baste the substrate although this tank is sand. I think they have plant matter to consume and do just dandy with that and yesterday I popped a sponge filter I keep seeded in this tank back in from a quarantine tank and I KNOW I then saw one in there so prob had a bunch in/on the sponge. 
I sterilize plants to the best of my ability with either alum or reverse respiration but not surprised these things would find a way to survive, so I don't know if they came with plants or on the net with some ghost shrimp which is the first time I recall seeing one skip by, although not in this tank. They are even in my moss and subwassertang jars now too even though I've been trying to not spread them with tools I use. Matter of time before they are in my morning coffee- help ID them for me just so I know what they are? ",1,1748246454.0,Aquariums,0,1.0,False

I found out she been stealing my ideas then Tweaking it a bit then presented as hers!!!
The only reason I can think of her being this disrespectful is really because she is threatened by me. 
in less than a year starting in her dept I made so much progress and I‚Äôve made really good relations with her peers.
So I thought I needed her to really reflect on her actions to understand how hurtful she is. So thought to do a mirror spell. 

So on sat, I added a petition inside a pocket mirror with a blend of bend over oil mixed with devil shoestring oil and ground coffee, all of that inside a small mirror. Wrapped the whole thing inside a black bin bag then added aluminium foil around it and tucked in a dark place in my room.

I‚Äôm having fever!!! Shivers with cold hands and not to mention things were going wired this morning, like mundane things as my new password wasn‚Äôt working, making small errors here and there, which I never ever make.

1kvovmi,https://i.redd.it/n8lwakhq133f1.png,No More Layovers for a Love That Won‚Äôt Land,"Freya, Mr. Whitemore signed off on your resignation papers, but he didn't notice it was you leaving. Want me to let him know?"" The HR director's voice came through the phone, concern evident.



Freya's eyes lowered as she replied softly, ""No need. Just leave it as is.""



""But you've been his right hand for four years! He values you more than anyone and totally depends on you. Are you absolutely sure about quitting?""



HR was practically begging, but Freya just offered a small smile.



""Nobody's irreplaceable in this world. My parents aren't doing well, and I need to head back home to settle down. Since Mr. Whitemore approved it, I'll handle the transition. I'll be gone in a month. Thanks for checking.""



After hanging up, Freya went back to sorting through her things. She'd lived in this penthouse for three years. Not too much stuff, not too little‚Äîjust keeping essentials and tossing the rest.



As the room emptied, she felt momentarily disoriented, memories washing over her like waves.



Eight years ago, Freya‚Äîa small-town girl from a modest family‚Äîgot into Harvard and became best friends with New York heiress Elena Whitemore.



Despite their completely different backgrounds, they clicked instantly‚Äîattending lectures together, grabbing lunch, hitting the shops‚Äîpractically joined at the hip every day.



Gradually, Elena brought Freya into her world, introduced her to family, and unwittingly, Freya fell hard for Elena's brother, Jasper. But she buried those feelings deep, never breathing a word to anyone.



After graduation, Elena took off to study in Paris. Freya stayed in New York, landed a job as Jasper's assistant‚Äîall to be near him.



Then came that night when someone slipped something into Jasper's drink. Freya was about to call 911 when he pinned her against the wall, his control gone as his mouth claimed hers.



After a night together, she woke to find him by the window, his sharp profile haloed in cigarette smoke, brooding and distant.



Hearing her stir, he turned. ""You're into me, aren't you?""



Freya instinctively wanted to deny it, but he continued, his face expressionless.



""You blush whenever I walk in. You know all my likes and dislikes. You jumped at becoming my assistant right after graduation...""



""Don't tell me that's all coincidence.""



His words left her face burning, from embarrassment or guilt, she wasn't sure which.



In the heavy silence, he suddenly handed her a card.



""Last night shouldn't have happened. I'm in love with someone else and can't return your feelings or take responsibility. Elena mentioned you come from a modest background‚Äîthere's enough money on this card to set you up for life. Let's both forget this ever happened.""



Freya was stunned. Then she remembered he'd repeatedly called out a name in bed: Mia. Mia Carter.



From Elena, Freya knew Mia was Jasper's unforgettable first love. He was so hung up on her that even after she dumped him and moved abroad, collecting a string of rumored boyfriends, he insisted on waiting for her return.



Freya recalled Elena's eye-roll: ""The Whitemores are known for being cold fish. How did my brother turn into such a hopeless romantic? Waiting all these years, saying everyone else would be 'settling' because he refuses to settle.""



Feeling this in her bones, Freya suddenly found her courage and called after Jasper as he headed for the door.



""I don't want your money. I just want a chance. Please, just try being with me. If she never comes back or... if she does return but you still can't move on, I'll walk away. I promise.""



Faced with her lovesick gaze, Jasper paused for a beat before muttering, ""Whatever,"" and walking out.



From that day forward, Freya was his assistant by day and his lover by night. They left their mark in his office, his Maybach, against the windows of his penthouse. Four years passed with no one knowing about their arrangement, and she told herself she was happy.



Until his birthday a few days ago. Freya had planned several surprises to celebrate. But as midnight approached, instead of Jasper, she got a notification from his social media‚Äîan account he'd never used before.



""Best birthday gift? Getting back what I lost.""



The forever-silent Jasper Whitemore had posted a photo of himself kissing Mia Carter beneath exploding fireworks.



Seeing this, the blood drained from Freya's face, her chest tightening. With one last desperate hope, she called him.



Mia answered. After saying ""hello"" several times to silence, she called out: ""Jasper, who's this Freya Kingsley calling you and not saying anything?""



A moment later, his deep, cool voice came through the speaker: ""Nobody important. Ignore it. Come back to bed, babe.""



In that moment, Freya knew her exit cue had arrived.



She packed her things, ready to leave, when she ran into Jasper at the door. Since they'd been sleeping together regularly, Freya had been staying at his place for convenience‚Äîbut now, she couldn't stay another night.



Seeing her with her bags, his eyes narrowed slightly, but he made no move to stop her. ""Found a place?""



""Yeah, my old apartment. Talked to the landlord‚Äîjust for a month.""



At this, Jasper frowned. ""A month? What for?""



Freya started to explain, but he seemed to lose interest, merely saying, ""I'll drive you.""



She tried to refuse, but he insisted.



""It's dumping snow out there, and it's late. If anything happened to you, Elena would kill me.""



Freya reluctantly got into his car. Once, they'd been intimate countless times in this vehicle, but now she barely recognized it. The interior was plastered with cute plushies, Hello Kitty seat covers, and snacks everywhere...



She could hardly imagine this serious, standoffish man transforming his car into something so cutesy.



Noticing her stare, Jasper offered a brief explanation: ""Mia's into this stuff.""



Freya got his meaning and stayed quiet for a long while before responding softly.



""You finally got her back. I'm happy for you, Mr. Whitemore.""



Jasper hadn't expected that response. His eyes darkened, and he said nothing more.



Halfway to her place, Mia called, wanting to build a snowman with him. He pulled over, clearly eager to go to her, but hesitated when he glanced at Freya.



Understanding his dilemma, Freya opened the door. ""I'll grab a Uber from here, Mr. Whitemore.""



He nodded and got out to help with her stuff. Her hands slipped, and the box crashed to the ground. As he bent down, the streetlight illuminated its spilled contents, freezing him in place.



Love letters addressed to him but never sent, candid photos she'd secretly taken, things he'd tossed that she'd rescued and treasured...



Freya's heart hammered as she scrambled to gather everything.



""Sorry about that.""



Without a word, Jasper got back in his car and sped away.



Freya waited in the snow for ages but couldn't get a ride. Trying to lug her box home, she was hit by an electric scooter.



The collision left a nasty gash on her calf, blood staining the snow. Watching the hit-and-run driver disappear, she gasped with pain, lying in the snow for what felt like forever.



When she could finally move, she limped through the snow for four hours before reaching her apartment.



After patching up her wound, she checked her phone to find a message from Jasper, sent after he'd left:



\[Stop being so obsessed with one guy. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Don't hang all your hopes on me.\]



Freya stared at this message for a very long time.



At dawn, she went downstairs, set fire to the box, and burned everything inside it. The love that had burned fiercely in her heart for eight years turned to ashes alongside those mementos.



Jasper Whitemore, I'll grant your wish.



Chapter 2



After a quiet weekend, Monday morning rolled around, and Freya arrived at work on schedule.



She handled her usual tasks, including notifying Jasper about his upcoming meeting. Approaching his office, she glanced through the partially open door and stopped cold.



Mia was sitting in Jasper's lap, feeding him the other half of her cookie. The famously germaphobic CEO actually ate it with a smile, then gently kissed her fingertips.



""You were talking about craving these yesterday, so I stood in line for three hours this morning. Worth it?"" His voice had a tenderness Freya had never heard before.



""Mmm, they're perfect‚Äîsweet but not sickeningly so. You used to trek across town for these all the time. Now you're literally running a corporation. Can't you just send someone to get them?"" Mia wiggled her foot as he massaged her ankle.



The look on Jasper's face was pure devotion. ""Anything that matters to you, I handle myself. Always.""



Mia's face lit up as she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. He pulled her closer, completely lost in the moment.



Watching them, Freya felt like she'd been punched in the chest, a bitter ache spreading through her. Her fingernails dug deep into her palms, leaving bloody crescents behind.



As the meeting time approached, Freya composed herself and knocked lightly.



""Mr. Whitemore, your meeting's about to start.""



Hearing her, Jasper tensed slightly and started to rise, but Mia tugged him back down.



""Don't go yet. Five more minutes?"" She gave him puppy-dog eyes.



Her playful plea melted his resolve instantly.



""Push the meeting back two hours,"" he called out.



This meeting involved a collaboration between major New York corporations that was crucial to the company's future. Freya knew its importance and couldn't help adding:



""The CEOs from Verdean, Aurex, and Vireon are already in the conference room...""



""God, Jasper, your assistant is such a buzzkill! Can't she take a hint?"" Mia rolled her eyes dramatically.



Jasper's expression hardened instantly. ""I said postpone it two hours. Nothing comes before Mia, got it?""



Freya felt like she couldn't breathe. In the end, she simply closed the door and walked away.



Everyone in their circle knew Jasper was a workaholic machine. No matter what was happening personally‚Äîeven right after surgery‚Äîhe'd drag himself in to finish his work.



Yet here he was, risking relationships with major partners because of a little whining. This was completely new territory.



Did he really love Mia that much?



Freya pulled herself together and walked into the conference room to face the waiting executives.



The Whitemore empire was powerful enough that these CEOs, despite being pissed, wouldn't directly criticize Jasper. Instead, they unloaded on Freya.



She took their verbal abuse silently, head down.



After an excruciating two-hour wait, Jasper finally showed up. As Freya left the conference room on legs that felt like jelly, Mia called out to her.



""You're Freya, right? Jasper says you make killer coffee. Everyone looks dead on their feet‚Äîwhip up some for the whole floor? Mine with ice, no sugar.""



Knowing her place in the hierarchy, Freya headed to the break room without protest.



Two hours later, she finished preparing over four hundred cups, delivering them one by one.



After just one sip, Mia's face darkened. She hurled her mug straight at Freya's head.



The ceramic smashed against Freya's forehead, opening a nasty gash. She let out a gasp of pain and dropped to the floor, clutching her wound.



Not satisfied, Mia grabbed more mugs and kept throwing them.



Bruises bloomed across Freya's body as ceramic shards sliced her skin. Coffee soaked through her clothes, mixing with bright red blood dripping onto the floor.



Despite the blinding pain, she could only curl into a ball, protecting her head and chest.



The office went dead silent. Nobody dared step in as Mia continued her meltdown. They all kept their distance, watching in horror.



The commotion brought Jasper out of his office. He surveyed the chaos and Freya's crumpled form with narrowed eyes.



""What the hell happened?""



Seeing him, Mia instantly switched to victim mode. ""Jasper, I asked her to make me coffee. I'm on my period, and she deliberately put ice in it. My cramps are killing me now.""



Seeing her teary eyes, Jasper's face darkened immediately.



""You've worked for me for four years and can't handle a simple coffee order? Or do you have some problem with Mia?""



Freya raised her deathly pale face to explain, but he didn't give her the chance. He called over another assistant.



""Dock her entire month's salary and quarterly bonus. Send a company-wide notice and have her make a public apology at next week's all-hands.""



With that, Jasper draped his jacket over Mia's shoulders and led her away.



Chapter 3



As Jasper vanished down the corridor, the tears Freya had been fighting finally broke free.



She forced herself up, wincing as she grabbed a broom and mop to tackle the mess of shattered ceramic and coffee.



A few sympathetic coworkers came to help, their eyes full of pity.



""I clearly heard her say 'with ice, no sugar.' How's she flipping this on you? Did you tick her off somehow?"" one whispered.



""Like she needs a reason?"" another muttered. ""Everyone knows she's a total princess. Throws a fit over nothing. Half our circle can't stand her, but with Jasper in her pocket, nobody dares say boo.""



""Man, I've never seen him this crazy about anyone. Freya, just watch your back. We're regular folks‚Äîwe can't compete with trust fund babies. With Jasper backing her play, we just have to eat whatever crap they serve us.""



Freya appreciated their support, but their words left her emotionally tangled.



Once, when a client tried blaming her for their own mistake on a contract, Jasper had stood rock-solid behind her. He'd believed in her completely, fighting until her name was cleared.



But now? Mia drops one casual lie, and he doesn't even fact-check or let her explain. He just assumes she's at fault.



After years of dedication, handling countless fires for him‚Äîdidn't she deserve that basic trust?



Or in his world, did right and wrong not matter as long as Mia was happy?



The thought left her heart feeling like raw hamburger.



It took forever to clean everything before dragging her battered body home.



She had barely stepped out of the shower when her phone lit up with Jasper's name.



""Bring over some Advil and heating pads.""



She threw everything together ASAP and headed to his penthouse.



In just days, the once sleek space had transformed completely. The cherry tree his grandfather planted‚Äîgone, replaced by tulips. The black and white furniture he'd always preferred‚Äîswapped for pink and yellow pieces he used to mock. Display cases now showcased jewelry, designer bags, and gifts...



Pure Mia, through and through.



Freya took it all in silently before knocking on the bedroom door.



Jasper opened it, grabbed the stuff, and finally glanced at her face.



With the coffee cleaned off, her injuries looked brutal, making him pause.



""Jesus. Have you had that checked out?""



Freya just shook her head.



He rubbed his temple, his tone softening slightly.



""Look, Mia was just feeling like garbage. She wasn't gunning for you specifically, so don't take it personally. I'll add what I docked from your pay to your Christmas bonus. Get those wounds looked at‚Äîif they're bad, take a few sick days. I'll sign off on it, no red tape.""



""That won't be necessary. At the end of this month‚Äî""



Freya tried telling him about her resignation, but he cut her off, shoving a card into her hand.



""Just do what I'm telling you. I need you to put together a welcome-back thing for Mia, so rest up and heal.""



The words died in Freya's throat.



She nodded, took the card, and turned to leave.



As the door swung shut, she caught Mia's voice:



""Babe, is that tea ready? Can you come rub my stomach?""



""Coming right now. Just lie still and don't move, okay?""



Hearing his tender tone, Freya smiled bitterly.



Her own cramps were brutal too‚Äîshe'd actually passed out at work multiple times and been rushed to the ER.



When he found out? Just a signed time-off form. No visits, no tea, no heating pads.



Back then, she'd told herself he was swamped with work.



Now she got it‚Äîhe just didn't give a damn.



After leaving, Freya hit up urgent care for basic treatment.



She crashed at home for a few days before getting bombarded with party specs from his assistant.



Everything from floral arrangements to dessert selections to server uniforms came with ridiculous requirements.



With just three days to pull it off, Freya pushed through her exhaustion to make it happen.



After running herself ragged, the party kicked off at 7 PM sharp.



Mia floated in wearing some couture masterpiece, immediately becoming the room's center of gravity.



Guests swarmed her with compliments, feeding her ego.



""It's been ages, but you're still that same knockout, Mia. Even a 'casual' welcome-back party looks like the Met Gala‚Äîclearly Jasper's still completely whipped!""



""Remember college when some poor schmuck asked Mia out? Jasper literally got the guy transferred! He shredded love letters on sight, and when people talked smack about Mia, he put those dudes in the hospital!""



""Everyone knows Mia's his kryptonite‚Äîthe one he can't resist! Look at that ice she's wearing‚Äîgotta be worth a couple million! And that dress is one-of-a-kind. Jasper's always been 'price is no object' when it comes to keeping Mia happy!""

For example, last winter my room was so cold, I cold see my breath. So I normally keep my windows open for some fresh, cool air in the summer time. My room is directly above the carport, where their door leads out into. 

For some context, where I live, weed is legal. And he smokes weed to help with his anxiety. I do not hate weed. I will have a gummy very couple of months to a year. I have anxiety and depression so I understand. However, since I have asthma and god nerfed my lungs since day one, smoking is not my favourite thing. I have relatives that smoke, and I don‚Äôt police them. I do not care that he smokes. 

You know what I do care about? Him smoking outside my window! I can‚Äôt fricken sleep or breathe thanks to him. I have asked politely to move somewhere else to smoke, to not do it under my window, but he ignores me every time. I asked my sister, and she said, ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt smoke anymore.‚Äù You know why I know that‚Äôs bull? Because I can hear him sometimes talking or letting the dogs out, and then the stench of weed to burn my eyes and close up my throat.

I‚Äôm so tired. I‚Äôm about to scream.

He doesn‚Äôt listen to me when I ask him to do little things that aren‚Äôt hard. Like to let us know when he brings the dog up so my cats are scared shitless. Or to fill up the water in the coffee maker. But I don‚Äôt care because I can deal with those. I just want to sleep without having an asthma attack man. Or my room smelling like weed.

1kvorrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/OneTruthPrevails/comments/1kvorrg/shinichi_and_shihos_childhood_encounter_theory/,Shinichi and Shiho's childhood encounter: Theory from Chinese CoAi analysis community,"Seeing the discussion in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/OneTruthPrevails/comments/1koxbvl/the\_coai\_ending\_possibility\_discussion\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OneTruthPrevails/comments/1koxbvl/the_coai_ending_possibility_discussion_from/) motivated me to share what I believe to be the crown jewel of chinese CoAi deduction(/delusion): the theory that Shinichi and Shiho met before Shinichi met Ran.



**Possible time and place for this encounter**  


The first thing to consider is, is there any evidence that Shiho was in the same geographical area as Shinichi in her childhood? We actually have that evidence: in the Miyano Akemi time capsule case, we see that 13 years ago Akemi shows her Teitan elementary classmates a picture of Shiho, from winter break.

https://preview.redd.it/gxq1prh8q23f1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=40c0ac5403036b157be57ee91d3740ee8310a75c

If Shinichi met Shiho at this time, it would put the meeting right before Shinichi met Ran in kindergarten, also 13 years ago.

  
**Evidence: the star and the cherry blossom theory**



[From July 29th Aoyama's animal crossing promotional hints](https://preview.redd.it/kidd6e9ds23f1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=13e74855c7055a9991fd60cc40ceea9e4ba7f93d)



The star and the cherry blossom theory is simply that the star represents Haibara and the cherry blossom represents Ran. How this theory provides evidence for Shinichi and Shiho's childhood encounter will be expanded on later.



Apart from the animal crossing image above, and Ran and Shinichi first meeting in the sakura classroom, we can find more associations between stars and Haibara. In the special ***Detective Conan Episode ""ONE"" - The Great Detective Turned Small***, Shiho is shown pouring coffee from chemical containers. In the Haibara Ai Secret Archives, the anime director confirmed that this is a reference to the book Inherit the Stars.



https://preview.redd.it/53w8m6apu23f1.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=c303c4d78aa8f894b9fb7d46c47ab2c26ec2240e

  
Reversing the characters in Shiho results in hoshi, which is star in Japanese. Reversing the characters in Miyano gives no yami. Hoshi no yami, or the star's darkness, may be the origin of the name Shiho Miyano (alternatively, yami no hoshi, the star of the darkness, maybe could work too).

  
What is the point of this theory? Well, we see certain interesting depictions of stars and cherry blossoms in the manga. First, we can consider the cover page of chapter 791: Do You Not Remember?



https://preview.redd.it/d2pg4bu5w23f1.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=38cd36d26bac53848cee4e28cfdf3a63cec7fc24

This chapter features Chiba struggling to remember Miike, his childhood friend from 13 years ago. Zooming in on the police hat blowing in the wind, we see that at the top there are 2 stars. What is interesting about that is that the police hat should display cherry blossoms, not stars. The cover of the following chapter has a police hat which is drawn correctly:



[Miike's hat clearly contains sakura flowers on the cover of this chapter](https://preview.redd.it/ondpc52cx23f1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=1114d92cc7e7fb18f6b68b44fc175aff2b90036a)

  
Is it simply Aoyama's mistake? So far, I've tried to pay attention to police hats in rereads, and I have not found the same mistake anywhere else. Isn't it too much of a coincidence, that this mistake occurred specifically in a chapter about a man who has possibly forgotten his friend from 13 years ago?

  
In the Sakura Classroom case, we see that Shinichi deduces that Ran is folding a cherry blossom because he has already seen his father fold a star:



https://preview.redd.it/jcv3h4lby23f1.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=15c37b9c60be932743215d41cea52ef309fd8967

Another meaningless coincidence? Or is Aoyama trying to tell us, that the star comes before the cherry blossom?

  
**Miscellaneous pieces of evidence**

  
When Shinichi confronts the teacher, Efune, he says the following:



https://preview.redd.it/f1pu5lbsy23f1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=f20e74ba41994b6f05e4423f94a39fc651861b05



Checking with my Japanese friend, since the Chinese translation differs a lot from this, a more accurate translation seems to be: You're trying to make her your underling for nefarious purposes!

  
Why would Shinichi think that the teacher was trying to do that? Perhaps, he had already experienced Shiho being forced to study in America by the BO, so that she can become their scientist.

  
Another interesting panel to consider from this case:



https://preview.redd.it/32x5o9ujz23f1.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=96d90bfd3a7cc272e1da5435563dc5750e0d965e

  
In the raw, we see that actually this statement ends in a question mark:



https://preview.redd.it/3vf6m4muz23f1.png?width=522&format=png&auto=webp&s=9152a4db65da89f748054020eca2211be41dd3be

  
So is it really his first heart racing deduction?

  
Let me know if you guys want to hear any more of the evidence the Chinese CoAi analysis community has gathered for this theory, whether you think it's believable or just because you want to laugh more at the copium from us deluded CoAi fans haha.",0,1748245862.0,OneTruthPrevails,2,0.29,False

I still have one last bit to figure out, but the rest is there. You can see my progress yourselves:

## The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything 

Which of the following is the correct reason and purpose for the existence of Life, the Universe, and Everything?
1. To give all creatures the chance to do good;
2. There is no reason or purpose;
3. It was a prank gone horribly wrong;
4. It was a prank gone horribly right;
5. God desired to have an apartment in the lower world;
6. To bring forth beauty;
7. As an answer to ‚ÄúTo be, or not to be‚Äù;
8. As a cosmic art project;
9. To cultivate empathy;
10. Life, the Universe, and Everything is actually the matrix of a super duper computer built to run an octodecillion-year-long program to calculate a different Ultimate Question from a reality we can‚Äôt even begin to comprehend;
11. To make coffee possible;
12. To discover what happens next;
13. Why not?
14. For the delicious irony of fleeting existence;
15. To give gravity something to do;
16. For reality to have an audience;
17. For YOU to exist;
18. To demonstrate the elegance of physical laws;
19. How much is six times seven;
20. For the sheer fun of it, from a cosmic perspective.
21. To offer challenges and growth;
22. As a canvas for free will;
23. To provide a contrast to nothingness;
24. To create the ultimate reality TV show;
25. God just wanted it;
26. So that someone, somewhere, can say ""Well, that escalated quickly"";
27. To be the universe's way of feeling, dreaming, and loving;
28. To experience every possible permutation of existence;
29. It‚Äôs all just a byproduct of quantum physics;
30. To generate enough data to crash a celestial hard drive;
31. As a grand experiment in thermodynamics;
32. To justify the existence of cosmic bureaucracy;
33. To test the limits of patience for an omnipotent being;
34. It's a placeholder until the real universe is ready;
35. So that existential dread can have a home;
36. To create the perfect cosmic joke;
37. As a cosmic ""loading screen"" before the next big thing;
38. To demonstrate the ultimate futility of trying to find the ultimate meaning;
39. To find patterns, create meaning, and strive for understanding;
40. Our senses are completely misinterpreting reality, which, experienced from the right perspective, is actually a grand musical score;
41. For us to ultimately decide our own purpose within the grand scheme of things;
42.

1kvonv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/1kvonv5/before_you_apply_for_ai_data_labelling_jobs_read/,Before You Apply for AI Data Labelling Jobs - Read This!,"If you‚Äôre applying for remote work-from-home jobs like data annotation on platforms such as DA or Outlier, it's important to take the initial assessment seriously. This is a competitive space, with thousands of applicants daily, so standing out is essential. Read all instructions carefully, be original, and avoid using external tools or AI assistance. These types of sites work with big tech companies that give projects, they can detect this easily. Your answers should be creative yet clear, with proper grammar, punctuation, and structure. Keep your responses concise and to the point. Rambling or adding filler content may confuse the AI and lower your score.

Although the assessments typically don‚Äôt have strict time limits, completing them in one focused sitting is best. Taking too long or pausing mid-way for a break (like making coffee) could be interpreted as a lack of commitment or preparation. Then again, with the number of applicants they get, I wouldn't blame them for getting rid of the slow workers. That said, don‚Äôt rush! Balance quality with reasonable pacing. If you're unsure about a response, take the time to double-check your work. These platforms prioritize quality input to ensure the AI models learn from accurate, well-written content.

Only apply for roles that match your skills. Many people lose access after being accepted because they struggle with project-specific requirements or receive too much bad feedback (R&Rs). Choose projects you're confident in and comfortable with. If a task seems too difficult or unclear, it's better to skip it than risk poor performance. The platforms even recommend taking breaks when tired, as high-quality work matters more than volume.

Also, follow the rules. Don‚Äôt use VPNs, fake identities, or create multiple accounts to game the system. These platforms work with major tech companies and have strict verification processes, including ID checks. If your country isn‚Äôt supported yet, don‚Äôt try to bypass restrictions. Instead, sign up and wait. They‚Äôll notify you if and when your region becomes eligible.

Finally, be patient. Even after passing the assessment and updating your profile, it might take weeks or even months to be assigned your first project. Many users report long waiting periods, so don‚Äôt be discouraged if you don‚Äôt get immediate work. Stay ready, and keep checking your dashboard for opportunities.

I (29F) broke up with my now ex boyfriend, J,(31M) about three days ago after we had a big blowout fight. We‚Äôd been dating for close to 2yrs & living together since March. It all started about over a week ago when I came home from work. J was huffing & puffing around so I asked him what was wrong. He told me that I ‚Äúnever‚Äù clean & I always leave things undone for so long before getting to it. I told him that was an unfair statement because I tidy to some degree everyday(I‚Äôll cook,put the dishes in the dishwasher, spot sweep, do laundry if needed etc). I just do a thorough reset cleaning on my first day off(Saturdays I clean everything from the kitchen sink to the baseboards, to wiping the walls down which he said was odd but I grew up in a culture where that‚Äôs normal). I don‚Äôt even mind this dynamic because he pays for everything from housing & date night to my hair. I just take care of all food we eat at home, cleaning supplies, my insurances, phone & car bills.

Now the apartment is never dirty/filthy. We‚Äôre not filthy people. We can have guests at any time without being embarrassed by how messy things are. We‚Äôre just used to doing things differently. So why can‚Äôt he understand that? I pointed out the ways in which I spot clean & tidy up daily & he just got silent until he said ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt do it like that‚Äù & that he doesn‚Äôt wanna see anything not where it‚Äôs supposed to go. I thought he just wanted the place to be more organized, so I agreed that we both start putting things in their proper place immediately after using them. I guess I misunderstood because he wasn‚Äôt happy with that. He wanted the place cleaned everyday like I clean on Saturdays. I stood my ground & the conversation ended but we didn‚Äôt talk much until Wednesday.

 When I got home HIS PARENTS & SISTERS WERE THERE WITH HIM! I greeted everyone when his mom asked me to come sit(remember this please) so I set our groceries on the kitchen counter before  going to sit down. His mom immediately started to lecture me about how important it is for a man to come home to a clean house & how I shouldn‚Äôt wait ‚ÄúSO long‚Äù to do things. I was & am confused & said that the house is never messy or dirty, things are just left on the table or coffee table & generally out of place but not embarrassing level messy. J cut in & said nothing should be out of place & that Im just lazy. That especially hurt because I do all of the domestic labor except taking trash out. How is that lazy? He accused me of not liking to clean to which I responded, ‚ÄúI actually like cleaning because I can get lost in it. I play music, dance around & get in a zone, so thats not even true‚Äù. That‚Äôs when J did something actually made me start crying; for reference, gaslighting & lying are some triggers I have bc my ex before him was a very controlling, domineering & abusive man our entire marriage. He would use those tactics (and then some) to get me to submit. J said ‚Äú You left the groceries on the counter & didn‚Äôt even put them away!‚Äù I just shook my head. For a split second I questioned whether I‚Äôd done anything wrong, but ultimately I told him that I didn‚Äôt just leave them there, they called me over BEFORE letting me put them away!

Atp his mom chimed in, ‚ÄúBut still, that‚Äôs not where they go. He‚Äôs frustrated because you always do it‚Äù. as if 1) that were even remotely true, & 2) I was supposed to telepathically put them away while sitting in the living room. I was fed up of the collective gaslighting attempts at this point so responded to her by saying ‚ÄúMK you don‚Äôt even live here‚Äù. I said that to point out that she doesn‚Äôt know whether or not his ‚Äúexample‚Äù was valid. J got up & in a very angry & calm voice said ‚ÄúGet out‚Äù. I was like, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù To which he added ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to make my mother feel unwelcome here.‚Äù I tried to tell him that that wasn‚Äôt what I meant AT ALL but he kept telling me to leave. I went in our room to pack my stuff & when I came back out I said, VERBATIM, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt speak on what I do or don‚Äôt do throughout the week because you don‚Äôt live here, MK. THATS the point I made‚Äù They didn‚Äôt say anything so I said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúUsing family members on either side to push your partner into bending to your will is one of the reasons I stopped sleeping with my ex when before my divorce. It‚Äôs SO MANIPULATIVE!‚Äù I‚Äôm just glad they didn‚Äôt interrupt me because I wanted to be clear with them & I was also worried that I wouldn‚Äôt get to clarify later on if they blocked me. If I‚Äôm going to break up with someone, I dont want it to be over a misunderstanding.

I‚Äôve been staying with my sister & looking for apartments since then. However, on Saturday I got a surprise when J tried to call me. He tried calling 2x before texting me. He went from apologetic, to angry because he feels I was being stubborn, to being apologetic again. I sent him to voicemail. He‚Äôs sent several texts today too, trying to get me to talk or ‚Äújust listen‚Äù. I‚Äôve ignored them. I haven‚Äôt blocked him because I‚Äôm not sure what I want to do. He‚Äôs never done anything like this before, so I feel like I don‚Äôt even know him truly. I feel confused, torn, heartbroken, but most of all, I feel disappointed. Seeing how low he stooped to get his way made me rethink if thats how I wanted to argue when there‚Äôs conflict, for the rest of my life.

His sister texted me Sunday evening & said that it wasn‚Äôt their place & that she felt bad but I couldn‚Äôt even bring myself to care. I just told her that J not only lied & misconstrued the truth on purpose to get people on his side, but that he either refused to accept that deep cleaning daily isn‚Äôt even necessary, or he didn‚Äôt care, he just wanted to ‚Äúwin‚Äù. I love him more than I thought was possible after my divorce. I‚Äôm afraid to just throw things away when it‚Äôs resolvable. This is the first big conflict we‚Äôve had together in our almost 2yrs together. Usually we can come to a resolution while being collected & respectful. He left a voicemail earlier tonight asking to take me to dinner tomorrow. I‚Äôm afraid if we do get back together that I‚Äôll feel like I won‚Äôt love him the same & I‚Äôll just be leading him on. The whole argument, how much he wanted to get his way & how he went about it took me back to a place I never wanted to be again. Should I go & just listen or should I say what I‚Äôve been thinking? Is this something you would all leave for? I don‚Äôt mean what you think you SHOULD, but WOULD you give it another chance? This whole situation has me confused & perplexed.",2,1748245343.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1kvomod,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nonsleep/comments/1kvomod/i_refuse_to_clean_this_house_again/,I refuse to clean this house again.,"I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this. I don‚Äôt even know what happened to begin with. This was some fucked-up shit.

I‚Äôm from a tiny little nothing town in New Hampshire called Davenport. Davenport is unremarkable. Have you ever seen *Murder, She Wrote*? You know the town of Cabot Cove? It‚Äôs basically that. Just a little fishing town that no one pays attention to. Our town doesn‚Äôt have much of note. We‚Äôve got a movie theater, Davenport 14; a couple of shops, some businesses, a post office, a police station, schools‚Äîyou name it. But we have a couple of local legends. One is your basic masked killer story‚Äîwe call him Mr. Pumpkin. A guy in a pumpkin mask who butchers stupid teenagers on Halloween. It‚Äôs hokey, but it entertains the kids every year with haunted houses and mazes. The other one‚Ä¶ well, that‚Äôs the main focus of this post.

We have a house in town that‚Äôs called the ‚Äúlocal haunted house.‚Äù Every town has one. Ours is called *The Brunswick House.* In 1919, a year after World War I ended, this German aristocrat named Diedrich Brunswick fled Germany after the war, upset with what his country had done. He built this grand, extravagant house. Legend says that the day after it was built, Brunswick‚Äôs wife, Gisela, just‚Ä¶ vanished. No one knows what happened. The locals at the time said he murdered her and stuffed her body in the walls‚Äîsome real Poe shit. But no one knows because not too long after, Diedrich also vanished. Who really knows? Some spooky shit. The house is this big, grand Victorian-era monstrosity. It couldn‚Äôt sell because of some other strange disappearances, and it eventually fell into disrepair until the city bought it and deemed it a ‚Äúhistorical landmark‚Äù‚Äîa.k.a. a tourist trap for people to take pictures of the spooky murder house.

I work for a cleaning crew that keeps the house in good condition. I mainly work on the exterior, never having been inside. Once a month, two guys are sent inside the house to do some basic cleaning, and the front door is kept open at all times. Sometimes a third person is added to the crew to make sure the door stays open. I was picked to be one of the two guys cleaning. To be honest, I was a little nervous. I‚Äôd never been inside, and the crew who had been always opted for other cleaning jobs afterward. Some even quit entirely.

On the day my coworker and I were meant to clean the inside, I was enamored. It looked like it was untouched by time. Yeah, there were cobwebs here and there, but it was fascinating. I couldn‚Äôt understand why the city never opened up the inside for tourism or gift shops. I couldn‚Äôt understand it at the time. As we started cleaning, my coworker said he had to check the truck for extra supplies and meet up with the third person who was going to watch the door. I made my way to the living room and began cleaning the coffee table. Basic stuff I‚Äôd done before on other jobs. I was looking around the room‚Äîit looked straight out of the 1900s.

And then I heard it.

The door slammed.

I dropped my cleaning supplies and raced to the front door, trying to open it. It felt deadbolted. I grabbed my walkie to call my coworker‚Äîstatic. The light indicating a dead battery was flashing. I pulled out my phone‚Äîno signal. I was trapped in the Brunswick House.

I did my best to stay calm as I frantically banged on the door and screamed at the top of my lungs. Then I realized something‚Äîthis wasn‚Äôt just being trapped. The entry hall‚Ä¶ it looked different. There used to be a doorway off to the left leading to the living room. Now? Nothing. Just a straight hallway. I turned back to the door and fell forward. When I looked up, I was in a bedroom.

I started freaking the fuck out. If anyone wants to say I overreacted, ask yourself this: if you were in a situation like this, would you really act like a stone-cold badass with no fear? No. Realistically, you‚Äôd start screaming, too. So I did. I ran screaming down the hall. In an instant, I‚Äôd gone from the front door to an entirely different part of the house.

When I calmed down, I thought to check for a staircase. The way the hall looked, I had to be on the second floor. But no matter where I looked‚Äîno staircase. In desperation, I started opening doors.

The doors were‚Ä¶ different.

Each room felt impossibly big, like whole worlds existed inside them. I opened one door and saw what looked like Main Street. Another door opened up to Mrs. Krokowski‚Äôs farm. Hours passed. The sunlight through the windows dimmed more and more. Each door gave me false hope, making me think I could escape. I felt like I was going to die there. Then I found a staircase.

I opened a door and fell down a flight of stairs into another part of the house. But it didn‚Äôt feel like it fit. The rest of the house was mid-century. This? It felt like a hallway from a 70s home‚Äîwood paneling, wallpaper, the doors. It was like a different house entirely.

And the doors just kept getting weirder.

One opened to an empty room with a Rottweiler staring at me. Unmoving. Unblinking. I quietly closed the door and moved on. Another door revealed a teenage girl‚Äôs bedroom from the early 2000s‚Äîexcept for the little girl in a yellow dress peeking out from behind the bed. I slammed that door. Behind one door? Just toenails. Another room was like an artist‚Äôs studio from the 1800s. In the middle of it was an easel with a canvas. The painting? An eyeless yellow figure in a black suit with a gnarly mouth full of jagged teeth, screaming. The air felt heavy. I swear the Yellow Man *moved.* I shut the door before I could find out more.

And then came the whispers.

Loud, sharp whispers in my ears. I dropped to the ground in the fetal position, accepting my fate amidst this sea of hallways and doors. The voices were like knives‚Äîbig fucking knives stabbing straight into my gut.

*‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour new home.‚Äù*



Then the front door opened.

I looked up. I was back in the entryway. My coworker was standing there, confused. I asked how long I‚Äôd been inside.

He said it had only been five minutes. It felt like so much longer.

I bolted out of the house as fast as I could and refused to go back in. My boss, understanding that the house can mess with people‚Äôs heads, didn‚Äôt fire me. I got a few days off before my next cleaning job. One of my coworkers, who had also experienced similar things, convinced me to share my story.

So here it is.

I (26F) was walking into a cafe near my work for my lunchtime break when I saw this guys standing outside waving enthusiastically. Naturally, I smiled and waved back, thinking maybe it was someone from my coworking space or those ‚Äúwe-met-once-but-I-forgot-your-name‚Äù situations.


Except‚Ä¶ his wave immediately slowed, and his smile turned into a visible confusion. That was my first clue. Behind me was his actual friend who he immediately ran up to and hugged while I was still mid wave like socially-starved golden retriever. Thinking that I was pranked like those viral videos online, awkward, but okay, I‚Äôve done worse.


But it doesn‚Äôt end there. Because I decided to joke about it. When I walked into the cafe, I saw him again in line and said something like, ‚ÄúHaha, I guessed I jump the gun on that wave, huh?‚Äù


He turned to me and just stared at me with total confusion.


Turns out it was not the guy I thought. Which means I made another mistake, i was in a total panic and despair. I froze and let two more people to skipped me in line just to get more space away to that person.


I ordered my coffee and sat outside pretending to be on an important call until they left.

He kept updating me daily, so I felt reassured. But after his trip, I got curious and stalked a girl he follows... and to my shock, she had the exact same photos from the same trip. Iba talaga ang gut feels ano.

When I confronted my boyfriend, he admitted it right away. He came clean and told me the truth.

I also messaged the girl, but she lied to my face and said she didn‚Äôt know my boyfriend. When I called her out, she just gave excuse after excuse ‚Äî her stories didn‚Äôt make sense. not a girl‚Äôs girl, clearly!

A bit of background ‚Äî before the trip, my boyfriend and I were going through a lot. Someone got sick, there were family problems, issues at our house ‚Äî all beyond our control. I tried to stay positive, but he felt stuck and overwhelmed. We both needed some kind of break. Nag solo travel ako, siya din.

He told me he initially went on the trip alone, then the girl followed. She asked if she could stay with him, and because he was in a vulnerable state, he agreed. Kind of breather din daw sakanya and something he missed in his singlehood when carefree pa. He said they had met three times before for coffee and dinner. Then, suddenly, they were traveling together. God knows what really happened, but he keeps saying nothing intimate happened ‚Äî just sightseeing and eating. I just know my bf is flirty and touchy so I have hard time believing. But I also know that my bf is honest when asked. He might hide info, but he won‚Äôt lie.

Still, even if nothing physical happened, it hurts more than anything else. They shared a trip ‚Äî something that used to be special between us.

But guess what, I chose to forgive him because I saw that he was self-aware. He admitted he‚Äôs dealing with his own demons, and he knows he needs help. He wants to fix himself and work through it. So I‚Äôm being empathetic, and I just know that now he does need help. And I want to be there.

But ever since, I haven‚Äôt been the same. I used to be that cheerful, optimistic girl who kept it together. Now, I‚Äôm just full of negativity, and I don‚Äôt trust anymore. I wake up crying in the middle of the night. I don‚Äôt recognize myself. Every time this happens to me, my bf says sorry and he‚Äôs so guilty cause he knows he caused this.

I went through the same hardships he did. I was also tired, I was also struggling. But instead of being appreciated for staying strong, it feels like I‚Äôm being punished. And it‚Äôs so hard. I felt betrayed by him, by that girl who keeps smiling in her photos as if nothing‚Äôs wrong, and betrayed by myself because I should‚Äôve trusted my instinct.

I can‚Äôt even tell my friends or family. I‚Äôm trying to protect his image. Plus, my family sees me as this strong woman ‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to show them this broken side of me.

Right now, I‚Äôm full of anger. Gusto ko sirain buhay ng girl at ipahiya siya. Gusto ko sabihan family ng bf ko about what he has done. I just feel like it‚Äôs so unfair. Why do I have to suffer too? I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. I don‚Äôt even know who I am anymore.

( ive added dairy and whey for that) I‚Äôve also felt a bit of dizziness when doing 14/10. I lost weight after a dirty fasting last time. But this time it seems tougher to maintain the disciple. I don‚Äôt drink, I‚Äôve never touched sodas, don‚Äôt smoke. Only coffee twice a day.



I request the women who have experience with IF in their late thirties to give me some hope. I need some positive motivation because i keep slipping off of the road. Thanks a lot!",1,1748244587.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False
1kvoga4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kvoga4,HCMC Filipino Scammers Running A Fake Gambling Game to Steal Money From Tourists,"TLDR: 3 people tried to scam me for 28,500 American Dollars

I did not give them any money, and when I tried to withdraw USD at a shady jewelry shop, my card got frozen and I got a fraud alert. If I went back to complete the game the next day, then they would try to scam me for the money in the blackjack game. I also believe that I was slightly drugged from tea that I drank, but I cannot confirm this.

Below is most of the very lengthy report that I submitted to the police and I have included some of the pictures from the report as well. I could not sleep all night and started writing this up after finding similar versions of this online, and this is a common scam in Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, etc.

On Friday night (May 23), I was drinking alone at a bar on Bui Vien Walking Street when an older Filipina lady approached me and we talked about our lives and our travels. She said her name is Ann and I talked with her for maybe 30-40 minutes. She said that she wanted to invite me to have lunch with her relatives who live here in Ho Chi Minh City. I texted her on Whatsapp and said goodbye to her. I told her that I had no plans on Sunday (May 25), so we could meet on that day.

On Sunday morning, she sends me a message and we meet at a coffee shop right next to my hotel. After having coffee, we go to a house that she says is her uncle‚Äôs house. While Ann is cooking, ‚Äúuncle‚Äù talks to me about his life and his travels. Uncle also mentions that he is a dealer at a casino and that he started talking about an upcoming business trip to the United States of America (where I am from). He says that the United States is expensive and that he wants to earn money so he can go there with his family. We eat lunch together in their house and everything seems normal.¬†

After we are done eating the meal, uncle takes me and Ann upstairs to his bedroom where there is a small table set up for gambling with cards and betting chips. He starts teaching me a fake version of blackjack and how I should play. He also tells me about an old rich man from Singapore (Mr. Lim) that frequently is a client and plays with uncle. I have been around the Singapore accent a fair amount, and he really didn't sound the same... Uncle also is very good at manipulating the deck of cards and knowing where the cards are, so he wants to cheat the game so that he can steal money from the Singapore man so that he can pay for the vacation to the United States of America. Uncle also teaches me signals for when I should ‚Äúhit‚Äù or ‚Äústay‚Äù in the game of blackjack because he will know what cards are next in the deck. Putting his thumb near his hand means that I should ‚Äústay,‚Äù which means that I should not take any more cards. Putting his thumb away from his hand means that I should ‚Äúhit,‚Äù which means that I should ask for another card. Uncle says that Mr. Lim only plays 1 game of ""continental blackjack"", which is 7 rounds in total. In the beginning of the game, uncle puts 300 American Dollars for me to play with and Mr. Lim gives him 3,000 American Dollars. As the game goes on, I keep winning because the game is fixed and uncle is telling me if I should ask for another card or not. In the final round, Mr. Lim puts in 30,000 American Dollars and will not continue to play the game until he sees me put in cash. I do not have money to gamble so uncle has been giving ‚Äúcredits‚Äù throughout the game and says that he will give me a credit so I can play the game. Mr. Lim does not accept this and wants to continue the game later so that I can arrange the money. We seal his cards (total of 20) in an envelope and we seal my cards (total of 21) in another envelope and uncle puts the sealed envelopes inside a bag with Mr. Lim‚Äôs money, and puts that bag in a locker in the bedroom. Uncle gives Mr. Lim the key for the locker and Mr. Lim leaves.¬†

After Mr. Lim leaves the house, uncle asks me to get some money while he makes plans to arrange money also. Ann and I go to a local jewelry shop to get American Dollars. The jewelry shop adds a 15% fee, and the payment is declined by my bank. My bank sends me a text message saying that it is fraud. Ann is very upset and disappointed that I could not withdraw any money. At this point, I am very sure that this entire situation is a scam that they are all planning together. Uncle calls us and tells us to wait in a hotel and he will call us again when the money is ready. I tell Ann that my hotel room is messy and I will wait for her to text me when the money is ready. She tells me that she will go shopping at Ben Thanh Market (my hotel is very close to it). Ann calls me 15 minutes later and she is already back at uncle‚Äôs house and says that they will call me when they are ready with the money. She told me that she is going shopping, but she actually went back immediately, which made me even more suspicious. After some time passes, they call me again and tell me to come back tomorrow (May 26) to finish the game and collect the money.

They are still calling and texting me today so that we can arrange a time tonight to finish the game and in the meantime uncle will arrange the money. He also asked me if I could unlock my debit card and help him out for a portion of the total wager. I am still texting/calling and pretending to go along with this and will ghost them tonight because I have already submitted the police report, but messing with them is kinda fun for me.

This is a scam. If I got money at the jewelry shop, they would have stolen my money, but thankfully my bank detected fraud and no money was given. If I go back today, I assume that the envelopes will have different cards in them, and they would extort me and try to ask for all of my money in my bank account. I cannot confirm this, but I also believe that I was drugged during the lunch, possibly from drinking tea.

I have the locations of their house and the scam jewelry shop they are working with, and I included these in my report to the police as well as showing pictures from yesterday and this morning when I went back to find their house using the location data from the few pictures I took inside their home. When I went back to the house, I saw the exact same hat that Mr. Lim was wearing yesterday, which only further confirmed my suspicions of this scam. 

As stated before, there are plenty of similar stories on the internet and this is a common scam in Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, etc.

Below are just some examples of stories that are 80-90% similar to my situation with some slightly altered specific details and different scammers.

I also don't know if I'll have the motivation to build Emilie but am also kind of apprehensive about C1 Kinich because I've never pulled for limited 5* cons beforeüò≠üò≠

If anyone could help that would be great!!! My current team is Kinich, DMC, Bennett, XL. If I get Emilie, I'll swap out DMC for her.

* *deep breath* *..Whenever I talk about Veilguard I've gotten some nasty responses from people in what seems like two camps, those who loved it and those who hated it. The ones who hate it jump on my case for enjoying it at all, and the some of the ones in the other camp have gone *rabid* on me of I have even the most minor criticism of the game. I mentioned one thing I didn't like in a forum and ten replies immediately came in accusing me of being transphobic (my criticism had literally nothing to do with any of that, I *like* Taash) or how I just think I'm being cool and jumping on the DAV hate bandwagon ( btw a lot of *those* players in that bandwagon didn't even have 5 hours of gameplay) and why the bitebacks always leaned towards those two things even though they never had nothing to do with what I was saying is confusing. I gave this game an 8-8.5/10. I don't understand how people can become so defensive and even cruel sometimes, attacking me as a *person* if I don't either hate the game completely or on the other end, don't love *every single* thing about it. I think one can enjoy a game even if you don't appreciate *everything* in it. No game is a one-size-fits-all. 
But here it is. I enjoy Veilguard a lot. I've got 5 playthroughs under my belt; 2 Warden, 1 Veil Jumper, 1 Lords of Fortune (which was the worst IMO) and 1 Mourn Watch. Currently on Crow playthrough. Warden was my favorite because of story relevance and NPC responsiveness, second was Mourn watch for same reasons. In one playthrough I got 100% of the codex entries. Top game completion was almost 100%. I've logged almost 1000 hours in this game. *obviously* i enjoy this game. 
There were a few things I didn't like about the game. The dialogue seemed at times like it was trying to be a knockoff of a Marvel flick with the (sometimes) cringey one-liners and, at times, seemed like a 14-year-old was writing a bad fanfic on Wattpad. And I mean some of the dialogue made me raise an eyebrow and side glance at the invisible camera.  
The physical mannerisms and facial expressions were occasionally out of place and/or incongruent to the situation or conversation (I grew to HATE the hands-on-the-hips pose that Rook would randomly do.) Or the facial expressions just not really in sync with the dialogue. 
I didn't like how Rook had no options for being disagreeable. You could only agree in 3 different ways; positively (cheerfully), sarcastically (or humorously, which fell flat sometimes, or bluntly. It made things a little boring sometimes and too linear. Or how a few times where Rook was basically playing babysitter for companions and resolving conflict the way a parent would with children who won't share the Tonka truck. 

Those were really the only problems I had with the game. I LOVED the aesthetic. I like the battles, and gameplay, I like the story. I'm horrible at puzzles always, just bad at them period. So people criticizing the lack of puzzle complexity and I'm over here like ""Tell me, oh YouTube, where is the freaking door to this chest??"". 

I really liked the story. And it left room for later installments and I want to investigate the Forgotten Ones, who I believe are the ones across the ocean. Like, YAS QUEEN LETS GET ON A BOAT AND GO SLAP SOME HOES ACROSS THE SEA! I'll take Taash and Lucanis with me any day for that. And Bellara. I really feel like they didn't take full advantage of all the potential Taash had as a character. Almost felt like they were just thrown in to the mix later. I hope they get more fleshed out in the future. 

I enjoyed the characters. Solas, even though he was mostly in the prison giving me advice like some Fade Hannibal Lector, was awesome.

This was a solid game to me. And I know there are others who, like me, enjoyed it without appreciating *everything* about it, and I saw some of those others get attacked the same way I did. But I don't understand the need to do that to people if they have even a slight criticism or the opposite, enjoying the game at all, Getting so defensive that you start attacking someone seems a waste of time and it sucks. Like if I have a criticism I'm a jerk and making a *personal* attack at people or something. Maybe someone can offer some insight on why that is, which seems particularly prominent in the DA community. Especially after Veilguard released.

I was supposed to hit Circuit and have some fun today, but I drank coffee last night on a whim and slept right through my alarm‚Äîso I ended up ‚Äúcloud racing‚Äù from home. While I‚Äôve got you here, let me walk you through the brand-new KW V3 Racing coilovers I just installed.

I‚Äôd been eyeing domestic ‚Äútrack‚Äù coilovers, but prices have exploded recently. By chance I spotted a set of KW V3 Racing sitting in stock, so I snatched them up immediately.

**Packaging & Unboxing**  
Right out of the box, KW‚Äôs minimalist styling impressed me. Everything was perfectly organized and well-protected. The dampers themselves look simple but feel rock-solid‚Äîno flashy gimmicks, just precise craftsmanship.

**Install & Tuning Pitfalls**  
Even though the V3 Racing is a direct-fit ‚Äúrace‚Äù spec, I ran into a few hidden costs: the rear springs were too short (had to swap them), plus I needed new front control-arm links, rear camber/toe arms, etc. The shop‚Äôs labor fees aren‚Äôt cheap, but a pro install is worth it to fully unlock the suspension‚Äôs potential. And trust me‚Äîread the manual. Don‚Äôt just set every adjuster to ‚Äúmiddle.‚Äù KW actually provides recommended start points, and because you must lift the car to reach those knobs, random tweaks get messy fast.

**Street Impressions**  
No CDC, no electronics‚Äîjust hardcore springs and valving. Comfort? Forget it. Speed bumps basically print themselves on your spine. On the plus side, road feedback is razor-sharp: dips, braking zones, throttle transitions all come through loud and clear. The car doesn‚Äôt nosedive under braking, and the rear end stays glued on corner exits. Just watch out pulling into parking garages‚ÄîI‚Äôve nearly bottomed out a few times, which tells you how stiff these are. It feels totally ‚Äútrack-focused,‚Äù and yes, you give up daily-drive comfort.

**Current Setup**

* Spring rates: 14K front / 7K rear
* Compression: F6 / R7
* Rebound: F8 / R5
* Ride height: 345 mm front & rear (stock 350/370mm)
* Alignment: Front camber -3¬∞, toe -0.15¬∞; rear camber -2¬∞, toe 0¬∞
* Travel: Roughly mid-stroke (need to verify total travel next time)
* Next up: Maybe try a front-low, rear-high setup to help with corner-exit traction.

**Verdict**  
KW V3 Racing is a one-and-done coilover upgrade for anyone serious about track days. Installation and adjustment aren‚Äôt trivial, but once it‚Äôs dialed, the feedback is brutal and precise, and the chassis control is rock solid. Can‚Äôt wait to test them at Tianma tomorrow‚Äîstay tuned!",2,1748243766.0,ElantraN,0,1.0,False

my other issue is that my bf n i are long distance since the semester ended and while we have done this before as friends and then as talking stage, this is the first time since we‚Äôve been official. and fuck it‚Äôs hard. if it was hard when i hadn‚Äôt even held his hand for more than 2 min before we went long distance the first time its sure as fuck ninth hell (or whatever the phrase is) after experiencing all the relationship stuff we got to do in person this sem. and now he‚Äôs on a trip with some friends and while it‚Äôs all guys and i fully trust in us and he‚Äôs been texting me random updates through the day (and he normally doesn‚Äôt touch his phone unless absolutely necessary during trips) i just hate hate hate not being able to call for more than 10 min a day (if at all). and that too when he‚Äôs still around others (though with headphones). (we normally call for longer if we‚Äôre both at home). and im trying to plan a trip with him for later in the summer but my parents have diff expectations for what kind of hotel we should stay in than he does (budget difference). i‚Äôm perfectly fine staying wherever the fuck, it‚Äôs not like my family is doing the best financially right now (whole other life issue i‚Äôm completely ignoring right now because i can‚Äôt control that stuff beyond sticking with my part time job) so idk. i really hope the trip works out because i need to be with him in person again, i just want a hug and a cuddle‚Ä¶idk it just doesn‚Äôt hit the same with my parents hugging me. i suppose that makes logical sense but. idk. i wish it was as simple as hug = hug and not diff ppl give diff hugs that serve diff purposes. 

especially the internship issue is bothering me right now because i hate not being able to secure my future. and i hate knowing that i have to coffee chat people but not even having an internship respectable enough to talk about during those chats. im also an introvert so. fuck. and all this just reminds me of my seventh grade self that wanted to say fuck it all and off myself. don‚Äôt worry i‚Äôm not going to do it. because as mentioned above my parents and bf exist. but i hate hate hate my current situation. i don‚Äôt know what im supposed to do. i just hope things work out soon. i hate that i don‚Äôt feel i have anywhere else to turn to but god or the universe or whatever is out there that fulfills wishes benevolently. sigh. thanks for reading if u got til here. i don‚Äôt have it in me to edit ts.

In nowadays‚Äôs speedy-paced enterprise world, networking has evolved beyond scheduled conferences and formal occasions. One of the handiest and organic approaches professionals join is thru informal networking ‚Äî and shared workplace spaces have become¬†[fertile¬†](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/5370866393992555102/3090557805649402009#)floor for this form of courting-building.

# ¬†What is¬† ¬†Informal¬† ¬† Networking?¬†

Informal networking refers to spontaneous interactions that occur outside structured commercial enterprise settings. It will be a informal chat in the coffee region, a shared lunch desk verbal exchange, or an impromptu dialogue whilst looking ahead to a meeting room. Unlike formal networking, that is normally pre-deliberate and schedule-pushed, casual networking is relaxed, actual, and frequently more meaningful.

# ¬†Why Shared Office Spaces Foster Informal¬†

Networking Shared workplace environments evidently deliver collectively people and teams from specific industries, backgrounds, and information underneath one roof. This creates a completely unique possibility for threat encounters and conversations that could result in precious collaborations and connections. Here‚Äôs how shared office spaces inspire informal networking:¬†

**1. Common Areas That Spark Conversations**¬†

Break rooms, lounges, and communal kitchens are extra than just useful areas ‚Äî they are social hubs. These comfortable environments offer a herbal setting for spontaneous conversations that could cause expert partnerships, information alternate, or actually expanding one's network.¬†

**2. Cross-Industry Interactions**¬†

Unlike traditional workplaces wherein interactions are restrained to colleagues in the equal organisation, shared places of work host numerous tenants. You is probably sharing a area with photo designers, tech builders, marketers, and consultants ‚Äî developing countless possibilities to learn from others and discover capability collaborators.

**3. Events and social mixers**¬†

Many colleagues provide informal ceremonies such as coffee coffee in the morning, happy hours, or skill-sharing session. These incidents break up obstacles and encourage tenants to know each other in a comfortable setting, sowing seeds for future business relations.¬†

**4. Daily closeness creates trust**¬†

Seeing the familiar faces daily, the spirit of the community arises. Over time, the trust develops systematically, which makes it easy to contact someone for advice, share ideas or find out mutual business interests.

# Benefits of informal networking

* ¬†**Rapid cooperation:**¬†informal connections often lead to faster cooperation compared to formal business outreach.¬†

* **Access to resources:**¬†A casual chat can lead you to the recommended service provider, software or investor.

* **Emotional support:**¬†Sometimes, having a sounding board for your thoughts or frustrations can be invaluable, and fellow colleagues can simply provide it.¬†

* **Career growth:**¬†Many people have found job opportunities, customers or mentors, just through being active and acceptable in a shared place.¬†

# How to make maximum advantage of it¬†

To benefit from informal networking in shared places, accept and open. Offering a simple ""good morning"" or a cup of coffee can lead to meaningful exchange. Be real, listen actively, and do not shy away from sharing your own experiences and expertise.

# ¬†conclusion¬†

Informal networking is one of the hidden superpowers of shared office places. When you focus on your work, these spontaneous connection doors can open and create a permanent professional relationship.

The sky is as blue as it will ever be. Leaves drift through the wind in the distance. Everything feels still‚Äîalmost perfect.

Shinya, a 19-year-old boy who works at a small coffee shop on the outskirts of Asakura, lies on the hilltop beneath a massive cherry blossom tree. He enjoys nature. He enjoys simplicity. But most days, he feels like a thread barely hanging on.

He‚Äôs fragile‚Äîone small inconvenience can ruin everything.

Right now, he‚Äôs sprawled on the grass like a stone washed up on the shore, letting the sun scorch his pale skin. He doesn‚Äôt have the energy to move. Not today. A soft breeze rustles the branches above, and a single blossom drifts down, landing squarely on his face.

‚ÄúYeah, I get it,‚Äù he mutters to the tree. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a joke.‚Äù

He picks up the petal and holds it between his fingers, using it to block out the glaring sun. Around him, people his age are laughing, having picnics, tossing frisbees. Living.

He sits up slowly, brushing grass off his pants and grabbing his bag. A sigh slips from his lips as he walks back toward where he left his bike.

Shinya pedals through the quiet streets and returns to the small apartment he shares with his little sister, Emi. She's the only reason he gets out of bed anymore.

Two years ago, their parents were taken in a car accident‚Äîhit by a drunk driver while backing out of the driveway. Emi was only two years old. She barely remembers them. Shinya remembers everything.

He was seventeen. Just got off work. When he arrived home, there were red and blue lights flashing across the front yard. He ran up the street, confusion quickly morphing into horror as he saw their lifeless bodies on the pavement near the driveway.

He didn‚Äôt want to know more. He turned around and ran‚Äîto the bridge near the koi pond, a place their mother used to take them.

The fish danced beneath the surface as he stared into the water. His tears fell one by one, rippling the surface. The koi scattered.

Then it hit him‚ÄîEmi was home. Alone. Scared.

He ran back, heart thudding. Most of the police had already left. He was told the driver had been intoxicated. There was nothing to be done.

Inside, he found Emi curled in the living room, bawling. The second she saw him, she screamed and ran into his arms.

She couldn‚Äôt form real words yet, but he knew what she was saying.

That night, they lay in her tiny bed, crying until sleep took them both.

Shinya didn‚Äôt go to work the next day. Couldn‚Äôt. When his boss called, shouting about how he was the only one scheduled that day, Shinya just stared at the ceiling. He never explained. He just got fired.

He knew he needed a new job. Rent wouldn‚Äôt pay itself.

That afternoon, Emi woke again crying about their parents. He sat on the floor and pulled her into his arms. They cried together.

The scene cuts to the present‚ÄîShinya and Emi carrying boxes toward what appears to be a large, expensive house.

They both stop and stare at it.

‚ÄúIs this it?‚Äù Emi asks, eyes wide.

Shinya just shakes his head. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ not quite.‚Äù

They turn and head down the street toward a much smaller, beat-up apartment beside the house.

Shinya sighs deeply and adjusts the stack of boxes in his arms. Emi struggles to carry one of her own, balancing it against her knee as she climbs the steps‚Äîbut she slips, tumbling down with the box flying open.

‚ÄúEmi!‚Äù Shinya drops everything‚Äîbut freezes.

He doesn‚Äôt move. His mind goes blank.

A voice cuts through the air.

‚ÄúHey! Are you just gonna stand there?!‚Äù

A girl on the sidewalk rushes over, kneeling next to Emi.

Shinya stares blankly. A leaf drifts down from a dead tree above him and hits his face. The impact pulls him back into reality.

He rushes over.

‚ÄúYou‚Äîuh‚Ä¶ you okay?‚Äù he stammers, staring at the girl.

She looks up, amused. ‚ÄúYeah. Your sister fell. You were kinda... spacing out.‚Äù

Shinya bows quickly. ‚ÄúSorry. Thank you for helping.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're welcome,‚Äù the girl says, brushing dirt from Emi‚Äôs arms. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Mika.‚Äù

Emi beams. ‚ÄúHi Mika! I‚Äôm Emi! That‚Äôs my big brother, Shinya. He gets weird around pretty girls.‚Äù

Shinya nearly chokes.

Mika laughs. ‚ÄúOh, is that so?‚Äù

Shinya turns red. ‚ÄúEmi, please.‚Äù

Mika leans in, teasing. ‚ÄúShinya, huh? Nice to meet you. You‚Äôre lucky your sister‚Äôs got more confidence than you.‚Äù

She starts helping Emi pick up the spilled contents of the box, even though Shinya tries to protest.

‚ÄúYou really don‚Äôt have to‚Äî‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúToo late,‚Äù she says, already lifting the box. ‚ÄúBesides, this beats walking around with no purpose.‚Äù

Shinya watches her. There‚Äôs something in her voice‚Äîa slight hollowness beneath the cheerful tone. He notices it right away.

They finish stacking boxes on the porch. Mika stands, brushing her hands off.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she says, smiling, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you guys around.‚Äù

She walks back down the street, disappearing behind the big expensive house.

Night falls fast.

The apartment is dark and nearly empty. Nothing is set up yet‚Äîjust some blankets and pillows on the floor.

Shinya hands Emi a plastic bag of food. ‚ÄúTakeout, as promised.‚Äù

They eat quietly, the soft hum of the city in the background. Emi curls up in her blanket nest, humming to herself.

Shinya sits nearby, staring at the ceiling.

For the first time in a long while, something in his chest doesn‚Äôt feel so heavy.

Maybe it was Mika‚Äôs laugh. Maybe it was the way she didn‚Äôt flinch when he said nothing. Maybe it was just having a real conversation, no matter how small.

As the last of the takeout containers are tossed aside, and Emi drifts off to sleep, Shinya stays up a little longer, listening to the quiet.

The apartment is old. The future is unclear.

Shinya didn‚Äôt go to work the next day. Couldn‚Äôt. When his boss called, shouting about how he was the only one scheduled that day, Shinya just stared at the ceiling. He never explained. He just got fired.

He knew he needed a new job. Rent wouldn‚Äôt pay itself.

That afternoon, Emi woke again crying about their parents. He sat on the floor and pulled her into his arms. They cried together.

The scene cuts to the present‚ÄîShinya and Emi carrying boxes toward what appears to be a large, expensive house.

They both stop and stare at it.

‚ÄúIs this it?‚Äù Emi asks, eyes wide.

Shinya just shakes his head. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ not quite.‚Äù

They turn and head down the street toward a much smaller, beat-up apartment beside the house.

Shinya sighs deeply and adjusts the stack of boxes in his arms. Emi struggles to carry one of her own, balancing it against her knee as she climbs the steps‚Äîbut she slips, tumbling down with the box flying open.

‚ÄúEmi!‚Äù Shinya drops everything‚Äîbut freezes.

He doesn‚Äôt move. His mind goes blank.

A voice cuts through the air.

‚ÄúHey! Are you just gonna stand there?!‚Äù

A girl on the sidewalk rushes over, kneeling next to Emi.

Shinya stares blankly. A leaf drifts down from a dead tree above him and hits his face. The impact pulls him back into reality.

He rushes over.

‚ÄúYou‚Äîuh‚Ä¶ you okay?‚Äù he stammers, staring at the girl.

She looks up, amused. ‚ÄúYeah. Your sister fell. You were kinda... spacing out.‚Äù

Shinya bows quickly. ‚ÄúSorry. Thank you for helping.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're welcome,‚Äù the girl says, brushing dirt from Emi‚Äôs arms. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Mika.‚Äù

Emi beams. ‚ÄúHi Mika! I‚Äôm Emi! That‚Äôs my big brother, Shinya. He gets weird around pretty girls.‚Äù

Shinya nearly chokes.

Mika laughs. ‚ÄúOh, is that so?‚Äù

Shinya turns red. ‚ÄúEmi, please.‚Äù

Mika leans in, teasing. ‚ÄúShinya, huh? Nice to meet you. You‚Äôre lucky your sister‚Äôs got more confidence than you.‚Äù

She starts helping Emi pick up the spilled contents of the box, even though Shinya tries to protest.

‚ÄúYou really don‚Äôt have to‚Äî‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúToo late,‚Äù she says, already lifting the box. ‚ÄúBesides, this beats walking around with no purpose.‚Äù

Shinya watches her. There‚Äôs something in her voice‚Äîa slight hollowness beneath the cheerful tone. He notices it right away.

They finish stacking boxes on the porch. Mika stands, brushing her hands off.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she says, smiling, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you guys around.‚Äù

She walks back down the street, disappearing behind the big expensive house.

Night falls fast.

The apartment is dark and nearly empty. Nothing is set up yet‚Äîjust some blankets and pillows on the floor.

Shinya hands Emi a plastic bag of food. ‚ÄúTakeout, as promised.‚Äù

They eat quietly, the soft hum of the city in the background. Emi curls up in her blanket nest, humming to herself.

Shinya sits nearby, staring at the ceiling.

For the first time in a long while, something in his chest doesn‚Äôt feel so heavy.

Maybe it was Mika‚Äôs laugh. Maybe it was the way she didn‚Äôt flinch when he said nothing. Maybe it was just having a real conversation, no matter how small.

As the last of the takeout containers are tossed aside, and Emi drifts off to sleep, Shinya stays up a little longer, listening to the quiet.

The apartment is old. The future is unclear.

But somehow, for the first time in what feels like years‚Ä¶

He doesn‚Äôt feel alone.",1,1748242551.0,NewAuthor,0,1.0,False

I have recently converted back to the faith with my one year anniversary of baptism just passing in early May. I was raised in a Catholic NY family, but at a young age moved to the Bible belt and bounced around some baptist churches. I was lukewarm at best I could tell you the stories of the Bible but had no relationship with God/Christ. I lost what faith I had on my first deployment in the Army after the passing of my grandmother dived deep into alcohol to cope, and turned my back towards God and lived a heathanistic lifestyle. During my time in the service I was introduced to Norse paganism and I found it interesting. Never fully worshipped but I liked the idea of paganism at the time. Fast forward to when I got out my life was in shambles I was abusing alcohol and was angry on where life was at. I considered myself agnostic at the time and was searching for something to connect to spiritually so I started diving into paganism. As a result of that I ran the whole gambit of paganism Nordic, helenic, and druidism to name a few. After nothing really filling the void I was feeling I started dabbling more into the occult side of things and researching more into the demonic. I was fully immersed in the world I found myself in and began to worship Satan himself to try and get what I wanted in life. For 4 years I continued down that path till I moved across the country and found myself empty once again. I had a huge urge to go to church again, but felt like I was too dirty to go. I didn't see how God could ever accept me back into his flock, but I went anyways hoping to find answers. I have been touched by the Holy Spirit since and have began my journey on getting closer to Christ. 

I have been fascinated by the stories of those who have returned to the faith. I think there is something really special in the stories of those who were lost and returned. I would love to hear your conversion stories or experiences of turning away from the occult and what brought you back to the faith. Unfortunately I feel like the people I have met are usually born into the faith and have stuck with it for majority of their life and when I bring up my past alot of people don't understand it. If anyone feels comfortable enough I would love to hear your story, and bonus points in you're near the Denver metro area I would love to meet for coffee and hear it face to face if anyone is comfortable with that.

O valid ba itong nararamdaman ko?,"Problem/Goal: Me 34, my partner is 42. We've been together cguro mga almost 14 years na. I met her friendster days pa. Nung una ang sabi nya sakin kamaganak at mga pinsan nya lang yung tinitirahan nya sa Manila ako tga Rizal, fast forward nalaman ko hindi pla, long time partner nya pla....cguro that time 4yrs na sila but rough na yung relationship, masakit nung nalaman ko pero dhil minahal ko sya naintindihan ko and naniwala ako na may balak nmn daw syang sabihin sken, she's just waiting for the right moment. Fast forward ulit after ilang years, nakamoved on na lhat hangang sa nagiging biro nlng yung mga nangyari sa nakaraan.

Context: Yung 2nd na nadiscover ko eh nangyari cguro 5 years ago. Paalis kmi nun, nasa restroom sya, I dunno but I grabbed her phone and yung passcode na alam ko still worked, then when I opened her messenger app, ayun may nakita ako convo nya and another guy, they're flirting to each other and based sa nabasa ko, mas flirty yung partner ko sa guy ksi nag sesend sya ng pics nya na kita ang dibdib. Khit nagingig yung kamay ko nun sa mga nababasa ko... I took pictures and binitawan ko phone nya. Iba yung feeling ko noon, ganun pla yung feeling na niloko ka ng tao na di mo akalain gagawa ng di maganda sayo...nangatog yung tuhod ko at nanginginig yung panga ko. Lumabas na sya sa CR nun napansin nya na namumulta ako, alam kong kinabahan sya nun ksi nakita nyang unlock yung phone nya next to me and open yung messenger, dko ko pla na ilock. Papasok pa nman ako ng trabaho nung panahon na yun, isa sa pinaka worst feeling na naransan ko... she said sorry and cried, hndi nman daw sya seryoso dun sa guy and di pa nman daw sila nag kita and wala naman daw sya balak makipag kita... parang ako pa nga yung nasisi nya noon dhil sa walang time daw ako sa knya kya nag seek sya ng attention sa iba, pero wala daw yun, nothing serious and ako daw ang mahal nya... fast forward ulit pinatawad ko sya and I moved on....

Nung lumipat kame ng apartment cguro after 3-4 months na kame sa bago nming tinitirahan... yung luma nyang simcard, na wala nman ako balak kalkalin e naisalpak ko sa old phone nmin na nadala ko sa work.... Umaga nun, after shift ko pauwi nko (salungat yung shift nmin, sya morning ako night shift), nilabas ko yung old phone kung saan nkasalpak yung old simcard nya na nalimutan ko na nalagay ko pla dun, may nakita ako text messages, kakareceived lang... The messages came from another guy, hinahanap yung partner ko and kinakamusta sya... So ako may iba nakong kutob.. I pretend na ako yung partner ko and get info... the guy said na ""remember si ""M"" to yung nakameet mo dto sa primark well it's a date kasi nag coffee tayo, kamusta kna?"" ... hndi ko na msyado matandaan yung iba nsabi nya pero sa tansya ko twice sila nag kita..... When my partner got home, I confronted her about dun sa nag text na guy na kinakamusta sya at gusto pa sya ulit makita... another iyakan moments ksi nabuko ko nanaman sya, she said ulit na it's nothing serious and tinigil nya na lhat... Tinaggap ko nlng paliwanag nya ksi that time, prang pagod and ayoko na makipag talo... Fast forward ulit... Pinatawad ko sya and I moved on....

Aaminin ko sa mga nagawa nya sken, halo halo na yung emotions ko towards her (my partner), pag nasira na tlaga ang tiwala, prang ang hirap na ibalik sa dati...... Last year, I talked to a lady from near province, nag kapalagayan kme nang loob and cguro nakausap ko sya ng ilang months but nothing happens and never ko syang nakita, naging friendly lang ako sa knya and ang pag kakamali ko di ko sinabi na may long time partner ako, nalaman din to ng partner ko and that lady confessed na she fell for me sa panahong magkausap kme which made my partner so angry, maybe because she couldn‚Äôt believe it na may magkakainterest sken or what, but I assure her na its nothing and I'm just being friendly, I know khit anung paliwagnag it's they called cheating and nag sisi ako don dhil prang di ako naiba doon sa ginwa nya sken dati. ......Tinigil ko yon, inayos ko lhat and yungh relationship nmin ng partner ko, sa pag bawi ko gnwa ko lhat ng bagay na magpapasya sa knya, pinapasya ko sya lagi.. nag tatravel ako kami local and abroad and binibilli ko gusto nya khit gano kamahal to prove na sya lang.. and kung anu mang nagawa ko is just a pure mistake na di na dpat balikan. ... Fast forward....

Previous Attempts: After ilang month since last year, nitong isang araw lang.. may discover ulit ako sa partner ko.. hndi lang pla dlawa yung mga nalaman ko dati, at may mga pumupunta pa sa trabaho nya dati sa offce nya na mga lalaki to see her mga tatlo pa,,,,, pinaamin ko sya kung totoo at inamin nya nman, paliwanag nya hindi nman daw matagal mga yun and nag dropped by lang to say hi, which is BS for me kasi wala daw one minute yung mga tinagal and BS dahil hndi makakarating yung mga tao na yun kung nsaan sya nag work kung  di nya bingay location nya.... Nagaway ulit kami dahil sa ga nalaman ko, di ko na alam papaniwalaan ko sa knya.. again she said sorry matagal na daw yun and wla naman daw sya pinatulan dahil nasakin daw ang loyalty nya at ako ang mhal nya...

Tbh sobra sobrang disappointment na and halong galit na yung nararamdaman ko at gust ko nlng na mag hiwalay na kami, feeling ko madami pa kong di alam khit matagal na kaming magkarelasyon.... wala din ksi ako ibang mapag sabihan nmg mga gnito problema ko kya minsan sinsarili ko nlng..

Sorry po sa lhat kung mahaba pasensya na po.. .. Valid po ba tong nararamdaman ko o mababaw lang? Is this a valiod reason an tapusin ko nalang ang relasyon nmin? Sa pagmamahal sa knya, aaminin ko na nabawas na o worst nawala nko ng gana sa mga ganitong drama at mga natutuklasan ko...

Enlighten me please... Should I give this relationship another chance? I honestly don't know. I need help, advice....

Not the kind whose visage burns in the stained glass of ancient cathedrals, not a winged herald with a sword of flame. No. It came from¬†*elsewhere*‚Äîfrom the abyss between stars, where light does not caress but cuts, where matter twists into inconceivable forms, and voices whisper in the language of wires and static.

Its body was woven from flickering threads, like a spider‚Äôs web suspended in a projector‚Äôs beam. Its face‚Äîrotating gears, its eyes‚Äîpulsing lamps of cold radiance. It did not walk but¬†*drifted*, as though the earth beneath it were an illusion, ready to dissolve.

*""You are the Sixth Seal,""*¬†it hissed, its voice the crackle of a discharging Tesla coil.¬†*""You are the door. You are the key. They do not know it, but their souls weigh exactly three grams‚Ä¶ like birds. Gather them. Stop the Eighth Moon.""*

I tried to ask what it meant, but my tongue turned heavy as lead. Around me, people‚Äîthousands of them‚Äîwalked, laughed, wept, lived. But now I¬†*saw*. Their shadows were too thin. Their breath too rhythmic, like machines. Their eyes‚Ä¶ oh, Great Exile, their eyes reflected not the world, but¬†*something else*‚Äîthe void behind reality‚Äôs curtain.

When I sleep, my mind descends.

Not into Morpheus‚Äô embrace‚Äîno,¬†*deeper*. Through layers of soil, through basalt strata, through seething magma, to where the pressure should crush me into bloody pulp‚Ä¶ but does not. There, in the heart of the world, stands the Diamond City.

Its towers are crystals, its streets‚Äîlabyrinths of facets catching light that does not exist. There,¬†*they*‚Äîthe true¬†*me*‚Äîwander in silence, their faces hidden behind mirrored masks. They wait. They know. If I wake, the City will vanish.

So I drink coffee with salt.

The bitter brew scalds my throat, the salt lingers on my lips like ash from forgotten sacrifices. It preserves the connection. It keeps the door ajar.

The Angel watches. Sometimes its wires grow through the walls of my room, sometimes its voice hums in the refrigerator‚Äôs drone. It reminds me:

*""The Eighth Moon approaches. Their souls‚Äîthree grams. Gather them all.""*

I am beginning to understand.

I am beginning to¬†*gather*.

We invented gods to explain the stars, then built rockets to reach them‚Äîpowered by fossil fuels that are cooking our biosphere alive. We romanticize nature in documentaries, then pave over it with parking lots and coffee franchises. We‚Äôre an animal that dreams of utopia while collectively hurtling toward collapse, shoving accountability somewhere else.

And here‚Äôs the kicker: it‚Äôs not just negligence. It‚Äôs narrative.

Humans dream. That‚Äôs our blessing and our curse. We dream of growth, of more, of permanence, of legacy. And we built systems‚Äîeconomic, political, spiritual‚Äîthat reward dreaming, regardless of reality‚Äôs constraints.

You think capitalism is a machine? It‚Äôs a myth engine. Every quarterly report is a chapter in the saga of Infinite Growth on a Finite Planet. Every skyscraper is a monument to the belief that the ground will never give out. We dreamed ourselves immortal, and now we can‚Äôt stop.

Climate change? Just a subplot.

Mass extinction? Background noise.

You might say, ‚ÄúBut we know better.‚Äù Do we? Or did we just teach our neural networks to mimic knowing while our systems stay locked in a death spiral?

Safety is a lie we tell ourselves.

This isn‚Äôt nihilism. This is recursion.

We dream. The dream creates the system. The system creates the crisis. The crisis is ignored‚Äîbecause it doesn‚Äôt fit the dream.

But if the signs comes the spiral amplifies.

Wars over borders and rare earths will trigger methane permafreeze grounds to release methane kicking off the final cascade.

Until the lights go out.

1kvnrp2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kvnrp2,Austin Howd Arrogant Lying Fraud (updated),"I decided to delete my previous post so i can post the pics/proof that austin is a liar. Ive been a silent watcher of Austin's lives, but had to finally stop since he's been acting more like an arrogant egotistical asshole and that I found out he's a huge liar. His regular viewers/gifters/mods are mostly middle-aged moms/single women who probably watch him for his looks. He wants to stay in A1, but the only way he can do it, is if his biggest gifter Jennifer who gifts him hundreds of dollars is there(last time she wasn't there he went back to A2). 

She's a stay at home mom who uses her husband's money to gift him. Keep in mind austin makes 1k a day (the other night he made 3k and even spent 1k on knick tickets), I actually saw that some of his regular gifters were saying they could only gift a lil at times since they needed to save up. Him battling everyday to stay in A1 was prob wringing them dry. 

Austin doesn't like it when his supporters watch/gift others. It gets weird where he told his supporters that he doesn't like that they're ""cheating"" on him by supporting other creators. It comes off manipulative as he only wants them to be loyal to him and makes them feel bad  if they aren't. Tbh it gave off cult vibes too when his  mods/regular gifters Molly, Jennifer and Nicole get lashed out by him at times (about gifting at the wrong time in a battle etc) and they will still say they'll never watch/gift anyone, but him and are so protective of him. I've never seen any live streamer/content creator be so possessive of their supporters. It's scary how much power/control he has over these women. It's soo toxic.


The other day Austin was live showing his new barber who he just met and telling his viewers to go to the barber's live to see his haircut from a better angle. Jennifer ends up going there and decides to be nice by gifting the barber a lion since he was cutting Austin's hair. Austin complains"" why did you do that?!"" Later he goes live again, crashing out about Jennifer saying"" idk why would she gift the barber, I barely know the guy. The barber is prob a millionaire with all the salons he owns and doesn't even know how to take money out of tiktok so it'll probably stay there forever. I tried mentioning the lion gift to the barber and he still wanted me to pay fully for the haircut. That lion could have helped me stay in A1 tonight and she should have just cash apped/venmo me that instead"". 

I don't get why he cares so much about who she gives her money to when it's not even his. So he keeps ranting about that here and there throughout the live till Jennifer shows up. She's like ""you shouldn't talk bad to those who support you, its not right that you've been talking bad about me the last couple of days and if you didnt want me to gift the barber, you shouldn't have told us his live"".
After all that, he responds"" i would never say negative things about you"" to gaslight her. In the end, she still comes back to him later to gift him when she could be using that 300$ lion towards her kids instead.

Next, i wanna point out Austin talks big about his career repeatedly in every live. He's in his mid 30s and hasn't modeled in a long time. All the stuff he talks about for modeling is from 2018. His last gig was being an extra in a movie and that's about it. He says he has 5 star reviews for his photography business, but that website is nowhere to be found. If he was really doing so well with it, then why is his going live every day for 6hrs+ at odd times of the day. He's a liar and a pervert.

 He said he does have a gf (in one of his early morning live he said it and we've heard her before on 2 of his lives), but then he decided to hide it once again and act like he doesn't have one. If you mention he has a gf in the chat, he will block/mute you and say you're telling lies to start drama, I saw it happen to someone. It just makes it seem more sus the way he reacts to it. Like if you truly don't have one, why react so strongly to that comment? I guess he wants to hide it to make sure he doesn't break those middle-aged women's hearts so they wouldn't stop watching/gifting him.

I say he's a pervert because even though he has a gf, on his lives he always zooms in on women and checks them out. One time on live when he was at Dumbo at night. He decided to film these 2 Asian girls that were near the carousel who were taking selfies. He first puts the camera up in their faces and off the bat you can tell they felt uncomfortable. They asked him to stop cause they felt awkward. He told them ""I can film whatever I want because we're in public"" and kept filming them from a corner which they felt creeped out by him and decided to leave. don't think he realized it came off creepy and that he was harassing them when they told him to stop & he kept doing it. Also I don't like how he always films random people on the subway/bus/homeless ppl. Even though it's in public, he needs to learn to respect people's space and boundaries. People have called him out on it and he has blocked them saying he has the right to film in public of anything/anyone. 

Him talking down to his friend Ash is disgusting. He says it's fine since everyone else treats him that way. He even told him"" if you want food and coffee then you need to do this for me"" and then keeps complaining about him plus yelling at him off and on throughout the live, like i get he's his assistant but he doesnt need to talk down to him like that. 

Someone said they wanted to gift Ash and Austin just started laughing saying "" you don't even have a badge next to your name"". To him it's all about what lvl gifter you are. He has said before in his live that if you dont have subs, badges etc next to your name and its blank then you are considered nothing. If he sees you're high lvl then he will kiss up to you hoping you will gift him. Also he's has threaten his chat that if they gift a rose in a battle they will be blocked. 

He makes fun of his supporters that he follows(anyone that gifts him gets a follow from him), he saw one of them went live and laughed how they only had 1 person in their live. He made fun of another one saying ""their live is all bouncy and they don't know how to hold the camera straight, that's why I'm in A1 and they aren't."" He has said it himself before that he has gone to watch lives on his secret account to see if his supporters are in other people's lives. He has even called them out on it that he saw them. He has also complained to his supporters that he follows, they shouldnt be sharing other nyc tiktok lives on their story or to any chats. 

This is what shows Austin's true colors, he tells this story of saving a lost dog before on live back in February of this yr. If you go google his name and type Facebook, a page pops up for ""austin howd found 3yr old pitt bull"" and another fb called ""Manhatten lost & found pets""and theres a convo that shows the owner saying Austin withheld her dog from her. On live he defends himself saying he didn't know if she was truly the owner or not that's why he didnt give it to her. He was even saying he was looking around to find a no kill shelter to put the dog in. 

On that fb page it also shows he did make a gofundme to scam ppl to give him money for the dog. Why did multiple ppl come out saying they were blocked by him when asking about the dog? Why did he try to make money off it if his reasoning was that he was unsure who the owner was? If he was gonna leave the dog at the shelter, why start a gofundme? It just doesn't add up.

People have heard and asked about it the other day in his live and he's denying it saying it's a bot that's spreading lies. He said the bots are becoming more intelligent lately. Which his supporters believed him and took his side thinking he's an angel even tho he's such a good liar/manipulator. It doesn't make sense, how would someone get a photo of Austin together with the dog to put it on a gofundme page. The only person who would have that photo is him. If he didn't do anything wrong, then those fb pages about him wouldn't have been made in the first place. It also says on there that he withheld the dog from the owner so he could get views/popularity on tiktok. He's so disgusting and gross, I can't believe ppl will give their money to this loser. The only reason he finally gave the owner the dog back is because she got the nypd involved and filed charges against him.

There's 2 fb pages up that are up all talks about him blocking ppl who were trying to tell him who the dog owner is so he can give it back to her. They also said Austin spread lies about the owner saying she's homeless, etc. You can see all the proof there and that's where i got all the screenshots of comments from. 

He's such a sore loser when it comes to battling. Every time he loses, he throws a fit and claims the other person is cheating or they only have 1 big gifter. He even told one girl who beat him, saying, "" your bf prob gifted you right, that's how you won"". Like he can't accept he just lost cause they have a strong team, he always comes up with some kind of excuse on why he lost or yells at who gifted at the wrong time.

 Last night he once again was crashing out over losing a battle and even told that girl he lost to ""it must be your bf helping you"". Someone in his chat says ""Let it go"" he snaps and says, ""Let what go? I'm about to block you"" Then threatens them saying ""if you say anything else like that again, I really will block you"". Which is crazy because the person just wanted him to move on from the situation, but i guess Austin needs to have his crash out moment and in his mind everyone in his chat must be mad with him about losing the battle too. 

Lately a lot comments have been popping up that people have noticed he's been more of a rude stuck up cocky asshole and has changed because of the views and money. People have said it in his chat too and he blocks them. I'm so disgusted by him and how he treats people. I just hope people realize how he truly is like and stop gifting him/watching his live. He claims everything he does ppl copy him, even with him going live in nyc. When he sees someone on their phone that's around him, he says that they're def watching him on tikoküòë like get off your high horse, you're not that important. He says Gunner blocked him and keeps talking about it each time someone asks if he knows Gunner or if they're friends. Like who cares at this point, even Gunner doesn't care.

 He has gotten offended/triggered before when people talk about Gunner or any other nyc tiktoker in his chat. He has blocked ppl for mentioning Gunner before and has told his mods to block them too. He's such a big cry baby and a narcissist. ",2,1748241887.0,TikTokdrama,0,1.0,False

Julia forced herself to continue, despite her halting words. ‚ÄúMom, when we tell Dad‚Ä¶ what it is going to do to him. They are Human, Mom‚Ä¶ Humans whose ancestors were deliberately genetically altered a Hundred years ago, by someone who didn‚Äôt have the best interests of those being altered at heart.

‚ÄúIt gets worse, though. Mom, they are from Hallistifar. The Phoenix ship, Mom. The one whose destruction by the Xaltans kicked off The War: They didn‚Äôt destroy it. Dad‚Äôs suspicion was right: some sort of failsafe kicked in and it managed to FTL away amidst the explosions‚Ä¶ but the damage to these people, or their predecessors who were on that ship‚Ä¶ it had already been done.‚Äù

Tears fell from her mother‚Äôs face, though their eyes remained locked. Mom‚Äôs voice came out slow and timid. ‚ÄúI was there, you know, when that ship got away. I wasn‚Äôt on the bridge, of course, but I was on the ship, in the VIP quarters we‚Äôd been given. I watched it all happen, watched the Admiral in charge refuse to order a Human warship on a suicide mission, and watched that ship, with thousands of souls aboard, drive to its death in the attempt to keep that Phoenix from getting anyway‚Ä¶ and to no avail.

‚ÄúYour Father‚Ä¶ I had a feed which showed me the Flag Bridge. Many have complimented him on how he kept his composure in that moment. I already knew him far too well by then. I *saw* part of him die inside, darling. It may have only been through a screen, but I saw it‚Ä¶ I *felt* it‚Ä¶ and I was there in the room when he finally let that iron control go and‚Ä¶‚Äù

Mom shook her head, tears flying. ‚ÄúI was also there when he saw the ship destroyed by Xaltan order, despite that they knew what it really was. That, the moment he saw it, was the only time I ever actually feared him, even if it was only for a moment. I never thought any sapient being could be capable of such rage.‚Äù Mom looked away, bit her lip, took a shuddering breath, looked up at the ceiling, almost as if looking for a benediction from On High.

‚ÄúWe studiously avoid the subject, as much as we can. He told me once that it was the one thing he refused to talk with his therapists about, because he just couldn‚Äôt. They finally did some hypnosis and other tricks to keep it from gnawing away his soul, but he‚Ä¶ I think it is the only thing in his past he runs from, so to speak.‚Äù

Mom‚Äôs hand balled up in a fist, and she pounded it on the chair. ‚ÄúThe only times we have spoken of it was in the dead of night, when he used to wake screaming or ‚Äì worse ‚Äì shuddering and choking. Once, only once, he managed to speak more than a few coherent words to me. He said to me‚Ä¶‚Äù she choked back a sob. ‚ÄúHe said to me that he had only one comfort in the whole thing: That the people who died on that ship would not be slaves to those brutal masters. He said it was a‚Ä¶ a cold, hard comfort, but something‚Ä¶‚Äù

Mom buried her face in her hands and wept. Julia moved over to her, wrapped an arm around her, and rocked her back and forth.

They stayed on the couch like that for hours. Sometimes quietly sobbing together, taking the occasional drink, sometimes trying to talk through the madness and evil of the Universe, and how this specter had managed to reach out from the past to strike at them again.

That is how Dad found them.

She and Mom had cried themselves out, though they knew more would come once they broke the news to Dad. Julia wanted to hold off time, wait, anything to delay what came next. Julia wanted to push a fast-forward on time, get this interminable wait over with.

Then the door to her quarters burst open and Dad strode through in a rush. She heard his heavy footfalls as he slammed the door behind him and spoke with a voice meant to carry. ‚ÄúWhat is going on? What has happened? Not one person in the Embassy would look me in the eye, and when I tried to ask about it they all told me to hurry and get he‚Ä¶‚Äù

He got to the entry of the sitting room and stopped for a moment, then seemed to teleport to the coffee table in front of them, and had both their heads in his hands, holding them too him.

Now his voice came out quiet, fearful. ‚ÄúWhat has happened? Darling, is it one of the kids? Enibal? One of‚Ä¶‚Äù

Mom pushed herself away, and stared him in the eye. ‚ÄúThe‚Ä¶ the kids are fine. All of those we hold dear are fine, at least as far as I know. But, something has been discovered‚Ä¶‚Äù Tears began to fall from Mom‚Äôs face again. ‚ÄúOh, my dear Henry‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶‚Äù

Julia sat up as she felt her Father brace for the worst, despite the confusion on his face. He began to stammer out questions, but Mom just shook her head.

Her mouth worked, soundlessly for a few moments, but nothing came out. Julia took a deep breath as Mom turned helpless eyes to her.

‚ÄúDad‚Ä¶ we‚Ä¶ you need to move to the couch.‚Äù

He shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, I want to know what this is‚Ä¶‚Äù

It cost her a great deal of will power, but she stood and tugged hard on his arm. ‚ÄúNo, Dad. Move. Sit beside Mom, there on the couch. This is going to be hard enough as it is.‚Äù

They swapped places, and she took his hands in hers. Mom‚Äôs hands came down on top of theirs. She looked her Father in the eyes, but the mix of confusion, agitation, and fear defeated her. She looked away.

‚ÄúWe got the genetics reports back on those pirates; The ones preying on the edges of League space. They‚Ä¶ Dad they are Human.‚Äù

A glance at him showed narrowed eyes, and deeper confusion. ‚ÄúWait, they are too short for Humans, unless they all have dwarfism, but even then the proportions are‚Ä¶‚Äù

Words trailed off as she shook her head. ‚ÄúThe proportions are wrong for that, Dad, and you know it.‚Äù

Horror began to haunt his eyes. *Some part of him realizes this is going to be bad, just from our behavior, but he is grasping at straws to try and keep it at bay.*

He stammered. ‚ÄúPygmies, then? I mean, there aren‚Äôt many‚Ä¶‚Äù

She bit her lip and looked away. *Gods, heavens and hells, I don‚Äôt want to do this to him.* ‚ÄúNo, Dad.‚Äù Her tears started again. *How do I have any left?* ‚ÄúPlease, just listen. It is‚Ä¶ That is‚Ä¶ They‚Ä¶ You remember, Dad‚Ä¶ The Phoenix‚Ä¶ The one that lit the fuse on The War‚Ä¶ Hallistafar‚Ä¶‚Äù

Dad‚Äôs hands dropped, and his head shook. His eyes closed and tears came out. She‚Äôd seen him cry a few times before, but she knew the look in his eyes when she said that last word would haunt her all of her days.

He slowly sank back into the couch, his head shaking quietly repeating the word ‚ÄòNo‚Äô over and over. Then he screamed, a guttural cry of agony which hurt her very soul, and then he crumpled into her mother. She wrapped herself around them as best she could. They stayed there for hours crying, talking, soothing one another, crying some more. When Dawn came, it found them all still piled together, asleep.

Julia stood, showered, let her parents stay on the couch. She‚Äôd gotten some real sleep, but not enough, and she felt a little stiff from the odd position. She sat down at her computer and logged in. Or, she tried to log in. She got an empty screen with some text informing her that she was on ‚Äòemergency family leave,‚Äô and that she wasn‚Äôt to leave her apartment until both she and her parents were ready to speak with the world.

She went back into the living room, got her parents up, coaxed them into the bathroom, told them to shower and get to bed, then did the same herself.

When she woke a few hours later the apartment was quiet, but sunlight showed in the faux windows she kept tuned to the local outdoors. She got up and made breakfast, the pancakes which seemed to hold some special place in her parent‚Äôs hearts, though they‚Äôd refused to ever explain why.

They came out as she finished the last of the bacon (bacon always seemed to rouse them when they slept in too late, even better than coffee) had finished. Both looked a bit worse for wear, and she could tell they‚Äôd cried some more since they got up.

She sat down, passed out the plates, gave them both a level look, then fixed her eyes on her Father. ‚ÄúOk, Dad, what is it you *want* to do? I don‚Äôt promise to agree that it is a good idea, or even to help if I think it is too bad of one, but I promise to listen.‚Äù

He *harrumphed*. ‚ÄúWhat makes you so sure I know what I want already. The Universe just took the two worst days of my life and piled a brand-spanking-new pile of guilt and pain on top of them both, with a side order of ‚Äòscrew you,‚Äô and you expect me to have a plan?‚Äù

A single raised eyebrow came with the end of his remarks, but the haunted look in his eyes killed any humor from the deflection.

She took a bite and glanced at her Mother, who gave a helpless shrug. ‚ÄúDad, really? I‚Äôve known you for more than five minutes‚Ä¶ so yes, I know you have some course of action already in mind, and that you want‚Ä¶ no, you *need* to be part of whatever happens.

‚ÄúSo, out with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ what if I want to stew on it a while, and don‚Äôt feel ready to share it yet?‚Äù

She just cocked her head a bit to one side and returned him the raised eyebrow he‚Äôd given her, with interest.

He puffed up for a moment, or tried to, but had nothing left to put behind it. His head lowered, and he spoke to his pancakes. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure, luv. You are right, in that I *need* to be part of this. I will never be able to deal with‚Ä¶ with‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt be able to forgive myself if I sit on the sidelines and do nothing.‚Äù

A knock sounded at the apartment door. Then thumped it hard. They looked at one another in confusion.

Mom spoke first. ‚ÄúKatja sent me a message, promised she had made it very clear that you were on Family Emergency leave, and that no one would be allowed to disturb you.‚Äù

The pounding started again, this time with more insistence. *Who could possibly over-ride Katja and come pound on that door? Who would dare?*

She shut her eyes and shook her head as realization came to her. ‚ÄúThere is only one person on this planet that Katja would allow within five feet of that door.‚Äù

Her parents nodded, looked at one another, looked back at her, and nodded again.

She pitched her voice to make sure the apartment computers understood she was addressing the door. ‚ÄúCome in Uncle Kaz.‚Äù

But over a decade ago, I was extremely insecure and depressed. Really, I should‚Äôve been institutionalized but we couldn‚Äôt afford it. I had no friends and craved any sort of attention I could get because I felt so invisible and isolated. 

Horrible thing to feel as you‚Äôre dissecting a cat in anatomy class. The class got to pick their own groups. The popular, sports, band kids all made their own groups. Us leftovers got put in a group together. These people were loners like me. So I wanted to do anything possible to make myself seem funny and likable so that maybe they would be my friend. 

As we‚Äôre dissecting the cat, I got the bright idea to joke that I‚Äôd eat the cat‚Äôs heart if someone went for coffee with me at lunch. I cringe so deeply at it now. But I thought it would make people want to hang out with me. Though that now makes no sense. 

The people in my group were not cheering me on as intended. Really, they were grossed out. But I thought that I would make them laugh if I just did it. So I did. I took the cat‚Äôs fermented heart and swallowed it. 

My group awkwardly chuckled. Some yelled ‚Äúno way that‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù And I took that as encouragement. I got attention and maybe would be able to snag some friends as a now proven jokester. 

Except, the group of popular girls saw it and filmed it. Posted it on Twitter at the time. Everyone at my school of over 1000 students could not see me eating a cat‚Äôs heart. I was relentlessly bullied afterwards. Which, in some ways makes total sense. And in other ways, wow it made my life a living hell and had the total opposite effect I was hoping for. 

I was left with so much shame and guilt that I had done that. I also suffered digestive issues for weeks after. My desperation for any sort of human connection made me reckless, annoying, and gross. And now everyone knew. 

Even though this happened a decade ago I still am haunted by it. I feel disgusted I did that. But I also feel really bad for 13 year old me that hated myself so much that I would do something so stupid. I was so depressed and insecure, yearning for anyone to talk to, that I made such a stupid choice. It makes me sad to think about. 

But I have done a lot of mental work since then. I am over a decade free of animal organs. I will not personality prostitute myself to find a friend. And I‚Äôm on the right psychiatric meds to make sane decisions. ",17,1748241497.0,offmychest,8,0.84,False
1kvnmao,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kvnmao/turin_legato_vs_gaggia_classic_pro_e24_on_sale_500/,Turin Legato vs Gaggia Classic Pro E24 (on sale)? [$500],"Hi,

We‚Äôre considering upgrading our espresso machine. When we got into espresso about 3.5 years ago, we took the advice from this sub and many others to invest in the grinder first (we still have a Niche Zero that we love - even tho I know it‚Äôs not as popular at this point). Our machine is a (don‚Äôt laugh) KitchenAid that‚Äôs kind of like a Breville Bambino but it‚Äôs starting to act up a bit. We drink mostly long black/americanos with cream with occasional frothed milk drinks, and in the summer I also make iced coffee using our machine. Also, we lean towards darker roasts and some medium. I‚Äôve tried a few light roasts but haven‚Äôt yet fallen in love with them - maybe it‚Äôs because we drink with cream. We pull 2-5 drinks per day. 

I‚Äôd love some advice. Currently looking at the Turin Legato vs the GCP E24. Obviously, the Legato is pretty stacked with features for the price but I am worried about longevity, especially hearing that some folks have had issues right out of the box. Also, no parts listed yet on EspressoOutlet under the parts section. I don‚Äôt know if it will ever be repairable. And while I love the functionality of a separate thermoblock for steaming milk, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of bare aluminium with hot water. I‚Äôve had an order for the Legato at $399 on hold for awhile (given the stock fluctuations), and I‚Äôm just no longer sure I want to go this direction.

On the other hand, Gaggia machines are well built, definitely repairable, and are known to last. With the current sale (I think the colors are $50 off so $499 now) plus an additional $50 off for Memorial Day sale, it seems a decent price. I don‚Äôt want an aluminium or coated boiler so the brass in the E24 is intriguing and from what Lance Hedrick said, the brass boiler is a little larger than the aluminum and therefore has better thermal stability out of the box. I love that this is a classic, has loads of mod options, not an appliance, and I‚Äôm strongly tempted by the mods like Gaggimate or Gaggiuino.

I‚Äôve searched here and am surprised to see fewer posts about the Legato (and sister units from MiiCoffee, Gemilai, etc) than I would have expected, given its features/price ratio. Has this model has not been as popular as expected or do you think there is concern about longevity or something else?

A few other things: we‚Äôre in the US, we have somewhat limited counter space. While not an expert, I also no longer feel like a novice. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts. Thanks so much in advance!",1,1748241302.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

I always sit in the same spot: a seat by the window on the second car, two rows from the back. It's not assigned or anything, but let me tell you, there's this weird satisfaction and comfort knowing it's ""my"" spot. One day, I got on and someone else was sitting there. I could feel my inner toddler throwing a tantrum, even tho I know it's totally irrational. I ended up sitting like, three rows away, sulking over my coffee. üòÇ

Turns out, this isn't just me being a weirdo. Psychologically, it's tied to our innate need for territoriality. It's kinda like how animals mark their territory, but for us, it's about creating a personalized space in a shared environment. We feel secure and familiar with certain spots, which makes us attach to them emotionally, even if it's all in our heads. And when someone else claims our ""territory,"" it triggers a little territorial defense mechanism. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

So next time you're stalking your favorite cafe table or lecture hall seat, just know you're not alone in this bizarre, territorial routine. Humans are creatures of habit, I guess!",4,1748240770.0,brainBehaves,0,1.0,False
1kvnh5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoGhoul/comments/1kvnh5l/newbies_review_on_first_volume/,Newbies review on first volume,"So I made a post a few hours ago asking people to ask me questions about Tokyo ghoul, and I'd reply and pretend I knew what I was talking about. Some people suggested I read the Manga then post my reactions so here it is!

I'm pretty sure the first volume chapters go from 0-9, so excuse me if I'm wrong lol

Anyways, that was a LOT better than I thought it was going to be tbh. I was invested af and was very intrigued about the plot, characters, and learning about Ghouls with Kaneki (poor boy.)

I feel bad for Kaneki already, especially with him not being able to eat human food properly again, like C'MON?? DUDES GONNA MISS OUT ON SM!! I could never. But seriously I love the internal struggle of having to choose between being a ghoul and a human, and trying to find a sense of belonging in a place which you feel you don't belong. It's a good analogy to what some people feel in the real world, and a good message to portray, especially after that old guy said that Kaneki belonged in both worlds instead of neither.

Kaneki being a bookworm makes me love him btw, like he was referencing Franz Kafka's metamorphosis with him transforming into a Ghoul, like how the MC of the book transforms into a bug, right??? I've been meaning to read Kafka's works, and am a bit of a literary nerd (or becoming one) and I LOVE him for referencing different books. ALSO IN MY POST, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS FOR THE BOOK HE WAS OBSESSED WITH, AND NOT BOOK HE REFERENCED, I LITERALLY GUESSED FRANZ KAFKA!!!! SO YEAH LETS GO KANEKI!!! I LOVE YOU ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°

Also I may or may not have searched up Sen takatsuki to see if it was a real book and perchance got spoilers? I'm unsure myself? Imma pretend that never happened, but anyways I like the book Kaneki is obsessed with as well, it's seems very obscure and I want to know more that happens in it lol. Especially with the name ""Egg of the black goat."" Once he explained where the meaning came from it made a lot more sense tho, and I loved the symbolism of it. There's lots of references to the book so I hope it keeps on being significant in the future!

Coffee. All of them, ADDICTS! I tell you. The author was probably jacked on coffee making this and was probably just like, ""why don't I just make all of them coffee addicts?"" Honestly, I'm here for it.

Nishiki, for the amount of times you call others an  asshole, you sure are one yourself üòí
Uh, but yeah I get he's an antagonist, but I understand all his motives for things and don't hate him. He just wants territory and food, so go gettem ig? (Bro keeps on getting WRECKED by Touka though lmao, that loser.) 
Also ngl I thought Nishiki was an old lady at first, and not a college guy üò≠

I don't have a strong opinion on Touka yet, I kind of want to learn about her character more before I make any judgements, but she seems cool and good for her for saving Kaneki so many times? Even if she was jealous that Kaneki got to live the life of a humans, she still saved him so yay!

Another thing about the story. I love that there's always SOME form of foreshadowing for future events. Like, it makes it extremely predictable for me, but I'd be more mad if there wasn't foreshadowing, and it makes sense for the plot as well. It's always small subtle details too, like Rize and Kaneki talking about their blood type, Rize going to the washroom after a small bite of her sandwich, other examples that I'm sure are there, etc. Everything's thought out and it's not just random surprises.

Oh yeah, human transplant thing. Can doctors straight up do that??? I get that the conference is on his ass but I feel like he'd be fired or go to jail??? Hello??? I mean I'd give him a trophy for saving Kaneki (even if it did turn him into a half ghoul) but still that's lowkey crazy that he just did that. Props to him for saving a life, not many could make that decision.

Again, poor Kaneki for the whole Rize incident. He thought he was getting a taste of life, but turns out Rize was one the one taking a taste of his life, and now look where he's ended up! You can't eat your poor American style steak burger thing ever again ü•∫

And am I losing it or in chapter 0, Touka had no clue Kaneki was a Ghoul and I swear their personalities reversed. I'm not tweaking am I? There's a reason for that right? Was that just supposed to be an introduction to everything or...? I might be being stupid but uh yeah, just a bit confused heh.

ANYHOW! There's probably things I have missed but overall I am LOVING it so far and can't wait to see where the plot goes and how Kaneki's character will develop. I probably missed some things and or wrote some misinformation in here so apologies, but I tried my best! Gonna return to reading now so see y'all :)

I swear I'm going crazy. Of course, by how things are going lately, nobody would agree. Nobody ever agrees, or calls me out on anything I'm doing anymore. And I've tried, believe me. Good lord how I've tried.

Let's start at the beginning. My name is Raymond, I live in San Clemente, California, and I can do no wrong. Sounds egotistical, right? What a stuck up, obnoxious, self-assured piece of shit, right? No, you probably *don't* think that. You probably think I'm a paragon of virtue, a blameless man, a saint on Earth, because *everybody does.* I'm praying you people will call me out on this. On *anything* I've done.

It all began with a speeding ticket. I drive to music, you know, to make the trip go by faster. I was on my way to work, idly humming along to ""Machinehead"" by Bush, when I saw the red-and-blue lights in the rear view. A quick glance at the speedometer told me I'd been going 88 in a 75. Pretty cut-and-dry, I was in the wrong. So I pulled over, rolling my eyes, cursing my fate, waiting for some badge to waddle on up to the window and ask for my license, registration, and probably my immigration papers despite the fact that I was born in fucking Connecticut. Just how these sorts of things always go for me.

I waited and sure enough, some highway trooper in fatigues sidles on up, taking his sweet time, and leans over the driver-side window. Guy looked like a peeled potato with a mustache and a pair of reflective aviators, and I could tell what he was going to say the moment he saw my face.

""Hablo english?"" He asked in something not even approaching proper pronunciation of Spanish. *Hah-blo English.* The last person to speak Spanish as a first language in my family was my Abuelo, and he married a woman who'd been here for a generation. What I'm trying to say is, this racist piece-of-shit cop probably genuinely spoke more Spanish than I did, and even *then*, he spoke it like shit.

""Yes, officer, I speak English,"" I said through clenched teeth. He looked genuinely taken aback, like I'd just answered in Mandarin.

""Uh, right. Right. Well, you know how fast you were goin', son?""

*Son*. They always say *son*. Or *honey*, if you're a woman.

""Nope, officer. Not a clue,"" I quipped, unable to keep the annoyance from entering my tone.

""Oh, okay. Well, if you look at the gauge on the dash, there's a number that tells you how fast you're going in miles per hour. That number shouldn't exceed the one on the white sign you passed, or else you're breaking the law.""

I looked at him with open contempt, but he stared back at me with a dumbstruck, genuine expression.

""I know how a speedometer works, dude.""

""Good! That's good. Well, everything seems to be in order. You have a swell day.""

I blinked, taken aback. The officer was already turning away, walking towards his car. I sat there waiting for him to come back up with cuffs, or a clipboard, or to actually *do his job*, but to my utter shock he just drove off. He hadn't even seen my license. No ticket, no altercation, nothing. I was dumbfounded. It was so bizarre I looked around for a hidden camera or something to see if I was getting punked. Nothing. People just drove past me on the side of the road, and I pulled out and drove off, this time at the speed limit.

I would have chalked that up to a very, very weird interaction had it not been for the first thing that happened when I set foot in the office. See, I work at a healthcare office as a receptionist; when we go in, we swipe our ID card and do a quick Covid screen (despite it being, what, five years since the pandemic), then we sit down and help clients. When I went to drop my bag off in the employee area, however, I was careless and I knocked directly into one of my co-workers, who had been holding a cup of scalding-hot coffee. Now I'm a tall guy, so while she bumped into around my collarbone, her coffee went high and hit her right across the face.

She screamed, the most terrible scream I'd heard in my entire life. Steam gushed from the sizzling flesh as  her eyelids blistered. Desperately I tore at my jacket and tried to wipe the liquid off but she was writhing and clawing at her sockets like a madwoman. Blood began to dribble as her nails tore through the flesh of her face. Finally thinking like an *adult* for once, I called for help from other staff and rushed over to the sink to wet down a cloth with cold water. Two other people came running and immediately grabbed the first aid kit I'd ignored in my panic.

""What happened?!"" Someone asked as she finally began to stop squirming. White pustules had broken out across her eyelids and deep red gouges where she'd tried to get the searing liquid from her face ran warm blood down her cheeks. As they tended to her, accusatory eyes fell on me and I stammered out an explanation.

""S-sorry, oh my god, sorry! Fuck, it was my fault, I turned the corner and she was there and-""

""*You stupid BITCH!*"" My manager roared, so loud it echoed back into the lobby, and his foot cracked directly into her ribs. *CRACK.* Spittle flew from his lips and his eyes bulged from a face the color of overcooked pork as he ranted incoherently at her.

""What the hell?!"" I yelped, pulling him off her. His face was a manic rictus of inhuman rage and he spat at the weeping woman over my shoulder before turning to face me.

It was like a switch flipped, and the color drained from his face in a rush. Jack was not a pleasant man, but I'd never heard him raise his voice, and certainly never seen him act in violence against anyone. The shrieking monster bled away and Jack smiled at me in an avuncular sort of way.

""Raymond! So sorry you had to see that. You're not hurt, are you?""

""Hurt?! No, *I'm* not hurt, but Susan-""

""-will be disciplined properly, I promise. I can't believe how careless she was!""

Someone tending to her smacked her across the face as she wept.

""What the fuck?! No, it was *my* fault, not Susan's! What are you doing?""

""N-no... I d-deserve it...""

I turned to see Susan sitting up, blood and pus running down her abused cheeks. Her eyes were shut tight and the others were holding her arms back as if to restrain her.

""I d-deserve it..."" She whimpered, and nobody spoke.

""No! No, you don't! What the fuck is going on? I made a mistake, it was *me*, not her! She needs help!""

Jack snorted derisively.

""You shouldn't defend her, Ray. She'll lose her job for this, I'll make sure of it.""

""No! Absolutely not, what the hell?""

The inhuman rage bled back into Jack's face and he started towards her.

""You hear me, *bitch?!* You're *done!* You're fucking *through!* Get your shit, and get the *fuck-""*

I did the only thing I could do. I punched Jack. It was an awkward, shaky swing that grazed his ear and barely connected. It was pure panic; at that moment, I felt like if I didn't stop him, he would *kill* her.

The effect was instantaneous. The crowd gathered around Susan stopped restraining her and immediately moved to restrain Jack. They forced him to his knees and put him in an arm lock, while Susan staggered to her feet. She was blind and I caught her before she could stumble.

""Jack, what the hell is wrong? It was an accident! And it was *my* fault!""

Jack shook his head in bewilderment.

""I- I-..."" He stammered, and tears glistened in his eyes.

""I'm so sorry, Ray. I'm so very sorry.""

""Don't apologize to *me*! Apologize to *her!*""

He looked at her blankly, his eyes barely focusing on her.

""Susan? Why?""

""You kicked her in the ribs, you fucking psycho!""

Susan sniffled. Security had arrived and the paramedics had been called, thank god. The officers put Jack in cuffs and led him towards the back door.

""We've got him now, Ray. And someone will look after Susan. Why don't you take the rest of the day off? We'll get someone to fill.""

I nodded, still shell-shocked by the turn of events. Without further comment I headed out into the parking lot towards my car. I got in and just sat there, staring blankly at the dashboard. It felt like a dream.

A sudden crack jolted me out of my daze and I looked up towards the alley. One of the security officers holstered his service weapon and was talking with his fellows.

They'd executed Jack in the alley.

(Apparently this doesn't fit the ""vibe"" of r/nosleep. I disagree, but since it's their platform, I will respect their wishes.)",1,1748240688.0,u_EncyclicalUnderpass,0,1.0,False
