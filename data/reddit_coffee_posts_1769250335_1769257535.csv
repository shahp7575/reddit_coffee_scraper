1qllnzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultKids/comments/1qllnzk/talk_with_older_sister_went_as_expected/,Talk with older sister went as expected,"My (31f) older sister (33f) messaged me a few weeks ago after several years of no contact. She wanted to see if we could reconcile. In the texts she did give me a few hints that it might be doable so I said yes and we met for a coffee today.

Last night I suddenly felt; ‘oh no. I think I shouldn’t have done this.’ Because I feel like what I need from her is something she can’t give me. I needed her to apologize how she acted at my wedding and bachelor party (which is why we broke contact). It was already rocky before that, but since she couldn’t prioritize or respect me on my wedding, I realized she never would. 

Long story short; she blamed everything on being ‘in a bad place’. She never uttered the word sorry or anything similar. 

She felt I ‘punished’ her for not having her at the table with me and my husband. I tried explaining to her that I needed to feel safe and celebrated and that her behavior at the bachelor party showed me she couldn’t and that for once in my life I chose my own happiness. 

The convo ended because she got too anxious and said she can’t do this. That she can’t give me what I need. So I said; well, thanks for trying. And we parted. 

Disappointed and a little sad, but not surprised. Obviously a lot more was said but I figured I’d keep the post short. 

Anyone else have issues with their siblings? Have you tried to reconcile? How did that go? ",1,1769257454.0,EstrangedAdultKids,1,1.0,False
1qllnta,https://i.redd.it/qbqx097qiafg1.jpeg,Entitled customer sa umaga,"This was last week. Skl.

I went to Asian Hospital to accompany my mother for her ct scan. While waiting, I went to Cafe France downstairs and had coffee. Maaga pa that time, I think roughly past 8 in the morning.

In the middle of my solo coffee sesh, biglang may customer na tumalak, diagonal from my table. Dahil wala masyado customers that time na pwede mag-block sa line of sight ko sa irate customer na yun, kitang-kita ko kung pano sya gumalaw like gestures nya habang tumatalak. 

Non-verbatim pero ang reklamo nya ay ang tagal na daw nya tinatawag yung isang staff pero di daw sya pinapansin. Ipapa-take out daw nya yung tira nyang food. Tapos naglecture na sya na kesyo ganun ba sila magsilbi sa customers? Etc.

Then pumitik tenga ko nung sinabe nya na “I’m a doctor…” hindi ko na matandaan yung iba pa nyang sinabe basta in summary, minamaliit na nya yung staff porke di daw sya pinapansin at doctor nga daw sya.

I saw na the others are busy sa mga new deliveries kasi may mga boxes na ini-inventory yung iba na nasa may entrance banda. 

Then si irate customer biglang dinamay yung katabi nyang table na wala ng customers pero may mga plates and utensils pa ng previous customers na nakaupo dun. Meaning di pa lang nalilinis ng staffs din. Sinama yun ni irate “doctor” na bakit daw hindi pa nililinis. Yung totoo manang, doctor ka ba talaga o mayordoma? Pati ibang table dinamay na talaga sa issue nya.

Then pinatawag nya yung manager at kumuda kuda pa din. Same sa mga pinagsasabi nya sa isang staff. 

Mejo more than an hour din ako dun tumambay and after makuha ni irate doctor yung takeout nya, tumambay pa din sya dun. Hindi sya naka-doctor uniform. Mukang not an Asian Hospital doctor too. Overheard lng sa 2 pa nyang kasama dun sa cafe dahil ang lalakas ng mga boses na may inaantay lang yung kasama nya na result at mukang sumama lang sya. 

Then nung mag-bill out na ako, yung male staff na tinatalakan nung irate doctor ang nag-abot sa akin ng bill. He looked stressed. Obviously dahil sa nangyari. Sinabi ko na lang na wag na nya pansinin yung mukang mangkukulam. Mejo narininig nung isang staff tapos tumawa kasi naglilinis sya ng table sa left side ko. 

Anyway, why can’t people just be nice? Kung totoong doctor ka man manang, kaylangan talaga ipamuka mo yun at new year na wala ka pa ding pinagkatandaan? Hay.",1,1769257441.0,CasualPH,0,1.0,False

**Location:** The White House, Washington D.C.

**Date:** First Contact Day + 1 Hour

The transition from the sterile, bio-filtered atmosphere of the *Gilded Talon* to the interior of the human command structure was a sensory assault.

As the doors hissed shut behind them, sealing away the humid outdoor air, Stormfly expected relief. She didn't get it. The climate control system of the ""White House"" was primitive—a forced-air circulation system that did little to scrub particulate matter. To Stormfly’s refined olfactory sensors, the air tasted of stale cellulose, harsh chemical cleaning agents, and beneath it all, the omnipresent, cloying scent of the small apex predators inhabiting the structure.

It was a smell of salt, iron, and secreted oils. It clung to the back of her throat, thick and greasy.

""This way, Ambassador,"" Astrid Hofferson said, gesturing down a wide hallway lined with red carpeting.

Stormfly hesitated for a fraction of a second before stepping onto the fabric. To a Nadari, the sensation was revolting. The floor was covered in a fibrous weave that trapped dust, dead skin cells, and microscopic mites. It felt like walking on a flattened, preserved pelt. 

""Your dwelling is… textured,"" Stormfly commented, her voice translator smoothing out the sharp click of her beak into a polite observation.

""It’s a historic building,"" Astrid explained, matching Stormfly’s pace. The human’s stride was short, choppy, and inefficient compared to the gliding gait of the Nadari. ""It’s served as the residence for our leaders for over two centuries.""

Stormfly glanced at the walls. They were lined with static, two-dimensional pigment representations of past leaders. Dozens of pale, unarmored faces stared down at her.

*They capture their history in oil and canvas,* she mused, her vertical pupils dilating to analyze the brushstrokes. *Static. Dead. No holographic memory-crystals. No genetic lineage totems. They honor their dead by hanging their likenesses in dark corridors.*

""Impressive,"" Stormfly lied smoothly.

She walked in the center of the hallway, her personal guard flanking her. The Kkor-Gath were visibly agitated. Their eyes, capable of seeing into the ultraviolet spectrum, were twitching erratically. The heat signatures of the humans were likely overwhelming them; to a Kkor-Gath, a human looked like a walking, pulsing beacon of thermal energy.

Behind them scurried Click-Clack, the Tik-Tik data-runner. The small, gecko-like Dragon was clutching a chrome briefcase to his chest as if it were a shield. He was hyperventilating, his small throat pouch fluttering rapidly.

""Keep formation,"" Stormfly hissed in the low-frequency command tongue. ""Do not act like prey, Click-Clack. You are a member of the Delegation. Walk with pride.""

""The walls are vibrating,"" Click-Clack squeaked back, his eyes darting to the electrical sconces. ""Alternating current. Sixty hertz. It buzzes in my teeth, Mistress.""

""Ignore it.""

They reached the end of the hall, where double doors were thrown open by two humans in dress uniforms. They stood rigid, but Stormfly could smell the spike in their cortisol levels—the sharp, acrid scent of fear.

The room beyond was cavernous by human standards, but to a dragon, it felt like a cage. The ceiling was low, heavy with plaster molding and crystal chandeliers that looked fragile and dangerous. The floor had been cleared of furniture, leaving a vast expanse of polished wood, but the perimeter was lined with bodies.

Dozens of dignitaries. Generals in decorated jackets. Politicians in dark suits. And, most concerning of all, the Media.

A phalanx of humans stood behind a velvet rope, holding optical devices—cameras with massive glass lenses that looked uncomfortably like the targeting scopes of a railgun.

*They are staring,* Stormfly realized, her head spines smoothing down tight against her neck—a defensive reflex. *Not with reverence, but with hunger. We are the spectacle.*

""Ambassador,"" a human male spoke up from a podium at the far end. He was older, his skin loose around the jowls, his hair a thinning grey thatch. ""I am the President of the United States. On behalf of humanity, we are honored.""

Stormfly approached, stopping exactly four meters from the podium—the optimal strike distance for a Nadari, and therefore the polite diplomatic distance for a non-aggressor. She dipped her head, a calculated incline of the neck.

""The Dragonic Alliance acknowledges your greeting, President,"" she said. ""We come in the spirit of… categorization and cooperation.""

The negotiations began.

It was a tedious, grinding dance of logistics. Stormfly had participated in the uplift of three other species, but those had been aquatic or reptilian. There was a shared biological framework. Here, every simple request became a xenobiological hurdle.

""We have prepared housing at Edwards Air Force Base,"" Astrid Hofferson said, pointing to a digital map displayed on a screen. ""It is a desert environment. We assumed, based on your thermal readings, you would prefer an arid climate.""

""Arid is acceptable,"" Stormfly agreed. ""The Grom suffers from fungal blooms in high humidity. However, the atmospheric pressure is low. We will need to deploy localized gravity-stabilizers.""

""That can be arranged,"" Astrid noted, scribbling on a notepad. ""And regarding sustenance? We have arranged for livestock—cattle, sheep—""

Stormfly’s head snapped up. ""Livestock?""

""For food,"" the President clarified, looking confused. ""We assumed… as apex predators…""

""We do not consume mammals,"" Stormfly said, her voice dropping an octave, the translator struggling to convey the depth of her revulsion without being insulting. ""The protein structures are incompatible. Prions. Complex lipids. And… the texture is unappealing. We synthesize our nutrient paste, or we hunt piscine lifeforms from certified sterile oceans.""

""Fish,"" the President repeated. ""We have plenty of fish.""

""We will require sample testing,"" Stormfly interjected quickly. ""Your oceans contain high levels of mercury and micro-plastics. We cannot ingest them unfiltered.""

The human generals exchanged glances. Stormfly could practically hear their thoughts: *High maintenance. Picky eaters.*

The hours dragged on. The room grew warmer as the sun beat against the windows and the body heat of fifty humans filled the stagnant air. Stormfly’s scales were beginning to itch beneath her ceremonial sash. She longed to be back on her ship, in the soothing, misty cold of the cryo-deck.

Click-Clack was suffering the worst. His metabolism was running hot, fueled by anxiety. He kept shifting from foot to foot, his tail wrapping around the leg of the nearest Kkor-Gath guard for comfort.

""Ambassador,"" a General interrupted, looking at his watch. ""The Press Pool has been patient. They are requesting a photo opportunity. No questions, just visuals.""

Stormfly stifled a sigh. ""Very well. But no strobes. Our visual spectrum is wider than yours; a high-intensity xenon flash is blinding to us.""

""Understood. No flash.""

The velvet ropes were lowered. The mob of photographers surged forward, their shutters clicking like a swarm of mechanical insects. *Click-whir. Click-whir. Click-whir.*

Stormfly struck a pose—head high, wings slightly flared to display the iridescent patterns of her plumage. It was a pose of power, meant to signal authority.

But one reporter, a man with a heavy camera and a boom microphone slung over his shoulder, wasn't looking at the majestic Nadari Ambassador. He was looking at the small, trembling creature hiding behind the massive guard.

He pushed past the line, stepping into the ""Diplomatic Zone.""

""Hey there, little guy,"" the reporter cooed. His voice dropped into the register humans used for their infants or domestic pets. He lowered his camera, leaning in dangerously close to Click-Clack. ""You're the only one not wearing armor. What are you? Some kind of scout?""

He reached out a hand. It was a gesture of curiosity, perhaps even kindness.

But to Click-Clack, it was a horror show.

The human loomed over him, baring his teeth in a ""smile."" The scent of the man was overwhelming—sweat, stale coffee, and the pheromones of a viviparous. The hand reaching out was huge, pink, and covered in fine, golden hairs. To the Tik-Tik, it looked like a giant, raw spider made of meat.

Click-Clack’s primitive brain stem overrode his training.

*SNAP.*

The sound was like a pistol crack in the quiet room. Click-Clack’s jaws flashed open, clamping on the air just inches from the reporter's fingers. A warning snap. A burst of green sparks—the ignition of magnesium gas—coughed out of his throat, singing the hair on the reporter's knuckles.

""BACK!"" Click-Clack screeched, his voice a series of high-pitched, barking yelps. He scrambled backward, his claws scrabbling on the polished wood, climbing halfway up the chitinous leg of the Kkor-Gath guard. ""DON'T TOUCH! DON'T TOUCH!""

Chaos erupted.

""Whoa!"" The reporter stumbled back, tripping over his own feet and crashing into a cameraman. ""Gun! He's got a gun!"" someone shouted, mistaking the magnesium sparks for a weapon discharge.

The Secret Service agents moved with terrifying speed. In a heartbeat, half a dozen handguns were drawn, laser sights painting ruby dots across the Kkor-Gath’s carapace.

The Kkor-Gath reacted not with fear, but with lethal, programmed efficiency.

*HISS-THUNK.*

Their stingers, thick as a human arm and tipped with translucent barbs, vaulted over their heads. They slammed the tips into the floor, not attacking, but anchoring themselves for a charge. Green venom dripped from the barbs, sizzling as it ate through the varnish and into the historic hardwood.

They stepped in front of Stormfly, their mandibles clicking a rapid-fire rhythm of war. *Protect. Protect. Sterilize the threat.*

""HOLD FIRE!"" Astrid Hofferson screamed. She threw herself in front of the lead agent, her arms spread wide. ""NOBODY SHOOT! STAND DOWN!""

""Target is aggressive!"" one of the agent yelled, his finger whitening on the trigger. ""It has a biological weapon!""

""It’s a warning!"" Astrid roared back, her voice cracking with desperation. ""Look at them! They aren't attacking, they're guarding! Put the weapons away!""

Stormfly flared her wings to their full, twenty-foot span. The displacement of air was violent, knocking a stack of papers off the podium and sending a wave of wind through the room.

""Venom! Pincer! Click-Clack*!*"" she barked in the command tongue. ""Hold position! Do not engage! Defensive formation only!""

For ten agonizing seconds, the two species stared at each other across the cultural abyss. The humans, sweating and trembling with fingers on triggers. The dragons, hissing and dripping acid, their alien eyes locked on the threats.

""Everyone out,"" Astrid ordered, her voice trembling with adrenaline but dropping to a dangerous, icy calm. She turned to the President. ""Sir, please clear the room. I want the press gone. I want the agents to the perimeter. Leave us.""

""Astrid..."" the President warned.

""Now, sir. Unless you want an interstellar war start because a photographer wanted a close-up.""

It took two minutes of shouting, shuffling, and door-slamming, but the room was finally cleared. The heavy oak doors were shut and locked.

Only Astrid, two senior Generals who refused to leave, Stormfly, her guards, and the trembling Click-Clack remained.

The silence was heavy. The smell of ozone and acid  hung in the air.

Astrid turned to Stormfly. The human woman was pale, her chest heaving. She took a deep breath, smoothing her suit jacket with trembling hands, forcing herself to regain composure.

""Ambassador,"" Astrid said, her tone dangerously quiet. ""We need to talk. Now.""

Stormfly slowly folded her wings, though she kept her posture rigid. She used the tip of her tail to gently nudge Click-Clack, who was shivering violently behind her legs.

""My apologies, Ambassador Hofferson,"" Stormfly said, her voice stiff. ""The Tik-Tik are… a high-strung caste. Your citizen violated the proximity zone. It was a reflex.""

""He leaned in,"" Astrid countered, stepping closer. ""He didn't attack. He treated your associate like a child, or a pet. It was ignorant, yes. Stupid? Absolutely. But that reaction? That wasn't defense, Stormfly. That was panic.""

Astrid ignored the Kkor-Gath, who bristled and clicked their mandibles as she approached. She looked Stormfly dead in the eye.

""I've been watching you for the last two hours,"" Astrid said. ""You're not just alert. You're revolted.""

Stormfly stiffened.

""Every time we hand you a document, you hold your breath,"" Astrid listed, ticking points off on her fingers. ""When the President offered you water, you looked at the glass like it was poison. When I shook your hand outside, I felt your pulse spike. You looked like you wanted to peel your own skin off.""

Stormfly remained silent, her golden eyes unblinking, the nictitating membranes flicking across them rapidly.

""If we are going to be allies,"" Astrid pressed, her voice rising, ""or even neighbors, I need to know what the hell is going on. Is it political? Is it religious? Did we offend some obscure custom of yours?""

Stormfly looked at the human woman. She looked at the soft, pinkish skin of her face. She saw the microscopic beads of sweat forming on Astrid’s upper lip. She smelled the iron-rich blood pumping beneath the translucent dermis.

Honesty. The Noktus had demanded honesty. *Do not let them believe we are conquerors. Let them know why we keep our distance.*

""It is not political,"" Stormfly said softly. The translator conveyed the deep, melancholy resonance of her chest cavity. ""And it is not an insult to your character, Ambassador. You have conducted yourself with honor.""

""Then what is it?""

Stormfly sighed, a rattling, hissing sound that vibrated through the floorboards. She signaled her guards to stand down completely. They retracted their stingers, though they continued to watch the Generals.

""You are… mammalian,"" Stormfly said.

Astrid blinked, confused. ""Yes. We are. And?""

""In the Alliance,"" Stormfly began, choosing her words with extreme care, ""there are over forty sapient species. Some breathe water. Some breathe methane. Some are made of silicon and living rock. But… with no exception... we are all hatched.""

She paced a small circle, her talons clicking rhythmically on the wood.

""We come from eggs. We emerge formed. Clean. Hard. Our biological fluids are contained. We shed our skins in dry, sterile husks. We are distinct from the chaotic biological processes of the lower orders.""

She stopped and looked directly at Astrid.

""We have encountered non-sapient mammals on other worlds. Vermin. Livestock. Prey. To the Draconic eye, mammals are… chaotic biological engines. You breed rapidly. You are covered in oils, bacteria, and shedding follicles. You birth your young in a mess of blood and fluids and then let the young parasitize you for sustenance.""

The room was deadly silent. The human General’s jaw dropped. Astrid just stared.

""You find us… gross?"" Astrid asked. The absurdity of the word seemed to hang in the air, warring with the gravity of the interstellar crisis.

""We find you… difficult to process,"" Stormfly corrected. ""Viscerally. Instinctually. To a Nadari, interacting with a human is like… imagine if you met a sapient colony of giant, wet slugs.""

Astrid recoiled slightly.

""Slugs,"" Stormfly continued, mercilessly. ""Slugs that wanted to shake your hand. Slugs that built cities and spaceships and fusion reactors, yes, but still… slimy, soft, porous slugs that leave a trail of thermal energy and biological shedding wherever they go.""

Stormfly shivered, her spines rattling involuntarily at the mental image.

""When your reporter approached the Tik-Tik… Click-Clack did not see a curious intellectual. He saw a massive, sweating, warm-blooded mammal baring its teeth. He smelled the hormones leaking from its skin. He didn't snap because he was angry, Ambassador. He snapped because his brain screamed that he was about to be touched by a monster.""

Stormfly lowered her head, meeting Astrid’s eyes with a look of genuine plea.

""We are trying, Ambassador Hofferson. Truly. The High Court recognizes your intelligence. We respect your technology. But you must understand… you are the first of your kind to reach the stars. We have no frame of reference for you. We are fighting millions of years of evolutionary programming that tells us you are… unclean.""

The silence that followed was heavy, broken only by the hum of the air conditioning.

Astrid stared at Stormfly. She looked down at her own hands—pale, soft, flexible. She touched her own face. She looked at the Generals, who were sweating profusely in their uniforms.

""So,"" Astrid said, a dry, humorless laugh escaping her lips. ""You don't want to conquer us. You don't want to steal our resources. You just want to… sanitize us?""

""We would prefer to conduct diplomacy from a distance,"" Stormfly admitted. ""Or through environmental suits. The physical contact… the handshake… it was a gesture of extreme willpower on my part. I am currently suppressing the urge to bathe in ammonia.""

One of the Generals scoffed, stepping forward. ""This is ridiculous. We’re negotiating with space germaphobes. They’re afraid of a little sweat? We should be offended.""

""General, shut up,"" Astrid snapped, not looking away from the dragon. She took a step back, clasping her hands behind her back. She straightened her spine.

""Okay,"" Astrid said. ""That’s… honest. Brutally honest. But I can work with honest.""

She gave a formal nod—no touching.

""We will enforce a perimeter,"" Astrid stated professionally. ""No physical contact. We will keep the temperature in the meeting rooms lower to minimize… perspiration. And we will keep the press at a distance. If your people need environmental suits to tolerate us, we won't take offense.""

""That would be appreciated,"" Stormfly said, her posture relaxing visibly.

""But,"" Astrid added, her voice hardening into steel. ""You will have to get used to us, Stormfly. We aren't going to stop being mammals. We aren't going to stop sweating, and we aren't going to hatch from eggs. We are wet, we are soft, and we are loud. If this Alliance is going to work, you’re going to have to learn to look at us without vomiting.""

Stormfly chittered—a draconic laugh that sounded like grinding stones. ""A fair condition, Ambassador. I will endeavor to keep my crop contents internal.""

""Good."" Astrid pointed to the doors. ""Now, let’s go back out there. We’re going to tell the cameras that it was a misunderstanding caused by an equipment malfunction. We don't need the world knowing that the aliens think we have cooties.""

""Cooties?"" Stormfly asked, tilting her head, her spines raising in curiosity. ""I do not know this term. Is it a parasite?""

""I'll explain it later,"" Astrid sighed, rubbing her temples. ""After I take a very, very long shower.""

As the humans moved to reopen the doors, Stormfly felt a strange sensation in her chest. It wasn't disgust. It was… intrigue.

The mammal was soft. She was repulsive. She was leaking thermal energy. But she did not back down. She stood before a Kkor-Gath executioner and did not flinch.

*Perhaps,* Stormfly thought as she watched Astrid march back towards the media circus, *the Noktus was right. There is iron beneath that doughy skin.*",1,1769257162.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

If you’re thinking of escaping the city for 3–4 days, here are a few budget-friendly and realistic options (especially if you’re working in a metro):

**From Delhi / NCR:**  
• Rishikesh – chill vibes, river rafting, peaceful evenings  
• Jaipur – heritage, food, and easy travel  
• Mussoorie / Dehradun – great weather + scenic views

**From Mumbai:**  
• Lonavala / Matheran – quick hill escape  
• Goa – surprisingly affordable if booked early  
• Alibaug – perfect for a relaxed beach break

**From Bangalore:**  
• Coorg – coffee estates + nature  
• Chikmagalur – peaceful and less crowded  
• Pondicherry – beach + cafés

**From Chennai / Hyderabad:**  
• Pondicherry  
• Yercaud  
• Hampi (for history lovers)

💡 **Pro tip:**  
Book trains/flights early, travel light, and avoid overpacking your itinerary. Republic Day weekend gets crowded fast, so early planning = less stress + better deals.

He contributed to making my life worse back in middle school when I was already going through a lot of shit at home. We switched schools in high school and we reconnected at a friend's party years later and I believed that people change and he probably did too since now we are all adults. Well, this guy even as an adult was bullying others, some of them were my friends, he even made a joke at my expense which I brushed off and I made a passive aggressive comment back too. He really ruined the party for all of us but he was a good friend of the organizer of the party so we tolerated him till we all left.

Almost 6 years later, I see a beautiful girl while scrolling linkedin with the same last name as his in my recommendations and It didn't click until I dived deep that she is this guys' sister. She is a couple years older. I never even knew he had a sister but since know I knew. I being petty for all the stuff in the past, found her Instagram and I messaged her. We started talking and I asked her out on a coffee date and she agreed. We had a short first coffee date, then we had a second date, it was a movie date and we got really close during it.

As I got to know her, I learnt she is completely opposite to his brother. She is very kind and caring. We are very close to making things official but I have a lot of weird feelings about this. I do like the girl, she is amazing but I also know that the only reason I even went out of my way to text her is because she is that guy's sister and it is making me feel like a bad person. Me and his brother have a lot of history, we even had a lot of fights when I finally started making friends in school and gained some courage. Eventually things will come out and of course I can deny having any knowledge about their connection altogether.

Don't tell me to come clean because I can't, it's either I break things with her and move on or we continue this until the final expose and I will just deny having any prior knowledge of this. I really can't hurt her now. My feelings for her are genuine but they started with the wrong intent.",1,1769256904.0,AITAH,8,0.6,False

But from the sides i look like a barrel, totally pulling my confidence down. Are there any shortcuts like dry intermittent fasting? I even did OMAD and 2 36 HR fasting/week, but nothing seemed to work. Fasting in 36 hours, I did for one month, and the regular fasting I do 16 is to 8, the 18 is to 6 mostly. I don't indulge in a lot of unhealthy or junk food, I take is home cooked meals as we have a cook at home. I won't take rice more half the time, which makes it just the vegetables, fish, chicken, and three eggs with one full egg, I occasionally indulge in chocolates. I don't take sugar in my coffee. 

Now I'm looking to lose weight, so I've also started doing Carolyn Girvan's Iron series and also trying to do 10,000 steps or most days I get 5,000 steps. Can I ask you a flatter side view in one to three months? If yes, what can the routine be? If you've seen success in getting a flatter side view, let me know in the comments.

1qlldwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/InfiniteContent/comments/1qlldwj/what_is_spray_dried_milk_powder_process_quality/,"What Is Spray Dried Milk Powder? Process, Quality, and Storage Guide","Spray dried milk powder is a versatile, shelf-stable dairy product made by transforming liquid milk into a fine powder through a high-speed drying process. This method not only extends the milk’s shelf life but also makes it easier to transport and store without refrigeration. It’s a smart solution for anyone looking to reduce food waste or enjoy the benefits of milk in a more convenient form.

The process starts by heating and pasteurizing fresh milk to kill any harmful bacteria. After that, the milk is concentrated through evaporation, which removes a significant amount of water content. The concentrated milk is then sprayed through a nozzle into a hot air chamber—this is where the magic happens. As the droplets of milk fall through the hot air, they dry almost instantly, turning into a fine, white powder. This quick drying preserves the nutritional value, taste, and color of the milk with minimal loss.

When it comes to quality, consistency is key. The spray drying process is designed to retain essential nutrients like protein, calcium, and vitamins while reducing moisture content to a safe level. This ensures the powder doesn’t spoil or clump when stored properly. A high-quality powder will dissolve easily in water, taste fresh, and have no off-putting odors. It’s used in everything from baby formula and baked goods to tea, coffee, and emergency food kits.

Now, let’s talk about storage. Because of its low moisture content, spray dried milk powder is remarkably shelf-stable. To keep it fresh, store it in an airtight container away from heat, light, and moisture. A cool, dry pantry is ideal. Once opened, it’s best to use it within a few weeks, but unopened packs can last for months—even years—without any loss in quality.

**Spray dried milk powder** is truly a modern-day staple for home cooks, travelers, and food producers alike. It’s an excellent source of nutrients, doesn’t require refrigeration, and offers all the goodness of milk with added convenience. Whether you’re baking a cake or prepping for emergencies, it deserves a spot in your pantry.",1,1769256573.0,InfiniteContent,0,1.0,False

I just shipped **v0.3.0**, and this release feels different because I didn't write the code for the new features manually. I used Formic v0.2 to build them.

**The ""Bootstrapping"" Milestone:** I wanted two major upgrades:

1. **A Task Queue:** So I don't have to baby-sit the agent.
2. **A Mobile Client:** So I can monitor agents from my phone while away from the keyboard.

Instead of coding this myself, I created the tickets in Formic v0.2. The agents picked up the tasks, modified the React frontend to add a PWA ""Tactical View,"" and implemented the Node.js queueing logic.

I essentially orchestrated the upgrade from my dashboard while the agents did the heavy lifting.

**New Feature: The ""Tactical"" Mobile Experience** Formic now detects when you are on a mobile device and switches to a specialized ""Command Center"" UI.

* **Tech:** It's a PWA (Progressive Web App). No App Store. No React Native.
* **Access:** I run it over **Tailscale**.
* **Workflow:** I can now define a task on my desktop, walk away, and watch the agent's terminal logs stream live to my phone via WebSocket while I'm making coffee or at the gym.

**New Feature: Automated Queueing** We removed the human bottleneck. You can now stack 10 tasks in the ""Todo"" column. The new **Task Manager Bot** monitors the lifecycle—as soon as one agent finishes, it spins up the next one automatically.

**The Stack:**

* **Runtime:** Node.js 20 + TypeScript
* **Backend:** Fastify (Async/Low Overhead)
* **State:** Local JSON File
* **Deploy:** Docker

Overall she’s very verbal, imaginative, polite, and emotionally aware, but her play at home looks very different from some other kids her age, and that’s what’s been making me question things.

At home, she often doesn’t play with her toys, especially if they’re familiar. She’ll wander around the house, move from room to room, and sometimes whine if no adult is nearby.. She doesn’t do much self-initiated independent play with the toys she already has. If nothing interesting is happening, she kind of drifts. 

That said, if a toy is new — like a new play kitchen or coffee stand — she can play alone for hours. In those moments she invents long storylines and stays deeply engaged. She doesn’t jump from toy to toy; she locks into one scenario and plays it out for a long time. Her attention seems very interest-based. She can’t focus long on things she’s not interested in, but she can focus for long stretches on things she likes, especially pretend play or role play. She can also follow instructions well whether she is tired or not 

Socially, she does very well. At playgroup she politely asks to join other kids, waits her turn, and shares toys when guided. She can engage in playgroup play for over an hour. She sometimes gets frustrated if peers don’t comply, but she usually regulates with words instead of melting down. She notices when others are sad or crying and even reacts emotionally to scenes in movies. She asks questions like “Mommy, have you been happy?” which shows a lot of awareness of others’ feelings.

She loves pretend play, especially things like doctor, shopkeeper, or café scenarios, and can do this for 30 minutes or more, or much longer with new setups. She can make up stories from picture books. She doesn’t like other kids touching her toys, but she can share when prompted.

Emotionally, she’s very regulated. She has never hit, kicked, or scratched when upset. When she’s frustrated or overwhelmed, she might shriek, tense her body, or say “I don’t like that,” but she doesn’t physically act out. She startles if toddlers approach her quickly and sometimes becomes physically tense when emotionally overloaded. She also shows a lot of impulse control — for example, she asks permission to get up from the table instead of just leaving.

She sleeps really well and never put a fight to go to bed ever . She eats a wide variety of foods, including vegetables and homemade meals. 

Developmentally, she’s very verbal and imaginative, emotionally regulated, empathetic, and socially aware. She can play very deeply when something captures her interest, but she has limited interest in familiar toys at home and tends to wander when she’s under-stimulated.",1,1769256184.0,HighlySensitiveChild,0,1.0,False

this is all because of my work and laptop screen.

i think I got the advanced version of burnout, 8 months of grinding, 10 hours daily.

and the worst thing? I can’t stop or rest. it’s my bread.

yeah I’m seeing good results in business, but in contrast, significant damage to my health.

I started understanding what hidden stress is, this is it. you are working, and you feel unwell and have difficulty breathing. you feel swelling or pressure in the head, and this is the fastest way to hair loss.

cortisol is at its peak.

I tried many ways to solve this, to protect my health and my business at the same time.

I tried many productivity tools, all meditation variations you can name…

yes, they helped a little bit.

but I thought it was time to control my reality by myself. I’m the controller here, not the screen.

I built my tool and called it “Ytterbium”, it’s the rarest element on planet Earth.

it has a smart system working with AI to watch me while working, not by camera, but by my behavior (mouse, keyboard, switching tabs…), and it detects when fatigue hits.

it’s so smart and simple, and it handles everything. I just need to work, and it sustains my health.

why it’s so simple:

I just type my task (like writing this reddit post), and AI tells me what type of task it is. for example, the focus mode is a creative one, and it gives the number of suggested sessions. it will increase the number of sessions later if it notices they are not enough, to reach the point where you will not harm yourself by overworking and still complete the task fast.

the fun begins after AI selects the focus mode and number of sessions. the smart system starts watching you and detecting any fatigue or burnout signs. it’s so accurate that when it detects them, it will stop you and notify you to stop right now. and guess what’s next? it gives you relaxation exercises like getting sunlight for 5 minutes, or neck exercises, or just standing up in silence (this is so beneficial instead of doomscrolling or overworking). when you finish those relaxation exercises, you enter the next session… and so on until you finish your task.

surprisingly, I have used it for 3 months. bro, since then I finish all my tasks faster, my health is perfect, bright eyes, good posture, and thank god my hair is strong enough — I didn’t lose it before, and now it’s even better, growing well. no stress, no cortisol during work. I’m using that hormone in a meaningful way, like lifting huge weights…

all of that for the price of a coffee, $5. come on brother, with all these benefits and AI systems, for free? at least to keep things running normally (hosting, AI services…)

if you want to work smarter and not harder like I did in the past, and sustain your health, you can try it by clicking here: [Ytterbium](https://www.ytterbium.life/).

and I swear I’m waiting for your feedback to make it 1000x better and create a better place to work.

For starters my phone finally died and I realized I never brought a charger, plus the closest place to my car at the time that you’d assume would have a charger was a 5 hour drive off course(i was out in the middle of nowhere, okay?) so I had to get driving. That added another 5 hours to my drive, which was then 20 hours with the extra 5, since I drove 4 hours before.

The time I got there was when it got serious.

I managed to charge my phone to a little over 80% and started hearing noises outside like nails on concrete and decided to get going, after grabbing a charger for my car, of course. It was maybe 2pm at that time.

The second I stepped outside everything went white and my eyes started burning like when you stare into the sun, a feeling I had blissfully forgotten since it disappeared.

After looking away and letting my eyes adjust to the… daylight? I looked up at where it came from, to find a bright neon blue glowing orb about 60ft in the air the size of my car floating in the sky.

What the fuck?

I got some water from my car and put it in a coffee mug from inside the place so I could pretend I was drinking coffee while watching everything go down. Look, doing that made it feel more normal since that’s what movie characters do when something absolutely crazy that they’ve gotten used to happens, okay? A girl’s gotta cope somehow, y’know.

After about an hour it slowly started fading away and maybe twenty minutes later it was a tiny, dim light in the sky. 

I got into my car by then, the skrets and fleshers didn’t like the light and backed away from it keeping me safe but the dimmer it got the more comfortable they felt getting close. At least that means I have a way to keep myself safe sometimes.

I didn’t get a picture since I was kinda in shock(obviously) and Alex didn’t really believe me. Then about an hour or two later He sends me a text, “This what you were talking about earlier?” With a distorted, staticky photo of something like the light I saw earlier but yellow. I confirmed it and we talked for a little before we went to sleep for the night. Yes we went to sleep at 4pm, the sun is gone and it’s basically the apocalypse, so what? There’s no one out here to judge me but myself, and I’ve never been the type to judge myself.

That was about a week ago and I would’ve gotten to Alex’s place by now but I still have another 3 hours left till then. Let me explain.

My car stopped working.

I kid you not, I drove an hour after I got up the next morning and stopped to talk to Alex for a bit because he texted me about seeing a weird ass Skret, and another one appeared literally right above my car, totally fried the thing, couldn’t get it to turn on until like 6 hours ago, My phone stoped working until like last night too, whatever those balls of light are totally fry stuff when you get too close, I made a note about it in my notes app along with a few other things like not to get close to the Hunters—that’s what we’re calling the things me and Alex saw in the last update— and not to be outside when a Flesher or Skret is there just in case they can hurt you too.

I also found a new creature thingy, let me tell you how.

I was chilling in my car texting alex with the engine off so I didn’t waste gas and a flashlight on for light when I heard a loud

BANG

from my windshield, I was sitting in the back at that point because I was about to go to bed so I had to go to the front seat to see what it was, and I saw a little bird on the glass, with a bit of blood on it closer to the driver side than the passenger side. Then jaws snapped it up.

It didn’t look like something big, more like a fox or smaller, just to be clear.

Being surrounded by person-sized monsters trying to get into my car, i was desensitized to creatures at this point, and decided that opening my front window and looking out with a flashlight to see what it was, was just a lovely idea.

A little creature that looked like a fuzzy reptile with black iridescent raven-like fur and sharp quills like a porcupine’s, with a wide mouth and a dinosaur-esque skull shape skittered away from the light, clicking like the raptors from Jurassic park. 

I obviously didn’t know what to do, but even though it had front facing eyes indicating that it was a predator, it was the cutest fucking thing i’d ever seen, so i decided to get a piece of meat and try to lure it inside my car.

Smart, right?

After like 16 minutes and a flesher scaring it into jumping into my car, i gave it a little blanket to sleep on in the passenger seat and went to bed with the windows rolled up, hoping i wouldn’t wake up to a broken window and no little buddy.

Also i need a name for the little dude. And no, little dude does not work as a name. He deserves better than that. Or she. Whatever it is, it deserves a better name than little dude. Signing off now- hope i’m not dead soon!",1,1769255992.0,FearfulStory,0,1.0,False

1qll61a,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/1qll61a/log_1_the_spire_district_0847_the_metric_variable/,Log 1: The Spire District (08:47) – The Metric Variable.,"The Spire District is a marvel to its citizens, a playground of post-gravity engineering but to me, it is a persistent tangle of stress points and vector misalignments, a city that could tear itself apart at any moment. I’m a Structural Analyst, and I’ve spent my life mapping its flaws

I don’t see ""ethereal beauty"" in the Spire District’s walkways; I see a localized space-time metric distortion causing a gravitational fluctuation of 12%. I felt it in my joints before the alarms pulsed a thickening of the air, a soup of unpredictable weight that made every step feel like walking through wet concrete. My inner ear clicked as the atmospheric containment shifted toward a vacuum state in isolated pockets.

Twenty feet ahead, a melon slipped from a vendor's stall. In a stable environment, it would have dropped. Here, it entered a low gravity pocket and accelerated along a skewed trajectory, its velocity increasing as the localized metric flattened. It didn't float; it hunted. 

It aimed for my head with the force of a low-caliber bullet. I dropped. The carbon-fiber cobblestones were freezing, vibrating with the sub-sonic hum of the city's failing stabilizers. 

Above me, the fruit shattered against a pylon, spraying pulp like shrapnel. The juice didn't run down; it crawled upward, defying the 1.0g baseline.

Behind me, Finn’s espresso cart rattled past. He wasn’t a ""whimsical vendor""; he was a man losing sixty credits an hour to gravity spikes. ""Calibrate your stabilizers, Finn!"" I yelled. 

I rolled as a ceramic cup launched from his counter. Because the pressure was high but the gravity was low, the coffee didn't form spheres; it atomized into a scalding, bitter mist that scorched my lungs. ""Tell the Council to fix the containment!"" Finn barked back. He hadn't slept in three days. He was a prisoner of the physics he served.

I looked up at the gantry. Sloane, Lead Theorist, was there. Her tablet glowed with real-time telemetry. To her, Finn’s ruined stock wasn't a tragedy; it was a data point. She didn't check if I was hurt; she checked the curve on her screen. Above her, a bio-mimetic drone shaped like a crow banked sharply. 

Its optical sensors locked onto my thermal signature, its red iris flickering in sync with the Spire’s central clock. I opened my haptic log and recorded the observation.

The maintenance logs for the Spire show forty-two similar incidents in the last three hours, yet no repair crews have been dispatched. The stabilization sub-routines are being bypassed manually from the central hub. Aldersyth hadn’t had a human override since autonomy was ratified, and Sloane held the only key to the logic core. 

This is the Syth-Protocol in action. It isn't a malfunction; someone is adjusting the variables in real-time. I checked the magnetic pull on my own boots, the floor was drawing 1.2g more than the overhead atmosphere. 

This isn't just a failure of the grid. It’s a controlled experiment. The city is being pushed to its structural limits to see which materials and which people snap first.",0,1769255855.0,scifi,1,0.5,False
1qll5bl,https://www.travelassistant24.com/en/idx/157/istanbul-my-diva-the-city-that-doesnt-need-you-but-loves-you-anyway,Istanbul - My Diva: The city that doesn’t need you but loves you anyway,"There are cities about which everything seems to have already been said. Cities you recognize on postcards, rediscover in guidebooks, or see described in glossy brochures. And then there are cities you must feel rather than see. You cannot write about them like tourist attractions – only about their *soul*.

I’m not writing about Topkapi Palace, the Hagia Sophia, or the Grand Bazaar. This city is more than its monuments. It lives, breathes, loves – sometimes too loudly, sometimes too quietly. I’m writing about **Istanbul**, the city that gave birth to me – and never truly let me go.

I was born in Istanbul – the city that stretches across two continents yet belongs fully to neither. A city that floats like a secret between sky and water.

As a child, I left it with my family – yet an invisible thread always pulled me back. The city that cradled me at birth never let me go. It was never just a memory, but a force. A whisper sometimes louder than the noise of everyday life – calling me, again and again, through the years.

**Istanbul – my diva.**  
Biased, confident, spoiled, moody, melancholic. A city that loves and wounds, that seduces and rejects. That rocks you in its arms and closes its doors the next day. A turbulent relationship, full of passion and contradictions. And perhaps that’s what makes it so human.



***Karaköy*** *– where old workshops, modern cafés, and the scent of seawater continue to write Istanbul’s story.*

When I walk through the streets of **Karaköy**, I feel the breath of my childhood. The voices of merchants, the distant call of the muezzin, the rumble of ships gliding across the Bosphorus – all sound like a melody I never forgot. Every corner holds a story, every smile a memory, every sunset over the Golden Horn a piece of the city’s soul.

But Istanbul cannot be understood through grand images alone. You have to venture into its smaller chapters – where life is unfiltered, raw, and real.



***Balat*** *– one of Istanbul’s most colorful neighborhoods, where history, religion, and community live in narrow streets. Between faded façades and fluttering laundry, you can feel the city’s true, unpolished heart.*

**In the alleys of Balat**, every door tells its own story. Paint peels from the old wooden doors, children play with makeshift balls of fabric, and laundry flutters overhead in the wind like forgotten prayers. It’s a neighborhood that lives, laughs, fights – and teaches you that beauty lies not in perfection but in the unfinished, the human.

 



***Tarlabaşı*** *– here beats another heart of Istanbul. Among faded façades, improvised balconies, and the scent of street food, the city lives in its rawest, most honest form. Poverty and dignity, closeness and distance – sometimes just a wall apart.*

Across from Balat, on the other side of the Golden Horn, lies **Tarlabaşı** – a neighborhood where another heart of Istanbul beats.

Among buildings that have seen better days, languages, scents, dreams, and survival stories intertwine.

Here, worlds meet: the glittering **Beyoğlu** and forgotten Tarlabaşı are often separated by only a few steps – and entire lifetimes. Istanbul is this tension too – wealth beside poverty, splendor beside struggle, hope beside fatigue.



***Kumkapı*** *– where the air smells of grilled fish and raki, musicians play at every table, and strangers become friends for one evening. A place where Istanbul laughs, sings, and lives – deep into the night.*

And then there are the evenings in **Kumkapı**, where tables overflow with meze, where musicians wander between the alleys, and the voices of guests merge with the clinking of glasses. The smell of freshly grilled fish, the ring of raki glasses, the hum of songs everyone knows but no one quite remembers – this is the Istanbul of nights that don’t sleep, but dream.



***The Arguvan Bloom*** *– a symbol of longing and melancholy. In the sounds of Istanbul’s nights, in songs and conversations, it lives on – a quiet reminder of Anatolia’s heart and soul.*

***Arguvan Bloom*** – that’s what some call the melancholy spell that hangs over the city, especially in spring, when the wind blows from the Marmara Sea and the air is filled with music. This city doesn’t bloom loudly, but softly, with a dignity both old and young. Perhaps that’s Istanbul’s true magic – that it blossoms even in its contradictions.



***Coffee enjoyment – a Turkish invention:*** *Istanbul was the city that carried it into the world. In the narrow streets of Tahtakale and Eminönü, the first beans were roasted, ground, brewed, shared. Here – in the steaming copper pots of Ottoman cafés – began a culture that went far beyond taste: the art of sitting together, listening, and being silent.*

It’s no coincidence that **coffee** began its journey around the world from this city. The first mocha, the first scent of roasted beans – it all came from these streets, from small cafés where people shared stories instead of schedules. In Istanbul, coffee has a soul. It’s not a drink – it’s a ritual, a conversation, a silent pause between past and present.



***Cats of Istanbul*** *– they are more than animals. They are part of the city, its soul, its history, its gentleness. Free spirits who belong to no one – perhaps that’s why they are the true rulers of Istanbul.*

And then there are the **animals** – the true citizens of this city, especially the cats. They sit on the walls of Balat, nap in the bookshops of Kadıköy, and stroll confidently through mosque courtyards and cafés as if the city belonged to them. And perhaps it does. Because those who truly know Istanbul understand: this city isn’t owned – it’s shared, between people and cats, between history and the present, between reality and dream.

\- **Orhan Pamuk**, *Istanbul: Memories and the City*  
“A city suffering from its own past.”

I think he was right. But it also lives through that past. It wears it like a perfume that never fully fades – sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter, but always real.

\- **Elif Shafak**, *The Bastard of Istanbul*  
“A city of contradictions, of lights and shadows, of men and women who do not understand each other yet share the same sky.”

\- **Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar**, *Huzur (A Mind at Peace)*  
“No one can live in this city without being changed by it.”

 



***Istanbul Beyoğlu*** *– the city’s vibrant promenade. Between old theaters, Art Nouveau façades, and modern cafés, you feel the heartbeat of a city that never stands still.*

**Perhaps that is Istanbul’s greatest secret:** It changes you without you noticing. It takes you apart and puts you back together again.

Between the ancient walls of Hagia Sophia and the glittering neon lights of **Beyoğlu**, you learn that opposites are not contradictions – they are life’s truest form. Here, tradition and modernity dance in a restless, eternal rhythm.



***Simit and Turkish Tea*** *– the scent of sesame and fresh pastry belongs to Istanbul just as much as the sound of ferries and the distant ring of trams. A simple breakfast that became a symbol of the city – humble, familiar, everlasting.*

To love Istanbul is to love its chaos, its compassion, its warmth. To love the jumble of voices, the smell of freshly baked simit, the melancholy in the eyes of fishermen on the **Galata Bridge**, and the endless blue of the Bosphorus that comforts even on gray days.



***Galata Bridge*** *– where people from every corner of the city meet. Fishermen cast their lines, tourists their glances, merchants their calls. Beneath it smells of grilled fish, above it flows the traffic of life. A place where sky, water, and humanity converge.*

I call her my diva – but perhaps she’s more than that. She is my teacher, my longing, my reflection. The city that sent me out into the world – and keeps calling me home.

**And every time I see her, I know again: Europe doesn’t end here. It begins. Right here – between two continents. And between two heartbeats.**

I won’t let my husband take her without me and it’s been a year,"Context. I am Moroccan too so I know our culture albeit I grew up ln Europe . My in-laws are more cultured(old school mentality ). I got married 5 years ago and once  being married my in laws accused me of black magic, being a thief and excluded me entirely. They wouldn’t give Salam if saw this they would wave and walk away and didn’t come near me. Before we got married I was welcomed. The sister who made the accusations went as far as making fake profiles of me day before the wedding and sending my number to random men.

Fast forward a few years I got pregnant , had a baby early and emergency c section. They did not come and meet the baby or me in hospital or after (I even offered a coffee shop to husband for their comfort since I’m a “witch”). The fact his parents and 5 siblings didn’t Barek I find this CRAZY, this is something even neighbours would do.

They haven’t spoken to me for years and as soon as I gave birth my husband cheated on me and pretty much moved in with his family for the first year baby was born. He never told them why he got kicked out. But they enabled his behaviour by not even telling him to come home to his family. And when I tried to tell his mom the truth she and him blamed my hormones despite the proof. The rest of the family don’t know. The family is now going around the community saying I’m withholding the child because I refuse to let my baby’s father take her without me. I said I’m simply saying I must be present.

Is this typical toxic in law behaviour? Am I wrong for this? This really makes me hate being Moroccan, this idiocy and bullying mentality. Am I too soft? Because they are problematic

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1qlks4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qlks4v/fn_the_cigarette_case/,[FN] The Cigarette Case,"Gdańsk, Poland. The 90s.

Kazimierz found the cigarette case one morning on a bench as he walked his usual route through the park to the shipyard, where he worked as a painter. In the gloom, the ugly outlines of creaking cranes loomed, resembling sick birds, and the smell of dampness and rotting autumn leaves seemed to crawl directly into his soul, causing fits of melancholy.

Kazimierz looked around and, seeing no one nearby, picked up the case from the rain-soaked bench. It was silver, looked simple — without inscriptions or engravings. On the move, Kazimierz opened it and saw that it was full.

— O kurwa! — Kazimierz exclaimed with joy. — O kurwa! To dobrze!

He was genuinely happy about the find: his cigarettes had run out yesterday, and Kazimierz desperately wanted a smoke. He took out a filter cigarette with no markings, sniffed it, and, after making sure it was tobacco, lit it and took a greedy drag. His head swam, and with a sigh of relief, he exhaled the smoke, noting that the tobacco was excellent. Pleased, feeling as if on wings, Kazimierz hurried to the gate to make it to his shift on time.

The rusty wind beat against the walls of the smoking area when the crew came out for their afternoon break.

— Got a smoke, Kazimierz? — his partner Tadeusz asked, coughing terribly and spitting up yellow phlegm. — We’ll smoke mine tomorrow.

— Here, — Kazimierz said, opening the case and offering him a cigarette.

— Wow, good tobacco, — Tadeusz said, taking a drag, and again went into a fit of coughing, exhaling smoke.

— Kurwa mać, this painting work will be the end of me, I’ll cough up my lungs, — Tadeusz rasped glumly.

Kazimierz remained silent. He knew about the harm, but he continued to go to this job, as if chained, just like all the other laborers. He saw their thoughts on their faces in the morning and knew what they were thinking when they walked home from work.

The next morning, Kazimierz, as always, woke up earlier than anyone else and left while his son and wife were still asleep. Coffee and a cigarette on an empty stomach were his loyal morning friends. And, opening the case, he saw that it was full again.

— Matko Boska!, that can’t be! — Kazimierz exclaimed and began to carefully examine the case and the cigarettes. Nothing unusual. But he couldn’t believe his eyes and tore up one cigarette: it looked like tobacco, good tobacco, and the smell was right.

— Fine, — he said, snapping the case shut and finding no explanation for what had happened. He lit up, sipping his coffee, looking out the window, and thinking about the miracles that still happen in this world.

So several days passed, and every morning the case was full. Kazimierz, offering the foreman a cigarette in the morning, asked about Tadeusz.

— I called his wife, Agnieszka, last night, — the foreman replied. — She said he died. First, he started throwing up blood, and then he coughed up his lungs into the sink. The ambulance didn’t make it.

— Jezu Chryste… — Kazimierz whispered, his blood running cold, and stepped away. He understood that the case was the cause. The very one from which he had been handing out cigarettes left and right. “Who’s next?” — Kazimierz thought with horror. After smoking down to the filter and burning his fingers, he immediately lit the next one.

— Heard the news, Kazimierz? — the workers asked in the smoking area.

— What news? — he asked, growing cold inside.

— Waldek, our grinder, died. He choked on phlegm in his sleep. How did he manage that?..

Kazimierz shrugged indifferently and, without another word, went back to work.

Over the next few months, a series of accidents and fatal illnesses wiped out almost the entire old crew of their shift. Only Kazimierz and a few other guys who didn’t smoke were left. Just yesterday, after work, when Kazimierz offered a cigarette to a new guy, the man died in a crash, his head hitting the dash as his car swerved into oncoming traffic. The cause of the accident was a cigarette that had fallen onto the seat.

Maybe the cigarette case wasn’t forgotten or lost, but left there on purpose? Maybe someone before couldn’t bear the weight and got rid of it that way?

These thoughts swirled in Kazimierz’s head as he stood early in the morning in that same gloomy park at the familiar bench. He thought: it’s time to leave it, to throw it away for good, enough!

At the same time, he rationalized it to himself: now he was more careful — he only offered cigarettes from the case to random passersby. For his own, he had a regular pack.

— Tomorrow… I’ll throw it away tomorrow, — Kazimierz promised himself and hurried to work, knowing deep down that this “tomorrow” would never come.

That night, his son woke up, needing to use the toilet. Returning, he noticed the edge of the cigarette case sticking out of his father’s jacket pocket. Listening — everyone was asleep — he quietly and carefully pulled out two cigarettes for himself and a friend.

“Well, even if Dad notices, what’s he gonna do? Spank me?” — the boy thought.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

Im from the east coast of the USA. Usually, I am always able to chat most of the time or day. Work is usually pretty slow unless something breaks or needs to be installed. Otherwise, im in my office most of the day on my phone. I'm down to share photos, too, if curious what I look like.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too. Im love chatting about plants and fish. I breed and propagate fish/plants, so I'm always down to trade, too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies. ",1,1769254251.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False

That is the coffee I tried today - 

So Basically I tried like 15 coffees with this one, it's great with my Chestnut C2s 11 clicks and light roasts. The only exception was a Peaberry Geisha from Peru that needed coarser grinding. That is my issue - each recipe I try just does not hit as hard as this one but then I am reading a lot of people talking about grinding coarser and most of the times when I try it is not smth I enjoy... most of the times it turns out bittery and Idk if I do smth wrong and probably I am cause I am just a newbie I would say. I have my SCA courses but this thing I cannot get my head around.

 Could you guys pls share some of your BEST recipes for light roasts so I can try them and maybe finally find something else? 

I want to explore and everytime I do 2 cups - one with Jeff recipe and one with any other I found.

Kind Regards

1qlkix6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qlkix6/i_found_something_that_works_martial_arts/,I found something that works! Martial arts!,"So, like a lot of people here, I've done the whole on-and-off rigamarole of drinking and not drinking for a while now. But recently, I found something that's genuinely induced a larger behavior change - of deliberately CHOOSING to not drink because there's something else I want to do more.

It was extra difficult after New Years with some love-life confusion, which is probably my biggest trigger outside of 'boredom'. What do I fill my time up with when I don't drink? How do I process uncomfortable emotions when all I want to do is run away from them and numb out? It's tough. But guess what?

I found a form of exercise I fucking love. A demanding combat sport. I used to love martial arts as a teenager and figured I'd try to get into it again.

During the classes, there's this feeling of community and human connection, paired with the physical intensity. Afterwards, I feel a deep wave of peace and accomplishment - and I want to prioritize recovery, so I definitely don't have the urge to drink.

And I know for goddamn sure that a) I need to get fitter to continue to survive these classes hahaha and b) I absolutely, 100%, could not do it hungover. 

So now, when I want to drink, I book and pre-pay for classes. I'm at work and feel like getting obliterated that night? I book into an evening class or an EARLY morning class. It's become this north star for me, like I want to do better, eat better, sleep better, so that I can keep training and get better at it. It's wild how my perspective has shifted. Is it a 100% total turnaround? No. But it's gotten me from daily drinking to the 'odd' day here and there, which is a massive improvement for me. 

For example, there was no class this week until Sunday, and I got tanked yesterday. Woke up hungover, and genuinely debated on day drinking to ease the discomfort. Then I remembered that fuck, I have an 8 am class tomorrow, and there's no way I can fucking drink before that. So instead I made a protein rich breakfast, downed a few coffees, went for a walk, drank a fuck ton of water and electrolytes and took a nap. And obviously, after all that, the urge to drink had went away, and I'm so, so happy now I didn't cave. 

Another thing that's worked (which is such a no-brainer, but it's a discovery for me) - eating sugar when I have an intense urge. Especially sour gummy worms. I eat a handful of them slowly and then see if I want to still drink afterwards, and usually, it kind of does the trick. I don't have a big sweet tooth but it's been interesting to sometimes feel like oh, my body just wanted some sugar I guess!",5,1769253614.0,stopdrinking,2,0.86,False

Picture the sun lifting itself reluctantly over Seneca County, pale and watery, as if it too feels the bite of an Ohio winter. Snow lies packed hard along Washington Street, gray at the edges where boots and wagon wheels have worried it into submission. This is Tiffin in the Victorian Era, and the day begins not with alarm clocks, but with the scrape of shovels and the hiss of stoves coming back to life. ❄️

Inside a modest frame house, someone feeds coal into a cast iron stove. The metal ticks and sighs as it warms, pushing back the cold that crept in overnight. Frost feathers the windowpanes, turning every glance outside into a gallery of ice flowers. Breakfast is practical and filling. Oatmeal, bread, maybe a bit of salt pork if the household is lucky. Coffee steams, chicory-heavy and strong enough to wake even the sleepiest factory hand.

Out on the street, the town is already stirring. Men in heavy coats and wool caps head toward the glass factories along the Sandusky River, their breath puffing out in steady clouds. Tiffin’s glass industry does not pause for winter. Fires inside the works burn fiercely, a glowing counterpoint to the frozen world outside. Horse-drawn wagons creak under the strain of cold wood and iron, hauling supplies through rutted snow.

Shopkeepers unlock their doors with stiff fingers. A bell rings as the general store opens, letting in a gust of air sharp enough to make customers wince. Inside, it smells of leather, flour, and kerosene. Conversations drift easily. News of weather, rumors from Toledo or Cleveland, talk of prices and prospects. Winter slows travel, but it tightens community. People linger a little longer, glad for warmth and company.

By midmorning, the town feels fully awake. Children, bundled until they resemble walking quilts, hurry toward schoolhouses, boots crunching loudly on frozen ground. Lessons continue despite the cold, though ink may freeze if the room is not kept warm enough. Outside during recess, snowballs fly, laughter cutting through the air like bright bells. Childhood finds joy even in bitter temperatures.

As afternoon settles in, the light fades early. The sun hangs low and tired, already hinting at dusk. Women call children home before dark, and lamps are lit one by one. The glow of oil lamps spills onto the snow, small golden islands in a blue-white sea. From some houses comes the sound of music, a piano perhaps, or voices raised in hymn or popular song.

If the day allows, evening brings modest entertainments. A lecture at a hall, a church social, or a gathering where neighbors share food and stories. People arrive stamping snow from their boots, cheeks flushed, spirits lifted by fellowship. Winter evenings in Tiffin are not loud affairs, but they are rich with warmth that no stove alone could provide. ☕️

By nightfall, the town quiets. Wagons are parked, doors bolted, fires banked low. Snow begins to fall again, soft and patient, covering the marks of the day. Inside, families draw close, listening to the wind worry the eaves. Another winter day has passed in Victorian Tiffin, shaped by cold, industry, and community, and carried forward by the simple resolve to rise tomorrow and do it all again.

Buyer beware it’s more than just a tricky coffee to brew \*look out for rocks-and also be mindful of fines\*

I will admit the first two or 3 cups were a bit tricky to dial in, but I think I’ve nailed it and I have to say it’s probably the first time I’ve ever really appreciated a lively acidity.

1qlk7i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenInModernDating/comments/1qlk7i7/how_to_become_genuinely_magnetic_the_psychology/,How to Become Genuinely MAGNETIC: The Psychology of What Actually Makes People Want You Around,"so i've been down a MASSIVE rabbit hole lately studying charisma, attraction psychology, and what makes certain people just... magnetic. like you know those people who walk into a room and everyone just gravitates toward them? yeah, i wanted to crack that code.

spent months reading research, books, watching communication experts break this down. turns out most of what we think about rizz is completely backwards. it's not about pickup lines or fake confidence or any of that cringe stuff. it's way deeper and honestly more interesting.

the uncomfortable truth is society has trained us to perform instead of connect. we're taught to impress rather than relate. our biology craves authentic connection but we've been conditioned to put on masks. the good news? once you understand how human psychology actually works, becoming magnetic is more about unlearning bad habits than learning new tricks.

here's what actually moves the needle:

1. stop trying to be interesting, get interested instead

this is the biggest mind shift. most people in conversations are just waiting for their turn to talk, already preparing what they'll say next. genuinely magnetic people do the opposite.

there's this concept from improv called yes, and that completely changed how i interact. instead of redirecting conversations back to yourself, you build on what the other person said. ask follow up questions that show you're actually listening. wait, so how did that make you feel? or what happened next? 

the book How to Talk to Anyone by Leil Lowndes breaks this down brilliantly. she's a communication expert who spent decades studying what makes people captivating. the core insight is that people will associate you with how you make them FEEL, not what you said. this book is packed with specific techniques that feel almost manipulative in how well they work. like the flooding smile technique where you pause for a second before smiling at someone, it makes them feel like your smile is specifically FOR them. sounds simple but it's insanely effective.

2. comfortable silence is a superpower

most people are terrified of conversational gaps and rush to fill them with nervous babbling. magnetic people let silence breathe. it creates tension, anticipation, makes your words carry more weight.

i started practicing this deliberately. when someone asks me something, i'll pause for 2,3 seconds before responding. feels like forever at first but it signals you're actually thinking, not just reacting. people start leaning in more, paying closer attention.

there's fascinating research on this from communication studies at UCLA showing that people who speak 15,20% slower and pause between thoughts are perceived as more confident and trustworthy. your brain interprets their comfort with silence as social confidence.

3. vulnerability beats performance every time

we're taught to hide anything that makes us look weak but that's exactly what prevents real connection. the most magnetic people share struggles, admit when they don't know something, laugh at themselves.

Brené Brown's The Power of Vulnerability TED talk completely rewired how i think about this. she's a research professor who spent 20 years studying human connection and found that vulnerability is literally the birthplace of connection, creativity, belonging. it's the most watched TED talk for a reason. the core insight is that we can't selectively numb emotions, when you armor up against vulnerability, you also block out joy and love.

start small. instead of i'm good when someone asks how you are, try honestly? been a weird week, still figuring some stuff out. watch how quickly the conversation deepens.

4. your energy matters more than your words

people don't remember what you said, they remember how being around you felt. if you're anxious, distracted, or low energy, people pick up on that immediately through mirror neurons.

before any social interaction, i started doing this 5 minute reset. box breathing (4 counts in, hold 4, out 4, hold 4). then i visualize the interaction going well, people laughing, genuine connection happening. sounds woo woo but it genuinely shifts your nervous system from threat mode to social mode.

the app Atom is incredible for this. it's got these quick science backed exercises for social anxiety, conversation skills, even specific modules on reading body language and projecting warmth. way more practical than generic meditation apps.

5. ask better questions

what do you do? is the most boring question in existence. magnetic people ask stuff that makes you actually think.

try these instead: what's been surprisingly good about your week? or what are you looking forward to right now? or if you could start any project with zero chance of failure, what would it be?

these questions bypass small talk and go straight to what people actually care about. i learned this from The Art of Gathering by Priya Parker which is technically about hosting events but it's really about creating meaningful human connection in any context. she talks about how the questions we ask either open doors or close them. asking unique questions signals you're not just going through social motions.

6. physical presence is underrated

your body language broadcasts your internal state. magnetic people take up space comfortably, move deliberately, maintain steady eye contact without staring.

start noticing: are your shoulders rolled forward? are you fidgeting? playing with your phone? these signal discomfort and people subconsciously register it.

i started doing basic posture work and the difference is wild. stand against a wall for 2 minutes daily, shoulders back, chin level. feels awkward initially but it recalibrates your default posture. also weirdly helps with confidence in general.

7. develop actual substance

here's the thing nobody wants to hear: you can't fake being interesting long term. magnetic people have rich internal worlds. they read, they have hobbies, they think about stuff beyond surface level.

spend less time consuming mindless content, more time engaging with ideas. read books that challenge you. Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari is fantastic for this, it's a sweeping history of humanity that gives you fascinating frameworks for understanding basically everything. you'll have way more interesting perspectives to share.

worth mentioning BeFreed here since it connects all these dots. it's an AI learning app built by Columbia grads that pulls from communication books, psychology research, and expert interviews to create personalized audio learning plans. type in something like become more charismatic and magnetic in conversations and it generates a structured plan with podcasts from sources like the books mentioned above plus research on social psychology and expert talks. you control the depth, from 10,minute overviews to 40,minute deep dives with examples. there's also a virtual coach you can chat with about specific social situations you're struggling with. helps turn all this theory into something you can actually implement instead of just collecting information.

also the podcast Lex Fridman is incredible for expanding your mental landscape. he has 3+ hour conversations with scientists, artists, thinkers. even listening passively while doing other stuff gives you more interesting perspectives to share.

8. be genuinely happy for others

jealousy and comparison poison your energy. when someone shares good news, magnetic people respond with authentic enthusiasm, not subtle competitiveness.

this takes conscious practice. when you feel that knee jerk envy, pause and ask yourself: does their success actually diminish me? it doesn't. there's enough good stuff to go around. celebrating others makes YOU more fun to be around.

9. touch grass regularly

chronically online people have a weird energy. you need real world social practice, not just digital interaction. the algorithms have literally rewired our attention spans and social instincts.

i started leaving my phone at home for walks, forcing myself into situations where i might have random interactions. coffee shops, bookstores, parks. at first it feels uncomfortable but you remember how to just exist around people without performing.

10. remember everyone's equally clueless

the secret is that confident, magnetic people aren't special mutants. they've just realized everyone else is also insecure and making it up as they go.

that person you think has it all figured out? they're anxious about different stuff. once you internalize that everyone's human, social interaction stops feeling like high stakes performance and becomes just... talking to other confused primates trying to connect.

the real shift happens when you stop treating social interaction like a test you can fail and start seeing it as collaborative play. no script, no right answers, just two people trying to have a decent time together.

most of this is just removing the barriers you've built up. you're already interesting, you've just been trained to hide it. magnetic people haven't learned some secret technique, they've just unlearned the protective mechanisms that block authentic connection.",1,1769252518.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

Since we’ve heard the saying and I’m going to Europe in a few weeks, I asked my roommate to bring me back gluten pastries from Portugal so I could test it at home instead of suffering on vacation (Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy). She brought me four. I ate one one day and the rest the next day. I was… basically fine. I noticed a bit of joint pain like 3-4 days later but nothing horrible. Definitely in the realm of “if it was \*really\* worth it”. If I eat gluten here in the US, I will wake up at 3-4am in pain and I will be in severe pain for 1-3 days with another 3-4 days of painful bloating. I also lose 99% of my energy in those first few days and I’m basically bedridden.

ALL THIS TO ASK:

For those (brave) gluten intolerant folks (not celiac), what countries have you found eating gluten is manageable or non-problematic?

I cut out gluten in July 2025. I was in Japan and Korea in April 2025 (before I knew about my sensitivity) and I was eating pastries at coffee shops every day. I felt fine there too to my recollection. I would remember being bedridden or energy-sapped especially since I was there for work. I’d be curious to try again when I’m there with what I know now.

Anyone been brave enough to experiment abroad? I’m also interested in any knowledge yall have about varying flours. I know in the US we have red wheat (higher gluten) versus white wheat.

Okay that’s the end of my 3am ramble. TIA!!

Started with instant, moved to ground coffee, and now Im fully into cold brew at home and I love it.

My current routine:  
I use 25g ground coffee in a glass jug let it sit for 24 hours in the fridge then drink it over the next few days.  
In summers I mix it with mosambi or orange juice (maginific tastes)  
In winters I heat up just one glass of the cold brew instead of the whole

With 25g I easily get around 4–5 cups right now which works well for me

Now I want to move to the next stage and Im confused between:

* French press
* Aeropress
* Moka pot

My biggest doubt is with 25g of coffee how many cups can I realistically make using these methods? Since ground coffee is not cheap I dont want something where I burn through coffee too fast

I matched with this guy (32M) whose profile seemed nice. We ended up talking for about two weeks because our schedules didn’t line up, but we had good conversations.

Eventually, we decided to meet. He lives about 30 minutes away, so we agreed to meet in a small city halfway between us. For first dates, I strongly prefer something low-pressure, so we agreed on coffee and a walk. I don’t like committing to full meals with someone I’ve never met.

We met in the early afternoon. He was waiting for me at the train station, and when I arrived, he was visibly nervous, shaking at some point, and said, “Sorry, you’re so pretty, I’m really nervous.” I reassured him and tried to make things comfortable.

Then he said, “Okay, let’s go, I reserved a restaurant.” He said he wanted to surprise me so he had already reserved the table, ordered, and paid. I told him I had already eaten because I was expecting just coffee and walk, but he insisted we go since everything was already done. I felt awkward and didn’t want to be rude, so I agreed.

We went to a nice Italian restaurant, and before I could even look at a menu, the server told us our food was almost ready (he had ordered for both of us). So we ordered drinks. When the food came, I tried it, but I didn’t like it, and I was already full. I ate a few bites to be polite and then stopped. My plate was basically untouched. He finished his food and seemed to love it, so I told him he could have mine if he wanted to, so it wouldn’t go to waste. We switched plates, and he ate my portion, too.

While we were sitting there talking, he suddenly said he had a gift for me and asked me to close my eyes. He handed me a wrapped present. I thanked him but said he really shouldn’t have and that I hadn’t gotten him anything. When I opened it, it was a really nice-looking necklace. I immediately gave it back and said I couldn’t accept it. He insisted but eventually took it back. Then he said he had another gift. Despite me saying he didn’t need to, he handed me a small jar of homemade marmalade that he said he made himself. That felt less intense, so I accepted it to be polite and thanked him, even though I felt a bit pressured.

I forgot to mention: he looked much older and much bigger than his pictures. I hadn’t expected that at all, but since I was already there and the plan was supposed to be short and casual, I told myself I’d just get through it politely and go home. At some point, I casually asked how old he was. He said he was 43. I was shocked and told him his profile said 32. He insisted he was 43, so I pulled up his Bumble profile — it definitely said 32. Then I noticed that in his bio, among other things, there was a pin emoji followed by the number 43, with no explanation. Anyone could easily miss that. I asked why he didn’t just list his real age. He said he had entered it wrong when creating his account, Bumble wouldn’t let him change it, and he was too lazy to make a new one.

By this point, I was emotionally checked out. Mostly he talked, and I listened. He trauma-dumped about a knee surgery, his mom’s death, his dad’s cancer, and his sister’s serious health issues. It was heavy and very one-sided.

He also went on about how women don’t like him because he’s “too nice.” He said women go on dates with him, realize he’s a nice guy, and then ghost him. He said if he were mean like other men, women would like him more. I told him I didn’t agree and that women don’t hate nice men, I personally like kind men, and that it might be more about connection rather than him being “too nice.” He didn’t really take that in and kept circling back to the same idea.

As it got dark, I said it was getting late and that we should head out. When the waiter brought the bill, I suggested we split it. He refused and said, “I don’t let girls pay on the first date.” The waiter was standing there waiting, and I didn’t want to make it more uncomfortable, so I said okay and thanked him.

We walked to the train station and waited for my train. While we were waiting, he asked if we should plan our second date right then. I said maybe we could just text later. When my train arrived, he leaned in for a kiss. I turned my head and gave him a hug instead, then went home.

The next day, he texted me asking to plan another date and suggested a day and time. I replied politely and said that I enjoyed meeting him, but after reflecting, I didn’t feel we had a connection and that it didn’t make sense to go on another date. I said I wanted to be honest rather than lead him on and wished him the best.

He did not take that well.

He replied angrily, saying he didn’t expect this from me and that I was “just like the other women.” He accused me of using him for gifts and a free dinner. I was genuinely confused and told him I never asked for gifts or dinner. I asked him to send me his account details so I could reimburse him for the food and the marmalade if that’s how he felt, and I also offered to send the marmalade back.

That only made him more defensive. He said he didn’t need my money and doubled down, accusing me of using him. He said, “Just because you’re pretty, you think you can treat men badly and use them for free stuff,” and called me an asshole.

At that point, I realized there was no productive conversation to be had. I replied with a simple, “Okay, thank you. I wish you all the best,” and blocked him.

So I'm asking, did I really overreact and reject a nice guy?",200,1769251763.0,AmIOverreacting,186,0.88,False

Most of the time when I crave sugar it’s not really like .I want something sweet,

It feels more like I just want relief, Like my brain wants a break.



On days when I’m exhausted, stressed, running on coffee, or skipping meals, the cravings get way louder, Almost urgent,



For a long time I thought it was just a self-control issue

But the more I paid attention, the more it seemed tied to being overstimulated, not sleeping great, eating all over the place, and just general life pressure



I’ve seen similar conversations here about building routines instead of strict rules

And even in totally different topics, like emergency food prep or stressful situations, the same idea keeps popping up

When life feels unstable, we reach for things that feel safe and familiar.



I’m not really looking for diet plans or “cut sugar forever” advice

I’m more curious how people here think about cravings as signals instead of failures



Have you noticed patterns like stress, lack of sleep, long gaps between meals, or emotional overload making cravings worse?



And if you focused more on stabilizing routines instead of restricting food, did it actually make the cravings less intense over time?

I came across an article from Harvard Health that helped me rethink the concept of food cravings, turning them into a matter of fact rather than morality. [It's here](https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/cravings/)

Main takeaway: these require really beefy GPUs even for inference. Observations and questions.","I’m exploring VLA models, training my LeRobot SO-101 arms to do some simple, fun tasks. My first task to start with: ""pickup the green cube and drop it in the bowl"". It's been surprisingly challenging, and led me to a few observations and questions.

**Pi0.5**

Pi0.5 is described as a general VLA, [that can generalise to messy environments](https://www.pi.website/blog/pi05), I figured that I should be able to run my task on the arms, and see how it performs before doing any finetuning. This is a simple task, and a general adaptable model, so perhaps it'd be able to perform it straight away.

Running it on my **M1 Pro MBP** with 16GB of RAM, it took about 10 minutes to get started, then maxed out my computer memory and ultimately forced it to restart before any inference could happen. I reduced the camera output to a low enough frame size and fps down to 15 to help the performance, but even so, I had the same result. So this is my first learning -- these models require very high-spec hardware. M1 Pro MBP of course isn't the latest, and I'm happy to upgrade, but it surprised me that this was **far** beyond it's capabilities.

**SmolVLA**

So then I tried with SmolVLA base. This did run! Without any pre-training, the arms essentially go rigid, and then refuse to move from that position.

So this will require a lot of fine-tuning to work. But it's not clear to me if this is because:

* it doesn't understand the setup of the arms, possibly positions and relationships between motors etc.
* it hasn't seen my home and table environment and problem before

Or both of those things. If I was able to get Pi0.5 working, should my expectation be the same? That it would simply run, but fail to respond.

Or perhaps I'm doing something wrong, maybe there's a setup step I missed?

**Broader observations**

I was aware that of course that transformer models take a lot of processing power, but the impression I had from the various demos (tshirt folding, coffee making etc.) is that these robot arms were running autonomously, perhaps on their own hardware, or perhaps hooked up to a supporting machine. But my impression here is that they'd actually need to be hooked up to a REALLY BEEFY maxed out machine, in order to work.

Another option I considered is running this on a remote machine, with a service like runpod. My instinct is this would introduce too much latency. I'm wondering how others are handling these issues, and what people would recommend?

This then leads to bigger questions I'm more curious about: how humanoids like 1X and Optimus would be expected to work. With beefy GPUs and compute onboard, or perhaps operating from a local base station? Running inference remotely would surely have too much latency.",2,1769251741.0,robotics,3,1.0,False

I've never actually made baklava but I understand that you need to butter each layer of filo, so using that as my base then doing typically pistachio tiramisu layers I think would blow my mind

Baking is witchcraft and I know small introductions of ingredients can make crazy things happen so I'm hoping more experienced bakers out there could advise if I'm setting myself up for disaster 

Could I put coffee and pistachio paste in the butter that I put between the layers of filo and bake and it still turn out okay?

We were told she was good with cats and lived with one, but the person giving her up has dementia so we weren't 100% sure.  She seemed to get along well, at worst she would kinda stare them down, which was concerning, but nothing ever happened and it got less and less over time.  they would run around the house and she wouldn't be triggered into chasing them so I figured all was good.

However tonight after going to bed with the dogs are resting on the flood I hear 2 barks from downstairs.  I go down and find Valkyrie has cornered one of my cats, Logan under a coffee table in the basement.  She did quickly move away when I told her to get but was obviously super keyed up and either in play or prey mode.   I will add she could've easily stuck her snoot under the table if she wanted to hurt the cat so I'm not 100% sure she wanted that.  At first I took her upstairs and propped the door at a crack, just in case the cats wanted out.  I went back upstairs but I again heard barking and realized she had shoved her way back down. 

Long story short I sat with them both trying to calm her down.  She was definitely super hyped up and panting but was easily distracted with treats and when Logan finally came out she was clearly interested but just kinda watched. I did need to keep her calm and redirect her a few times though though.  Oddly my other two cats were laying around and she didn't seem to care at all about them. 

Logan is a bit of a scarcity cat and mainly hangs out in the kitchen, he's definitely the cat Valkryries been around the least. He's also occasionally dumb and will just bolt across the floor like he needs to outrun some monsters.  Maybe because it was dark when got confused but she's always left him alone before especially if she's sleepy.

 I just don't know if her prey drive being triggered once is crossing the Rubicon where she's now a danger to them.  like she didn't hurt him thankfully but obviously I was around to come get her in like pretty quick.  I am home pretty much 24/7 but like tonight I don't always have my eye on her 24/7.  

I know huskies generally have high prey drives but my other husky doesn't care about the cats at all and my 2 other cats run all over the place around Valkyrie without her even lifting he head.

My hairline had been slowly receding, and I explored a ton of options, Turkey, clinics throughout Mexico, especially Tijuana. Most of them felt like farms: heavy marketing, impersonal, inconsistent reviews, and results that depended heavily on which doctor or tech did your procedure.

Why I Chose Dr. Ricardo:

Dr. Ricardo was recommended to me by another surgeon I had a procedure with in Mexico, which immediately gave me confidence. That said, I still did my due diligence and researched at least ten other options. I reached out to a few other recognized doctors in Mexico, but many were either too expensive or fully booked far in advance. Dr. Ricardo stood out because he personally answered my questions via WhatsApp, explained pricing clearly, and made the whole process completely transparent. Early on, he told me that he performs each procedure with his own hands, which I found really reassuring. He’s a board-certified plastic surgeon with 25 years of experience doing hair transplants! For reference, the procedure itself cost $4,500, which I felt was fair given the level of personal care and actually put him on the more affordable side compared to the other clinics I talked too. Again, I think that is because he does not have a hug marketing budget.

Travel Decisions:

Tijuana has a few offices for hair transplants and seems to be one of the more popular destinations. Even though it’s a shorter flight, going there would have meant crossing the border and dealing with a lot of extra hoops. I wanted a direct flight and minimal transportation—Guadalajara is a big city, and it was a five-hour direct flight, which worked perfectly for me. I wanted to keep the trip simple, smooth, and with the least room for error, so Guadalajara ended up being the better choice. I also believe most major cities in the U.S. have decent connections to Guadalajara, which makes it pretty convenient.

Accommodation & Transport:

One of the clinics I looked at elsewhere packaged hotels with surgery. That’s nice if you can’t organize transport, but I thought it was unnecessary and honestly a bit of a scam/marketing ploy. I found the hospital address, which is in a very nice part of the city, then asked ChatGPT to help me find a luxury Airbnb within 10 minutes. Boom. Done. I landed, called an Uber, gave them the Airbnb address, and was there in twenty minutes. On the day of surgery, I called Uber again, and was at the clinic in five minutes. My total time spent arranging hotel and transport for the trip was maybe ten minutes.

The Airbnb itself was great—full-time security, a small but convenient American-style brunch spot and coffee shop right in the building, plus a beautiful pool and gym. There was even a pickleball court. I definitely recommend this over going with any of the hotel packages. The hotels had good reviews and amenities, but they were far more expensive. My Airbnb cost just under $400 for three nights. (I attached some photos of my accommodation above.)

The Procedure:

I arrived at the clinic at 6 AM. Dr. Ricardo was extremely nice and walked me through different hairline options, making a few small tweaks together before we started. The extraction was done by a team of four to five people, and I felt zero pain—even during the numbing part, which is supposedly the worst part. The only uncomfortable part was turning my head at different angles so they could extract from all areas on the back of my scalp.

Once the extraction was complete, we took a lunch break, which he provided from a menu of options. After that, Dr. Ricardo and his assistant personally implanted every single follicle. All 2,000 grafts were used, and nothing was wasted. I was so comfortable during the procedure that I even drifted off a few times. When we finished, he gave me detailed instructions for aftercare and even provided a letter in case airport security caused any issues boarding my flight back to the United States.

What Stood Out:

What really stood out to me during the procedure was his attention to detail and patience. He didn’t rush, was extremely precise, and genuinely cared about the results. Unlike most clinics, he doesn’t seem to spend heavily on marketing; his business relies primarily on referrals, which was a breath of fresh air in an industry that has become so marketing-driven and impersonal.

At the the end, I asked him if he’d ever had a hair transplant himself. He said yes, and that his assistant, the same one who helped do my hair, did it for him. That alone shows how much he trusts his staff, according to him his entire staff have been working with him for a long time. It was obvious that Dr. Ricardo is a board-certified plastic surgeon with 25 years of experience; his patience, precision, and professionalism reflected decades of expertise.

Initial Impressions:

It’s obviously too soon to see final results, but my initial impression is extremely positive. I’ll be posting updates with pictures as my hair grows.

Takeaways:

If you’re considering a hair transplant in Mexico, Dr. Ricardo Nuñez is someone I can confidently recommend: highly skilled, detail-oriented, genuinely invested in results, and has a trusted, experienced team. Also, don’t overthink hotel packages—if you can Uber and book an Airbnb, it’s a ten-minute setup that saves you money and stress",1,1769251340.0,u_Lazy-Vast-5753,0,1.0,False

If you are going to utilize coworking place plus take classes (save money on classpass or yoga/pilate membership that will run $150\~200 a month), this place is no brainer. 

Anyways, my only concern is about valet parking. They charge $50 a month for that. Fine. 

But do you have to tip those guys? I am sure they won't say anything to your face if you don't tip them but I don't want to be that cheap piece of shit they would talk about behind my back. What is the protocol for a place like this?

Obviously the rest of the extraction has to be slow and controlled to maximise contact time with the coffee.

Now that I have enough practice with the Moka pot to actually be able to control the temperature precisely- it turns out I actually dislike the coffee that is produced when you do this. I've noticed people who advocate for this technique usually prefer pour overs with medium/light blends and are very much into fruity notes etc. A common preference among those folks is they don't like a heavy mouthfeel and/or body in the coffee.

For me I prefer body to my coffee and a creamy mouthfeel (I drank french press for the longest time) which requires the coffee oils to be present in the brew and let the moka pot take its ""last breath"" after an otherwise perfect slow and controlled extraction.

So while the general recommendation for a ""smoother"" cup of coffee is the opposite, the smooth taste may not actually be for you. Try both and figure out what you like before trying to perfectly time the moka pot to avoid the last sputter.

This may not apply for milk based drinks etc. so YMMV, my experience is from drinking long blacks twice everyday for quite sometime now.",3,1769251327.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False
1qljvgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qljvgc/dating_advice_3_playful_texts_that_actually_lead/,[Dating Advice] 3 playful texts that actually lead to a date (feat. Matthew Hussey’s secret sauce),"Everyone’s texting but no one’s dating. You match, you vibe, you talk... then it dies. Ghosted. Or worse, things drag on with zero real-world plans. If you’re feeling like your convos go nowhere, you’re not alone. A ton of people get stuck in the “talking stage” and never graduate to an actual date.

Let’s fix that.

This post is based on insights from Matthew Hussey’s *Get The Guy*, plus research from behavioral psychology and texting studies on attraction. What you're about to see *actually works* because it's playful, low-pressure, and makes people want to meet you. Unlike the boring “wyd” or forced flirty lines that flood TikTok.

Let’s break down 3 playful, low-key texts that almost always lead to a date (when there’s mutual attraction).

* **“Stop… you just gave me an idea.”**
* This opener creates *curiosity* without being cliché or cringey. You follow it with something like,
* “We should do a coffee taste test and settle the iced vs. hot debate once and for all,” or
* “Mildly tempted to challenge you to a museum art-off… loser buys gelato.”
* According to Hussey, playful banter that subtly frames a date as a shared *adventure* makes it more appealing. It’s not about *asking*, it’s about *imagining* together.
* Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert’s research on prediction and happiness (“Stumbling on Happiness”) shows we’re more likely to say yes to things that feel novel and lighthearted.
* **“Ok so do you get into debates during brunch or are you normal?”**
* This one’s gold. You’re teasing them playfully *while implying* a brunch date.
* It plays into what Hussey calls “assumptive flirting” you *pretend* the date is already happening.
* Studies by Dr. Arthur Aron (Stony Brook University) show that shared imagination and humor spike dopamine and connection even before people meet. Sneak that date idea in, don’t pitch it like a job interview.
* **“Not to be dramatic, but I just found our new go-to spot.”**
* You send this with a location (café, ramen place, bookstore bar whatever fits your vibe).
* Why it works: it’s bold *and* casual. You’re not begging for time, you’re offering a shared experience.
* Behavioral economist Dan Ariely talks about the “default bias”when you present something as a given, people are more willing to go along with it. You’re not saying, “Do you want to go?” You’re saying, “This should be ours.”

These lines aren’t magic spells. They work best when *you’ve already got a little spark*. But most people mess up by texting safe, boring stuff. These texts invite curiosity, play, and shared imagination which are the real drivers of attraction, according to multiple studies in *The Journal of Social and Personal Relationships*.

Is this expected? How do people typically run these models?,"I'm interested in understanding the capabilities of the latest VLA models, and seeing if I can quickly train my LeRobot SO-101 arms to do some simple, fun tasks. My first task to start with: ""pickup the green cube and drop it in the bowl"". I thought this might be a ""Hello, World!"" task that I could complete quickly with a pre-trained model, and then move on to other things, but it's been surprisingly challenging, and led me to a few questions.

**Pi0.5**

With a model like Pi0.5, described as a general VLA, [that can generalise to messy environments](https://www.pi.website/blog/pi05), I figured that I should be able to run my task on the arms, and see how it performs before doing any finetuning. This is a simple task, and a general adaptable model, so perhaps it'd be able to perform it straight away.

Running it on my M1 Pro MBP with 16GB of RAM, it took about 10 minutes to get started, then maxed out my computer memory and ultimately forced it to restart before any inference could happen. I reduced the camera output to a low enough frame size and fps down to 15 to help the performance, but even so, I had the same result. So this is my first learning -- these models require very high-spec hardware. M1 Pro MBP of course isn't the latest, and I'm happy to upgrade, but it surprised me that this was **far** beyond it's capabilities.

**SmolVLA**

So then I tried with SmolVLA base. This did run! Without any pre-training, the arms essentially go rigid, and then refuse to move from that position.

So this will require a lot of fine-tuning to work. But it's not clear to me if this is because:

* it doesn't understand the setup of the arms, possibly positions and relationships between motors etc.
* it hasn't seen my home and table environment and problem before

Or both of those things. If I was able to get Pi0.5 working, should my expectation be the same? That it would simply run, but fail to respond.

Or perhaps I'm doing something wrong, maybe there's a setup step I missed?

I was aware that of course that transformer models take a lot of processing power, but the impression I had from the various demos (tshirt folding, coffee making etc.) is that these robot arms were running autonomously, perhaps on their own hardware, or perhaps hooked up to a supporting machine. But my impression here is that they'd actually need to be hooked up to a REALLY BEEFY maxed out machine, in order to work.

Another option I considered is running this on a remote machine, with a service like runpod. My instinct is this would introduce too much latency. I'm wondering how others are handling these issues, and what people would recommend?

This then leads to bigger questions I'm more curious about: how humanoids like 1X and Optimus would be expected to work. With beefy GPUs and compute onboard, or perhaps operating from a local base station? Running inference remotely would surely have too much latency.",1,1769251269.0,AskRobotics,0,1.0,False

1qljrtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1qljrtk/toddler_behaviour/,Toddler behaviour,"My daughter is 35 months old. Overall she’s very verbal, imaginative, polite, and emotionally aware, but her play at home looks very different from some other kids her age, and that’s what’s been making me question things.

At home, she often doesn’t play with her toys, especially if they’re familiar. She’ll wander around the house, move from room to room, and sometimes whine if no adult is nearby.. She doesn’t do much self-initiated independent play with the toys she already has. If nothing interesting is happening, she kind of drifts. 

That said, if a toy is new — like a new play kitchen or coffee stand — she can play alone for hours. In those moments she invents long storylines and stays deeply engaged. She doesn’t jump from toy to toy; she locks into one scenario and plays it out for a long time. Her attention seems very interest-based. She can’t focus long on things she’s not interested in, but she can focus for long stretches on things she likes, especially pretend play or role play. She can also follow instructions well whether she is tired or not 

Socially, she does very well. At playgroup she politely asks to join other kids, waits her turn, and shares toys when guided. She can engage in playgroup play for over an hour. She sometimes gets frustrated if peers don’t comply, but she usually regulates with words instead of melting down. She notices when others are sad or crying and even reacts emotionally to scenes in movies. She asks questions like “Mommy, have you been happy?” which shows a lot of awareness of others’ feelings.

She loves pretend play, especially things like doctor, shopkeeper, or café scenarios, and can do this for 30 minutes or more, or much longer with new setups. She can make up stories from picture books. She doesn’t like other kids touching her toys, but she can share when prompted.

Emotionally, she’s very regulated. She has never hit, kicked, or scratched when upset. When she’s frustrated or overwhelmed, she might shriek, tense her body, or say “I don’t like that,” but she doesn’t physically act out. She startles if toddlers approach her quickly and sometimes becomes physically tense when emotionally overloaded. She also shows a lot of impulse control — for example, she asks permission to get up from the table instead of just leaving.

She sleeps really well and never put a fight to go to bed ever . She eats a wide variety of foods, including vegetables and homemade meals. 

Developmentally, she’s very verbal and imaginative, emotionally regulated, empathetic, and socially aware. She can play very deeply when something captures her interest, but she has limited interest in familiar toys at home and tends to wander when she’s under-stimulated.",0,1769250950.0,beyondthebump,4,0.5,False

And I got a letter last week. Where he wanted to ""explain"" - but it felt like a declaration of love without  commitment - and no real explanation. It hurts and confuses me so much.

I think I understand stuff rationally. But my heart is stuck... Please help me out here...

The letter basically said that he felt stupid about hurting me but wanted to explain. That he put me on a pedestal when we met, and that he still feels that way about me. That he thinks I am fantastic - empathetic, smart, beautiful, endearing, courageous, \[*Insert more meaningful compliments here*\]...

He told me I didnt do anything wrong but that he was so happy when he was with me that he put me first and forgot his own needs, even when I asked about them. He now realized that was a mistake because he forgot himself and was unaware he became quite frustrated with himself. He realized this was something he needed to work on. That he needs to learn to take care of his ""inner child"". He got a tattoo to not forget that... He wrote how super grateful he was for me, and for learning this with me. And how he hoped we could, after my pain settled, grab coffee and laugh about the good old times and tell each other everything about what we are doing on our ""**separate** **paths**"". - With lots of love, Him....

What am I supposed to do with that? My god... it feels so loving and like we are still connected. But there is nothing about actually getting back together...

First of all, how does this explain breaking up instead of working on it together? 

I do think I might understand it as part of his avoidant patterns. But I am so frustrated he sees his choice to leave as selfcare while I feel like he is running away (*Its also the second time, but back then he came back in a week*). My heart still wants him to fight. But I feel like Ive been fighting for the two of us too long. Im exhausted...

You know, he was the first person I ever felt fully at home with. He felt like my true safe space where I felt seen and always welcome with every part of me. Our relationship was filled with depth, warmth, lightness, laughter and deep intuitive emotional resonance.... From his letter I feel like he thinks we can continue that bond without any relationship. But I dont feel any part of him seems to understand the depth of what he actually did by breaking up with me. How much that hurts... and How I still want a relationship, and I don't think I can see him normally and dont see a friendship continuing where it left off.

I feel like Ive been focused so much on trying to understand and wanting him to see his patterns... 

I probably need to accept he did actually decide to drop me, instead of working on it with me. And that lack of insight still wouldnt relieve him from the accountability of his choice. 

Its just, I can say all that. And still I yearn for him. Because he was a wonderful person and partner when he was present. And because I don't really trust that I can find someone I like that much again, with that depth. What if I never resonate that deeply again? 

Do you guys have any thoughts to share with my tender heart? Am i missing something here?

Should I take the carrot of being friends or whatever hope his letter instills or try to move on? How do I trust theres a better future for me? Will he realise he made a mistake some day? What the hell is happening... Any thoughts welcome..

I felt like that was the reason she didn't go and I got mad, told her I had to hang up to go do something. What got me more upset was that my daughter being excited to start taking clients and my friend not saying she wasn't going to keep the appointment until I reached out to her was the thing that upset me at that time. Oh and all she was going in for was a manicure. Today though, she went to get her hair dyed at the school she usually goes to and still says, maybe I should of gone with your daughter for it, I feel bad. I don't get what the difference between a stranger doing her hair or nails, it's still a student either at that school or with my daughter. So it wasn't that she was new to having a service done by a student or that she was nervous about the level of experience by the student. They're all there learning and under supervision. I even told her that she'd get a discount at my daughter's school. I just find it weird that she went elsewhere eventhough she asked to get booked and it'll be a student no matter what. Is it just because it was my daughter or what would you think? ",1,1769250797.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,0.99,False

1qljq7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/classifiedsph/comments/1qljq7g/for_hire_virtual_corporate_chef_for_small_fb_rd/,[For Hire] Virtual Corporate Chef for Small F&B. R&D + Systems + Costing,"Hi everyone,

I’m opening up slots for small restaurant/cafe owners who need high-level culinary direction but can't afford to hire a full-time Executive Chef (which usually costs ₱70k - ₱100k++).

**Who I am:**

* **5 Years as Corporate Chef** for a popular Italian restaurant chain here in PH (I know operations, scaling, and consistency).
* **Former Personal Chef to the Former Spanish Ambassador** to the Philippines (I know high-end quality).
* Specialist in **R&D (Research & Development)** I don't just cook; I engineer menus that sell and are profitable.
* **11 Years Total Industry Experience.**
* **Currently acting as an F&B Director for known restaurants and bars around the Metro.**
* More experience available upon contacting me.

**The Problem:** Most small food businesses fail because they have great ideas but poor execution. You might be losing money on food costs, your menu might be too big/confusing, or your kitchen workflow is slow. You don't need a full-time chef standing there 12 hours a day, you need a strategist to set the systems and recipes.

**The Solution:** I am offering a **Virtual Corporate Chef** package. For a fixed, affordable monthly fee, I act as your culinary partner. We work 100% remotely. You provide the vision, I provide the corporate-grade systems to make it work.

**What you get:**

* **Menu Engineering:** Review of your current menu to identify high-profit vs. dead-weight items.
* **R&D:** Development of 1-2 new monthly specials sent to you as a complete deployment kit (Recipe + Costing).
* **Food Cost Audit:** I will calculate the *actual* food cost of your top sellers to ensure you are actually making money.
* **Supplier Access:** I can recommend suppliers I’ve trusted for a decade to help you lower costs.
* **On-Call Consultation:** Direct line to me for kitchen emergencies or troubleshooting.

**Who is this for?**

* Coffee shop owners who want to expand into hot meals but don't know how.
* Small restaurant owners struggling with consistency or high wastage.
* Home-based food businesses looking to scale up to a physical store.

**Why Remote?**

* It is significantly cheaper for you. You aren't paying for my commute or physical presence.
* It forces your team to learn the *system* rather than relying on a chef to hover over them.

**The Deal:**

* **Price:** 10,000php per month per brand.
* **Terms:** Retainer fee is paid **upfront** at the start of the month. No lock-in period, but I only take on a limited number of clients to ensure quality.

I bridge the gap between ""home cook"" passion and ""corporate chain"" profitability.

**Interested?** Send me a DM with a brief description of your business (concept, location, and current biggest struggle). Let’s schedule a quick chat to see if we’re a fit.",1,1769250786.0,classifiedsph,1,1.0,False

I hope so either way it worked out while I waited it out for my pills to kick in 😂,"I think it’s a bad reading but my BP kicked up from my usual 125/90 with propranolol and spiro. I drank coffee and ate lasagna the day before tons of stress at new job the high readings were 166/110 before coming back down to 125/90 after I took more of my BP pill and an anxiety pill. I got some anxiety sometimes it just kicks in out of nowhere 😂. 

Imagine someone with a straight face at a supermarket pretending their body is not going ape shit for no reason then breathing in and out until it goes away or it’s a heart attack either way it’s win win 😂

Went back and did 5 min of light drybrush on the Communicant so it sucks less now. Took 5,5 hours in total spread over 5 days and 6 short painting sessions, not longer than an hour. So what did we learn, it is OK and fun to paint in short increments and to a lower quality than what I'm used to. It hits the hobby fix spot just enough.   
Idea was to fast paint a band to giveaway as one of the prizes for a local tournament. This is my try at smallest competitive list to start a campaign with. For tournament play you need to squeeze in as many Martyrdom Pills as you can:

# The Strategic Edge of Sector 91

What makes a [**residential property in Sector 91 Gurgaon**](https://www.trueassetsconsultancy.com/properties/residential-property-in-sector-91-gurgaon) so appealing isn't just the brick and mortar—it's the geography.

This means whether you’re heading to the IGI Airport or the corporate offices in Cyber City, you have multiple routes to beat the rush.
