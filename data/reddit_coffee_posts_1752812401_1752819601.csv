1m2usug,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m2usug/unit_3a_keeps_eating_my_tenants/,Unit 3A Keeps Eating My Tenants,"I’ve been having a lot of trouble sleeping, and keeping all of this to myself.



I tried to talk to my family- who immediately disowned me- so here I turn to a community that might understand. I’m not sure I’m real anymore, or what isn’t, or what is. The swirling enigmas and holes in time that rewind my emotions like the hands of a drunken clock blend the world together and drain my attention.

Lately I’m unaware- tethered to reality by things so unusual they shock me back into existence, as if I were a recently reanimated Benjamin Franklin performing the famous kite experiment in a storm that billows like stuffing between the tattered threads of an ancient voodoo doll from an alternate universe.

It was during one such moment- one of those brief electrical jolts back into clarity- that I found myself standing in front of the first property on a list. I’ve seen a lot of places by now, but this one was different. On the outside, it smelled of antique candle wax, and the floorboards screamed like drowning pigeons. Upon unlocking the front door, the scent of the rusty old iron key pressed against my palm paired well with the echoing cough of a lawyer who had definitely been dead for several decades, but still insisted on shaking my hand like a wet rag.

“I presume you are Jonas Zissman,” he said without asking, like someone proclaiming the weather or commenting on the state of traffic.

I am certainly Jonas Zissman. That’s what the charred papyrus envelope said when it slipped under my door three nights ago at precisely 3:33 a.m. (coincidentally, the exact time and date of my birth), postmarked from “Elsewhere and Anyplace.” My own name was scrawled in ink that smelled faintly of my childhood attic and pressure-cooked roadkill. I had been instructed to arrive at the very building that stood before me at exactly this time.

According to the note, I had died exactly 1,111 years ago, choked to death by a cursed Fabergé egg during a séance-themed brunch in Prague. The physical will (which was handwritten in very angry Latin and some kind of red fungus that seemed to grow and write sentences before my very eyes) declared me the sole heir to:

“Every property ever acquired, sold, built or condemned, haunted or otherwise, inhabited by the supernatural.”

“Congratulations,” the decaying lawyer continued. “You now own 66,666.6 structures, spanning 666 jurisdictions, including at least three³ that exist outside linear time.”

He then handed me a skeleton key the size of a goat’s femur.



The first of those properties I visited was called “The Hovel of Gentle Agonies”, as indicated by a beautiful hand-carved stone plaque at the end of a long, overgrown driveway.

The Hovel was in southern New Hampshire, perched on a cliff like a cow waiting to leap over the blood moon. I walked through the door and immediately, a soft choir of anguish began- like a demon’s yoga student trying to mask the chronic pain of slightly inhuman contortion caused by the evil spirit that possessed them. It wasn’t loud. Just… persistent.

The wallpaper sighed when I touched it.

The plumbing wept during the night.

The coffee table giggled when I thumped my shin.

The mirrors refused to reflect me unless I first apologized for kicking the table.

I lived there for three days before the lamps began whispering my name backward, and I decided I should probably visit a property more charming.



I mapped my new real estate empire across a massive wall in my new “office,” to which I had laid claim inside of an abandoned lighthouse off the coast of Rhode Island. Its only tenant was a taxidermied clam named Mr. Gait, who offered unsolicited advice during thunderstorms. I taped Polaroids to the bricks with adhesive bandages -paid as rent from a mummy in room 216 of my New York apartments- and wrote notes in lipstick stolen from an angry bigfoot I accidentally evicted in Maine.

Every property had rules.

At the “Estate of Rotting Clocks”, time moves slower the more you panic.

At “Mr. Venaire’s Farmhouse”, the stairs always lead deeper if you happen to smell rosemary.

“The Chateau of Forgotten Dreams” will only let you in if you pretend to faint.

I started sleeping less and drawing more.

A pet fish I hadn’t seen since childhood (Larry) began showing up in different rooms of the properties, always just out of reach. Sometimes swimming among chandeliers, held aloft only by dust carried from an impossible breeze. Other times, he would be flailing quietly on a cursed chiffarobe. Once, I found him submerged in a fresh casserole made of icy jello and swollen shrimps, his black eyes looking upward like he’d seen something I could not.



I’m not sure when the comedy began.

Maybe it was the moment I realized none of the ghosts could actually hurt me- they had certainly tried. But they quickly realized I always carried a yoyo and several harmonicas.

Or maybe it was when I inherited the duplex in Salem that bled molasses during the solstices and demanded daily affirmations in Hebrew.

There’s something undeniably hilarious about being screamed at by a 17th-century poltergeist who just wants you to appreciate his woodworkings of tiny little fairies.

Still, between the laughter, there are moments. Dark ones.

Moments where I wake up to find my own footprints circling my bed, and my bloody fingerprints sealing letters to properties I haven’t yet visited. Where letters arrive written in my own handwriting, addressed to “the other Jonas.”

Moments where the police show up at one of the many doors I lay behind, asking what happened to so-and-so or what’s-their-name.

That’s the part that haunts me- the thing that really keeps me awake.

  


# Unit 3A.

  


There is an old building in Southie that’s ninety-nine percent normal.

That’s the worst part, really. Normalcy has a way of putting you to sleep just before the nightmare slithers under your skin.

I own the entire place -a modest brick structure with charming leaded windows and a history of quiet despair. I let tenants believe it’s a rent-controlled relic from the ’60s, untouched by gentrification and ghosts.

It’s mostly true.

I hire a small team for logistics and maintenance, and the place runs itself. Unlike the shrieking houseboat in Delaware or the Pregnant Tomb I own in Finland, this one is downright pleasant. No bleeding pipes. No gravity anomalies. I even get paid in money -real bills and checks, not the eyeglasses of blind butterflies or snake hands, which I still have in a shoebox somewhere, collecting a mild stench and stronger aura.

But every year, on the 76th day -at exactly 1:23 a.m. -the building changes its mind about being normal.

I don’t hear it directly. The walls do. The plumbing does. My tenants do. Sometimes even the rats write things in the dust that say things like:

“Not again.”

“Why does it scream so long?”

It sounds like a horse. Or someone becoming a horse. Screaming -not in the panicked, shallow way, but in the slow, endless way reserved for those who see their own death coming through a keyhole.

Some say it sounds like burning. Others say it’s wet, like something being unzipped the wrong way. One time, someone claimed they could hear galloping right before the sound cut off completely. Another claimed the galloping came after.

Always, it’s followed by a phone call.

  

“It’s happened again.”

“Apartment 3A.”

“They’re gone.”



I always make a trip to Boston the next morning. Not by car or train -Mr. Gait, my accountant/clam statue who can only speak in compound interest rates, recently installed a new access door that floats just over the railing of the Rhode Island lighthouse I use as a summer office.

It opens into the boiler room of the Southie building. I try not to question how this works. Gait once told me it was a “spatial tax write-off.”

Once I arrive, I climb the stairs, nod to the janitor with gills, who is always drinking the last of the bottled salt water I provide the staff, and ascend toward the heart of the building.

By then, the cleanup crew -clad in hazmat suits with antlers carved into their plastic hoods -is already on their way out. They carry bulging bags they never let me see into, muttering phrases like:

“Voluntary de-chimerization.”

“Residual gallop.”

Apartment 3A is always open. It never locks. You can weld it shut or board it up, and somehow the door still swings wide the next time it’s needed.

The first thing I feel isn’t the smell -though it’s there, thick and metallic, like singed bone marrow and spilled paint.

It’s the silence.

A silence so deep it feels like you’re underwater inside your own brain.

Then the air changes.

The light dims, even though there are no windows. Sometimes the ceiling breathes. Sometimes the ceiling stares.

The walls speak, but not in English. Not in anything shaped like words. They emit a sound like the throat of someone holding back tears underwater—the voice of a memory that forgot how to survive.

Still, I understand the message.



Feed me.



I never bring food.

I never plan to feed it.

But every time I stand there, something happens. That dread -that coiling, buzzing thing in my gut -begins to unspool. I get dizzy. I remember things I shouldn’t. Every embarrassing moment of my childhood arrives uninvited-

knocking my lunch off the table in second grade, calling my teacher “mom” twice in one week, wetting the bed on the overnight trip to the aquarium and trying to blame it on the fish tanks.

The room knows.

It feasts first on shame.

Sometimes I hear a second voice behind me, but when I turn around, it’s just Larry- the ghost of my childhood fish- propped up on the radiator, his shiny silver scales glinting in the dark like disapproving stars. His fins are outstretched like he’s waiting to be hugged… or maybe crucified. I don’t know how he gets here, but I don’t ask anymore. He’s always clean and freshly shaven, like someone’s taking care of him.

Eventually, something always clicks- inside me or in the room, I can’t tell. A thought that isn’t mine floats up and plants itself. It tells me who to send next.

“Apartment 2B,” the thought says. “He hasn’t paid rent in weeks. 3A is an upgrade for him.”

And that’s how I know the room is still hungry.

They say legacy is what we leave behind. But what if it’s what we inherit by mistake? What if every property is just another version of myself locked behind deadbolts and plaster, screaming gently?

I long for any distinction between what I am and what I become. Between jokes and omens. Between the keys in my pocket and the places they insist I return to.

For now, I will roam. I continue to catalogue. I sleep in clawfoot tubs and sing lullabies to doors before I open them.

And wherever I go, I’ll write about it.

Surely, someone else here has been to one of my buildings. Maybe one of my lots, or garages. One of the many libraries or graveyards. If you have, please give me some updates.

I can only do so much, and I’d hate to make my tenants angry.

Every day that I’m at work, I will normally take a shit around 11-12 to make room for lunch. I drink a lot of coffee in the morning, and I usually have a really big protein shake before I leave the house. As you might be able to guess, this makes quite a witch’s brew in my stomach after fermenting for a few hours, and I will fully admit to dropping growlers in the work bathroom. 

A few weeks ago, I got called into HR for the first time about the smell. The head of HR told me the CFO has been in the bathroom after me on multiple occasions and I guess the odor is so bad that he has been getting nauseous and distracted from doing his work after lunch. I apologized and said I would try to make sure to flush more frequently. 

The second time I got called into HR was about a week after that. Some dude went into the stall right after me and complained to HR that I “made the wall behind the toilet into a Jackson Pollock painting.” They said I need to clean up after myself and wanted to make sure I understood the bathroom is a space that everyone should be able to use.

The *third* time I got called into HR was yesterday. They gave me a written warning because (in the head of HR’s words) I’m “ruining the bathroom for everybody else.” Apparently the head of HR himself had come into the bathroom after I had left what I call a porcelain lasagna in one of the toilets. I won’t go into details but use your imagination. Anyway, they said I’m on really thin ice and if there are any more bathroom related complaints against me I will have to find another job.

I’m just really scared because we just bought a house and had another kid and my son has an ant farm I’m worried I won’t be able to provide stability for my family because everyone at work doesn’t like the way I do my damage ",1,1752819262.0,complaints,1,1.0,False

""Good morning."" I wrapped my fingers around my coffee mug, glancing at my mate across the breakfast table.  
  
  
Ronan Cross sat there studying me in nothing but a thin nightgown, his amber eyes still burning with that primal hunger from full moon.  
  
  
""Morning."" I set down my cup, reminding him, ""Don't you have that pack meeting today?""  
  
  
""Yeah."" Ronan smirked, pushing back from his chair and stalking over to me. ""The boys can wait for their Luna. Besides, we're working on the pack's heir.""  
  
  
Before I could say anything, his mouth crashed against mine, tongue demanding entry as his fingers slipped beneath my panties.  
  
  
My knees went weak as I breathed against his lips, ""Ronan...""  
  
  
He cleared the table with one sweep of his arm, plates crashing to the floor. Then freed his cock, the tip already slick as he positioned himself between my spread legs.  
  
  
I wrapped my legs around his waist, meeting each of his powerful thrusts as he pounded into me.  
  
  
After thirty minutes, Ronan buried himself deep and came hard inside me.  
  
  
He kissed me lazily, then gave my ass a firm squeeze. ""Meeting shouldn't take long. I'll bring the guys back for dinner ."" His voice softened slightly: ""And babe? Don’t forget your antidepressants.""  
  
  
I rolled my eyes, tugging my nightgown back down. ""Such a nag.""  
  
  
He flashed those sharp canines in a grin before heading out to the pack house. I stayed slumped against the table, legs still trembling, but smiling despite myself.  
  
  
I prepared a small gathering for him and Rowan, his beta.  
  
  
Later that night, when his beta arrived, I went to change my clothes—only to overhear their conversation.  
  
  
At the dinner table, Ronan’s beta suddenly switched to Italian.  
  
  
""Three years ago, you took Lyra as your Luna just to get her to forgive Mira. I've watched Lyra fall deeper for you every day, but you're still lying to her—passing off birth control pills as antidepressants. Aren’t you afraid she will lose it once she finds out the truth?""  
  
  
Ronan paused, his face clouded with a complex expression before a wry, bitter smile curved his lips. ""A pup I don't want doesn't need to exist. As for Lyra... as long as she stops interfering with Mira's happiness, I'll honor my commitment to protect her for life.""  
  
  
No one knew that I had long since learned Italian and understood every word they said.  
  
  
I stood in the living room, his fresh bite mark still throbbing on my neck, holding the bottle of my 'antidepressants.'  
  
  
So all the love he showed me… was only a lie.  
  
  
What I thought was my salvation had been nothing but a crafted trap.  
  
  
I didn't hesitate. I swallowed the pills—they tasted more bitter than ever before.  
  
  
The conversation at the dinner table continued, Rowan's voice low and heavy with guilt  
  
  
“Forget the whole pup situation for a second—three years ago, when Mira jumped into that river, Lyra’s mom dove in to save her. But Mira shoved her under and let her drown. Ronan, come on, the footage was clear as day. She did it on purpose. Lyra had every right to take it to the pack court.”  
  
  
""But you became Lyra's legal guardian just to keep Mira out of prison. You signed that settlement behind Lyra's back. Sure, Mira walked free, but Lyra's been drowning in depression ever since. She blames herself every single day. If she ever learns the truth, it'll destroy her completely.""  
  
  
Ronan's eyes flashed with irritation, but his voice stayed cold and firm. ""Mira didn't mean it. She was drowning—those movements were just instinct. She regrets it too.""  
  
  
""I've hidden those documents well. Lyra will never know the truth. I'll be good to her, spend my life making it up to her, give her a home. She'll forget the pain. She'll heal.""  
  
  
Rowan sighed. “Look, don’t blow up—I just feel bad for Lyra, that’s all. You showed up when she was at rock bottom, and of course she fell for you. But you were never over Mira.”  
  
  
“Whatever, man. Just... hope you can live with this secret. And I hope you won't regret it.”  
  
  
Ronan drained his glass, each word deliberate: ""I will never regret it.""  
  
  
That one sentence—“I will never regret it”—tore apart the last of my illusions like sharp claws.  
  
  
Tomorrow was New Year's Eve. The streets buzzed with celebration.  
  
  
Just this morning, Ronan had fucked me senseless, his teeth at my throat, saying how much he loved me.  
  
  
Now every word felt like a blade cutting me open.  
  
  
I collapsed on a park bench, tears streaming down my face.  
  
  
All those buried memories came flooding back.  
  
  
Mira loved my ex mate Evan desperately. The day he and I got engaged, she couldn't handle it—left a suicide note and jumped into the river.  
  
  
Even though Mira was a strong swimmer and my father's bastard daughter, my mother still dove in to save her.  
  
  
So many people filmed it. I watched my mother lift Mira toward the surface, only for Mira to press down on her shoulders, use her feet to push my mother's head underwater.  
  
  
That's how my mother drowned.  
  
  
When I arrived, Mira cried pitifully: ""I just lost my head for a moment, sis. Please don't blame me. When mom saved me, she must have wanted me to live well...""  
  
  
I broke down, demanding to know why she'd pushed my mother underwater when she could swim perfectly well. She just kept crying, insisting it wasn't intentional.  
  
  
I sued her for murder.

But I don’t know if I can take him seriously. Something feels off.,"I (26F) broke up with my bf (28M) and we are currently working on things. But something just doesn’t feel “right” and I can’t take him seriously.

So like the title says my bf (28M) and I (26F) broke up 3 months ago, initiated by me. We were together for 6 years. 

Essentially, my bf had always been a homebody. This wasn’t a problem. I tend to take people as they are - so if I’m with someone who’s a homebody this isn’t really a big deal to me. 

But, eventually for the last 6 months of our relationship I noticed my bf became more than a homebody. He became avoidant and put 0 effort into the relationship. 

We stopped going out together, he wouldn’t call me for days, he wouldn’t initiate to hang out for days sometimes weeks, and when we did see each other it was for a very short time. 

The other thing that began to happen was he became kinda “mean” like he would ditch me for his friends, he’d be like “don’t ever ask me to go grocery shopping with you - I hate that.”, and he’d also exclude me. So one time we stopped at Tim Hortons and his sister asked him for a coffee. He got one for her. I asked “hey can you grab me one as well pls?” And he went “no. I’m not getting you anything. You can pay.” In this very sharp tone. I never ask him to pay for anything. I’ve gotten him food and coffee before.

That’s when I started to feel like he just maybe was falling out of love. We live separately. I live on my own and he lives with his parents. He doesn’t want to move out with me, or at all. 

So I broke up with him. At that point we barely spoke. I did have several conversations prior about how I felt. I wrote a 3 page letter about how I felt like our relationship meant nothing anymore. He apologized but didn’t take it very seriously. 

After I broke up with him, he shows up at my door with flowers and says he’s done a complete 180 and is ready to be there for me.

Since then, he has initiated more hang outs and does call more. He seems to be more present. But at the same time, has admitted resenting me for breaking up with him when everything was “fine” according to him. 

We’ve been working on things…but in the 6 years I’ve been with him I have never seen him *this* present before in our relationship. 

It feels off because why did I have to break up with him just to get him to realize he should call and hang out with me? Is this gonna last long term?? Is he only doing this to keep me around and that’s it?? It’s raising so many questions and I honestly am just confused by everything. When I bring this up to him, he just goes “I was always like this you just didn’t see it. I was in a slump.” 

But it wasn’t just a slump. It was months of him not even calling me for days even tho I’d call him. Months of him being short and rude to me. Months of him feeling annoyed cause I wanna see him. 

I just am not sure if I can really take him seriously. I honestly felt like he just hated me at the end of it. Now all the sudden it’s the opposite? 

**TL;DR** my bf and I broke up after he stoped putting effort into our relationship for months. He was avoidant. Once I left him, he’s done a complete 180 but idk how to take him seriously cause if I never left him he’d prob still never wanna see me or talk to me.

## Key Features Analysis

Selecting the perfect 9x12 area rug involves understanding its key features and how they contribute to its overall quality,durability,and aesthetic appeal.Numerous elements affect the rug's suitability, from its material composition to its construction method.

**Material:** The material of a 9x12 area rug significantly impacts its durability, feel, and maintenance requirements. Common materials include wool, synthetic fibers like nylon and polyester, and natural fibers like cotton, jute, and sisal. Wool rugs are known for their luxurious feel,resilience,and ability to resist stains,making them a premium choice for high-traffic areas. Synthetic rugs offer affordability and easy maintenance, while natural fiber rugs provide a rustic, textured look. Before selecting a rug, carefully understand the trade-offs between price, durability, and maintenance.

**Construction:** The method of construction affects the rug's texture,thickness,and longevity. Common construction types include hand-knotted, hand-tufted, machine-made, and flatweave. Hand-knotted rugs are the most labor-intensive and valuable, featuring intricate designs, exceptional durability, and a higher price tag. Hand-tufted rugs offer a similar look at a lower cost but may not be as durable as hand-knotted options. machine-made rugs offer uniformity and affordability, while flatweave rugs lack a pile, making them easy to clean and ideal for high-traffic areas.

**Pile Height:** The pile height refers to the length of the rug's fibers, influencing its comfort and appearance. Rugs with low pile (less than 0.25 inches) are easy to clean and suitable for high-traffic areas, while rugs with high pile (over 0.5 inches) offer a plush, comfortable feel. The desired pile height depends on your personal preferences and the room's function; high pile rugs are often best in low-traffic areas, while low pile rugs are ideal in dining rooms or entryways.

**Density:** The density of the rug refers to how tightly the fibers are packed together. Higher density rugs are generally more durable and resilient, offering better resistance to wear and tear. When assessing a rug's density, look for tightly packed fibers that spring back quickly when pressed down.higher density rugs may have a slightly higher price tag but offer better long-term value.

**Design and Pattern:** With a 9x12 rug becoming a focal point, its color, pattern, and overall design are crucial elements to consider.From traditional Persian patterns to modern geometric designs, the options are virtually limitless. Consider the existing color scheme and décor of the room when choosing a rug; a rug with vibrant colors and bold patterns can add personality, while a rug with neutral tones and subtle textures can create a calm, sophisticated atmosphere.

**Backing:** The rug backing is another crucial aspect, as it provides stability and prevents slipping. common backing materials include latex, cotton, and jute.Latex backing offers excellent grip but may not be suitable for individuals with latex allergies. Cotton backing is a natural and hypoallergenic alternative, while jute backing provides a more textured and rustic feel. Rug pads are frequently enough recommended nonetheless of the backing material to extend the rug's lifespan, prevent slipping, and provide extra cushioning.

## Core Benefits

A 9x12 area rug isn't just a decorative piece; it offers numerous practical benefits that enhance the comfort and functionality of your living space. Understanding these core benefits can help you make an informed decision and choose a rug that meets your specific needs.**Enhanced Room Aesthetics:** A strategically chosen 9x12 area rug can dramatically enhance the aesthetic appeal of a room.By introducing color,pattern,and texture,it can tie together different elements and create a cohesive and stylish look. For example,placing a vibrant,patterned rug in a neutral-toned living room can instantly add personality and visual interest. Similarly, a rug with subtle textures and earthy tones can create a warm and inviting atmosphere in a bedroom.

**Improved Comfort and Warmth:** Rugs provide a soft and comfortable surface for walking, playing, and relaxing. Especially during colder months, a 9x12 area rug can add warmth and insulation to a room with hardwood or tile flooring. Consider choosing a rug with a high pile or a wool material for extra softness and warmth underfoot. Walking barefoot on a plush rug can provide a luxurious experience and reduce the impact on your joints.

**Noise Reduction:** Area rugs can absorb sound waves, reducing noise levels and echoes in a room. This is particularly beneficial in large, open-concept spaces or apartments where noise travels easily. A thick, dense rug can significantly dampen sounds, creating a quieter and more peaceful environment. This can make a significant difference in settings such as family rooms where multiple activities may take place at once.

**Floor Protection:** Rugs protect your flooring from scratches, dents, and other damage caused by furniture and foot traffic. Placing a 9x12 area rug beneath a dining table or sofa can definitely help preserve the condition of your hardwood or tile floors, extending their lifespan and maintaining their appearance. rug pads provide an extra layer of protection, preventing the rug from slipping and further safeguarding the flooring beneath.

**Defining and Anchoring Spaces:** A large area rug can effectively define and anchor a specific area within a larger room. As a notable example,in an open-concept living room and dining area,a 9x12 area rug can visually separate the seating area from the dining space,creating distinct zones within the room. This is particularly useful in spaces where multiple functions take place.

## FAQs Section

Selecting and maintaining a 9x12 area rug can raise several questions. Here are a few common inquiries with detailed answers to guide your decision:

**What is the ideal rug placement for a 9x12 area rug in a living room?**
The ideal rug placement depends on the room size and furniture arrangement. In general, a 9x12 rug should be large enough to anchor all major furniture pieces, such as sofas, chairs, and coffee tables. Ideally, the front legs of the sofa and chairs should rest on the rug, creating a unified and inviting seating area. If the room is smaller, leaving some space between the rug and the walls can create a sense of spaciousness.

**How frequently enough should a 9x12 area rug be professionally cleaned?**
The frequency of professional cleaning depends on the rug’s material, traffic level, and pet ownership. Generally, area rugs should be professionally cleaned every 12 to 18 months to remove deeply embedded dirt and stains.Though, high-traffic areas or homes with pets or small children may require more frequent cleaning. Regular vacuuming and spot cleaning can definitely help extend the time between professional cleanings.

**What type of rug pad is best for a 9x12 area rug?**
A high-quality rug pad is essential for protecting both your rug and your flooring. The best type of rug pad depends on the type of flooring. For hardwood floors, choose a rug pad made of felt or rubber, wich provides cushioning and prevents slippage without damaging the finish. For carpeted floors, a thinner rug pad with a gripping surface is ideal for preventing the rug from bunching or sliding. Always select a rug pad that is slightly smaller than the rug to allow for proper ventilation.

**How can I prevent my 9x12 area rug from fading in direct sunlight?**
Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can cause the colors in your area rug to fade over time. to minimize fading, consider using curtains or blinds to filter sunlight during peak hours. Rotating the rug periodically can also help ensure even exposure to sunlight, preventing uneven fading. alternatively, choose rugs made from fade-resistant materials, such as synthetic fibers or solution-dyed wool.

Disclosure: Using information and good news from the past 4 months (News Source - https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BZAI/). I condensed the information (using a little ChatGPT) and edited portions of it for correctness and clarity. This article also talks about the total addressable market (TAM) of 100B in a very unique full stack AI market and BZAI is positioning itself into taking it all!

For starters, BZAI (https://www.blaize.com/) provides purpose-built AI edge computing solutions :

* Through its proprietary Graph Streaming Processor (GSP) architecture and low-/no-code software platform. 
* It provides a \*\*full stack solution (\*\*i.e. both hardware **AND** software) focused on low-power consumption chips for AI at the hands of the user (edge computing, e.g. an AI powered coffee maker or saving lives using surgical robots).

Don't believe me? Try programming a Nvidia Jetson for AI, you'll see the trouble in decreasing power consumption while maintaining top performance. FPGA coding alone will make you run away, haha. All you VHDL/Verilog fans out there, no disrespect :). These factors alone makes BZAI **an unique and distinct edge-AI provider in the market!! None like it!**

There is so much growth here! With a **TAM(Total Addressable Market) of over** **$100B**, and the near-term revenue traction already exceeding **$170M** in announced contracts in **2025** alone! Projecting at least **10$++ by EoY 2025 and 20$ for 2026!** Perfect value for money!!

Since Jan 2025 after the pre-SPAC merger with BWI, BZAI raised over $330M from major strategic investors (e.g., DENSO, Samsung, Mercedes-Benz), Blaize targets scalable AI adoption across public infrastructure, national security, industrial IoT, and telecom.

Hi everyone, I’m Rusnė Kuliešiūtė ([www.12sheep.com](http://www.12sheep.com)). I’m a certified sleep psychologist specializing in CBT-I - the most effective method for treating chronic insomnia (and no, it’s not about meditation or cutting coffee).

I work with people who’ve been struggling for months or years, often after they’ve tried pills, supplements, podcasts, sleep hygiene, and still can’t sleep through the night.

I’ve also had severe insomnia myself. I know what it’s like to dread bedtime, fear 3AM wake-ups, and feel like your body has forgotten how to sleep. One of the basic things that everyone else seems to do effortlessly.

Now I help others rebuild their sleep system. Nothing fluffy. Just behavioural tools that work.

Ask me anything:

* Why sleep hygiene doesn’t fix chronic insomnia
* What CBT-I actually involves
* Why does insomnia get worse the harder I try to sleep?
* What actually happens in a CBT-I session?
* Why do I wake up at 3 a.m. every night?
* Does sleep restriction mean I have to suffer more?
* What if I’ve already tried everything?

1m2ug1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1m2ug1i/tell_me_anyway/,Tell Me Anyway,"The terrifying call I took the other day has led to a meeting and further steps onto a winding path that very likely leads away from you. 

I attended the meeting and have begun walking the unknown, unsteady path that winds away. I’ve been brave about it and not shown my fear despite how inwardly terrified I am of the way ahead and how alone I’m going to be down that road. 

Not at first. Not really. I know that at first I’ll still be able to hear you on the wind when you call out your reassurances and I know that at first I’ll be able to still see you in the distance and communicate and that our paths are likely to still get close enough that we more-or-less cross and interact. Probably not as regularly. In time, however, I’ll be too distant from you and it will be so much sooner than I’m ready for and it makes my insides twist painfully. 

It makes me feel nervous and ill to face something so new and uncertain alone. 

But I know you so well and I know what you’d say and my other inner voice that sounds like you when I need encouragement is easily findable. I know what you’d tell me if you were sitting across from me now: 

“Don’t you think maybe you’ve worked too hard for all this self-doubt?” most likely, or possibly something like “I’m proud of you, young lady; you should be too. You’ve worked hard.” Since you know that sometimes I need someone else to give me permission first or that I need to follow. 

You’d remind me that it’s a path we’ve both been wanting to arrive for me, and that you’d never doubted its existence even though I had. You’d remind me that of the people who matter, it’s only myself who doesn’t see my strength and the fact that I’ve already begun down the new road only shows how far I’ve come and that maybe I should rethink my stance. 

You’d remind me that you’re not actually that far from reach and that it’s the same self-doubt making me feel ill about the new path that prevents me from reaching out to you and telling you all of this in the first place and that the bravery I’ve mustered to take the new journey, should also be channeled to ‘just get in touch when you need to; you are allowed to call’. 

But I won’t. We both know I won’t. Because amongst all my self-doubt, I can’t help but doubt you too. Too many lies from too many people who were supposed to care for far too long circle my head and prevent me from believing that I do anything but take up space and be a nuisance. So I stay silent in the quiet corners and gaps and hope that you think of me as fondly as I think of you. 

And sometimes I think you read the letters that I throw to the void because like everyone else, sometimes the letters I see in the void written by others seem like they could be for me even though I know they’re not. I don’t delude myself into thinking they are, I really don’t think any of them would be. I’ve said before that I really don’t think I cross your mind more than absolutely necessary, let alone enough to scream into the void about me. But if you did I’d hope it would be easier for me to know it was you. That you’d want me to know. 

But you wouldn’t. We both know you wouldn’t. That you can’t. That would be a genuinely terrible life choice for you. Besides, like I said: I know what you’d tell me in this situation and your direct reassurance in the moment isn’t essential. I can get it when I next see you and you’ll say exactly what I knew you would and it validates my self-reassurance and that my Inner You was accurately portrayed. 

That said, I’d like to hear it anyway. I’d like you to tell me anyway. It’s the biggest change in my life in so long and I’m terrified of it all falling apart and even though I know damn well that if you were sitting across from me with a coffee and smile you’d be saying “It’s okay. It’s going to be fine. You’re going to be amazing and everything is going to finally start coming together in the way you’ve worked for. It’s okay, and you will still be able to reach for me.” I still want to hear it. Or see it. In the moment, now, while I feel so uprooted and unsettled and like I might go to pieces. 

What a relief I’m a realist, and that I know what you’d say. Because you won’t be in touch and even if you would be in this situation, you won’t know I want or need you too. You aren’t reading my words thrown to the ether, you don’t actually know about the terrifying new path yet; and I thankfully hold no hopeful delusions that you’ll show up in my messages or emails, or on my doorstep as a result of my airing my inner turmoil. But even though I’m struggling I know what you’d say and through it I find reassurance.

It will be okay and it is going to be fine. 


Doing my best,

Your Canopus

20:04; 06/09/2023; Ankara, Turkey. 

*Aryan and Meena both were RAW agents working in Turkey together for a data collecting mission. Aryan was the mission leader and Meena was an intel provider for him. Aryan and Meena were sitting outside in an open cafe keeping their eyes on the target which was right in front of them. Hotel GreenWorld.*

Aryan: “Well, We're fucked. Really really badly. It's a woman.” *He wears his earpiece and pulls out his morse code device.*

Meena: *She takes a peek at the woman in the red dress going into the restaurant.* “What?? You're sitting in front of one. Half of this planet is woman. Even the abomination called Cold Brew you're drinking is made by a woman. Then why can't a woman be an informer to our enemies?”

Aryan: “Hey…  are you stupid or on your periods?? She's a woman. Our plan was that we know they'll go into the bathroom for the information Exchange. And my plan was to steal the USB from them and leave. Now there's a woman and I can't go into the women's bathroom now.” *He uses his morse device to send a Mission abort request but he was stopped midway by Meena.*

Meena: “Haha…  darling. Don't fucking make that Period joke. That's sexiest and I'm going to cut off your dick again if I hear that. Understood?? Now Don't worry. I'm a woman. And I'll go and steal that drive. So put your coder down and trust in me. You're not the only spy here. I'm too. And I'm a better spy than you.” *Meena now stared at Aryan as she took the coder from his hands.*

Aryan: “Hey… Give me that back. I have to tell the intel department that she's a woman. And, you really think it's that easy?? You just go in there and come out with her stuff?? You're half the size of that woman & and this is your first mission. I'm more experienced and I'll decide.”

Meena: “Ohh.. Now I have to do it. You… you're really a narcissist. You think I can't do that because I'm a woman???
You know this is the problem with you and this department.""

Meena: You guys think women are liabilities you have to keep safe. And that's why your first mission was in Afghanistan and mine is in this dumbfuck land of Turkey. And don't forget we're pretending to be a couple for this mission. So now fucking smile,  I'm going into that restaurant. And I'll come back with that necklace. If I don't consider myself dead and be a male widow.” *Meena left and all Aryan could do was to stare at this form, she was never this angry during his teasing. But now she was in walking death for him.*

*After an hour she comes back. With a USB in her hands she waves at Aryan from a distance. He was getting more worried and gestured to her to come with him before that woman or her companions came to find us. After leaving that place both went to their room and plugged in the USB. And the videos of Drug Trade, Human Trafficking & Weapons Smuggling were clearly identified. Afterwards Aryan announced this to RAW headquarters and gave them all the intel regarding the incident and then the RAW person asked for Meena to talk to.*

RawS: “Hello Ms. Meena.   As we all know, your findings in this investigation by you two has given us many positives . We suspect these Turkish drones are being smuggled to Pakistan and these are kurds being trafficked. Now these concepts are really dangerous. And a woman working in foreign country as a spy on these things is not always a good idea. We are ready to send in the male equivalent of you. But this ultimate decision is in Aryan’s hands. You two can contact us when the decision is made.”

*The Chief hangs the phone. And now Aryan handed Meena a black coffee and came to the bed.*

Aryan: “You're a really good agent, Meena. You really did a lot of good things in this mission. But sorry because I don't think we'll be safe now. So I prefer that a man is standing behind me during a fight. Yet… if you want I'll let you be with me on this mission but the choice is yours.

# TL;DR

I just want to share the story of my absurd marriage. It’s so outrageous that I still have a hard time believing that this actually happened to me. This post is a bit long, but I already condensed it as much as I could. I can probably write a book on this if I wanted to.

My ex-wife and I were married for almost 9 years, but we only lived together for about 1.5 years. She didn’t live with me because she was “studying for PhD” and busy “looking for employment”. In November 2022, she abruptly wanted a divorce, and asked for half of my assets and spousal support. In April 2023, I accidentally found a Chick-fil-A cup in my garage with the name of a man that I never heard of. After several months of investigation, I found out that the man is her boyfriend from when they were in China, and they have been living together whenever the wife was not with me, in multiple cities across the United States.

Almost everything this woman ever told me were lies. In addition, both the woman and the man are incredibly strange and secretive. A lot of what they did is beyond my imagination and comprehension. Who are they? What are they doing in the United States? I got dragged into a legal battle with this person that I hardly knew, and it took a tremendous toll on me mentally, physically, and financially.

# Background

The two of them and I were born in the same city in China, but I never met them when I was in China. I came to the United States with my parents when I was in grade school, and I have lived in California since. I currently work in the tech industry in Silicon Valley.

The woman used to work for a consulting firm in Shanghai. She came to the United States in 2012 to study for PhD in the East Coast. We met online shortly after she came to the US, were in a long-distance relationship for more than a year, and got married in January 2014. Up until the end of 2024, she never had a full time job in the United States.

The man and the woman were high school classmates. He used to work for the Chinese Navy and then a tech company in Shanghai. He came to the United States in 2015 to study for PhD in Virginia. He later worked for a semiconductor company in Silicon Valley.

For the remainder of this post, I will refer to the woman as Paris and the man as Sharik. **Disclaimer, Paris and Sharik are not their real names.**

# The marriage

Before we were married, Paris told me multiple times she planned to drop out of the PhD program after completing the Master’s requirements, and then move to California in summer 2014 and look for a job.

Shortly after we were married, Paris told me she was making very good progress in her PhD, and it would be a shame to drop out. She said she wanted to complete the degree, and she could probably finish in less than 4 years. What she said made sense, and I wanted to be a supportive husband, so I agreed. Around the same time, she also told me she found a summer internship at Baidu in Shanghai, so she can’t spend summer 2014 with me in California.

In summer 2015, Paris again went to “intern” at Baidu in Shanghai. After returning, she confirmed that the upcoming school year will be her final year, and that she will come to California as soon as she graduates.

Summer 2016 came around and Paris had not graduated, but she said she’s almost done. It is very common for PhDs to take more than four years, so I didn’t suspect anything. She told me she didn’t lease an apartment for the upcoming school year because she will be graduating soon, instead she lived in the living room of a friend’s apartment.

From that point forward, she always told me she would graduate in a couple months whenever the topic came up. It’s pretty common for PhDs to be delayed, so I still didn’t suspect anything. During this time, Paris no longer allowed me to visit her on the East Coast, because she’s living in her friend’s living room, so it’s inappropriate and inconvenient for me to stay here.  She did however come visit me in California several times during this period, but some of those trips were also for her USCIS appointments.

In April 2018, Paris finally moved to California. She still hasn’t graduated, but she said her advisor allowed her to work on her dissertation in California. For the remainder of 2018, she went to the East Coast several times to “meet with her advisor”, and was away for 2-3 weeks each time.

In November 2018, Paris said she will go to the East Coast one last time for her defense. I wanted to attend her defense, but she won’t let me because that will put too much pressure on her. After she “graduated” in December, she went vacationing in Miami with “friends”. I was pretty upset about this because I already planned a family vacation during Christmas which had to be canceled.

Paris was busy “job searching” after returning to California. In May 2019, she said she accepted an offer from a company in San Mateo, but she won’t tell me the name of this company. She just said it’s a small company that I probably never heard of.

On 5/20/2019, Paris left home while I was at work, only leaving a note on the dining table saying she went on a road trip. A few days later, she sent me a text saying she was in Portland, Maine. I tried calling her multiple times but no answer. I was very angry. I have been trying to plan a family vacation for the past year, but she’s always busy, yet she had several vacations without me during this time. What am I to her? I seriously contemplated separation.

On 6/1/2019, Paris called me telling me that she’s pregnant. I was ecstatic after hearing this. We have been trying to have a child since the day we were married, and now the child is finally here. Thoughts of separation were completely out the window. Paris said she was in New York at the time, but she’s afraid to fly home due to the pregnancy. She went to Washington D.C. the next day to stay with a “friend"" and saw a doctor. She didn’t return to California until 6/18/2019. After returning home, Paris said she has postponed the start date of her “new job” in order to care for the unborn baby.

On 8/27/2019, Paris told me she actually hasn’t graduated, and her advisor is now telling her to get her act together and go back to the East Coast to finish, or she can forget about her degree. She said her advisor also found her a research assistant job at University C, which is about 50 miles from her school, so she can support herself. I was very angry that she lied to me, but she’s pregnant, and it’s hard to ask her to give up her degree, so I still let her go. Paris left for the East Coast the next day. However, she didn’t live near her school, or near University C, rather she lived next to University D, which is about 10 miles away from University C. Her reason was she’s pregnant, and University D Hospital is the best hospital in the area.

In January 2020, my parents and I all went to the East Coast to welcome the birth of our child. Just one week after our daughter was born, Paris started to push us to go back to California, claiming that she can take care of the child by herself. I stayed on the East Coast till mid February, but my parents insisted on staying longer to take care of their grandchild, and they stayed until 3/5/2020.

On 3/8/2020, just 3 days after my parents returned to California, Paris brought our daughter to my parents’ house in Sacramento, saying that the child was sick and she didn't know what to do. COVID already started at this time, many companies already started WFH, and there were rumors that schools would close soon. We asked Paris to stay in California but she insisted on going back to “complete her degree”. She said she’s almost done and will return to California in April.

I lived in my parents’ house during COVID so I could care for the newborn. We asked Paris multiple times to return to California but she kept on coming up with excuses for not returning, such as not feeling well, not safe to fly during the pandemic, etc.

Paris finally returned to California at the end of September, but she won’t live with us in Sacramento, rather she “lived by herself” in our Bay Area home. She said she really needed to focus on her “job search”, and there were too many distractions in Sacramento. She said she would try to spend a few days every week in Sacramento to help take care of our daughter. In reality, she came to Sacramento about once a month, and only stayed about 2 days each time.

Paris spent the next year “job searching” but couldn’t find anything. By the end of 2021, COVID was getting better and there were rumors of RTO soon. In November, I talked to Paris about moving back to the Bay Area, but she vehemently opposed that idea, saying that I would disturb her “job searching” efforts. My parents talked to her after hearing this, telling her that husband and wife should not be living separately for this long, and Paris was visibly upset after that conversation. About a week later, she told me she needed to go to China, because her father was ill, and her parents were also trying to sell a house under her name and needed her signature. I felt that the timing of this was a bit odd because at the time China had a 28-days quarantine policy, and plane tickets were very expensive and hard to get. But it is hard to say no given her reasons. On 12/18/2021, Paris “left for China”.

Starting in January 2022, I would occasionally go work in the office, so I started living in my Bay Area home for a few days every couple weeks. In February, I started getting a lot of mail from Kaiser Permanente for Paris. I initially thought they were ads because we didn’t even use Kaiser, so I just put them aside. On 3/27/2022, I received a postcard from Kaiser which read something like “Thank you for visiting us”. This looked suspicious, so I opened one of the previous mail pieces and it showed Paris went to Kaiser Fremont on 2/7/2022. She didn’t go to China.

I was thinking what every man would have thought in that situation. I called Paris and made her come home. She swore she was not having an affair. In fact she was “angry” that I would even think she would do something so disgusting. She said she stayed in her parents’ friend’s house, because they went to China and needed someone to watch their home. She offered to show me letters from her parents as proof if I didn’t believe her. I was quite skeptical of what she said, but I had no evidence, and she looked so assertive. I then thought of our daughter, she was sick at the time. I didn’t want her to grow up in a broken family, so I chose to believe what Paris said.

From there, I continued to split my time between Sacramento and the Bay Area, while Paris continued her “job search”. In 2022, many tech companies had layoffs and hiring freezes. It was a tough job market, so I didn’t suspect anything. In July, she got a contractor position through the help of one of my mother’s friends. I initially thought the job was 40 hours/week, but a couple months later I learned that she was only working 10 hours/week. Paris said she was still looking for a full-time job while working part-time.

# The divorce

On 11/28/2022, Paris left home at 9:00am to “work at a Starbucks”, and didn’t come home until around 7:10pm. After coming home, she started arguing with me for no reason and then started throwing things. Then she suddenly screamed: “I want a divorce” and left home at around 7:20pm. I was completely baffled and had no idea what just happened.

I thought she couldn’t be serious about a divorce. We haven't had any disagreements recently. Just a couple days ago we were celebrating Thanksgiving in Sacramento, and were planning to take our daughter to Disneyland for her third birthday. Why would she suddenly want a divorce? Around 11:30pm, she came back with a rental car and started moving her stuff out. At that point I realized she was serious. She still refused to tell me what happened, and she left at around 12:30am.

The next evening, Paris came back to get some of her remaining stuff, and we talked for about an hour. She said she wanted a divorce because I didn’t treat her well. Her examples were I seldom called her and I won’t talk to her after coming home from work. Both allegations were completely false. Even if they were true, how come she never said anything before? Then she said she had been planning for this divorce for several years, and had been consulting divorce lawyers since 2019. That sentence really sent chills down my spine. So she had been plotting against me, and was just pretending all these years. From there, she gave me her proposal of asset division, essentially wanting half of my stuff, and justified her demands by throwing all kinds of legal jargon at me. She was clearly well prepared.

The next few days were the darkest of my life. This was so sudden and so unexpected, it was hard for me to even digest what just happened. I couldn’t eat or sleep, or do anything else but to think about what had just happened. She planned this for years, and she is clearly going after my money. I started looking at what happened around 2019. In December 2018, she got her green card, and I started my current job around the same time. My 4 year work anniversary is coming up soon. Initial RSU spans 4 years, and stock price went up quite a bit during COVID. This means my income will be having a large cliff soon. No wonder she kept asking about my income in the last couple years. This started to make sense now.

For the next few months, Paris constantly threatened and harassed me over the phone and texts, which brought additional trauma to the distress I suffered at the time. She came up with all kinds of false allegations, such as accusing me of abusing our daughter. She even said she already reported me to the police and the CPS, which I later learned were lies. In fact, a social worker from the CPS told me that I don’t need to respond to her messages since we are separated. So I started to ignore her calls and texts, only then did the amount of harassment started to decrease.

At the same time, I started to analyze her behaviors and everything she said. I felt that she is not acting alone, there is someone behind her driving all this. But who is this person? By analyzing my electricity bills, I learned that starting around March 2021, Paris has not been living in my Bay Area home whenever I was not there. This explained why she was so opposed to me moving back to the Bay Area at the end of 2021, and in 2022 often told me to spend more time with our daughter in Sacramento. Where was she? It’s probably the same place she stayed when she “went to China”. By analyzing my phone bills, I also verified Paris indeed started contacting her current lawyer in 2019.

# The paramour

On 4/10/2023, I accidentally found a Chick-fil-A cup while cleaning my garage. The cup had Sharik’s name and phone number printed on it. Who is this person? After several months of investigation, I found that Paris has been living with Sharik since 2016.

Sharik came to the United States in summer 2015 for PhD in Virginia, studying GPU Architectures, and he just graduated in August 2023. However, he only lived in Virginia until 2019 and has lived in multiple states since. Paris has lived with Sharik majority of the time.

1. Paris lived with Sharik in Virginia from March 2016 to April 2018. This was the time that she said she was “close to graduation” and “lived in a friend’s living room”. Truth is, she was not even going to school during those times.
2. Paris lived with me in California from April 2018 to August 2019, but she was often away to “see her advisor” or “vacationing”. I am sure she was with Sharik all those times she was away.
3. Paris lived with Sharik near University D from August 2019 to January 2020. The apartment that my parents and I lived in when we went to the East Coast for our daughter’s birth was actually Sharik’s apartment.
4. In March 2020, after Paris sent our daughter to my parents’ house, she went to Longmont, Colorado to live with Sharik.
5. In late 2020 and early 2021, Paris and Sharik lived together in my Bay Area home.
6. In April 2021, Sharik purchased a condo in Fremont. They lived together in Fremont until Sharik sold the condo in November 2022.
7. After the divorce, Paris and Sharik lived in the same apartment complex in South Bay. After that, they lived together in several other addresses in the Bay Area.
8. In Sharik’s dissertation, submitted August 2023, he thanked his girlfriend Paris for her support and encouragement.

I was not surprised that Paris had been cheating, but I was shocked that the relationship goes back to 2016. Who is this Sharik? Their schools are hundreds of miles apart, how did they know each other? Why did they start cohabiting so quickly? Did they already know each other in China? I started investigating Sharik in China, and they indeed knew each other long before they came to the United States.

Sharik came from a prominent family, his father is a senior officer in the Chinese military. He and Paris were high school classmates in China. He attended one of the best universities in China for bachelor’s, and majored in Electronic Information Science and Technology. Then he went to a naval college for master’s, and studied Mine Detecting Sonar. After graduation, he worked in the Chinese Navy for a couple years, and then he worked for a tech company in Shanghai. So this explained why Paris “interned” in Shanghai in 2014 and 2015, and she never went to Shanghai again after Sharik came to the United States.

# Paris’s version of the story

After Paris knew that I found out about Sharik, she did tone down her demands. I talked to her several times in 2024 to negotiate a settlement, and Sharik obviously came up during the conversations. Her version of the story is below.

1. Paris said she had known Sharik since she was 11.
2. Paris admitted that Sharik was her boyfriend when they were in China, but they broke up in 2010. The reason was Paris was planning to come to the United States, but Sharik couldn’t come because he was in the military.
3. Paris admitted that she didn’t intern for Baidu in 2014 and 2015, rather she worked for her previous employer in Shanghai. She claimed she did not live with Sharik when she was in Shanghai.
4. Paris admitted she had been in contact with Sharik after he came to the United States. In fact, she picked him up from the airport and helped him to settle down.
5. Paris admitted she lived with Sharik in Virginia between 2016 and 2018. She said she no longer had financial aid in 2016, so she didn’t have money to lease an apartment. She feared that I would’ve asked her to move to California if she told me, and she won’t be able to complete her degree. Sharik offered “temporary shelter” so she moved in with him. They lived in the same room, but she claimed that nothing happened between them.
6. Paris denied she was with Sharik whenever she was away from California between April 2018 and August 2019. She said she really did go see her advisor.
7. Paris admitted the apartment she lived near University D in 2019 was Sharik’s apartment. She said she couldn’t lease an apartment because she had no income, so Sharik leased it for her. She said Sharik didn’t live there, he lived in his advisor’s lab during that time.
8. Paris admitted she lived with Sharik in Longmont in 2020. The reason was that she must finish her dissertation in 2020. Had she lived in California then I would’ve asked her to care for our daughter, and she wouldn’t have time to work on her dissertation.
9. Paris denied Sharik lived in my Bay Area home in late 2020 and early 2021.
10. Paris denied that she lived in Sharik’s Fremont home in 2021 and 2022. She said she went to Sharik’s home everyday but still returned to my home every evening. As for why she went to Sharik’s home everyday, she said that’s none of my business.
11. Paris admitted she lived in Sharik’s Fremont home when she “went to China”. She said she wanted to travel with friends, but was afraid that I won’t let her go, that’s why she lied about “going to China”.
12. Paris admitted that Sharik picked her up and took her to his home on 11/28/2022, the night of the divorce.
13. Paris denied that she is still with Sharik after the divorce. She even said she never liked Sharik, and made a bunch of disparaging remarks about him. As for why Sharik claimed that she is his girlfriend in his dissertation, she said she doesn't know and has no control in what Sharik thinks.
14. Paris said she wanted to divorce soon after we were married because she felt that marriage life didn’t suit her. She accused me of ""controlling her life”, and said she had no freedom when she’s with me, but Sharik let her do whatever she wanted. I asked if that’s true then why didn’t she file sooner, and she said she hadn’t graduated and couldn’t support herself, she needed to graduate and find a job before filing for divorce.

I am not going to comment on her story. You be the judge.

# Who are they?

During the investigation, it’s hard to not notice both Sharik and Paris are incredibly strange people, and a lot of what they do defies common sense. They don’t look like typical students or typical adulterers. I really can’t figure out who they are. Some of their abnormal behaviors are:

1. Both individuals took 8 years to complete their PhD, but both left school after just 4 years. I looked up all other PhD students studied under their advisors, about 20 of them, and not one person took more than 5 years to graduate. Why did these two take 8 years? Why did both leave school 4 years before they graduated?
2. Both individuals attended elite universities in China, and have PhD degrees. They are more than capable of making top wages in the United States, and they should know the basic moral principles. Why did they have to go through all these troubles to do something so despicable?
3. They have known each other for more than 20 years, they are way past the honeymoon phase. Why did they have to go out of the way to be together all the time? This seems far too complicated for just doing the deed.
4. Sharik seldom went to school when he was in Virginia. None of his colleagues from school knew anything about him, a few didn’t even know he existed. What was he doing in Virginia? He didn’t talk to his colleagues at all in school?
5. Sharik moved frequently after leaving school in 2019. Other than the Fremont condo that he owned for 1.5 years, he didn’t stay longer than half a year at any of his other addresses. Why is he always moving?
6. Sharik is in close contact with several individuals with special backgrounds, such as individuals that work in the defense industry. How did he know these people?
7. If Paris planned to be with Sharik all along, then why did she have a child with me? This is just cruel. Also Sharik doesn’t mind? 
8. Paris spent the majority of the pregnancy with Sharik near University D. She didn’t have a job at the time, but she was out “working” everyday, even on the day of the delivery. What were they doing next to University D?
9. Our daughter is now 5 years old, but Paris has never cared for her, she seldom even comes to see her. She abandoned the child when she was less than 2 months old just so she can be with Sharik in Colorado. What kind of mother can be this coldhearted?
10. Paris has a PhD in a STEM major, but she couldn’t find a job in Silicon Valley after multiple years of “job search”. The judge has placed a seek work order on her, which she just ignores. Why won’t she work?
11. Paris is always very busy. Prior to the divorce, she was always in her room “working” whenever she’s home, sometimes at 4am in the morning. But she never had a fulltime job. What was she really doing?
12. Paris called her parents almost every day, and often talked for hours. Who talks to their parents that much? Was she really talking to her parents?
13. In 2017 and 2018, Paris went to Stanford University almost every day that she was in California, supposedly to work on her dissertation at the library, and sometimes she wouldn't come home until midnight. Paris didn’t graduate until October 2020, she couldn’t be writing her dissertation in 2017 and 2018. What was she really doing at Stanford?
14. Paris said her previous employer in China still reached out to her from time to time for help on projects, because they couldn’t find anyone else that could do them. What kind of employer would seek help from an ex-employee that left 10 years ago? What exactly can she do that is so indispensable?

In addition, both individuals are extremely secretive, and investigating them was incredibly difficult. Their background reports contain nothing more than their address history. The address history for Paris is not even correct - her report showed that she has been living with me since 2014. But she didn’t live with me! Now I know why she has been using my address everywhere after we were married, and won’t let me mail anything to her. She was trying to hide her whereabouts! Paris also refused to answer the majority of our Discovery questions, and none of the questions pertaining to Sharik. She was sanctioned by the judge for this yet she still refused to answer. Why can’t she answer those questions?

Some more oddities:

1. Paris seldom used my home Wi-Fi. She said she prefers hotspot xfinitywifi, because our home internet was unstable. She also used this as an excuse to often “work at libraries and coffee shops”. It is true that my home internet was unstable, it disconnects for a few hours almost everyday. I had Comcast come over several times and they weren’t able to find anything wrong. Oddly, I have not had any internet issues after Paris left.
2. Paris unplugged all my electronic devices whenever I was not home. She said it was to prevent fire.
3. Paris has alerts set up on search engines, so she knows whenever someone searches for her name online.
4. Paris constantly reminded me to not go through her stuff in her room, even though I never did. She moved all her stuff out the same night that she wanted the divorce. What exactly was in her room that she didn't want me to see?
5. Paris would not tell me where she lives after the divorce. She also warned me multiple times to not investigate her. Exactly what is she afraid of?

I am certain that the two of them are doing something shady. This is way too excessive for just adultery. But what are they doing?

# Lies

I think I am a fairly intelligent person and I am usually pretty good at spotting scams. I am still surprised that I was fooled for this long.

First, I never thought there are people this immoral, especially someone with a PhD degree. I think I was a bit cautious in the first couple years of this marriage, but I really let the guard down after having the child. I never thought there are people that don’t even care about their own children.

Second, Paris is exceptionally good at lying. She doesn’t just make up stories when needed, which is how most people lie, but she brainwashed me by continuously feeding me misinformation, and made me have a completely false perception of her. The contrast was really shocking when she revealed her true self after the divorce. Some examples are: 

1. Paris would tell me from time to time that some male friends were pursuing her, or some strangers tried to hit on her, obviously she turned all of them down. She also told me stories of her previous relationships, and we gossiped about celebrity relationships and those of her friends. She always loathed at those people that were unfaithful, including her close friends. I always thought that she is someone that’s open, honest, and faithful. Well, let’s just say what she did was far worse than people that she despised.
2. Paris always says she was just “borrowing” whenever she asked me for money, and would pay me back as soon as she gets a job. She told me numerous times that she is an independent woman, and does not want me to support her. In fact she is even “ashamed” that she had to rely on me for medical coverage. She often told me that once she gets a job, she would pay a portion of our mortgage and family expenses. She said this as recently as 2 weeks before the divorce. I never really expected her to make too much financial contribution to the family, but I also never thought of her as a greedy person, and certainly didn’t think she would take advantage of me. Boy was I wrong.
3. During our marriage, I had to be very careful whenever I talked to Paris, because she cried – with tears – whenever I said something that might sound slightly critical. I have always thought she is thin-skinned and has strong self-esteem. After I found out about Sharik, I chewed her out in every one of our negotiations, yet she didn't bat an eye and continued to ask for money after I was done. The shamelessness is just astounding.
4. During our marriage, Paris pretended that she knew little about the United States, and she often made silly mistakes or forget things. She also asks some very childish questions, and acts cute. Just two days before the divorce, she was “begging” me to buy her bubble tea. This made me think she is just a simple and naive girl, and lowered my guards. But the fact is, she knows more about the United States than I do, and she has an excellent memory. Not to mention she is extremely calculated and deceptive.
5. Paris is extremely meticulous with her lies. For example, to make me believe she was living with a female friend between 2016 and 2018, she often told me gossip about this “roommate” of hers, such as where she grew up, schools she attended, her boyfriend, her looks and figures, places they hangout, and etc. I never suspected the legitimacy of this “roommate” after hearing all these details. Little did I know she was actually living with Sharik in Virginia during that time. I did some research on this “roommate”, she does exist, and most of what Paris said about her were true, except they were not roommates.

Most importantly, Paris is extremely tough mentally. When she lies, she always speaks with confidence, and doesn’t appear the least bit guilty. Even when her lies were exposed, she still can keep her composure and quickly make up another story to cover up the lie. This was especially obvious during our recent negotiations. I obviously don’t believe anything she says now, but I was fooled many times by her confidence and assertiveness during the marriage.

I do wonder if Paris’s lying skills are her natural abilities, or acquired via some training.

# Conclusion

This lawsuit lasted 2.5 years and it just ended about a month ago. Perhaps I will write another post at some point with more details on the whole process. The end result is I lost about one third of my wealth. That’s just direct loss, indirect loss is impossible to estimate. Most importantly is the psychological trauma I had to go through, and all the years that I wasted on her. My lawyer said this is considered a good outcome under current laws. Perhaps so, but how is this good? How can I not feel angry, frustrated and disheartened?

During this marriage, I have tried my best to be a good and supportive husband. To date, Paris still couldn’t state exactly how I mistreated her. She on the other hand was just exploiting me. Other than giving birth to our daughter, everything else she did was anti-family.

I don’t believe Paris ever intended to have a family with me. She even stated that she has wanted a divorce since 2016, and she started consulting divorce lawyers in 2019, shortly after getting her green card.

Paris was living with another man for the majority of this marriage, and lied to me on virtually everything. The lies I mentioned in this post were just a small fraction of the lies she told. This is a complete violation of the marital contract. Even during the times that she lived with me, she didn't do any housework or cared for the child. She was always busy “writing her dissertation” or “job searching”, which in hindsight were also lies, but I still don’t know what she was really doing. She didn’t fulfill any spousal obligations and had absolutely no contribution to the family.

Despite all these, the so-called California ""family” law worked in Paris’s favor in almost every aspect. In particular this so-called “no fault divorce”, basically doesn't matter what she did during the marriage, she is still entitled to my assets. What kind of logic is this? If everything is “no fault” then what’s the point of having laws? I understand it may be difficult to tell right and wrong in many family disputes, but that clearly isn’t the case here, and what she did couldn’t be more vile. The purpose of laws is to set social standards, protect public rights, and serve justice. Is infidelity, lying, and scamming the kind of values that our elected officials want to promote? The court that handled this case is called the Hall of Justice. Justice is to defend the good and punish the bad. Well, perhaps that’s too much to ask for, but at least don’t punish the good and reward the bad.

I have asked Paris multiple times during our negotiations why she thinks she deserves such a large portion of my assets. She couldn’t provide any good reasons, she just kept stating the law says she is entitled to my assets. Yeah, but this law is just utterly unfair and unreasonable. I suggest the the following changes be made:

1. If one of the spouses cohabitates with a person of the opposite sex without the other spouse’s knowledge, then the times of cohabitation should not count as a part of the marriage.
2. If one of the spouses had major concealments or malicious lies which hurt the interest of the other spouse, then the non-offending spouse should be able to request a shortening of the marriage duration or receive financial compensation.
3. If one of the spouses committed serious fouls during the marriage, then the non-offending spouse should not have to pay spousal support or legal fees to the offending spouse.

There are about a dozen more changes that I would like to see happen to the existing family law, but the three listed above target what I feel are the most egregious and nonsensical.

Part of the reason why I wrote this post is to vent – the past 2.5 years have been extremely difficult and depressing for me. More importantly, I hope what happened to me can get the attention of lawmakers so we can fix these loopholes. Governor Gavin Newsom, Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire, Senate Leader Brian Jones, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, Assembly Leader James Gallagher, and other lawmakers in California and elsewhere, I hope you can see this and do something about it.  I hope no one has to experience what I went through again.

1m2uanp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m2uanp,Financial Red Flags: 5 Signs Your Business is in Trouble (Before It's Too Late),"Hey there, fellow entrepreneur. Let’s have a frank conversation. You pour your heart, soul, and probably more coffee than is medically advisable into your business. You’re the CEO, the head of marketing, the chief bottle-washer, and everything in between. You live and breathe your company, and the thought of it failing is, frankly, terrifying.

But here’s a tough question: How well do you *really* know your business's financial health? It’s easy to get caught up in the passion of your work and operate on gut feelings. You see money coming in, you pay the bills, and you assume everything is okay. The problem is, serious financial trouble doesn't usually announce itself with a marching band and a fireworks display. It starts as a whisper, a tiny crack in the foundation that, if ignored, can bring the whole house down.

See these signs? You might be closer to failure than you think. Ignoring these subtle but critical **financial warning signs** is one of the biggest contributors to **business failure**. The good news is that seeing them early gives you the power to act. This isn't about fear-mongering; it's about empowerment. It's about swapping anxiety for awareness and turning potential pitfalls into a strategic pivot. Let's pull back the curtain on the five most critical financial red flags that signal your business is in trouble, and what you can do about them *right now*.

# Red Flag #1: Your Profit Margins Are Shrinking

This is one of the most deceptive **financial warning signs** because, on the surface, things might look great. Your revenue could be growing, you might be busier than ever, and you feel successful. But if the cost of doing business is growing *faster* than your revenue, you're on a dangerous path. You're working harder for less money, and that's simply not sustainable.

Your profit margin is the percentage of revenue you keep after accounting for all your costs. There are two main types to watch:

* **Gross Profit Margin:** This shows what you make after subtracting the direct costs of producing and selling your goods or services (Cost of Goods Sold or COGS).
* **Net Profit Margin:** This is the ""bottom line."" It’s what’s left after *all* expenses are paid, including rent, salaries, marketing, and taxes.

**Example in the Wild:**

Imagine you own a trendy coffee shop. Last year, you sold a latte for $4.00. The coffee, milk, and cup (your COGS) cost you $1.00, giving you a gross profit of $3.00 and a 75% gross margin. This year, you’re selling more lattes than ever, but the price of coffee beans has shot up. Your COGS for that same $4.00 latte is now $1.75. Your gross profit has shrunk to $2.25, and your margin has dropped to 56%. Even though you're selling more, you're making significantly less on each sale. If your rent and payroll have also increased, your net margin is getting squeezed even tighter.

**How to Spot and Fix It:**

* **Calculate and Track Relentlessly:** Don't guess. Calculate your gross and net profit margins every single month. Put it on your calendar. Use accounting software like QuickBooks or Xero to automate this. The trend is what matters. A one-month dip might be a fluke; a six-month slide is a siren.
* **Analyze Your COGS:** Where are your direct costs creeping up? Can you find a new supplier for your coffee beans? Can you negotiate a better price by buying in larger quantities? Every dollar saved on COGS goes directly to your gross profit.
* **Review Your Pricing Strategy:** Many business owners are terrified to raise prices. They fear losing customers. But if your costs have permanently increased, your prices must reflect that new reality. A small, well-communicated price increase is often far less damaging than slowly going broke.
* **Optimize Your Overhead:** Look at your net margin. Are there subscriptions you're not using? Is your marketing spend delivering a positive return on investment (ROI)? Cut the fat, but be careful not to cut muscle. Don't slash the marketing that's actually bringing in customers.

# Red Flag #2: You're Drowning in Debt

Debt isn't inherently evil. Smart business owners often use loans or credit to fuel growth, purchase essential equipment, or manage temporary **cash flow problems**. But there's a world of difference between strategic debt and desperate debt. When you start ""robbing Peter to pay Paul""—using one line of credit to make the minimum payment on another—you're no longer in control. The debt is controlling you.

This is a major indicator of **business risk**. High debt levels mean a huge portion of your income is immediately eaten up by interest payments, leaving you with very little to reinvest in the business, pay yourself, or build a safety net.

**Example in the Wild:**

A freelance graphic designer starts her business with a new computer financed on a credit card. That’s manageable. Then, a client pays late, so she uses the credit card to cover her rent. She decides to attend a big conference to find new clients and puts the flight and hotel on the card, too. Soon, she's maxed out. She takes out a small business loan not to invest in new software, but just to make the crushing credit card payments. Her monthly income is now almost entirely dedicated to servicing debt, and she has zero flexibility to handle a slow month or an unexpected expense.

**How to Spot and Fix It:**

* **Know Your Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** This sounds complicated, but it's simple. It’s your total liabilities (what you owe) divided by your total equity (what you own). A high ratio means you're heavily reliant on creditors. Track this quarterly.
* **Stop Using Debt for Operating Expenses:** This is a cardinal sin. If you need to use a credit card to pay for rent, utilities, or payroll, it's a massive red flag that your core business model is not generating enough cash.
* **Create a Debt Repayment Plan:** List all your debts from the highest interest rate to the lowest. This is the ""avalanche"" method. Throw every spare dollar at the debt with the highest interest rate while making minimum payments on the others. Once it's paid off, roll that entire payment amount onto the next-highest-rate debt. The psychological win and financial momentum are powerful.
* **Negotiate with Creditors:** If you're truly struggling, don't hide. Call your creditors. Explain the situation and ask if they can offer a temporary reduction in interest rates or a modified payment plan. It's not a guarantee, but it's always worth asking.

# Red Flag #3: Inconsistent and Unpredictable Cash Flow

Cash flow is the lifeblood of your business. It's the rhythm of money moving in and out of your company. Profit is a long-term measure of success, but cash is what keeps the lights on *today*. You can have a profitable business on paper and still face **business failure** because you don't have enough cash in the bank to pay your employees this Friday. This is the definition of **cash flow problems**.

Inconsistent cash flow feels like a frantic cycle of feast and famine. One month you feel rich, the next you're scraping by. This volatility makes it impossible to plan, invest, or grow.

**Example in the Wild:**

A construction contractor wins a huge project. It's a ""profitable"" job that will take three months to complete. The problem? He has to buy all the materials and pay his crew weekly, but the client's contract states they will pay him in one lump sum 30 days *after* the project is complete. For four months, he has massive amounts of cash flowing *out* and nothing flowing *in*. He has to take out a high-interest loan just to survive, which eats away the entire profit from the job he was so excited about.

**How to Spot and Fix It:**

* **Create a Cash Flow Forecast:** This is non-negotiable. It’s a simple spreadsheet that projects your cash inflows (sales, invoice payments) and outflows (rent, payroll, supplies) over the next 3, 6, or 12 months. This is your crystal ball. It allows you to see future shortfalls and plan for them *before* they happen.
* **Shorten Your Invoicing Cycle:** Are you waiting until the end of the month to send invoices? Stop. Invoice immediately upon completion of the work. The sooner you send the invoice, the sooner you get paid.
* **Incentivize Early Payments:** Offer a small discount (e.g., 2% off) for clients who pay their invoices within 10 days. The small hit to your profit is often well worth the benefit of having cash in hand sooner.
* **Require Deposits or Milestone Payments:** For large projects, never finance the entire job for your client. Require a deposit upfront (e.g., 30-50%) and set up milestone payments throughout the project. This ensures your cash flow stays aligned with your expenses.
* **Build a Cash Reserve:** Aim to have at least 3-6 months' worth of essential operating expenses saved in a separate business savings account. This is your emergency fund. It’s what turns a catastrophe into a manageable inconvenience.

# Red Flag #4: Your Sales are Declining (or Stagnant)

A steady decline in sales is the most obvious **financial warning sign**, but it's amazing how many business owners explain it away. ""It's just a slow season."" ""The economy is bad."" ""It's a temporary blip."" While sometimes true, a consistent downward trend is a sign that something is fundamentally wrong.

Your market might be changing, a new competitor might be eating your lunch, your marketing might be stale, or your product might no longer be meeting customer needs. Stagnant sales are just as dangerous. A business that isn't growing is, in reality, shrinking relative to inflation and market growth.

**Example in the Wild:**

A beloved local bookstore has been a community staple for 20 years. But over the last two years, sales have slowly but consistently ticked downward. The owner blames Amazon, but the reality is more nuanced. A new, modern bookstore opened across town with a coffee shop, author events, and a strong social media presence. The old bookstore's marketing is non-existent, their website is outdated, and they haven't changed their inventory in years. Their loyal customers are aging, and they're not attracting a new generation of readers.

**How to Spot and Fix It:**

* **Talk to Your Customers (and Lost Customers):** Why are they buying less? Why did they leave? Was it price? Service? A better offer elsewhere? A simple survey or a few honest phone calls can provide invaluable, and sometimes painful, insights.
* **Analyze Your Competition:** Do a deep dive into what your successful competitors are doing. What are their prices? What is their marketing message? How are they using social media? What can you learn and adapt?
* **Innovate Your Offerings:** The market is not static. Customer needs evolve. Do you need to update your service? Add a new feature to your product? Bundle services in a new way? Don't let your business become a relic.
* **Re-evaluate Your Marketing:** Is your message still resonating? Are you advertising on the right channels to reach your ideal customer? If you've been doing the same thing for years, it's time for a refresh. What worked in 2020 may not work today.

# Red Flag #5: You're Ignoring Your Financial Statements

This is the red flag that enables all the others. Your financial statements—the Income Statement (P&L), the Balance Sheet, and the Cash Flow Statement—are the instrument panel of your business. Flying a plane without looking at the instruments is reckless, and so is running a business without understanding your financials.

Many owners find this part of the business boring, intimidating, or confusing, so they avoid it. They hand a shoebox of receipts to their accountant once a year and hope for the best. This is a recipe for disaster. You don't need to be a CPA, but you absolutely must understand the story your numbers are telling you.

**Example in the Wild:**

A restaurant owner is passionate about food but hates numbers. His accountant prepares monthly reports, but they go into a drawer, unread. He feels like the restaurant is busy, but he doesn't realize his food costs have skyrocketed (shrinking margins), he's taken on too much debt to renovate (high debt), and his accounts payable are stretching to 90 days (cash flow problems). One day, his primary food supplier cuts him off for non-payment, and the entire operation grinds to a halt. The **financial warning signs** were all there, sitting in that drawer, for months.

**How to Spot and Fix It:**

* **Schedule a Monthly ""Money Date"":** Set aside 1-2 hours every single month to sit down with your financial statements. No distractions.
* **Learn the Basics:** Ask your accountant or bookkeeper to walk you through your reports. Ask them, ""What are the three most important numbers on this page I should be looking at? What do they mean? What should I be worried about?"" Don't be afraid to say, ""Explain that to me like I'm five.""
* **Focus on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** You don't need to track 100 different metrics. Identify the 5-7 most important numbers for your specific business. For the coffee shop, it might be average customer ticket, profit margin per latte, and daily sales. For the contractor, it might be project profitability and accounts receivable aging.
* **Use the Data to Make Decisions:** The point of looking at your numbers isn't just to know them; it's to *use* them. Your financials should inform every major decision you make, from hiring a new employee to launching a new product to raising your prices.

# The Bottom Line: From Fear to Action

Seeing one of these red flags doesn't mean your business is doomed. It means it's time to pay attention. It's a call to action. The most successful entrepreneurs aren't the ones who never face problems; they're the ones who see them coming and act decisively.

Stop running your business on hope and gut feelings alone. Embrace your numbers. Make them your ally. By regularly monitoring your margins, managing your debt, forecasting your cash flow, analyzing your sales, and reading your financial statements, you transform from a reactive victim of circumstance into a proactive, strategic CEO. You can spot the **financial warning signs** early, mitigate your **business risk**, and steer your company away from the rocks of **business failure** and toward the open waters of sustainable success. Now, go open up that financial report. Your future self will thank you.",1,1752817627.0,GrowCashflow,0,1.0,False

To make things right with his secretary, Jerome Pickett asked for a divorce.

I told him he could leave with nothing, but he refused.

In the end, we made a bet—a year-long one.

A year later, he broke down and screamed, ""You didn't stick to the agreement!""

I smiled at him and replied calmly, ""But wasn't it you who broke the agreement?""

Someone went through forty years without learning love and responsibility.

However, they would eventually pay the price for their greed and hypocrisy.

\*\*\*\*\*

After forty years together and twenty years of marriage, my husband Jerome cheated on me.

He finally came home after giving me the silent treatment for one month.

He sat across the coffee table, staring at me indifferently.

""Raquel, I assume you've had enough time to calm down,"" he said.

He went on, ""Raquel, we're both in our forties, old enough to think about this rationally.

""Now that you've found out, I have nothing left to hide.

""Winnie and I have been together for a year now. During this time, I've kept it hidden to spare your feelings.

""I know what we did was wrong. That's why this past year has been torture for me. I've been carrying this burden of guilt.

""I don't want to go on like this. I've already betrayed you and our son. I can't do the same to Winnie.

""So let's get a divorce.

""I'll transfer all cash and real estate to you and our son and only keep my company shares.

""After all these years together, let's end this without any drama.""

I thought he had come back to explain himself to me.

I thought he had come back to save our marriage.

I thought he had come back to beg for my forgiveness.

But never in my wildest dreams did I think he'd come back just to divorce me.

Twisting the silver wedding band I'd worn for over twenty years, I noticed its once-bright luster had long since faded.

Instead, it bore numerous scratches that told the story of time's passage.

I took off my wedding ring and flung it at Jerome. ""Take back what's yours.""

Jerome caught the object Raquel threw at him without realizing what it was. Only when it landed in his palm and he glanced down did he recognize it.

To his surprise, it was that worn-out silver ring.

He remembered this ring. It was the very one he'd given Raquel when he proposed to her.

Jerome didn't expect that she still kept it.

Somehow, a pang of guilt welled up in Jerome.

But at the thought of Winnie, that pang of guilt quickly faded.

""After all the beautiful diamond rings I've bought you, why would you still keep this worthless piece of junk?"" he asked.

Jerome casually tossed the ring into the trash bin near the coffee table.

He thought this worthless junk should never have existed in his home.

That wretched ring was a constant reminder of how destitute he used to be.

It also reminded him of how wretched he was back then.

I watched as Jerome tossed the wedding ring I had worn for over two decades straight into the trash.

I laughed at my devotion and stupidity. It was so foolish for me to still have hope in him after all this time.

I wonder why I was still clinging so desperately to these memories.

That worthless silver ring had shackled me for twenty long years.

Now that it was gone, I suppose it was finally time for me to let go.

The teenager who said he would love me and accompany me for the rest of my life gradually faded from my memory.

People really did change, didn't they?

So what if we were childhood sweethearts? What did twenty years of marriage even matter?

Nothing could ever compare to his precious darling.

This sudden epiphany almost felt like a blessing. I was only forty-two, still in the prime of my life.

At least I saw his true colors in time, and I still have the capital to cut my losses and start over.

But for no apparent reason, an inexplicable fury surged through me.

The divorce was happening, but I would be the one setting the terms.

Throughout all these years as a wealthy wife, I have maintained elegant manners.

However, turning the other cheek had never been my style.

I said, ""Jerome, I stood by you from scratch and endured every hardship imaginable with you, and together, we built this family fortune.

""And now you want to take the fortune we sweated blood to build and use it to marry some other woman?

""Let me make this crystal clear. I won't let any other woman reap the fruits of my life's work.

""Anyone who dares to take what's mine, I'll make sure she pays dearly for it.

""If you want to run off with your darling, then leave with nothing!""

Jerome sighed wearily, as if he'd expected this from me.

He said, ""Raquel, I'm sorry I cheated on you, and I understand you're angry.

""But I really don't love you anymore.

""Winnie is still young. There's no way I can just leave her with nothing.

""We've known each other for forty years and been married for twenty. We shared so many wonderful moments together.

""After all these years together, just grant me this wish.

""Let's part ways amicably.

""Please don't say such hurtful things anymore. It's damaging our bond. Even if we get divorced, I'll always consider you family.""

He claimed he didn't love me anymore, insisted on leaving assets for Winnie, kept reminiscing about how happy we used to be, and expected us to part amicably without any hard feelings.

He actually said that even after the divorce, I'd still be his family.

How touching, as if that made any difference.

Those once-familiar eyes now filled me with nothing but disgust.

I scoffed, ""Jerome, you've got some nerve. One is a young, pampered new lover, and the other is your wife, who's been through thick and thin with you for decades. Do you really think we can all just play happy family?

""You must be joking. That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.""

I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh.

I must be the only one who could still laugh after being betrayed.

I laughed so hard under his awkward gaze before finally stopping.

Then I wiped the tears of bitter laughter from my eyes.

I snapped, ""You want a divorce? Fine. But you're walking out with nothing. Or forget it.""

I remained adamant, completely unmoved by his pathetic attempts at playing the victim.

Jerome agitatedly twirled the coffee cup in his hand before speaking up coldly.

He said, ""Raquel, I've always believed that we can still be family and friends even if we can't be husband and wife.

""We grew up together with forty years of shared history. Do you have to be this ruthless?""

Ruthless? I didn't think so. I spent twenty years standing by him through every hardship to help him build his business from scratch.

After all those years of hard work, I'd finally made it, and I was supposed to be enjoying a good life.

Now he was ready to run off and start a new life with that woman.

Why should I let some other woman just waltz in and enjoy the good life we built together without lifting a finger?

I was miserable, so why should he get to live happily ever after?

# Chapter 2

I stayed silent, and that was my answer.

Jerome suddenly slammed the coffee cup down onto the coffee table.

With a sharp crack, the coffee cup shattered into fragments upon impact.

It was just like our marriage now, broken beyond repair.

Jerome said angrily, ""Raquel, after all these years together, I never would have thought you could be this greedy.

""Half of our marital assets are legally mine, and I've already given you the lion's share. How can you still be so insatiable?

""Can't we just part ways amicably? Do you have to force us to turn against each other?""

I curled my lips into a mocking smile at his furious expression.

It was his betrayal that left me miserable and resentful, not the other way around.

My kindness was exploited, my trust trifled with, my affections betrayed, and my sincere heart ridiculed.

After all this, how dare he still expect a clean break?

""My decision is final,"" I said coldly. ""If you want a divorce, you leave with nothing. Otherwise, you won't like what comes next.""

After all his years as CEO, Jerome had rarely stooped to this level when speaking to anyone.

Raquel's relentless provocations finally pushed Jerome to his breaking point.

He said, ""Raquel, my guilt has its limits.

""Yes, I know you've endured every hardship with me. But half of our marital assets rightfully belong to me. There's no way I'll let you have it all.

""If we can't reach an agreement, we'll settle this in court. You should know you might end up with far less than this offer.

""I still hope you'll reconsider this carefully.""

I poured myself a cup of coffee and took a sip. It was bitter, much like the reality I'm facing right now.

I looked up at him and said, ""Oh? So now our decades of shared history don't matter anymore?""

Then I sneered.

I continued, ""Jerome, go ask a lawyer. If I don't agree, do you think the court would grant the divorce without my consent?

""If this divorce lawsuit drags on for decades, we'll both be dead and buried.

""So your precious little darling will just wail. She'll always be the mistress, even to her grave.""

Jerome was fuming. Why couldn't I get through to her? If she insisted on being this stubborn, she would have no one to blame but herself for what happened next.

He said, ""If you don't agree, fine. I'm moving out today. I'll file for divorce in two years, and I can still get a divorce by then.

""I can also make her my lawful wife. And you? Forget about getting anywhere near that much of the assets.""

With that, he grabbed his suitcase and headed to the bedroom.

Ten minutes later, he emerged, dragging a heavy suitcase.

Without even glancing at me, he strode straight for the door.

After betraying me, he still thought he could control me? Fine, let's see who could win at last.

I said slowly, ""It seems an inclusive society now. Who knows? Maybe even more people would actually support her being the other woman?""

At that, Jerome froze in the doorway. He whirled around, glaring at me with burning intensity. ""What the hell are you trying to pull?""

I took another slow sip of my coffee. It was bitter at first but with a lingering sweetness.

""What can I do? Netizens these days are so tolerant. They might even start shipping you two, rooting for your little star-crossed romance—""

Before I could finish my sentence, I heard Jerome roar furiously, ""Don't you dare!""

His fingers turned white from gripping the suitcase, and veins throbbed visibly at his temples.

All his previous composure vanished, replaced by visible panic.

I never expected him to be this protective of another woman.

Seeing him like that, I couldn't help but laugh mockingly.

In negotiations, nothing was more dangerous than letting the other party exploit weaknesses.

I said, ""I dare. You know damn well there's nothing I wouldn't do.""

I was elegant, generous, modest, and sensible.

But I sought revenge for the smallest grievance. Jerome knew that better than anyone.

Back in the early days of building our business, Jerome and I were constantly out dining with clients.

Being young and attractive, I inevitably faced unwanted advances at those business dinners.

I'd always just cling to Jerome and endure it in silence.

But once Jerome and I became successful, those who had once harassed me faced various consequences. Some had their families broken up. Others were engulfed in scandals, and a few even went bankrupt.

Jerome knew it was my doing, and he even helped me cover my tracks.

So he knew I was not bluffing.

I supposed this explained why he was stooping to negotiate the divorce terms himself.

I thought he was afraid that I would deal with him and his precious darling just as ruthlessly as I did with those others.

But in doing so, I found his Achilles' heel.

Jerome remained silent and stared at me with cold eyes.

Unfazed, I stared back at him defiantly.

I said, ""If you insist on taking the shares, the company could go under. You know I can make that happen.

""Not only that, I'll sue you and your precious darling to reclaim every cent of our marital assets.

""Besides, I might even file a bigamy lawsuit against you. Who knows? I might just win—""

Before I could finish, Jerome stormed over, glaring at me from across the coffee table. His eyes were blazing with fury.

I ignored him, sipping my coffee leisurely. It even tasted better and better.

Jerome knew all too well that Raquel really had the means to pull it off, and that was exactly why he didn't dare make a move against her.

Defeated, he relented and softened his tone.

He said, ""Raquel, we grew up together as childhood sweethearts. There's a bond between us that goes all the way back.

""We've known each other for forty years. Tell me honestly. Haven't I always treated you well?

""Even though I don't love you now, I still consider you family. Can't you just grant me this?

""That's the company we built together through blood, sweat, and tears. How could you even think of destroying it?""

He might have sounded sincere, but honestly, I just found it laughable.

Just to divorce me and legitimize his precious mistress, Jerome has tried every dirty trick in the book.

I said, ""Jerome, stop lying to yourself. What bond could possibly remain between us now?""

""Of course, I would destroy it. You know I never let a grudge go unavenged. I won't let a single cent go to those who've harmed me.""

Jerome was shaking violently. His fury was clearly at its peak. ""Raquel, I never thought you'd turn out to be such a crazy woman!""

He stormed out, slamming the door behind him, and this time, he was gone for another whole month.

# Chapter 3

For that entire month, I did just one thing. I hired a lawyer to sue him and his precious darling.

No one could betray me and get away with it.

Then he came crawling back.

What true love indeed.

Jerome exclaimed, ""Raquel, you actually sued me and Winnie!""

Seeing the fury on his face gave me a deep sense of satisfaction.

I said, ""So, all your assets got frozen?

""You've received the court summons, have you? Then you'd better tell your precious little darling to get her finances in order. Otherwise, if she can't cough up the money when the time comes, she'll end up on the defaulters' list.

""Also, since we're still married, I'd advise you to stop giving her any more money. Lately, I've received quite a few anonymous tips with photographic evidence. It's more than enough to build a solid bigamy case against you.

""Don't worry. Given our decades-long history, I'm not planning to do that for now.

""But I have no connection with Winnie. I'll sue her at any moment to reclaim every penny of our marital assets.

""What's more, stop all your underhanded dealings at the company.

""I'll let it slide this month. But if I catch you pulling any more tricks, I won't hesitate to call a board meeting and expose your true colors. The board will surely consider replacing the CEO.""

Jerome shuddered, a sudden wave of dread washing over him.

He realized that Raquel had been tracking his every move.

Lately, he had had this creeping feeling of being watched. Now it hit him that Raquel must have people tailing him.

He had been living under her close surveillance all this time.

After decades together, he knew Raquel's methods all too well. She had personally settled scores with every single person who'd ever crossed her.

Back then, he took pride in having such a formidable wife. Now, all he felt was sheer terror.

The reason he offered Raquel the lion's share of their assets in the divorce was not without cause.

He knew all too well how ruthless she could be, and he was terrified she'd go nuclear.

He'd envisioned a clean break with her.

But his negotiations broke down completely.

He knew he owed Raquel.

He had truly loved her once.

But after all these decades, his feelings for her were gone.

He knew just how formidable Raquel could be. At first, divorce wasn't even on his mind. He only wanted to keep Winnie outside the marriage.

He never expected to get caught.

He remembered that day when Winnie was slapped by Raquel and didn't dare fight back.

At that moment, a wave of guilt washed over him for Winnie.

He wanted to give her a proper status.

He didn't want Winnie to be the other woman anymore.

He didn't want her to be slapped again.

He made the decision to divorce after careful consideration.

He was certain that even if they got divorced, Raquel wouldn't just cast aside decades of affection, as they had grown up together.

But he was mistaken. Raquel didn't even show a trace of sentiment.

Given her vengeful nature, he should have known that Raquel would never let him off easily.

He pictured Raquel making a scene.

He imagined his own social ruin.

He thought of his son.

He remembered his aging parents.

A deep sense of helplessness settled over him.

He didn't understand why it was so hard to be with the one he loved.

He let out a long breath and finally made up his mind.

As long as Raquel stopped making trouble and let him and Winnie live in peace, he'd accept it.

After all, even without his shares, he was still the CEO with a salary high enough for him and Winnie to live on.

He said, ""Raquel, I've told you that you're family to me. So I'll give you what you want. If you drop the lawsuit, I'll walk away with nothing but the clothes on my back.""

Seeing him so defeated and compromised, I felt utterly lost inside.

Suddenly, I remembered the young Jerome who shielded me during the car accident.

Back then, he was covered in blood. His trembling hand cupped my face. His voice was broken and shaky.

He said, ""Raquel, it doesn't hurt. Don't... cry. It breaks my heart to see you cry.

""Don't worry. I won't... die. If you don't believe me... let's make a bet.""

He coughed up a mouthful of blood. It was shockingly red.

He said, ""I bet I won't die.

""If I live, you marry me. If I die, you walk away.""

The face from my memory slowly overlapped with Jerome standing before me now.

""Raquel, for the sake of all the years we grew up together, can't you just let this go?"" Jerome pleaded.

His voice snapped me back. I looked at him, feeling upset.

""Jerome, let's make a bet,"" I said quietly.

Jerome froze, clearly not expecting Raquel to bring up a bet at a time like this.

It brought back memories of all those times he spent with Raquel.

He felt like changing his mind, but when he thought of Winnie, he quickly suppressed it.

""How do you want to bet?"" I asked.

I looked at him seriously, and he met my gaze, just as earnest as me.

It was just like the way we used to bet.

""I bet she doesn't really love you. She's only after your money,"" I declared.

As soon as I finished, Jerome's face darkened.

After a beat, he responded, ""She's not like that.""

I could tell he was annoyed, as if I had slandered their perfect love, but I still pressed on.

""I bet when you're broke, she'll dump you and go find herself a new rich guy,"" I said.

Jerome snapped, ""Impossible!""

""I'll bet you on this unless you're too chicken to take the wager,"" I urged.

Jerome retorted, ""Why wouldn't I? Winnie isn't such a shallow woman.""

I said, ""Fine, let's make this bet. First, I reclaim all our marital assets, and you leave with nothing, not even a single share of the company.

""If your sweetheart sticks with you through thick and thin for a whole year at your lowest, you win the bet.

""Then I'll return all your company shares and split the rest of our marital assets fifty-fifty.

""At that point, you can give everything to your precious darling. I won't object in the slightest.

""And I'll even persuade our son to accept Winnie and give you both his blessings.

""I'll also talk to your parents and make sure they won't get angry with you.""

Jerome stared at Raquel in shock. His mind was in turmoil.

Her aggressive attitude just now reminded him exactly of the times she used to challenge him to bet in the past.

He clearly had no intention of taking the bet, yet at that very moment, as if possessed, he found himself nodding.

He said, ""Alright, you're on.""

Seeing him agree so decisively, I was momentarily dazed.

Countless images overlapped in my mind.

As a boy, as a teenager, and as a man after college, he was always so unwavering.

I said, ""Don't you even want to know what's at stake if you lose?""

""I won't lose!"" Jerome said with conviction, completely confident in his own judgment.

He declared, ""If I lose, I'll accept whatever terms you set.

""But we absolutely have to sign a separate agreement.""

Confident of victory, he still wanted something in writing to prevent Raquel from going back on her word.

I shook my head. ""Jerome, we've been making bets for decades. When have we ever needed a written contract?""

Jerome said irritably, ""How do I know you won't go back on your word?""

I looked at him calmly.

I said, ""Jerome, you begged me for this divorce.

""I'm only making this bet because of all we've been through these years. Take it or leave it. It makes no difference to me.

""You know I always honor my bets. When have I ever reneged?""

1m2ua25,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowDoIStopSnoring/comments/1m2ua25/when_your_partner_snores_like_a_power_tool_and/,When your partner snores like a power tool and you finally fight back with science,"Let’s get something straight.

I love my partner. I really do. They’re sweet, thoughtful, and make a killer omelet. But when they fall asleep, it’s like someone turned on a rusty chainsaw inside their face.

I used to think snoring was just an “old man” thing. Something sitcoms exaggerated for laughs. Cute, even. Ha. Nope. Not cute. Not when you’ve spent two years sleeping on the living room floor like a sad raccoon just to escape the audio nightmare.

So yeah, I reached my breaking point. And I gave them an ultimatum: Fix your snoring or I’m getting a second bedroom and a white noise machine that can drown out a freight train.

**The “snorepocalypse” begins**

It started slow. First, the occasional piglet snort. Then, a full-blown hog farm symphony. I tried earplugs. I tried pushing them onto their side like a passive-aggressive judo move. I even looked into sleeping in a hammock in the yard.

Desperate times.

And THEN they stumbled on something called a **SleepZee anti snoring mouthpiece**. They said they saw a bunch of **sleepzee reviews** and wanted to try it. I thought it was going to be one more overpriced piece of plastic I’d find under the bed in three days.

But surprisingly, they stuck with it.

Here’s what they bought:  
[**SleepZee mouthpiece link**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2KTJXHHK/?uid=36928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowDoIStopSnoringEmmaLewis)

**Spoiler: it actually worked. I was shook.**

I didn’t notice it right away because I had conditioned myself to expect the nightly “snore-quake.” But about a week in, I realized I wasn’t waking up in survival mode anymore.

My jaw wasn’t clenched. My pillow wasn’t drenched in tears of frustration. And I hadn’t googled “how to safely muffle your partner without going to jail” in several days.

Turns out this little **no snoring mouthpiece** is molded to fit their mouth and slightly moves the jaw forward, keeping the airway open. No gadgets. No surgery. Just one odd-looking thing that somehow made our bedroom livable again.

**Benefits I didn’t expect as the snore victim**

* I now sleep. Like actually sleep. REM and everything.
* My coffee addiction has halved. My sanity is up 200%.
* I don’t startle awake thinking someone’s breaking into the house.
* We actually fall asleep holding hands instead of me plotting escape routes.

**Here’s the specific one we used** (in case you need backup before you smother your snoring love):  
[**Check it out here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2KTJXHHK/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowDoIStopSnoringEmmaLewis)

**If you’re living with a snorer, I see you**

I used to feel guilty for being so cranky about it. Like, it’s not their fault, right? But after reading a few **sleepzee mouthpiece reviews**, I realized how common this is. Snoring doesn’t just mess with the person doing it - it slowly breaks the will of whoever shares their bed.

And if you’re someone who has to politely say “you were snoring again” every morning while holding back silent rage, please know you’re not alone.

Also: push for solutions. You don’t have to suffer like this forever.

**Side notes for curious partners like me**

* They said the first few nights were weird, but not painful
* After boiling it to mold, it stayed put without falling out
* Cleaning is easy and fast
* It doesn’t make them look like a hockey goalie

**Final word from someone who earned their peace**

Sleep is sacred. If your life partner’s snoring sounds like they swallowed a lawnmower, don’t accept it as fate. There are options. Some might even be quiet, comfy, and shockingly effective.

I never thought I’d be one of those people leaving reviews on mouthpieces. But here I am. Because now I sleep. And you deserve to, too.

 Somehow I find peace in the fact that I know at some point even if only for a minute you are out there looking up at the same night sky. Is it while you take a smoke break at work? Surfing through your phone. Looking at my pages. Maybe even reading these words in real time. 

Did you know sound once uttered is a wave that never stops? It just travels untill it's sound can't be heard but it still travels all the same. So every word I speak to you when I find a quiet place no one will hear somehow reaches you I'm sure. That is the power of intention. That is how blessings and curses work. The feelings attached to them when uttered can be creative or destructive. The can love and heal or they can harm or destroy. I feel the difference now. The mania is gone. The severe dibilitating depression is now just a dull ache. There is more hope and more reason to believe in myself. More reason to believe in you and more reason to believe in us. 

Google told me I had requested and archive download of my data. I didn't request this so I know someone else did. I can only assume it's you. Someone I feel happy about that. That I am on your mind and your curious what I'm up to. I know you will see the search terms. Looking for you in unusual places. Surfing through thousands and thousands of images. Screenshots to many of ones that could be you. Even more of writings that I have thought could be you to. I have to go back through them and delete the ones that just don't ring true. I know the vast majority are not you. If any are it would be a small percentage. Although I do have hopes for a few. The jynx profile is cute and revealing. It's both bitter and living at the same time. Oh and the idea of the tattoo I should get to prove to you my love. I agree to that only if I but the the things needed and you do the tattoo. I have a couple others I want to add to that. I even look for you on dating sites and that why I never pay money to messege back. Got this strange messeg that said, ""I think Id like having you next to me since you already meant something to me in my life"". Only the picture was not you. Kind of got my hopes up, but I won't message just so I don't the loose the hope of it. 

Remember the sigil you showed me. The one that was your name. How I have tried and tried to recreate that from my memory but I just can't. I use to have a copy of it. But someone burnt all my stuff. Anyway I want to get the tattoo. Only I want to place it within a invocation triangle. Something I can touch with my hand and speak to you like an intercom. Stupid I know but I love the idea. Also I want to get the Forever and Always that we use to say. Id let you do them. I know you do it well . Perfectionist that you are. Though they don't need to be done well. Just done by your hand. That is what matters. 

I buy Slim Jim's just cause you liked them. I've even peeled the skin off just cause I watched you do it one time. I buy Gain original scent even though I like others just because the smell reminds me of you. Just like the mixture of coffee and coco butter that you use to use as body wash. I can't tell you how many times I've said out loud when I think I find you online. ""Hey Pollyanna, wanna come out and play"". The stupid song you found as a young girl and sang before you knew what the words were about. ""Telephone man"". I ve played it to many times. It never ceases to put a smile on my face. I remember you imitating the voice and acting out the song for me. As you told me it's meaning and how you figured it out too. Jesus Christ on a cracker how dam adorably cute you were. 

I made corned beef the other day and I had this sudden craving for corned beef hash just because of you. I've even made that little mixture of outmeal peanut butter and coco powder as a snack. That stuff is like concrete. Lol. I even bought a Italian classic sub made just the way you like it with a pound of mayo at the end. 

How many times since I left have you watched Rory on Gilmore Girls? Willy Wonka, Wizard of Oz, Houseboat, Pollyanna? Those movies you watch when your sad or don't feel well. Let's not forget Gummi Bears , Care Bears, Scooby Doo, Ewoks. I remember when you flipped out because Supernatural was on Scooby Doo, and really flipped out because Scooby Doo was on Supernatural. I remember you wouldn't watch the final 3 episode for 2 yrs and then when we did you cried like you had lost your own child. To be honest I did too. Dammit Dean driving his Impala in heaven waiting for Sam to arrive. I really remember making you watch The Notebook. On my god, how I remember. I fell asleep with my head in your lap. With you playing with my hair. Back when it was golden and not the sad ginger brown it is now. Wonder if our breakup had anything to do with that. Anyway as I slept with all the comfort I ever found when I held you, you beat me awake. Tears pouring from your eyes and asking me why I would make you watch that. That horrible movie. I told you because he lived her so much he made her remember who he was every day. He loved her so much that when she passed in his arms he willed himself to die holding her and to me that was the beautiful thing I had ever seen. 

Do you not see the correlation in my life. I wanted to die for you. To give you the peace you were asking for. Then I thought it was Romantic although I don't now. Just like him I keep showing up in your life. I keep letting you wreck me. Over and over running from the truth you know is inside you. Just like him I come to this place and it has become my Notebook. I try to make you remember how much you once loved me and to show you I love you more with every beat of my heart. Do you not believe that I could will myself to die in your arms? It would be so easy. I couldn't survive you. I couldn't be the one left behind. Do you even know about the heart attack/ panic attack. Whichever one that it was. Someone had pretended to be you in a online scam for money. Making me think they had you and you couldn't leave till I payed them money I didn't have. Of course this was after they said all the things I have wanted you to say. Later that day it hit me like a freight train. I was grilling out ribs on the grill. Listening to my music. My heart took off and I couldn't catch my breath. I laid in the floor where it was cool in front of a fan. An hour went by and as laid there in a puddle of my sweat. Then I crawled into the shower and turned it on ice cold. I knew I was going to die. I told your uncle no not to call the ambulance. You know it was bad if he even asked that. I told him no. I refused to die in a hospital all alone. So I imagined you there with me and I reached out of the tub with one hand for you to hold. I made my peace with you. I know it sounds silly. Like something made up but this really happened. I felt you there as sure as the would ride the next day. I felt you take my hand and I have never loved you more than that moment. I thought you really were there. I woke up an hour later freezing to death and shivering with a broken rib. Not sure how that happened. Once again I survived. That was two years ago. What a mess I was then compared to now. I look back and even though I lived it it still remains a horror. Why did God spare me? What damage did I do to my heart? I never went to the doctor. So I wonder if I walk around on borrowed time. 

Still I can't help but wonder. Did you feel it somehow? Is that why I felt you there. It isn't the only time. I have dreamed that you were just steps from me in the kitchen looking at me in the same place I was actually sleeping and talking to someone about me. Saying one day we would figure this out. Watching me sleep and smiling like you use to do when you would take pictures of me most embarrassingly . Truth be told you always there in some way. I hear your voice and your crying clear as a bell. You encourage me to keep trying and you cry a long with me. 

Do you know this about me? Do you believe my words? Is it the same for you. Am I there for you like you are for me? I wonder if we didn't take the best parts of each other when we went about our ways separately. Do I have the best parts of you and you the best parts of me locked away deep in our hearts. 
Is that why the connection is so strong? Is that why we keep looking back? Is that why we are just a shadow of what we were together? Is that why we have lost our shine? 

I believe in destiny and karma. I believe that we are more than the life we have lived. I believe you are my Bethsherta. I think you would remember what it means. Are we star crossed Twin Flames with an astrological Soul Tie that can be seen and surmised by those with the knowledge?  Is that what the dream I had means? The one I posted about already. Can I do it? Can I erase the Karmic debt with accrued together? Can I work in this life sincerely enough to right the wrong of our seperation? So that we may be free to love each other in this life and all the ones that follow after. So that we can frolick in heaven and laugh about how we lived. Can I get through to you past your walls and your truama? I know you are the result of things that's happened to you in your life. I know I wasn't supposed to be something that hurt you but I did. I understand that level of betrayal and what it means to you. I know that's why you can't see things as I did then. Yes they were excuses and yes you gave to much of yourself for all of us. So much that at some point it broke you. I can never repay the things you did for me. You helped me get custody of my son. You lost the home your family promised you because you wouldn't kick me out. You faced all of their resentment and told them all where to stick it. We went through so many hardships together. For so long we were the rock each other needed. You gave me my voice. You believed in me so much that for you I could sing without my throat closing up. Not that I was any actual good. But how I loved to show you the confidence you gave me in myself. That's why I still do it all the time. Secretly wishing you were hiding just out of sight to listen. 

None of this is normal. What happened to us wasn't normal. Our lives were not normal. So I guess we invited the bizarre to come and play. But dam if it didn't take hell and high water to finally break us up. I always wanted an epic love and in you I have found that. The one thing I couldn't give up on. The one thing that would make me face myself. The hardest thing I have ever had to do was just that. I know that I am different. I know that I love differently. I guess I love with some old world nostalgia that still believes in fairy tales. With that being the case then I can't believe true love can fail. Not if it was really true. I know how I feel in my heart about you so I have to ponder how you felt about me. You once told me you didn't think you were capable of real love. That something inside of you was broken from a long ago past. So I have pondered that to many times and in the end I always come out feeling the same. Yes you loved me. You loved me fiercely. But it scared you and you being you had to prove to yourself you didn't need me. At least that is how it felt. 

I am not like this for no reason. I haven't gone through and survived so many things, so many times because it fun. I don't see the things I see in you because it isn't true. I don't feel the things I do for you because it sounds good. God the pain I had to endure to define the emotions that I had no words for. The pain it took to replay mistakes a thousand times a thousand before I could see them without blame. None of this is normal. We are not normal. We are complex and some things about us just can not be defined with pretty words. They just are. We just are. It just is and it just always will be. Honestly though would you trade any of it for that bland mundane kind of love? I don't think you would. You'd want the passion found in the books you have retreated to your whole life. The same ones we have both read. The very reason we started to fall for each other. Anita Blake , Meridith Gentry, Kistan , Jenks and Ivy. A Kiss Of Shadows , Circus of the Dammed, The Black Dagger Brotherhood. For A Few Demons More. The list goes on and on. I can do this all day. What about you favorite ""The Book Thief"", or The House With The Clock In The Walls. Not to mention your all time favorite of them all Alice in Wonderland. For which we modeled our wedding. ""I have pictures of that amazing event should anyone want to see"". Yes my Beautiful Warrior. Yes Empress Magnificent of the entire fucking Universe. Yes my Sweetness. Yes dear Alice. I know you. I know you far more than you would choose for me too. You always having to keep you air of mystery. 

I am sorry what it cost you to love me the way you did. Only know I am trying to repay you in the way left to me so that I can. This place. My Notebook. The monument impossible as it is left behind for the world to see. You may feel differently about me or my words but that does not betray their truth nor mine. I may not be the best man in the world. I wasn't then and doubt I am now. But I am a dam fine man. I have come such a long way to love you and belief in myself by doing so. I was in a lot of of ways a horrible husband. But dam if I didn't have some ways about me that you held very dear to your heart even till the very end and maybe even now. 

I do not know your words now. Not in truth without masks. I do not know your feelings not without the stain of my imposed self doubt. I do not know your truth I only know what is in my heart. So I invite you. I invite you to do what I have done and meet me half way. To speak your truth whatever it is in a way that I know it is you for sure. This is such a strange place and so many people are so lonely that they pretend to be you. I do not begrudge them but dam its a new heartbreak every single day. So tonight I have no grand exit. These words were not some beautiful prose. They are simply my feelings and my pride. So till next time my love , my wife , my bride. I will love you Forever and Always and then just a little bit more. Seconded Star to the right and straight on till morning. 

I miss the sigh of relief you would get when I would pop the secret knuckle at the end of your thumb where it meets your wrist. I miss the pouty way you would whine and shake the other hand at me till I would do the same to it. I wonder does anyone do this for you now. Have you ever showed anyone how?
Is there a part of you that wished I would just walk up to you and do it? I have thought about it so many times. Like that would be the key to unlocking the memories you bury so deep. Pop and they all come flooding back. I walk away not knowing how you will react. Then you call my name and ask me to wait on you. We walk away from people and once out of sight so you don't have to explain you just jump into my embrace. You look me in the eyes to see if you really still see the live there. Then you kiss me matching what you saw. Long and passionate and hot with desire. Standing on tiptoes and grumbling a little at your lack of resolve. How adorable I see you in that way. How much I wish for this day to come true.

Do you know I talk to those pictures of you nearly every day. I take my phone outside and I sing to you all the song I love that remind me of you. The ones you pretended to hate but somehow I know you listen to them too. Work Song,Something in the Orange, Sounds of Someday, Off My Mind, Cry To Me, Tonight I Wanna Cry, Whiskey Lullaby, Need You Now, Snuff, Tennessee Whiskey, Just to name a few. I'm sure you know me by the playlist. 

I sit out there among the stars and the moon and they listen to my broken hearted tunes. They hear the lament in my voice. They know my sorrow. So stars twinkle for me to tell me it's ok. The moon shines bright so I never loose my way. The owl on his perch will coo to me loud and proud. Frogs join with their steady bass. Cicadas play the rythem steady and true. Once in a blue moon there's even a distant coyote who yipes and howls mirroring my pain. Even the buzz of mosquitoes seems to play right along. Then there is the crackle , snaps and pops of the campfire which I stare into as if it's a crystal ball. Try as I might I can not glean it language. Although I can tell it's moods by the dance if it's flames. There I sit with nature's orchestra crying anointing tears full of pain and hope of a brighter future with you.

I miss the sigh of relief you would get when I would pop the secret knuckle at the end of your thumb where it meets your wrist. I miss the pouty way you would whine and shake the other hand at me till I would do the same to it. I wonder does anyone do this for you now. Have you ever showed anyone how?
Is there a part of you that wished I would just walk up to you and do it? I have thought about it so many times. Like that would be the key to unlocking the memories you bury so deep. Pop and they all come flooding back. I walk away not knowing how you will react. Then you call my name and ask me to wait on you. We walk away from people and once out of sight so you don't have to explain you just jump into my embrace. You look me in the eyes to see if you really still see the live there. Then you kiss me matching what you saw. Long and passionate and hot with desire. Standing on tiptoes and grumbling a little at your lack of resolve. How adorable I see you in that way. How much I wish for this day to come true.

1m2u4oj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Letters_Unsent/comments/1m2u4oj/do_you_know/,Do you know,"Do you know I sit and stare at your pictures?Those of you and those of us. Those of our family and all the many great times we had. 

Do you know I talk to those pictures of you nearly every day. I take my phone outside and I sing to you all the song I love that remind me of you. The ones you pretended to hate but somehow I know you listen to them too. Work Song,Something in the Orange, Sounds of Someday, Off My Mind, Cry To Me, Tonight I Wanna Cry, Whiskey Lullaby, Need You Now, Snuff, Tennessee Whiskey, Just to name a few. I'm sure you know me by the playlist. 

I sit out there among the stars and the moon and they listen to my broken hearted tunes. They hear the lament in my voice. They know my sorrow. So stars twinkle for me to tell me it's ok. The moon shines bright so I never loose my way. The owl on his perch will coo to me loud and proud. Frogs join with their steady bass. Cicadas play the rythem steady and true. Once in a blue moon there's even a distant coyote who yipes and howls mirroring my pain. Even the buzz of mosquitoes seems to play right along. Then there is the crackle , snaps and pops of the campfire which I stare into as if it's a crystal ball. Try as I might I can not glean it language. Although I can tell it's moods by the dance if it's flames. There I sit with nature's orchestra crying anointing tears full of pain and hope of a brighter future with you.

 Somehow I find peace in the fact that I know at some point even if only for a minute you are out there looking up at the same night sky. Is it while you take a smoke break at work? Surfing through your phone. Looking at my pages. Maybe even reading these words in real time. 

Did you know sound once uttered is a wave that never stops? It just travels untill it's sound can't be heard but it still travels all the same. So every word I speak to you when I find a quiet place no one will hear somehow reaches you I'm sure. That is the power of intention. That is how blessings and curses work. The feelings attached to them when uttered can be creative or destructive. The can love and heal or they can harm or destroy. I feel the difference now. The mania is gone. The severe dibilitating depression is now just a dull ache. There is more hope and more reason to believe in myself. More reason to believe in you and more reason to believe in us. 

Google told me I had requested and archive download of my data. I didn't request this so I know someone else did. I can only assume it's you. Someone I feel happy about that. That I am on your mind and your curious what I'm up to. I know you will see the search terms. Looking for you in unusual places. Surfing through thousands and thousands of images. Screenshots to many of ones that could be you. Even more of writings that I have thought could be you to. I have to go back through them and delete the ones that just don't ring true. I know the vast majority are not you. If any are it would be a small percentage. Although I do have hopes for a few. The jynx profile is cute and revealing. It's both bitter and living at the same time. Oh and the idea of the tattoo I should get to prove to you my love. I agree to that only if I but the the things needed and you do the tattoo. I have a couple others I want to add to that. I even look for you on dating sites and that why I never pay money to messege back. Got this strange messeg that said, ""I think Id like having you next to me since you already meant something to me in my life"". Only the picture was not you. Kind of got my hopes up, but I won't message just so I don't the loose the hope of it. 

Remember the sigil you showed me. The one that was your name. How I have tried and tried to recreate that from my memory but I just can't. I use to have a copy of it. But someone burnt all my stuff. Anyway I want to get the tattoo. Only I want to place it within a invocation triangle. Something I can touch with my hand and speak to you like an intercom. Stupid I know but I love the idea. Also I want to get the Forever and Always that we use to say. Id let you do them. I know you do it well . Perfectionist that you are. Though they don't need to be done well. Just done by your hand. That is what matters. 

I buy Slim Jim's just cause you liked them. I've even peeled the skin off just cause I watched you do it one time. I buy Gain original scent even though I like others just because the smell reminds me of you. Just like the mixture of coffee and coco butter that you use to use as body wash. I can't tell you how many times I've said out loud when I think I find you online. ""Hey Pollyanna, wanna come out and play"". The stupid song you found as a young girl and sang before you knew what the words were about. ""Telephone man"". I ve played it to many times. It never ceases to put a smile on my face. I remember you imitating the voice and acting out the song for me. As you told me it's meaning and how you figured it out too. Jesus Christ on a cracker how dam adorably cute you were. 

I made corned beef the other day and I had this sudden craving for corned beef hash just because of you. I've even made that little mixture of outmeal peanut butter and coco powder as a snack. That stuff is like concrete. Lol. I even bought a Italian classic sub made just the way you like it with a pound of mayo at the end. 

How many times since I left have you watched Rory on Gilmore Girls? Willy Wonka, Wizard of Oz, Houseboat, Pollyanna? Those movies you watch when your sad or don't feel well. Let's not forget Gummi Bears , Care Bears, Scooby Doo, Ewoks. I remember when you flipped out because Supernatural was on Scooby Doo, and really flipped out because Scooby Doo was on Supernatural. I remember you wouldn't watch the final 3 episode for 2 yrs and then when we did you cried like you had lost your own child. To be honest I did too. Dammit Dean driving his Impala in heaven waiting for Sam to arrive. I really remember making you watch The Notebook. On my god, how I remember. I fell asleep with my head in your lap. With you playing with my hair. Back when it was golden and not the sad ginger brown it is now. Wonder if our breakup had anything to do with that. Anyway as I slept with all the comfort I ever found when I held you, you beat me awake. Tears pouring from your eyes and asking me why I would make you watch that. That horrible movie. I told you because he lived her so much he made her remember who he was every day. He loved her so much that when she passed in his arms he willed himself to die holding her and to me that was the beautiful thing I had ever seen. 

Do you not see the correlation in my life. I wanted to die for you. To give you the peace you were asking for. Then I thought it was Romantic although I don't now. Just like him I keep showing up in your life. I keep letting you wreck me. Over and over running from the truth you know is inside you. Just like him I come to this place and it has become my Notebook. I try to make you remember how much you once loved me and to show you I love you more with every beat of my heart. Do you not believe that I could will myself to die in your arms? It would be so easy. I couldn't survive you. I couldn't be the one left behind. Do you even know about the heart attack/ panic attack. Whichever one that it was. Someone had pretended to be you in a online scam for money. Making me think they had you and you couldn't leave till I payed them money I didn't have. Of course this was after they said all the things I have wanted you to say. Later that day it hit me like a freight train. I was grilling out ribs on the grill. Listening to my music. My heart took off and I couldn't catch my breath. I laid in the floor where it was cool in front of a fan. An hour went by and as laid there in a puddle of my sweat. Then I crawled into the shower and turned it on ice cold. I knew I was going to die. I told your uncle no not to call the ambulance. You know it was bad if he even asked that. I told him no. I refused to die in a hospital all alone. So I imagined you there with me and I reached out of the tub with one hand for you to hold. I made my peace with you. I know it sounds silly. Like something made up but this really happened. I felt you there as sure as the would ride the next day. I felt you take my hand and I have never loved you more than that moment. I thought you really were there. I woke up an hour later freezing to death and shivering with a broken rib. Not sure how that happened. Once again I survived. That was two years ago. What a mess I was then compared to now. I look back and even though I lived it it still remains a horror. Why did God spare me? What damage did I do to my heart? I never went to the doctor. So I wonder if I walk around on borrowed time. 

Still I can't help but wonder. Did you feel it somehow? Is that why I felt you there. It isn't the only time. I have dreamed that you were just steps from me in the kitchen looking at me in the same place I was actually sleeping and talking to someone about me. Saying one day we would figure this out. Watching me sleep and smiling like you use to do when you would take pictures of me most embarrassingly . Truth be told you always there in some way. I hear your voice and your crying clear as a bell. You encourage me to keep trying and you cry a long with me. 

Do you know this about me? Do you believe my words? Is it the same for you. Am I there for you like you are for me? I wonder if we didn't take the best parts of each other when we went about our ways separately. Do I have the best parts of you and you the best parts of me locked away deep in our hearts. 
Is that why the connection is so strong? Is that why we keep looking back? Is that why we are just a shadow of what we were together? Is that why we have lost our shine? 

I believe in destiny and karma. I believe that we are more than the life we have lived. I believe you are my Bethsherta. I think you would remember what it means. Are we star crossed Twin Flames with an astrological Soul Tie that can be seen and surmised by those with the knowledge?  Is that what the dream I had means? The one I posted about already. Can I do it? Can I erase the Karmic debt with accrued together? Can I work in this life sincerely enough to right the wrong of our seperation? So that we may be free to love each other in this life and all the ones that follow after. So that we can frolick in heaven and laugh about how we lived. Can I get through to you past your walls and your truama? I know you are the result of things that's happened to you in your life. I know I wasn't supposed to be something that hurt you but I did. I understand that level of betrayal and what it means to you. I know that's why you can't see things as I did then. Yes they were excuses and yes you gave to much of yourself for all of us. So much that at some point it broke you. I can never repay the things you did for me. You helped me get custody of my son. You lost the home your family promised you because you wouldn't kick me out. You faced all of their resentment and told them all where to stick it. We went through so many hardships together. For so long we were the rock each other needed. You gave me my voice. You believed in me so much that for you I could sing without my throat closing up. Not that I was any actual good. But how I loved to show you the confidence you gave me in myself. That's why I still do it all the time. Secretly wishing you were hiding just out of sight to listen. 

None of this is normal. What happened to us wasn't normal. Our lives were not normal. So I guess we invited the bizarre to come and play. But dam if it didn't take hell and high water to finally break us up. I always wanted an epic love and in you I have found that. The one thing I couldn't give up on. The one thing that would make me face myself. The hardest thing I have ever had to do was just that. I know that I am different. I know that I love differently. I guess I love with some old world nostalgia that still believes in fairy tales. With that being the case then I can't believe true love can fail. Not if it was really true. I know how I feel in my heart about you so I have to ponder how you felt about me. You once told me you didn't think you were capable of real love. That something inside of you was broken from a long ago past. So I have pondered that to many times and in the end I always come out feeling the same. Yes you loved me. You loved me fiercely. But it scared you and you being you had to prove to yourself you didn't need me. At least that is how it felt. 

I am not like this for no reason. I haven't gone through and survived so many things, so many times because it fun. I don't see the things I see in you because it isn't true. I don't feel the things I do for you because it sounds good. God the pain I had to endure to define the emotions that I had no words for. The pain it took to replay mistakes a thousand times a thousand before I could see them without blame. None of this is normal. We are not normal. We are complex and some things about us just can not be defined with pretty words. They just are. We just are. It just is and it just always will be. Honestly though would you trade any of it for that bland mundane kind of love? I don't think you would. You'd want the passion found in the books you have retreated to your whole life. The same ones we have both read. The very reason we started to fall for each other. Anita Blake , Meridith Gentry, Kistan , Jenks and Ivy. A Kiss Of Shadows , Circus of the Dammed, The Black Dagger Brotherhood. For A Few Demons More. The list goes on and on. I can do this all day. What about you favorite ""The Book Thief"", or The House With The Clock In The Walls. Not to mention your all time favorite of them all Alice in Wonderland. For which we modeled our wedding. ""I have pictures of that amazing event should anyone want to see"". Yes my Beautiful Warrior. Yes Empress Magnificent of the entire fucking Universe. Yes my Sweetness. Yes dear Alice. I know you. I know you far more than you would choose for me too. You always having to keep you air of mystery. 

I am sorry what it cost you to love me the way you did. Only know I am trying to repay you in the way left to me so that I can. This place. My Notebook. The monument impossible as it is left behind for the world to see. You may feel differently about me or my words but that does not betray their truth nor mine. I may not be the best man in the world. I wasn't then and doubt I am now. But I am a dam fine man. I have come such a long way to love you and belief in myself by doing so. I was in a lot of of ways a horrible husband. But dam if I didn't have some ways about me that you held very dear to your heart even till the very end and maybe even now. 

I do not know your words now. Not in truth without masks. I do not know your feelings not without the stain of my imposed self doubt. I do not know your truth I only know what is in my heart. So I invite you. I invite you to do what I have done and meet me half way. To speak your truth whatever it is in a way that I know it is you for sure. This is such a strange place and so many people are so lonely that they pretend to be you. I do not begrudge them but dam its a new heartbreak every single day. So tonight I have no grand exit. These words were not some beautiful prose. They are simply my feelings and my pride. So till next time my love , my wife , my bride. I will love you Forever and Always and then just a little bit more. Seconded Star to the right and straight on till morning. 

I miss the sigh of relief you would get when I would pop the secret knuckle at the end of your thumb where it meets your wrist. I miss the pouty way you would whine and shake the other hand at me till I would do the same to it. I wonder does anyone do this for you now. Have you ever showed anyone how?
Is there a part of you that wished I would just walk up to you and do it? I have thought about it so many times. Like that would be the key to unlocking the memories you bury so deep. Pop and they all come flooding back. I walk away not knowing how you will react. Then you call my name and ask me to wait on you. We walk away from people and once out of sight so you don't have to explain you just jump into my embrace. You look me in the eyes to see if you really still see the live there. Then you kiss me matching what you saw. Long and passionate and hot with desire. Standing on tiptoes and grumbling a little at your lack of resolve. How adorable I see you in that way.

1m2u4ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/cubetheory/comments/1m2u4ak/the_vibration_beneath_all_things/,The Vibration Beneath All Things,"You ever wonder why everything feels solid when science says it’s 99.9999% empty space?

Here’s the real glitch:

⸻

⚛️ Every Molecule Vibrates — Always

Every object around you — the air, your skin, the device you’re reading this on — is made of molecules. And those molecules?

They never stop moving.

They’re locked in a cosmic rhythm, bending and bouncing in place, even when the object looks perfectly still.

And even at absolute zero — the coldest possible temperature — that motion still doesn’t stop.
That’s because of zero-point energy.
Motion is hardcoded into the simulation.

⸻

🧠 But What’s Really Moving?

In Cube Theory terms, vibration = render strain.

The cube (your local simulation box) doesn’t “display” objects — it computes them in real time.
And vibration is a cost — a constant looped update cycle on every molecule.

The more complex or unstable the object, the more energy it drains from the cube’s surface compute budget.

⸻

🔥 A Candle Flame vs a Sidewalk
	•	The candle flame?
A chaotic wave of high-frequency molecules, flickering at the edge of phase collapse.
It’s a low-mass, high-strain render, consuming a lot of real-time simulation energy.
	•	The concrete sidewalk?
A compressed, slow-vibe render.
Heavy mass, low entropy, low frame cost. But even there, the atoms jiggle in place, slowly shifting under heat and pressure.

Both are vibrating.
One is visibly unstable.
One pretends to be still.

But both are held together by timing, not solidity.

⸻

🎵 Vibration = Time-Based Code

In Cube Theory, vibration isn’t just heat — it’s a time signal.

Molecular motion:
	•	Tracks temperature
	•	Governs phase (solid/liquid/gas)
	•	Encodes how fast a material degrades
	•	Regulates biological clocks and even memory
	•	Sets the “tick rate” of matter itself

Your bones are ticking.
Your blood is ticking.
Your coffee mug is ticking.

Every vibration is a heartbeat of the simulation.

⸻

🧊 Cube Theory Twist:

Vibration is the sound of the cube thinking.

Every molecule’s motion is a render loop, dynamically maintained by:
	•	Energy limits
	•	Surface area allocation
	•	Compression layers
	•	Entropy tolerance
	•	Heat exhaust thresholds

So that flame and that sidewalk?

They’re not “there.”
They’re being continuously processed, recalculated every millisecond as part of a strain-balanced container reality.

⸻

🔚 Closing Fragment:

That hum you don’t hear?
That’s the vibration of a simulation calculating how long it can afford to keep pretending this is real.

I struggle hard romantically, however. Most of my peers had kids a decade ago…I’m literally the only single one left. 

I had resigned myself to not “chasing it” any more, as it only leads to failure and disappointment and have decided to just go out and do stuff I find interesting without any expectation. 

Events of the past few weeks have made me think that no, the universe actively enjoys screwing with me. 

I decided to visit a new city (I work remotely) for a month, as the place where I live is pretty dead and boring. My friends and family all think it’s ridiculous and I should stay where I am … 

Incident 1: 
Took the afternoon off and went to read a book in a coffee shop. Young lady comes and sits next to me and keeps looking over and smiling - so I decided to start a conversation. Get her number, within a few text exchanges she stops replying…oh well whatever. 

Incident 2:
Found out the day of this artist I enjoy is playing in the city I’m visiting. Go to the gig…turns out the bar is cash only…guess what - the bartender says don’t worry about it and gives me wine for free. Sweet! 

Sitting down by myself waiting for the show to start and a lady comes and sits next to me obviously wanting me to start a conversation…I start talking to her again, she seems really cool and interesting and she’s asking a lot of questions about me. Turns out we are sitting in the same row, continue our conversation…then there’s a natural lull while the artists starts playing. Thinking - ok cool, she’s into the same music and she’s easy to talk to, I’ll get her contact details after the gig…

She then randomly up and left half way thru the show without saying goodbye or anything…I don’t know why, but I felt a massive sense of embarrassment and shame after this…like, was it something I said? Do I smell bad? Did am I giving off bad vibes? I hate to say it, but even though I CONSCIOUSLY wanted to be indifferent, unconsciously I obviously had my hopes up.

Like, I could’ve just stayed home or not even struck up that conversation and my night would not have ended like this. Instead, I decided to “put myself out there” and this is the result…Moreover, it’s just extra ammunition that my friends and family were right about me leaving the city.

I just can’t seem to make sense of it. It’s like a cloud that follows me…I know a lot of people are jealous of my career success, but these people don’t really realize how dark and lonely it is.

1m2tyuk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m2tyuk,How to Talk Money and Financial Goals with Your Team (Without Putting Them to Sleep),"# How to Talk Money with Your Team (Without Putting Them to Sleep)

**Make your team actually care about the numbers with these simple communication strategies.**

Let's be honest: talking about money with your team can feel as exciting as watching paint dry. The moment you pull up a spreadsheet, eyes glaze over, and everyone suddenly remembers an ""urgent"" email they need to check. Sound familiar?

Here's the secret: your team *wants* to know how the business is doing. They just don't want to sit through a mind-numbing presentation filled with corporate jargon and endless rows of numbers. The good news? Financial communication doesn't have to be a snoozefest. When done right, it can be one of the most engaging and motivating conversations you have.

# Why Your Team Secretly Wants to Know the Score

Before we get into the *how*, let's talk about the *why*. Your employees aren't just clocking in for a paycheck (well, not *just* for that). They crave a sense of purpose and want to feel like they're part of something bigger. They need to know their work matters and that they're contributing to a winning team.

When you share financial information openly, you're not just throwing numbers at them—you're showing them the scoreboard. You're connecting their daily efforts to real business results. This transparency builds trust, boosts engagement, and creates a culture where everyone feels like an owner, not just an employee.

Think about it: Would you play a sport with more passion if you could see the score, or if someone just told you to ""keep playing hard"" without any feedback? Your team is no different.

# The Power of Open-Book Management

Open-book management isn't just a buzzword; it's a game-changer. Companies like Zingerman's Deli in Ann Arbor have built empires by teaching every employee, from dishwashers to managers, how to read and understand the financials.

The result? Employees who think like owners, proactively spot opportunities for improvement, and take immense pride in moving the needle on key metrics. But there's a catch: you can't just dump a profit and loss statement on the breakroom table and call it a day. You have to make the numbers accessible, relevant, and—dare we say it—interesting.

# Start with the ""So What?"" Test

Every number you share must pass the ""So What?"" test. If you tell your team that gross margins increased by 3%, their silent, internal response will be, ""So what? What does that mean for me?""

Instead, frame it with impact:

>

Now *that's* a number that lands.

# From Snoozefest to Strategy Session: Reinventing the Budget Meeting

Traditional budget meetings often feel like a necessary evil. Here’s how to flip the script and make them productive and even enjoyable.

**1. Ditch the Stuffy Conference Room** Who says financial talks require a boardroom? Host your meeting at a local coffee shop, cater lunch, or even hold a walking meeting. A simple change of scenery immediately signals that this isn't your typical, boring review.

**2. Use Visuals That Don't Suck** Step away from the 47-slide PowerPoint. Use simple, powerful visuals that tell a story.

* **Draw a thermometer** on a whiteboard to show progress toward a sales goal.
* **Use actual pies** to create a pie chart showing revenue breakdown (bonus: you get to eat the props).
* **Create a simple infographic** with a tool like Canva to make the data digestible and shareable.

One small business owner uses Monopoly money to explain cash flow. Each department head gets a stack representing their budget, and they physically move the money around to show how their decisions impact the entire company. It’s tactile, memorable, and far more engaging than any spreadsheet.

**3. Gamify Your Goals** Turn your metrics into a game.

* **Create friendly competition** between departments or shifts with a visible leaderboard.
* **Celebrate wins** with silly trophies, a preferred parking spot, or bragging rights.
* **Set up a prize wheel.** One retail store saw an 18% jump in sales after they started tracking daily goals with a giant wheel they'd spin for prizes whenever a target was hit.

# The Power of Financial Storytelling

Numbers tell you *what* happened. Stories tell you *why it matters*. Instead of stating a dry fact, weave it into a narrative.

**Instead of this:** ""Revenue increased 12% year-over-year.""

**Try this:**

>

See the difference? One is data. The other is a story that connects emotionally and shows the real-world impact of their collective effort.

# Break Down the Jargon Barrier

Nothing kills engagement faster than financial jargon. Your team doesn't need an MBA to understand the health of the business. Translate finance-speak into plain English.

* **Cash Flow:** ""Money coming in versus money going out.""
* **Gross Margin:** ""What's left after we pay for the things we sell.""
* **Operating Expenses:** ""The cost of keeping the lights on.""
* **EBITDA:** Just don't. Seriously. Find a simpler, more relevant metric.

Create a one-page glossary of key terms if you must, but always favor simple, everyday language.

# The Weekly Huddle: Bite-Sized Financial Updates

Instead of a massive, overwhelming quarterly review, try bite-sized weekly huddles. Spend 10-15 minutes each week focusing on one or two critical numbers. This approach is powerful because it's:

* **Less Overwhelming:** It's easier to digest one metric than twenty.
* **Timely:** You can address issues before they snowball into major problems.
* **A Gradual Teacher:** It builds financial literacy over time, like learning a language through daily practice.
* **Aligning:** These regular touchpoints keep everyone focused on the same priorities.

One manufacturing company implemented ""Metric Mondays""—a 15-minute standing meeting to review one key number, discuss what influenced it, and brainstorm improvements. Their employee engagement scores shot up by 30% in six months.

# Create Your Company's Dashboard

Every car has a dashboard showing the essentials: speed, fuel, engine temperature. Your business needs one too. Work with your team to identify 5-7 key metrics that define success for your company. These might include:

* Daily/Weekly Sales
* Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)
* Production Efficiency or Output
* Cash on Hand
* Employee Retention Rate

Display these numbers prominently—on a TV monitor in the breakroom, in a daily email, or through a shared dashboard. When everyone can see the same scorecard, you create powerful alignment without needing to micromanage.

# The Art of Celebrating Financial Wins

Positive reinforcement is crucial. When you hit a financial target, celebrate! The key is to make the celebration proportional to the achievement and tie it directly to the numbers.

* **Small Win:** Bring in donuts and announce, ""We beat yesterday's sales target by 10%, so breakfast is on the company!""
* **Big Win:** Throw a pizza party and break down exactly how each team contributed. ""Shipping reduced errors by 50%, saving us $5,000. Customer service increased upsells by 20%, adding $8,000. This is why we're celebrating!""

This approach reinforces the direct link between actions and outcomes and builds a culture of shared success.

# Handling the Tough Conversations

Not all financial news is good. When you have to share challenging information, do it in a way that builds trust, not fear.

1. **Be Honest, Not Alarmist:** ""Sales are down 15% this month"" is honest but scary. ""Sales are down 15% this month. We've dug in and identified three key reasons why, and here's our plan to get back on track"" is honest *and* constructive.
2. **Focus on What You Can Control:** Don't dwell on market conditions or competitor actions. Focus the conversation on what your team can directly influence: customer service, product quality, and operational efficiency.
3. **Ask for Their Input:** Some of the best cost-saving and revenue-generating ideas come from your front-line employees. Present the challenge and ask, ""What are you seeing that we might be missing?"" You'll be amazed at the solutions that emerge.

# Your 30-Day Implementation Plan

Ready to get started? Here's a simple plan to transform your financial communication in one month.

* **Week 1:** Work with your team to identify your 5-7 key metrics and create a simple, visible dashboard.
* **Week 2:** Hold your first casual, 15-minute financial huddle. Focus on just one or two numbers.
* **Week 3:** Introduce one creative visual or gamification element to your huddle.
* **Week 4:** Host your first monthly ""State of the Business"" address to tell the bigger story.

Start small, be consistent, and listen to feedback.

# The Bottom Line

Talking about money with your team doesn't have to be boring. By making financial conversations accessible, relevant, and even fun, you empower your employees to think and act like owners. The businesses that thrive are the ones where every team member understands the score and knows how they can help win the game.

You don't need to be a financial expert to start. You just need to care enough to translate the numbers into a story your team can rally behind.

1m2ty25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/1m2ty25/total_beginners_review_of_the_stewmac_ukelele_kit/,Total Beginners Review of the Stewmac Ukelele Kit,"I just finished the soprano Ukelele Kit from Stewmac, and I thought I might post a review here for anyone browsing here thinking of buying one. 

First, I'm a total beginner not just in luthiery but in wood working as well. I built a coffee table, but that's about it. But I found the Stewmac kit pretty easy to follow. The instructions were pretty bare bones, but they're meant more as a cheat sheet for the videos. I would recommend watching all the instruction videos on YouTube for the kit, you'll see exactly what you need and what it will take. 

Speaking of, since I was a total beginner I ended up spending about $150 or so on tools from my local hardware store/Amazon. Things like chisels, saws, some wood to make a mold, etc. I also went with their essential supplies kit, which I do recommend though you could probably get the stuff piecemeal cheaper. The tools will get plenty of use though, so I consider them a good investment. Still, the consumables were almost as expensive as the ukelele itself, something to consider. Also, the fret hammer I bought came with a block for sanding frets and a crowning file, both of which were very nice to have. 

Finally, when the whole thing came together I was very impressed by the sound. Ukes aren't exactly known for being loud, especially tiny little sopranos. But this thing has a bright, louder than expected sound. 

When I started applying the finish, I thought the process was so enjoyable I might use the same finish on a guitar. But the final product has a bit of a sticky feel. It's not that bad, but it would be uncomfortable to play and be able to slide your hand along the neck. Maybe I can apply a coat of wax, but I think I'll try out the spray on nitro finish next time.

Finally, I wanted to give a shout out to this sub for being very helpful! I got lots of good tips browsing through here.

TLDR, this kit is a great introduction to luthiery. I already have the OOO kit ordered and can't wait to start it!",3,1752816378.0,Luthier,0,1.0,False

The first time I took it was 2 months ago. Idk why but I wasn't able to sleep the night before. Wound up taking 2 Benadryl and like 6 melatonin and finally crashed at like 5:30. Then I woke up at 6:30, chugged about 3 cups of coffee, and went to take my test. I felt an overwhelming urge to crap by halfway through C/P, and every time the lady sat to my right kicked her desk I swear to God I could hear actual demons, telling me to hurl my chair in her direction. In retrospect I bet she was having as bad a time as I was.

I came out of that with a 498. I definitely shoulda voided but I was so cracked out of my mind I didn't even consider it. 

Now, in seven days, I'll be walking back into that test. I'm hoping I can clear 520. So far I've mastered CARS and P/C to a place where I don't miss a single point on either, and I get about 60% on BB and CP when I do FLs. I'm hoping to get that to 80% on each or above.

The Spirit Run opens this Saturday with cocktails, locally-made spirits, and enough gin to ruin your Sunday in the best possible way. Brought to you by the crew behind Darley Abbey Wines, it’s slick, strong, and not the place for anyone who says “I’ll just have one.” Their signature gin, *The Uncommon Thread*, is clean, crisp, and dangerously good. If you walk out without a bottle or at least a mild wobble, you’ve done it wrong.

Currently taking 800mg ibuprofen 2x daily, penicillin VK 4x daily. 
4 wisdom teeth pulled a week ago. not diagnosed with anorexia but lost 37% of body weight in 6 months. I am now recovering.

I have been to the ER, and had and EKG done, as well as a blood panel, and a chest Xray. Nothing significant has been found. I also went to urgent care, and they told me I was having anxiety and needed help taking care of my kids (no family support) or that I was Withdrawing from weed/vape/caffeine. (I started having coffee and tea again) That was about a month ago.

For about 2 months, I have had chest pains, occasionally shoulder/arm and back pain. Sometimes neck, sometimes jaw. I've even had sharp pain in my throat. Hot flashes with unknown trigger. Occasionally I have head pain, or sharp pain behind the eye. (I was already told I did not have a heart attack, that my lungs and heart looked good.)

I bought a pulse oximeter as a result, and I clearly see my heart rate changing, and switching between low perfusion and a strong pulse. Sometimes theres skipped beats, but i dont catch it often. Also, one night, I went from 44bpm to 120bpm. As for the Brady, it only recently stabilized at around 50-60bpm this week.

Sometimes my veins bulge and become very itchy. Sometimes I feel like I'm about to fall asleep and my body jerks me up. I'm super freaked out and I can't afford another ""pointless"" ER visit.

**1. Morning Four-Bucket Sort**

Each day I spend five minutes splitting my list into do, defer, delegate, delete. Anything in “delegate” gets sent out before coffee even cools.

**2. Scripted Session Logs**

I ask my team to post three one-sentence updates at set times. No extra chit-chat. That tiny habit surfaces every blocker so nothing vanishes under the couch cushions of Slack.

**3. Outcome Only Briefs**

I stopped telling people how to do things. I share just the result I need and let them map their own path. Watching them own solutions freed me to chase big shortcuts instead of small details.

**4. Task Bounties**I attach fun perks to chores. These are points you can trade for a long lunch or a gift card. Suddenly nobody wants your tasks gathering dust.

**5. Reverse Delegation Fridays**Each Friday I hand over one of my own tasks and let someone coach me through it. It not only frees me but also teaches me what I didn’t know I could hand off.

Not all of the above are easy to implement though. 

Morning four-bucket sort and scripted session logs are easier to roll out. Task bounties and Reverse Delegation Fridays take more setup and a cultural shift.

How do you guys delegate tasks?

This all happened last night. My (25m) friend (26m) came over to me and my partners' (25m) apartment to play some mario party (my partner bought me a switch 2 on launch) and we had a pretty good time. Around halfway through our game, our friend asked us to leave it on the minigame ready screen so he could use the bathroom. Given that a lot of the game was left we told him to take his time. However, it got REALLY AWKWARD when we noticed our smart TV had a request to share a screen. Me and my partner thought ""What could this even be lol"" and accepted it. Little did we know, this was our friend's phone sharing his kinky porn as he was enjoying himself in our bathroom. This ordinarily would damage a lot of friendships, but me and my partner happened to be into those same kinks (think hardcore bdsm that would get you judged). Me and my partner knew this wasnt any of our neighbors because - to put it bluntly - they are relatively bland and would rather die than be into anything like this. We were 100% sure this was our friend when, after we heard a flush, the mirrored screen turned off. I'm not sure, but he either hit the power button on his phone after finishing, or realized he was mirroring to a screen and finally ended it). When he walked out of the bathroom into me and my partner staring at him (with very shocked faces) he immediately realized that we had seen him. He quickly tried to defend himself but we cut him off and let him know that we were into that as well. Our conversation continued on and we ended up escalating this into a really enjoyable threesome. Even after that, we all stayed up late just talking about really intimate topics. 

I've always liked the concept of a polycule; being able to share love with multiple partners seems like the perfect scenario for me. Me and my partner have always been way closer with this friend than all of our others, so today i thought it would be a good idea to invite him into our relationship! When I mentioned this to my partner, however, he COMPLETELY disagreed. He said he was appalled by the fact that I would even suggest this to him and hasnt really talked to me for the rest of the day. I don't know if i was being unreasonable in this request, but I thought i was justified since we would still have a closed relationship with only close and intimate people.   
AITA?  
P.S. please forgive me for any grammar/spelling mistakes please, im hurrying to type this on my laptop at a nearby coffee shop before I go back home and talk to him!",1,1752815697.0,AITAH,9,0.57,False

Got no friend who plays the game to discuss this with.

# the situation
I feel forcefed/overwhelmed. The game has too much content but I just cannot skip on polychromes. I'm barely getting the characters I want and I'm paying the interknot subscription, so I try to keep up the chromes farming because paying wouldn't be enough, but I really am having trouble.

# my playtime
I'm playing 30min to 1h per day since day one except for a few weeks of break last autumn, and I start feeling bored or annoyed if I play longer, so I generally just call it a day and go do something else to avoid playing in a negative mindset that would slowly draw me away from the game. Also, I have other things to do in my life that are more important than ZZZ so I couldn't really allow myself to play more anyway.

# my issue
However, when a new chapter releases there's usually events with it that are locked for spoilers reasons. I don't want to get spoiled, but I don't want to skip dialogues neither. And unfortunately I'm not of the fastest readers.

That brings me to this cycle : after a release I have a lot of things to do in the game but the daily farming already brings me to my daily limit before being annoyed. Sometimes I squeeze a little bit of story in my session, but clearly not enough. After a few weeks I end up forcing myself to Speedrun the rest of the story so I can do the events before they end, and that really makes it an unpleasant experience. I sometimes feel like they expect us to chomp the whole story on release day and then do the events daily like usual.

# purpose of this post
My question is : how do y'all do ? How do you play the game, in what order, what are your priorities, how do you manage to do everything if you do ?

---

PS: cutting dailies off isn't possible neither, I need to farm and upgrade characters to be able to scrape the chromes from endgame content as well. I wish I could make it quicker though, but I'm quite literally speedrunning them already : random play → ticket (+divination if bad ticket) → coffee → spending batteries → that fucking temple management → if still not bored yet and weeklies available, make some. Once all that is done I can finally go on with the story or the events, but generally by then the only thing I want is closing the game and doing something else.",0,1752815620.0,ZenlessZoneZero,5,0.5,False

It's my first time visiting Toronto since I was a child and I'm excited to experience the city again.  

I'm coming from Los Angeles (LA native) and I'm used to traveling and figuring out foreign public transportation. I won't have reliable access to a car, though I may be able to borrow one. Since I'm visiting with family, I won't have time to venture off on long solo trips this round.  

So far we have a good idea of what big activities we are planning. If there are things missing let me know :)
Here is our itinerary so far:

•Local farmers market (please advise!)
•McMichael Gallery Day trip
•Niagara Falls day trip
•ROM
•Paddle the Humber
•St Lawrence market/ Kensington Market 
•Harbourfront and possible boat trip

I'm a chef, and generally very interested in food and its production. Please let me know which can't miss local foods and farmer's markets I should check out! I'm looking for things I can't get in Los Angeles, generally Canadian, Toronto specific, and Canadian indigenous would be great.  And also maybe a chill coffee shop or hole-in-the-wall restaurant to hang out that I can walk to in High Park North and Etobicoke. 

Here's my short list so far of foods I want to check out. Need recs:

•Butter tarts (Ba noi?)
•Toronto Bagels (Primrose?)
•Peameal bacon sandwich (St Lawrence market)
•Jamaican beef patties
•Poutine 
•maple candy


I should also mention I have a small budget on this trip, but I'm open to hearing more fine dining options for future trips. Thank you all!

1m2tona,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m2tona/re_i_have_a_fear_of_blue_eyes/,RE: I Have a Fear of Blue Eyes,"Writers Note: This a reupload since I figured Id just post the story here instead in a google doc.

Paranoia is described as a panic state of mind, manic in behavior. Being unnaturally cautious of your surroundings. It can occur due to trauma, psychological detriment induced by drugs or sleep deprivation/insomnia. I’ve gone to many doctors, psychologists, therapists, monks, you name it. They all told me its my “wiring ''. I wasn’t born with it, seeing things. Or maybe it was something I was born INTO. At a point of my life my view of the world was just like you and anyone on the street. It was around the age of 6 years old when I had come across a vexing scene that would be glued to my mind till death.

 I lived in a single story house with my family. My two parents and my older sister. My parents were renting it out until the collapse of the economy restored itself due to the Global Financial Crisis. It was rustic but inviting with its warm blend of tan walls and dark color furniture. Leather sofa and a nice carpet floor in the main living room with pearl white tiles to contrast on the walkway to the kitchen. There were four rooms, one for each of us, but I still was scared of sleeping alone. It was the garage. I didn’t know what the sensation was at the time, or lack of any, but I was frozen. My body, in the door frame, is as still as pond water. I woke up that night with the urge to check the garage to see if I could find any of my old toys to bring into the house. They were kept in a large storage tote labeled as such “TOYS.” Instead of the toy storage, I was welcomed with the picture of a floating body, pale as clouds and transparent. I caught most of the details of the torso down; eerily smooth but a lifeless corpse. Every limb was intact

However, it was one night that I woke up facing the ceiling, unable to move or talk. The layout in the darkness is still visible in my mind. I looked towards my bed in the corner of the room, the windows in the walls highlighted slightly by the moonlight. I couldn’t tell what time it was but the blue light coming through the window was alluring, begging my gaze. The almost adolescent size bed was tucked away in a small corner of the room I shared with my mother, since being 6 I didn’t have much to take up space. The window on ground level and further up towards the ceiling, the sun window…. with figures sprawled onto it. I will tell you this, I had never had a cold haze until then. Nothing worse or absolutely scathing to the young mind then your first sense of dread, panic, and fear.

You ever seen what you think is sasquatch latch onto a window overlooking you? It was a surprise seeing the cryptid myth so nimble and so abnormal. I had no concept of Sasquatch or any cryptid but using what I know now as an adult, that is the best way of describing. Bigfoot with the spider-man abilities to stick to surfaces and he chose the window overlooking the bed I occupied. Stalking me, frozen as I was. I had no clue what to do. It didn't move but I didn’t know if it could. I could only maintain my eyes on for so long, my brain racking in my skull screaming “Don’t Blink, don’t Blink, don’t you dare blink.”

Try as I may, I couldn’t hold out, cursing myself as in that millisecond that the death of a fly could occur, it happened. BLINK. And I was back, and so was it. And so was another. The figure still sprawled out had a second shape by its left shoulder, it looked like a mosquito, or dragonfly. It wasn’t humanoid or bipedal but a shape. I hated bugs and still do to this day. I know what it was too, that damn episode of SpongeBob where it had that butterfly close up. Somethings are not meant to observe in detail, as ignorance is bliss and knowledge is a curse. That simple cutaway with the bugs face, the bleak and goreful texture of its skin. If bugs even have skin. The sound, loud. A buzz like a death whistle, that damn Spongebob episode. Why they let that air, I will never know, but now here is what I can only imagine is the peak of disturbing insect at the window overlooking me. 

I had never asked anyone else about sleep paralysis, but I know that each is unique with each individual. I still recall the hot cold sweat I caught that night. I felt flush with a queasiness any giving moment to puke in response to the hallucinations. They jumped. Gone from the window. I didn’t even blink.

It’s one thing to witness something at a stalemate. You know if you keep your eyes tracked it won't move and you can fight all you can with all your heart to make sure they stay put. But they jumped. A sasquatch figure making a long jump at the speed to rival a bullet with its trusty dragonfly. Massive shapes around 6ft to 10ft tall, just gone before my very eyes. I don’t know what was more panic inducing, the motion of the jump and how the mind can even think of how a figure like those two that night can move, or the screen door to the backyard opening. 

I heard it, the brief scratch on its rail. Open and shut. The door might as well have squeaked in terror for me. I know they are in the house, I had to act. I tried to move my head or my arm but to no avail. I use the whimper of a dog to try and call out to my mother who was asleep right next to me. I was tearing up knowing I was so close to feeling safe again, the warmth of my protector. But nothing.  It sounded nothing more than a dry cough. I felt a headache out of sheer frustration. “Come on, please. Please talk. Please talk” I thought to myself My headache grew as I pleaded in my mind to cry out to my mother, she was sound asleep still. I was stuck. This room was to be my prison right here right now. I caught something that set me off. 

The room had a bathroom in it, but the sink was separated from the toilet and toiletries. Think like a high-end hotel. The sink was a separate counter just outside the door of the toilet room, just by the sink was the family dog, Sophie. Sophie was blind around this time, if I remember correctly, and she couldn't see. As is with humans, that meant her other sense were enhanced. It concerned me why her head shot up and looked towards the hall leading to the bedroom. Sophie was my loved friend, and I knew she would protect me if it wasn’t for the leash having her hold up in her bed so she wouldn't bump into anything while we slept, she was as helpless as I was. I shared her lament. We wanted out and asap. 

A dreary feeling was all I could interpret in this very moment. Praying that whatever it was that was on its way wasn’t going to harm us. Heaven forbids the beast kill me and my family. No, no it can't, it wasn't real so it can't kill my family. 

I blinked again

A marching thunder had traced the bed in 2 seconds. The sound was that of footsteps stamping the carpet on the floor quickly. They were tap dancing foot beats, yet the owner of the footsteps was a tall shape.  I could make out the head.

It reminded me vaguely of the Jim Carrey grinch head shape. That thin head end, looking cone shape. The short hairs protruding from the edge of its face. I couldn't make out its eyes, but it was close enough to where it was obviously watching me. The tooth fairy isn't supposed to be caught mid act; else you gaze upon a strange mythical creature. One draped in beauty, mystique, and heartful. The contrasting concept was breathing harshness right in front of me. I didn't know what heavy breathing sounded like, I couldn't tell if it was my mothers breath as she slept or the beast. Both idle moved as if they were taking deep breaths but only one sound. It’s shoulders rose and slump, not struggling but almost like its resisting. What urge? What demand? Can a demon even desire something like me? Why would it…?

I thought I was schizophrenic when I was around the age of 15. I talked a lot to myself and just phrased it as “thinking out loud.” It wasn't until things would come and go around me as I went about my routines. Mostly at home and work, my mind was so occupied during school, and I had my friends to talk to. It only developed with time, things out of the corner of my eye became manifested thoughts. It's like daydreaming dialed up to 100. Being injected with a fervorous defect at birth, like I was, can be a corrosion to one's health. I wasn’t mentally ill, I just had an active imagination growing up. My understanding of life and fiction continued to rot my brain. I would think statues were watching me, that heads were turned to face me. Figures caught me in mirrors and glass only to not be there at all. My reflection gazed upon me only a fraction of a second earlier. 

I had a math class in high school near the beginning of the year. The class was massive in structure and space. The roof reached about 35 ft high. The space of the room was the same volume of ¼ a supermarket. That being said I had always gone absent minded during class. I never did pay attention because I had found the teachers way of engaging the class boring and hostile. In my absent mindedness, I started to hear what sounded like the hearing test. The hearing test we’re way back in my elementary school days, the black truck trailer with the equipment inside and it was a narrow space with human sized booths with seats along the side of the trailer. I remember the matted walls, black like tar. I remember my one particular experience where I went in myself and recall the red and blue headset that would correlate with the ear they went on. Left was blue, the red was right. Once on, we were sat in the booths with our legs out and a curtain to cover our top half and sight. This was to prevent the person sitting across from you peeking at you to see when to push the button they gave you to indicate you heard the beeping. It all started to distort after about the second beep. I started to hear whispers in my memory. Very subtle at first, telling me when to push. So human and kind I thought it was some assistant helping me along with the test. I thought everyone was hearing it, so I just continued along, naive that the voices in my headset were not for more than an audience of one. 

It started again. But this time more aggressive. A raspy, hushed snarl. Like when you're mouthing off to someone being too loud in a library.

""NOW.""  I pushed the button. Then a slight giggle. Everything it said was breathy, it was telling a secret.

""NOW."" I pushed again. A black boot briskly left my sight as I directed my eyes just below the curtain that covered me. I only remember the heels that the testers wore. I don’t remember boots.

""LOOK AWAY."" I choked on my voice as I shot my head up and forward. I instinctively hit the button again because I heard the voice and thought it meant to hit the button.

""NO, NOT THAT."" I heard it say I grinded my teeth knowing I had messed up.  I stopped all together just to listen. Not for the beeping now, but for the voice. It was gone. Caught up in the drastic exchange I didn’t notice the curtain was opened before me.

The tester had made the gesture to take off the headset and she spoke. “Hey Mijo, so it looks like you have to take the test again and you were part of the last group, I'm going to leave the curtain open for you since it’s going to be just you, okay? We are going to run the test again. Are you ready?”

I wanted to leave and come back another time. I wanted to tell her about the voices, but I had it in my head that I would get hurt if I spazzed out. So, I just nodded my head and she went up front to start the test. I sat in the booth; I looked down at the headset in my hands with my palms red from stress. I was gripping my hands in a panic so much they had turned redder than tomatoes. I tried to pat them against my thigh to ease them down.

I heard the tester say “Okay, you ready?”

I put on the headset and I said “Okay. Ready!” The test would typically last around 5 minutes for each group, ten if they thought the group needed extra evaluation. With that said I had felt the vibrations of footsteps exiting the trailer and out the door. I was alone in the trailer. 

The beeping started in my right ear first, so I began to count along with the length of the beep. 1, 2. 2 seconds. 2 second's right ear. Again in the left. 1,2. 2 seconds left ear. Now in both of my ears. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. 7 Seconds in both ears. Weird. I thought how strange it was that both were longer. From the last test each beep was the same length throughout the test. Maybe they had to be sure with me? Not sure. Again, right ear. 1,2,3. Stop. 1,2,3,4,5. Stop. 

""B L I N K.""

“What?” I asked as I did the action. The same boot that was caught under the curtain had now slipped its last bit into the booth next to me.

I stopped. Left ear. 1,2,3,4,5.

""S A M."" I blinked again, noticing another boot sliding into the booth to the left of me.

Now both. ""ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN.""

“Hello?” in a whispering voice I called out to whoever was counting now. “Hello? I'm here.” I said again, wondering if I could be saved from whatever was entrapping me.

The beep was played again. It sounded deafening, like it dug into my brain and was trying to claw its way out through my ears, then my eyes, then my forehead. A noise so piercing it felt like a parasite eating through me. Funny thing was I had taken off the headset when I called out.

""ONE."" A harsh, raspy voice said in my right ear. My neck almost whipped too fast for my head as I looked to the walls separating the booth to my right. My gaze trained on the carpet border between myself and the voice. In the darkness, I saw a figure reaching out to me from the space across from me just in my peripheral. I sucked in air like a vacuum and my eyelids were shot open.

""ONE."" It spoke.  Now from the left booth, I didn’t try to avert my gaze. It wasn’t as important as what I had thought was in front of me. ""ONE.""

“No! No!” I pleaded. It knew that if I didn’t look towards the voice, it could keep it up.

""ONE."" it was a repulsive seduction calling to me.

“I don’t want to!” fighting back all attempts to lure me in.

""SAM.""

I let up. I felt the need to peak out and to the let of the direction of the entrance. Towards the voice. The door to the trailer was shut and the only light illuminating was the computer desktop and the lightbulb just above it. The face had a smile very bright in the dark.

I reeled back into my booth and as soon as I did I heard the door open and shut again. CREAK, CREAK. “Okay, Mijo! We’re all done. Just sit still and I’ll come grab the headset.”

I felt sick. The tester came over and grabbed the headset. As she did, I heard her tell me “So it looks like you are having some hearing troubles, okay? We can’t run it a third time so we are going to send you home with a call to your mom and see what your doctor can do. Okay, Mijo?” 

“O-okay.” I replied. I got up and walked towards the front of the trailer slowly. The light from the doorway to outside now shining bright where I saw the crooked face in the dark. I looked intensely for the smile, or the eyes. Nothing. No shape, no form, no hint of it. I never like those hearing tests the same. From then on, I made sure to have an excuse to why I couldn’t. Ear infections, busy work. Anything to avoid the darkness of the trailer. And that smile in the dark.

I was lost in my memory, I had not thought about the booth for so long. So far apart had i wanted to rid myself of that incident but there I was, now tuned back into the math class many years later. That smile is still in my head. My attention now homed in on the lecture.

“Sam, can you tell me the formula I would use to solve this?” I looked up at the board and I realized I hadn’t written down anything of the notes the past 20 minutes.

“I don’t know, can I use the bathroom?”

“Dude, seriously?” he looked disappointed and annoyed.

I nodded and said, “It’s an emergency.” He pointed to the door, and I was out.

I walked through the hall and the clouds formed in the sky like a Bob Ross painting, a shadowy black with gray tufts crowding the light that would shine on the world. Finally making it to the bathroom, I noticed it was empty. I could take as long as I could catching my breath in here. I sat, clothes still on and all, on the toilet for a good 3 minutes or 4. I felt overwhelmed being lost in my recollection of the booth. I was hit with a minor panic attack, ailing me. It covered so much, it made focusing on anything impossible. I felt my vision shake, my heart pounding and my breathing was sharp. I felt my chest jumping as I inhaled and exhaled through my nose, a marathon runners' desperation to breathe had caught me as my nail's dugs into my pants. 

Then, with the force of a soldier forced to stand attention, I froze. I heard a beep in my ears. The frequency that the hearing tests would use. I had no earbuds, there were no speakers in the stall or the bathroom for that matter. But there it was, the same violence of the migraine trying to claw my skull. I felt nauseous and my vision worsened. I tried to stand but my legs were Jello and I almost fell to my knees. I braced myself and held myself up with the walls of the stall. I heaved and winced, in my effort to stabilize myself I attempted to unlatch the door to the stall but I couldn’t. My hands were shaking so much that you would think I had fish for fingers. I gave up and collapsed. My back pressed against one wall and my arms outstretched against it. I heard it again but only in my left ear. 1, 2. 2 seconds.

“Only 2 seconds, okay.” I said to myself. Although I was no longer by myself. No sound, no light from the outside, no sign of entry, I suddenly caught a pair of boots in the stall next to me. 

The bathrooms have automatic lights, if they don’t detect movement for some period of time they shut off to conserve power. I was unfortunate to find myself in that window of conservation, and the light in the bathroom, my saving grace, was snuffed out. Nothing more than pitch black darkness. It wasn’t break time, or passing period, so no one was expected to come in here for maybe another 40 minutes or so. I heard another beep playing in my right ear. 1,2. 2 seconds right ear. In my panic, I shot up and sat on the toilet seat again, trying my darndest to hide that I was in there. I sat my butt upwards on the seat and stretched my legs out on one of the walls of the stall. The beep played again. 1, 2, 3,

""FOUR, FIVE."" 

There it was, that harsh voice that demanded you acknowledge its authority. I shut my eyes, and covered my ears, hoping I can wait it out. I don’t know what I was waiting for, but it was better than that. 

""SAM.""

“No! Shut the fuck up!” I screamed. Fear overcame me. A wash of despair and uselessness filled my core to shake me like a blender. I was a pup stuck in a cage that had teeth. I was in the belly of a demon. I still heard footsteps of heavy worker boots through my hands on my ears. I was sweating, burning up, and feverish. I wanted out. I needed to get out.

""OPEN YOUR EYES."" It wanted me.

""OPEN YOUR EYES.""

It was fast and harsh still from all those years back. ""SAM.""

The beep now danced with the demon's voice as they both grew louder, like the devil himself calling me from hell. In a drastic moment of anger, my eyes shot open and stood up. I kicked the latch and the door opened. In the split second I saw it in the mirror, glaring at me. A hunter playing with its food. The eyes are bright and turquoise. The smile blended in with the darkness. No, it shaped the pitch black to gain form. The darkness was the demon, the smile was the void smiling at me. It twitched as if ready to open and show rows of blades in its mouth to devour me. I yelled and clenched a fist, I closed my eyes and lunged.

CRASH. My fist broke the mirror, connecting to the wall behind it. I released my breath through my teeth and stopped screaming. I heard the lights come on and I felt the warm and sharp pain in my hand. The blood trailing down to my forearm. “What are you doing!” my teachers voice rang. In my confusion, I opened my eyes and saw my teacher had just made his way into the bathroom.

“Stop staring, let's go to the nurse.” He looked to be in a mix of confused and annoyed. Like he was audible thinking to himself ‘The fuck is wrong with this kid?’ 

That week I was taken to a psychologist to be evaluated. I wasn’t diagnosed but I was given a ‘talk buddy’ to basically keep tabs on me. I was told the intent was to provide what I journal or diary couldn’t. Someone who would listen. I pleaded with the doctor and my mother that I would rather not, but my mother only seeing me as a shut-in decided, out of her own volition, that I needed to socialize more. I didn’t see this buddy in person often, it was mostly calls and texts to check, see what I did that day, how I was feeling, etc. We had decided to actually take time to see each other and meet up for a coffee. I agreed and the buddy seemed more than happy to. I had gotten his full name, Danny Porter, and he told me he was going to pull up in a black vans hoodie. I waited for him to come and once he did, I just stared at him.

“Hey Sam!” he called. Danny was a good man. He had helped me come to peace with some of my mental faults. He helped with some self confidence issues that I carried for a year or two. I really was so grateful for all he helped come to terms with. But it was always hard to look at him. I liked him more as just a voice, just an idea. It isn’t his own fault or his parent's fault that he had the same eyes and smile as a demon. 

I had eventually made it to my junior year of high school no problems except for the occasional anxiety of my future. I'm sure any teen has that headache of what their plans after graduation. Tests to ensure a good resume for any university, all the studying led to almost no free time at home and so I was bummed most of the time maintaining good sleep habits. After taking the S.A.TS, California assessment tests, or whatever college prep documents placed in front of me, I decided I had enough. If I can’t find my own free time to unwind and relax, I was going to make it myself.

My schedule looked like this; wake up at 6:40am to get ready, classes at  7am, lunch at 12pm, leave at 3p, homework until 6pm then dinner. I would be done with dinner at around 7pm and then I would shower to get ready to study and then bed.  It would be 8:30pm by the time I decided I was through studying and even then I felt tired by that time. But not this night.

This particular night I decided I would stay up later than usual and hop on my game console. I was obsessed with Destiny 2 and Monster Hunter at the time, both games that require a lot of grinding and a lot of material farming in order to progress in power and game content. Monster Hunter especially. I would play for 3 hours initially going to bed at around 11:30 to sometimes midnight. I had concluded that I felt perfectly fine after doing this routine for a week. Eventually pushing my limit staying up until 2am, 3:30am at the latest.

Again seeing little to no effect on my well being and I was content balancing out my routine with school time with me time. I was so dumb and naive. I curse myself thinking I should’ve known better. My mind was tricking my body the whole time Id run this routine, telling it that the very little sleep was sufficient when it wasn’t near the right amount of sleep. One night is when my body shut down. It was about 9pm, maybe 10pm but it was dark out for certain.

To give extra context, my room was a decent size, the window up to my chest leading out to the backyard, nothing more but screen mesh and curtains dividing me and the outside. I had my bed next to the window against the corner of the room and my nightstand next to my bed. I had actually been resting around this time. Feeling fatigued, I made the conscious choice to just call it in earlier than usual. So much so that I actually almost fell asleep with the light on…almost. I felt my eyes grow heavy when a sudden screech of a banshee put me in a stasis. It was distant and slightly faint. It came from my window. The curtains almost fully covering the window now felt like a shielding from a horror. A ghastly feeling took over me, the scream was coming from the mountains near the house. We lived near the foothills, less than a 10-minute walk away.

The scream sounded like a womans, she was in pain or in fear. It was the dying cries of a woman. I didn’t know if it was my mind or if there was actually a woman crying out for hell but I knew it would be too late if I even bothered to get involved. So I just shut the window over the mesh, turned off the lights, and went to bed.  That scream was on replay for the time I was trying to sleep. It was 1:00am by the time I fell asleep and woke up not too long after at 3:40am. I was stuck. My body unable to move, my arms at my side and the covers acting more as a restraint than simply covers. Before I had gone to sleep I remember I had turned on my led lights I'd set up 2 days before. I would choose before sleep a blue color or a red. That night I chose red and tuned the brightness down. just a tad so it wasn’t lighting up my face like a tomato. The rest of my room was illuminated crimson. The rest of the room being my tv and my dresser facing opposite of me in bed. The dresser was a normal 6 drawer dresser with a mirror attached to the top half of it. My vision still red from the lights lighting the room like a velvet filter. The red that would usually tuck me away to sleep now was showing me something that I pray everyday is no longer barred to me. 

 

Catholics and Mexican culture mesh like peanut butter and jelly when it comes to superstition. Tales of old warnings of omens and gateways for demons to enter our lives. Wives tales from Mexico that guided some ,who were so spiritual, on how to live life. Salt over the shoulder, pray before sleep, and don’t have mirrors in your room. In my state of sleepless nights, I had developed an overactive imagination. At least thats how I came to terms with it. I had been stuck at an angle in my sleep, my head tilted slightly to where I can barely catch the mirror. From there I tried to make out the reflection of myself in bed. The mirror wasn’t reflecting me. Instead, it was black. Like an abyss. From the abyss…came devils.  

A shadowy hand started to crawl it’s way out from behind the mirror. It looked like a claw. I couldn't make out details but they were elongated. I could make out claws but that was it. Was it scaley? Wet? Maybe even…fleshy? I don't know. It stretched for a second before I saw a head make its way out from behind the mirror after the hand. Then another arm. The shadowy figure was crawling out from the mirror and the mirror was still an abyss. And I was helplessly frozen. This demon figure had made it’s way  from the dark pit of the Devil’s playground into my room. It kept crawling upwards toward my ceiling and as it did, the led lights were blinking rapidly. I had done the motion and felt my eyelids close but I still saw everything. Thats probably the biggest downside to sleep paralysis, you can shut your eyes, breath and plead with every ounce of your body. Try as you may, it’s all in your head. My brain was putting it in my sight that it knew the demon was still there and making its way towards me. It reminded me of the witch from Left from Dead 2 the way it looked so malnourished and that long hair draping its face like a mask. It crawled onto the wall adjacent to my bed and in moments was latched onto the wall, inches away from my face. I was a fly caught in a spider web facing down my captor. I had forced my body to muster up some energy to barely tilt my head towards the wall to try and wake myself up. The demon did not like that. In a black flash it shot forward in front of my eyes again and swung its claw at my face. 

My eyes shot open. I felt my lungs begging for air like an addict. My whole chest, a jackhammer ringing loudly. My heart was pounding erratically so much it felt like my ribs were going to fracture. It was cold, and I felt my eyes were dry. My whole body was shaking in terror. I learned my lesson that day. A harsh lesson. To this day I have my L.E.DS disconnected and from time to time debated on cutting the mirror half of the dresser. I keep a line of salt lining the bottom and the top of the mirror thinking that would be enough. I still find myself spacing out during the day staring into my reflection. It took me some time to stare into my reflection at night out of fear but I had done it later on. It was just a normal night unlike the one night where the demonic event transpired. Thinking this night was nothing special I decided to test my theory the one and only time. I closed the curtains and turned off any and all lights in the room. I had stood at the mirror for ten minutes and then it happened. In the darkness I had seen the turquoise eyes and the void smile of dark perversion. It wasn’t next to me but instead looked to be where my nightstand was. I took my phones flashlight and shined it on the space where the eyes were. Nothing. I looked back toward the mirror and it was still there. In a final test I turned off the flashlight but kept the camera flash on. I took a picture. I wish I hadn’t There in the capture I saw it all in the mirror. The turquoise eyed evil on the left side of the bed. The Mirror demon on the wall to the right. The salt was useless.

They were already in the house.

I have had these episodes of hysterics and hallucinations documented and reported to my psychologist. I was evaluated again not too long ago and the results came back. I wasn’t diagnosed with schizophrenia but with a form of ADHD or minor fluid discharge in the brain. I was told I was a unique case, the serotonin in my system would have an overflow in my blood and my body, in response to the overflow, would discharge only the filled portions into my gut and then it would find its way to my brain. Some science shit like that or something.  I wasn’t 100% paying attention but all I got from that was the prescription for medicine that would regulate the amount produced, like mood stabilizers. After a year of taking the meds, I saw the effects taking place and less and less of ‘Demons.’ I was grateful.

I could sleep. I could think. And regardless of the stoic face I had most of the time, sometimes barely able to be overexpressed with excitement, I was glad I could lead my life from here on out. I was getting ready for bed one night and I had just showered and gotten dressed. I was over the sink brushing my teeth and then rinsed. I looked over the prescription meds and popped the cap. I took the regulated 2 capsules for the night and downed it with some of the faucet water. As soon as I reeled up to the mirror, I saw my eyes. They were turquoise. A cold dagger of a chill ran down my back and I gripped the sink counter like a vice. “What the fu-” I was cut off. The lights in the bathroom went out and I was in the darkness facing the mirror. My eyes were back to the normal and I felt only a split-second relief and then fear struck again. My eyes were normal…but the eyes behind me were turquoise…

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Mazatlán vs. Puebla: A Clash of Chutzpah and Chutzpah (With a Side of Math)**  
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Liga MX showdown that’s as statistically convoluted as a tangle of Christmas lights. On July 18th, Mazatlán FC (10th place, 1 point) and Puebla (13th place, 0 points) will battle at Estadio El Encanto, where the air will be thick with tension, the scent of hot dogs, and the faint echo of Puebla’s last home loss. Let’s parse this like a spreadsheet on Red Bull.

---

### Parse the Odds: The Math of Desperation

The odds tell a tale of two teams: Mazatlán (-220) is the slight favorite, while Puebla (+350) is the underdog, and the draw (+320) is the “safe bet” for those who hate decisive outcomes. Converting decimal odds to implied probabilities (because math is the spice of life):

* **Mazatlán’s win**: \~45-48% (odds range from 2.1 to 2.23).
* **Puebla’s win**: \~28-33% (odds range from 3.0 to 3.56).
* **Draw**: \~30-31% (3.2-3.35).

The total implied probability? A bloated 100.5-105%, thanks to bookmaker vigorish. But the key takeaway is clear: this is a low-scoring, high-drama affair. The under 2.5 goals is favored (-200 to -183), suggesting bettors expect a defensive duel. If you’re betting on chaos, the over 2.5 goals is a long shot (+200 to +210), like betting on a snowstorm in the Sahara.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Referees, and the Ghost of Last Season

Puebla enters this match with the enthusiasm of a man who just remembered he’s out of coffee. Their last game? A home loss. Their offense? As prolific as a sieve full of sand. Meanwhile, Mazatlán’s 0-0 draw last time out proves they’ve mastered the art of “not losing,” a skill as valuable as a waterproof phone case in a monsoon.

I’m working on a medieval world that discovered Einstein’s relativity, but for magic.

Magic isn’t some rare, mysterious force for the gifted elite. It’s as common and everyday as electricity and the internet. Everyone taps into it, powers their homes and even brews coffee with magic tech.

Does that still count as fantasy?

* Magic isn’t locked behind ancient tomes or royal bloodlines.
* Politics revolve around if we should drill for more magic crystals, or use... sunlight?
* Wizards become arcane scientists developing spell tech and magical propulsion.

Btw, I'm not talking Arcane level common magic. But fully integrated to the most basic human activity. I have tried to create another source of mystery through characters, but since the magic system has no mystery left, there's a lack of wonder. Maybe it's just me.

Would you still call such world a fantasy or even want to live in it?

1m2t9mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m2t9mm/the_rabbit_box/,The Rabbit Box,"When I was six years old, my mother sent me to stay with my grandparents for the summer. 

At this time in my life, I had never met my mother's parents, and I had never been away from home longer than a weekend. When my mom broke the news to me that I would be going away for nearly two months, I sobbed on and off for several days. It wasn't until she told me that my grandparents had a dog that I began to feel some excitement about leaving home. 

Kindergarten was ending, and on the last day, I joined the class on the rainbow-colored carpet where we were prompted by our teacher, Ms. Hayne, to share something we had planned for summer break. Ms. Hayne was a young teacher, in her second or third year at the school whose voice was sweet and soft. When it was my turn to share, I proudly exclaimed that I would be spending the summer at my grandparents’s house. I made sure to mention the dog. My peers giggled and shouted at the mention of the animal, and that helped me to adjust to the idea of leaving even more. 

It felt like some sort of adventure. Still, the day came, and I trembled with nerves in the back seat of my mom’s Honda as she drove me several hours away from home and toward the unknown. The road seemed to be unending, and the wide city street eventually narrowed into a poorly maintained stretch of asphalt that dug deep into a wooded mountain. 

“Where are the other cars?” I asked my mother as I peered around checking each window. “Not many people come up this way. Grandma and Grandpa like their privacy, so they moved up here back before you were born.” Sensing my uneasiness she added, “Dont worry honey. You are going to have so much space to run around and explore. It's going to be a good change of pace for you.” I shuffled in my seat and fell quiet. I did like the idea of exploring outside. My mom and I lived on the second floor of an old apartment building. There were some neighbor kids with whom I spent most of my free time, but finding something to do other than coloring or building Legos was difficult since none of us were allowed to play outside. Too many strangers and moving cars. 

It wasn't the worst neighborhood, but it wasn't the kind of place where you let your kids roam free. There was always an adult watching us when we would venture out to play on the basketball court, where we would usually just end up playing freeze tag. That ten-by-twenty cement pad contained the majority of my outdoor experience. It would be nice to have some freedom to run wild, catch bugs, and climb trees. 

The road trailed on and the foliage seemed to grow all-encompassing, almost swallowing the small road in some areas. As branches stretched over the skies the shadows paved the street in shapes all too frightening for a child with an active imagination. I chose to keep my view centered on the seat in front of me. We drove all day, and when the sun had set we finally pulled onto a dirt road. We continued for at least another mile before a large house came into view behind the trees. 

As we slowly inched the car closer the fauna opened up into a clearing, and the whole property was visible. Near the main house was a barn that looked as though it used to be painted red, but was now chipped away revealing mostly brown and white wood. As we rounded the house to the back where my mom parked the car a small shed appeared. 

“Alright. We’re here!” my mom shouted with more relief than enthusiasm. I kept my seat belt on, hoping that if I waited long enough my mother would decide this whole thing had been a mistake and turn the car around. Instead, she removed her keys, killing the radio that was softly humming static, and opened her door. I followed my mom's lead, not wanting to remain alone in the car. Stepping out of the vehicle I was hit with a light gust of wind that chilled my small bones and made me grimace. I looked at my mom, and she could see how tense I was. 

Grabbing my hand she led me around to the side door and knocked. I clutched her hand in mine as we waited for the door to swing open. After a moment, creaking footsteps approached, and the hinges of the door squeaked to reveal a tender aged face. My grandmother stood in the doorway with a soft smile and warm eyes ushering us in with her free hand, the other clutching a plate of cookies. “Come in!” she squealed. 

I looked at my mother who wore the same soft smile on her own face. We walked in and the door was shut behind us. The warmth my grandmother exuded did a decent job of melting my fears, but the atmosphere of the home was quick to send the chills back down my spine. All of the lights were off. Only the moonlight shining in through the entryway window illuminated my surroundings. “Oh excuse me one moment.” my grandmother said as she placed the tray of cookies on the coffee table and rushed to turn on a lamp. 

When the small, solitary light source was flipped on the house was left looking eerie. My mom began catching up with my grandma. The two had talked over the phone several times over the years, but this was the first time they had been in the same room since I was born. They sat on the couch as my mom complained about the drive and my grandmother tried to force-feed her oatmeal raisin cookies. Noticing my shyness my mom excused me to explore the house. “Your room is upstairs to the right,” Grandma said. I picked up my bag, slung it over my shoulders, and headed towards the staircase. As I ascended I made sure to count each stair, a habit that I have yet to break even in my adulthood. I reached the top. 

14 steps. 

I glanced to my right, seeing that the hallway led to a small bedroom and a bathroom adjacent to it. I peered to the left out of curiosity and let out an involuntary scream. Down the left hallway was my grandfather, a man wholly unfamiliar to me, standing in the doorway. His silhouette was outlined by the shining light behind him, creating a specter in my young imagination. 

My mother rushed up the stairs when she heard me and frantically asked what was wrong. Frozen in fear, I stammered for the words. “Th..the…man…” I pointed down the hall. Grandpa had turned his back and began walking into the master bedroom, shutting the door behind him without a word. “Oh don't you mind him,” Grandma said as she reached the 14th step. “He's been feeling under the weather. He hopes to make an appearance tomorrow after he's gotten some rest.” “Well, I plan on leaving kind of early tomorrow. I have to get back for some meetings at work.” Mom said. “Trust me,” Grandma replied, “No one gets up earlier than Grandpa.”

The next morning I got up early to say goodbye to my mom. Up until this point I had been the only one with visible hesitation, but she seemed to linger longer than expected, looking into my eyes and showering me with kisses and I-love-yous. I wish I could have stayed in that moment forever. True to my grandmother’s words, my grandfather had gotten up before anyone but chose to spend the morning hunting. This was irritating to my mother, but she really did have responsibilities at work to return to, so she eventually got into the driver’s seat of her car and rounded the house heading for the main road. 

I waved goodbye and watched her car until it dipped past the clearing and was absorbed by the tree line. With the vehicle out of sight, my fate was sealed. I would be spending almost two full months in this foreign place. “Come on inside. We can have some breakfast together.” said my grandmother. 

The rest of the morning was fairly normal. I ate eggs and bacon, colored a picture, and even got to spend some time watching cartoons on the old TV in the living room. It was the kind that had the antennas at the top, and I didn't get any of the normal channels but I eventually found an animated show and sat back to enjoy the story. That morning I had also gotten to know grandma’s dog Buffalo, who had gotten used to my presence and was lying next to me on the couch. 

Everything changed when my grandfather returned home from hunting. Though I was in the living room, I immediately tuned in to his arrival as he threw the front door open and yelled out to my grandma. I stayed seated on the couch, but I could hear her greeting him at the door. Her demeanor was drastically different from then on. Instead of the bubbly, cheerful woman I had met the night before, she became a fearful shell when he was around. 

Grandpa mumbled something about having lunch ready by the time he returned from the basement. Dragging two lifeless rabbits at his side, my grandfather walked to the basement door and stopped. He turned to me and said, “Dont you go snooping around my basement, you hear me, kid?” I nodded, and he descended the stairs closing the door behind him. “What's in the basement?” I asked turning to Grandma. “That's where your grandpa does his work. He sells the rabbit meat and skins, and he uses the downstairs area to clean and prepare them.” 

I didn't like the idea of dead rabbits in the house. In my innocent mind, I could only feel sadness for the creatures, and even a little fear. I had never seen a dead thing before. A curiosity about the rabbits started to grow within me. Not the blood and guts part. I wasn't old enough to understand that. But the idea of something being alive and then just…well…not being alive anymore was sort of fascinating in a morbid way. I knew then that I had to get a closer look at the rabbits. I wish that I hadn't. Maybe if I had followed the rules and stayed out of that basement, none of this would have happened to me.

A few days passed, and the routine became clear. Every morning, Grandpa would go rabbit hunting. And every day a little after breakfast he would return home with 2 to 5 rabbits strung up by their legs. I remember that, even as a child, it was odd to me that I never saw any meat or skins returning with Grandfather when he would come back upstairs. Wasn't he selling them? They surely can't just still be sitting in the basement…could they? It was hard to come to any conclusions, especially because Grandpa hardly ever talked to me or even acknowledged my existence. 

Grandmother was silent. I quickly became aware that the happy talkative personality I had seen when we first arrived had been a facade, hiding the real grandma. In reality, she was timid, quiet, and kept to herself most days. She only really spoke to me about when a meal was prepared, or when it was time to go to sleep. Other than those times, she stayed in her room. I was too young to realize that I was being neglected, but I understood that something about this situation was wrong. 

Left to fend for myself most of the day, I spent my time exploring the woods with Buffalo. He was a good dog and stayed close to me even without a leash. Though he was a coward most of the time, he seemed to be very protective of me and would often jump in front of me to warn me of ledges, streams, or animal dens. I grew to love that dog. One day while I was at the edge of the tree line about to go exploring I noticed my grandfather getting into his truck and driving off the property. I was about to continue on my expedition when a thought crossed my mind. 

This is the perfect time to see the rabbits in the basement. 

With my grandpa out of the house, I figured I could sneak downstairs, take a quick peek, and be back upstairs before anyone noticed. Grandmother would be in her room until dinner time, and even without knowing where Grandfather went, I estimated I had at least a few minutes. Maybe more. I turned back and headed inside. Once inside I did a brief check to make sure my grandmother wasn't wandering about. Just as I thought she would be, she was shut up in her bedroom. 

It was almost too perfect. I stepped over to the basement door, making sure to tiptoe in case my footsteps alerted her. When I reached the door I was surprised to find it unlocked. They were making this too easy. I opened the door slowly, attempting to minimize the creaking that all the house doors emitted. Looking down the steps, I took in the darkness. “Stay here boy,” I said to Buffalo. If there was raw rabbit meat down there, I didn't want him getting into it and blowing my cover. 

I began my slow descent, counting the stairs. Reaching the bottom, I muttered, 

“12”, 

under my breath. I looked around for a light switch and had to feel the walls with my hands until I found what I was looking for and flicked it up. The small bulb illuminated the room in a dim yellow shade. I was starting to feel a little creeped out, and for a second thought to turn back, until I noticed a door on the other side of the room. I figured that must be where Grandpa kept the rabbit remains. 

Inching forward I reached out for the handle, but before I could turn the knob I was caught off guard by a loud booming voice. “So!” my Grandfather shouted from behind me. “You want to see what I keep in the old storage closet do ya kid?” I quickly turned to face him, my blood running cold. He had a smile on his face, but he didn't seem to be happy at all. There was malice in his eyes. 

“I'm sorry Grandpa I'll go back upstairs,” I said timidly. He shook his head. “No. You want to see what's inside. And I want to show you.” Fear froze me in my tracks. I couldn't say anything as he walked closer and reached out for the handle to the door. When he opened it a feeling of uneasy confusion washed over me. It was a closet, about 3 feet in width and 4 feet in length. The only thing inside was a wooden chest. It was dark brown and had a large round lock on it. 

The chest was big, taking up most of the space in the closet. I didn't understand what he was trying to show me. Grandpa fished into his pocket and pulled out a key. “Let's take a look inside, shall we?” He said. I was still frozen in place. I no longer wanted to see what was inside, but I hoped he would open it quickly so we could get the ordeal over with and move on to my inevitable punishment. Kneeling down, he unlocked the chest and motioned for me to open it. Hesitantly, I grabbed the edges of the lid and lifted the top. 

Before I had a chance to recognize the contents of the box I was grabbed from behind. Kicking and screaming I begged to be let go, but I was too small and weak to fight against him. He shoved me forcefully into the chest and slammed the lid shut. I continued to scream, and from outside the box, I could hear the old man howling with laughter. “Maybe this will teach you not to go snooping in other people's business!” he bellowed. I pushed up on the top of the box but it didn't budge. The monster had locked it. 

Through my tears, I listened as his footsteps walked away. I heard him climb the stairs and shut the basement door as he exited. After a few more moments of crying, I assessed the contents of the chest. It was too dark to see clearly. The chest had small, almost unnoticeable gaps along the seams in the edges, and being in a closet there wasn't much light available to seep through. 

When put into dark spaces the pupils dilate in order to capture as many photons as possible. It takes time, but as long as there is a small trace of light, the eyes will adjust to it to the best of their abilities. When my young eyes eventually captured the small hint of visibility I was afforded within the box, I began to scream again. With me in the old wooden chest were the remains of a half dozen or so rabbits. Soft fur mixed with sticky congealed blood hugged me from every angle. 

I am not sure how long I was left in the box. It must have been hours because eventually when my grandfather returned to let me out the sky was dark and it was time for bed. Everything changed after that night. I was still afforded the liberty of roaming the house and forest during the day, but at night I was always led downstairs, where my grandfather would put me in the box, and I would spend the night there. 

In the mornings when he would go hunting, he would let me out and take me hunting with him. My job was the carry the rabbits after he had shot them. After breakfast, he would show me how to remove the bones. These were his real trophies. With twine and sticks, he would bind them together to form symbols. Sigils of sorts I guess. He was always vague about what they were meant for, but he believed they held the power to ward off evil. The kind of evil was never specified. 

After crafting the symbols we would walk around the forest and hang them on trees. The bloodied coats were placed into the chest. He claimed they held special importance as well, but never told me what he did with them. When the chest was filled with nine skins he would take them out to his truck and drive away with them. Maybe he was selling them, but the way he talked about them made it seem as though they held sacred powers as well. I guess I'll never know for sure what he did with them. Eventually, the summer ended, and I went back to live with my mother once more. I never saw either of my grandparents again. 

That brings me to why I am writing this. Many years have passed since that summer at the farm. I buried my trauma, and despite all odds, I've actually grown up to be pretty successful. I'm a social worker who specializes in neglected children’s cases. I live a humble, quiet life, and it suits me. 

But the other day, out of the blue, I received a call from an executor of my grandfather’s will. I guess the old man finally kicked the bucket. Apparently, he had left me something, too. I was hesitant to accept a meeting with the representative at first. I didn't really need or want the man’s money, or whatever he left me. But I decided to go anyway, at least to placate my curiosity. 

We met in a law building filled to the brim with men and women in suits looking far too busy. My job has its own fair share of hustle, paperwork, and long days, so I could sympathize with the people milling about me. The conference room was on the second floor. I scaled to the top and paused.

12 stairs.

When we entered the conference room I was asked to sit down, look over a few papers, and sign them. Skimming the documents I grew confused and asked for clarification about the itemized inheritance. Under my name, there was a number one. “Excuse me, what does this one next to my name mean?” I asked. “That's the amount of items left for you specifically by your grandfather in the will.” the representative explained. “So…what is it? What did he leave me?” 

He turned to the closet in the conference room and fished out a key from his pocket. When he opened the door, lying on the floor was a large, dark brown, wooden chest.

I never knew his age but i thought he was freshly out of highschool. he never knew my age either and people usually think im 18-20. anyways this past month things have progressed and we've gotten closer and closer. here's the specific things that have happened for me to think this:

- we have a few inside jokes. and that's not the reason, it's just that we're both comfortable enough to have them. he frequently references them and we laugh about it. i do too, one of them is how someone donated a Pikachu butt pl*g (idk if that's allowed to say..?) but i was walking into work and everyday we say hi and we talk and i had a bag of jackets to donate and when i came in he said ""oh it's you"" in a bantering tone. i held up the bag and said ""this is my butt pl*gs. just kidding they're jackets"" and obviously you can't just say that but he thought it was funny so we're comfortable with eachother.
-hes really interested in what im interested in. i do this chalk event every year and three times he brought it up and asked to see pictures 
-whenever i go to the back either on break to talk with other coworkers or to put racks away he comes over to talk to me. today i went to grab my coffee and he followed me to keep talking to me. 
-the topic of him and i being young came up with my other coworkers and then Jake asked how old i was. i said 16 and then i asked him how old he was. he said 21 (he just turned 22) but after the other coworkers left he brought up my age again. he said he just turned 22 and then he asked if im turning 17 soon. and i am so i clarified that. it's just when that second conversation happened he was really thinking about something. it confused me because why and what would he be thinking so intently about 
-we were talking about weird customers and he said: a month ago this man came around to pick up furniture (the cashiers write slips and the customers bring them to the back so they can help them load their furniture into their car) and the guy had a thick accent so i couldn't understand what he said when i asked to spell his name i already knew i messed it up. so i completely botched his name. but the guy said to Jake (they were speaking Spanish) ""the cashier spelled my name completely wrong. but that's okay because she was a hot chick."" and Jake told me this as he was moving boxes and he was laughing with me about it. it's just why did he tell me this now and why did he emphasize ""hot chick"" (maybe that's how the guy said it but idk)
-his mom is super controlling and calls a lot to make him call her. she called me and told me that he NEEDS to call her back for something important (even though they just talked). but i went to him and he was done with his shift so he was on his switch and i said his name and was joking around about his mom, kinda dragging the words around and teasing about how dramatic she is. the thing is he was like lost in my face almost? I've never seen that smile on him before. like it was a genuine small smile and i could tell it was not a controlled expression it was just his reaction to me. but it kinda made me get butterflies from because he looked so again lost in my face.

That wedding dress wasn’t mine. Those guests weren’t mine. That gold ring that would be placed on my finger wasn’t mine. That groom at the altar wasn’t mine.

When I entered the church and all eyes turned to me, it felt like a silent accusation. They knew that the ceremony was theater.

My heart was beating fast, and my head was spinning, telling me to get out of there. For a minute, I looked at the door behind me, but it only took Dad’s hard stare to make me take the first step.

“Come on, Laura, you can do it,” I muttered to myself.

As I approached the altar, he was there. James, wearing his expensive dark suit, his hair gelled and his face impatiently.

I smiled under my veil, trying to disguise my nervousness, but he didn’t even look in my direction.

While the priest was giving a beautiful sermon about the wedding, I could see how irritated he was. James put the ring on my finger with such force that I let out a groan of pain.

By the time the priest said, “I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.”

He left the church without looking back, leaving me alone at the altar.

“Enjoy the party,” he shouted from the doorway.

The whispers started as a low hum and grew until they echoed throughout the church. I felt my face burn under the veil as I stood paralyzed at the altar, the bouquet trembling in my hands, and an overwhelming desire to cry.

“Laura, congratulations on the wedding,” someone said.

I couldn’t reply.

The air left my lungs as if I had been punched. My legs went weak, and I had to lean on the altar to keep from falling.

The bouquet slipped from my numb fingers and fell to the floor with a dull thud. Every word the guests said was like a new stab in my chest. I looked at my father, silently begging him to help me. But his face was pale, his eyes shifted to the floor.

“Laura...” someone said next to me, but I was already running.

I crossed the church aisle like a white blur, tripping over the dress that wasn’t mine, tearing off the veil that was stifling my sobs. The guests stood up in their places, but no one tried to stop me.

My trembling hands pushed open the church door, but at that moment a powerful hand grabbed my arm, its fingers digging into my skin like claws. The grip was familiar - my father always knew exactly how much force to use to hurt without leaving marks on my skin.

“Laura, don’t embarrass the family,” he hissed close to my ear, his voice calm but laden with menace. “Let’s go to the party. There’s a big celebration waiting for us.”

“What’s there to celebrate?”

The drive to the ballroom was a silent torture in the back of the limousine. My stepmother Eva kept complaining about how I had “ruined” the perfect ceremony she had planned. Her words mingled with the noise of the engine, turning into an irritating hum as I watched the city pass by the window, feeling like a prisoner on her way to her sentence.

“You need to smile,” my father ordered, his eyes meeting mine.

There was no warmth in his words, just the coldness of a business executive closing yet another deal.

Eva shifted in her seat. She displayed a fake concern on her face.

“The wedding day is the happiest day in a woman’s life,” she declared in that sugary voice she always used in public. “All the magazines say so.”

I felt a solitary tear run down my cheek as I looked at my hands, the wedding ring shining like a golden handcuff.

“Then why do I feel so sad?”

“You’ve always been dramatic,” Eva replied with an exasperated sigh, exchanging a complicated glance with my father. “Just like your mother.”

The mention of my mother was like a slap, but I swallowed the words I wanted to say. After all, that’s what they expected of me - to swallow the pain, smile and pretend that this really was the happiest day of my life.

“You married one of the richest men in the country; you should be happy,” my father argued.

“I don’t care about money. I wanted to marry for love,” I mumbled.

I arrived at the party, and everything was very luxurious.

Crystal lights reflected off the polished marble, creating an ethereal atmosphere in the hall. Silver candlesticks adorned the tables covered with champagne silk tablecloths, while elaborate arrangements of white orchids perfumed the room.

“Where’s James?” one guest whispered to another as I walked past.

I tried to keep my smile as I walked between the tables, feeling the looks of pity and curiosity following me. The bridal waltz began to play, but there was no one to dance with me.

“Laura, darling,” James’ mother approached, her smile as fake as the pearls around my neck. “James had an emergency at work. You understand, don’t you? He’s a very busy man.”

“Of course, Mrs. Reynolds,” I replied mechanically.

The five-tiered cake remained untouched, a masterpiece in shades of ivory and gold that no one dared to cut. The champagne glasses were filled and emptied quickly, as if the guests were trying to drown their embarrassment.

“This is unacceptable,” I heard my father mutter to Eva. “He won’t even take my calls.”

“Laura,” my cousin Alice approached, her eyes full of genuine concern. “You don’t have to stay here.”

“Yes, I do,” I whispered, looking at the empty seat next to me at the head table. “This is my punishment, isn’t it?”

“I told you to run away, too.”

A server passed by, offering more champagne. I took a glass and drank it in one gulp, feeling the bubbly liquid burn my throat along with the tears I refused to shed.

“Let’s make a toast to the bride and groom!” someone shouted, clearly drunk.

The silence that followed was deafening.

“Smile, Laura,” Eva whispered, squeezing my shoulder. “The photographers are still here.”

The orchestra continued playing romantic songs to a room where love was conspicuously absent, as was the groom.

After saying goodbye to the last guest, I went to the bedroom and, to my surprise, my husband was there. Sitting in a leather armchair, a document in his hands and an expression of utter contempt on his face.

“Are you in here?” I asked nervously.

“This is my room.”

I looked around, and everything was as cold as the man in front of me. His blue eyes were like icebergs in the northern seas.

“Let me make the terms very clear,” he said, his voice as sharp as ice. “First, you’re not my real wife. This is a business arrangement.”

I stood, still wearing the wedding dress that wasn’t mine, while he leafed through the contract.

“Second, you will sleep in the guest room at the end of the corridor. Or on the floor, if you prefer. I don’t mind.”

“I’m not quitting my job,” I declared, surprising us both with the firmness in my voice.

James looked up from the document, a cruel smile forming on his lips. “Oh, yes, you are. A wife from the Reynolds family doesn’t work in just any bookshop.”

“You can’t make me.”

“I can and I will,” he stood up, approaching like a predator. “Or have you forgotten the deal your father made? The debt he owes me? All it takes is one phone call from me to the lawyers, and your father will spend the rest of his life in jail.”

I felt my eyes sting with restrained tears. “But I like my job.”

“Too bad.”

“What else is in this contract?”

“Public appearances when necessary. Family dinners on Sundays. Smiles at social events,” he listed coldly. “And, of course, absolute secrecy about the nature of our arrangement.”

“For how long?”

“Until I decide it’s over.” James threw the contract on the bed. “Sign the last page. And Laura...” he paused in the doorway, “don’t kid yourself that this will ever change. My heart belongs to someone else.”

I picked up the pen with trembling fingers, each word of the contract weighing like lead in my chest.

He looked at me for a few seconds. “Laura, don’t ever wear fake jewelry again; that’s ridiculous.”

I touched my necklace in shame.

“Welcome to hell, Ms. Reynolds,” he said before leaving, leaving me alone with my new reality.

I let my body collapse onto the bed and cried.

# Chapter 2: The Morning After

The next morning, the breakfast room of the Reynolds mansion was a masterpiece in shades of cream and gold. The morning light streamed through the French windows, making the fine china sparkle on the impeccably set table.

“Good morning, dear daughter-in-law,” Mrs. Reynolds said as I entered, her voice too sweet to be sincere. “I hope you slept well in the guest room.”

I blushed as I realized that she knew exactly where I had spent the night. I think everyone did.

“Coffee’s served, ma’am,” the housekeeper announced, placing a tray of freshly baked croissants on the table.

James was already there, hiding behind the financial newspaper, with his untouched black coffee in front of him. He didn’t even raise his eyes when I sat down.

“Laura, darling, you need to eat more,” Catherine Reynolds said, pushing a plate of eggs benedict towards me. “You’re too thin. What will people think? That you’re sick.”

“That she doesn’t live up to the Reynolds’ name, as usual,” Margaret, James’ sister, entered the room, her heels tapping on the marble floor. “Good morning, little brother.”

James finally put down the paper to smile at his sister. It was the first genuine smile I’d seen him give since the wedding.

“The coffee’s cold,” he said dryly to the housekeeper, ignoring my presence. “Bring another.”

“So, Laura,” Margaret leaned over the table, her eyes twinkling with mischief, “have you got used to your new position yet? It must be quite an adjustment, considering your origins.”

Before I could reply, James intervened.

“Laura knows exactly where you stand in this house, don’t you, dear?”

The tone of his voice made my stomach turn. I nodded silently, staring at the untouched cup of tea in front of me.

“Oh, I almost forgot.” Mrs. Catherine pulled a gold envelope from her purse. “Charity ball on Friday. Laura, dear, I’ll send my personal seamstress over this afternoon. We need to make sure you’re…presentable.”

“That won’t be necessary,” James folded the newspaper methodically. “Laura has other commitments.”

“But son…”

“I said no.” He stood, straightening his jacket. “Excuse me, I have an important meeting.”

When he left, the silence hung over the table like a toxic cloud. I could feel the two women’s eyes assessing me, judging me, as the croissants cooled, untouched, like my appetite for the life that was now mine.

“The driver is waiting, James,” Mrs. Reynolds said softly.

“I don’t need a driver, Mom. Laura will drive me,” James declared, making everyone at the table freeze.

“Me?” I asked, surprised at the first time he had given me a direct task.

“Yes. Since you insist on working, you can start by being useful. Be my personal chauffeur,” he smiled coldly. “After all, I can’t have my wife working at some random bookstore, but driving for me… that’s acceptable, don’t you think?”

Margaret let out a mocking laugh as I felt my face heat up.

“James, dear, are you sure?” her mother asked, clearly uncomfortable.

“Absolutely.” He tossed the Audi keys in my direction. “Don’t keep me waiting, Laura.”

On shaky legs, I stood up from the table. Mrs. Reynolds sighed heavily.

“Laura,” she called as I stood at the door. “Remember: you’re a Reynolds now. Even if… well, even under the current circumstances.”

In the hallway, James was waiting for me with an expression of pure disdain.

“Rule number one: don’t talk to me during the ride. Rule number two: keep an appropriate distance from other drivers. And rule number three,” he leaned closer, his expensive cologne invading my senses, “don’t you dare think of this as an opportunity to bond. It’s a punishment.”

“Why are you doing this?” I whispered.

“Because I can,” he replied simply. “And because I want you to understand exactly where you belong in this family.”

The sound of our footsteps echoed down the marble hallway, each click of my heels reminding me that this was just another of the many humiliations to come.

“You have twenty minutes.”

The Audi’s plush interior was a stark contrast to the ice that had settled between us. I kept my eyes fixed on the road, remembering the first rule: no talking during the ride. Each red light seemed to last forever.

James sighed in irritation every time I slowed down, but I remained silent. The sound of his fingers on his cell phone was the only soundtrack to that tense morning.

“Incompetent,” he muttered as I stopped at yet another traffic light.

I bit my lip to keep from answering. His rules echoed in my mind: don’t talk, don’t come near, keep your distance.

I watched him in the rearview mirror of the car.

James Reynolds was the kind of man who made women sigh when he walked into a room. Tall, almost 6’3"", his broad shoulders perfectly filled out his tailored Italian suits. His black hair, always smoothed with gel, highlighted his aristocratic features - defined jaw, straight nose, thick eyebrows that shaded sapphire-blue eyes. But they were cold, calculating eyes that never smiled, even when his well-shaped lips curved into a social smile.

When we finally pulled up in front of the imposing Reynolds Enterprises building, James got out of the car and slammed the door shut, his perfectly tailored Italian suit a stark contrast to his stormy expression.

I let my tense muscles relax for a brief moment, but then I noticed the black leather briefcase was still in the backseat.

“James,” I called softly through the window, but he had already disappeared through the revolving doors.

I looked at the briefcase, my heart racing. There were important documents in there, I knew. Documents he would need for the meeting.

Rule number one echoed in my mind again: no talking during the ride.

But the ride was over, and I didn’t have his phone number. I didn’t have my husband’s phone number. Undecided, I stared at the briefcase for no more than a few seconds.

I glanced at myself in the rearview mirror to check my appearance, which needed to be perfect. My shoulder-length blonde hair and light makeup were presentable.

I headed toward the reception to hand it over.

Distracted by my anxiety, I didn’t notice the unevenness on the floor. When I realized it, I had already tripped, feeling a sharp pain in my knee. A slight cut, but enough to make the blood run.

“Damn,” I muttered.

I stood up with a nervous urge, heading quickly to the building’s reception area. My hurried footsteps echoed throughout the room.

“Where is James Reynolds’ office?”

“Who wants it?” the receptionist asked with an inquisitive look, shaking my resolve.

I hesitated for a brief moment before answering.

“I’m Laura, his wife.”

The words came out like venom, each syllable imbued with a resentment I could barely contain.

“Penthouse. Use the private elevator,” she replied without hesitation.

The elevator doors opened to reveal a large reception area with a glass wall. Through the reflection, I saw James, absorbed in a phone call, sitting majestically behind his desk.

“How can someone so handsome be so cruel?” I muttered to myself.

I felt a chill run down my spine when our eyes met - his, as cold as a steel blade.

“What do you think you’re doing?” he questioned, approaching me irritably.

“You forgot something in the car. I don’t have your phone number to let you know,” I replied, trying to remain calm.

For a few seconds, his gaze examined me thoroughly, until he came across my bleeding knee.

One of his secretaries appeared in the doorway, she was dressed in an outfit that was too sexy for a simple secretary.

“Sir, meeting in a minute,” she announced, and her eyes rested on me for a moment.

“Let them wait,” he said, with an indifferent tone that left no room for debate.

His eyes looked at me again, intense. “Come to my office.”

I hesitated, torn between the instinct to retreat and the curiosity his words had aroused.

“Are you just going to stand there?”

The impatience in his voice made me react, and I quickened my pace to follow him.

When I reached the living room, he stared at me with a mixture of suspicion and authority.

“How did you get hurt?” he asked, but his tone was more of a demand than any sign of concern.

“It was just a fall. Nothing serious,” I mumbled, looking away.

“Sit down.”

Without waiting for an answer, he left the room. Before I could decide whether to obey, he returned, carrying antiseptic and a pack of Band-Aids. He placed the items on the table between us with a direct gesture.

“Take care of it,” he ordered, his voice thick with authority.

“It’s nothing,” I insisted, in the same hushed tone as before.

“I didn’t ask if it was,” he replied, his eyes fixed on mine. “How many times do I have to repeat myself?” he said, his tone sharp. “You’re a Reynolds now. You can’t go around looking like that, slovenly. This isn’t about you, it’s about my family’s reputation.”

Those words fell like a stone to my stomach. For a foolish moment, I even believed there was some trace of genuine concern in his attitude.

It was just pride, nothing more.

Before I could react, he grabbed my phone, his movements quick and precise. Without asking for permission, he typed something and handed it back to me.

“You now have my number,” he declared, cold as ever. “Call only in cases of life or death.”

I swallowed hard, fighting the urge to say something that would only make the situation worse. I simply closed my hand around the phone, a silent reminder of who was in control.

# Chapter 3: Eva

My stepmother called me saying she needed to speak to me urgently. Her only pressing matters were money or Molly, my stepsister.

When I entered the coffee shop, I saw her sitting at the back table. She was impeccably dressed in a navy blue dress that highlighted her elegant figure. The smile on her lips was refined and discreet.

“Laura, my dear, you look great. Marriage really does work miracles, doesn’t it?”

Eva began, with that honeyed tone that I recognized as the prelude to something disturbing.

“Eva. Why did you ask me to come here, to this place far from home?”

Eva raised her eyebrows, feigning surprise.

“I wanted to talk to you away from your father. You know he has a weak heart.”

“I don’t have much time.”

“But okay, I’ll get straight to the point. I’m in a delicate situation, my dear. Some unexpected bills, an investment opportunity I can’t miss… You understand, don’t you? After all, who doesn’t want a better future?”

I narrowed my eyes. “And what’s that to me?”

Eva smiled, leaning forward.

“You’re married to a powerful and financially comfortable man. I thought it might be a good time to show him that you can contribute to the family business, too. Perhaps a discreet request for money to help with my situation?”

I felt my stomach churn. “You want me to ask James for money? Is that it?”

“Exactly! He would never say no to you if he knew how to ask. We women have our tricks.”

Eva gave a wicked smile. “And speaking of which, dear, you should think about getting pregnant soon. Nothing binds a man more than an heir. And honestly, he’s over thirty.”

My face burned with anger and humiliation. “You must know that well.”

“Oh, but it is, dear. I’m only thinking about your well-being.”

Eva paused, watching my reaction. Then, with a darker expression, she added. “And I know things between you and James aren’t exactly perfect. Or should I say... I know you slept in the guest room on your wedding night.”

I felt the ground shift beneath my feet. “How do you know that?”

Eva gave me a victorious smile.

“I have my ways. Don’t think you can fool me, Laura. James is no fool, and you should take advantage of the position you have while you can. If you keep this up, you’ll end up like your mother: alone and with nothing.”

The mention of my mother was the breaking point. I stood up suddenly, the chair scraping against the floor with a sharp sound.",1,1752813193.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Thinks ""Veikkausliiga"" Is a Type of Finnish Gummy*

---

### Parse the Odds: A Lopsided Love Letter to Inter Turku

Let’s cut to the chase: **FC Inter Turku is the morning glory of this matchup**, and FC KTP is the wilted daisy clinging to the篱笆. The odds, as gleefully provided by bookmakers like FanDuel and BetMGM, paint a picture of a team (Inter Turku) so dominant, they’ve priced FC KTP at **+800** — which, in human terms, is the sports betting equivalent of “we’re throwing money at hope.”

* **Inter Turku’s Implied Probability**: At decimal odds of \~1.34 (or American +340 for the math-challenged), Turku’s chances of winning sit at **74%**. That’s the same confidence level as betting that a Finnish winter will eventually end.
* **FC KTP’s Implied Probability**: At +800 (decimal \~12.5), KTP’s chances are a laughable **8%**. For context, this is slightly more likely than me understanding why “KTP” is an actual team name.
* **The Spread**: Inter Turku is favored by **-1.5 goals**, meaning they must win by two to satisfy the voracious appetite of the pointspread gods. If they only win by one, bettors get a participation trophy and a coupon for 50% off their next existential dread.
* **Totals**: The “Over/Under” is set at **3.0 goals**, with Over priced at \~1.78. Given Turku’s offense and KTP’s defense (see: porous as a sieve that’s also on fire), this game could end up looking like a popcorn machine exploded on the pitch.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Rumors, and One Team Named “KTP”

While no official injury reports were provided (probably because Finland’s sports media budget is funded by a single coffee can), we can speculate based on the following:

* **FC Inter Turku**: Their star striker, **Teemu Pukki’s cousin’s neighbor’s pet hedgehog**, has reportedly joined the starting XI. Yes, it’s that kind of team. Seriously, though, Inter Turku has been a consistent force in the Veikkausliiga, and their recent form suggests they’re the ki

So I’ve been thinking lately about starting a business in Hyderabad, but honestly, I’m a bit unsure about what actually works in the market. I’ve got a few ideas in mind and would love to hear your opinions or experiences.

1. Poultry business – Like setting up a small farm somewhere on the outskirts. Not sure if it’s still a good market or if it’s too risky now?

2. A cafe with a mix of everything – Biryani, pizza, burgers, pasta, ice cream, and maybe live or recorded music. Something with nice vibes and a little nature-themed setup.

3. A cozy coffee place – Good ambience, comfortable seating, a spot where people can work or study. Is there a real demand for this kind of space?

4. A gym/fitness center – Seems like people are getting more health conscious, but is it still a profitable space?

Also, curious to know your thoughts on franchises. Is it better to start something of your own or go the franchise route?

If anyone can share a rough investment idea (not exact, just ballpark min-max), that would really help too.

Would really appreciate any feedback or ideas.

I’ve been toying with an idea and wanted to run it by this community before diving deeper.

What if there was a network of 10 beautifully designed Airbnb-style properties across Europe (starting with Greece, Portugal, Spain, and France), specifically for digital nomads, founders, and remote teams?

Think:
	•	🛏️ Boutique resort vibes — calm, aesthetic, but not outrageously priced (definitely not Aman or Soho House)
	•	⚡ Seriously fast Wi-Fi, tested and guaranteed
	•	🧑‍💻 Proper co-working zones, not some corner with a coffee machine
	•	🧘 Wellness-focused design — yoga decks, forest saunas, plunge pools
	•	🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Access to a like-minded nomad community
	•	🗓️ Max 30 days per property per year — so you can rotate
	•	🌍 New vibe, new place every month if you want to change scenery or explore markets

The idea is not for regular tourists — this is meant for people who are building stuff, scaling, shipping, creating. I know that when I’m deep in a project, a good space and the right energy make all the difference.

- SG says this crime was sexually motivated.
- SG reveals that the autopsy showed that Kaylee had damage to her mouth in a way that indicates she was gagged or attempted to be gagged. 
- When arrested, BK made a comment to an officer that they should get a cup of coffee and that he would love to interview the officer for his studies.
