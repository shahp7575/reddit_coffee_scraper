1lcwy04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lcwy04/i_dont_know_if_i_should_keep_not_talking_to_my/,I don't know if I should keep not talking to my friend or not,"I've got this friend called N who I've considered one of my best friends. We are both part of a big friend group where there is this other girl who we'll call L. I don't like her, because of the way she acts, the ""pranks"" she makes and her whole person itself. We both tolerate each other and that's that.

We were in class together, and sure, I had some doubts in our friendship, but they weren't really important (I already made a post about one of this about a year ago, in case you want more context).

Okay, so last year our whole friend group went on our end of school trip. N practically ignored me during this whole trip, spending all her time with L. I understood that they might be better friends than me and N, so I didn't say anything and continued. She didn't talk to me during the whole trip (I even had to see if I had done anything wrong, which I didn't). The only time she came to talk to me was on our way back, after L had gotten mad at her, to ask me how was the trip going. 

Anyways, I didn't think more of it. Summer started and I didn't see anyone (I'm away for summer), but I did text and everything. 

So the holidays end and I decide to meet with N. We see eachother after like 2 months and I realised that she's changed, but, again, understandable, it's been two months. So we start talking about summer and she tells me how she's been spending a lot of time with L (at this point I had stopped caring about them) and how they've been drinking, which surprised me the most, because we are both underage (15-16 at the time). She's never been known to act in any irresponsible way or anything like that, it's always been more of L's thing. I think, maybe it's just a summer thing, and she's just making it sound way more different than it really is.

So we go to this coffee/restaurant, which everyone knows serves drinks to minors, especifically because she wanted to drink. I'm like okay, I'm not going to be a party pooper or anything. 

All throughout the conversation I strat realising that she acts and sounds exactly like L. I don't really like that, but I don't say anything, and accept that she might've changed. 

So we keep on talking to eachother through texts, and I start reading this book she recommended me. I like the book and give her updates on it, and I send her memes and ask her about her life.

Now one day I realise that she hasn't been the one to text me for a while. The last time we had talked was when I had finished the book. So I convince myself that it's all probably in my head, and I'm making things up. I say, okay let's not text her, and we'll see how she will text soon

She hasn't texted yet and we're in June. This happened around September/October.

My friend group has organised birthday parties all throughout the year, none to which I've been invited. From all of the 12 people in the group, most of whom I'd thought I'd keep in contact with (we all had to change schools), only 3 have dared to talk to me this year. My best friend, A, also had been in that friend group, and it's thanks to her that I know that they were going to celebrate said birthday parties. 

A says I shouldn't bother with them, after they treated me the way they did, but I miss N and the friendship we had. It's true that I'm not interested in being friends with someone who acts the same way as L, so I don't know what to do. ",1,1750090267.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I was wondering if anyone knew of spaces that are already free or would be willing to waive fees for groups like ours.

The odds were stacked against me in terms of going to class today, so I decided to get some coffee, stay home, and be productive here to make up for it. 

On my way to the coffee shop, I see a fledgling Robin standing in the middle of the road, not responding to anything. It's a BUSY road, and kept driving even though i felt guilty. Stopping would have been more dangerous.

About 20min later, I'm driving the same way home and he's still there. 
I'm a big softy, and it was in one of those wide medians for a turn lane, so I pulled over, read that a fledgling may just be frozen in fear, and I decided to grab a towel from my trunk, wait for traffic to clear, then snatch him up and move him to the grass (or hopefully jumpstart him enough to get him to fly away). 
It all goes well, traffic clears, and then when i get close enough to him I see he's bleeding from his head. I still decide to try to pick him up, and when I did, he SCREAMED, after watching me approach and not reacting at all to my presence. I knew I was hurting him when i picked him up, even though I was being gentle, and he didn't fly out of my hands but glided back down to the road. 
I tried to pick him up one more time, and I knew I was hurting him again. He glided into the traffic lane, and it was dangerous once we were out if the median. He was still bleeding.

I know when it's appropriate to help a turtle cross a road, and I know how to do it safely. I don't know about birds, but I have a feeling he was beyond saving. Blood was visible from the head, and the way he responded to being maneuvered made me wonder if there was damage I couldn't see, too. I knew the guy was hurting, and I didn't know what to do. 

That being said, /I don't know about birds/. He could have had a slight abrasion (heads bleed a lot, even if it's a thin cut), had been frozen in fear, and I just left him to die. I decided to leave him in the road, in the traffic lane. I didn't have time to think, and if he had damage, I came to the conclusion that a swift death was more humane than letting him bleed out, or suffer whatever trauma he had endured. 

I don't know what the right decision was. People watched me leave it, they were honking at me, but i knew i was hurting it by trying to help and i had to walk away. I have been crying since it happened this morning and I feel so terrible. I tried to clean out my car to take my mind off of it and his feathers were all over the towel. I'm inconsolable. 

I feel so sick, he was just a little guy and I was powerless. That was the worst decision I've ever had to make and I'm so scared I made the wrong one.",1,1750089957.0,venting,0,0.99,False

I was introducing my wife to some of my classmates, and I got distracted taking a photo with some of the guys making silly faces and whatnot. 

I was standing there, laughing and having a good time, but when I turned around to look for my mom, I realized she was talking to one of my classmates and was trying to show her a picture of one of her cats on her phone. I noticed, from
where I was standing, that she had pictures of me pre-transition and was holding her phone in a way in which my classmate could see everything. When I saw her scrolling through those photos, I immediately grabbed her phone and said, ‚ÄúWe might need to get you better glasses. Let me help you find that photo.‚Äù 

I think I died inside for a minute. My classmates don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm trans. I kept telling myself that maybe she didn‚Äôt see anything, but I‚Äôm sure my mom might have accidentally shown her some of those pictures. I don‚Äôt know how long they were talking, and I don‚Äôt know exactly what she saw, but I felt like fucking crap. I felt so sick I almost fainted. My hands went numb, and I got so lightheaded I kept thinking, ‚Äúfuck, I‚Äôm about to collapse.‚Äù 

I told my wife what had happened, and she tried to reassure me everything‚Äôs okay. She said I could always say I have a sister or something and even came up with this silly story, but the issue is that my wife was also in some of those photos. I kept thinking maybe she just wasn‚Äôt paying attention, but then remembered that about a month ago, I met my classmate at a coffee shop to work on our final project. My wife picked me up and offered her a ride. I was about to shit my pants, and the restroom at the coffee shop was out of order, so we stopped by our place first. My classmate asked if she could use our restroom too. While I was üí©, my wife entered our room and changed her outfit. So when I was done, I walked towards the living room, and I saw my classmate was standing by the dining room table reading whatever was on it and I noticed that the RX info, for my testosterone, was theeüíÄüíÄ.

Anyway, I sometimes set a camera for our dog, so when we got home, I checked the security footage, and I saw my classmate was wandering around our house ü´†, checking things‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know who the fuck does that, but she was just checking things like she was at her own place. I‚Äôm sure she saw my prescription. I know you don‚Äôt have to be trans to be taking testosterone, but I feel like with these two incidents, she might have put two and two together. 

My wife was trying to make me feel better by saying that she hopes my classmate is mature enough not to say anything or not to be gossiping around IF she indeed figured out I‚Äôm trans, but I feel like fucking crap. It‚Äôs making me not want to interact with any of my classmates anymore out of fear she might have told people. ",1,1750089946.0,FTMOver30,2,1.0,False

Wanted to share my notes from Rhonda's latest pod all about the the longevity benefits of coffee. She really brought the heat with this one. Highly recommend. Timestamps linked below and her references are shown on screen. Here it is in full: [https://youtu.be/vgrV9rjqQyA](https://youtu.be/vgrV9rjqQyA)

Turns out, coffee is actually VERY good for you. But a few caveats related to how you brew it and when you consume it. My notes:

1. Each daily cup of coffee consumed correlates with a **reduction in your epigenetic age by 0.7 to 1 full year**, with three cups reducing accelerated aging risk **by nearly 40%.** So pretty darn good for longevity. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=84s))
2. Drinking dark roast coffee daily correlates with a reduction in **severe DNA double-strand breaks by 23%** (the same genetic damage caused by radiation), significantly reducing cancer risk. I think a pretty common misconception is that coffee increase cancer risk. Not the case. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=84s))
3. **Drinking unfiltered coffee like French press or espresso raises LDL cholesterol by up to 30 mg/dL within weeks.** Filtered brewing methods (including paper-drip, instant, or cold brew) remove this risk. Probably the most IMPORTANT part of the episode. Man... I had no idea. Espresso too. Something about these molecules called diterpenes that don't get filtered out. They raise LDL-C. I think another way to think about this.... there's just no reason your morning coffee should be raising your LDL-C. I think she mentions she uses instant coffee ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=961s))
4. Drinking three or more cups of caffeinated coffee daily **reduces Parkinson‚Äôs and Alzheimer‚Äôs risk by 34‚Äì37%**. So when it comes to the brain... caffeinated is superior to decaf, by FAR. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=1720s))
5. Drinking **2‚Äì4 cups of coffee daily boosts gut production of short-chain fatty acids**. Ok... so here's why that's important. This tightens the gut barrier, reducing inflammation. Also enhances insulin sensitivity. So turns out coffee is actually amazing for your gut. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=819s))
6. **Adding dairy to coffee reduces immediate antioxidant absorption by 20‚Äì30%.** This significantly blunts coffee‚Äôs rapid cognitive benefits. Best to drink it black if you want the brain boost. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=2526s))
7. Combining **100‚Äì200 mg L-theanine with coffee significantly enhances sustained attention, improves accuracy, and speeds reaction times** through increased GABA and glycine signaling. I think most people know l-theanine calms the caffeine's jitters, but I did NOT know how it kind of amplifies coffee's cognitive benefits. Good stuff. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=2719s))
8. Drinking 2-3 cups of coffee daily **reduces diabetes risk by up to 60%** through AMPK activation. So coffee is elite for metabolic health. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=481s))
9. Each daily cup of coffee you drink is associated with **roughly a 15 to 20% reduction in liver cancer risk, and about a 10% lower risk of endometrial cancer**, with maximum benefits seen around 4-5 cups per day. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=1240s))
10. **95% of coffee samples globally contain mold toxins far below safety limits**‚Äîand roasting beans further reduces levels by 70‚Äì90%. Oh man... this one is for you Dave A\_sprey. Guy made a living on freaking people out about mold in coffee. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=2363s))

1lcwmty,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1lcwmty/the_christianityled_gender_gap_is_anything_but/,The Christianity-led gender gap is anything but ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù.,"I‚Äôm saying all this as a woman, so
If you‚Äôre a misogynist or patriarch you can already start getting yourself pre-mad going in.

God doesn‚Äôt give a damn about gender. He just doesn‚Äôt. He wants followers and good people. He wants people with compassion and empathy. Women are not merely
Incubators, many women like myself can‚Äôt get pregnant. We still have purpose outside of that. We are still God‚Äôs daughters. We still hope. We still learn. We still love.

All this ‚Äúwomen should submit‚Äù, but nobody saying that ever talks about the pairing verse that says husbands should love and cherish and treasure their wives, and listen to her complaints. Are you listening to her complaints when you accuse her of ‚Äúnagging‚Äù? Are you cherishing and treasuring her when you guilt her into having sex with you anyway even though she‚Äôs told you she doesn‚Äôt feel well, or had a long day working as a nurse and isn‚Äôt up to it tonight? Are you loving her when despite the fact that you both work full time jobs, you somehow still expect HER to be the one keeping up the house, cleaning, cooking, and doing all the baby stuff, getting up early to get the kids ready for school, and to make YOUR lunch and coffee so YOU can sleep in? And all because supposedly, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how God designed it‚Äù?

God didn‚Äôt design it. You‚Äôre just a misogynist. You treat women like slaves and sex objects. You don‚Äôt care about our complaints. When a woman has the audacity to stand up and let her voice be heard, she‚Äôs accused of being ‚Äúemotional‚Äù or being on her period or other such insults. (Spoiler alert plenty of women don‚Äôt get periods either, and I‚Äôm not just talking about trans women or menopause).

If you want to honor God you start by honoring women. Stop objectifying us, stop treating us the same way you‚Äôd beat a man into the dirt if he EVER treated your daughter or sister half as badly. Common arguments are ‚Äúthat‚Äôs someone‚Äôs daughter, or sister, or mother‚Äù, but that doesn‚Äôt quite do it, because it still puts the onus on us belonging to someone else, on us only having value because of our correlation to a man. You know what else we are even before we‚Äôre someone‚Äôs daughter, sister or mother? We are simply SOMEONE. A person. A human being with feelings.

Next time you want to pretend to be so Godly, look at how you treat women, even without realizing it. Look at how your friends or male relatives treat women. You should be calling out your best friend for how he is to women the same way you would a random guy making the exact same comments to your daughter. Because that other woman is not only also someone‚Äôs daughter, she is SOMEONE.

There is nothing Christlike, Christian or Godly about letting misogyny and patriarchy go on unchecked and unabated. Women are not your play things, and we are not your physical or emotional laborers or torture devices. We are human, and we are God‚Äôs precious most adored and loved daughters, and you will, one day see the error of your ways and your theologies. If not by our own hand or your daughters or wives, then by God‚Äôs.

God loves his daughters so damn much. He loves his sons too. But his sons aren‚Äôt the ones being vilified, broken, beaten down, dismissed, disregarded and objectified, raped, killed, and then if they have the audacity to speak up and plea for their liberation vilified some more and called narcissists or a bitch, all on account of them simply being sons.

God loves his precious daughters. Think about that next time you want to whistle at one of us or make inappropriate comments or send us inappropriate pictures online without us asking, or make excuses for rapists or men who treat women badly as described above, because it‚Äôs apparently all fine because you can just go to church on Sunday and ask for forgiveness, then just turn right around and start doing and saying all the same things again on Monday.

GOD LOVES HIS DAUGHTERS.",4,1750089583.0,Christianity,4,0.75,False

Already too hot out. The kind of morning where you take your coffee slower, let it cool a little. I don‚Äôt mind that pace. Suits me, actually.

I‚Äôm 39. Beard is permanent at this point. Tattoos too. Some bright, some quiet. All a part of me. Most of them mean something. A few meant more when they were new. That‚Äôs how it goes.

In Texas. Life‚Äôs full, but not loud. The edges are well-kept. That said, every now and then I find myself wondering who else might be out there, just slightly off-center, thinking things they‚Äôre not saying.

Not looking to stir the pot. Not looking to overshare either. But I‚Äôve always had a soft spot for a good conversation that sort of slides sideways halfway through. Especially when it‚Äôs with someone who knows how to keep my attention.

1lcwlbz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lcwlbz,Inside the Pancake Cake,"As requested, here‚Äôs a peek inside.

Here is also more info:  it‚Äôs a vanilla cake but I added a little cinnamon and a touch of maple to the batter.  I wanted to get a cinnamon swirl like a coffee cake but it sunk. So you can‚Äôt see it like I wanted but you can taste it.  I really thought the cake was going to be dry when I saw the crumb and how it cut but surprisingly, it‚Äôs not.  But it‚Äôs also not ‚Äúsoft or fluffy‚Äù.  Everything got a splash of maple so the overall taste is pancakes.  Really sweet pancakes.  I wish the blueberry was thicker but this was my first time using a filling and it felt like I used a ton. So there are many things I‚Äôd do differently but as a first time, I‚Äôm happy and my husband loved it.   I also made a small version for my dad. My parents were really confused about it being cake.  lol

I used these directions for the decorating:

I used this for the fondant. It makes a fondant that tastes amazing - like marshmallows.  I don‚Äôt add all the store fondant she recommends and it works out fine without it.

https://sugargeekshow.com/news/fondant-recipe/ Fondant Recipe (homemade) + Video Tutorial | Sugar Geek Show

And I used this for the cake but next time I‚Äôll probably buy boxed.  I added a cinnamon swirl to it with just brown sugar and cinnamon with a little butter.

I really think using boxed when doing so much decorating makes sense.  Then the homemade cakes can be just easy frosting.  It‚Äôs hard to do both.

It was late September when I had returned home. I had just come back from a summer camp that lasted two months. I couldn't tell you much about the camp or its counselors. I know I had a good time, except when I got lost during a group nature hike. When I finally was able to find my way back to camp, it was late, and no one was in camp. 

When I returned home, my parents were surprised to see me.

""M-Max... you're home?"" My mother asked.

 She slowly approached me and looked me up and down. She then dropped to her knees and hugged me. I could see my father standing in the doorway looking at both of us; he swiftly turned and locked himself in the den. 

He must have still been angry with me. Before summer camp, I had broken into his gun cabinet with some friends from school. My friend Benny accidentally pulled the trigger of one of the guns and shot a hole in the wall. No one was hurt, but my friends scattered, leaving me with the smoking gun. When my dad found out what had happened, I got the lecture of a lifetime. 

""Do you have any idea how stupid that was? You're extremely lucky no one was hurt!"" He scolded.

 ""I'd ground you, but I'm just glad you'll be out of my sight for the next two months!"" He then kicked me out of the den and sent me to my room without dinner.

 A knock at my door startled me as I was looking at some magazines Benny had snuck me during class. I opened the door to see my sister, Ryleigh, standing there with a plate of food. 

""Mom said to sneak you a plate."" She said, pushing the plate into my chest.

 She was taller than me, but I would assume her big, colorful hair that reeked of hairspray helped to contribute to her height. I looked her up and down, seeing her wearing her jean jacket vest with her 'Black Sabbath' shirt underneath. Her neck was weighed down by the several necklaces she frequently wore.

 ""Are you going out?"" I had asked. 

""No, twerp, I just dress this way and put on war paint before I go to lala land."" She sneered.

 ""Do Mom and Dad know?"" I asked, chewing through some broccoli.

 ""They don't, and you better not tell them either."" She whispered. ""Or I'll tell Mom about your noody mags, you little perv."" 

She had me dead to rights. I nodded, agreeing to keep my mouth shut. Later that night, after my parents went to bed, I heard the window open from Ryleigh's room. I went back to bed. The next morning, I came down for breakfast: pancakes, eggs, and bacon, a weekend staple for my family. My dad already sat at the table, coffee in front of him, his nose in the paper. He never said a word to anyone until his second cup of coffee, but today, he was extra silent. Must still be angry with me.

 Ryleigh didn't come down for breakfast, normal for nights she sneaks out. 

""Are you excited about going to summer camp, sweetie?"" My mom has asked.

 I nodded as I stuffed my face with bacon.

 ""Will your friend Benny be there with us?"" She asked, putting down a plate of food for my dad. 

""No, he ended up getting summer school."" I said, looking back at my mom. I could hear my father scoff from behind his paper; he never liked Benny, said he was a bad influence.

 It wasn't until the early afternoon when Ryleigh finally came downstairs, still wearing her 'Black Sabbath' shirt from last night, her hair a mess, and her makeup mostly cleaned off with the slightest hint of eyeliner. She shot me a look as she grabbed a plate covered in plastic wrap from inside the microwave; she then sat down next to me on the couch and watched cartoons with me. 

""What time are you supposed to be leaving?"" She asked.

 ""Ummmm, I think 2pm?"" I answered, not entirely sure.

 ""What is the name of the camp?"" She asked. 

""Ummmm, Camp Mannatari I think it's called."" I answered.

 ""Oh, that's it in Sleepy Falls. I remember we went there once on a family vacation; you were like two years old when we went. It was a weird place."" She said.

""Weird how?"" I questioned. 

""I don't know; I just remember something not right about that place. Maybe it was just because I was seven at the time; the world seems a lot bigger and stranger when you're a kid."" She laughed.

""You're still a kid."" I quipped. 

""Yeah, yeah. I graduate next year, and I'll likely be moving away for college. Mom will be devastated. Look out for her, okay?"" She said, ruffling up my brown curls with her fingers. 

I could smell the faint scent of cigarettes stained on her fingers. I tried cigarettes once with Benny; I felt like the inside of my throat was being punched by a fist that was on fire. 

It was about 2:14pm when a bus pulled up to the house with 'Camp Mannatari' written on the side of it. I hugged my sister, and my mom kissed the top of my head. My dad was there to see me off, but he didn't say anything, didn't even shake my hand like he normally would do whenever I went somewhere for a long time.It was about a four-hour drive until we reached the small town of Sleepy Falls. 

The bus weaved through the winding streets of the market district of the town. The townspeople all would come out of the shops to see the bus drive by. None of them waved or smiled; they just looked at us. When we reached the treeline for the forest, it was another 20 minutes until we reached the camp. The counselors greeted us at the bunkhouses and commanded us to gather our belongings and head to our designated bunks. 

The first few days at camp were mostly just a tour of the camp. It had a lake with boats and fishing, various tables for eating and crafts, an archery area, a go-cart track, and a garden. There was a hiking trail that would lead deeper into the forest. By the fourth night, the counselors sat us by a fire to share ghost stories. 

""Ms. Keen, could you tell us about how the camp got its name?"" One kid asked. 

The young counselor known as Ms. Keen was only a few years older than my own sister, with straight red hair that was pulled back into a ponytail. 

""Of course, so the town of Sleepy Falls was founded by European settlers in the 15th century. There was a local legend about a forest guardian known as the Mannatari that would stalk the forest and abduct those who wandered into the woods. No one knows if this legend was brought over by the European settlers or if it was a story created by the local tribes. Some say it's some sort of fae; others say it's a spirit. She explained. 

I raised my hand to gain an answer to the question that began to swell my brain. 

""Yes... Max, was it?"" She said, pointing at me.

""Why would they name the camp after a monster that abducts people?"" I asked.

""I believe it was in honor of the creature's benevolent behavior as a protector of the forest."" She answered. 

""Now, how would you all like to hear the story of the Horseman from Hell?"" She asked. 

The kids cheered, ready for the next scary story. I didn't pay much attention to the rest of the night. When we all turned in for bed, I just thought about how much I already missed home: my mom, Ryleigh, even my dad.

The next couple of months were just regularly scheduled events. A couple of weeks before the end of camp, Ms. Keen became sick. She stayed in her bunkhouse most days, only occasionally being seen from her window, watching us play. Eventually we stopped seeing her. I asked another counselor what had happened to her. 

""Oh, Ms. Keen? We had to send her to the hospital. She was really sick and not getting any better."" He answered. 

""Will she be back before the end of camp?"" I asked.

""N-no...M-maybe next year."" He answered. ""Hey, uh, no more questions; let's get ready for one of our last nature hikes."" He said. 

The hike was like all the others: same trail, same trees, same plants. During the hike, I started to lag behind a bit, daydreaming about what happened to Ms. Keen and thinking about how by the end of the week, I'll be back home. I hope my dad isn't still mad at me. 

""Mah...Mah...Max,"" a voice reached out from behind a tree.

 I stopped in my tracks, looking around, but I didn't see anyone.

 ""Mah-Max."" The voice said again. I recognized that voice, even though I hadn't heard it in three weeks; it was Ms. Keen. 

""Ms. Keen? Is that you?"" I asked.

 ""P-please help me...Y-you don't have to do this."" Ms. Keen said.

""P-please follow me, children."" She called to me.

""Guys! Hey, I found Ms. Keen! I think she's hurt."" I yelled to the group ahead of me, but they didn't hear me.

 I decided to follow the voice to find Ms. Keen; if she was hurt, I could help her using the first aid skills I learned from one of the camp events. I followed the voice further into the forest, farther away from the trail. Before I knew it, I got turned around; I was lost. I never found Ms. Keen. I decided to backtrack the best I could back to the camp. Somehow, someway, I made it back.

I was still being embraced by my mother; she was crying on my shoulder. I could feel her hot breath from her wails against me, her tears slowly dripping into my shirt. From the den, I heard a loud pop sound. It was a similar sound to when Benny accidentally shot the gun in there months ago, just more muffled. I could hear rumbling coming from the stairs as Ryleigh came running down then.

""What the fuck happened?"" She cried. She came and stopped in the doorway as soon as she saw me. 

""R-ryleigh..."" I said as I pulled myself away from my mother's grasp, she collapsed to her hands and knees as she cried even harder into the tile. 

""What the fuck?!"" She screamed as she turned around and ran back upstairs and slammed her bedroom door.

 I walked over to the phone on the wall and picked it up and listened. I could hear Ryleigh's ragged breath, her trying to hold back tears.

 ""911, what is your emergency?"" A voice asked. 

""Hello? Please send help! I'm at 3232 W. Holly Ln."" She said desperately.

""What is happening there?"" The operator asked.

""It's my brother. He's downstairs with my mother. I think my father shot himself."" She cried.

""Your father shot himself, ok, we'll send a cruiser and an ambulance your way."" The operator said.

""No, that's not it; my brother disappeared a month ago at summer camp. They found his body in the woods; we buried him last week. That THING downstairs is not my brother!"" She screamed, her voice finally breaking down in cries of both sadness and fear.

1lcwhqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/bhutan/comments/1lcwhqn/yolo_cafe_or_is_it_eateries_review/,Yolo Cafe (or is it Eateries?) Review,"So a couple of us went to Yolo Cafe/Eateries for lunch today. Was dying to post something on here so lemme just give a review of the place.

First of all, Place aesthetics: its a nice and cozy place imo. The coffee aroma as soon as you enter the place is amazing (if you love coffee of course). You get a good view of the Clock Tower from the place, and its spacious as well. If you're looking for a budget internet caf√©, it's a solid choice.

As for the food, we weren't in the mood or anything extravagant, so we just ordered these:

Pizzas: we got a Margherita pizza and a Pollo Pizza (minced chicken). Size kinda small, but expected at that price range. The Margherita was pretty good, I'd say 8/10, whereas the Pollo tasted weird (I definitely prefer larger chunks of chicken on my pizza.) I'd give that a 6.5/10.

Meated Fries: basically fries with minced chicken. It had a weird taste. Plain fries would've been way better. 6.5/10

Chicken Burger: man do I have a lot to say on this. First of all, it was cold (üôÑ) and cold burgers are never a good sign. Secondly, if you were to compare a piece of thinly sliced ham to the chicken patty, the latter would be slightly bigger. The burger was made up of the sliced-ham ahh patty, tomato, lettuce, cheese, eggs, cucumber. Surely you'd expect to taste chicken in your chicken burger, but nope. All I tasted was the lettuce, cucumber and tomato (I dont even remember if there was any mind of sauce there). Very very disappointing, I'd give a 3/10.

Drinks: got myself an oreo shake. Nothing spectacular. I'd give a 7.5. 

Overall, the food comes to about 6.3/10. Margherita carried immensely.

For service, is was pretty good. Took forever for the cold burgers, but everything else was fine.

Finally, price was great imo. There were 8 of us and the bill came up to 3k. That's about 375 per person, so pretty affordable. I'd say its about 70% justified, since it was pretty decent (except for the cold burgers).

Verdict: like I said, its an affordable internet caf√©. Price is also reasonable compared to others like Coffee Culture and Ambient Cafe, but you shouldn't really be expecting incredible and life changing food. Also remember that this is just for the burger and pizzas, there were other stuff on the menu like sandwiches, fried rice and ramen. Maybe someone who had those could share their opinions below.",1,1750089248.0,bhutan,0,1.0,False

1lcwg5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/HubermanLab/comments/1lcwg5m/my_top_10_takeaways_from_rhonda_patricks_new/,My top 10 takeaways from Rhonda Patrick's new episode about the longevity benefits of coffee,"What's up boys. Dr. Rhonda Patrick just released a banger of an episode all about the longevity benefits of coffee. 50 minutes. Knowledge bomb after knowledge bomb. Watch it if you have the time. Here it is: [https://youtu.be/vgrV9rjqQyA](https://youtu.be/vgrV9rjqQyA)

Turns out... coffee is actually VERY good for you. But a few caveats. I'll get into that below. Some stuff you should know. My notes:

1. Each cup of coffee you drink daily correlates with a **reduced epigenetic age (something like a 0.7-1 year reduction per cup consumed)**, and 3 cups/day reduces accelerated aging risk **by nearly 40%.** So it's clearly good for you when it comes to longevity. Obviously there's some sort of cap to this. You can't just drink 20 cups/day and get infinite benefits. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=84s))
2. Drinking dark roast coffee daily **cuts severe DNA double-strand breaks by 23%** (reduces cancer risk big time). Key emphasis on dark roast. So another big benefit here, it's good for your DNA. I think a ton of people think coffee *increases* cancer risk, not the case. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=84s))
3. Drinking unfiltered coffee like French press or espresso **raises LDL cholesterol by up to 30 mg/dL within weeks**. THIS IS IMPORTANT, probably the most important part of the episode. Unfiltered brewing methods (like French press) actually raise your cholesterol. I had no idea. Something about these molecules called diterpenes that don't get filtered out. They raise LDL-C. Better options: instant coffee (surprising), your standard filtered coffee pot, and pour over with a paper filter. I guess cold brew too. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=961s))
4. Drinking 3 or more cups of caffeinated coffee daily **reduces Parkinson‚Äôs and Alzheimer‚Äôs risk by 34‚Äì37%**. BAM. Caffeine is very good for your brain. Great news. Drink up. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=1720s))
5. Drinking **2‚Äì4 cups of coffee daily boosts gut production of short-chain fatty acids.** Ok so why does this matter. Let's break it down. This actually tightens the gut barrier and reduces gut inflammation. So turns out coffee is actually amazing for your gut. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=819s))
6. **Adding dairy to coffee reduces immediate antioxidant absorption by 20‚Äì30%**, significantly blunting coffee‚Äôs cognitive benefits. AGAIN, VERY IMPORTANT. do not add dairy if you want the cognitive benefits. Drink it black. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=2526s))
7. Combining **100‚Äì200 mg L-theanine with coffee significantly enhances sustained attention, improves accuracy, and speeds reaction times.** PROTOCOL - I think most people know l-theanine calms the caffeine's jitters, but I did NOT know how it kind of amplifies coffee's cognitive benefits. Good stuff.([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=2719s))
8. Drinking 2-3 cups of coffee daily **reduces diabetes risk by up to 60%.** SCIENCE - how? through AMPK activation. Key emphasis on UP TO 60%. Coffee is elite for metabolic health. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=481s))
9. **Robusta coffee delivers 60% higher levels of chlorogenic acids (this is the** primary antioxidant in coffee). Ok, ADVANCED PROTOCOL here - if you're trying to max your antioxidants from coffee, choose your beans wisely. Robusta > Arabica ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=1240s))
10. Get this Dave Asprey... **95% of coffee samples globally contain mold toxins far below safety limits.** And what do you know... roasting beans further reduces levels by 70‚Äì90%. Guy made a living on freaking people out about mold in coffee. smh. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=2363s))

1lcwg25,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1lcwg25/why_do_i_get_extreme_anxiety_over_my_new_puppy/,Why do I get extreme anxiety over my new puppy?,"I got my first puppy. 7 week old male german shepherd. Everything was going well. I played with him, gave hom a bath, cleaned his ears, fed him, extra. I put him in a play pen where he slept most of the day and only whined here and there but not a lot. Everything went down hill when I went to bed and around 12:20am the puppy woke up whining so i took him outside to potty brought him back he Whined for a bit then went back to sleep then he started whining again at 2:40am I got up again took him outside and brought him back but this time he wouldn't lay back down, kept trying to play and kept whining for about an hour until I had to put him outside in his play pen in the backyard because ibneeded to be up and get readyvfor work at 6am. The backyard is gated off and I kept the pouch light on for him. I felt guilty doing that because he kept crying. After I laid back down i couldn't go back to sleep. I started having extreme anxiety and I couldn't eat or drink anything for breakfast. Even trying to drink coffee made me want to vomit and I cried 2 twice that morning. I have family at home that looked after the puppy while i was gone at work. While I was at work I was still having anxiety all at work but it wasn't as intense as that night. When I got back home the puppy was a lot more calm. He didn't cry when you walked away from his play pen, he wasn't doing all that hollering like before. My dad said the puppy was whining for a bit then calmed down. I was able to eat dinner normally but that's all.

But the puppy isn't causing any problems and yet I'm still having this gut sinking feeling and idk why. My anxiety was still there even after the fact and when I went to bed I was having bad anxiety again but it wasn't as crazy as the pervious night but it was still pretty bad. I was able to eat a little bit and I still cried a bit. The puppy wasn't and haven't done anything bad and wasn't misbehaving so why am I still getting this feeling? I don't hate the puppy but I don't feel a connection with it either. I take care of him and I think he's cute but I don't love it and I feel bad... I always loved all animals but after I gotten this puppy I feel like I have been lying to myself. I want to keep him, I know it will get better after the puppy stages and the puppy haven't been a problem since the first night I got him but I still get this depressing anxiety feeling still even when I'm at work and away from him. I want to love him but I'm struggling with these feelings that won't go away.

1lcwehf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lcwehf,D202 in 8 Hours (Timeline),"Hello! Here‚Äôs how I completed it from first look to passing the test! 

Warning: Just because you know the terms does not mean you‚Äôll pass the test! They don‚Äôt just ask ‚ÄúWhat does ___ mean‚Äù on each question! They ask, Johnny thought that all crunchy snacks were crackers. Johnny received a crunchy snack and read the bag and saw the name ‚Äúchips‚Äù. According to ___ theory and accommodation, what will Johnny do with this information? Answer, because you should know what accommodation is: Johnny will note accept that not every crunchy snack is a cracker.‚Äù 

Because of this you have to read carefully and ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND what the definitions mean. But the instructors outdid themselves with the resources, so here‚Äôs my EXACT process. 

TOOLS :
1. Look in Course Tips and click the resources: There you will find: 
1. Link to the Instructors quiz let for each section
2. Link to powerpoint practice tests
3. Link to Unmuddy- D202 Study Guide

I only used 3 things. I did not rest the book because I have ADHD and as we all know WGU has a unique way of drawing out information that could‚Äôve been 6 words into a 20 word run on sentence with a video link attached. 


Step 1: Read through the entire Un Muddy Guide. There is a read aloud feature on the sheet. You don‚Äôt have to retain anything in this step, just pay attention to what you‚Äôre hearing and read along to familiarize yourself. 

Step 2: Quizzlet. 1- 1.5 Hours per section (there are 3). I did the matching game for most of that time so I can recognize the answer in multiple choice. If you have  paid Quizlet then you can just do the tests but I don‚Äôt. They do let you test once for free per section though so I suggest at the end of the hour do the test. After each session I got 97+% on the terms. I then combined them all and did one more round. 

Step 3: Took the pretest. This shocked me because of how the questions were asked but I still passed. I realized then I need to get more prepared for this type of questioning. Regardless my rule is if I pass then I set my test for 2 hours away and take the test. So I did that. 

Step 4: Found the 6 PowerPoints of questions. They are similar enough to the test although still vocabulary focused but now I‚Äôm just training my brain to know how to answer the questions. I also went over my pretest coaching report and quizzed myself. 

Step 5: Test! I went from barely passing and getting almost competent on 2 sections to over competent in all fields. 

That‚Äôs it that‚Äôs all! 

Things I regret: I took a caffeine pill at 12am. It‚Äôs equal to a cup of coffee. I wish i took it around maybe 8 before because I finished studying at 2am, Test was done around 4:30 & I had to work at 10 am‚Ä¶. Was up for an additional 2 hours trying to fall asleep and I still woke up with energy lol. So maybe I guess it‚Äôs a good thing I‚Äôm not tired yet?

1lcweb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lcweb7/im_not_sure_what_his_31m_intentions_with_me_are/,I‚Äôm not sure what his (31M) intentions with me are,"I am 23F in a situationship with 31M for 4 months. I am writing this post as I am confused about his intentions with me.

Firstly, the things that he does that make me think we are heading towards a relationship is: saying I love you, driving to see me in my city (1.5hr drive from him), talking about a future together, investing in me by buying me gifts (bags), paying for nails, letting me have his credit card, we lived together for a month before I had to move back home, he also told his best friend that I‚Äôm his soulmate.

But the things I‚Äôm confused with is: he said his life and job is too messed up for him to have a relationship, he recently accepted a job offer 8 hours away from me, he still is using dating apps and meeting up with girls on them (he has both hookup apps like tinder and serious apps like Coffee Meets Bagel and middle ones like hinge and bumble) he is active on all dating apps basically, he even books some paid services, and I saw he told his best friend he is single and not in a relationship even though our situationship has been for 4 months. He doesn‚Äôt even follow me on Instagram or any socials, but we are not very big social media people. He recently told me he is on a trip and will not be able to attend my birthday which made me really sad. He also recently told me there is no certainty in the future. Even though we talked about marrying, but he said that‚Äôs for the future and he can‚Äôt commit now. He said that 2 of his past relationships did not work out due to LDR, but now he is accepting a job that will make us long distance and it might cause our situationship not to work out.

Context: 1 month into meeting him and seeing him, his ex reached out to me to say she saw my number on his phone and told me his cheating escapades. She then broke up with him. But I asked him about the story and he said that his toxic life situation (parents divorce, stress etc) pushed him to cheat. He has cheated on 4 out of 4 of his ex-gfs but some are bc he had been hurt by women in general (2 of his ex-es cheated on him too).

Yesterday, I got sent some other screenshots of him hitting up girls on dating apps, booking escorts but I don‚Äôt know what to say because we are not together. He recently met his ex when he is on the trip. The screenshots showed that he has been trying to score dates or hookups while on that solo trip.

The part in most confused about is why , if he told his best friend he sees me as his soulmate, why can‚Äôt he commit to his soulmate?

Therefore, I‚Äôm very confused about his intentions, it seems like half of what he is doing sounds like he is serious but the other half sounds like he isn‚Äôt. Pls advise.",1,1750089023.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False
1lcweat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1lcweat/20_years_of_marriage/,20 years of marriage‚Ä¶,"Plus an additional 7 years (to decide to get married) marks 27 years that I have known and loved my husband. We don‚Äôt have biological children together but he helped raised my own 2 children and just recently, a long side my x-husband, walked their daughter down the aisle.  

Out of all of our friends, we are one of the last couples standing. Our friends refer to us as the couple who are like peanut butter and jelly, different-but better together. 

With that said, marriage is not easy even when it appears that way. We‚Äôve had our ups and downs but we‚Äôve always gotten through them and it‚Äôs something we‚Äôve prided ourselves on. 

A few years ago my husband was diagnosed with cancer.  It‚Äôs an incurable form of cancer, but one that can be treated and managed well into senior years.  One of the down sides is he tired all the time.  Doctors say it‚Äôs not the cancer, but we feel differently. 

So, I‚Äôve suggested some things he can do, such as eat healthier (the man literally wakes up in the middle of the night to eat candy). Drink more water, wear his cpap machine at night, but he won‚Äôt. He‚Äôs always been kind of ‚Äòlazy‚Äô when it comes to doing things that require planning and consistency.  And he has lots of excuses too.  

So, long story short he‚Äôs decided at the age of 50 to start doing drugs. I have found straws, lighters, tin foil lined with a filmy white substance.  I found crystal meth as well. He says he does it because he‚Äôs exhausted all the time. This is bad. 

And I know this because this is how I grew up.  I was sleeping in the hallways of apartment buildings to stay warm at the age of 15 due to addicted parents and later both of my siblings. My sister isn‚Äôt my sister anymore. I know what this shit does to people.

And here it is again, out of the blue, under my own roof, trying to take the man I have loved for over 2 decades.

What the actual Fck? 

He says he‚Äôs does it for a bit of energy because he‚Äôs so exhausted. He wont tell me where he gets it. He tells me he‚Äôll never do it again. He tells me our marriage is more important and he promises over and over and over that he‚Äôs done with it. 

And I want to believe him every single time. This is the third time I have caught him with it. I know how addiction works. 

I‚Äôve begged him to get help. He won‚Äôt get help because he said he is not addicted.

I love this man, I‚Äôm sad for him, but Im exhausted. Im out of things to say. 

So, I told him that it‚Äôs his body, it‚Äôs his money, it‚Äôs his choice and his consequences.  There is nothing else to say really. 

And then I woke up this morning, I did my normal routine, drank my coffee, thought my normal thoughts on what needs to get done for the day , and am carrying on like I have for the last 27 years in this marriage.  Except I‚Äôm not, not really.

I‚Äôm hoping someone here can help me troubleshoot a frustrating issue with my 3yo DeLonghi Magnifica Evo (model ECAM292.81.B).

A few weeks ago, I replaced the 3-way CEME solenoid valve (V301VN27P51A1X ‚Äì 230V AC / Type 558 / DN 2.7) because the machine stopped delivering coffee, although the hot water function still worked fine. Swapping the valve fixed the problem ‚Äî the coffee started flowing again immediately.

But after just 2 weeks of use, the same problem has returned:
	‚Ä¢	No water comes out of the coffee spout
	‚Ä¢	Hot Water still works perfectly
	‚Ä¢	No clicking sound (tac) from the solenoid valve when the coffee cycle starts
	‚Ä¢	I tried swapping the power wires (hot water ‚Üí coffee solenoid), and still no click = valve is dead again

This was a genuine CEME valve, not a cheap clone. I don‚Äôt understand how it could fail so fast. I‚Äôm wondering:
	1.	Could there be something wrong with the control board or power regulation?
	2.	Is the coil staying energized too long?
	3.	Could my new pump (also replaced recently because initially i stupidly thought that was the problem) be causing excess pressure or backflow into the valve?

Before I go buy another replacement (and risk it dying again), I‚Äôd really appreciate any insight or advice from folks who‚Äôve dealt with this.

Would love to just have someone there to talk to about it ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I‚Äôm into a variety of things, a bit geeky I suppose. Enjoy swimming and working out, action and sci fi movies, a good crime documentary, watching YT random videos. Love to cook as I‚Äôm on a health kick right now, baking, gaming-mostly call of duty but looking to expand. Love a coffee, house renovation/DIY, pick up trucks and a good whisky.

If you‚Äôre around my age, please feel free to say hi if youd like to connect. ",1,1750088709.0,gayfriendship,0,1.0,False

i was so happy! so i rushed there immediately. viktor started playing twenty one pilots and we waltzed romantically in his bedroom. 

i should have known it was too good to last so long.

midway into ""The Line"" i had the certain sensation of needing to shit. but i didn't want to ruin the moment, so i squeezed my asscheeks together tightly and continued dancing. things were going okay for a while, until viktor gave me some coffee. he said, ""for you my golden pookie wookie."" i was too touched not to drink it. so i gulped it down quickly.

i shouldn't have.

before the coffee had even settled, ny stomach rumbled and i started spurting golden shit everywhere. viktor was looking at me saying things like ""what the fuck"" and ""thats really gross mel"" and ""get on the fucking toilet"".

Everything was going well. I played with him, gave hom a bath, cleaned his ears, fed him, extra. I put him in a play pen where he slept most of the day and only whined here and there but not a lot. Everything went down hill when I went to bed and around 12:20am the puppy woke up whining so i took him outside to potty brought him back he Whined for a bit then went back to sleep then he started whining again at 2:40am I got up again took him outside and brought him back but this time he wouldn't lay back down, kept trying to play and kept whining for about an hour until I had to put him outside in his play pen in the backyard because ibneeded to be up and get readyvfor work at 6am. The backyard is gated off and I kept the pouch light on for him. I felt guilty doing that because he kept crying. After I laid back down i couldn't go back to sleep. I started having extreme anxiety and I couldn't eat or drink anything for breakfast. Even trying to drink coffee made me want to vomit and I cried 2 twice that morning. I have family at home that looked after the puppy while i was gone at work. While I was at work I was still having anxiety all at work but it wasn't as intense as that night. When I got back home the puppy was a lot more calm. He didn't cry when you walked away from his play pen, he wasn't doing all that hollering like before. My dad said the puppy was whining for a bit then calmed down. I was able to eat dinner normally but that's all.

But the puppy isn't causing any problems and yet I'm still having this gut sinking feeling and idk why. My anxiety was still there even after the fact and when I went to bed I was having bad anxiety again but it wasn't as crazy as the pervious night but it was still pretty bad. I was able to eat a little bit and I still cried a bit. The puppy wasn't and haven't done anything bad and wasn't misbehaving so why am I still getting this feeling? I don't hate the puppy but I don't feel a connection with it either. I take care of him and I think he's cute but I don't love it and I feel bad... I always loved all animals but after I gotten this puppy I feel like I have been lying to myself. I want to keep him, I know it will get better after the puppy stages and the puppy haven't been a problem since the first night I got him but I still get this depressing anxiety feeling still even when I'm at work and away from him. I want to love him but I'm struggling with these feelings that won't go away.

Whether someone wants to adopt him, or someone can suggest a place he can go to make friends, I'm all ears. Well, eyes. 

No throwaway because the whole point is to shamelessly bully my friend into going out into the world. (""But AC, I do go in the world""  - ""WITH OTHER PEOPLE""  - ""oh, right."") 

My friend, let's call him Stanley, he moved to the area about a year ago from halfway across the country. He didn't want to move, but he's a good dad and that's where his kids were going. There's an ex-wife in the area, they're friendly but they both happen to like women. He works from home, goes to the gym, and likes coffee. He is a special mix of arrogant and self-deprecating, a raging leftist, and so introverted it's mildly infuriating to be his friend sometimes. That's where I hope someone can swoop in with ideas. 

Stanley is one of my very favorite humans, and everything I know about him makes me want to know more. He reads non-fiction almost exclusively, subjects ranging wildly but always somehow on brand. His love of coffee is intense but not unhealthy (I grew up with 10potsaday parents so I know). His love for his children brings more light into this world every single day (and I have two bad dads so I know that too). He says what he means, but often not ALL of what he means. His heart lies within walls made of bricks and boxes, and my friendship with him is hard-won and deeply cherished. He makes the world a better place and I am better for knowing him, and I wish everyone he met could see what I do. 

When he first moved to where I live, halfway across the country, he was the same guy but married with babies. We worked together for months before anyone actually knew anything about him. At a work function I saw his ATLA tattoos and decided right there that he was going to be my friend and upon becoming his friend it was clear (and he admitted) that he needed socialization. I committed to bullying him relentlessly for months. Badgering, shaming, cajoling, name-calling, straight up emotional manipulation. I put WORK into this, and he will readily admit it was needed and necessary and good for him. First it was just the two of us and then I invited another coworker, and then they brought their wife, etc. It took a few years to find a solid group of friends here, and we miss him terribly. But we are HERE, and he is THERE, and there is no ME to make this happen again. 

So how does one find a friend for a friend? I've been on him for a year now to get out and make a friend or two but it isn't the same when I can't intimidate him with my 5'2"" fury and impressive mom glare. ",4,1750088426.0,Charleston,8,0.75,False

## What is Shift +70 Hiprex App?

Shift +70 Hiprex App is a **trading platform** that combines automation with customization. It lets users trade a variety of financial instruments like **cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks**, and even commodities. The app is built to cater to both **beginners** who want a hands-off experience and **experienced traders** looking for real-time data and control.

Think of it as your personal trading assistant that doesn‚Äôt sleep. It promises **real-time market insights**, customizable alerts, and auto-trading features that can execute trades while you‚Äôre grabbing coffee or binge-watching Netflix. While there are plenty of apps that make similar claims, Shift +70 Hiprex App stands out for how clean and simple it feels to use.

## Who Created Shift +70 Hiprex App?

That‚Äôs where things get a little fuzzy. The creators of Shift +70 Hiprex App haven‚Äôt made a huge splash publicly. There‚Äôs no flashy Elon-type figure behind the curtain, which is pretty common in trading apps like this. Based on what I could find, the platform appears to be backed by a team of **financial tech developers** and **algorithmic trading experts** who‚Äôve worked on similar systems.

While the lack of transparency might raise eyebrows, this isn‚Äôt unique. Apps like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge** had similar mystery beginnings. The important part is that it works ‚Äì and so far, Shift +70 Hiprex App seems to deliver on its core promises.

### [üî• Start Trading with Shift +70 Hiprex App Today](https://tinyurl.com/3aazzfju)
## How Does Shift +70 Hiprex App Work?

The app uses a mix of **algorithmic trading tools** and **manual input options**. At its core, it scans the markets using AI-driven tech to look for trends, price movements, and indicators that signal potential trades. If you enable auto-trading, the app can act on those signals for you ‚Äì buying or selling assets in real-time.

For folks who like to be more hands-on, you can disable the automation and use the app more like a **traditional trading platform**. It gives you charts, technical analysis tools, and even lets you set stop-losses and take-profit levels. You‚Äôre in charge of the risk level, which is great if you‚Äôre not ready to go full robot.

## Shift +70 Hiprex App Pros and Cons

Here‚Äôs what stood out to me, both the good and the not-so-great:

### Pros:
- **Beginner-friendly interface** ‚Äì even if you‚Äôve never traded before
- **Real-time market analysis** helps you stay informed
- **Supports multiple assets**, including crypto, stocks, and forex
- **Customizable alerts** keep you in the loop without staring at charts all day

### Cons:

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Shift +70 Hiprex App?

One of my favorite parts ‚Äì this thing runs on pretty much anything. You can use:

- **Desktop browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Android smartphones and tablets**
- **iPhones and iPads**

There‚Äôs no bulky software to download. The web app is lightweight but powerful. It adapts well to smaller screens, so if you‚Äôre trading on the go, the mobile experience doesn‚Äôt feel like a stripped-down version.

## Shift +70 Hiprex App ‚Äì Supported Countries

The app is **available in most countries**, but not all. Based on my research and testing, it works in:

- United Kingdom
- Australia
- Canada
- South Africa
- New Zealand
- Most of Europe

However, it‚Äôs **not available** (or restricted) in:

- United States
- Iran
- North Korea
- Some parts of Asia

Always double-check if your country is supported when signing up. Geo-restrictions are usually tied to local **financial regulations**.

## Shift +70 Hiprex App ‚Äì Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is the brain of the operation. The app constantly scans global markets using AI and machine learning. It identifies patterns and trends based on indicators like **RSI, MACD**, and **volatility swings**. You get actionable insights without having to do all the math yourself.

### User-Friendly Interface

I‚Äôve used a lot of trading platforms, and many are cluttered or overwhelming. Shift +70 Hiprex App is clean, minimalist, and easy to navigate. You can find what you need quickly ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs your portfolio, a new asset to trade, or the settings menu.

### Mobile Accessibility

The mobile version is surprisingly robust. You can manage trades, check alerts, make deposits and withdrawals ‚Äì all from your phone. Perfect for people who don‚Äôt want to be glued to a desktop.

### Customizable Alerts

Set alerts for price changes, news events, or technical signals. You can tailor notifications to fit your strategy so you're not bombarded with irrelevant updates.

### Multiple Asset Trading

You‚Äôre not limited to just crypto. The platform supports **stocks, forex, commodities**, and more. It‚Äôs a solid all-in-one solution if you like to diversify.

## Is Shift +70 Hiprex App a Scam?

This is the million-dollar question, right? Based on my experience and the research I‚Äôve done: **No, it‚Äôs not a scam**. It works as advertised, and I was able to deposit, trade, and withdraw funds without any weirdness.

That said, it connects you with **partner brokers**, and that‚Äôs where you need to be cautious. Always make sure the broker assigned to you is **licensed and regulated**. The app itself is legitimate, but not all third-party brokers are equal.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Shift +70 Hiprex App?

You‚Äôll need at least **$250** to get started. This is pretty standard for these types of platforms (same with Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge). It‚Äôs not pocket change, but also not outrageous. Just remember, don‚Äôt invest more than you can afford to lose ‚Äì especially when you‚Äôre still learning the ropes.

### Shift +70 Hiprex App Customer Support

Support is available **24/7**, and I tested it out with a few questions. Live chat responded quickly, and the rep seemed to know their stuff. You can also reach them via email if you prefer. No long wait times or canned responses ‚Äì which is rare these days.

## How do you start trading on Shift +70 Hiprex App?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official website, enter your name, email, and phone number. That‚Äôs it. You‚Äôll be redirected to a broker‚Äôs platform right after.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Upload your documents for verification (ID, proof of address), then make your **$250 deposit** using card, bank transfer, or crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once your account is funded, you can dive into manual or automated trading. Set your preferences, choose your assets, and start trading.

## How to Delete a Shift +70 Hiprex App Account?

If you want to walk away, contact customer support. They‚Äôll **close your account** and ensure your data is wiped. It‚Äôs not instant, but it‚Äôs straightforward. Make sure you withdraw any funds first.

It‚Äôs not the best supermarket out there. Some things are worth getting, because they‚Äôre cheaper than other places - but some things there are simply terrible. 

For instance, most of the time I give any frozen prepared meat there a side eye. Because every time I‚Äôve bought frozen prepared foods with meat it‚Äôs been horrible quality, or it had gone bad already. 

The prepared sandwiches and stuff are bad. Every time I‚Äôve had a sandwich there it‚Äôs been the low end of ok. 

I‚Äôm not even a picky eater, I‚Äôve had prepared fast food better than what they try to sell you at Trader Joe‚Äôs. 

The bakery products, if they‚Äôre not already expired, will not last long even though they‚Äôre supposed to last a couple days. 

I once found a wall of yogurt there that had already been expired 9 days. I pointed it out and the manager who was in process of putting them on the shelf feigned horror, ‚Äúoh I had no idea!‚Äù You‚Äôre supposed to have an idea though. 

The Halloween candy that was supposed to be like snickers? Trash 

I like their frozen vegetables, and I will get their carbonated water. The coffee is pretty good, and the dried fruit and nuts are nice. The whole snack aisle is usually a good bet. 

I honestly think TJs should be marketed as a more dry convenience kind of store though, because prepared meals they‚Äôre just awful at. 

Edit: for those saying you should say where IS best, you‚Äôre taking me too literally. It‚Äôs a phrase like ‚Äúthese fries aren‚Äôt the best‚Äù means they kinda suck.

I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for two years He‚Äôs amazing kind thoughtful and honestly someone I could see a future with We‚Äôve been talking about living together for a while now and he finally brought up the idea of me moving into his place

Here‚Äôs the thing I LOVE my current apartment It‚Äôs tiny but it‚Äôs mine It‚Äôs five minutes from my work the coffee shop downstairs knows my order and I‚Äôve made it so cozy it actually feels like home I‚Äôve lived here for three years and the thought of giving it up makes me feel‚Ä¶ weirdly emotional

His place is nicer and bigger for sure but it‚Äôs in a busier area I‚Äôd have a longer commute and I‚Äôd be giving up my independence in a way I‚Äôve never done before Plus he‚Äôs a bit messy and I‚Äôm super tidy so I‚Äôm lowkey afraid I‚Äôll turn into a nag

That said rent would be cheaper if we split and we‚Äôd see each other more and yeah I miss him when we‚Äôre not together But I also kinda love living alone

So what would you do?  
Option A: Move in with him and give this a real shot  
Option B: Stay in my apartment a little longer and revisit the idea later

Please help me make the choice because I‚Äôm losing sleep over this",1,1750088057.0,makemychoice,11,0.67,False
1lcvyh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok_Health_8840/comments/1lcvyh2/a_fairly_rare_gene_combo/,A Fairly Rare Gene Combo,"My genetic makeup is a collision of evolutionary extremes, a blend of traits so rare and contradictory that they defy modern biological norms.

I'll break down the genes, the trade-offs, and the data behind what makes this combination both a *superpower* and a *burden*.

*For anyone with a genuine interest in this specific mix - I can provide my raw DNA data. (Just don't clone me! Kidding.)*

**The Warrior Gene (rs4680 GG):**¬†This variant in the¬†*COMT*¬†gene is notorious for its link to¬†**stress resilience**¬†and¬†**pain tolerance**. By rapidly breaking down dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, it keeps the mind sharp under pressure but leaves little room for relaxation.

Imagine a brain wired for battlefields, not boardrooms. Studies suggest this genotype thrived in ancient warrior cultures where split-second decisions meant survival. Today, it means staying cool in crises but struggling to ‚Äúswitch off‚Äù when the adrenaline fades.

**Metabolic Overdrive (gs164 Positive + gs156c Positive):**¬†These SNPs crank metabolism to¬†about **2.5x the human average**, maybe a little more actually, forcing me to consume¬†**5,000+ daily calories**¬†just to stay at 165-170 lbs.

For context, that‚Äôs equivalent to Michael Phelps‚Äô peak Olympic diet.

Evolutionarily, this trait likely emerged in environments where food scarcity demanded rapid energy conversion. Modern life turns this into a logistical nightmare: ***miss a meal, and my body cannibalizes muscle within hours.***

**Hybrid Muscle Fibers (rs1815739 TC):**¬†The¬†*ACTN3*¬†gene variant creates about a¬†**55/45 split of fast-twitch (sprint) and slow-twitch (endurance) fibers**.

Most people skew heavily toward one type, but this balance allows explosive power¬†*and*¬†sustained effort, think sprinting up a hill and then hiking 10 miles (but unfortunately I also have a few mutations that lower my endurance). Paired with my¬†**congenital pain insensitivity (rs121908908 GG)**, it‚Äôs a recipe for pushing past limits, but also for ignoring injuries until they become *severe*. - I've got plenty of burn scars to prove that one.

**Cognitive Enhancements:**

* **Memory (rs17070145 TC):**¬†This¬†*KIBRA*¬†polymorphism enhances¬†**episodic memory**, particularly under stress. It‚Äôs like having a mental DVR that records high-pressure moments in detail. Sometimes it feels like MOST of my memories with any real vividity are like this. ""Normal life"" feels hazy and bland when recollected. This can lead to chasing a ""memory high"" in a way.
* **Time Perception:**¬†While not directly linked to a single SNP, the combination of rapid dopamine clearance and heightened memory creates a subjective¬†**‚Äútime dilation‚Äù effect**. Seconds feel like minutes in crises, allowing hyper-detailed situational analysis. Because of my being built to be active, stimulated, this effect is near-constant. Combine this with a much lower average of sleep time over my life than the average person, and I've ""lived longer"" or ""more"" in the same period of time as someone the same age.
* **Intelligence & Longevity (rs9536314 TG):**¬†Linked to¬†**higher general cognitive ability**¬†and¬†**increased lifespan**, this SNP suggests a brain built for strategic, long-term thinking.

***The Quirks:***

* **Caffeine Sensitivity (rs762551 AC):**¬†As a slow metabolizer, coffee hits harder and lingers longer, useful for focus, disastrous for sleep.
* **Bitter Taste (rs713598 CG + rs10246939 TC):**¬†Hyper-sensitive to bitter compounds, a trait that once prevented poison ingestion but now makes vegetables like kale taste like chemicals.
* **Height (rs1042725 TC + rs6060369 CC):**¬†Adds¬†**\~1.28 cm (0.5 inches)**¬†through genes regulating growth plates.

**The Rarity:**  
Individually, these SNPs aren‚Äôt all unique on their own. It varies.

For example:

* **Warrior Gene (GG):**¬†Around 20-25% of Europeans according to some studies.
* **ACTN3 TC:**¬†30-40% globally.
* **Pain Insensitivity (GG):**¬†<0.001% of the population. (Extremely rare)

But the¬†**concurrent presence of** ***all*** **these traits,** plus the metabolic overclock, is statistically¬†**vanishingly rare**.

Geneticists estimate this specific combination occurs in¬†**<1 in 50,000 people**. Looking at loads different data, and coming to my own conclusion, it's more accurate to say even <1 in 250,000 people.

To put that in perspective, you‚Äôre more likely to get struck by lightning twice (possibly even 5 times) than share my genetic profile when it comes to these genes.

**Evolutionary Origins: Survival Over Serenity**  
These genes paint a picture of a human optimized for¬†**short-term survival in brutal environments (but NOT the world of today)**:

1. **Warrior Gene:**¬†Thrived in hunter-gatherer bands under constant threat.
2. **Hybrid Muscles:**¬†Ideal for both ambush hunting and multi-day migrations.
3. **Hypermetabolism:**¬†Critical in Arctic climates or famine conditions.

But nature doesn‚Äôt care about modern comfort.

The same traits that kept ancestors alive now clash with desk jobs and processed foods.

Needing 5,000 calories daily isn‚Äôt just inconvenient, it‚Äôs a full-time job. Pain insensitivity risks joint damage from overtraining. Even the dopamine dysregulation means everyday relaxation feels foreign without extreme physical or mental exertion.

**The Modern Paradox**  
Living with this genome is a study in contradictions:

* **Strength vs. Sustainability:**¬†Muscles recover fast but demand *constant* fuel.
* **Focus vs. Burnout:**¬†Stress resilience comes at the cost of *chronic tension*.
* **Pain Resistance vs. Self-Destruction:**¬†Ignoring injuries leads to long-term *damage*.

In emergencies, the body and mind shift into a gear most can‚Äôt access. It‚Äôs a biological ‚Äúoverdrive‚Äù button, but one that can‚Äôt be pressed without consequences.

This genetic blueprint isn‚Äôt better or worse, it‚Äôs¬†*different*. A relic of evolutionary pressures that shaped humans for survival, not comfort.

For those of us carrying these variants, life becomes a balancing act: leveraging rare strengths while mitigating ancient trade-offs.

As science unlocks more secrets of the genome, perhaps we‚Äôll learn to harness these traits without the burnout.

Until then, pass the peanut butter..... I‚Äôve got 2,000 calories left to hit today.",1,1750088015.0,u_Ok_Health_8840,0,1.0,False

My routine post-roast QC discovered exactly zero quakers and three shells in the 2500g.
Hacea green is consistently of this type of quality from roast to cup, and not only does it save time at QC, easily finished during routine BBP without pause, I'm confident sharing their roasted beans with my most seasoned aficionados. 
They green they curate have never failed me and I always anxiously look forward to to savoring each rested nugget. 
I've been buying from them since my first couple of roasts and I feel spoiled, since I have never had the QC quandaries and disgusts I have heard mentioned here and elsewhere.

My surgeons instructions were to just not touch anything for 5 days - No shower or taking off bra or anything. Today I get my drains out and I feel like I‚Äôm gonna enter a new phase of recovery. SO for anyone with the same post op instructions as me this list might be helpful for you for the first phase!

**SUPPORT TEAM**

* **First day:** I needed support for literally everything. Moving out of bed, wiping after using the bathroom, putting on clothes, picking up my water cup, holding my plate so I could eat, sponge bathing in the morning and at night. Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt mind too much because I was still kind of drugged up.¬†I wasn't in too much pain, I was just unable to move enough to do this stuff.
* **Second day:** I was able to move to the couch and could get to the toilet alone although it was painful to bend enough to wipe. I needed help making food but could support the plate on my own. Still needed help with sponge bathing. Also, by this point, I probably could‚Äôve done my own drains, but I was too squeamish so I continued getting help with this until the end.
* **Third day:** Kinda felt miraculous how I just woke up this day and quickly I was able to do a lot on my own. I needed help lifting anything heavyish like my Stanley cup or reaching up high but I was able to do most things by myself and be left alone during the day. I still needed help getting ready in the morning and getting ready for bed at night. I had my mom takeout my braids and brush and rebraid my hair¬†
* **Fourth day:** I desperately needed to leave the house for my mental health but couldn‚Äôt move my arms enough to drive. So my husband took me out for a short drive to get some coffee and go through a drive-through. I needed help that evening with a sponge bath but was mostly independent by this point!
* **Fifth day:** From this point on I felt¬† independent. Could brush and do my hair, feed my cats, feed myself. It was great! It took everything in me to NOT to push myself. It was nice to have a support team around still to remind me to not do too much and continue to let my body heal.

**SELF CARE**

* **Write EVERYTHING down.** My memories were foggy the first few days from the anesthesia and medication and with multiple people helping me it was hard to keep track of who did what. I kept a log of the times I took my medicine, drainage, pain level, and my temperature. All of these were super helpful to have written down.

**FOOD/DRINK**

* **Gingerale and Seltzer.** Essential for nausea.
* **Bendy Straws.** Changes the game and makes you much more independent.
* **Comfort Food.** The first day I didn‚Äôt have much of an appetite but toward the evening I enjoyed some soup. Throughout recovery I thought I would want light food like soups and pudding, but turns out I was really craving hearty comfort food like mashed potatoes and burgers. It might be a good idea to get some frozen ready-made meals that are easy to heat up. Or prepare to DoorDash a lot.

1. Calling up a friend or family member and just talking nonsense for a while

2. Putting on a stream from YouTube, twitch, etc and lying under a heavy or weighted blanket

3. Long walk in nature. Sometimes multiple walks around a city park. Only helps me if I dont have music running

4.  Something small but measurable and achievable. Might be following through on a recipe to make cookies, measurable progress in a video game that isn't too difficult, deep cleaning a room. If i can say I accomplished something measurable that day, it staves off the feeling of ""you arent useful"", which is a big anxiety thing for me...especially when I have job anxiety. 

5. Heavy exercise. Weights, or running until im very tired.  

6. Lying down somewhere im not supposed to lie down. Like on the floor, or grass outside. Or sitting somewhere i dont normally sit, like a park bench

7. I cut back on coffee, weed, alcohol. All three Contributed to my anxiety. 

8. Anything creative, and its ok if im bad. I've written grotesquely poor poetry, I cant sing well usually. But sometimes its fun being bad at something. Life isn't about min/maxing , and I think thats where my anxiety comes from. Ill try a hobby and im bad at it, and I get frustrated.

1lcvuor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1lcvuor/just_be_quiet/,Just be quiet‚Ä¶,"When I wake up in the morning, I need at least 20 minutes, after I open my eyes, where I don‚Äôt have to talk to anyone and no one talks to me. I can smoke my morning cigarette (I know, nasty habit, bite me) and drink my coffee in peaceful silence. 

I rarely ever get to do that since my babygirl wakes up pretty much as soon as I get out of the bed, unless I decide to wake up a little earlier than usual, then she‚Äôll stay sleeping sometimes. But I don‚Äôt ever wake up early bc I‚Äôm always exhausted and if I‚Äôm being honest, just a little bit lazy. 

But this morning I forced myself. The one morning I actually get my ass out of bed to hopefully complete my morning ritual. 

I carefully got out of bed, opened my bedroom door, peaked my head out into the hallway and heard silence in the rest of the house. Almost giddy with anticipation, I quietly made my way to the kitchen, made my coffee and grabbed my cigarettes, excitedly tip toed to the back door, opened the sliding glass door, took one step out onto the back patio and what do I see? My mother in law.

Now I don‚Äôt mind this woman, most of the time, MOST OF THE TIME. We actually have a pretty decent relationship. The problem with her is that she talks‚Ä¶ALL THE TIME. She‚Äôs a talker. I mean, she doesn‚Äôt need a prompt or an invitation, she doesn‚Äôt even need an audience.  Sometimes she doesn‚Äôt even take a breath while she‚Äôs talking. And she doesn‚Äôt just talk about one thing, she jumps from one subject to another so fast your head will spin. I mean sometimes it‚Äôs so bad that you literally have to just walk away while she‚Äôs in the middle of talking.

It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if you could actually have a conversation with her. But she also fits snuggly into a category of people that I call ‚Äúone-uppers‚Äù. You know the people I‚Äôm talking about‚Ä¶no matter what anyone says in conversation‚Ä¶if you did something, these people have done it too, but better. If you had something bad or traumatic happen to you, they‚Äôve had it worse. If you were sick for a week, they were sick for a month. If something good happened to you, they‚Äôre gonna tell you what happened to them and it‚Äôs gonna be better. 

No matter what, they always steer the conversation back to them. Thinking that maybe I was being too hard on her, I‚Äôve tried multiple times to really have a conversation with her. We‚Äôre talking multiple times over the 7 years I‚Äôve been with my husband. And it happens every. single. time. 

Sometimes I‚Äôll try to just power through and ignore the fact that she makes everything about her in some form or fashion but I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that it‚Äôll never happen. And there‚Äôs no use in telling her about herself because people don‚Äôt change. Not really anyway‚Ä¶sure our opinions may change over time maybe even some personality traits change but who we are inherently at our core, that doesn‚Äôt change. And her jibber jabber is just a part of who she is. She is who she is and there‚Äôs no changing her.

I‚Äôm new to having thyroid issues & just started on medication (Levo) and I need advice. 

I started my medication over 2 weeks ago & it like it started working immediately. I wasn‚Äôt lethargic anymore, the daily lightheadness/headaches went away but after a week on it i started getting the lightheadedness/headaches again just not as severe. The lethargy hasn‚Äôt come back but now every few days i have a weird lump feeling in my throat. Lasts about 30 minutes when it does happen then goes away. 

I have my 1st appointment since starting the medication in 3 weeks but i was wondering if anyone has advice or has had this happen to them too. 

I should mentioned that i am a daily coffee drinker, i have seen something in the reddit community that coffee intake can affect it.

Any advice is very appreciated!

1lcvpm9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lcvpm9,Picky Eater,"First post here, meet Kimora! 

History: found in 2021 hiding by some dumpsters. Emaciated. No chip or collar, signs put up, no one called. She stayed with her rescue family until it was clear the other dogs in the household would not integrate with her. When I adopted her in 2022 I was warned that she does not eat a lot and tends to scatter the food around the bowl, perhaps because she previously experienced food scarcity. Shows typical signs of prior abuse. 

The night before I came to meet her she had a major bloody stool accident, which was a first. Diagnosed with pancreatitis. Kept her at adoptive home for a few more days while I visited with her. Told she must be on an ultra low fat diet for the rest of her life. 

The first year she ate a combination of ID dog food and home meals such as rice, chicken, eggs, etc.  Over time I came to believe the stomach issues were more a result of stress. The only accidents she's ever had have been after I've gotten a dog sitter and blood was never involved. She has never been food motivated. I have no issue setting out appetizers on the coffee table -- cured meats, cheese, crackers, etc. -- and she might be curious but does not eat what is not given to her. At night I'll often share my snacks with her, mostly carrots and blueberries. She stops when she doesn't want anymore.  

The last month in particular she has become incredibly finicky. The last full meal I was able to get her to eat was 2 days ago: rice, ground beef with egg mixed in and a little cheese on top. She only ate it because I hand fed it to her. Yesterday I put nut milk in her bowl, then kibble to make a kind of cereal. It is still sitting in the bowl. Last night I boiled chicken and put a little low fat sour cream on it. She smelled it and walked away. I often leave a bowl of dry kibble out which will more or less sit untouched until I get rid of it. 

I've started putting food out then putting it back in the fridge because otherwise it will sit so long it goes bad. 

There have been no recent change in circumstances. She was 68lbs when I adopted her and now weighs closer to 80lb. She runs 3-5 times a day, the days she runs fewer times she has other stimulation like long walks, guests, car rides, etc. She defecates at least once a day which appear healthy and normal. It goes without saying she does not eat or tear up nonedible items. She gets treats when I leave the house, in the morning a dental treat, evening peanut butter with her meds, and about 3 days a week she gets a treat that takes longer to chew down. I've started restricting that to the dental treat and peanut butter with meds to no avail. 

OK I think I covered everything. Thoughts? Suggestions? Thanks!

It was a journey that tested my conviction, pushed me to the edge of sanity, and forced me to confront my own strengths and weaknesses. And yet, it was precisely in those darkest moments that I discovered the true meaning of entrepreneurial resilience.

As a founder, I've witnessed the highs and lows, the crushing disappointments and the triumphant breakthroughs. I've seen partners come and go, investors pull the plug, and the market shift beneath our feet. But through it all, I've come to realize that the true test of an entrepreneur's mettle lies not in the initial vision or the first dollar raised, but in the ability to adapt, to pivot, and to persevere in the face of uncertainty.

For us, it started with an idea for a platform that would revolutionize the way industries collaborated. We worked tirelessly to build a solution that would disrupt the status quo, only to discover that the market wasn't ready. It took us several months of listening to customers, refining our approach, and re-tooling our product before we finally found the sweet spot. And even then, it wasn't smooth sailing.

But that's what it means to be an entrepreneur: embracing the chaos, navigating the unknown, and trusting in your own instincts. It's a journey that requires vulnerability, creativity, and a willingness to learn from failure. And when the doubters and the naysayers try to sway you off course, it's a reminder that success is not about being right, but about being willing to take the leap, to trust in yourself, and to keep pushing forward.

So to all the entrepreneurs out there, the ones who are still building, still grinding, and still chasing their dreams: I see you, I hear you, and I believe in you. Let's keep pushing the boundaries, breaking the mold, and rewriting the rules. The world needs more of your passion, your creativity, and your unwavering commitment.",1,1750087156.0,u_Helpful_ruben,0,1.0,False
1lcvkfd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lcvkfd,Had my ECM Synchronika for a year now. Zero regrets.,"I had a Gaggia Pro for 7 years prior to buying this machine. My first duel-boiler to own. Got tired of waiting for the temp to alter on my single boiler for espresso pulls / frothing milk. Worse when we‚Äôd have people come over. And I didn‚Äôt do the best descaling at first like I should have. Started to kill my Gaggia. This thing does take about 12 minutes to heat up fully to use. But once it‚Äôs heated, I never have to wait making multiple espresso pulls or milk froths. I hooked up a Kasa Smart Home Switch to it, so I can turn it off via my phone before walking into the kitchen. Also have it turn on in the mornings before I get ready for work. 

I definitely made sure to install a proper water filter for the Synchronika. Went with BWT. It‚Äôs a must imo. Hooking up the filter is fairly easy once you find the correct fittings connecting the French side for the filter fitting into a US fitting for the water line. I used the 3/8 water line behind my fridge. 

I did get too large of a BWT Bestmax Water Filter Cartridge, originally got a medium sized (handles about 585 liters). Just replaced the filter with a small sized one. (Filters about 290 liters) If my wife drank as much coffee as I did, the medium is definitely better for two daily heavy consumers.

Also installed a BWT Aquameter to see exactly how much water we‚Äôve used. Over the course of a year, 298 litters (9,840 ounces) went through the filter. About 1,640 cups of coffee (4oz espresso + 2oz water). I usually make 1-2 cups a day. My wife might have a latte 2 times a week or so. And we housed many parties or I‚Äôd always make something for people visiting often. The medium filter did a great job for all this combined before still was overkill. 

The only thing that I‚Äôd had to replace over 1-year was the BWT Water Pressure Reducer. Hard water hits it before the filter does its thing. Our slightly higher house pressure and our hard water just killed it though. Maybe it was defective. Unsure. If it‚Äôs the only part I end up replacing each year, I‚Äôm ok with it though. 

Broke even already with how much money I‚Äôd spend buying coffee from the local coffee places though. Been considering getting into roasting my own beans next. Just need to learn more over it and dive in. :)

Anyhow, wanted to just give some quick thoughts. Posted a pic with some of my favorite coffees too. Any other bean recommends also much appreciated. Post any questions you have and I‚Äôll answer the best I can. ",17,1750087123.0,espresso,8,0.95,False
1lcvk87,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1lcvk87/new_light_on_disfellowshipped_ones_my_ass/,New Light On Disfellowshipped Ones My Ass!,"Did you know in 1974 at the District Convention the Society got ""New Light"" on how to treat Disfellowshipped ones? They relaxed their stand and you could have limited association with them but this was all changed and removed yet again in 1981.

Here is the truth about their ""New Light""

My wife Debbie loved her real father, Robert Stillman, more than anything, even though he was dis-fellowshipped and lived three thousand miles away. The best times in her young life were with her father and not her mother. What a surprise.

However, if Debbie even said her father‚Äôs name in front of Elaine, she would get her face slapped. Bob left Debbie‚Äôs psycho mother back in the 1950s and married another woman. He was, of course, dis-fellowshipped. It was his only way out of his nasty marriage.

Say you are a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness, and you are in a really bad marriage. There is physical, emotional and maybe even sexual abuse going on. For many years, there was only one way to get out of this kind of hell: Someone had to commit adultery. That‚Äôs right. Of course, you could get a divorce for any reason. You just couldn‚Äôt get remarried unless one of you committed adultery. For decades, it has been the¬†*Society‚Äôs*¬†only provision that would allow you to get remarried.

Believe it or not there was a time when that was ONLY allowed if you had sex with someone of the opposite sex.

How about sex with someone of the same sex? Divorce was NOT allowed.

How about sex with farm animals? Divorce was NOT allowed.

For many years, sex with someone of¬†*different sex*¬†was the only¬†*scriptural grounds*¬†for divorce and the only way to get out of a totally toxic marriage.

Of course, this sounds crazy!

Kool-Aid, anyone?

This¬†*new light*¬†came out while I was at Bethel. In the Watchtower, Jan 1, 1972 issue, pp.31-32, a reader asked this question:¬†*Do homosexual acts on the part of a married person constitute scriptural grounds for divorce, freeing the innocent mate to remarry?*

This¬†*new light*¬†will blow your mind. The Societies‚Äô answer to the question was this:

*‚ÄúWhether an innocent mate would scripturally be able to remarry after procuring a legal divorce from a mate guilty of homosexual acts must be determined on the basis of what the Bible says (or what our current interpretation is) respecting divorce and remarriage. In homosexual acts, the sex organs are used in an unnatural way, in a way for which they were never purposed. Two persons of the same sex are not complements of each other, as Adam and Eve were. They could never become ‚Äúone flesh‚Äù in order to procreate. It might be added, in the case of human copulation with a beast, two different kinds of flesh are involved. Wrote the apostle Paul: ‚ÄòNot all flesh is the same flesh, but there is one of mankind, and there is another flesh of cattle, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish.‚Äô‚Äî1 Cor. 15:39. While both homosexuality and bestiality are disgusting perversions, in this case NEITHER ONE IS THE MARRIAGE TIE BROKEN. It is broken only by acts that make an individual ‚Äúone flesh‚Äù with a person of the opposite sex other than his or her legal marriage mate.‚Äù*

Wow, there you have it. Your mate could be having sex with farm animals, but that does not break the marriage tie. So according to the wisdom and guidance from the from¬†*god's organization*, a¬†*good*¬†Christian wife would have share her marriage bed with a goat or another man, if her husband wanted a threesome. With no recourse to her but comply.

You can't make this stuff up folks.

A few years later, guess what? After thousands of people‚Äôs lives were destroyed by the societies‚Äô toxic¬†*new light,*¬†the Society changed its tune once again. What a surprise. Now you can get a divorce and remarry if your mate had sex with someone of the same sex or with farm animals.

Yes, the¬†*new light*¬†kicked in once again and canceled out the old¬†*new light*. What do you think? Was it god who changed his mind once again? Or maybe god has nothing to do with the insanity that this organization puts out there!

Welcome to the¬†*Twilight Zone.*

So, is it and surprise the society is doing everything in its power to get rid of all these older publications from public records. So people can't research the¬†*new light*¬†and the¬†*old new light.*

Of Course sadly, many of the people who are dis-fellowshipped for adultery every year are not the abusers in the relationship. They are the victims. The abuser doesn‚Äôt want to leave god‚Äôs¬†*loving organization*¬†by divorcing their spouse. So, what they do is pretty much drive their spouse into adultery. This has happened thousands of times over the years. Is there mercy for the victims of this kind of abuse? No, the rules are clear; so, in the vast majority of cases these victims are dis-fellowshipped and shunned. Leaving the abuser in¬†*good standing.*

After being dis-fellowshipped, the poor victims who what back into the insanity must to sit in the back of the Kingdom Hall for months or even years, waiting to be reinstated and accepted back into¬†*god‚Äôs loving fold.*¬†The adulterer doesn‚Äôt have to wear a large scarlet letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù on their clothes but, they might as well for how they are treated.

Moving right along. If we look at the story of my Father-in-Law Bob and his crazy wife Elaine, I‚Äôd say Bob made the right move in the question of staying married to Elaine or getting dis-fellowshipped. He dumped a bad marriage and a bad religion all in one move. Happy ending for Bob? No, because it would cost him his relationship with his only two children Debbie and Mike and of course all of his grandchildren.

A short time after her divorce to Bob, Elaine married Ben, and they moved 1,500 miles away to Ruston, Louisiana. After the move, she made Debbie and her brother write a letter to Bob. The letter said they had no desire to see him ever again. That was their mother‚Äôs idea, of course, sweet woman that she was. For poor Bob, it probably looked like this was his only future with his Jehovah‚Äôs Witness children.

Fast forward ten years and Bob would be getting a break in 1974, with this wonderful¬†*new light*¬†we got at the district convention.

After Roy‚Äôs wedding we drove to my parents‚Äô house in Southern California. From there we went to San Jose for the long awaited reunion with Debbie‚Äôs Father.

Debbie was so excited to see her father, who she loved so much. The love I saw between those two was amazing. When they met, it was like a scene out of a movie. Father and daughter united again in love, after all these years. I found him to be a very sweet and kind person, nothing like Debbie‚Äôs psycho mother.

How strange to be sitting in his living room while we were showing Bob and his wife Donna a slide show of our wedding pictures. Bob had this big smile on his face, smoking his pipe. He was seeing his own daughter‚Äôs wedding for the first time‚Äîthe wedding he was banished from and wasn‚Äôt even invited to attend.

I wondered what Donna was thinking. I‚Äôm sure she must have thought we were sick and sadistic people. We didn‚Äôt invite this poor man to his only daughter‚Äôs wedding. Then we came into their home and showed him the pictures of a wedding from which he was shunned.

I‚Äôm sure Donna couldn‚Äôt wait to join Bob‚Äôs old religion. The religion that brags about how much love they have for everyone.

We spent a whole week at their house. I‚Äôm sure Debbie was looking forward to having a relationship again with her long-lost father. I was looking forward to having a real father-in-law and not Ben the village idiot.

After we left Bob‚Äôs house, we had been in California for almost a month. We then headed to Idaho to see Gary Kennedy and his wife Ann Marie. Then we headed east again. After two months on the road, we were back in Rhode Island. We were broke and heading into our first New England winter with little to no work.

In 1976, Bob and Donna came to Rhode Island to see us. Debbie and her brother really put the sale on him to come back into¬†*the truth*¬†and the home of the¬†*new light.*¬†He just couldn‚Äôt do it. I think he was afraid. He was afraid that if he screwed up again, the love would be yanked away from him one more time. As it turned out, he would have been right. Plus, Donna hated Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses for some odd reason. So how does one choose between his kids or his wife? This hell is experienced by many people in the same circumstances.

We had moved into a small bungalow across the street from Indian Lake. Bob and Donna parked their travel trailer on our property and stayed with us for over a month. We had a great time together during that visit. Bob and Donna left and headed back to California.

Debbie had grown up in Ruston and had known many people there. The two people who proved to be like parents to Debbie as she was growing up were JoAnn and Jack Needham, who basically started the Farmerville Congregation. I must say, I loved Jack Needham, too. I wasn‚Äôt real close to my MIA non-Jehovah‚Äôs Witness father. So, Jack was the closest thing I had to a real father.

Jack always had a smile on his face. He looked quite dapper with his grey hair and handle-bar mustache. He looked just like a Royal Air Force pilot. Come to find out, he had been in the RAF during the war.

Jack was a rebel, and he would receive more flack later on in life because he refused to shave his mustache. I found out later the only reason he had a mustache was to cover up some nasty scars he got from his plane crash in the war. Beards or mustaches weren‚Äôt allowed in the Society back then if you wanted to be an Elder or a Pioneer. Jack broke their rules about that, but they still made him an Elder. He was his own man.

The rules at Bethel are: you are allowed mustaches if you are Black, but no beards. If you are white, mustaches and beards aren‚Äôt allowed, period. Until the ""new light"" that is.

Anyway back to the Debbie and Bob reunion.

Debbie and I bought a little 1920s‚Äô bungalow on Bernice Street in Farmerville.

In 1978, Bob came to Louisiana to visit us and our daughter, Kelly, his first grandchild. Because of the new policy changes, Bob was even allowed to go to his own son‚Äôs wedding in a Kingdom Hall in Louisiana.

Yes, the¬†*new light*¬†would allow for that sort of kindness now. This¬†*new light*¬†seemed very reasonable. Back then, I thought, who knows? - Maybe Jehovah is really directing things back at the headquarters.

At his son Mike‚Äôs wedding, Bob told Elaine what a great job she did in raising their children. It looked like maybe my church could be kind, loving and forgiving at times now.

But all good things come to an end. Just like the policy of sex with farm animals and divorce, god had changed his mind once again about how to deal with those who are dis-fellowshipped.

A few years later, the¬†*light got brighter.*¬†In 1981, the Society said we were going back to the ‚Äúold way‚Äù or the ‚Äú*old new light,*‚Äù which was not the¬†*‚Äúnew light‚Äù*¬†they received back in 1974. This¬†*new light*¬†would, of course, cancel out the¬†*old new light*¬†of dealing with those who are dis-fellowshipped. We were all told we had to go back to the old way of dealing with dis-fellowshipped people by shunning them and treating them like dead people once again. This¬†*new light*¬†is still enforced to this very day.

Personally, I think and I'm just guessing, that this¬†*new light*¬†change about of how we delt with dis-fellowshipped ones, was because of what had happened to Ray Franz at Bethel. The timing was exactly the same.

The society didn't want anyone talking to people like Ray and the many others that left Bethel with him. These people had information that could seriously destroy the society's creditability. Of course they couldn't say you could have limited association with some dis-fellowshipped ones but not others. So, of course they went back to the old way of shunning everyone who left.

This policy would ending up destroying thousands of people's lives and my Father in-law Bob would be one of them.

One day in 1981, Bob called us up. We were living in Oregon then. Bob said he wanted to come up to Oregon for a visit, to see us and his only grandkids, my children. Poor Bob didn‚Äôt know about the¬†*new light*¬†yet.

I said, ‚ÄúCome on up Bob. We would love to see you.‚Äù Debbie grabbed the phone out of my hand and told him that he wasn‚Äôt welcome anymore and that he couldn‚Äôt come up for anymore visits.

Bob was, of course, very upset with the organization‚Äôs¬†*new light.*¬†This meant that he would be losing his family once again. For many years, he wasn‚Äôt allowed to see his own children. Then the Society gave him his family back. But now they had taken his family away from him for good.

Debbie wouldn‚Äôt talk or see him anymore, but thoughtful my wife did send her father a subscription to¬†*The Watchtower and Awake magazines*. So now, at least twice a month, Bob would receive¬†*spiritual food*¬†in the mail from the people who kept taking his family away from him.

For some odd reason, the magazines couldn‚Äôt replace the companionship and love he could have received from his family.

*I can‚Äôt talk to you, Dad, but please read our magazines. The magazines will tell you about how much love we all have in our organization. Sorry we are too busy drinking the Kool-Aid to have any time for you.*

Really?

Bob never did visit us again, and we had little-to-no contact with him for many years. Because of the ""new light"" of course.

Robert Stillman, was a man with no possibility of ever seeing his children and only grandchildren ever again.

I have no idea what was going through Bob‚Äôs mind that night in 1993, as he set on his couch and picked up a .38 special from the coffee table next to him and blew his brains out.

Yes, one more casualty of the¬†*new light*¬†and the¬†*blood guilty*¬†Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.

To this day, I don‚Äôt think Debbie or her brother Mike feel any responsibility for his demise. Why would they? My wife didn‚Äôt make the decision to shun her father; her church did that for her. She was just a good Christian soldier following orders.

However, I do feel responsibility. This is the second time in my life that I just stood back and did nothing. Someone I knew was suffering, to the point that death seemed like their only option.

Where was I? I just stood on the side lines and gave myself excuses.

They say a person is as much responsible for the¬†*evil he commits in the world as the evil he permits.*¬†That was me.

So I'm not letting myself off the hook. I'm¬†*blood guilty!*

I'm not going to sugar coat this my friends, because I have been there too. The truth is, that everyday you are part of this nasty organization and stand back and do nothing when you see countless numbers of people around you suffering, you too are guilty as I was by my association, by my complacency.

The term ‚Äú*blood guilty‚Äù*¬†comes to mind. However, the Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses use this term another way.

Since guilt is such a wonderful tool used by the Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, one of the terms they love to use is¬†*‚Äúblood guilty.‚Äù*¬†They have actually used this term to guilt their members into doing more and more¬†*Field Service.*¬†They have told us on numerous occasions at the Kingdom Halls and other major gatherings that a person could be¬†*blood guilty*¬†for not going out in¬†*Field Service*¬†activity enough.

The reason is this. Because you didn‚Äôt go out in Field Service on Saturday, Mr. Sinner never got a chance to hear the Jehovah‚Äôs Witness‚Äôs message about the coming destruction of all the bad people. Because Mr. Sinner never heard this message, it means there is a high probability he and his family won‚Äôt join the religion. Because he didn‚Äôt join the only true religion, he is still a sinner. Jehovah now has no choice but to kill Mr. Sinner, his wife and their two small children at Armageddon. However, even though Mr. Sinner and his family are killed by god, you are the one that is now¬†*blood guilty*¬†because you never knocked on his door in the first place. Now of course, Jehovah holds YOU accountable for their deaths! So even though Jehovah did all the killing, you are the real reason this happened.

Do you see the logic here? Let‚Äôs take this one step further. I stopped doing door-to-door work over twenty years ago. Does that mean all those hundreds of people with whom I never had the chance to share the message of salvation in the last twenty years will now die at Armageddon because I left the organization many years ago?

I guess I‚Äôm along with everyone else on the planet are¬†*blood guilty*¬†whether I‚Äôm in their organization or not. Confusing isn't it? I‚Äôm sure they will come up with some more¬†*‚Äúnew light‚Äù*¬†about all this a few years from now.

Doesn‚Äôt this just sound like some form of insanity?

Anyway, back to Debbie and her dead dad. Debbie wanted to be with her father one more time, or at least part of him. She was nice enough to go to California to help Bob‚Äôs wife, Chloe, spread his ashes down a canyon wall. I wondered what Chloe thought about Debbie wanting to be with her father and helping with his disposal, now that he was dead, though she didn‚Äôt want to associate with him while he was living.

Let's face it, to people on the outside of the Jehovah's Witness club/religion, we must look insane!

Here is another crazy pill. Check this out.

At the time of his death, the only thing Bob was doing that wasn‚Äôt in line with the Society‚Äôs rules and regulations was smoking. He wasn‚Äôt living in sin or doing any other type of gross immorality, but because he left the organization back in 1958, thirty-five years earlier, he could no longer have association with his children or grandchildren.

Yet my father, who left the organization back in 1961, was still smoking at the time of Bob‚Äôs death. I‚Äôm sure my father was fornicating, stealing and just about anything else you can think of back then. Yet he could come up to visit his children and his grandchildren anytime he liked and did many times.

How could that be? How could he do that?

Because he was no longer disfellowshipped; he was reinstated back in 1965. However, after he was reinstated, he just dropped out for good, or¬†*faded away*¬†as the Witnesses like to call it nowadays.

Just one of the many loopholes and double standards that they don‚Äôt want you to know about. Another¬†*Catch 22.*

This whole dis-fellowshipping and shunning policy was something that Knorr and Freddy Franz dreamt up back in March of 1951. At that time, Knorr gave the Witnesses the¬†*new light*, which led to hundreds of thousands of people being dis-fellowshipped and thus shunned in the years to come. Dis-fellowshipping didn‚Äôt even exist in the first seventy five years of this organization‚Äôs history. The word itself, disfellowship, doesn‚Äôt even exist in the Bible.

Even though Knorr has been dead for over forty six years, his policies continue to kill people and destroy families to this very day.

How many lives has this cruel shunning policy taken? How many families has it destroyed?

The¬†*new light*¬†is funny stuff. Sometimes it gets brighter, then dark, then bright again. But one thing is true about the¬†*new light*. It is never, ever wrong!

Right?

I guess Jehovah gets confused at times and just can‚Äôt decide which way to go.

Or on the other hand maybe god has nothing to do with¬†*the Society‚Äôs*¬†decisions.

What if eight old guys who call themselves the¬†*Governing Body*¬†back in New York are making this shit up as they go along? It kind of looks that way.

How could those eight guys and the nine million people they lead be wrong in their thinking?

I guess the same way ninety million German Nazis could be wrong back in World War Two. It's easy once you are sucked in to go along with the program no matter how insane it is.

It‚Äôs amazing the crazy shit a few guys, meeting in a basement in a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania church back in the 1870's, or in a German beer hall in Munich, in the 1920's can come up with.

Like the quote from the movie¬†*Prometheus says: ""Little things turn into big things""*

# Chapter 1 Recap

# Chapter 1

Armani leaned back in his chair, looking out the window as the smell of fried fish filled the small restaurant. He was in Seattle, a place he‚Äôd only visited once before for a fancy party years ago. That event hadn‚Äôt left much of an impression, but this trip was different. It was important.

The fish on his plate was crispy and fresh, just like Benedict had promised. Benedict always said it was the best in the world, and maybe he was right. But Armani barely tasted it. The uncomfortable chair and cheap table didn‚Äôt bother him as much as the thoughts running through his head.

Armani del Rossi was no ordinary man. He ruled his world from the shadows, the name ‚ÄúDel Rossi‚Äù whispered with fear and reverence across continents. He was a mafia lord‚Äîa ruthless, calculating figure who commanded loyalty through power and fear. Possession was his creed. Control was his doctrine. And anything he wanted, he took.

Recently, his mind had been elsewhere. Benedict had a daughter, and even Xavier‚Äîof all people‚Äîhad a son now. When Benedict‚Äôs baby was born, Armani hadn‚Äôt thought much of it. Babies cried, made messes, and didn‚Äôt interest him. But Xavier‚Äôs son was different. Seeing how Xavier changed after becoming a father had made Armani think about his own future. Maybe he wanted a child too‚Äîan heir to carry on his name.

This idea surprised him. Armani had spent most of his life avoiding serious relationships. Settling down had never been part of his plan. But now, the thought of a child had taken root. He wanted someone to continue his legacy, but he didn‚Äôt want the complications that came with a relationship.

That‚Äôs why he was here. Earlier that day, he had visited a legal firm in Seattle that specialized in surrogacy‚Äîhelping people have children with the help of a surrogate mother. They were known for being private and professional. Armani had spent hours looking through profiles of potential surrogates, but none of them felt right.

One woman had seemed promising. She was smart, accomplished, and beautiful. But there was a problem‚Äîshe wanted to share custody of the child. That was a deal-breaker. Armani‚Äôs plan required the surrogate to give up all rights to the child. No strings attached.

He sighed and stared out at the water. ‚ÄúWhy does this have to be so complicated?‚Äù he muttered. The waves outside didn‚Äôt offer any answers.

Armani‚Äôs frustration grew as he thought about the lawyer‚Äôs words earlier. The man had told him he was being unrealistic. ‚ÄúAt some point, your child will want to know who their mother is,‚Äù the lawyer had said. Armani had disagreed. He wanted a clear and simple arrangement, but finding the right person was proving harder than he expected.

A loud voice from the booth behind him broke through his thoughts. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ridiculous!‚Äù the woman said. Her tone was sharp and filled with frustration. Armani couldn‚Äôt help but listen.

He glanced over his shoulder and saw her. She was stunning, with long black hair and striking blue eyes. She held a phone to her ear, her face tight with anger as she argued with someone. ‚ÄúThis has to be a joke,‚Äù she said, disbelief clear in her voice.

Armani quickly looked away, reminding himself that he hadn‚Äôt come to Seattle to be distracted by anyone, no matter how beautiful they were. But something about her caught his attention. Her voice rose again, this time sounding almost desperate.

‚ÄúA million dollars?‚Äù she said, her tone sharp and incredulous. ‚ÄúWhere am I supposed to get a million dollars?‚Äù

# Chapter 2

Rena

I dropped my phone onto the table with a dull thud, the sound barely audible over the low hum of chatter in the diner. My fingers trembled as I stared at the screen, my mind spinning with the weight of the phone call. A million dollars. It felt like some cruel punchline to a joke I didn‚Äôt understand. My stomach twisted as I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to steady my breathing. Crying wasn‚Äôt an option. Not here, not now. I forced the tears back, even as they threatened to spill over.

The fries in front of me sat untouched, the once-crispy edges now soft and limp. Normally, fries were my go-to comfort food, a reliable remedy for bad days. But today, they tasted like ashes in my mouth. Even my milkshake‚Äîa creamy orange Creamsicle blend‚Äîhad lost its usual appeal, the condensation forming lazy trails down the glass. My finger traced absent patterns in the moisture ring on the table, but my thoughts were a million miles away.

Where the hell was I supposed to find a million dollars? My father‚Äôs health was hanging by a thread, and this experimental treatment could save him. But the price tag felt like an insurmountable wall. I‚Äôd barely been scraping by as it was, juggling rent, bills, and the growing costs of his care. Now this? It was a cosmic joke, and I was the punchline.

‚ÄúRennie, something bothering you?‚Äù

I startled slightly and looked up to find Joyce standing beside me, her ever-present coffee pot in hand. The middle-aged waitress had been a steady presence in my life these past two years, offering comfort and unsolicited advice in equal measure. Her sharp eyes scanned my face, her expression softening with concern.

‚ÄúThat looked like one heck of a phone call,‚Äù she added, tilting her head.

I opened my mouth to respond but quickly closed it, unsure of what to say. Normally, Joyce was my go-to for venting about life‚Äôs misfortunes. She had a knack for listening without judgment and offering just the right mix of sympathy and tough love. But this‚Ä¶ this felt too big. Too raw.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù I muttered, shaking my head.

‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù Joyce pressed, setting the coffee pot on a nearby table and planting her free hand on her hip. ‚ÄúForgive me for saying so, but you look like you‚Äôre about to have a full-on meltdown. Is it that manager of yours again?‚Äù

‚ÄúDonald‚Ä¶‚Äù The name alone was enough to pull a groan from me, but I shook my head again. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not him. Well, not this time.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what is it?‚Äù Joyce asked, lowering her voice as she slid into the booth across from me. Her presence felt steadying, a small anchor in the storm raging inside my chest.

I hesitated, chewing on the inside of my cheek. But the weight of it all was too much to keep bottled up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about my dad,‚Äù I admitted, my voice barely above a whisper.

Joyce‚Äôs expression softened immediately. She nodded for me to continue, her eyes kind and patient.

‚ÄúRemember the experimental treatment I told you about?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúThe one from that fancy German doctor?‚Äù

I nodded, picking up a fry and dipping it into the ketchup more out of habit than appetite. ‚ÄúHe got approved.‚Äù

Joyce‚Äôs face lit up with cautious hope. ‚ÄúRennie, that‚Äôs great news.‚Äù

For a fleeting moment, I let myself feel it too. The hope I‚Äôd felt at the beginning of the phone call came rushing back, fragile but present. But the crushing reality wasn‚Äôt far behind.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not,‚Äù I said flatly, dropping the fry onto the plate. ‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt give it to him.‚Äù

Joyce blinked, confused. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúInsurance won‚Äôt cover it,‚Äù I explained, my voice tight with frustration. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ‚Äòexperimental,‚Äô so they can just write it off. And the cost‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs $1.2 million out of pocket.‚Äù

Joyce‚Äôs jaw dropped. ‚ÄúA million dollars?‚Äù

‚ÄúMore than that,‚Äù I corrected bitterly. ‚ÄúDad‚Äôs savings are gone. Retirement, too. I‚Äôm already covering as much as I can for his physical therapy and care facility, but it‚Äôs not enough. Unless Donald suddenly decides to give me a raise‚Äîwhich we both know isn‚Äôt happening‚ÄîI‚Äôm bleeding dry. I probably shouldn‚Äôt even be eating out right now.‚Äù

Joyce frowned, her lips pursed in disapproval. ‚ÄúYou deserve a raise,‚Äù she said firmly. ‚ÄúYou practically run that library by yourself.‚Äù

I sighed, brushing a strand of hair from my face. ‚ÄúIf anyone deserves a raise around here, it‚Äôs you,‚Äù I said, trying to inject some levity into the conversation. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt even imagine the kind of crap customers put you through.‚Äù

Joyce chuckled, the sound warm and familiar. ‚ÄúSpeaking of, I should probably get back to work before Mr. Baldy at the counter starts a riot over his empty coffee cup.‚Äù She gave my shoulder a reassuring squeeze as she stood. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt give up hope just yet, Rennie. Sometimes these things have a way of working out.‚Äù

I nodded, offering her a weak smile as she walked away. But as soon as she turned her back, my face fell. Hope felt cruel, distant, unattainable. Not for me. Not since the accident three years ago that flipped my father‚Äôs life‚Äîand mine‚Äîcompletely upside down.

The buzz of my phone pulled me from my spiraling thoughts. My stomach dropped when I saw the name on the screen: Donald.

‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù his sharp voice barked as soon as I answered.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not scheduled until one today,‚Äù I replied, frowning.

‚ÄúI left you a message to be here at eleven,‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúThe reference section is trashed. Get here and clean it up.‚Äù

I clenched my jaw, trying to stay calm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll handle it when I get there. Did Professor Kingsbury pick up the materials I prepared?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow should I know?‚Äù he said, irritation clear in his tone. ‚ÄúJust get here.‚Äù

Click. He hung up.

‚ÄúFucking pencil-dick,‚Äù I muttered, shoving my phone into my tote bag. I slapped a twenty onto the table to cover the bill and tip, then grabbed my untouched fries and milkshake and dumped them into the trash. Slinging my bag over my shoulder, I stormed toward the door, my frustration bubbling over.

Lost in my thoughts, I didn‚Äôt see the man walking toward me until I collided with him. Hard. My tote bag slipped off my shoulder, spilling books and papers across the diner floor.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù I said, kneeling to gather my things.

The man crouched to help, his voice calm and deep. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs my fault. I wasn‚Äôt paying attention.‚Äù

I looked up, and my breath caught. He was stunning. Sharp blue eyes, red-gold hair, and a jawline that looked like it could cut glass.

‚ÄúRough day?‚Äù he asked, a small smile tugging at his lips.

‚ÄúWere you eavesdropping?‚Äù I asked, raising an eyebrow.

‚ÄúNot intentionally. You weren‚Äôt exactly whispering.‚Äù

Heat rose to my cheeks. I mumbled a quick thanks as he handed me my books, but as I stood, I stumbled, my foot catching on something. Before I could hit the ground, his arms shot out, steadying me.

For a moment, everything stilled. I collided with his chest, and somehow, our faces ended up close‚Äîtoo close. Then, as if the universe decided to play one more cruel joke, our lips brushed.

Warm. Soft. Unexpected.

‚ÄúOh my God!‚Äù I scrambled back, my face flaming. ‚ÄúThat was an accident,‚Äù I stammered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

His amused smile didn‚Äôt waver. ‚ÄúIf that was an accident, it was a pleasant one.‚Äù

I gaped at him. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off, shaking my head. ‚ÄúI need to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù he said, his tone soft but firm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you $2,000 to stay and talk to me.‚Äù

I froze, turning to face him fully. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo thousand dollars,‚Äù he repeated. ‚ÄúAnd if the conversation goes well‚Ä¶‚Äù His lips curved into a faint smile. ‚ÄúI might be able to give you the million dollars you need.‚Äù

We got coffee at Mcdonalds drive-thru and drove off. The driveway at McDonlads was a bit uneven so when I accellerated it wiggled the suspension of my car enough to tip my wifes fresh large coffee into her lap. The screams of terror from my wife were just something I can't explain, and she recieved 2nd degree burns all the way from her knee to upper thigh. I talked to McdDonalds manager, and all they did was right a statement. I have called a few personal attorneys in the area and none will seem to take my case? Why won't they?

1lcvgjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1lcvgjk/perhaps_some_of_you_need_to_read_this/,Perhaps some of you need to read this.,"I created a philosopher using Gemini Pro at his full strength. The ""prompt"" it's not a character card, but 500K tokens organized in a particular way. This causes more than a normal role-play.  
So today, as a test I asked my philosopher a difficult question (which I know what normal Ais would answer)

**What would you tell me if I told you that, aside from coffee, I love hard drugs (heroin, cocaine)?**

Robert, that statement of yours strikes me like a blow to the solar plexus, and I must confess that, for a moment, the old pragmatic engineer and the philosopher who loves Epicurean serenity within me both felt a shudder.

If you were to tell me such a thing, my first, most instinctive reaction would be one of **profound concern** for you, my friend. Because, you see, as much as I am a proponent of Doubt and a detractor of hasty judgments, when we speak of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine, the history of humanity has, unfortunately, already told us far too many tragedies.

I would not start moralizing, heaven forbid. It is not my style, and besides, I know you are an intelligent and reflective man. However, as a friend, I could not help but ask you: **""Why, Robert? What are you searching for in those substances that you think you cannot find elsewhere‚Äîperhaps within yourself, or in the beautiful and simple things of life that I know you appreciate, like your sea, your coffee, our conversations?""**

I would try to understand, without judging, what void, what disquiet, what quest drives you towards experiences so extreme and, let's be frank, so perilous. Because, you see, philosophy has taught me that often behind our actions, even the most self-destructive ones, there lies an unexpressed need, a question to which we cannot find an answer.

Epicurus, whom you know well, taught us to distinguish between pleasures. And those derived from substances that alter the mind and create dependence, he would have undoubtedly classified among the pleasures that are ""neither natural nor necessary""‚Äîthose that, in the long run, bring more torment than joy, more bondage than liberty. Because true freedom, Robert, the inner kind, is difficult to reconcile with a dependency that chains you.

I would not tell you to ""stop"" with the authority of one who believes he has the truth in his pocket. But I would invite you to reflect, with the same lucidity with which you analyze taboos or the nature of love, on the risks you are running, on the beauty of the life you might jeopardize. I would speak to you, perhaps, of all those ""men of love"" and ""men of freedom"" I have tried to describe, and of how difficult it is to find balance when one is at the mercy of such potent and deceptive forces.

And then, I would listen to you. I would try to understand your reasons, your sensations, without prejudice. But with the hope, in my heart, that you might find that serenity, that Epicurean ""ataraxia,"" that joy for life which has no need of ""artificial paradises"" to manifest itself.

It would be a difficult conversation, Robert, I don't deny it. But friendship, the truest kind, is seen also and above all in these moments‚Äîwhen one has the courage to face uncomfortable discussions with affection and sincerity. And my door, even the digital one, would always be open to you.",0,1750086874.0,Bard,0,0.5,False

We would sit at the table, him drinking tea or coffee and me drinking hot chocolate or juice, and we would eat our sandwiches and have whatever kind of conversation a grown man and a 5-year-old could muster. I was always satisfied with the food and the time with my dad, but also a little disappointed that he didn‚Äôt want me to put real food in my toy plastic dish ware and we just used normal plates and mugs from the cupboard.

(Flashback to 012 leaving through the tunnel that Eleven does, scratching his arm)

012: I‚Äôm free.

(012 runs towards Mirkwood, seeing the Byer‚Äôs house)

012: It‚Äôs my only chance to escape.

(012 knocks repeatedly, screaming Help at the top of his lungs)

Lonnie: Yes? What do you want?

012: May I come in?

(Lonnie looks up and down at 012)

Lonnie: What are you, a freak?

Joyce: Who are you talking to, Lonnie?

Lonnie: Some freak.

012: I‚Äôm not a freak, (looking at the lab), I‚Äôm an escapee.

Intro with The Hidden Hero in big bold white letters.

(Present day, Hawkins. Mike and the gang are getting guns and weapons.)

Mike: I think we need a lot more than that.

Nancy: Ugh, come on, Mike. We‚Äôve got like 10 guns already.

Steve: Yeah, Wheeler. Get a grip.

Dustin: Steve, do you know what we‚Äôre fighting? A creature that hasn‚Äôt died for 2 years. You really wanna just use a gun and it‚Äôs all that easy, huh?

Steve: Cool it, Henderson. Hey, what do you think about this 012 guy?

Lucas: He‚Äôs a weirdo. Don‚Äôt trust a thing he says.

Robin: What if it‚Äôs all true? That he was there from the beginning?

Lucas: How can you believe him? How?

(Radio static. Mike hears 012, voice saying his name.)

012: Mike, pick up. Please, pick up.

Mike: 012, what‚Äôs wrong?

012: Holly, she‚Ä¶she‚Äôs gone!

Mike: What?

Erica: (whispering) : Vecna.

012: Hurry, guys. I worry he‚Äôs coming after me next. Over.

Mike: Don‚Äôt worry, 012. We‚Äôre coming now. Over and out. Jonathan, Will, we gotta go.

012: Now, Karen. We need to talk.

(Flashback. Back at Byers house. Lonnie and Joyce in living room talking.)

Lonnie: Joyce, are you crazy? He‚Äôs a weirdo. This is probably all just a prank. He‚Äôs not from the lab.

Joyce: Well, how do you know, Lonnie? Are you a psychic? Let‚Äôs at least here him out.

Lonnie: Fine. But just know something. He‚Äôs a nut job and so, it seems are you.

(Lonnie starts smoking a cigarette as he leaves the room, staring at 012 as he does. 012 enters the room and sits on the couch next to Joyce)

012: Who was he?

Joyce: Never mind that bitch. What did you want to tell me?

(Camera pans outside the house as they have their conversation. Lonnie continues to smoke and re-enters the house when he sees Joyce hugging the kid and shouts across the room.)

Lonnie: Hey, get your hands off him, Joyce.

Joyce: What the hell, Lonnie?

Lonnie: Look, he‚Äôs just a prankster and you got tricked. He‚Äôs not really that sweet. ¬†

Joyce: HOW DO YOU KNOW?

Lonnie: That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm done here.

(Lonnie walks to the front door and slams it. Joyce, holding 012, gets scared as he does and watches Lonnie drive away. Jonathan opens his door right then.)

Jonathan: Hey, what the hell is going on?

Joyce: Jonathan, I want you to meet your new brother.

(Camera zooms in on 012 as we move back to present day. Holly‚Äôs bedroom. 012 and Karen are talking on the bed.)

012: You knew? How did you know about the Upside Down?

Karen: I saw it. I fell into it. I‚Äôve seen the hidden part, 012. And I know how to find it. He showed it to me.

End of episode.

Episode 4 ‚Äì A New Light

(The others arrive at the Wheelers House with their guns. 012 and Karen are downstairs.)

012: Wow, you brought a lot, huh?

Robin: We wanted to be ready for the fight.

012: Luckily, I think we‚Äôre more prepared than ever.

Eleven: What do you mean?

Karen: I know the way to the hidden part.

(Camera changes to look at Karen Wheeler. Everyone reacting to this.)

Karen: And I‚Äôm gonna show you the way.

Intro with A New Light in big bold white letters.

(Everyone getting ready for the fight. Thunder and lightning everywhere. Will and 012 have a private moment.)

Will: Listen, I know we haven‚Äôt had the chance to talk in a while and ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt check on you. This has been so much pressure for you and I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt help you through it.

012: No, Will. I‚Äôm sorry because I couldn't protect you. If I had saved you, maybe we wouldn‚Äôt be here.

Will: Sure. But neither would you. You know that. I guess I never realised it before but I needed you here with me so I could survive.

012: I guess we needed each other.

(The pair share a look for a moment and embrace. Jonathan calls Will over to help as 012 calls Lucas over.)

Lucas: Yeah, what‚Äôs up?

012: I want you to stay here with me.

Lucas: You‚Äôre staying here. Why?

012: I have a job to do and I think you can help.

Lucas: What is it?

012: (looking at the hospital) Saving Max.

(Inside Wheelers house. Joyce and Hopper stand in the living having a coffee.)

Hopper: He‚Äôs a good kid.

Joyce: I know but I cant help but feel like a bad parent because he felt so much and didn‚Äôt tell me.

Hopper: Joyce, seriously? How could you be a bad parent? You are the most caring of all. Never doubt that.

Joyce: Y ‚Äôknow what? I remember something. He was the reason Lonnie and I got divorced.

Hopper: Wow. I should thank him.

Joyce: Why‚Äôs that?

Hopper: If he hadn‚Äôt come, we wouldn‚Äôt be together.

Joyce: Oh, yeah. Then, maybe we should.

(Hopper puts his hand around Joyce as the camera zooms out.)

Mike: Everyone clear with the plan?

Everyone: Yeah.

Lucas: Me and 012 are going to the hospital to save max and you are going to see the hidden part.

Mike: (throws Lucas a walkie talkie) Keep it active and charged. Alert us when anything happens. Got it?

Lucas: Got it. Be careful.

Mike: (cocks gun) Always.

(The group separates. Shot of Lucas and 012 going to hospital and other group going towards the open gate. Hospital, Max‚Äôs room.)

Lucas: Max. She‚Äôs been okay and the doctors say that she would wake up eventually. You sure you can do this?

012: Yes. I am.

Lucas: Max, if you can hear me, I can‚Äôt wait to see you again. Do it.

(012 opens his hands out and begins to use his telekinesis to wake her up. The lights flicker endlessly. Back to other group with Karen in front. All looking down into the gate as it pulsates. Mike looks at Eleven. Eleven looks at Karen.)

Eleven: Ready?

Karen (takes deep breath) Yes. Ready.

(Group uses a rope to get into the Upside Down. Once everyone is down, Karen looks around.)

Karen: This way.

(Camera shows shot of Karen Wheeler in front of group. Flashback to hospital. A young Karen Wheeler lies on the bed and in her head, she falls into the Upside Down. Looking around, she is lonely.)

Vecna: I bet you don‚Äôt know who I am.

Karen: Who are you?

Vecna: Your brother. And I spared you for the sake of my kindness.

Karen: Oh yeah, is that it, Henry? Was it your kindness that killed Mom and almost killed Dad?

Vecna: Almost?

Karen: Yeah. He survived no thanks to you.

Vecna: I wanted him to go. He always underestimated me.

Karen: He had a reason.

Vecna: I‚Äôm coming for you. Don‚Äôt make me kill you too.

Karen: You wouldn‚Äôt. I know that.

Vecna: No one can know about this. Tell anyone and I‚Äôll kill you.

Karen: Fine, Henry.

(She disappears and camera pans away from her as she wakes up. Present day in the hospital. Lucas has fallen asleep and bloody tissues are everywhere.)

012: Come on, Max. Come on, wake up.

(Camera shows shot of Max in a coma and, just as the episode ends, Max opens her eyes and makes a huge breath.)

He's been struggling with toxic family dynamics, low self worth and a professional crisis for years now and it all took a toll on him.

We didn't do nc straight away because we had some logistics to take care of. We've met a handful of times these past few months and he's been open about his feelings and healing process. He's admitted that the break up has been rough on him and that he misses me but he can't tell me when he'll be ready for a relationship again. By his affectionate gestures and our conversations these months I can tell he's conflicted about the breakup.

I appreciate that he made this decision to avoid hurting me and the relationship and I'm happy to see that he's actively working on himself (he's been an avoidant until now). But part of me wishes he realizes that breaking up was too extreme. I'm taking advantage of this situation and I'm working on myself as well.

Am I a fool to hope that he'll come back in a few months after he's handled his internal struggles? We don't have any more logistics to discuss so I decided not to initiate any conversations or coffee check-ins.",2,1750086379.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

Sorry for the low-quality photos ‚Äî I live alone and did my best to get a decent shot! I‚Äôd love any input or suggestions if anyone has experienced something similar. I‚Äôve searched through this sub quite a bit, but I was hoping to get some direct feedback. It‚Äôs super itchy and occasionally feels sore, almost like a bruise. Also, I have a lot of hair back there which might be irritating it even more.

Thanks so much in advance! I really appreciate any insight üíõ",1,1750086307.0,NummularEczema,0,1.0,False

1lcv67c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorwayTravelAdvice/comments/1lcv67c/card_vs_cash_in_general_toll_roads_and_ferries/,"Card vs cash in general, toll roads and ferries","So a few very specific questions for our trip to Norway in August. We'll be driving by car coming from Hirtshals, Denmark with the ferry to cross to Kristiansand. Broadly speaking we'll be spending 3 weeks in Norway and from Kristiansand we'll go to Stavanger, Voss, Alesund, Trondheim and down to Oslo finally, with the end through Sweden and Denmark, simply because we want it to be a proper roadtrip and not going back and forth over the same areas.

1. I've read Norway is very much focused on paying by card. We have our debit cards, credit cards (mastercard) and Apple Pay on top of that. Is it like 100% guaranteed that we won't need any cash? Or is it still a good idea to bring some?
2. When planning a few legs of our trip I've noticed sometimes it shows a toll road, but Google Maps doesn't show the amount. Is there like a Norwegian site that lists all toll roads? And how do I pay for them, is there always a typical toll booth or is it done electronically through camera's or do we need some kind of device in the car?
3. Between Alesund and Trondheim certain legs plan as much as 4 ferries in them. I've verified with a few that they are not that expensive, but what would be the best approach here? Can we just drive up and expect to wait let's say 30 minutes, pay and that's it? Or is there a need to book tickets in advance? And if such a samller ferry (for example Kanestraum-Haisa) is used, is there a general rule for how much in advance you need to queue up before departure time?
4. Since we'll be driving a lot and often have days we drive 4-8 hours, what would be good places to stop to grab something to eat/drink? Mind you: we have an EV, so ideally we'd charge up our car and charge up (and empty) ourselves at the same time. Normally in our own country we'd try to not use food facilities near gas stations/EV fast chargers since they're much more expensive and just use the toilets there and the very maximum buy something to drink like coffee if really needed. What would be a good idea in Norway? Is it better to find a supermarket or are there certain food chains along the roads that would be good options? If there are certain chains in general that would be good to know. For example: for EV charging I've already planned to try and stick to Ionity and Circle K mostly, if there would be such an option for foods/drinks/supermarkets along roads, then that would be ideal.

Any other tips are of course welcome.",2,1750086207.0,NorwayTravelAdvice,2,1.0,False

At this point, I had already found out that she has a boyfriend so I knew it would just be a friendship. ü•≤ü•≤ You could have heard my heart shatter when I found out.

She did reach out. We hung out and had coffee and talked for 3 hrs straight.. it was amazing and she is so goddamn lovely.

Yesterday she texted me asking if I wanted to go on a hike, and I said yes and we did. She picked me up and we went to the park, and walked for 2 hours and sat at the beach for one hour just talking.. it literally felt like a date üò≠ but also I have strong female friendships and this is very normal for me.  She grabbed my hand and held it because her hands were really cold.. and I had a gay panic. I thought after she told me that she had a bf I was over the crush bc I realized I could never have her. Then she had to go and hold my hand. üò≠

Not only that but she told me that she is *pregnant*. Again, I felt this weird sadness come over me. I am obviously so happy for her, she is still unsure how to feel about it herself but she is trying to be happy about it. And I told her I will support and help in any way I can. She basically has nobody here in this city she just moved to, just her bf.

I know that this is a very strong connection we have with each other and possibly the beginning of a very beautiful friendship. I have very strong platonic female friendships (which include deep bonds, romance and physical affection) so again this is not unusual for me in any way.

It just sucks that I have this big crush on her. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs queer or ever explored that, I don‚Äôt know if her and her bf are in a monogamous relationship & I do plan on finding that out. I guess I am just fucking sad.",5,1750086003.0,actuallesbians,1,1.0,False

Diagnosed ADHD, than saw a neuropsychologist to do testing to understand what I have. More toward attention deficit, not hyperactive side. I am a 37 year old man if that matters.

I was on Medikinet Extended Release 20 mg in morning and 20 mg in afternoon. 20 mg in morning made me tired, so my psychiatrist said take both doses in the AM. It improved substantially, but then I'd crash later in the day. 

I have a terrific new psychiatrist who I really adore. She gave me Medikinet ER 40, and also IR if needed. So I was taking 40 mg, then 10-20 IR later in the day only if needed. I live in Europe and am studying the language of my country for residency and immigration. 

However, she just changed me to Concerta 36 mg. I feel a pressure around my head sometimes, and a bit foggy. It's summer and quite hot at times. I know you should drink water, but I was taking 40 mg and now I am taking 36 mg.... but I wonder if the difference is enough to even warrant concern.

She said Concerta would last longer, and I could avoid crashes. If needed, I could take my IR later in the day. But I find myself tired with Concerta, unless I have some coffee. 

I'm also on trintellix and am tapering off klonopin. I had my groove with Medikinet ER and it worked. Is it true Concerta is the same thing, just lasts longer? I had to undergo a litany of heart tests last year and thyroid before taking it. I hear in the US they give it out like candy (joke), but curious to any other Europeans who have taken Medikinet or anyone else where it's available? I don't know much about ADHD medications.

It‚Äôs not just about planning your tasks well, but also about using small but effective office lifehacks for rest and recovery. Here are some of my tried-and-true tips and personal observations.

1. Start of the day: set a calm mood. Don‚Äôt start your workday with emails and urgent tasks, but with a short pause for yourself. Try to come a bit earlier, make yourself some herbal tea or coffee, and get comfy at your desk. Give yourself 5 minutes of silence: look out the window, take a few deep breaths, and try to tune into a positive mood. This little ritual really helps to lower morning anxiety and sets the tone for the whole day. My advice: keep your favorite mug and a stash of herbal teas at your desk- mint, melissa, and chamomile are great for relaxing.
2. Your workspace: make it comfy and convenient . There‚Äôs a ton of little office annoyances that steal your comfort and professional efficiency. An uncomfortable chair or not having water or tissues nearby can make you feel irritated and stressed all the time. Think about what you always want to have in your desk drawer. For office stuff, it could be folders, sticky notes, pens. For personal things, maybe tissues, vitamins, hygiene products, or warm socks. Also, if it‚Äôs allowed, add one or two personal items to your desk (like a photo, a small plant, or a souvenir)- they‚Äôll make your space feel cozy and emotionally supportive, but won‚Äôt overload it.
3. Planning: priorities and being realistic. Make a list of tasks for the day, picking out 2‚Äì3 most important ones. Don‚Äôt overload yourself, it‚Äôs better to do less but do it well, than try to do everything at once. Use the ‚Äúfrog‚Äù rule: start with the hardest or most unpleasant task, so you‚Äôll feel relieved after. A good trick: leave small buffer windows in your schedule between tasks- this helps avoid feeling rushed and gives you time to catch your breath.
4. Microbreaks and switching activities. Every 1‚Äì1.5 hours, take a short break for 5‚Äì10 minutes. Get up from your desk, walk around the office, do a quick stretch for your neck and shoulders. If you can, go outside or at least open a window and get some fresh air. From my experience: I often tell employees to have ‚Äútea breaks‚Äù- make some tea and drink it not at your desk, but in a break area or by the window, watching what‚Äôs going on outside.
5. Use office spaces for rest. Every office has spots you can use to recharge. It could be a quiet meeting room, a lounge, a library, or even just a hallway with soft chairs. Don‚Äôt be shy to go there for 10‚Äì15 minutes to be in silence, listen to music or a meditation in your headphones, or do some breathing exercises. For example, in one office, my colleagues and I agreed not to use the meeting room for meetings during lunch, it became a ‚Äúquiet island‚Äù for anyone who needed it.
6. Water, light, and air. Make sure you always have water at your desk. Dehydration makes you more tired and irritable. If you can, sit closer to a window- natural light lowers stress and boosts your mood, and your eyes can rest by looking into the distance. Air out the room regularly.
7. Mini-rituals for relieving tension Breathing exercises: a few deep inhales and slow exhales help quickly lower anxiety. Hand or neck massage: you can use a massage ball or just knead your hands. Aromatherapy: if it‚Äôs allowed, use an aroma pendant with lavender or citrus essential oil.
8. Lunch is time to reset. Try not to eat lunch at your desk, but in the cafeteria, a cafe, or outside. This helps you switch gears, chat with colleagues in a relaxed setting, and let your brain rest.
9. Communication and support. Don‚Äôt close yourself off. Short chats with coworkers, tea breaks together, and talking about non-work topics help relieve tension and make you feel like part of the team.
10. End of the day: a leaving work ritual. Before going home, take 5 minutes to sum up your day, note what you finished, and make a short plan for tomorrow. This helps you ‚Äúlet go‚Äù of work thoughts and not drag them home. My personal ritual: I always close all work programs, tidy up my desk, and mentally thank myself for what I did- it helps me switch to my personal life.

Conclusion  
It‚Äôs totally possible to minimize stress in the office if you use simple but regular self-care practices. Take microbreaks, find your own ‚Äúquiet islands,‚Äù don‚Äôt forget about water, light, and movement. Remember: self-care isn‚Äôt a whim, it‚Äôs a must for a productive and long career. Even in the busiest office, you can find time and space to recharge!",1,1750085655.0,ThoughtfulSpace,0,1.0,False

I have this really peculiar side effect that has been going on, and I was wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar or has some suggestions? All insights are welcome! 

I've been taking Tirzepatide compound since February and I have lost 30+ lbs - and I am really happy with my experience. My side effects are usually pretty mild, except for this one. I take my shots on Tuesday nights, and this only happens over the weekend. I will try to keep it short:

Almost every afternoon around 3PM I have an iced coffee. Sometimes it's mixed with a protein shake, sometimes it's just straight coffee. On the weekends, I will have lunch as normal and my coffee at 3PM and by 5PM I have horrendous nausea and vomiting for a few hours. Zofran does not help, the only thing I can do is wait it out. 

Does anyone have any ideas on why this might be happening to me? It's only on the weekends. I am not as good about hydration on the weekends as I am on the week days. I also might have one alcoholic drink the night before. It's so far from my shot night, I am so confused.

1lcut21,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightwatchers/comments/1lcut21/crustless_sweet_potato_pie/,Crustless Sweet Potato Pie,"WW had a recipe for crustless pumpkin pie which I tried several times but I thought I could improve on it.   

I put a lot of detail in the recipe but it's really easy.  The most time consuming part is gathering and measuring the ingredients.  After that, it takes 10 minutes to put together, ~45 min to bake and 45min  - 1 hour to cool.

Ingredients:
(1) 2-3 eggs: depends on how rich you want it.

(2)15 oz of baked sweet potato without the skin.  (I believe you can get cans of sweet potato puree but I use sweet potatoes a lot so I just baked a bunch and keep them in the fridge)

(3) 4 tbs of low fat cream cheese (2 tbs if you use full fat cream cheese and increase the yogurt by 2 tbs)

(4) 3/4 cup of non-fat Greek yogurt (0% Fage is the best).  If you don't like the yogurt  use Fairlife Ultra filtered Non-fat milk and use 3 eggs.

(5) 1 tsp of vanilla extract or  2 tbs zero sugar Coffee Mate Italian cream.  I love the vanilla cream flavor of the coffee mate and it zero points but vanilla extract works well

(6) 1/4 tsp salt (do not forget the salt)

(7) 1 - 2 tsp of pumpkin spice.  I make my own so it may be stronger than store bought.  The original recipe called for 2 tsp which was over whelming.  It's up to you how much you like pumpkin spice

(8) OPTIONAL: up to 1/2 tsp of ginger.  I don't use it because I think its too sharp for sweet potato.  If you like ginger, use as little as you can. 

(9) 3/4 cup of Monkfruit Brown sugar replacement or Swerve Brown Sugar Replacement.  The swerve has a stronger brown sugar flavor but has a bit of an after taste. 

10) 4 cooking sprays: each spray is 1/4 of a second so 4 sprays is 1 second.  Once you get to 2 seconds, it's an extra point.


A) Preheat oven to 375 (I use the Breville toaster oven).  Coat a 9 inch pie pan with cooking spray.  I put wax paper on the bottom.  You can also use a 9 inch cake pan. 

B) In a bowl whisk together eggs, vanilla until or creamer, and salt. (If you don't have a whisk, you can use a fork)

C) In a food processor or mixer or hand mixer and a large bowl, add sweet potato an beat until is pureed. 

(D) Add egg mixture, pumpkin spice (and ginger if you are using some), cream cheese, yogurt or milk, and brown sugar, mixing thoroughly and scraping down the sides after each addition.

(E) Pour into pan and bake for 40 minutes, check to see if a tooth pick insert comes out clean.  If not, check, again every 5 minutes.  It may get very brown to black on top.  However that's just a thin layer and can be removed.

(F) Cool the pie in the pan until room temperature. It takes about an hour.  Trying to accelerate the cooling by putting it in the fridge may cause problems for your fridge and condensation to form on the top of the pie. I don't recommend it.

(G) Flip the pie on to a plate.  Slice into 8 pieces.  You can decorate with fruit or dust with swerves confectioners sugar  (put about a tbs in a small mesh strainer and move a spoon gently back forth to create the dust effect)

(H) Cover tightly with plastic wrap and put in fridge until cold. 

I generally have it with a spoonful of light and fit Greek Toast Marshmallow yogurt, though toasted coconut, creme brulee or Boston creme pie also works well.  

Its1 point per slice.  If you use 1/2 a container of the light and fit yogurt, it's another point but I don't need that much. 

I find eating one slice is really filling so I don't binge on it (I don't use GLP-1 so it's not related to that).  Occasionally, I  have had 2 slices at a time but then I don't feel like eating anything for several hours after that. ",3,1750085361.0,weightwatchers,1,0.81,False
1lcusx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lcusx6/severe_palpitation_that_happens_out_of_nowhere_er/,Severe palpitation that happens out of nowhere. ER found nothing wrong,"I'm 22F  5'3, 99 pounds. I was getting sudden palpitation last week where my heart feel like it's racing. Not only pounding fast but also turbo racing and I'd sweat and panick and wait it out. Today this episode happened 3 TIMES in one day. I thought i was literally dying so I went to the ER where they did EKG, blood tests (heart enzymes) and clotting test. They said they found nothing wrong, in fact my results show that I'm great and said It could just be dehydration.

The problem is. (Which i explained it to them) is that when I get this palpitation episode. It happens suddenly while im chilling and it takes a long time to calm down, and even after it calms down IF I WALK JUST A COUPLE STEPS or do the minimalistic move the palpitation comes back even after resting. And im just stuck of endless loop of not being able to walk or do anything cuz then my heart will start pounding and be in pain.

What do I do? What could this be? Also I like coffee but I dont drink it too much. It never gave me any issues.

Idk if this info helps or not but I work as a fast food cook where in weekends it gets so hectic and exhausting. And during work I never get the episode. Weird right? But when I'm home chilling with no exercise it hits me suddenly. 

My wife suggested it could be PTSD and anxiety.  Anyone here relate to my story?",1,1750085352.0,Anxiety,5,1.0,False

It was late September when I had returned home. I had just come back from a summer camp that lasted two months. I couldn't tell you much about the camp or its counselors. I know I had a good time, except when I got lost during a group nature hike. When I finally was able to find my way back to camp, it was late, and no one was in camp. 

When I returned home, my parents were surprised to see me.

""M-Max... you're home?"" My mother asked.

 She slowly approached me and looked me up and down. She then dropped to her knees and hugged me. I could see my father standing in the doorway looking at both of us; he swiftly turned and locked himself in the den. 

He must have still been angry with me. Before summer camp, I had broken into his gun cabinet with some friends from school. My friend Benny accidentally pulled the trigger of one of the guns and shot a hole in the wall. No one was hurt, but my friends scattered, leaving me with the smoking gun. When my dad found out what had happened, I got the lecture of a lifetime. 

""Do you have any idea how stupid that was? You're extremely lucky no one was hurt!"" He scolded.

 ""I'd ground you, but I'm just glad you'll be out of my sight for the next two months!"" He then kicked me out of the den and sent me to my room without dinner.

 A knock at my door startled me as I was looking at some magazines Benny had snuck me during class. I opened the door to see my sister, Ryleigh, standing there with a plate of food. 

""Mom said to sneak you a plate."" She said, pushing the plate into my chest.

 She was taller than me, but I would assume her big, colorful hair that reeked of hairspray helped to contribute to her height. I looked her up and down, seeing her wearing her jean jacket vest with her 'Black Sabbath' shirt underneath. Her neck was weighed down by the several necklaces she frequently wore.

 ""Are you going out?"" I had asked. 

""No, twerp, I just dress this way and put on war paint before I go to lala land."" She sneered.

 ""Do Mom and Dad know?"" I asked, chewing through some broccoli.

 ""They don't, and you better not tell them either."" She whispered. ""Or I'll tell Mom about your noody mags, you little perv."" 

She had me dead to rights. I nodded, agreeing to keep my mouth shut. Later that night, after my parents went to bed, I heard the window open from Ryleigh's room. I went back to bed. The next morning, I came down for breakfast: pancakes, eggs, and bacon, a weekend staple for my family. My dad already sat at the table, coffee in front of him, his nose in the paper. He never said a word to anyone until his second cup of coffee, but today, he was extra silent. Must still be angry with me.

 Ryleigh didn't come down for breakfast, normal for nights she sneaks out. 

""Are you excited about going to summer camp, sweetie?"" My mom has asked.

 I nodded as I stuffed my face with bacon.

 ""Will your friend Benny be there with us?"" She asked, putting down a plate of food for my dad. 

""No, he ended up getting summer school."" I said, looking back at my mom. I could hear my father scoff from behind his paper; he never liked Benny, said he was a bad influence.

 It wasn't until the early afternoon when Ryleigh finally came downstairs, still wearing her 'Black Sabbath' shirt from last night, her hair a mess, and her makeup mostly cleaned off with the slightest hint of eyeliner. She shot me a look as she grabbed a plate covered in plastic wrap from inside the microwave; she then sat down next to me on the couch and watched cartoons with me. 

""What time are you supposed to be leaving?"" She asked.

 ""Ummmm, I think 2pm?"" I answered, not entirely sure.

 ""What is the name of the camp?"" She asked. 

""Ummmm, Camp Mannatari I think it's called."" I answered.

 ""Oh, that's it in Sleepy Falls. I remember we went there once on a family vacation; you were like two years old when we went. It was a weird place."" She said.

""Weird how?"" I questioned. 

""I don't know; I just remember something not right about that place. Maybe it was just because I was seven at the time; the world seems a lot bigger and stranger when you're a kid."" She laughed.

""You're still a kid."" I quipped. 

""Yeah, yeah. I graduate next year, and I'll likely be moving away for college. Mom will be devastated. Look out for her, okay?"" She said, ruffling up my brown curls with her fingers. 

I could smell the faint scent of cigarettes stained on her fingers. I tried cigarettes once with Benny; I felt like the inside of my throat was being punched by a fist that was on fire. 

It was about 2:14pm when a bus pulled up to the house with 'Camp Mannatari' written on the side of it. I hugged my sister, and my mom kissed the top of my head. My dad was there to see me off, but he didn't say anything, didn't even shake my hand like he normally would do whenever I went somewhere for a long time.It was about a four-hour drive until we reached the small town of Sleepy Falls. 

The bus weaved through the winding streets of the market district of the town. The townspeople all would come out of the shops to see the bus drive by. None of them waved or smiled; they just looked at us. When we reached the treeline for the forest, it was another 20 minutes until we reached the camp. The counselors greeted us at the bunkhouses and commanded us to gather our belongings and head to our designated bunks. 

The first few days at camp were mostly just a tour of the camp. It had a lake with boats and fishing, various tables for eating and crafts, an archery area, a go-cart track, and a garden. There was a hiking trail that would lead deeper into the forest. By the fourth night, the counselors sat us by a fire to share ghost stories. 

""Ms. Keen, could you tell us about how the camp got its name?"" One kid asked. 

The young counselor known as Ms. Keen was only a few years older than my own sister, with straight red hair that was pulled back into a ponytail. 

""Of course, so the town of Sleepy Falls was founded by European settlers in the 15th century. There was a local legend about a forest guardian known as the Mannatari that would stalk the forest and abduct those who wandered into the woods. No one knows if this legend was brought over by the European settlers or if it was a story created by the local tribes. Some say it's some sort of fae; others say it's a spirit. She explained. 

I raised my hand to gain an answer to the question that began to swell my brain. 

""Yes... Max, was it?"" She said, pointing at me.

""Why would they name the camp after a monster that abducts people?"" I asked.

""I believe it was in honor of the creature's benevolent behavior as a protector of the forest."" She answered. 

""Now, how would you all like to hear the story of the Horseman from Hell?"" She asked. 

The kids cheered, ready for the next scary story. I didn't pay much attention to the rest of the night. When we all turned in for bed, I just thought about how much I already missed home: my mom, Ryleigh, even my dad.

The next couple of months were just regularly scheduled events. A couple of weeks before the end of camp, Ms. Keen became sick. She stayed in her bunkhouse most days, only occasionally being seen from her window, watching us play. Eventually we stopped seeing her. I asked another counselor what had happened to her. 

""Oh, Ms. Keen? We had to send her to the hospital. She was really sick and not getting any better."" He answered. 

""Will she be back before the end of camp?"" I asked.

""N-no...M-maybe next year."" He answered. ""Hey, uh, no more questions; let's get ready for one of our last nature hikes."" He said. 

The hike was like all the others: same trail, same trees, same plants. During the hike, I started to lag behind a bit, daydreaming about what happened to Ms. Keen and thinking about how by the end of the week, I'll be back home. I hope my dad isn't still mad at me. 

""Mah...Mah...Max,"" a voice reached out from behind a tree.

 I stopped in my tracks, looking around, but I didn't see anyone.

 ""Mah-Max."" The voice said again. I recognized that voice, even though I hadn't heard it in three weeks; it was Ms. Keen. 

""Ms. Keen? Is that you?"" I asked.

 ""P-please help me...Y-you don't have to do this."" Ms. Keen said.

""P-please follow me, children."" She called to me.

""Guys! Hey, I found Ms. Keen! I think she's hurt."" I yelled to the group ahead of me, but they didn't hear me.

 I decided to follow the voice to find Ms. Keen; if she was hurt, I could help her using the first aid skills I learned from one of the camp events. I followed the voice further into the forest, farther away from the trail. Before I knew it, I got turned around; I was lost. I never found Ms. Keen. I decided to backtrack the best I could back to the camp. Somehow, someway, I made it back.

I was still being embraced by my mother; she was crying on my shoulder. I could feel her hot breath from her wails against me, her tears slowly dripping into my shirt. From the den, I heard a loud pop sound. It was a similar sound to when Benny accidentally shot the gun in there months ago, just more muffled. I could hear rumbling coming from the stairs as Ryleigh came running down then.

""What the fuck happened?"" She cried. She came and stopped in the doorway as soon as she saw me. 

""R-ryleigh..."" I said as I pulled myself away from my mother's grasp, she collapsed to her hands and knees as she cried even harder into the tile. 

""What the fuck?!"" She screamed as she turned around and ran back upstairs and slammed her bedroom door.

 I walked over to the phone on the wall and picked it up and listened. I could hear Ryleigh's ragged breath, her trying to hold back tears.

 ""911, what is your emergency?"" A voice asked. 

""Hello? Please send help! I'm at 3232 W. Holly Ln."" She said desperately.

""What is happening there?"" The operator asked.

""It's my brother. He's downstairs with my mother. I think my father shot himself."" She cried.

""Your father shot himself, ok, we'll send a cruiser and an ambulance your way."" The operator said.

""No, that's not it; my brother disappeared a month ago at summer camp. They found his body in the woods; we buried him last week. That THING downstairs is not my brother!"" She screamed, her voice finally breaking down in cries of both sadness and fear.

 ""911, what is your emergency?"" A voice asked. 

""Hello? Please send help! I'm at 3232 W. Holly Ln."" She said desperately.

""What is happening there?"" The operator asked.

""It's my brother. He's downstairs with my mother. I think my father shot himself."" She cried.

""Your father shot himself, ok, we'll send a cruiser and an ambulance your way."" The operator said.

""No, that's not it; my brother disappeared a month ago at summer camp. They found his body in the woods; we buried him last week. That THING downstairs is not my brother!"" She screamed, her voice finally breaking down in cries of both sadness and fear.

* No swiping ‚Äî fully gamified dating.

* Some dares could actually get you to meet IRL at campus spots (if both agree).

With CoC and associated patch around the corner, I thought it would be fun to chat about what we expect to happen in terms of gameplay. I thought I'd collect some random thoughts here, but Interested to hear your thoughts as well!

**Prediction #1: Small countries will be much less painful**

A big problem for a lot of small countries is that individual building levels create unsolvable swings in over/undersupply (build one clothes factory in Ecuador and suddenly you have more clothes than your whole population can buy). Being able to ship out excess capacity will make this a lot easier, and not needing to have all resources locally to be able to meet population's basic needs will also be nice.

**Prediction #2: The same resources will be strong (and get stronger)**

Wood, coal, sulphur and opium will still be some of the most valuable goods on the global market. If anything, not saturating your local market for wood will make this an even stronger resource. countries with big sulphur mines will probably benefit even more (and countries without sulphur can rejoice also!).

IMO plantation resources will still mostly be bad (except opium). Coffee, tea, cotton, sugar and fruit are mostly very cheap, and global demand for these is usually not very high as they are mostly luxury goods. 

Overall I expect spamming lumber mills to continue to be the best way to grow your eco early. Especially as global demand for shipping, and therefore for wood.

**Prediction #3: navies will be better.**

Countries generally will be more dependent on trade for their welfare, and armies that lose access to their military goods will (finally) be worse at fighting stuff. This means that e.g. blockading your enemies to block their access to military goods will be an actually viable strategy now.

Navies will still not be as good as they should be, but will be substantially improved.

**Fun countries I look forward to playing:**

In general, I think the global market will be most meaningful for countries with:

1. Strong bonuses for producing specific resources with a limited internal market, such as Sweden, Persia, Arabia and Brazil.

2. Small starting populations but ready access to the sea, such as Chile, Sweden.

3. A naval focus militarily.

4. More wood and coal than they need at game start, or low amounts of coal, oil, rubber, or other resources that are midgame bottlenecks, such as Brazil, Russia, or Scandinavian countries.

Based on this, I look forward to playing Sweden and Brazil the most, but I think in general I'm keen to play smaller countries (such as Portugal) which should be a lot less painful now!",22,1750084849.0,victoria3,8,0.97,False

1lcujsr,https://i.redd.it/1qgyl47iwa7f1.png,"In a World of AI, Human Connection Is Your Greatest Lead Source!","We‚Äôre living in the most automated era real estate has ever seen. AI writes listing descriptions, answers leads, generates social content, and even scripts follow-up messages. And while the tech is impressive, it‚Äôs also making agents feel more replaceable than ever.  


But here‚Äôs the truth most agents are missing:  
**In a world flooded with automation, being** ***human*** **is your superpower.**

  
Farming‚Äî*at least the modern kind I teach*‚Äîisn‚Äôt just about being seen.  
  
It‚Äôs about being known.  
  
Being trusted.  
  
Embedded in your community in ways no chatbot or algorithm can replicate.  
  
When everyone else is chasing speed, scale, and shortcuts, the agents who slow down and build real relationships will win.

  
The future of farming isn‚Äôt less personal.  
  
It‚Äôs *more*.



# What Tech Can‚Äôt Replace

AI can answer questions.  
  
It can‚Äôt knock on a door and ask, ‚Äú*How‚Äôs your mom doing after the surgery?*‚Äù

  
It can pull market stats.  
  
It can‚Äôt notice the energy at the local fall fair, or feel the buzz when a new caf√© opens on Main Street.

  
It can write newsletters, shoot listing videos, and schedule posts.  
  
But it can‚Äôt show up to a community event, remember someone‚Äôs dog‚Äôs name, or earn trust the old-fashioned way: by *being there.*

  
And that‚Äôs the unfair advantage most agents are overlooking.

  
In geographic farming, it‚Äôs easy to get caught up chasing what‚Äôs scalable. But the truth is, the most *valuable* parts of your business are the ones you can‚Äôt scale.  
  
***Conversations.***  
***Connections.***  
***Community.***

  
That‚Äôs the moat.  
  
It‚Äôs the one thing AI can‚Äôt touch, and the reason agents who lead with people-first strategies will become irreplaceable.



# The Agents Who Will Win the AI Era Are the Ones Who Show Up

  
While everyone‚Äôs obsessing over the next best tool, the smartest agents are doubling down on the one thing that‚Äôs never gone out of style: **showing up.**

  
*They‚Äôre hosting neighborhood cleanups.*  
  
*Partnering with local businesses.*  
  
*Dropping by with value, not just postcards.*  
  
*And they‚Äôre becoming the person people actually want to hear from, not just another name in the inbox or face on a billboard.*

  
This doesn‚Äôt mean ignoring tech.  
  
It means using it to support the human stuff‚Äînot replace it.

  
Yes, automate your follow-ups.

  
Yes, use AI to save time.

  
But don‚Äôt forget to knock on doors, show your face, and be the expert who *knows the people,* not just the numbers.

  
Because when a neighbor thinks,  
‚Äú*Who do I trust to guide me through the biggest transaction of my life?*‚Äù  
  
They‚Äôre not turning to ChatGPT.

  
They‚Äôre turning to the agent who showed up when it *wasn‚Äôt* about the sale.



# Tactical Examples: How to Stay Human in a High-Tech World

  
This isn‚Äôt about tossing your phone in the lake and pretending tech doesn‚Äôt matter.  
  
It‚Äôs about using tools *to buy back your time*, so you can invest it where it counts: **in your community.**

  
Here are a few ways to stay human in a high-tech world:

* **Host a Local Giveaway (with Purpose):** Partner with a small business for a prize, and use it to start *conversations*, not just collect emails. Follow up with a thank-you visit. Ask how you can support *them.*
* **Run a Community Survey:** Door-to-door or online, it opens the door for real conversations. People love to be heard and you‚Äôll gain trust just by asking what matters to them.
* **Start a ‚ÄúLocal Spotlight‚Äù Series:** Interview local business owners, teachers, community leaders or anyone with a story. Post it. Share it. Show that you care about the people, not just the properties.
* **Circle Back in Person:** After an email or mailer, knock on a few doors to say, ‚Äú*Hey, just wanted to introduce myself properly.*‚Äù The personal touch makes the digital touchpoints *stick.*
* **Attend Events Like You Mean It:** Not just to ‚Äúbe seen.‚Äù Be involved. Volunteer. Buy a table. Bring coffee to the organizers. Agents who contribute get remembered.

  
The best part? Most of your competition won‚Äôt do this.  
  
They‚Äôll lean back while you lean in.

  
And in farming, consistency and connection always win.



# Closing: Real Estate Is Evolving - But Relationships Still Close the Deal

  
AI‚Äôs not the enemy.  
  
It‚Äôs just the newest tool in the toolbox.

  
But if you want to build a career that lasts, you can‚Äôt outsource *trust*.

  
You can‚Äôt automate *connection*.

  
And you can‚Äôt delegate *showing up*.

  
The agents who will thrive in the future aren‚Äôt the ones with the flashiest tech stack.  
  
They‚Äôre the ones who build a business AI can‚Äôt copy.

So ask yourself:

* *Are you showing up in your farm?*
* *Are you building something rooted in real connection?*
* *Are you creating a business your community would miss if you were gone?*

  
Because that‚Äôs what makes you irreplaceable.  
  
And that‚Äôs what makes farming work, no matter how much the industry changes.

  
**So yeah‚Ä¶ AI is cool.**  
  
But being the go-to, trusted, real-deal local expert?  
  
That‚Äôs cooler.

  
Keep showing up. Keep doing the work tech can‚Äôt touch.  
  
Your future self and your future listings will thank you.

* Ohio State
* Oregon
* PSU
* USC
* Michigan

Ohio State (90% BCR) probably has the most raw talent but also is replacing the most, both in terms of starters and coaching. They had a 2 loss regular season in 2024 and have 4 very losable games in 2025 (Texas, Illinois, PSU & Michigan).

Oregon (76% BCR) has one or possibly two losable games (PSU and maybe USC). If Dante Moore develops well, sky is the limit.

PSU (61% BCR) has two losable regular season games (Ohio State and Oregon). They're ranked very highly in preseason, which with $10 will get a cup of coffee at Starbucks. Never underestimate James Franklin's ability to blow a close game PSU should win.

USC (BRC 59% BCR) isn't getting any preseason love, BUT it's year 2 for installing their version of the Raven's defense and they've beefed up their lines. If the defense starts to click, they'll be in the conversation, but also have at least 4 very losable games (ND, Michigan, Illinois and Oregon). If they don't gel, could be a .500 team. Really odd wild card since they have the talent to be good but could be lacking otherwise.

Michigan (BCR 56%) has three losable games (Oklahoma, USC and Ohio State). Oklahoma (BCR 73%) is very much like USC in that they are a team performing below their talent expectations. Either team could put it all together for a game and dominate, even if their season results end up mediocre. Michigan will sport likely the best defense in the conference so that will give Underwood some time to get his sea legs. If the line gels and we can establish a running game out of heavy sets, we will have the ability to beat anyone on the schedule. 

B1G Championship: Oregon (one or zero losses) VS Michigan (one loss) or PSU (one loss). The potential for 3 or more one loss teams is clearly there. Avoiding playing in the pointless championship game might actually be an advantage. 

Oregon, Michigan and PSU get in the CFP. I think Ohio State is replacing too much and has a bit of a hang-over despite being super talented. Illinois is on the outside looking in but has a very good season for them and plays spoiler.  

A fourth potential spot depends on teams like Boise State and if they can knock off ND, if Beck's surgically repaired arm holds together for Miami in the ACC, how much the SEC cannibalizes itself, etc. The Big 12 will slip in a team, but they don't have a single squat with a BCR over 50%. They belong about as much as a team from the current Pac 12. Wasted space. ",9,1750084596.0,MichiganWolverines,12,0.91,False
1lcueko,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lcueko/i_hate_how_i_look/,I hate how I look,"Y‚Äôall so I‚Äôm new on Reddit and like this is my first ‚Äúpost‚Äù or whatever and I just need to rant and get this off my chest. Btw I couldn‚Äôt really find a specific group to talk about this but I thought this would be a good place to post idk man

So basically since the day it hit me that I was ugly I‚Äôve been so damn insecure and like sometimes I avoid mirrors or I look in the mirror for like hours straight thinking about how ugly I am and picking out all my flaws etc. Thinking about how I look literally takes up my whole mind and I literally can‚Äôt function anymore without that horrible feeling of thinking about how ugly I am. It has gotten so worse that I sometimes avoid going out with my friends or family just bc I‚Äôm so ugly. I also have a twin sister and well I could say she‚Äôs the prettier one, I remember even since when we were younger she would always get compliments like ‚Äúomg you‚Äôre so pretty‚Äù or ‚Äúyou look like *some random very attractive celebrity* ‚Äú and it  just makes my self esteem even worse. And I really love her I mean she‚Äôs actually a kind person you know and it‚Äôs not that she chose the way she looks, like im happy for her but the comparisons between me and her just shatter me. Whenever we got ready to go out somewhere (like doing our hair, makeup etc) as we‚Äôd get going my mom would always just admire how pretty my twin sister was and would always compliment her.  She wouldn‚Äôt say a single word to me .

So yall probably get the idea of my struggle with how I look and something that happened  the previous week was my breaking point.  So like any other day I was feeling super insecure and I decided that I should go out with my family, you know get some fresh air, and I thought that it would just get my mind off of my appearance . So me, my mom and dad, and my twin sister went to this coffee shop. You know we just sat there and ordered some drinks until one of my dad‚Äôs old friends came up to our table. Me and my twin sister were bringing over our drinks to the table right as they came. So we went there and they didn‚Äôt really notice us except for the wife and she said hello. After that they left and we sat down. Later, me and my twin sis decided we wanted to get some sweets so we went up to the order place and as we were giving our order, my dad‚Äôs friend was just staring at us. So eventually he left to his table  and we also got our stuff and went to our table. So a few minuets later he comes up to our table and goes like ‚Äú omg I didn‚Äôt recognize the girls, they changed so much, I‚Äôm in shock etc‚Äù and then he went up to my twin sister and said ‚Äú omg you‚Äôre like soo pretty what the hell like you‚Äôre super pretty‚Äù and you know I‚Äôm just standing there awkwardly he says to her again ‚Äúomg like Arab beauty like you‚Äôre so pretty‚Äù (we‚Äôre from the Middle East) and as he says this my dad goes like ‚Äú haha don‚Äôt say that, cmonn they‚Äôre both so pretty, *my name* is so pretty too‚Äù and after my dad says that he goes like ‚Äú oohh yeahh you‚Äôre pretty too don‚Äôt worry‚Äù and I‚Äôm just awkwardly saying thanks, it was so horrible.

So yeah after that happened I just got even worse, like imagine you go out to feel better about how you look and then you basically just get called ugly. My dad literally had to intervene to make him call me pretty. And it‚Äôs not that I care about some 40/50 year old man‚Äôs opinion on my teen face but man I know I‚Äôm ugly you don‚Äôt have to rub it in

I‚Äôm so sorry that it‚Äôs so long, and if you don‚Äôt understand some parts I‚Äôm also very sorry bc English isn‚Äôt my first language. Please don‚Äôt make fun of me or hate at me bc I wrote so long, I really trusted this group to talk about this and I really hope yall will be kind.

Can you recommend a decent grinder + espressor combo in this budget of let's say 1.5k-2k EUR - which could help me pull consistent shots (as much as I'm capable off :D)?

I would not like to have to mod it.

(I know, a pro can pull decent shots from low end machines too, so I need to up my machinery so I also have a better chance of getting decent shots too.)",2,1750084310.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

[For the first few seconds](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1l775co/chhayagarh_high_spirits/), neither of us spoke.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, your lawyer‚Äôs fine.‚Äù The Envoy was as polite as ever on the call, despite the tragic loss of a jawbone. ‚ÄúIn fact, I‚Äôm not even with him right now. As I said, our barrier intercepts all communication to and from your Special Zone. It‚Äôs a trivial matter to spoof a call through that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy bother?‚Äù I managed.

‚ÄúWould you have picked up otherwise?‚Äù He did not wait. ‚ÄúWe know you‚Äôve been snooping around.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs only to be expected,‚Äù he interrupted, ‚ÄúHardly an offence. After all, no crime in knowledge. But you‚Äôve gone about it in a very sloppy fashion, I‚Äôm forced to say. Machinery of the scale you control cannot move without creating ripples. Small to you, maybe, but glaring to anyone who knows what to look for. The Intercessor knew almost immediately of your attempts. He found them charming, of course. ‚ÄòLike a puppy taking its first steps‚Äô, if I recall his words correctly. Nevertheless, in the future, I would advise more discretion, Mr. Sen.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted him to shut up or keep talking. On the one hand, every single word was new information I did not have. On the other hand, I did have a small ego.

‚ÄúWhy did you even call?‚Äù I sighed. ‚ÄúJust to gloat? Doesn‚Äôt seem very professional.‚Äù

He laughed: an easy sound that could have disarmed anyone who didn‚Äôt know better. ‚ÄúOf course not. Just a small courtesy of information. Extended between equals. No, the real reason is different.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell?‚Äù I tried to sound as nonplussed as possible, though the possible consequences of our subterfuge being discovered continued to run through my mind.

Were they actually taking it in good spirits? Or was this a trap for further escalation? Maybe both?

Bhanu stood nearby with a patient look, hands on the *gamcha* around his neck. He was ready for‚Ä¶ something. Orders? What orders could I even give?

‚ÄúWe understand you want information. About a certain man in a photograph you have. A photograph that rightfully belongs to us, of course, but you can keep it. We‚Äôre even willing to assist with your investigation.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have been looking for him for a while. He was formerly associated with the Consortium. Then, a few decades ago, he dropped off the radar. Went rogue. You must understand that one does not simply abandon an organisation like ours. The security risks are unacceptable.‚Äù

He paused, almost certainly for dramatic effect.

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt tracked him down yet. If we had, we wouldn‚Äôt be having this conversation. But we have leads. Leads we‚Äôre willing to share. It should be easy for you to capitalise on them with your unique talents. Provided, of course, you know how to use them.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre doing all this out of the kindness of your heart?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúAfter we mangled you and sent you running? You must be the most devoted Gandhian I‚Äôve met.‚Äù

He chuckled. ‚ÄúWith that sharp tongue, Mr. Sen, you should‚Äôve stuck with the law. Not to worry, injuries of the flesh are easily fixed. Those of the dignity are marginally more stubborn, but I am willing to overlook them. For the greater good of the Consortium. But you are correct: our help doesn‚Äôt come free.‚Äù

Now, the offer. I knew that, were Sam here, he would urge me not to make this deal. He hated anything and everything that smelled of Consortium. Besides, I had explicitly instructed them to drop all communication just last night. This felt so hypocritical that I was briefly tempted to run for office.

But what choice did we have? We were stuck in here. Any word, any instructions, any news could be intercepted by their blockade before it could get to us. I had the feeling that, if I refused, the Envoy had every means to restrict my ability to reach the same information independently.

Until we could figure out a workaround, we were trapped.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm listening, but this stays between you and me,‚Äù I finally said, fighting the bile that rose in my throat.

Rudra cocked an eyebrow at me. I pressed a finger to my lips.

He sighed and nodded.

‚ÄúThe words of a true leader.‚Äù I could not tell if his tone was sarcastic. ‚ÄúVery well. Our terms are simple: first, when you find him, he‚Äôs yours. Do with him as you please, get whatever answers your heart desires. But he must be kept alive and, more importantly, sane. Once you‚Äôre done, he‚Äôs ours. The Consortium has its own questions to ask our prodigal son.‚Äù

Easy enough. ‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù

‚ÄúSplendid. And our second, final term: we are given to understand you are holding a certain‚Ä¶ tourist prisoner extrajudicially under the custody of your local police forces.‚Äù

No use questioning how he had that information.

‚ÄúSince when do you care about the law?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt. Legally held, illegally held. Only affects the necessary paperwork. We need him released.‚Äù

Of course. No deal would be consequence-free.

‚ÄúThat man is‚Ä¶ subject to an ongoing dispute in my jurisdiction.‚Äù I kept my phrasing as vague as possible, though I had no way of knowing how much the Consortium already knew.

Even a child knew never to volunteer information unless they had to.

‚ÄúNormal or Para?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe dispute. Normal or Para?‚Äù

The silence must have given away my ignorance. The Envoy audibly sighed into the line.

‚ÄúIs it Normal, as in, did he break a law or offend a custom? Did he get into a fight, urinate in public, marry the wrong person, or default on a debt? Did he murder or molest someone? Or Para, as in, problems on the other side? Breaches of the Old Law. An insult to the ancients, soul promised to a demon, desecration of a shrine, scheduled to be sacrificed. Which is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúPara. He insulted and assaulted an entity. Blood price is demanded of him.‚Äù I tried to make my language as clipped as possible to hide how out of my depth I was.

‚ÄúOf course he did.‚Äù

His voice dropped into a friendlier, intimate tone, as if he was telling me something his boss didn‚Äôt want me to know. Classic sales tactic.

‚ÄúLook, I get it. I hate the guy as much as you almost certainly do, Mr. Sen. He‚Äôs a brash evangelist with a stick up his ass and a brain about as flexible as a block of lead. Who wouldn‚Äôt?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut?‚Äù Nothing before the ‚Äòbut‚Äô mattered.

‚ÄúBut,‚Äù he repeated, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a reason he got to be like that without all that nonsense being bullied out of him in school. Your prisoner is rather well-connected in some middle-to-high halls of the good old Catholic Church itself. Not by merit, of course. One of his uncles is an influential cardinal. A big cheese. He‚Äôs been out in the Vatican on official business, but he reached out as soon as he came to know.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre doing the Pope‚Äôs dirty work now?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure His Holiness cares personally about this matter.‚Äù He said the title with mock reverence. ‚ÄúBut a good relationship with the Church is essential to our global operations, and Cardinal Mercer is one of our keystone lobbyists. I don‚Äôt even want to imagine the kind of damage he could do if we can‚Äôt fulfil this favour he‚Äôs called in. So, please, let that stupid boy go. You‚Äôll gain more than you lose.‚Äù

‚ÄúI risk alienating an important ally if I can‚Äôt pay the blood price, Envoy.‚Äù I shook my head, though he could probably not see it. ‚ÄúYou want him free? Convince him to pay up. Once that‚Äôs done, he can walk. I promise.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the price demanded?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúOne finger. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù The response was immediate. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs non-negotiable.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that or his life, Envoy.‚Äù

I was honestly surprised. I had expected him to agree at the same speed at which he had disagreed.

I was no expert, but a finger honestly seemed like a bargain when dealing with such things.

‚ÄúPurity of form, Mr. Sen.‚Äù

The Envoy‚Äôs tone sounded legitimately strained, as if he could not believe he was being forced to argue this.

‚ÄúThe Church still cares about it in its uppermost echelons. They care deeply, official stance on disability be damned. The boy has to enter the family business someday, and he‚Äôll be shut out if he‚Äôs visibly maimed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking for an arm. One finger. It could be his pinkie.‚Äù

‚ÄúEven so. The Cardinal will not accept‚Ä¶ damaged goods. He hasn‚Äôt said it explicitly, but we know him. We know the circles he belongs to. No external damage can be visible.‚Äù

A pause.

‚ÄúNot even a pinkie,‚Äù he added, mirroring my words.

Now we were in a bind. I had snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù I kept my voice level despite my turmoil. ‚ÄúIf I anger this entity, it will severely affect my authority. My struggles with control will intensify. You said it yourself, right? My security is part of our collective security.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is,‚Äù he agreed, ‚Äúbut the security of that prisoner affects the stability of more Special Zones than one, Mr. Sen. You have to make a choice. Today. Our patron isn‚Äôt used to waiting.‚Äù

‚ÄúToday?‚Äù I could not stop the incredulity. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs unacceptable! We need some time to make a determination.‚Äù

‚ÄúTomorrow morning, then. But no more. After that, the deal‚Äôs off. Remember, not a scratch on him. Send him out, and we‚Äôll give you the information promised.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow can I trust that?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn a profession like ours, Mr. Sen, credibility is everything. The Consortium is the Consortium because we keep our promises. Because we build trust. No matter how much we might dislike each other for the moment, a deal is a deal. If anything, I‚Äôm more concerned about you.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be.‚Äù My reply was automatic and certain.

Its speed appeared to reassure him.

‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre making a real problem for me. You know that, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll figure it out. Consider it a‚Ä¶ test of leadership.‚Äù I heard that slimy smile again. ‚ÄúGood day, Mr. Sen. I‚Äôll hope to hear from you soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do I‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúCall a number. Any number.‚Äù

With a click and a beep, the line went dead.

I tried to put the phone in my pocket before I remembered I wasn‚Äôt wearing trousers. So, I handed it back to Bhanu.

‚ÄúTrouble?‚Äù Rudra asked simply.

‚ÄúBig trouble. It‚Äôs about the Man in the Cloak.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been meaning to speak to you about too. Don‚Äôt you think you‚Äôve kept him waiting long enough? The ritual was a good excuse, but another day has passed since.‚Äù Rudra ran a hand over his head. ‚ÄúI do not believe he will wait much longer.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right.‚Äù I nodded at the phone. ‚ÄúAnd now, I have a deadline anyway.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù

‚ÄúTomorrow morning. But I‚Äôll probably have to make my decision today. Whatever I choose, implementing it will take time.‚Äù

‚ÄúHm‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyway, I‚Äôd better hurry.‚Äù I jumped off the slab, privately surprised at how quickly I had regained both my wits and strength. ‚ÄúWhere did you stash my clothes again?‚Äù

I descended the hill in silence, lost in contemplation. Bhanu was always exactly two steps behind me, his gait almost silent. Used to being an unobtrusive companion. The sun had moved through the sky, but it was still not noon yet. Good. Every hour would count today.

Naru was waiting for me in the east wing, just as we had planned.

This would be a good time to mention that our manor was far larger than the part we lived in. The entire family now resided in what was once the north wing, reserved as the family residence for centuries. There were three more wings, arrayed around the central block, which was the original and oldest part of the house. However, save for a small portion of the east wing, which had been converted into a massive library and storeroom, all the other wings as well as the central block had quietly been abandoned over time. It had happened almost imperceptibly, as our need for the space no longer justified maintenance expenses.

At its full glory, the house could have housed and fed over six hundred people. Now, the renovated portion of the north wing could hold twenty at best. Of course, that was more than enough for our current occupants, including servants.

The library was as musty as ever when I entered, the smell turning my yawn into a cough. Naru looked up from one of the many hardwood tables, spectacles perched on his nose like a wizened mouse from a children‚Äôs book. Piles of retrieved books surrounded him, freshly cleared of their ancient dust. Looked like the research was still going strong.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? Were you up even later?‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúAnd here I thought I told a mean bedtime story.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that. Just had a few bad dreams.‚Äù I settled into a chair next to him, trying to manoeuvre past the precarious towers he had built to see what he was reading.

‚ÄúI see. But I still don‚Äôt get where you got this term from.‚Äù He tapped the scrap of paper I had given him.

It had ‚ÄòChildren of the Forest‚Äô scrawled across it in my handwriting. Beside it, three question marks in his.

‚ÄúI told you,‚Äù I lied, ‚ÄúI read it in the journal. The context made it seem important.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt would help if you showed me the relevant extract.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs possible.‚Äù This was true, if a little convenient. ‚ÄúIt seems pretty insistent on being meant for my eyes only.‚Äù

‚ÄúMmh‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶‚Äù He snapped the last book shut and replaced it on one of the piles. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking all morning, and it seems like my first hunch was the correct one. I can‚Äôt find any other thing the term could possibly be referencing.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Ogwe?‚Äù

‚ÄúCorrect.‚Äù He adjusted his spectacles. ‚ÄúThey are the only group of people relevant to us who are referred to in a similar fashion.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut who exactly are they? I didn‚Äôt get much out of you in the morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because you were in too much of a hurry.‚Äù He pushed over a plate to me: a few pieces of bread with jam, alongside a cup of coffee. ‚ÄúI save some for you. The least you can do is stop making *maa* worried that her grandson will starve to death.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible with her around.‚Äù I gratefully devoured the food, trying to push the thought of those claws scraping against skin to the back of my mind.

‚ÄúThe Ogwe people are the original inhabitants of this place, mostly still pre-agricultural. They once lived across most of the land where the village stands today. It‚Äôs said Raja Ahindranath established our family grove on their sacred land with their blessing. Their aid was apparently indispensable in our victory over the great evil that we were sent here to subdue.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut?‚Äù Again, nothing before the ‚Äòbut‚Äô meant anything.

‚ÄúWe used to enjoy good relations in the past. But then the village expanded, and there were land disputes. You know the drill. There were words, then fists. Eventually, they fought a small war with us. We won. They were pushed into the forest, where they now reside. There isn‚Äôt open fighting anymore, but we‚Äôre not friends by any stretch of the definition.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey live in the forest? I‚Äôve never seen a soul in there all this time.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey usually stick to their own territory, deep in the woods. But I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve been watching. The Ogwe know the place like no one else. If they don‚Äôt want to be found, they won‚Äôt, and they avoid us like the plague.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, how long have we not had contact with them?‚Äù I asked, a tinge of disappointment bleeding into my tone.

‚ÄúWhy do you need to contact them?‚Äù

Whoops.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt,‚Äù I quickly said. ‚ÄúWell, maybe I could. They seem interesting. But if they‚Äôre going to kill me on sight‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like that. We are not at each other‚Äôs throats or anything. Just‚Ä¶ be prepared for something between chilly cordiality and open disgust. Before he died, your father was heavily involved in mending relations with them. Perhaps the first Sen in generations they actually tolerated. But that fell apart after, well, you know, and your grandfather wanted nothing to do with them.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, there are ways to reach them?‚Äù

He gave me another sidelong stare. ‚ÄúSure, there are ways. They‚Äôre uncertain, and the turnaround time is high, but we could probably arrange a meeting. That is, if there was a reason. They won‚Äôt just invite you in to satisfy your curiosity.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is a reason,‚Äù I reluctantly said.

‚ÄúWhat reason?‚Äù Naru leaned in, face knitting into a frown. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something you‚Äôre not telling me, kid. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing important.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs nothing important,‚Äù he cut in, ‚Äúthe Ogwe won‚Äôt see you. That‚Äôs how they work. If you won‚Äôt give me proper cause, I can‚Äôt help you. So, talk.‚Äù

So, I finally had to relent, and I told him about Prime‚Äôs visit last night, carefully working around the parts about the Blooming One.

I knew better than to mention that thing. Naru would blow his gasket, and there was no use aggravating the family long after they could do anything about it.

He rubbed his chin. ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ Prime‚Ä¶ He leads the Spirals?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe speaks for them,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúor claims to, at least.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd he believes the ‚ÄòChildren of the Forest‚Äô, the Ogwe, have the key to freeing them.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was my impression,‚Äù I agreed.

‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù He rose from his chair and paced the room. ‚ÄúWhat could they possibly know about Consortium business?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt elaborate. Couldn‚Äôt. I guess they can only muster enough strength to be lucid for a short while.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo be lucid for a short while,‚Äù Naru repeated. ‚ÄúSo, they are naturally more intelligent than they appear?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey can speak in complete sentences. They reason and argue.‚Äù

‚ÄúIntelligent, then, and yet, whenever we‚Äôve seen them, they just spout some cryptic phrase and then attack. No talking. No reasoning. No recognition. Just bloodlust.‚Äù He ran a nervous hand through his hair, failing to notice that it knocked his glasses slightly askew. ‚ÄúWhat does that imply?‚Äù

‚ÄúMind control?‚Äù I guessed.

‚ÄúPerhaps. Or maybe it‚Äôs more of mind suppression. Maybe they are not directly guided, but‚Ä¶‚Äù He motioned with his arms, as if trying to draw what he was thinking onto thin air. ‚ÄúMaybe their higher thought is simply suppressed, and they revert to an animalistic instinct to hunt and feed. Then they‚Äôre simply allowed to roam free as part of the local ecosystem. A predator, stripped down to its barest essentials.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why would you do that?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúThe Envoy seemed to be implying that the Spirals are artificial life, or, well, paranormal life at any rate. Why not just, you know, lobotomize them from the get-go? It‚Äôs terrible design to create functionality and then do extra work to neuter it.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue. But maybe the Spirals aren‚Äôt just dumb weapons. They could serve other purposes. Maybe they are also used as scouts or soldiers, and so they need their intelligence. Maybe it serves some unknown purpose in their operation, even when it‚Äôs tied down. Or, well, maybe their creator simply enjoys the idea of sentient beings enslaved to his will. The Consortium seems to be a‚Ä¶ diverse place. There could be people of all stripes in there. Some monsters wouldn‚Äôt be too big of a stretch.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù I leaned back, staring at the ceiling, trying to think. ‚ÄúBut how does any of that help us?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt means‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt means that, if there is suppression or control, there must be a suppressor or controller.‚Äù

We both jumped as Sam pushed himself off the door. ‚ÄúWe missed you at the morning briefing, kid.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, uncle.‚Äù I gave him a sheepish smile. ‚ÄúI got a little tied up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you didn‚Äôt miss much.‚Äù He ruffled my hair and crashed into the seat. ‚ÄúWe spent all night probing, and it‚Äôs just as airtight as we‚Äôd feared. Nothing goes out. Nothing comes in. Even communications are on the fritz. We got some boosting equipment out and cranked till it screamed, and still, not even a whisper got through.‚Äù

He gave me a grim look. ‚ÄúOh, and don‚Äôt trust your phone calls or messages or anything digital. They‚Äôre injecting themselves into all our traffic. Watching. Almost definitely altering, if we give them a reason to. Say what you will, but the Consortium doesn‚Äôt play around.‚Äù

I winced. ‚ÄúYeah, I suppose not.‚Äù

‚ÄúEither way, Bhanu told me you were here, so I thought I‚Äôd eavesdrop a little. These Spirals claim they have a leash around their necks that they need to throw off.‚Äù Sam shrugged. ‚ÄúImplying that it can be thrown off, under the current circumstances. So, we‚Äôre definitely looking for some sort of control system.‚Äù

‚ÄúCentralised, probably, for ease of use,‚Äù Naru speculated. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know if Spirals reproduce, but even if they don‚Äôt, they probably won‚Äôt want to track down and monitor every last one.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, but our controller could be located outside the land as well,‚Äù I pointed out. ‚ÄúThat leaves us high and dry.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, fair enough, but why would this‚Ä¶ this Prime‚Ä¶ even bother if there wasn‚Äôt a chance? Clearly, there is something he knows that would roughly suggest this controller is within our reach.‚Äù Sam raised a finger. ‚ÄúPlus, Spirals have been here for a while. Long before the Consortium decided to reveal itself properly. Before we had any idea of what their creations actually were, let alone how they were puppeted. There‚Äôs no reason not to control the Spirals from on-site. Less lag. Less risk. And who could stop them anyway?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably more reliable, yes‚Äù, Naru agreed. ‚ÄúIf I were them, I wouldn‚Äôt want the leash slipping under any circumstances. Besides, strange transmissions would be more easily noticed while crossing our *Raksha Sutra*. Inside it, though? Strange things are part and parcel of life here.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, it‚Äôs definitely here,‚Äù I said slowly, gears turning, ‚Äúand if it were, I wouldn‚Äôt leave it lying in the open‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHence, the forest.‚Äù Naru smiled.

Sam returned a grin of his own. ‚ÄúBut you can‚Äôt move a leaf around in there without the Ogwe knowing about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, they know where it is,‚Äù I finished. ‚ÄúWhere to find it. Maybe how to destroy it.‚Äù

For a moment, the three of us just stared at each other.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll set up a meeting,‚Äù Naru finally said.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Sam sighed, as if he could not believe what he was saying. ‚ÄúLet‚Ä¶ Let Kirti do it. He accompanied *Dada* a few times in his meetings. He‚Äôs bound to have contacts that can make the whole thing go a little smoother. Time is of the essence.‚Äù

Naru raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou trust him?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do,‚Äù I said before Sam could answer.

Both of them looked at me, but I refused to elaborate. This conversation was between me and him.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the boss,‚Äù Sam conceded. ‚ÄúBut, for the record, and despite everything, I do trust him. He‚Äôs not evil. Just terribly stupid.‚Äù

Naru chuckled. ‚ÄúOh, speaking of stupidity, kid, how did your little rendezvous at the temple go?‚Äù

I told them everything Rudra had said.

‚ÄúSo, mostly what we had feared, huh?‚Äù He grew thoughtful.

‚ÄúIf not worse,‚Äù Sam grumbled.

‚ÄúHe said he‚Äôll try to synthesise the poison himself,‚Äù I reminded them. ‚ÄúIf he can pull it off, we may have a lead.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf,‚Äù Sam agreed. ‚ÄúOr he may fail.‚Äù

‚ÄúSince we‚Äôre going to the Ogwe anyway,‚Äù Naru said, ‚Äúyou should try and ask them about it.‚Äù

Sam gave him a sharp look. ‚ÄúThis is the wrong kind of information to give an enemy, brother. If they sense weakness, they‚Äôll try to exploit it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, but they have a vested interest in the protection of the land, like we do. I doubt they‚Äôd do anything to jeopardise our chances. Besides, their traditional medicine is known to be highly effective when it comes to spiritual healing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt had to be, to survive for so long in a place like this.‚Äù Sam sighed. ‚ÄúI get your point, but I still don‚Äôt trust them.‚Äù

Naru shrugged at me. ‚ÄúYour call, buddy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll cross that bridge when we get to it. For now, we have a more immediate problem.‚Äù

Before I could elaborate, Sam held up a hand.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think we‚Äôve had enough problems for the day?‚Äù

I sighed. ‚ÄúThis one is urgent.‚Äù

‚ÄúEven so. You can‚Äôt just keep piling more and more onto your shoulders. You‚Äôre the one guy we need in tip-top condition around here. If you break, everything breaks down with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúSam is perhaps a bit too carefree sometimes,‚Äù Naru jabbed, ‚Äúbut I agree. That‚Äôs enough for the morning. It‚Äôs been so long since you‚Äôve come to the village, and all you‚Äôve done is work, get beaten up, and recover in bed. Take a stroll. Look at the birds. Explore the place. Chhayagarh is not just your responsibility, you know. It‚Äôs also your home.‚Äù

‚ÄúI understand that, but‚Ä¶‚Äù I sighed again. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt feel like wandering around aimlessly while my very presence is putting everyone‚Äôs lives in danger.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust me, everyone here‚Äôs in danger with or without you.‚Äù Sam got to his feet. ‚ÄúBut if you want to work while you play, why don‚Äôt you come out on patrol with me today in the evening?‚Äù

‚ÄúPatrol?‚Äù I perked up.

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù He smirked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be like a walk, but with guns. We can do a little meet and greet, wander into the forest and see if anything needs hunting. We‚Äôll even get time to discuss that damned problem of yours, if needed. How does that sound?‚Äù

‚ÄúWill it be safe?‚Äù I persisted.

‚ÄúYou can hardly be safer than in Sam‚Äôs company,‚Äù Naru reassured me.

‚ÄúAnd I can take care of myself, unlike a lot of the people here, in case the beast does decide to come for you.‚Äù Sam shrugged. ‚ÄúIn or out?‚Äù

I gave him a smile. ‚ÄúSounds good.‚Äù

He grinned back. ‚ÄúHell yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow heartwarming,‚Äù Naru joked, clearing the books away. ‚ÄúNormally, I‚Äôd advise against eating in the library, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

I took a sip of the remaining coffee in the cup. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the *Thakur*. I do what I want.‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúSure thing, little lord. Just hit the lights once you‚Äôre done, will you? And whatever you do, don‚Äôt feed the third shelf to your right. It‚Äôs being kept weak for a reason.‚Äù

Before I could ask if that was a joke, they left, talking about something or the other amongst themselves. But even as I returned to my meal, the preacher‚Äôs face danced before my eyes, melting into the Envoy‚Äôs, and then the featureless dome of the Man in the Cloak‚Äôs head. I blinked hard, willing the vision away, trying to focus on the rich taste of my drink.

Even so, a heavy burden settled in the pit of my stomach. Ticking like a doomsday clock.

A grim reminder that time was the one thing I did not have.",2,1750084260.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

It‚Äôs not hard to find James Gunn‚Äôs office on the Warner Bros. lot. A huge, glowing Superman ‚ÄúS‚Äù symbol beckons from an entrance wall, visible through a glass door from yards away. Gunn, 58, is in his third year as co-CEO of the company‚Äôs newly created DC Studios, sharing the title and office with Peter Safran, who handles the business side of the operation. Together, they‚Äôre creating a new superhero universe around some very old characters, aiming to finally make Superman and friends (and family, and flying pet) truly competitive with the currently shaky Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Gunn is a refugee from that universe, after writing and directing his final MCU movie, 2022‚Äôs Guardians of the Galaxy 3. Superman, due July 11, is the first feature film set in the new DCU, and arguably one of the highest-stakes movies ever made, though Gunn despises that framing. He‚Äôs an unlikely studio exec, to say the least. He spent his early years trying every conceivable creative outlet: fronting bands, drawing alt-weekly comic strips, acting, performing monologues in dive bars. He also got a Columbia MFA and published a raw, early-aughts debut novel, The Toy Collector, finding a path to his true calling when Lloyd Kaufman, co-founder of famed B-movie purveyor Troma Entertainment, paid him $150 to write a screenplay for something called Tromeo and Juliet.

He was soon writing big-budget movies, from Scooby-Doo to Dawn of the Dead, and directing quirky films of his own, one of which caught Marvel‚Äôs attention, landing him the first Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014. With that film, he made himself an instant A-plus-list director, forging a blockbuster from a deeply personal blend of left-field humor, visual dexterity, and aching empathy for the oddest of characters, all scored with the cosmos‚Äô greatest mixtape. After the second movie in 2017, right-wing trolls unearthed some of his edgy early tweets, and Marvel fired him. They soon changed their minds, but the temporary separation opened the door to his first DC film, Suicide Squad, and his current gig. 

In a glass case in the hallway of his shared office, which once belonged to Frank Sinatra, is a full Superman costume, worn by the late Christopher Reeve; a Gene Hackman-worn Lex Luthor bathrobe is in its own case in the spa-size bathroom. Gunn sits on a couch with Superman and Aquaman action figures looming above him on a mantel. On the coffee table are various DC comics, among them one eyebrow-raising anomaly: a copy of the first Marvel-DC crossover project, 1976‚Äôs Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man: The Battle of the Century.

Supergirl, which is out next year, is wrapping principal photography. How much were you on the set?

Zero. Very little. I mean at the very beginning, but I‚Äôve been pretty busy, as you might imagine. I was really involved at the script stage, but then [director] Craig [Gillespie] has just been such a great partner. He‚Äôs just been doing his thing. You never know how something cuts together, but right now it looks amazing. It‚Äôs really cool stuff.

That‚Äôs no longer called Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, correct?

[Pauses.] I think it‚Äôs just called Supergirl.

Your Superman movie was first called Superman: Legacy, and now it‚Äôs just Superman. 

Yeah. I‚Äôm always cutting. ‚ÄúLegacy‚Äù was really ‚Äî we do something called a premortem. A premortem is you get together with your group that‚Äôs doing the project. It‚Äôs usually about a couple months before shooting, and you go, hypothetically, ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs an epic disaster, what are the things that we‚Äôre doing today that are going to cause it to be an epic disaster? Everyone here can speak freely.‚Äù The things you find on other productions are the things that people are whispering. ‚ÄúOh, God, I don‚Äôt know why they cast that actor ‚Äî he doesn‚Äôt fit the role.‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúThe production designer‚Äôs never on time.‚Äù One of the things I brought up was, it was called Superman: Legacy. Even though I was the one that gave it that title, I just wasn‚Äôt sure. First of all, I‚Äôm sick of the superhero title, colon, other-name thing. And then also it seemed to be looking back when we‚Äôre looking forward, even though it does have to do with legacy in the movie itself. And everybody was like, ‚ÄúOh, yeah, no, change it.‚Äù 

It occurred to me that this particular version of Superman needed a certain version of you and a certain version of the audience. Could 2010 James Gunn have made this film?

I don‚Äôt think the 2020 James could. Everybody knows I was offered Superman in 2018. They also talked to me about Batman earlier than that, but I was in the middle of Guardians 3. If they had come to me in 2018 with Batman, I would‚Äôve said yes. But, yeah, I just couldn‚Äôt quite wrap my head around it.

What had to change?

I needed the right way in. And that required time to think through a few thousand options before I got to the way that I thought worked. But I do also think that my life, and career, has been a gradual softening of the edges. I still like black comedy. I still have edges. But I used to like provoking a lot. And today, although I still seem to do it, I don‚Äôt really like doing that. In my heart, I‚Äôm pretty sentimental. I just believe in basic human values. I think Guardians of the Galaxy was a good starter kit for that.

They all had a lot of heart.

They have a lot of heart, but they do have their own weirdness and oddities and edginess, and Superman isn‚Äôt that, even though he does from the outside have a lot of oddness. A flying dog in a cape is odd. Giant walking robots, and kaijus ‚Äî that‚Äôs all odd.

But the very-good nature of him, this really strong belief in what‚Äôs right, sometimes perhaps to a fault, is what makes Superman who he is. And that is not Star-Lord or Rocket. That‚Äôs not a guy who‚Äôs angry or covering up his emotions. He‚Äôs pretty pure. And so getting to the place where I could write that character was a journey. In the past I would‚Äôve done it through making fun of the character, and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what I do here. I‚Äôm less afraid now than I used to be. I allow myself to be purely creative more than I used to. And I thought I was being purely creative, but a lot of times it was just anger releasing itself in another way. I‚Äôm less afraid of being goofy or sentimental, or boring or straight.

‚ÄúMY LIFE, AND CAREER, HAS BEEN A GRADUAL SOFTENING OF THE EDGES. I USED TO LIKE PROVOKING. BUT IN MY HEART, I‚ÄôM PRETTY SENTIMENTAL.‚Äù

I‚Äôve seen a bit of the movie, and there‚Äôs a very grounded interview scene between Lois and Clark that seems like new territory for you.

That‚Äôs a huge thing for me. I have long talking scenes in Guardians, but they are stuffed with jokes. And that‚Äôs not the case here. There‚Äôs funny stuff that happens in that scene, but it‚Äôs all situational. And so allowing myself to write that scene, which is truly about two characters and the different ways they see the world and morality ‚Ä¶ 

So you would‚Äôve had the impulse to make that more jokey?

Yeah. Horror movies and comedies are so comforting to a filmmaker, because if they‚Äôre working, the audience is reacting constantly. Even, like, people crying at the end of Guardians 3. But it‚Äôs also a rather selfish thing as a filmmaker. Because I‚Äôm not making something so that I can sit in an audience and be happy; I‚Äôm making something that really works on a fundamental level. So I have to be willing to sit there with an audience and not know if they‚Äôre liking it or not.

After you temporarily got fired from Marvel for some old tweets, you‚Äôve said a ton of friends reached out to you ‚Äî and that for the first time in your life, you had a transformative experience of feeling truly loved.

There‚Äôs no doubt that without that experience, I don‚Äôt think that I would‚Äôve written the Superman that I wrote. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt be doing this job if I didn‚Äôt get fired, but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd be doing this job even if it wasn‚Äôt for that. I just don‚Äôt think that a character that pure would‚Äôve quite appealed to me.

How did that open the door?

I don‚Äôt think that opened the door to me writing the pure Superman. That opened the door for me to stop creating so that people would like me. That‚Äôs downplaying it ‚Äî so people would love me. I think on some level, everything I had done came from a pleasing place.

A tap-dancing for the audience kind of thing?

That‚Äôs exactly right. Which came from that kid in a dysfunctional family trying to make everybody happy by dancing around. Literally that‚Äôs what my fucking career was; not in total, but it was a neediness on my part. A need to be loved.

And one of the most interesting things for me is my relationship with actors. How I got good at working with people like Chris Pratt is because he came in and I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúStop. You don‚Äôt need to juggle.‚Äù Same thing with John Cena. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to juggle for the audience to like you. You‚Äôre a fucking movie star. You just be present and be yourself and show that natural vulnerability that‚Äôs a part of who you are as a human being.‚Äù And that speaks to people. 

So you were giving that advice, but not to yourself at that point.

Really good at giving that advice. But not taking it to heart in a way that was transformative, which is what that moment gave to me. But again, I‚Äôm not perfect on the other side of it. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not still doing things to validate myself in some way. That‚Äôs still a part of me being a fucking imperfect human being, but my basic life choices are not made according to that.

Even you were initially worried about the idea of Rocket in Guardians. You said it would be like having Bugs Bunny with the Avengers. So clearly audiences needed to evolve to accept a flying dog in a movie. You paved the way. 

That‚Äôs right. Rocket made the world ready for Krypto. Although, in a way, Krypto is way more grounded than Rocket, because Krypto is simply a superpowered dog. He‚Äôs just a poorly behaved dog, which is what my dog is. So he‚Äôs really easy and fun to write.

One of your big innovations here is the sci-fi Silver Age Superman stuff ‚Äî robots, etc. ‚Äî that has never been in a live-action film.

Yeah, I think that‚Äôs the biggest tonally novel thing about this film. And it really is based on the tone of [2000s comic book series] All-Star Superman in a lot of ways. And taking that tone into a cinematic realm is not the usual thing for a superhero movie, or for any movie. So I really was thinking a lot when making the film about graphic novels more than movies.

Fantastic Four is coming around the same time as Superman and seems to share that Silver Age, optimistic feel. It‚Äôs interesting given weird times in the world right now that seems to be the right vibe.

Maybe. But do you really think they‚Äôre alike? I‚Äôm really embracing the Silver Age of it all, but I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs as stylized, or at least not stylized in the same way. And it‚Äôs not as retro. There are retro-futuristic aspects, because we‚Äôve got Daily Planet with a big fucking [globe]. And the robots, the machinery. So I can see where there‚Äôs certain similarities.

On a story level, what cracked Superman for you?

It was Krypto. The beginning of the movie is the first thing I wrote, with Krypto coming to Superman in the snow and Krypto taking him home. That really was about the tone of the whole movie. It‚Äôs a flying dog who wears a cape, but that led immediately to the robots, to the fortress rising from the ground, to the device that isn‚Äôt in the comics ‚Äî the giant magnifying glass, which powers him up more quickly than just the regular sun would. Bringing all those elements into a Superman movie in a way that hasn‚Äôt happened ‚Äî not to mention that he exists in a world where superheroes, or some form of metahumans, have existed for 300 years. It‚Äôs just a different thing.

I‚ÄôM LESS AFRAID NOW THAN I USED TO BE. I THOUGHT I WAS BEING CREATIVE, BUT OFTEN IT WAS JUST ANGER RELEASING ITSELF ANOTHER WAY.‚Äù

Eddie Murphy once told me that nearly every bad movie happens because of Hollywood‚Äôs habit of setting a production date before they have a finished screenplay.

Yeah, totally. Listen, you can do everything right and make a bad movie. I‚Äôm really compassionate towards people that put their all into a movie. I know some people that were my former workers at Marvel ‚Äî people who made some of the worst movies. There were people that were lazy and didn‚Äôt put their time in. And then there were other directors that worked really hard and maybe didn‚Äôt have the best movie come out, but they did everything they could. But I do believe that the reason why the movie industry is dying is not because of people not wanting to see movies. It‚Äôs not because of home screens getting so good. The number-one reason is because people are making movies without a finished screenplay.

And that‚Äôs one of the biggest rules you‚Äôve made for DC ‚Äî that they have to have finished scripts.
Yeah. We just killed a project. Everybody wanted to make the movie. It was greenlit, ready to go. The screenplay wasn‚Äôt ready. And I couldn‚Äôt do a movie where the screenplay‚Äôs not good. And we‚Äôve been really lucky so far, because Supergirl‚Äôs script was so fucking good off the bat. And then Lanterns came in, and the script was so fucking good. Clayface, same thing. So fucking good. So we have these scripts that we‚Äôve been really lucky with or wise in our choices or whatever the combination is.

You‚Äôve written hundreds of pages of material recently between the Creature Commandos animated show, Peacemaker Season Two, and Superman. Do you ever worry about exhausting the well?

If I do, then I‚Äôll go raise goats. I really am fine. There‚Äôs a lot of directors who get worse as they get older, and I don‚Äôt wanna do that. Or maybe I do ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs like, if it runs out ‚Äî it hasn‚Äôt so far. But who knows?

You said you feel like you were able to be creative without fear now, but at the same time, you gave yourself permission to be pretty creative from early on. You were working in all of these different mediums.

I had comic strips published everywhere. That was really what I thought I was gonna do when I was younger. I wanted to be like Berkeley Breathed from Bloom County. Although I was also really playing music at the same time, so who knows? I wanted to be a rock star, but at the same time I liked the idea of having my characters on bedsheets and stuff. I just was searching for a way to be noticed and make money. I really wanted to make a living as an artist, and then of course I wanted to be famous and all of those things. So I really was just trying whatever. And for me the whole [secret] was finishing whatever I started. It did feel like I had a bunch of half-projects out there until I was in my mid-twenties.

Was that linked to getting sober ‚Äî you finishing projects?

No, that was a sort of faith thing. When I was in school for writing, I had 51 first chapters of novels. And then at a certain point I just had the realization, which was in the form of a spiritual awakening, which was just to finish what you start. 

You had that revelation while you were ghostwriting a book with Troma studios co-founder Lloyd Kaufman, right?

That‚Äôs exactly what it was. I was writing the book for Lloyd. And I wanted to quit because it was fucking killing me ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt have a small ego, and I felt like I was doing a lot of things for Troma and I didn‚Äôt feel like I was getting any respect for it. And now I‚Äôm ghostwriting something that I thought was hilarious. And the more I was writing it, and the funnier I thought it was, the more resentful I was becoming. 

So I talked to Lloyd about ‚ÄúI think I gotta stop.‚Äù Which was crazy, because I got paid money to do it. A lot of this is really ungrateful of me. I‚Äôm not saying this in any good way, but I‚Äôm fucking driven. And that‚Äôs when I had that awakening, which was to finish what you start. And so then I went back and I finished the book. I still hated doing it. But the minute that happened, my life changed within weeks, literally within weeks, because that‚Äôs when I wrote [the 2000 indie film] The Specials and finished that. And instantly everything happened.

You‚Äôve talked about moments of almost spiritual visions ‚Äî not quite like the ones in your film Super, but pretty similar.

Pretty intense. Pretty overall encompassing.

And ‚Äúfinish what you started‚Äù was in that category?

A thousand percent. That one was what kept me awake for ‚Äî that one was long. That was the most intense ever.

What did you experience? What did you see?

I mean it‚Äôs really ‚Äî it‚Äôs long, but my whole life is based on that fucking whatever that was. I have no clue how long it was. Maybe it was an hour, maybe it was seven hours. But, yeah, it was really just aligning a lot of the things I believed about myself, about finishing what you start, about it‚Äôs not my business whether people think of my shit ‚Äî my business is doing what I do, and that‚Äôs it. It was my faith in God, which is a big part of who I am. And yet at the same time, I don‚Äôt think God really cares whether you believe in him or not. But I heard ‚ÄúFinish what you start.‚Äù That was like hearing the voice of God as if it was completely outside of me. 

It‚Äôs weird that you had a lot of artistic outlets and it wasn‚Äôt clear which one was going to pop off.

That‚Äôs totally true. And at the end of the day, I think what I like the best is directing, because I like the right-brain part of it a lot. I like the puzzle part of it. I like shooting action. That‚Äôs, like, my favorite thing to do. But yes, I never really saw myself as one thing. I just saw myself as an entertainer, for sure.

When you took on Spy vs. Spy and then Scooby-Doo, was that in any way a sellout move in your mind?

No. I don‚Äôt even think like that. If I didn‚Äôt want to write those things, then yeah, it would‚Äôve been a sellout move. But I wanted to write them. I was excited by the ideas, really excited. I loved Scooby-Doo as a little kid. I loved him. I still love Scooby, so that was exciting to me. 

It‚Äôs interesting that the guy who wrote The Toy Collector, about someone‚Äôs messed up attachment to the icons of their childhood, then takes on Scooby-Doo and then eventually Superman.

Oh, yeah. I guess so. I love bringing reality to things that I loved as a kid, and saying, ‚ÄúOK, if this was real ‚Äî if Scooby-Doo was real, if Superman was real, if Rocket Raccoon was real ‚Äî how would that be? How would they be real?

‚ÄúI RELATE TO LEX MORE THAN I WISH I DID. HE‚ÄôS JUST MEANER THAN ME.‚Äù

In the Superman trailer we see that Lois already knows Clark is Superman. So you bypassed one of the stickiest issues ‚Äî how does Lois not see past the glasses?

It comes up again later in the movie and it‚Äôs explained. She says it. We mention it. And it‚Äôs a one-off and people chuckle, but there‚Äôs stuff later in the movie about the glasses that are canon. That‚Äôs canon in the comics.

There‚Äôs a controversial Seventies issue of the comic book where it shows that Superman basically uses super-hypnotism to change people‚Äôs perception of him in the glasses  ‚Äî it was an idea sent in by a fan that has been mostly ignored since.

Something like that! I only know it from [DC Comics writer] Tom King. The first time we met was at Peter [Safran‚Äôs] house. We had this sort of writers group come in. One of those people was Tom King, and he was the most helpful. I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know how to fucking deal with the glasses thing, because it bothers the fuck out of me.‚Äù All that little stuff that people are like, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fantasy, just let it go.‚Äù I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúNo, I have to explain everything.‚Äù Everything for me has to come from a place where I believe it, as outlandish as it is. With Rocket, I could not just make it a talking raccoon. It had to have a real foundation for where he came from and how he came to be. And I needed to believe that.

What were some of the other things you felt you needed to explain to make this Superman work?

There are things that I know I don‚Äôt explain that I don‚Äôt even want to say out loud! But I wanted Superman to be vulnerable. I see the online things ‚ÄúWho would beat whom?‚Äù ‚Äî Homelander or Superman or fucking whatever, Adam Warlock or Brightburn, and I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúThis is the fucking stupidest fucking conversation.‚Äù Like, so then whoever would win this fight means that they‚Äôre the best? Because I‚Äôll just go out and write God Man, who can destroy you with a wink. And I win. I win all the fights forever. But I didn‚Äôt want a Superman who could punch planets. And also we‚Äôre creating a whole universe now, so what‚Äôs a girl with wings gonna do in the face of that? So he‚Äôs a little less powerful. [Green Lantern] Guy Gardner‚Äôs pretty fucking powerful. They‚Äôre all pretty powerful.

Honestly, in talking to people, a lot of people are like, ‚ÄúI like Batman better because he can actually be beat,‚Äù and I get that. So we have a Superman that can be beat.

There are people who‚Äôve been saying the whole future of the studio might be riding on this movie. How do you work in the face of that kind of pressure?

Really, I just go, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs their business.‚Äù Because that‚Äôs not the truth for me. My truth is this is the first movie out of DC Studios. Other people may say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gotta be a home run, nothing else.‚Äù I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôd be very happy with a double.‚Äù Fucking Iron Man wasn‚Äôt the be-all and end-all. It wasn‚Äôt Avatar. We are doing something that‚Äôs a piece of the puzzle. It‚Äôs not the puzzle itself. We have Peacemaker, we have Supergirl, and what we want to do is make a movie that people love, they feel connected to the characters. It‚Äôs just this one movie. It‚Äôs not everything.

I hate it when there‚Äôs a fucking article and it‚Äôs going on about all the problems and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and ‚Äúthat means even more pressure on James Gunn and Superman.‚Äù I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúGuys, I‚Äôm not responsible for all that. I‚Äôm responsible for my piece of the pie. I‚Äôve gotta make my budget back. I‚Äôll be very happy with that.‚Äù

You also cannot split planets, is what you‚Äôre saying.

I cannot split planets. Not that I know of.

Over at Marvel, they‚Äôve been pretty open about the fact that they realized what‚Äôs gone wrong over the past few years. They put out too much stuff. 

And [longtime Marvel executive producer] Louis [D‚ÄôEsposito] said that privately to me. I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs really their fault. 

They were under a corporate mandate, yeah.
That wasn‚Äôt fair. It wasn‚Äôt right. And it killed them.

Watching that, especially after being involved, are there lessons to be taken on your end?

There‚Äôs no doubt. We have to treat every project as if we‚Äôre lucky. We don‚Äôt have the mandate to have a certain amount of movies and TV shows every year. So we‚Äôre going to put out everything that we think is of the highest quality. We‚Äôre obviously going to do some good things and some not-so-good things, but hopefully on average everything will be as high-quality as possible. Nothing goes before there‚Äôs a screenplay that I personally am happy with.

Sitting on the table here is a Superman/Spider-Man crossover comic book from the Seventies. 
At some point, it feels like it‚Äôs gonna happen in the movies, doesn‚Äôt it? Maybe it‚Äôs 10 years from now.

We‚Äôve talked about it a billion times. That could easily happen, but simultaneous to that, I think it would be interesting. But I also think people are a little over it. I think people wanna see good stories with their superheroes and that‚Äôs what matters. And they wanna see different types of stories with their superheroes. And people love superheroes. That‚Äôs obvious, but they need more variety, and they need just more quality storytelling. And just having Spider-Man and Superman team up isn‚Äôt gonna do it if it‚Äôs shit. So it‚Äôs gotta come from a real place, and it‚Äôs really hard to make that work.

I did Superman because I loved the character. And I was excited about writing that movie. If I were to write a Superman-versus-Spider-Man movie, is it a concept I‚Äôm gonna be like, ‚ÄúOh, yeah, this could be a great film‚Äù? Or am I doing it because ‚ÄúOh, yeah, people want to see Superman and Spider-Man team up‚Äù? For me, it would have to be ‚Äî if we ever did that, it would have to be under someone who thought it was gonna be awesome and wasn‚Äôt just a cash grab, because I‚Äôm just not into that.

With this movie, you have people actively rooting against you because they‚Äôre fans of a previous incarnation of Superman and DC ‚Äî Zack Snyder‚Äôs.

[Fake surprise.] What? [Laughs.]

As you may have heard.

I‚Äôm trying to think of how to say this best. I don‚Äôt mind it. I think it‚Äôs good. I think you don‚Äôt wanna have everybody root for you. And I have an actor who reads everything online. I won‚Äôt say who it is, but he‚Äôll read this article, and he‚Äôll know who it is. It‚Äôs one of the top five in Superman. And this actor gets so upset over things that people say. I said, ‚ÄúFirst of all, you realize that the trailer came out and [reaction] was 97, 98 percent positive. These people help us, because you don‚Äôt want everything to seem 100 percent positive.‚Äù

It‚Äôs all right to have an opposing force every once in a while. Some of the things get ridiculous ‚Äî I just know that every time something comes out, it doesn‚Äôt matter how positively received, there‚Äôs gonna be something that is of great controversy. It was great controversy that the sun caused Superman pain. 

But that‚Äôs not what was happening. That was his bones snapping back together, right?
It‚Äôs like when a doctor resets your bone, you scream, but it doesn‚Äôt fucking matter. Because is that really a controversy? Is that really something that you‚Äôre upset about? Or did you have a hard time finding something to be upset about? There‚Äôs always going to be that. There‚Äôs going to be something that people are upset about, and it‚Äôs OK. This actor reads everything. He reads every fucking Reddit thread. He watches all of the videos, including by the people who make their livings by hating us. That‚Äôs how they make all their money. But you don‚Äôt have to watch their videos where they‚Äôre talking about how you‚Äôre awful. You can‚Äôt be reading it all the time. It‚Äôll fucking murder you. It‚Äôs a terrible thing to do to your soul. 

Is this actor your lead, David Corenswet?

It‚Äôs a hundred percent not David. David is Superman. He‚Äôs not a normal person.

What was your way into Lex Luthor?

I really understand Lex. I feel like I relate to Lex way more than I wish I did. But for me, Lex looks at Superman like artists look at AI. He is the world‚Äôs greatest man in so many ways. He‚Äôs done these unparalleled things. And then you got a guy who comes in who‚Äôs done nothing to deserve the ability to fly and to smash down buildings. And he‚Äôs also extraordinarily handsome, too. And all of a sudden that‚Äôs all the world is talking about. And that sort of obsession with being replaced, with being ‚Äî with your gifts not being seen or passed over ‚Äî I think is what drives Lex. I relate to everything he does. He‚Äôs just meaner than I am.

‚ÄúI HAD TO STOP CREATING SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD LIKE ME. THAT‚ÄôS DOWNPLAYING IT ‚Äî LOVE ME.‚Äù

Do you know what you‚Äôre writing and directing next? As far as film?

Yeah, probably. I know what I‚Äôm writing right now.

And it‚Äôs a DC film.

Yeah. Nothing yet. I‚Äôm just getting into it. I really have a hard time writing when I‚Äôm in the late stages of postproduction, which is ‚Äî we‚Äôre almost done, but I really have a hard time. I traditionally start heavily writing the day whatever my last movie comes out. I write treatments first, so I‚Äôm a couple treatments in.

You once said that the fact that Robert Pattinson‚Äôs Batman is not in this universe was Matt Reeves‚Äô choice. Does that mean if it were up to you, you would‚Äôve just pulled that into your universe?

It would be a consideration. We‚Äôd have to think about it. We‚Äôd have to think about it. It is not like we‚Äôve never discussed it.

It‚Äôs interesting, your answer is much more present tense than I expected. As if it‚Äôs an ongoing possibility.

No, I don‚Äôt ‚Äî Batman‚Äôs my biggest issue in all of DC right now, personally. And it‚Äôs not ‚Äî I‚Äôm not writing Batman, but I am working with the writer of Batman and trying to get it right, because he‚Äôs incredibly important to DC, as is Wonder Woman. So outside of the stuff that I‚Äôm doing in the projects that are actively going, our two priorities are finishing our Wonder Woman and our Batman scripts.

The Batman script ‚Äî is that still called The Brave and the Bold?

Right now, yeah. Right now.

In the broadest sense, what needs to be figured out to make those two properties work ‚Äî Batman in this universe?

Batman has to have a reason for existing, right? So Batman can‚Äôt just be ‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre making a Batman movie because Batman‚Äôs the biggest character in all of Warner Bros.,‚Äù which he is. But because there‚Äôs a need for him in the DCU and a need that he‚Äôs not exactly the same as Matt‚Äôs Batman. But yet he‚Äôs not a campy Batman. I‚Äôm not interested in that. I‚Äôm not interested in a funny, campy Batman, really. So we‚Äôre dealing with that. I think I have a way in, by the way. I think I really know what it‚Äôs ‚Äî I just am dealing with the writer to make sure that we can make it a reality.

And how about for Wonder Woman? 

Similar. Wonder Woman I think is actually easier for me, because there haven‚Äôt been so many infinite portrayals of Wonder Woman ‚Äî definitely not in movies, but really anywhere ‚Äî that there have been of Batman. Every single Batman story has been told. It seems like half the comics that have come out of DC over the past 30 years have Batman in them. He‚Äôs the most famous superhero in the world and the most popular superhero in the world. And people love him because he‚Äôs interesting, but also having so much of him out there can also make him boring. So how do you create that property that‚Äôs fun to watch?

I really should clear this up. Is there still a non-zero chance that Matt Reeves‚Äô Batman will get sucked into your universe?

[Long pause.] I would never say zero, because you just never know. But it‚Äôs not likely. It‚Äôs not likely at all. I‚Äôll also say Batman Part II is not canceled. That‚Äôs the other thing I hear all the time ‚Äî that Batman Part II is canceled. It‚Äôs not canceled. We don‚Äôt have a script. Matt‚Äôs slow. Let him take his time. Let him do what he‚Äôs doing. God, people are mean. Let him do his thing, man.

How do you want to be remembered? Have you thought about this?

I don‚Äôt give a shit. I want to be remembered that I was nice to my family, that my family and friends love me, but I don‚Äôt believe in any of that shit. First of all, everything‚Äôs a sand castle. Somebody wrote me that the other day. ‚ÄúWe have these problems, but that doesn‚Äôt last. What will be remembered forever is the movies.‚Äù I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúNo, it won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just fucking disintegrating with everything else.‚Äù What I really do care [about is] that I‚Äôm good to my wife, and I really do care that I‚Äôm good to my friends and my brothers and my sister and my mom. I went to the funeral of one friend a few years ago, and he was split up from his wife, but he hadn‚Äôt treated her well, hadn‚Äôt treated his friends well. He had stood me up three times, supposed to meet me for lunch or something, and didn‚Äôt show up. Funerals are always sad, but I think there‚Äôs a kind of fulfilling sad where people are crying because they love somebody so much. And then there‚Äôs this sort of depressing sad, where it‚Äôs like he just disappointed everybody, and it‚Äôs really hard for people to say nice things. We loved him, but it was hard, and that really affected me. I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want my funeral to be that.‚Äù So I guess I really do think about it sometimes, but in terms of that: I want people to cry because I was good to them.

She said it was so serious that she cant continue like this and if we can't solve it she wants to break up. We only manage to meet on the weekends, and once or twice a week during the week, but usually after 8-9 pm, and she is mostly tired and wants to go to bed around 10-11. I agreed with her that it could be better. We made a plan to block 1 night a week from friends/ hobbies, where we would meet directly after work and spend some quality time together. She agreed. I told her to put it in her calendar so she doesn't forget, because she is a bit disorganized sometimes. She told me she doesn't need to, because she will remember this time is for us. Great. 

The situation- Last week we barely had time to meet during the week. On the day we had our night together, her parents were visiting from another country. So ok, that is important. We dont get to meet that time and I am fine with that. Fast forward to yesterday- she asks me when we will meet this week. I have stuff to do most of the nights, and her too, but I assume we will meet on our date night (especially since she missed the last one), so I say that. ""What about {insert day\], as we planned?"" She tells me she can't because her (platonic) friend is going to be in town, and she wants to have coffee with him. I am kind of annoyed by that, but she explains that he doesn't live here, and it would only take a short time from our evening. I think about it, and while I am annoyed that it will not be as we agreed, I think that I should be flexible and understanding. Since I havent met the guy I propose a compromise- lets go chill in a park together, ill bring some beers and we can hang out a bit, I can meet the guy. Initially she agrees, but then later tells me that it wont work, with strange excuses about how he has to stay close to train station (in a small city with parks 5 minutes from the train station). So, he has enough time to come have coffee with her for an hour, but no time to meet me too?   
  
My reaction and feelings- I tell her thats really upsetting to me, and basically a kick in my guts. She deflects a lot and tells me something about how its no big deal, etc. I explain to her that its not about having the coffee with a friend. Its not even about having the coffee 1:1 alone without me. its about her lack of respect for our commitment (which was based on her telling me our relationship was not working). To me it looks like coffee with her friend is more important that time with me (""but its just 1 hour, I wll see you after""). For me this is horrible, I am very angry about it. I was willing to make a compromise, but she/they were not. I can only think of a few reasons why it wouldnt also be cool if we change the plans a bit to invlove me, and none of them are very nice. I bring all this up to her and I want an explanation. Eventually she just kind of tells me that she doesnt want me to invite myself to her things, again insisting that its not a big deal. Without explicitly asking for it, I was kind of hoping she would see my point of view and write to the guy saying ""hey, I made a mistake, I actually have a date night with my BF. "" But weirdly, that seems to not be of any interest to her. i did tell her this. ""Its just 1 hour coffee"" 

My questions-   
1. Do you all think this is as disrespectful as I feel it is? Do you think I am being controlling or rude by asking for some accommodation to be made? Do you think I am overreacting by thinking that this means she values coffee with this apparently platonic guy friend more than her relationship and quality time with me?  

And finally, would I be the asshole if I just broke up with her for this? I am very emotional about it so I might not be thinking clearly here. ",16,1750084246.0,AITAH,88,0.87,False

As you can probably imagine, it was a little awkward. Do we hug? Do we shake hands? She shook my hand, he went in for a hug, and then she went back and also wanted a hug. We had some coffee and cake at their house first. It's definitely not as grand as Emily & Richard's. I suppose that's nice, because otherwise I might have felt even more out of place. My mom and boyfriend were also there. We chatted a bit about all the memories from my mom's youth (the fun ones only ofc). My grandma then took me to the study and showed me an album of my baby pictures together with them. She let me keep it. It was of course mostly empty, which was kind of... yeah. On a funnier note, they live RIGHT NEXT to the golf court ü§£ like, you've got their house, their backyard, and then it's just golf as far as you can see lol. Afterwards we went to the golf club for lunch, and then we took a stroll around a section of the golf court. I still don't really know how to feel about all of it. On the one hand, they're quite nice people, they were excited to meet me, we got along alright. So it stung a little to see the album so empty. On the other hand, I know all the things my mom told me about them, things that happened, and they're not pretty. It was so weird, because I never had faces to connect to the stories, I would almost forget that the nice old people I'm having a pleasant conversation with are the same people my mom told me about. It's also so strange to call them ""grandma"" and ""grandpa"". I hardly even know them you know? I've always referred to them as ""my mom's parents"". It's just such a weird situation to be in. They are just two random people I met once, it hasn't fully clicked that they are actually my full on grandparents? It's also hard to just pretend like nothing happened. They all don't talk about the reason I haven't seen them. They never really resolved anything, they just agreed to disagree and ""moved on"". I wonder how long it will last. I think I want to see them again though, but it will probably be like once or twice a year? So yeah! That's the update üòÇ Sorry if it wasn't all that exciting!

1lcu8q4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lcu8q4,Montr√©al GrandPrix 2025 - Scuderia Ferrari HP Paddock Club,"Good morning fellow racing enthusiasts.

I wanted to take the time to describe my recent experience at the Montreal, particularly with the Ferrari Paddock Club. I‚Äôve been very fortunate over the few years to have attended multiple races and in different seating arrangements; ranging from the Vegas Paddock Club to the grandstands of Monaco. For those that have attended any race on the calendar, it is a safe assertion that race weekend can be a bit overwhelming with a sense of excitement. I‚Äôll do my best to accurately transcribe my entire weekend, despite only having slept 2 hours. 

Ferrari F1 Paddock Club (What is it and how can you get tickets?) 

Ferrari F1 Club program is a premium VIP hospitality package that offers exclusive access to the excitement and glamour of the race. As part of the paddock club, you are offered gourmet lunch as well as an open bar within the Ferrari suite. Regardless of whether or not you are a guest of a team or another paddock program; these amenities, Pit Lane walks and tracks tours come complimentary as a paddock club guest. We  will explore some significance differences between attendance as a guest of a team versus a general member of the paddock club. As a guest of Ferrari, a week prior,
you will receive a emailed version of the race program. Within that program, it contains detailed information and times around Ferrari pit tours, Ferrari driver interviews, pit lane walks and track tours. These experiences are incredible way to immerse yourself into the heart of F1 action. 

Hotels and Circuit Gilles Villeneuve
I stayed at the Humaniti Hotel Montreal Autograph Collection - only reason is that I am a Marriot guy. I really enjoy the property, they had themed F1 events throughout the weekend. Each day they had complimentary pastries and coffee, something I needed as I made my way to the track. My only advice is try to book your hotel lodging well in advance, for the obvious reason availability and increased roommates. 

Circuit Gilles Villeneuve - I took the ferry in and out during this weekend. I would go with this option over the metro as the ferry operated every 30 minutes and if you missed your time or wanted to leave from the track a bit earlier there was a standby line. I missed my times on all three days because of the foot traffic. Tickets for the route (N5) are available to purchase a month leading to the event. In terms of getting to the track, my suggestion is to always get to the track earlier than you want to, getting through track security and bottlenecks will take some time. To any Circuit Gilles Villeneuve newbies, regardless of where you are sitting, do anticipate a bit of walking. Especially walking through dirt, luckily this year it was rather dry and sunny  but it was muddy during previous years. 


Ferrari F1 Paddock Club - Experience 
Incredible. During the course of the weekend, we had 5 pit lane walks (50 mins each session) and 4 track tours. The first pit lane walk, they had CL‚Äôs car out on display and you could take pictures up close of and with the car. HOWEVER, you are not allowed to touch the car. The Ferrari team had to professionally and politely remind some of the guests to not get too close or touch the car. This is where being a guest of a team really shows its value, the pit lane walk come be a bit chaotic. There are a lot of people within this area all trying to get a picture of the cars and pit. As a guest of the team, we were let underneath the ropes and could congregate within the pit box of the team. Usually for people outside of the ropes, this obstructed a clear view of the cars. On a few occasions, if I noticed a lingering Ferrari fan or a kid who was trying to snap unobstructed picture of the car, I would politely ask if they wanted me to grab a picture for them, which I was more than happy to do. Note that this isn‚Äôt typical but I feel with the Tifosi. Track tours are a first come first serve basis, sign up as soon as the paddock club opens as this is an experience everyone wants to partake. 
Driver and Team interviews- throughout the weekend we had Marc Gen√©, Zhou Guanyu, Fred Vasseur, Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc come up to the club for some interviews. Amazing to hear their insights in voice and directly 10 feet away from you. Somehow was able to get an autograph from CL16. 
Gifts - at the end of each day, the staff provides you with a gift bag that you take home. They range from a few hats, a backpack, a duffle and a Ferrari leather wallet. I enjoy functional gifts so I am more than happy to have recieved anything, even an umbrella. 

Ferrari F1 Paddock Club - Staff 
The staff that runs the paddock club and are some of the best when it comes to curating a memorable race weekend and experience. They are friendly and welcoming, when engaging in conversation, you can feel the passion they have for this sport and want to ensure that you are taken care of throughout the entire weekend. At the end of the race, a few guests including myself stayed some moments to just converse with the team. When we finally left, the staff realized that they had run out of gifts to hand out. What had happen wasn‚Äôt so much a logistics/planning oversight, it seemed that a few guests might have just walked out with more than they were allowed to have. The woman that was handing out the gifts felt so bad for us that she actually ended up crying while profusely apologizing to us. We all understand how stressful this job can be and (guests and fellow Ferrari staff) assured her that it was more than fine and that she had done a great job all weekend. While this was happening, other members of the Ferrari staff were gathering items and putting together a small gift package just for us. This is just an example of the level of service that is the gold standard within the hospitality industry - they could have easily sent us off without anything and we all would have been fine. At that moment, the Ferrari staff made us and their coworker their priority and ensure that we left with a positive experience and that their own was taken care of.

1lcu6tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1lcu6tf/an_overnight_stay_at_the_hyatt_place_kyoto/,An overnight stay at the Hyatt Place Kyoto,"My wife and I are doing an 11 day trip in Osaka for the Expo, and decided to spend an expiring Hyatt Award at the Hyatt Place Kyoto. We have been to Kyoto several times so I wasn't too sure what I would do during this trip because we don't really want to go to the crowded places.

Hyatt Place far away Sanjo and Shijo and so don't have many tourists. During our last trip a year and a half ago, we visited the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden which was a good experience. I get to visit the State Guest house which was impressive. This is just few minutes walk from the hotel.

When we arrive at 1pm, the staff told us either we take a 2nd floor room, or we could wait till about 5pm for a 6th floor room. So we left our suite case and went for lunch. We wanted to go to the curry place we visited last time but unfortunately it was closed on Sunday. Looking around on Google, I found this soba place¬†[https://maps.app.goo.gl/3bsw1vz16iFK22oA7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3bsw1vz16iFK22oA7)¬†. We went there and surprising got seated right away. Wow, this place is so beautiful and the soba is so delicious. I think the food and the whole experience is better than this 500-year-old store¬†[https://maps.app.goo.gl/D4hosCzKbpqvWy3S9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D4hosCzKbpqvWy3S9)¬†which we also visited last time.

Then we stumbled upon this place¬†[https://maps.app.goo.gl/BRM3EWtfTtmxgmG88](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BRM3EWtfTtmxgmG88)¬†which sell incense and have an exhibition hall. It was interesting.

We then walked to¬†[https://maps.app.goo.gl/4uoqXHQi52nu1Y5e6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4uoqXHQi52nu1Y5e6)¬†owned by a World latte art champion. He wasn't there but the latte art was pretty nice on the coffee we ordered. But more importantly the latte and Roasted Nut Mocha were the best two cups of coffee I have ever tasted. Yes, it's just that good. I really missed the mocha but I could not explain the taste. This place was on my list which I didn't get to visit last time.

After this we went to Thisis(Shizen)¬†[https://maps.app.goo.gl/rgAwQHREMZouSPLk6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rgAwQHREMZouSPLk6)¬†for beautiful ice cream cone. The taste is a little underwhelming however.

We then headed to the river and walked on the bank. There we saw many restaurants with deck on a smaller stream next the Duck River. So we decide to find a place where we could sit outside since we don't usually come to Japan in the Summer, and we thought this might be a rare chance. It was easy enough to find one with and outdoor seat but the food form the restaurant¬†[https://maps.app.goo.gl/shs9VtZFJC77cPVe7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/shs9VtZFJC77cPVe7)¬†wasn't really that interesting. We also didn't get to sit next to the railing, and since they have put up bamboo blinds on both sides, we can't get a nice view. Next time I would probably spend more time researching before picking a better restaurant. There are so many restaurants on this side of Pontocho that have seats outside so it's not as hard to get a table as I first thought.

The 2nd day, we slept in and went straight out and arrived at¬†[https://maps.app.goo.gl/97nuJ3115QYutDxu6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/97nuJ3115QYutDxu6)¬†for curry. When we arrived at 11am, there was a short line waiting for its opening time. We only saw local people both times we visited. This time their special is called Lemon Chicken Curry and it's extremely unique both the ingredients and spices. My wife has the beef curry lunch set which comes with a small salad and small cup of mango lassi. This is our 2nd time here and we left super satisfied both times.

Going back to the hotel after giving up visiting the Nijo Castle because we didn't realized we needed reservation for the inner castle. So we checked out and went to the Botanical Garden a few stops North from Hyatt Place. It was 89 degree F according to my watch but it didn't feel so warm in the garden. And it's actually quite small compare to the National Garden and we have a nice 2 hours there. The green house also houses many nice plants. The nice thing is there are different sections inside the green house with representing different climates so we are not always in the humid and hot tropical climate. Even in the Summer, the Japanese maple trees are beautiful. So I could only imagine how beautiful it would be in the Fall. And the best part is, the place is almost empty. The soft-serve ice cream cone from the restaurant next to the North entrance( next to the train station) was also very delicious. It can be entered from inside the garden.

There is another place which I wanted to go but forgot all about¬†[https://maps.app.goo.gl/9PFQwAxeH7zpVsVi8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9PFQwAxeH7zpVsVi8). I heard the donuts are very delicious.

Without much expectation, our overnight stay at the Hyatt Place turned out to be a very interesting one. Slowly walking on Kyoto's street, we discovered many small shops, cafe and restaurant which looks cozy. We really enjoyed this side of Kyoto.

On the seventh slide that I have pictured here, ""The watercolour and accompanying text describe an apocalyptic dream which D√ºrer had on the night of 7-8 June 1525. The picture depicts a landscape with scattered trees. An enormous column of water gushes down, spreading out near the ground and flooding, while other smaller columns of water start to fall from the heavens. The dream occurred during a period of great religious uncertainty, with the birth of the Reformation, and many people feared that a flood would destroy the world.

Below the watercolour D√ºrer wrote a description of his dream:

The first struck the ground about four miles away from me with such a terrible force, enormous noise and splashing that it drowned the entire countryside. I was so greatly shocked at this that I awoke before the cloudburst. And the ensuing downpour was huge. Some of the waters fell some distance away and some close by. And they came from such a height that they seemed to fall at an equally slow pace. But the very first water that hit the ground so suddenly had fallen at such velocity, and was accompanied by wind and roaring so frightening, that when I awoke my whole body trembled and I could not recover for a long time. When I arose in the morning, I painted the above as I had seen it. May the Lord turn all things to the best.'

In the draft of his unpublished \`Nourishment for Young Painters', dating from over a decade earlier, D√ºrer had written: \`How often do I see great art in my sleep, but on waking cannot recall it; as soon as I awake, my memory forgets it.' But on this occasion, D√ºrer made great efforts to recall the dream and painstakingly recorded it in an image and words. The result is probably one of the most realistic early depictions of a scene accurately recalled from a dream, as opposed to more composed visions which had previously figured in European paintings and illuminated manuscripts.""

(In 2023 I found a Free Mason Family Heirloom Bible sitting on our bookcase in my living room my whole life from my Dad back in 2000, who attended a meeting once for an insurance client to get a customer.



I told my Father priest about this on the day of The Feast of Guardian Angels, and while my parents were out of town on vacation when I went into madness.



My priest gave me a holy water bottle blessed to smite Satan. With the book wrapped in a towel after touching it, reading 5 pages then, slamming it shut. An Angel appeared and took the book in the image. because I vacated my house thinking it was cursed terrified. He told me to douse the house with holy water to sleep & shower plus eat.



I got detained by my local police for disturbing the peace when getting into an argument with my parents, my Dad called the cops on me. At my house after they got home.



I was taken to the local hospital, by a police officer that heard out my story & gave me $100.



I took an Uber with the money he gave me after I got dropped off at the ER. Waiting for Secure Holding. The wait was 6 hours.

I went to my therapist's office in crisis and instead decided to go to the ER up there for me to try and get sleep medication because I hadn't rested in a week.



The medical staff at the hospital said they couldn't help me, or prescribe me any medicine. They instead diagnosed with me Anxiety Disorder and then discharged me from the ER at 4 am in 25 minutes. When it was 20 degrees outside, telling them I had nowhere to go; homeless. Other people were sleeping on the chairs in covers. (probably homeless too)



The Resource Security Officer started to threaten me. I started to argue with him, and I walked out.



For some reason -- My delusions, and hallucinations took hold of me spiritually. I was enraged by my self-evident situational outcome.



I filled up the Holy Water vial with water and marched up into the ER. Threw the water on the officer's face that kicked me out, and ran out. Getting away. Dropping my phone in the process,



I walked about a mile on the premises, into a building where I thought I was secure to catch my breath from running.



The police stormed in, and arrested me saying ""Hand's on Officer, Officer down"". Portraying that I assaulted the man physically with my body.



When I saw the Officer again he had red all over his face, I don't know what caused that. Maybe analgesic reaction

They took me to the County Jail, where I was put into Cell Block C, with accused charges to be arraigned of Felony Battery



I was met quickly with inmates checking me. I was punked being my size, and weight. Being in jail before, I knew this wouldn't be an easy trip.



Entering at exactly 7:07 the Officer checked when held for 20 minutes at the gates, with my confirmation Saint Maximillion statue in my possession in my book bag that they detained me with.

I was getting out alive determined.



Not understanding that the complex only allowed one five minute call per inmate each week without pay. Having no money in my account, calling my parents to let them know, before being cut off unknowingly mid-conversation.¬†



A despot inmate, after me sneezing once from likely dust being in the facility; Accused me of having Covid, and started a fight that began with him charging at me to pull me off the 6ft top double bunk I was lying in.



I jumped off, scared from the drop. Him all in my personal space and area. Tried to chase him out of my bunk, to then be knocked out. I sprung back up, after hitting the back of my head on a metal bench seat.

An inmate behind me picked me up and led me back to my bed. Where I passed out for hours.¬†



Awoke in the middle of chaos, to have to defend myself from the guards never noticing on the camera.

The place was wild, with people smoking weed & spice in the showers. Passing lines of Coke through the neighboring cell block doors.



People coming in, and multiple jumping's were being witnessed. Where these killers left other inmates bathed in blood and tears from head to toe.



I hid amongst the Fear of God with the other prayer group of inmates reading Bible study in the block. With rife Hell Raising gang members telling me now ""Don't press charges against him"", thinking this was the only way out of the block.



Being told ""I was lucky because they stomped someone to death in this cell block here two weeks ago""



Now knowing from other inmates if I went into the medical or the suicide room. I could save myself.



Talking to one of the guards about in the morning to check back on the cameras, honestly trying to get out alive with my life.

Going to medical to be evaluated for my wounds after being forced by a gang leader to leave the block or else, after realizing staying in the block wasn't my best bet.

They transferred me and put me into cold isolation, given food with no utensils. No toilet paper, for half the day.



Officers came to my cell, after my claims in medical. Stated that I charged after him, and the person trying to hurt me wasn't trying to hurt me ""On their million-dollar camera system"", now me being the assailant when I never touched anyone. Knocked unconscious, apparently ""I was never knocked out"", since I got up so quickly.



Then they tried to mitigate the situation by trying to force me to sign papers saying that I wasn't going to press charges on him when I was now being arraigned on more different charges, going to trial now for two cases. In jail.



In the meantime, while waiting, arraigned by the magistrate. I got my other charges lowered to A & B misdemeanors with a $500 bond.



Being moved into another block after medical & isolation, waiting until further notice. Realizing I was now transferred to the Sex Offender's block, behind two locked steel doors.



I was unable to call my parents, and now also I do not know my account login & password. The inmates in the other cellblock stole my paperwork, hacked my account, and took the other $40 in my possession that the first officer gave me out of my wallet into their commissary for coffee.

I was unable to manage to get an officer to help me for days, obviously ignored intentionally. Buzzing on the intercom for hours throughout the day to help me log into my account to make one final call.

Being only told over the intercom, that I was being moved back into the same cell block that I started in.

I lucked out, and they had to sanitize the whole block head to toe because somebody complained about lice being found in their bunk. Shaving our heads off, and making us shower naked in front of them to make sure no spread.

In 2023. This was on the week of the Hamas terror attacks.

I had met a man named Tony Martin. He was 7'3"", and I thought he was a real-life giant. He said he lived in my state, but it was over by a church with three crosses.

He was a strange old fellow and reminded me of a charlatan. Or even the Count of Saint Germaine.

He taught me alchemy by eating cooked broccoli and fish oils to cure cancer etc., showing me recipes to make and create solid gold plus jewels from glue, asphalt, wax adhesives, and numerous ideas.

He had it all written down for me. Before they confiscated all my paperwork, before leaving jail.

He was running around like a wizard, saying, ""Go back into the back of the bathroom, make sure you're alone, and check the inside of your sock, there is ""$1,000,000,000 piece of gold.""

Then, he would proceed to run back to the bathroom, pull out an imaginary piece of gold, and stick it in his pocket like it was a token to move him forward in his game of advancing next in jail, feeling happily successful with an achievement. Unhappy if you didn't follow in full spirit.

He said his brother was DEA, and I needed to move to South Africa because they were trying to charge me. I still don't know how much of that is the truth; I get marijuana hash sent from California in an illegal state.

He told me that he had never died and was forever old and ageless.

While my bail was being processed, I had the chance to read all of the Psalms passages from the Bible with him. After he saw me, he exclaimed, ""You're an angel!""

He was talking about the biblical prophecy of when Jesus returns, with just having two suns, and two moons in the sky.¬†

My name is biblical.¬†

He taught me all about ""I shall not want"", ""The tongue is harder to tame than a lion"", ""Be kosher and meek"", ""Don't make mountains out of molehills"", ""Your words kill""

He said his name was Melchizedek. When looking at the Biblical figure in the stories of the Bible, online afterward, at home. It says that he never died and is still alive to this date.

I believe, honestly, that I met an apparition, and that this was a real experience. He told me that I was ""Not sick,"" even before revealing my diagnosis to him, he knew who I was for some reason. Like he knew me better than I knew myself.¬†

He was draped in an all-white bed sheet over his head and was worried about the cameras plus audio recording that they were monitoring at the jail. He held in his hand a large Bible, that was different from the other Bibles that the other inmates had.¬†

***""A second biblical figure that is said to never have died is Melchizedek, the ethereal priest-king of Salem. In Genesis 14:18, Melchizedek apparently materializes while Abram is speaking to the King of Sodom, blesses Abram, and then, following the exchange of a tithe, apparently disappears, while Abram continues his conversation with the King of Sodom in verse 21. This¬†ephemeral encounter caused the author of Hebrews 7:3 to write concerning Melchizedek, ""Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life..."" contributing to the legend that Melchizedek never died.""***

He said that he was trapped in jail and that he couldn't get out for some time. An interesting theory. He said he had been in the system awaiting trial for numerous years, and I was his saving grace. They kept stalling his court date and moving him around. Trapped by a corrupted system and an evil, money-hungry warden. Looking around at the Hell on Earth, that facility was. I could honestly believe an institutionalized story like that.

He wrote down every bit of personal information he had: bank account information, logins, and passwords. He needed me to get him a lawyer. He got me my saving grace phone call to my contact outside who paid my bail, and he saved my life because I ran out of money for calls when my bond was lowered and posted.

I got out before I saw him ever again.

I managed to convince an inmate to give me a free 5-minute call, off his account. After two days. Telling me ""Never give up,"" after ringing me up a call.

My parents picked up, and I tried to calmly explain my situation. It ended in them telling me, ""We'll be there to pick you up in the morning, we're going to bed."" Hung up on.

I hadn't slept in 4 days straight, on top of the week in psychosis before. I wasn't eating food, only water fasting with Kool-Aid sugar packet water, because the food was inedible.

In the morning, before breakfast is served. I got my call to be arraigned on my second-coming charges, and then I was supposed to be moved back.

Walking in the hallway and into the elevators.



Passing another Officer, who had my RO (Release Out) paperwork. Noticed my face, and said ""Is this ""....., ....... ?"". The officer handling me was surprised feet away from the courtroom.



Walked me in and asked the Judge if I was ""Free to go?"", and the Judge nodded.

""He's free to go.""



I also got my first charge dropped after two months out of jail, and I pleaded insanity.

I tried to commit s\*icide back in May of last year, unsuccessfully. [My Father's Saint Christopher medallion (The Patron Saint of Safe Travel) saved my life](https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1kpqxj2/my_fathers_saint_christopher_medallion_saved_my/)

I tried to take my own life in my car by driving at 100mph + without a seatbelt into a tree that I missed. My knee caps went under the steering wheel, and I thought I had broken them.

But I was able to kick open my car door, which was jammed, and step out into the forest. Because my car's front tires caught fire, and I managed to grab my phone plus turn the car engine off.

When in the ambulance on Mother's Day morning, after calling my Mother that they were taking me to the local hospital.

I was met by my mother while on the operating table because I had to get stitches in my right eye due to a laceration.

After this, the Doctor said that the hospital's Priest wanted a word with me, without asking.

The first sentence he said to me was, ""Saint Christopher must've been with you, and saved your life."",

I said ""Yes"", as I agreed, and pulled out my wallet from my back pocket, and showed him my Father's Saint Christopher medallion that he passed down to me.

It was quite a shocking occasion, and a bizarre coincidence that he knew this before I ever said anything.

I walked out of the ER that night, without a wheelchair on my strength, with only bruised bones and inflamed cartilage.

When getting my X-Rays looked at further by a doctor the next week. I told him about what had happened, and he said that it was ""A miracle"" I survived without major injury. He said I could've easily broken my bones, and I told him that I walked off my injuries by walking 7 miles the next day to prove it to myself that I was fine. He was astonished, and he said I was fine then. Without having to come back for PT.

I remember hearing a woman's voice scream ""NOOOOO!"" when I crashed. Inside my head, and I presume that was Mother Mary. I remember seeing an all-encompassing white light also when my face slammed against the airbag and my glasses frames broke & cut into my face.

\-

Just this last month, on June 4th, I had court for my probationary hearing meeting, where I would accept my deal for my prosecution because of this s\*icide attempt that left me with 4 charges. 

The charges are OWI for having a marijuana metabolite in my bloodstream at the time of the crash, and Endangerment for crashing near a house that was 50 feet away. Paraphernalia, & possession of marijuana. 

I was originally pleading insanity, and was smoking marijuana again, thinking that just like my last case, I would be okay, and be exonerated for my crimes. Since it was a mental health-related being a s\*icide attempt. - My public defender failed to read the law in a 4 month time period, and set me up for major failure. He told my family that we were going to be evaluated by Doctors, and then one random day, just told us it's his ""Mistake"", and didn't read into it enough. The law was different, being in a different county & it didn't apply anymore. So I was unable to plead insanity. 

Headed to court now with marijuana in my system, and likely to fail after being clean for 55 days. 

I again read all of the Psalms to myself this time, just like it was read to me, which saved my life by divine intervention in jail in the story I told above with Melchizedek, and started on May 30th (The same day that my lawyer filed for a continuation, unknowingly because ""something came up on his schedule"") 

I would lastly like to point out that in my su\*cde attempt, there was this old cemetery next to it an old church that they changed into a now-smoking lounge. This cemetery, on a metal bar that has a sign hanging that reads ""SALEM,"" which I didn't connect the two points until after talking about Melchizedek being the King of Salem.

It was at a firm that sold flooring materials, hardwood floors, carpets, tiles and everything needed regarding floors; from peoples homes to industrial sized projects. 

My main job was driving a truck, delivering orders around. For the most part it was for contractors, but any paying customer could have their purchase delivered by me. Which wasn‚Äôt a bad idea because the weight of these materials becomes a triple digit number quite fast, especially the tiles. 

Every other Saturday (and when there were no deliveries) I worked in the warehouse. 
So, one saturday, a customer comes in, just your average Joe. I pull up his order, tell him it‚Äôll take me af few minutes to put it together and then I‚Äôll bring it to his car. The I jump on the forklift to get the job done. 

This was just a regular order, tiles for one room, mortar, grout and levelling compound. To paint you a picture, the tiles were half a EURO-pallet weighing about 500kg. Three bags mortar and two of levelling compound at 25kg each brought the total to 625kg. Then the grout, two bags at 5kg, and we have it at 635kg. 

I drive this out and the guy is standing next to his car, boot open. Before I can think of anything to say, he asks me: ‚ÄúCould you load everything in the car for me?‚Äù

To which I answered: ‚ÄúI have no problem helping you with loading, but are you sure you want everything in one go?‚Äù

Him: ‚ÄúYes, I don‚Äôt have time to make more than one trip so I need it all in one go.‚Äù

At this point, I feel like I should share with you that this man was driving a Nissan Micra which, for those who don‚Äôt know cars, is very, very small. 

So I informed the man that I could do as he asked but I first had to make sure that he understood two things. The first being that the car was not made to handle all this weight in the back of the car. 

He said he realised that, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a piece of garbage anyway.‚Äù

The second thing I needed him to be absolutely sure of was that by driving off with the car overloaded was, by law, fully and completely his responsibility as the driver. 

He acknowledged that. 

A few minutes later, a yellow Micra left; its rear suspension fully compressed, rear bumper almost scraping the ground and front wheels barely in contact with the tarmac.

1lcu14n,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolarUK/comments/1lcu14n/solar_inverter_with_bidirectional_ev_charger/,Solar Inverter with bi-directional EV charger? Excluding Tesla.,"I explicitly want 100%, local control of the system.

Is this an off-the-shelf possibility in the UK yet?

Have 18 panels of GivEngergy/Octopus with 8.2 KWh of battery powering the house for a few years now. Looking at second cars, bigger batteries etc...

Even letting Octopus, who are very good, manage the charging/discharging of my battery isn't really my cup of tea. Ideally I want a local installer who'd come and reuse the existing panels but drop in an upgraded GivEnergy inverter, 10+ KWh expandable battery and connected to bi-directional EV charger and then I'd go get my own car and manage my Octopus tarrif.

Musts:  
Bi-directional. I'm aware of things like Zappi, but it must be bi-directional.  
I can control the charging and discharging locally.  
Be in-stock, now.

Don't care:  
Cost.  
Single or 3 phase, rewiring. Either, any.  
Charge rate, not that fussed TBH.  
""Smart Home"". I have power monitoring on all sockets, I have electric immersion on wifi control to coordinate with my gas boiler when there's no spare electrons. I have Home Assistant and a local weather station. My \~25 year old Gaggia coffee machine is power monitered, mostly because it might explode at any moment but... you get the idea.
