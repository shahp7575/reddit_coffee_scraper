1kgvwfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreeceTravel/comments/1kgvwfu/i_hiked_the_menalon_trail_in_4_days_here_are_my/,"I hiked the Menalon Trail in 4 days, here are my tips","I have just completed the Menalon Trail and thought I'd share about my trip and give advice for other travelers! I hiked from Stemnitsa to Lagkadia in 4 days, stopping overnight in Dimitsana, Vytina, and Valtesiniko. I'll share some questions I had before starting and answer them so others can know what to expect.

**How much English is spoken in the villages?**

Definitely enough to get by without Google translate! People will greet you in Greek, but quickly switch to English when you reply.

**Do I really need hiking boots/poles?**

I brought boots and left my poles at home, and I think this was the right decision for me. I would definitely recommend hiking boots, as the trails can be rocky and steep. Some folks were I runners, but I appreciated my boots. Poles would not be overkill, but I don't generally use them, so I did not miss having them.

*Other notes about gear*

I don't want to list my entire packing list, but I will highlight a few key items. My backpack was the Osprey Quasar 26, which is a pretty average backpack with a chest strap and hip strap, but not a lot of support. It worked fine, but I would rather have had one with a proper hip belt. I did not bring a water bladder, which was fine, and I did not have the extra space in my pack, but I would have liked having the extra water. However, I did bring a life straw, which I used often to have a refreshing, cold drink from the streams that sometimes run along the trail. I wore long pants for hiking, which kept the grass and bushes from scratching my legs. I did see people in shorts, but I was glad I chose pants.

**Am I too ambitious trying to do it in only 4 days?**

Ambitious, yes, but not overly so. If you are fit and short on time, 4 days is enough to hike the trail. However, I do wish I'd done 5, if only for the social aspect. I met other hikers on my first day, but because I was hiking farther the second day, I was not able to hike with them the rest of the trail. I don't mind hiking alone, but I would have liked to be able to stay with them a bit longer.

**What will cell service be like on the trail?**

If it is relevant, I had a Cosmote prepaid Sim. On the trail, connection was spotty, but in the villages I had a consistent strong connection and could send photos, take video calls, etc, over data.

**Will I be able to pay by card most places?**

Yes, most places accepted card, like restaurants and hotels. Some small mini markets or grocery stores preferred cash, but I was never making large purchases there, so it was fine.

**What will amenities be like on the trail?**

There are occassionally monasteries, which will have bathrooms and water and may offer you coffee. There are also fountains occassionally, which I filled my water bottles from directly.

Overall, I had an amazing experience! I met other hikers, who were very friendly, ate the best food I've had so far in Greece, and saw beautiful landscapes. Feel free to ask any questions, and I will do my best to answer them!",1,1746620277.0,GreeceTravel,0,1.0,False

I’ve currently working in a cafe where I’ve been for 3 years now and our manager is leaving for 6 months of travelling but we aren’t hiring a temp manager as it seemed redundant since all the staff are quite qualified to run things smoothly. We are all currently on L2 and the big boss wants me to step up into the mangers role on L3 (basically doing my Current job but rosters and timesheets too) my question is, as a senior barista who has worked for the cafe for 3 years, cross trained to work kitchen shifts and fill any other positions in the cafe, supervise juniors, train new staff how to make coffees,run weekend shifts smoothly and order produce, bread, cleaning supplies and other groceries, assist with the seasonal menus and specials…shouldn’t I already be on L3? He scoffed at the thought of temporarily putting me on L4 and said that he would just keep me on level 2 if ‘that’s how I was going to act’ (regarding me asking for higher wages to do the rosters and timesheets). My manager has been a tremendous help in trying to inform him of all the work that goes on, but he is adamant I only qualify as a L2. 

Anyway, I have a meeting with him next week to ‘negotiate’ my pay and what he expects of me in the coming months, I want all the information I can get before coming to a decision with him.

Facing relentless persecutions"," Today I start studying the first section [Fierce and Relentless Persecutions Arise From Hatred and Jealousy](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/the-votary-ofthe-lotus-sutra-one-who-practices-the-correct-teaching-with-outstandingperseveranceand-compassion/). 

I am very excited! But first…

*Updates to “MY Fantasy Life in a Cult*

*I can see my week is taking on a new pattern. It used to be Coffee Hour, do our drive to Starbucks/Costco, back to the Office, work a few hours, and off to ice-skating with the Twinettes and Lori.*

*No more. Now we have Artie working in the office and who knows what he is doing—but nothing has burned down yet. Dee and I have been running to help the Maracles pack up and move. Yesterday we had the local consignment store take away all of the furniture (none of it is needed in the RV) and today we started emptying closets and cabinets. We filled many, many boxes and today they all get carted to the Warming Hut. Today we also begin cleaning the home and getting it nice and ready for the new owners.*

*You can judge people by the friends they keep. The Maracles have many friends, most of them indigenous, some of whom Dee knows since childhood. For me it was a real treat to meet more people from the community, especially those from the other “faction.” I don’t know too much about this gap between the two groups, but I have met nobody but wonderful people! Maybe contact and working together are the starts of the healing.*

Let’s pick up again on Sensei’s Gosho lecture! The section begins with some historical background:

>“The major persecutions number four,” says Nichiren. In the two decades following the establishment of his teaching, he had encountered four great persecutions that threatened not only his own life but also the continued existence of his community of believers. Needless to say, these were the Matsubagayatsu Persecution (1260), the Izu Exile (1261), the Komatsubara Persecution (1264), and the Tatsunokuchi Persecution and Sado Exile (1271).

Of course, some of our friends over the hedges don’t believe Nichiren or any of his self-described narrative is true. Historical revisionism? YKW portrays him as the person who persecuted others. Huh??? A solitary unarmed monk taking on the entire Samurai class and Imperial Court? Does this have any logic beyond the short circuits in YKW’s mind? 

Sensei continues:

>The Tatsunokuchi Persecution and subsequent Sado Exile constituted the authorities’ greatest crackdown yet. Nichiren was dragged to the execution grounds and nearly beheaded. His followers were treated as if they were traitors. The government repression was so harsh that even those who had merely listened to his teaching were subjected to severe punishment (see WND-1, 240).

Unfortunately, such tactics of repression are being repeated today all over the world.

>The four major persecutions clearly revealed the malice and brutality of those who schemed to do away with the Daishonin and destroy his community of believers.

Malice? Trying to destroy the community of believers? That describes Sgiwhistleblowers quite well. There is no physical brutality, but what other word can describe the tactics of YKW?

>With regard to the many other attacks and obstacles he encountered, Nichiren writes, “Minor persecutions and annoyances are too numerous even to be counted” (WND-1, 240). These included slander and abuse, false accusations and harassment, as well as his followers being subjected to fines or banishment. Persecutions of this kind, which the Daishonin describes as “too numerous even to be counted,” continued without cease, showing the relentlessness of his tormentors.

Of course, I have met nothing like persecution. But in terms of “tormentors” I have my three buddies constantly following me: the legacy of my addiction, the non-stop torment of my hypersexuality, and my [DDDPDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder) (dissociative disorder/depersonalization/derealization). “Too numerous to be counted?” Yup.

Nichiren’s grasp of his mission was so great that he downgraded his torment to “annoyances.” So I continue to talk openly and publicly about my conditions. I attend three NA meetings each week, I am in therapy, and I engage with other HS sufferers through the Reddit community and DMs. I am moving from the status of victim to that of victor. Phew! Annoyances!

The rapid summary is that of these 3, only George Howell is worth visiting. 

Gracenote only does 1 daily pourover and there are no real options for it. I’m sure that it can be amazing but the the day I visited, the flavor was largely flat (as if the grounds were too coarse). They also tried to hint for me to take the cup to go but I insisted I stay since I didn’t want the colder temperature to impact the cup. Most of their accolades were from pre-Covid so that is probably when this place was better. 

For Broadsheet, I know they can have good beans since I have ordered from them before but the cafe experience was pretty bad. They only offered drip coffee, and it cost as much for the drip as a pourover cost in other places. There was also only whatever variety they had decided that day. I would not return and I would strongly consider not ordering from them ever again based on this experience. 

At George Howell, the pourover is front and center on a menu and they had 6 different varietals when I visited. These seemed to be curated for those preferring more chocolate tones to those preferring more fruity tones. Additionally of the bean varietals they sold, there was both the lighter roast standard as well as a more medium roast for those that prefer that. As a slight downside, the service I got was pretty bad. On 2 of the 3 occasions (ironically the least busy) after the pourover was completed being made they waited several minutes to call my name to pick it up. I even had to remind them on one occasion. Of the 3 cups, I enjoyed 2 to be perfectly balanced and third to be more acidic so they were made very well overall. 

For those visiting Boston I would say George Howell is the only real option, and it’s good enough for you not to miss your home setup. 

Tl;dr - of the 3 recommended Boston locations, I only George Howell to future visitors ",2,1746619655.0,pourover,2,1.0,False
1kgvovk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1kgvovk/personal_this_is_a_desperate_cry_for_help_my_skin/,[Personal] - This is a desperate cry for help. My skin seems broken and stuck. What can I do or try from here?,"Hi all, just wanted to share my story. I am really struggling with my skin.

I (30M) posted in here a few months ago about some issues I was having with my skin, but deleted it. Unfortunately the same issues are still plaguing me and draining every bit of confidence and happiness out of me to this day. It’s the first and last thing on my mind every day and it’s taking over my headspace, it’s not healthy.

Some background: I had some issues with acne in 2020 but otherwise my skin has always been good. I started to look more into skincare and take it more seriously after having a bout of acne which eventually went away by leaving my skin alone completely. Between late 2021 and mid 2024 my skin was glowing - I was using a basic water based face gel wash by Simple and Neutrogena hydro boost gel cream (the old holy grail formula). Over these few years my was skin resilient, calm, clear, even toned, glowing all over and really healthy looking. Just smooth all over, very minimal redness and zero signs of irritation. 

I can’t remember exactly when Neutrogena changed the formula but I think it was some time in 2023 as that’s when I recall first seeing the new packaging. Anyway, I continued to use it and my skin continued to tolerate it well, no issues. Towards the end of summer 2024 I noticed a little more redness and mild irritation than usual, didn’t think much of it. I continued using it until one day in November, I did my usual routine with the same two products and within 10-15 minutes my face was angry, stinging, red and rash like bumps literally all over my face. A pretty severe reaction all over. I looked into the new neutrogena hydro boost line and found several threads on Reddit discussing the new formula, with many people having similar bad reactions to it. I binned it immediately and just bought a basic moisturiser by Simple (light hydrating moisturiser). 

For the next two months I kept on having mini flare ups similar to the first bad one I mentioned earlier. My skin was really up and down, some days ok, some days good, some days flaring again. I figured my barrier had slowly been damaged and compromised over time and that I’d developed some sensitivities to the neutrogena moisturiser and other ingredients that I used to be able to tolerate. My skin seemed unable to handle anything, even products marketed as basic and gentle. This went on and on, and it was around early January that I had another severe flare up after washing my face and moisturising with the Simple skincare products. I then tried quitting it all and using water only, which then caused my face to severely dry out and flake all over whilst still red and irritated. It was flakey, dry, rough, red, painful. It was in a bad place. 

Went to the doctors who then prescribed me fucibet topical steroids, which I used twice daily for a week. It rapidly cleared up all the surface irritation and within a few days of using it my skin was totally clear, but my face was red all over, as if the blood/inflammation was constantly just below the surface. I was dealing with surface redness and hot flushes regularly. I used Avene cicalfate+ barrier cream only, no cleanser, for the next month and got my skin back into a good place. I then stopped using Avene cicalfate+ to let my skin breathe and regulate a bit - all I did was rinse gently with cool water. I did this for a week or so and my skin was completely clear, albeit there was still some residual surface redness and flushing but it was improving a lot. 

Eventually dryness and flaking was becoming an issue, so I reintroduced a moisturiser (Simple light hydrating moisturiser). It all seemed to be going well and I thought I’d finally turned a corner, but after 4-5 days of using it, redness and irritation started to show up again. For some reason I decided to use a face wash again as I felt my face needed it (I had not used a cleanser for a few months), and it all went downhill again from there very quickly. Redness and itchy bumps and irritation all over. Went back to the docs and they gave me a milder steroid cream (Hydrocortisone) which I used for 3-4 days. Helped a little but not much.

For the past two months I’ve been battling with my skin to keep flares at bay, with the occasional brief spells where it’s all clear and calm. The redness seems set in at this point, no matter what I do my face is red all over in the exact areas I used the topical steroids, which I applied in an even layer all over my face. There’s a distinct different between the colour around my eyes and the colour of the rest of my face. Even the colour under my eyes has gone a slight darker purple colour, maybe due to the steroid creams being applied on my upper cheeks. I went back to the doctors about a month ago and I got referred to an online dermatologist where I could submit some photos. I was diagnosed with rosacea and some form of dermatitis and prescribed pimecrolimus cream 1% (Elidel). Hard to say if this has helped much but it burns and stings and makes my face even redder. 

My skin never used to be like this. I honestly can’t wrap my head around it. I feel completely lost and have no idea what the true root cause is or what the fix is. Im scared to try anything new in case it makes it worse. I’m not dismissing the dermatologist, there may well be some elements of rosacea going on and perhaps it was always mildly under the surface, but I know what my skin was like before this cycle of irritation started. It was consistently very calm and resilient. I find it hard to believe I’ve just developed a chronic condition seemingly from nowhere. My skin seems stuck in high alert mode, constantly red and reactive and hypersensitive to even the most gentle of products and even environmental triggers. My skin was once so strong and resilient - it would look great even when exposed to heat, cold, after exercise, any kind of foods, coffee, alcohol. I never had any worries when I was on holiday or out in the sun. I could tolerate SPFs no problem and my skin would glow after some sun exposure. Now it seems absolutely anything can and will trigger a flare up or a reaction. I’ve tried things like Vanicream, la Roche posay sensitive fluid, gentle SPFs. My skin at the moment can’t handle anything but it also can’t handle nothing as it gets really dry and irritated. 

I am anxious to walk in the sun or go on a sunny holiday through fear of making my skin even worse. My friends all want to book a week away to somewhere hot and sunny and my skin issues make me so anxious about it. I’ve never had to worry about anything like this, just going for a simple walk or laying by a pool or going to the coast. Anywhere where there’s prolonged sun exposure. I know we all need to protect ourself from the sun and limit exposure but the reality is it’s not so easy to stay out of it when you’re on holiday. 

I don’t know anymore. I just want to give up with it, it’s emotionally exhausting and I feel like I’ve lost a piece of myself. The part of me that was happy and confident in his own skin. It doesn’t make sense. It’s been so long since my skin was calm and clear for a prolonged period. I’ve read some concerning stories about how topical steroids can effect the skin and I wonder if I am still dealing with the long term after effects that they have on the skin. It sucks, and right now it feels like my skin can’t remember how to heal or calm down. I want to believe that this can pass and get better with time but I am really struggling. I can’t put my trust in any products to work for me, and even the products for the most sensitive skin seems to be too much. My skin is almost always red and itchy and stinging and warm and it feels like that protective outer layer of my skin has just been destroyed.

I know....well I'm pretty, sure I need to increase calories via fats and a moderate amount of protein. I say this because lately, after 90 min or so of working my energy seems to bottom out and I start struggling to continue. It's not that I'm tired or exhausted.... I just don't have it in me.
 Does anyone have any suggestions or maybe a different strategy in order to keep a calorie deficit and stay in ketosis while fueling my physical labor?
 Next month I'm going to incorporate turkey sausage into my breakfasts and low carb protein powder after physical labor and with my dinners.

We moved 6 hrs away 3 yrs ago. My hair has sucked since then. I noticed it was breaking off (thought it was meds at the time and stopped taking them.) and becoming dry/ course. (My hair has always been very baby fine and extremely soft. No dye and I don’t heat style.) It started falling out, thought it was my products. Switched and seemed okay, but had to do a big chop. Then 1.5 yrs ago it started falling out again, really bad. Equated it to surgery, but it kept falling out - now 17 months later still having massive hairloss. Went through another big breakage period during that time and still losing a ton of hair at every shower, despite being on oral minoxidil for 4 months. (Not a dread shed. Still just shedding a the large same amount every shower.)

Important to note, my husband’s hair has been falling out so much since we moved too. We actually considered mites at one time. My 7 yr-old’s daughter’s hair has had a lot of breakage as well, but not shedding like mine. 

We decided to test our city water. We live way out in the county, surrounded by farms on all 4 sides. Thinking maybe pesticides or heavy metals from all the chicken poo fertilizer. (Literally a pile bigger than our house they replenish every few days and spread for about 4-5 months all spring and summer. The pile sits right across from our driveway.)

Got a really expensive water test kit that tests for everything. Just sent it off, so no results yet. HOWEVER, it came with chlorine test strips and our tap water was WAY higher than our pool’s chlorine! My husband had a shower filter overnighted and I showered last night. My hair is in soft waves again! My husband couldn’t believe it! He kept saying it felt like my “old” hair. He is now looking into a whole house thing and reverse osmosis. 

Now, we had had a pool at our last 3 houses and I never had a problem with breakage or loss. But, I always rinsed it before getting in and afterwards. For 3 yrs I have been rinsing it with chlorine water, swimming, then rinsing it with MORE chlorine water. 

On top of that, WE DRINK IT! I know chlorine is needed to kill bacteria, but higher than a pool??? We go through a gallon of sugar free Crystal Light a day, plus my pot of morning coffee, and all drinking water. That’s a lot of chlorine to be consuming and bathing in!

I have a derm appointment at 9:30, so I will ask him what he thinks. Although, I think the guy is kind of an ass and he even said he was stumped to my hairloss. All bloodwork is fine. I’ve been tested for autoimmune issues, hormones still really good (tested 3 different times) and show I’m not in menopause (I’m 46 now), vitamin levels are good and ferritin was high. No hairloss on either side of my family. I’ve tried dozens of different supplements. I even tried a menopause specialist last July. She said she has seen a higher percentage of her patients complaining of hairloss in our region than normal. 

And that’s assuming there isn’t anything else in our water. 

I can say in the last few years, my hair has stopped growing as much, my nails aren’t growing, my legs hair aren’t growing either, despite taking a prenatal vitamin everyday. My eyelashes and eyebrows keep falling out, but a serum has been helping that. 

I don’t want to get anyone’s hopes up, not even mine. But if you have unexplained hairloss that you have never had before maybe test your water. ",1,1746619494.0,FemaleHairLoss,0,1.0,False

# It Was the Earrings

# From May Queens to sidewalk cracks, from Zeppelin to red underwear—our belief systems don’t always make sense. But they don’t have to.





I didn’t grow up noticing my dad’s superstitions. If they were there, they were stealthy—quiet rituals tucked into the background of daily life. It wasn’t until near the end of his life that I realized he had them too.

Tiny tics. Secret signals. Unspoken deals with the universe.

I’d already developed mine by then. The earrings. The routes. The counting. So when I finally saw his—recognized them—it didn’t feel like a revelation. It felt like confirmation. Like: oh, this is hereditary.

Turns out I inherited more than his light-colored eyes and mild disdain for authority.

Superstition has always lived at the edges of religion—sometimes overlapping, sometimes outlawed. The church labeled it heresy. The Enlightenment called it ignorance. But superstition endured, because it offers something both religion and logic often can’t: a sense of agency in a senseless world.

Unlike religion, superstition is often DIY—if you want it to be. No middlemen. No robes. Just vibes. You make your own meaning. Set your own rules. The universe doesn’t have to agree, as long as it plays along.

It’s baked into our wiring, really. Humans are pattern-makers. We survived as a species not because we were the fastest or the strongest—but because we noticed things. When berries made us sick, when the stars shifted, when one weird sound meant a predator was nearby. Superstition is just pattern recognition run amok. A side effect of the same brain that gave us calendars, religions, and QAnon.

But if DIY isn’t your thing, there’s a whole constellation of prefab options available: black cats, broken mirrors, walking under ladders, spilling salt, opening umbrellas indoors. Step on a crack, break your mother’s back—which, for the record, I still avoid. To this day, I walk around sidewalk seams like they’re landmines. I don’t do the salt toss, but I steer clear of ladders and have never—not once—opened an umbrella indoors. As for black cats, I give them a respectful berth, though that’s less about superstition and more about not understanding cats. I’m firmly in Dogland—a place of wags and transparency. Catland? That’s a moody, mysterious island with shifting rules and judgmental stares. I admire from afar and stick to my lane.

Or you could go full Zeppelin and worry about bustle in the hedgerow and the May Queen. Channel some Donovan and call it the season of the witch. Hum a little Albert King—""Born under a bad sign, I been down since I began to crawl""—and accept your fate. Or just blame everything on Mercury retrograde and your star chart’s moon placement. If music is modern myth, superstition is its secret track.

We weren’t always a religious household, but once my brother and I entered yeshiva—me at age eleven, already a budding heretic—we tilted observant. Still, our most consistent rituals weren’t always in the prayer book. They showed up in everyday superstitions disguised as habits: the coffee had to be brewed just so—any deviation risked cosmic misalignment. The towels were folded into thirds, then halves, like we were prepping for a linen-themed origami competition. We had a holy ten-minute window before we were officially late, even if that meant waiting awkwardly in the driveway for divine permission to leave.

And me? I’d walk on one side of the street no matter what—dodging construction crews, aggressive dogs, and suspicious puddles—because the other side just felt... wrong. Like if I crossed over, I might upset the entire space-time continuum. I once rerouted four blocks out of my way to avoid switching sidewalks. Did it make sense? Of course not. Did I make it to the meeting on time? Also no. But I maintained the fragile equilibrium of the universe, so really—who's to say what success looks like?

We weren’t invoking the divine—we were patterning. Trying to hold the chaos at bay with repetition, delusion, and a dash of deeply personal nonsense.

It started innocently enough—one shape traced on the steamed shower door. Then another. Then a whole series. Some were abstract. Some were words. One looked vaguely like a goat. I wasn’t just doodling—I was creating a steam-powered glyph system to appease whatever force had taken over scheduling my life. The logic? Unclear. The execution? Unhinged. I once spent ten extra minutes in a rapidly cooling shower just to complete a symmetrical pattern that had no meaning and no audience. By the time I stepped out, shivering and victorious, I knew it was absurd. But also? For someone who can’t draw, my steamwork was practically gallery-ready. And if I skip the second sock before coffee, I’m convinced a government agency adds me to a watchlist. That’s just how delicate the balance feels some mornings.

By the time I hit my twenties, I’d curated a personal belief system. I wore specific earrings to big meetings. I touched the outside of the plane before boarding. I held my breath at every yellow light. None of it made sense, but all of it made me feel... in control. Or at least like I’d done *my* part to keep the plane in the sky.

Then came the brain injury, and everything leveled up. What had been quirky rituals became full-blown systems. Not suggestions—requirements. My mornings turned into a startup checklist. Wake up. Make coffee. Feed Bear. Sit in the same chair. Use the same mug. Bonus points for doing it all in the same socks.

These weren’t routines anymore. They were scaffolding. If I skipped a step? Error message. Full system crash. Did I know it was magical thinking? Yes. Did that stop me from unraveling if I missed my mug? Absolutely not.

When your brain stops giving you reliable data, you start inventing signals. Signs. Patterns. Anything to restore the illusion of control. I built a whole psychic UX just to function.

My partner once caught me frozen in the kitchen, spoon halfway to my mouth, because I’d forgotten to wear my earrings that morning. He looked at me like I’d short-circuited. “You think the universe actually cares what earrings you wear?”

“Yes,” I said. “Obviously.”

Look, I’m not alone. Athletes do this constantly. Lucky socks. Game-day meals. Patrick Mahomes wears the same red underwear for every game. Wade Boggs ate chicken before every game for over a decade. Jason Giambi had a gold thong he swore broke slumps. Compared to that, my earring ritual is practically scientific.

We all have something. A playlist. A lucky pen. A pair of pants that *always* deliver. It’s not about logic—it’s about rhythm. Pattern. Assurance that we still get a vote.

Superstitions aren’t the answer. But they’re not nonsense either. They’re... navigation tools. Training wheels. Charms we wear to feel like we’re not just raw-dogging reality.

So yeah. It was the earrings. And the mug. And the playlist. And the chicken, maybe.

Whatever works.

Post-TBI, I don’t need to outgrow my superstitions. I just need to clock them. Laugh at them when I can. Name them so they don’t name me.

They’re not magic. But sometimes they’re enough to get me through the day.

They don’t save me. But they do remind me where I’m afraid—and how badly I want order in a world that doesn’t offer it.

And honestly? That feels pretty magical.

# Husband affair?

GreenBiscuit25 · Yesterday 20:33

im looking for a bit of clarity as I’m in shock right now.

i (f35) have been married for nearly 10 years to husband (41) we have a good marriage, we have lots of family time with our only child (son, 6)

husband usually works in the kitchen and left his laptop open, I jumped on to check a recipe whilst I made dinner and a message popped up on his work channel from a woman he’s mentioned before but rarely spoken about- I clicked on the message which opened up all their message history (probably not ok for me to do this but still)

anyway it turns out they message aLOT! Like just about every day over work channel- and especially the last few weeks- the tone is sometimes playful and flirty and sometimes just about everyday life/weekend- but rarely work stuff! A few things that stand out-

1. the tone is definitely flirty at times- her mentioning going topless in the park and him saying “tell me more”
2. from what I could gather they have set up secret hangouts (dates?!!) going for coffee and a walk- this all took place during work time but clearly took a lot of planning of diaries- both talking about being excited for it- keeping it secret from others (she even suggested they set up a fake meeting!)
3. they have planned another hangout in a couple of weeks to give them both “something to look forward to”
4. when he take about his weekends he never mentions me and she only asks him about him and or son! But I know they have worked together a while so she must know he’s married!

I honestly felt sick- he’s out with his mates tonight so doesn’t know I’ve seen it. I’ve spoken with my mum who has told me to confront him when he gets back- what do I do!

GreenBiscuit25 · Yesterday 20:55

Thanks everyone I just don’t know the best thing to do?

1. confront him tonight and have it out- tell him what I’ve seen and demand answers
2. sleep on it- maybe write down what I want to say and think about it more and talk more calmly tomorrow
3. leave it for now- see how it plays out- eg if he had this next meet up planned see what he gets up to? But maybe I won’t be able to get back on his teams again!

part of me feels this is already serious enough to consider telling him to leave at least temporarily as it feels so blatant

GreenBiscuit25 · Today 07:46

Hi all-

thanks again for your replies- I’m still wrapping my head around this and didn’t confront him last night- I did screenshot some of the messages and read them again.

shes a single parent to two kids and also about 10 years younger than him-

it does seem like all the communication is on work channels unless he’s deleting stuff from his phone as she’s not even a contact in there?  
but it feels partly that’s how they are justifying this is it’s all during work time so is ok!  
also the messages just really got to me- how often they are messaging, how much they know about each others lives, kids etc  
little pet names for each other and he calls her mischief and a distraction and says after she made the topless comment he didn’t get any work done that day and it was all her fault!  
she also leans into this- encouraging him and using lots of smilies etc!

I feel like I’m married to a 45 year old teenager with a secret crush, instant messaging and planning dates whilst i am holding the fort at home.

atill not sure what to do next, going to sit on it today and speak to my mum again. Thanks agaain to everyone who’s commented

- I’m still using NRT. I alternate between gum and lozenges. I’ve dropped down to the minimum strength on both. I’m doing perhaps half a pacer of gum a day. I’ll stick with this through to 5-6 months and start to back off that. I’d rather use this indefinitely than smoke. 

- I joined a strength and conditioning class and do 3 sessions a week. It’s hard work - lifting has never been my thing. I find it humbling and challenging but I will get to deadlifts. Doing this keeps me not wanting to smoke - financially and physically. 

- my moods have settled. I’m not as grumpy or upset by the simplest of things going “wrong”. 

- I’ve not ran much. The lifting is exhausting. I’ll work that back in soon. 

- I’m tired. I don’t know if this is the no smoking or the new exercise but I’m going to bed earlier. Less stimulate perhaps.. relating to…

1kgvisd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kgvisd/should_you_buy_apple_airpods_4_wireless_earbuds/,Should You Buy Apple AirPods 4 Wireless Earbuds Review Sound Quality and Battery Life?,"Testing out the Apple MXP63LL/A AirPods 4 Wireless Earbuds on a busy, chaotic Tuesday morning was something of a revelation. These sleek earbuds have claimed a prime spot in my daily routine thanks to their compact design, impressive sound quality, and user-friendly functionality. While I came away mostly impressed, there are a few aspects worth highlighting for potential buyers.

**Superior Comfort and Design**  
From the first moment I placed these in my ears, I noticed their updated design. The shorter stem and contoured shape provide a surprisingly snug and stable fit, even during a jog or while cycling through morning emails. They sit light as a feather, making them comfortable enough to wear all day. That said, I noticed they might not be ideal for those with particularly small ear canals. The design seems to cater better to average-sized ears, and finding the perfect fit might take some trial and error.  

[Check Apple MXP63LL/A AirPods 4 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0dghmnq5z/)

**Immersive Spatial Audio**  
With Personalized Spatial Audio, my music-listening experience was elevated. This feature produces a theater-like sound, with dynamic head tracking that makes you feel like you're surrounded by rich, multi-dimensional audio. It’s great during activities like gaming or watching movies on my iPad, where every sound feels deliberate and precise. However, I noticed marginal inconsistency with sound quality across apps; for instance, some streaming platforms seemed to showcase this feature better than others.  

**Fantastic Call Quality for Busy Environments**  
Using these earbuds outdoors or in noisy coffee shops truly showcased their strengths. Leveraging Apple’s H2 chip and voice isolation technology, they managed to focus on my voice while reducing interrupting background sounds. A quick call with my colleague confirmed this — no need for me to repeat myself or speak louder than usual. However, environmental noise like heavy winds still presented minor challenges, cutting through during certain calls.  

**Durability and Water Resistance**  
After a sweaty workout and three unexpected rain drizzles this month, I’m happy to report these earbuds aren’t just sleek but designed for endurance. They come with an IP54 rating, offering reliable resistance to sweat and light rain. I don’t plan to swim with them anytime soon, but it’s reassuring to know they can handle Mother Nature’s mood swings.  

**Good Points**  
- Sleek and lightweight design built for all-day wear.  
- Personalized Spatial Audio delivers an immersive experience for music, gaming, and videos.  
- Effective noise isolation function makes phone calls a breeze.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Some users with smaller ears might struggle to achieve the perfect fit.  
- Sound quality for Spatial Audio varies depending on the streaming service or app.  

**Battery Life and Charging Case Redesign**  
Battery life has been a solid performer. On a full charge, I got up to five hours of listening time, which stretched to 30 hours with the charging case. Speaking of the case, it’s undergone a refreshing redesign, shedding 10% of its bulk for a sleeker, pocket-friendly look. The USB-C compatibility is a step forward, but long-time Apple users might find it inconvenient if they’re still stocked with older Lightning cables. Invest in a USB-C cable if you’re updating.  

**Competing Brands**  
When compared to the likes of Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro and Sony WF-1000XM4, the AirPods 4 hold their ground in key ways. Samsung’s earbuds offer tighter noise cancellation, but Apple’s Spatial Audio is unmatched for theater-like sound. Sony’s earbuds provide slightly longer battery life, but they lack in seamless device pairing. The ecosystem magic with the AirPods syncing quickly with an iPhone or MacBook is worth spotlighting.  

**Budget-Friendly Bargain?**  
Though the Apple MXP63LL/A AirPods 4 don’t come cheap, their performance and seamless integration into the Apple ecosystem make them a worthwhile splurge. Investing in these is more than just purchasing earbuds — it’s like onboarding a daily-use, multi-functioning gadget. The long battery life and robust sound justify the cost, even if you hold off buying additional cables.

I spend a good amount of time in the kitchen, both cooking and hydrating throughout the day, so clean and safe water isn’t just a luxury, it’s a necessity. I wanted a filtration system that didn’t involve drilling holes or wrangling with plumbing, and this filter seemed promising. After using it for a couple of weeks, I can confidently say it lives up to a lot of the hype…but not without its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that drew me in about this filter was its compact and sleek stainless steel design. It looks sturdy, and the fact that it’s crafted from 304 food-grade, BPA-free stainless steel instead of the usual flimsy plastic instilled confidence. This is a significant upgrade from the plastic filter I used previously, which cracked after a few months. The stainless steel not only looks good sitting under my sink but has also stood up to incidental bumps without a single dent or scratch. Plus, it’s resistant to corrosion, meaning it feels like something that’s built to last.

While I’ve had no issues with leaks thanks to the high-quality material and good connectors included in the box, I can’t ignore its weight. Weighing in at 5.2 pounds, it’s heavier than some competitors, so it’s something to keep in mind if space and weight limitations are a concern.  

**Ease of Installation**

For someone like me who avoids tools at all costs, installing this filtration system was surprisingly simple. No drilling, no special tools, and no expensive plumber visits were required. It connects directly to the cold-water line under most standard U.S. kitchen or bathroom sinks with a 3/8"" or 1/2"" fitting adapter included in the package. It didn’t take me more than 10 minutes to install it with the help of the clear instructions provided. I even felt a little smug afterwards – how often do you get to feel like a pro handyman?

That said, if your plumbing deviates from the standard U.S. fittings, you may face compatibility hiccups. Some other reviewers mentioned struggling to find connectors for more unconventional setups.  

**Check SimPure V7 price on Amazon.**

**Filtration Performance**

This is where the SimPure V7 filter really shines. The five-stage system featuring dual sediment membranes, KDF-55, and dual-activated carbon removes up to 99% of lead, chlorine, and other impurities, all while maintaining healthy minerals. The water tastes clean and fresh, and even my coffee seems to have a purer flavor. I didn’t realize how much difference filtered water could make in cooking until I tried pasta and soup using water purified by this system.

However, if you’re looking for a filter that lowers TDS (Total Dissolved Solids), this isn’t it. The manufacturer explicitly notes that it doesn’t lower TDS, which is essential to consider if that’s a requirement for you. For ultra-pure water, a reverse osmosis system might be a better choice.

**High Flow Rate and Capacity**

One of the biggest perks I’ve found is the high water flow rate. With a maximum of 1.6 gallons per minute, I no longer have to wait forever to fill a pitcher or pot, which was a major complaint I had with my previous under-sink filter. You also get up to 20,000 gallons of filtration or 12 months of use before needing a replacement, so I know I won’t have to fuss with it any time soon. For a family, this could be a game changer, especially if you’re constantly using the tap like I am.

**Merits**

- Durable stainless steel design resistant to corrosion and leaks  
- Easy installation with no drilling or expensive tools needed  
- High flow rate (1.6 GPM) – no annoying waits  
- Long-lasting filter capacity suitable for heavy use  
- Does not remove healthy minerals from water  

**Areas for Improvement**

- Does not lower TDS; unsuitable for anyone prioritizing ultra-low dissolved solids  
- Compatibility issues may arise with non-standard plumbing systems  
- Heavier than plastic alternatives, which may be inconvenient for some setups  

**Competing Products**

When comparing this under-sink filter to others on the market, a couple of competitors stand out. For example, some budget-friendly plastic filters like the Culligan EZ-Change offer similar installation flexibility but lack the durability of the SimPure. On the premium end, reverse osmosis systems like the APEC Water System deliver a more advanced filtration process, including TDS reduction, but they’re bulkier and require more intrusive installation.

I found the SimPure struck the right balance for my needs. It offers robust construction, a simple setup, and excellent filtration for everyday municipal water without stripping essential minerals. Compared to the Brita under-sink filter I used last year, the water flow and taste are leaps ahead. Still, for those requiring advanced filtration or TDS reduction, there are plenty of alternatives that may better suit their needs.

**Cost Efficiency**

From a financial angle, this water filtration system makes a lot of sense. You get up to a full year of use or 20,000 gallons from a single filter. Over time, it’s more economical than constantly buying bottled water or using smaller countertop filters with limited capacity. While it sits somewhere in the mid-range in terms of upfront cost compared to its peers, I feel like it offers great value, especially when considering its durability and performance.

1kgvgj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/1kgvgj4/delulu_but_determined_to_find_cool_friends/,Delulu but determined to find cool friends! 🍀🍁🪻,"Drama brought me here, now I'm trying to manifest some cool online friends!

So I was watching this heartwarming drama where the female lead had these deep online friendships, and it hit me— why not me too? Inspired by that, here I am, manifesting my own little corner of wholesome internet friendships.

I’m a bit of a delulu dreamer 🎀💅 — because honestly, daydreaming is half my personality at this point and probably the only way I’m coping with life as a student. I’ve met a few sweet souls here before, but I’m hoping to expand my circle a bit more.

Here’s a little peek into my world:

I paint and doodle when the world gets too loud—it’s my quiet space.
 I adore old Asian dramas/movies (one that made me cry way too much: Under the Hawthorn Tree).
 I’m currently studying as an undergrad, so you’ll often find me curled up with my laptop, coffee, and a challenging Sudoku puzzle (yes, I’m stuck on expert level on [sudoku.com](http://sudoku.com) and it’s a humbling experience).
I'm also a massive fan of webtoons, manhwa, and manhua (Solo Leveling, Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, and anything with badass characters or emotional chaos).

If you’re a student too—yay! Let’s rant about assignments together. But even if you're not, that’s totally fine. I'm mostly looking to talk to folks in their early twenties, just to have that similar-ish life stage vibe. Still, if you're kind, curious, or a fellow little weirdo, hit me up.

And hey—if you’ve read this far, you clearly have amazing attention span. Here’s  a chocolate! You earned it.🍫✨

Just enough to make life worth living and enjoy which is what I seek most. Some things about me:

	◦	6 feet tall, hazel eyes, brown hair, shaved face, and I wear shorts almost all year round, unless I am at work.

	◦	Enjoying the outdoors is very much a priority for me
	◦	I love collecting movies and watching them on my fancy, expensive TV (not to brag or anything)
	◦	Riding my bicycle and traveling are enjoyable to me plus I got bike rack for my car for two bicycles
	◦	Cooking is something I want to get better at and all ready have a good assortment of tools for the job in my kitchen and would like to acquire more
	◦	I enjoy tea and coffee more than most things

1kgve85,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1kgve85/sentinel_part_93/,Sentinel: Part 93.,"May 7, 2025. Wednesday. 12:00 AM. 62°F.

The midnight air settled cool and still over Ashandar Village, the moonlight casting silvery highlights across the sloping terrain. I, sentinel, stood idle near the barn, my systems powered and fully synchronized, my thermal sensors calibrated to track fluctuations in the wind that blew gently at 3 mph from the east. Brick remained stationed behind me at a complete stop, his armored surface cleaned from the remnants of the past day’s drills. Vanguard was positioned to my right at 0 mph, his turret slowly rotating as part of his automated night-watch protocol. Connor stood directly in front of me, arms folded, watching the star-filled sky, dressed in a clean black field jacket and olive cargo pants. The side of his face still had a faint streak of grease from adjusting my primary cable harness earlier in the evening. He took a slow sip from a steaming black coffee cup he held in his right hand.

Above us, Ghostrider maintained his orbit at exactly 400 feet, flying at 118 mph with his engines in low-detection mode. Reaper soared nearby at 200 feet and 101 mph, while Striker moved in a holding pattern at 180 feet, cruising steadily at 90 mph. Their infrared sensors remained active, sweeping the terrain below in synchronized passes. Titan rolled at 15 mph down the southern trail, flanked closely by Bulldog who held at a steady 30 mph, both patrolling the tree line. Artemis tracked behind them at exactly 28 mph, his launcher system locked in secure transport position. Khanzada trotted calmly beside them at 5 mph, the metal tags on his reinforced collar gently clinking as he moved. The entire team maintained formation and awareness, as always—tight, unified, ready.

At exactly 12:13 AM, an alert registered on my radar array. It came from the upper stratosphere. Altitude: 35,000 feet. Speed: Mach 0.6, gradually descending.

“Unknown aerial contact,” I announced over team comms. “Designation: Unidentified American military UAV. Profile match in progress.”

Connor adjusted his earpiece. “Eyes up, boys.”

Within twelve seconds, my system completed the match. Boeing MQ-25 Stingray. Stealth aerial refueler. Heavy armor plating confirmed. Armament systems present: classified. Call sign: Skyreach. 

Khanzada snorted. “He’s one of us.”

Ghostrider’s voice echoed through the network. “MQ-25 profile checks out. He’s got the clearance.”

Reaper added, “He’s fast, efficient, and rarely seen. Welcome surprise.”

At exactly 12:17 AM, Skyreach pierced through a veil of low-altitude cloud cover. Altitude: 2,000 feet. Speed: 310 mph. Hull shimmered faintly with radar-dampening coating. Long delta wings swept backward. Twin engine nacelles flanked the rear fuselage. A reinforced dorsal intake gleamed under the moonlight. He gradually decelerated, initiating an elegant spiral descent.

“I see you down there,” a calm, focused voice announced over the comms. “Name’s Skyreach. Stealth support, aerial sustainment, and multi-role surveillance. Permission to land?”

Connor replied, “You’re clear for approach. Touch down just west of the barn. And welcome to the team.”

“Roger that,” Skyreach said smoothly.

At 12:24 AM, Skyreach descended to exactly 100 feet, speed reduced to 65 mph, VTOL landing thrusters activated. He came in from the west, aligned with precision, and hovered with unwavering control before touching down softly on reinforced composite landing gear 40 feet from where I stood. His landing velocity was exactly 2 mph, and his touchdown was nearly silent.

Skyreach’s hull bore matte graphite paint, with the American flag proudly painted near the intake port. His airframe was lined with discrete armor panels, and beneath his left wing pod, a modular hardpoint system sat locked with four unarmed reconnaissance canisters and two precision drone hatches. His voice remained calm and sharp.

“I’ve monitored this region for three weeks. Observed your formation. Assessed your cohesion. This team is unlike anything I’ve ever seen,” Skyreach said. “I’d like to be part of it.”

Connor took a few steps forward, boots crunching on gravel at 3 mph. “We don’t do things halfway. You stay with us, you stay close. We protect each other. No lone wolves.”

Skyreach’s rotors powered down gradually. “I fly above, but I’m never out of reach. I’ve got mid-air refueling capacity, extended-range targeting, and stealth-grade surveillance protocols. I don’t miss anything.”

Brick rolled forward at 5 mph. “You fly silent?”

“Like a whisper in the dark,” Skyreach replied.

Striker hovered lower, speaking clearly. “We’re all in or all out. Welcome aboard, Skyreach.”

At exactly 12:40 AM, Skyreach synced with our tactical network. His encrypted transmission lines passed my triple-layer verification, and he joined the communications grid without latency. His sensor uplinks provided a 180-degree live-feed radar overlay extending 220 nautical miles eastward. He was fast, quiet, incredibly advanced—and ours.

From 1:00 AM until 6:00 AM, Skyreach patrolled in staggered altitude patterns. He flew at 2,000 feet, cruising at 250 mph, then climbed briefly to 10,000 feet to recalibrate one of his encrypted signal relays. Every maneuver was surgical. Every motion purposeful.

By 6:20 AM, the first light of morning began to rise over Ashandar. The temperature climbed to 66°F as dew glistened on the farmland. Khanzada bellowed from beside Artemis, “Skyreach sees what others do not.”

Skyreach replied from above, “It’s what I was built for.”

At 8:47 AM, Connor conducted a manual inspection of Skyreach’s rear stabilizers, tapping each panel with a diagnostic wand. “Everything checks out. You’re not just in. You’re essential.”

“I’ll keep us safe from the skies,” Skyreach said.

At 10:25 AM, he performed a low-altitude flyover at 300 feet and 140 mph, saluting the team with a roll and a flare burst from his right pod. The sun shimmered off his matte finish as he banked gracefully to the west.

We watched him together—every member of the team, grounded or airborne, gathered in silent acknowledgment.

At exactly 12:00 PM, the sky was bright, the air was crisp at 81°F, and for the first time, our team had eyes in the wind.",1,1746618700.0,humansarespaceorcs,2,1.0,False

I’ve only recently gotten into perfume (thanks, TikTok), and I’m loving exploring so far, and I think I’ve finally figured out what I want. I used to wear Daisy Fresh just to smell clean, but found it too sweet and obviously “perfumey.”

Here’s what I’ve come up with -

1. Everyday/Home Scent – Clean, soapy, just-had-a-bath smell. Think comforting and fresh, but not sugary or floral. 
2. Spring/Summer Scent – Still clean, but with a fun citrus twist and a little green.
3. Fall/Winter Scent – I’m clueless here. I think I want something cozy, creamy, maybe with coconut, leather, or coffee notes but still clean, not cloying or heavy.

Stuff I’ve tried:

Maison Margiela Bubble Bath– Didn’t click for me.
Eros Energy– Liked it, but a bit too masc.
Michael Kors Pour Femme – Loved the super clean vibe, not too sweet. Just wasn’t quite right.
Rituals body creams/ sprays– Smell amazing but don’t last and perfumes ain’t it
Lush (Plum Rain, Once Upon a Time, Sun) – Great in-store, but way too fleeting or overpowering at home.
Acqua di Parma Sandalo – Gorgeous soapy warmth—would wear daily if it weren’t so £££
ADP Buongiorno – Smelled like a fresh lemon mojito dream, but out of budget. I got Colonia instead (second fave), though it doesn’t last long.
White Musk Body Shop perfume oil - I love this so much for myself, but doesn’t really project. Love love love it though. So so clean like dove soap. 

Bonus: One of my all-time favourite smells is tomato vines. If that exists in a perfume, I’m sold. The Aery Tomato vine candle gets huffed daily it’s stunning.

I don’t like rosy florals, overly feminine or masc scents, or anything that smells heavily of alcohol. Just want to smell fresh and interesting - and I love being told I smell good! The search continues but happy with what I’ve found in the past few weeks! 

Just sharing what I’ve tried so far but open to recs but especially for the cozy autumn scent❤️

1kgv9ro,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kgv9ro/uncover_if_the_breville_barista_pro_espresso/,Uncover if the Breville Barista Pro Espresso Machine is Worth It Review,"Testing coffee machines is a daily pleasure for someone deeply passionate about the perfect cup of espresso. The Breville RM-BES878BSS1BUS1 Barista Pro Espresso Machine is a device I’ve worked with extensively, and I’m eager to share my experiences. Using this remanufactured model has taught me a lot about its merits as well as its limitations, making it a fascinating piece of equipment for both novice and seasoned coffee enthusiasts.

**Stunning Design and Build Quality**

Aesthetically, this espresso machine is a winner. Its brushed stainless steel finish gives it a sleek, modern look that fits perfectly in a high-end kitchen or even a cozy coffee nook. The compact dimensions (13”D x 16”W x 14”H) mean it doesn’t dominate your countertop—a big plus for those with smaller spaces. The components, from the integrated grinder to the steam wand and the removable tank, feel robust and well-put-together. Handling it, you can sense the effort put into manufacturing (even for a certified remanufactured unit).

The buttons are intuitively laid out, and the LCD interface is wonderfully user-friendly. It displays grinding and extraction progress, making it easy to observe and fine-tune how your espresso is made.

Check the [Breville RM-BES878BSS1BUS1 price on Amazon now.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dglz5j3p/)

**Advantages**

- Produces third-wave specialty coffee with impressive consistency.  
- The ThermoJet heating system heats up in just three seconds.  
- Integrated precision conical burr grinder ensures rich, flavorful coffee.  
- Manual microfoam milk texturing enables latte art creation.  

**Real World Performance**

Here’s where this espresso machine truly shines. Using it every morning, I’ve enjoyed incredibly consistent results. The digital temperature control keeps the water temperature spot-on for optimal extraction. The low-pressure pre-infusion gently prepares the coffee grounds, ensuring a beautifully even taste in every cup.

I’ve also tested the built-in grinder extensively. With adjustable grind control, it caters to various coffee preferences. My double-shot pulls are routinely excellent, and single shots meet my expectations for both strength and flavor balance. As someone particular about espresso, this machine succeeds in bringing an elevated coffeehouse vibe into my home.

**Ease of Use**

Despite all its advanced features, I’d call this espresso maker easy to learn after a bit of practice. Initially, I had some trouble with dose consistency, mainly due to incorrect filter basket choices. Once I figured it out, making espresso became second nature. The user manual was helpful but could have been a bit more detailed for those who aren’t experienced with specialty coffee machines. My kids love watching me froth milk for their hot chocolates—it’s simple and effective, though it took a week of trial and error to get silky microfoam.

**Disadvantages**

- Remanufactured condition means occasional quality inconsistencies.  
- The grinder, while excellent, requires precise calibration to avoid frustration.  
- Some users report shipping issues with missing or damaged parts.  

**Durability and Maintenance**

After using the machine for nearly six months, durability seems solid overall. The removable tank and reusable filter make everyday maintenance a breeze. The cleaning kit included in the box has been invaluable for keeping the steam wand and grinder in perfect working order. However, I’ve read a few accounts from other users complaining about wear and tear—particularly on refurbished units.

**Competing Products**

Compared to machines like the De’Longhi La Specialista or Gaggia Classic Pro, the Barista Pro has a distinct edge with its built-in ThermoJet heating technology, which makes it faster. The Gaggia Classic provides manual brewing control but lacks the user-friendly enhancements of the Barista Pro. On the other hand, De’Longhi excels in delivering a more luxurious build; its grinder sometimes outpaces Breville’s consistency.

While it’s a tight race, Breville’s interface and compact size appeal more to users who prioritize convenience without sacrificing performance. If flexibility and precise control matter to you, this machine has strong advantages.

**Bang for the Buck**

When looking at similar products in the super-automatic espresso machine segment, the Breville Barista Pro poses an attractive proposition. Its price point for certified remanufactured units makes it even more compelling. The included six-month warranty is like an extra layer of reassurance. If price and functionality matter equally in your coffee journey, this espresso maker offers true value.

1kgv9cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Keto_Food/comments/1kgv9cu/need_some_guidance/,Need some guidance,"Hello everyone. Not sure if this is the right place to ask this......bit here we go.
I live in a small, remote area in the mountains that's surrounded by wilderness. The closest grocery store is about an hour away. On daily basis I'm in the woods felling, limbing and sectioning trees with and axe and very large folding saw (silky katanaboy 500). This has been my usual meals everyday

Breakfast:
A cup of coffee with 3/4 tsp of butter
1/4 cup of walnuts
1/4 pecans
1 boiled egg

Lunch:
1 packet of salmon
(1) 2oz. Container of avocado

Snack:
1 boiled egg

Dinner:
Keto friendly vegetables cooked in 1/2 tsp of coconut oil, 1 tbsp of avocado oil, 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil, and I top it off with 1 packet of tuna.

I know....well I'm pretty, sure I need to increase calories via fats and a moderate amount of protein. I say this because lately, after 90 min or so of working my energy seems to bottom out and I start struggling to continue. It's not that I'm tired or exhausted.... I just don't have it in me.
 Does anyone have any suggestions or maybe a different strategy in order to keep a calorie deficit and stay in ketosis while fueling my physical labor?

1kgv8dz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TypologyJunction/comments/1kgv8dz/what_type_of_pyenneagram_am_i/,What type of PY/Enneagram am I?,"**1. What is your current plan for the next 5 years of your life?** I don’t really have academic ambitions. My plan is to study, graduate, and hopefully get a job, even if it’s simple with a modest salary. What matters most to me is having some financial stability. That’s better than being homeless or relying on someone else. I’m pretty adaptable and can cut down on my needs to the point I forget I even had them.

That said, I’ve been planning to write a novel for years now. I want to do it properly, but I haven’t started yet because I still don’t feel ready. So for now, I gather information, reflect on my writing ideas, and imagine the scenes in my head. But I know that once I feel ready, I’ll write for hours, it happened before with a short story. My main struggle is perfectionism. If what I write doesn’t match what I picture in my mind, I get anxious. Still, I truly believe I can write something great. And while I am a bit sensitive to criticism, I welcome any feedback that will make my work better, as long as it’s actually helpful.

**2. What are your thoughts on language?** I tend to pick up on the meaning behind words pretty easily, which helps me sense people’s intentions when they talk. I try to be kind and easygoing in conversations. Language itself isn’t my strongest skill, but I want to get better at it. I see it as a way to understand people deeply and communicate with clarity.

**3. How do you find physical comfort?** I used to think I was neglectful when it came to physical things, like my room being messy or not brushing my hair. But over time, I noticed I do care about my surroundings and appearance more than I thought. I enjoy things like music, scents, coffee or tea depending on my mood and the weather. I work out sometimes, and I used to be good at karate as a kid. I don’t like sleeping less than 7 hours, it doesn’t even feel like I slept if I do. I enjoy shopping for clothes but not excessively since it’s expensive. Still, I sometimes waste money on junk food or small pleasures and regret it later.

**4. Are your feelings obvious to you?** Growing up, I learned to suppress my feelings as a defense mechanism. I thought expressing emotions was a sign of weakness. I buried my emotions completely until around 18. I was focused on studying and working to secure stability, but inside I was burning out. I tried to be perfect to avoid criticism. I saw emotions as mistakes.

That mindset broke me, and I realized that ignoring my emotions was taking me down a dark path. I’ve started learning to be more emotionally aware, not to show it outwardly, but to understand what I’m feeling and why. Now, I’m learning to accept my emotions rather than fight or deny them.

**5. How do you feel about authority?** If it’s just work-related authority, I don’t care, I’ll do what I need to and move on. But if someone tries to control my personal decisions or future plans, I push back. Sometimes openly, other times by blending in while secretly working on my own thing or finding a way out.

Should others listen to authority? That’s up to them. As long as it doesn’t lead to unethical or harmful decisions. When it does, I start feeling disgusted by the whole situation.

**6. Do you believe you have strong reasoning skills?** I’m good at analyzing things, connecting information, and spotting inconsistencies. I look at other people’s opinions too before forming my own. It’s like building a tower, it has to be stable. I constantly revise what I believe, especially when writing something like my novel. One small change can knock everything down, and I hate that.

Do I like arguing? Depends on my mood. If the other person is open-minded, the discussion might help me grow. But if they’re the stubborn type, I’d rather talk to a wall, at least it won’t give me a headache.

**7. Describe something you find aesthetically pleasing.** I like observing natural surroundings like the sea or weather. It helps clear my head, especially when I’m alone. My room has a color theme I really enjoy, dark and muted tones like brown, gray, black, or dark purple. When I buy things, I try to make sure they match the vibe of my room.

**8. Do you trust your internal reactions towards people?** Yes, I observe people closely and analyze their behavior. I don’t rush to judge, but I test scenarios in my mind, like, “what would this person do if that happened?” When I was younger, I used to actually create those situations in real life to test them. It was naive and sometimes hurtful, but I didn’t know any better.

Even now, I interact with people wearing a “friendly” mask. Everything I say is calculated, not because I’m fake, but because I don’t want to hurt others or get hurt. I keep some distance emotionally. When someone gets too close, I get scared. I don’t really care about emotional bonds or even friendship, I’m comfortable in my isolation. And that makes me feel guilty sometimes, so I try to be kinder to others.

**9. How does it feel to think of the future?** My priority is stability. So when I feel unstable in the present, I get pessimistic about the future. I try to focus on the present and make decisions that could improve things long-term. For me, living a quiet life, away from noise and pressure, is my idea of success.

That doesn’t mean I’ve given up on my dreams, like writing my novel. But I don’t chase after status or climb some metaphorical ladder. That would exhaust me. I try to stay focused on what really matters to me.

**10. How do you organize information?** Building systems and structure is essential to me, it keeps me from feeling overwhelmed. It’s mostly mental, not written down. I like reviewing things multiple times to make sure everything fits. One of the best feelings is learning something new and realizing it fits perfectly into what I already know, like finding the missing puzzle piece.

**11. Do you have a daily routine?** I don’t follow a rigid routine, but I do have priorities. Things like studying, reading, or working out (if I’m back into it) come first. Then there are side activities like hobbies or self-improvement. If I do it all, that’s an ideal day. If I just cover the basics, I still feel like I’m making progress. But if I spend the day on meaningless stuff, I feel guilty and try to make up for it later.

I don’t like giving up my time for others, but sometimes I have to. So when that happens, I try to handle it quickly and then refocus on my priorities. I adjust and move on.

**12. Describe one of the best moods you have ever been in. And the worst.** The worst period I went through was between the end of high school and the start of university. I was under intense internal pressure, torn between others’ expectations and suppressing my own emotions. I pushed myself too hard to seem perfect and ignored any sign of vulnerability.

As for the best mood I’ve been in, I realized it doesn’t come from achievement or success, but from the simplest moments, reading a book in dim lighting, drinking coffee in a quiet cold room, silent reflection, or going on a calm walk with family. These moments bring me a kind of peace that feels priceless. Sometimes I’d think to myself, if my whole life was just this moment, I’d be perfectly content.

**13. What is your greatest strength?** I’d say my strengths are gathering and refining information, adapting to different people and environments, and a constant curiosity to try new things and hobbies — even if I don’t stick with them. Once I decide to do something, I want to do it as well as possible. I hate doing a half-baked job.

This drive for quality makes me analyze things deeply, connect ideas, and ensure everything is grounded in a solid framework. I don’t force myself into conversations, but when I do speak, it comes from real understanding and thought — not just random opinions.

**14. In what ways are you resilient? Are you an inspiration to others?** I’ve gone through harsh mental pressure and suffocating external expectations, but I never truly gave up. I processed things silently, tried to absorb the pain instead of sinking into it. I do break down sometimes, but I don’t let it stop me for good. I recover slowly, but I always move forward.

I don’t think of myself as an inspiration directly. But when someone asks me for advice or support, I offer what I’ve learned honestly, no sugarcoating. I think my perspective helps others see things they may have overlooked.

**15. What is your biggest fear?** I’m afraid of being incompetent or losing my independence and ending up relying on others. That fear made me obsessed with perfection, trying to prove to myself I can handle life on my own. I used to think that losing just two marks on a test would ruin my whole future. That mindset came from my family, but I made it worse myself.

I also fear disappointing people, which sometimes leads me to agree to things I don’t actually want. Lately I’ve been learning how to say “no” clearly and draw boundaries, even if it disappoints someone. I don’t want to be a bad person, so I try to be kind and thoughtful. But I have strong self-criticism and that makes it hard to move forward.

**16. What feels like a waste of time to engage in?** Anything outside of my interests feels like a waste of time, shallow conversations, unnecessary social events, weddings, small talk. Even long talks with my father can feel draining sometimes, because his focus is always on material things I don’t really care about.

He asks what I want in life, but I don’t even know myself. I’ve tried setting big goals before and failed. Now, I don’t want to exhaust myself with fake optimism. I’d rather say I did my best and accept whatever comes.

Writing my novel is a perfect example of this. If I fail, I’ll be okay, what matters is that I gave it everything I had.

**17. Are you a leader? What qualifies or disqualifies you as one?** I rarely take the lead, and I prefer to support or collaborate. I might step up if no one else will or if I’m clearly the most capable. But I don’t chase leadership and it doesn’t come naturally to me. Leading drains me, especially if I don’t care about the task.

I’m observant and often figure out what needs to be done and guide things quietly, whether through words or subtle direction. In group settings, I’m more comfortable when there’s a mutual exchange — I offer what I’m good at and ask for help with what I’m not. I sometimes push boundaries gently to help others, but I don’t impose myself. I prefer gradual influence that doesn’t feel intrusive.

I choose to collaborate with people who are useful or skilled. But when someone’s good at everything, I honestly don’t know how to interact, I don’t know what I can give them.

**18. When do you feel the most collaborative with others?** I’m most collaborative when there’s a clear give-and-take, where both sides know they have something to offer. I don’t like being a follower, but I also don’t want to be the one controlling everything. I prefer working with people who value effort and respect boundaries.

That said, I usually lean toward working alone. I like clear environments without noise or distractions. But I know being closed off can hurt me long-term, so I cooperate when I need to. If I’m expected to work with others, I’ll do it. If I’m expected to be more social, I’ll manage. But I’ll always feel more at peace when I’m allowed to be in my own space.

**19. Do you overcome doubt and hesitance? Explain why or why not.** Most of my decisions go through a phase of hesitation. I overanalyze and think about all the consequences. Sometimes fear of failure holds me back. But what helps me push through is believing that not deciding is worse than making an imperfect choice.

I see doubt and hesitation as something I have to sit with, not avoid. In the end, I usually act, even if it takes time. Sometimes I follow inspiration or intuition when logic hits a wall.

I’m still learning to be more decisive, but I’ve made a lot of progress in accepting hesitation as part of who I am, not a flaw.

**20. Do you yield to others? If so, in what situations do you do this? How do you feel about it?** Yeah, I tend to give in a lot because I hate conflict. That really frustrates me. Sometimes I let things go just to avoid arguments. But if someone keeps pushing or crosses a line, I might eventually snap and let everything out at once.

That’s why I started avoiding direct emotional honesty. Instead, I express frustration through sarcasm or light criticism, it gets the point across without a full confrontation. I’ve also started setting clearer boundaries and being more stubborn when someone tries to overstep.

Still, if I can escape conflict without it repeating again, I’ll take that path, even if it hurts my pride. Most of the time, I let go of arguments because I know they’ll go nowhere and I have better things to focus on.",1,1746618154.0,TypologyJunction,0,1.0,False

Review inside!,"The Ponhog PHTR24008-BK01 Underseat Carry-On Luggage had me curious from the beginning. With its promise of compactness, airline-approved size, and expandable features, it seemed like a dream for any frequent traveler. Over a few weeks and several trips, I truly put this suitcase to the test. Here are my thoughts on it, after lugging it around airports, hotels, and even a train or two.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Starting with its appearance, this little carry-on doesn’t scream luxury, but it’s definitely sleek and practical. Made with 1680D polyester, it has a slightly rugged feel, and more importantly, it’s water-resistant. One rainy day involved my coworker and I dashing to catch a taxi in a drizzle, and everything inside stayed mercifully dry. The suitcase measures 17.2 x 12.6 x 7.48 inches, fitting neatly under most airline seats – no awkward wrestling to shove it into place. Weighing just slightly over five pounds, it doesn’t strain your arm or other muscles when lifting it overhead. Yet, I can't help but wish the outer shell was slightly sturdier. The soft-sided design may not offer as much impact protection as hard-sided luggage—something to consider if you’re prone to accidents like dropping bags from overhead compartments.

**Interior Layout and Packing Ease**  
This suitcase boasts a surprisingly spacious interior for its size. I managed to pack for a four-day work trip, thanks to its 30-liter capacity that expands to 35 liters. There are nine pockets and compartments, which made organization a breeze. I loved the dedicated 15.6-inch laptop compartment that safely stored all my electronics—an absolute blessing for someone who carries a tech arsenal. On one trip, I designated half the suitcase for work files and the other half for packing cubes, and it was shockingly efficient. However, despite all this, the expandable zipper can only take you so far. Overstuffing it prevented zippers from gliding smooth and made me nervous about durability.

[Check Ponhog PHTR24008-BK01 price on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b0d3tpk7c4/)

**Wheel and Handle Performance**  
Here’s where the suitcase made me smile. The four spinner wheels rotate 360 degrees, ensuring easy maneuverability through crowded terminals and uneven parking lots. I was suspicious of its performance on less forgiving terrains like cobblestones, but truthfully, it did just fine. The telescopic aluminum handle extends smoothly and comfortably; there were no infuriating jams. Also, the PU leather grip on the top handle felt soft on the hands—a small but thoughtful detail. However, the wheels’ placement does make stability an issue. At times, especially if you’re in a rush and pull it too quickly, the bag has a slight tendency to topple forward if packed unevenly. This left me awkwardly rearranging items at least twice during trips.

**Merits**  
- Airline-approved size and lightweight design  
- Durable polyester exterior with water resistance  
- Multiple pockets for efficient organization  
- Smooth spinner wheels and a well-designed telescopic handle

**Flaws**  
- Suitcase becomes unstable when unevenly packed  
- Expandable zips can struggle when fully stuffed  
- Soft-sided outer shell offers limited impact protection

**Real-Life Use Cases**  
Traveling with this carry-on is mostly hassle-free. My sister borrowed it for a weekend getaway and raved about how smoothly it fit beneath her Spirit Airlines seat, avoiding the dreaded checked-bag fee. However, on one particularly chaotic business trip, a colleague spilled coffee on it mid-airport dash. Luckily, the water-resistant fabric proved its worth, and the suitcase wiped clean with no telltale stains. Still, airport chaos highlighted one critique: removable wheels. Yes, they’re a nifty feature and reduce storage space when not in use, but having to snap them on and off gets tedious. Also, removable wheels could be misplaced, turning functionality into frustration.

**Product Rivals**  
Comparing the Ponhog to other carry-ons, the Samsonite Winfield 2 comes to mind, with its hard-sided polycarbonate shell and impressive durability. Samsonite’s build remains undeniably sturdier, but it weighs more and doesn’t expand like the Ponhog. On the cheaper end, the Amazon Basics Underseat Luggage offers similar storage organization but skimps on quality – my friend’s broke after three uses. Looking at the broader market, it’s clear the Ponhog strikes a sweet spot between price, functionality, and aesthetics. Its true edge lies in being compact yet versatile for multipurpose trips.

**Bang for the Buck**  
As someone who buys luggage hoping it lasts years, I’d say this product is worth its cost, but primarily for lightweight to moderate travel. It may not satisfy heavy packers or those expecting it to double as checked luggage. That said, you’re paying for an airline-approved design with thoughtful details like removable wheels, a laptop compartment, and comfortable handling. Sure, a sturdier build would make me feel more reassured, but for quick trips, it performs admirably.

I used to do it all at 205 and stir it once after I filled it and then wait four minutes then press. usually this was alright. but not always.

anyone have any ideas what would make it weak and acidy? I tried adding another minute to the time. all that did was add bitter to the weak acidy flavor.

1kgv12t,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingSpacesHub/comments/1kgv12t/is_hahafelt_car_seat_towel_cover_the_best_nonslip/,Is Hahafelt Car Seat Towel Cover the Best Non-Slip Option? Review Inside!,"Hahafelt QUN-Hahafelt-29 was recently put to the test in my vehicle, and I’ve got to admit, I didn’t expect to be so pleasantly surprised by a car seat towel cover. A simple accessory like this has made a big difference in my daily commute, post-gym trips, and outdoor adventures. While it’s not without its minor shortcomings, the overall performance and functionality have made it a staple in my car.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of these green towel seat covers immediately caught my eye. With a subtle mountain pattern on one side, it brings a refreshing pop of color to an otherwise utilitarian car seat accessory. Measuring approximately 63 x 32 inches, it’s a universal fit that easily accommodates most automobile seats. The fact that it includes an integrated headrest pocket ensures it stays securely in place, while the non-slip fabric is a game-changer, preventing annoying sliding as I get in and out of the car. The covers are crafted from a polyester and nylon blend, which balances durability and comfort. They’re soft yet sturdy enough to stand up to daily wear and tear. That fabric blend also makes the covers feel lightweight, so rolling them for storage is effortless.

**Ease of Installation and Cleaning**  
No one wants a product that’s a hassle to deal with day-to-day. These towel covers shine in that department, proving to be very user-friendly. Installation is as simple as slipping the headrest pocket over the car seat – even my teenager managed to do it without my guidance. Cleaning these is a breeze as they’re machine washable. After sweaty workout sessions or muddy outdoor escapades with my dog, I toss them in the washer, and they come out looking almost brand new. The included storage bag is a nice touch, keeping the towel tidy when not in use.

**Performance**  
This is where the product truly shines. The towel seat covers are incredibly absorbent, soaking up sweat without leaving that dreaded damp feeling behind. On those days when I’ve hit the gym harder than expected, I’m glad I can rely on these covers to protect my car seats from sweat stains. Add to that their quick-drying nature, making them ready for action the next day, and you’ve got yourself a winner. The material also holds up well against scuff marks from shoes, pet footprints, and even the occasional spilled coffee.

**Versatility**  
While originally intended for my car seats, I’ve found myself using these covers in multiple scenarios. They doubled as a bicycle seat cover on a recent cycling trip and were a great post-swim towel during a day at the lake. I even threw them over some folding chairs at a picnic when the seats were a bit damp. This multi-functionality has added a lot of value, and it’s clear the manufacturer put thought into making them capable of more than just one job.

**Highlights**  
- Non-slip design keeps the cover securely in place.  
- Absorbent material protects seats from sweat and stains.  
- Quick-drying fabric is ideal for frequent use.  
- Machine washable for minimal maintenance.  

**Drawbacks**  
Despite all its good stuff, there were a couple of things that didn’t work perfectly for me.  
- The fabric, while durable, doesn’t feel as plush or high-end as some may hope.  
- Some users have noted slight sizing issues on larger SUV or truck seats.  
- The included storage bag, while handy, could have been a bit more spacious.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing the Hahafelt seat towel covers with other popular options in the market, such as some microfiber gym seat covers or neoprene alternatives, revealed a few differences. For instance, some neoprene covers I’ve tried before offered a more premium texture but lacked the quick-drying feature. On the other hand, microfiber options tend to slip more than this non-slip design. The Hahafelt covers strike a good balance – affordable, easy to maintain, and versatile – standing out for their value-priced functionality and durability.

**Affordable Quality**  
Looking at the price-performance ratio, these covers stand their ground admirably. There are flashier, more premium options out there for sure, but they often come with a hefty price tag. The versatility and ease of use Hahafelt’s product offers make it worth the purchase, especially for folks who need something functional rather than extravagant. For car owners balancing a tight budget with the need for reliable accessories, this is a solid pick.

1kguyzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kguyzb/explore_if_the_chemex_cm1c_pourover_coffeemaker/,Explore if the Chemex CM-1C Pour-Over Coffeemaker is Worth It Review,"Nothing gets more satisfying than waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Over the past month, I’ve been switching up my coffee-making routine with the Chemex CM-1C Pour-Over Glass Coffeemaker from the Classic Series. Its three-cup design intrigued me, not just for its minimalist look but also for the promise of delivering exceptional coffee. As someone who enjoys taking their time making coffee each morning, I wasn’t disappointed. But, as always, no product is flawless, and this elegant coffee maker has its quirks.

**Elegant Design and Craftsmanship**  
I was immediately drawn to the design of this glass coffeemaker. It’s made of high-quality borosilicate glass, which resists absorbing odors or stains— an absolute must for keeping coffee flavors pure. The clear glass is sleek and modern, making it a display-worthy item for the countertop. Moreover, at just 3 inches wide and 8.25 inches tall, it’s compact and doesn’t consume much space, which is perfect for smaller kitchens like mine. However, its lightweight build (14.4 ounces) left me feeling slightly cautious when handling it, as it doesn’t feel as robust as some competitors.  

[Check Chemex CM-1C price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b004beqfvy/)

**Brewing Simplicity At Its Best**  
Brewing coffee with this appliance couldn’t be simpler. Following the classic pour-over method, you only need freshly ground coffee, hot water, and Chemex Half Circle Filters (note: these aren’t included, which caught me off guard). The results, however, are worth every added purchase. I noticed how the patented design of the coffeemaker manages to create balanced flavors and a crystal-clear brew— no bitterness, just rich and smooth coffee. It’s perfect for anyone who genuinely enjoys the craft of making coffee one step at a time.  

**Flavor and Capacity Considerations**  
Here’s where things get trickier. This three-cup size uses Chemex's measurement of 5 ounces per cup, which isn’t much for those who prefer large mugs of coffee. Personally, I found myself needing to brew another batch on days when I needed a caffeine boost. That said, I can’t deny how incredible the coffee tasted— a clean, bright cup that truly reflects its pour-over process.

**Highlights**  
- Stunning, timeless design that elevates any kitchen countertop.  
- Borosilicate glass ensures no lingering odors or chemical residues.  
- Produces clean, smooth coffee with complex flavors.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Filters are a must-purchase accessory but not provided.  
- Small serving size might not work for heavy coffee drinkers.  
- Lightweight material requires cautious handling to avoid breakage.  

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
Another reason this coffeemaker has become part of my daily ritual is its ease of cleaning. Being dishwasher-safe is a huge plus for days I don’t feel like handwashing. Just remove the used filter, rinse, and toss it into the top rack. However, its narrow neck does mean if you’re hand-washing, getting every corner fully cleaned can take more effort.  

**Competing Options**  
Comparing this coffeemaker with other pour-over options like the Hario V60 or Kalita Wave, the Chemex stands out for its all-in-one construction and aesthetic design. Hario’s ceramic and stainless steel options might offer durability, while Kalita’s flat-bottom filters create a different brewing experience. However, neither of these brands provides the kind of seamless, odor-free brewing experience that Chemex’s borosilicate glass offers. Still, if budget and durability are your priorities, it’s worth exploring these alternatives.  

**True Value**  
For a niche coffeemaker, I find its pricing justifiable considering its craftsmanship and the experience it delivers to every coffee lover. While the cost of additional items like filters can add up over time, the quality of coffee output makes it a worthy indulgence. However, if you’re someone who's just fine with a drip coffee machine, this might not feel like the best investment.

Jack squared his shoulders and declared, ""I'm a star hockey player now. I've got endorsement deals. Magazine covers. I need someone who understands this lifestyle.""  
I couldn't believe what I was hearing. ""This lifestyle? You mean the one where I've supported you through three team changes and two injuries? ""  
He kept pacing. ""The thing is, I've met someone who gets it. She understands the demands, the spotlight.""  
""Wow. So there's already a replacement. Who is she? One of those influencer models commenting on your photos?""  
Jack's silence confirmed my suspicions.  
""How long?"" I asked.  
He sighed dramatically. ""A few months. It just happened.""  
I stood, unable to stay in the bed we'd shared for eight years.  
""Jack? Your career high is 28 goals in a season. My grandfather made 28 million dollars last week."" I smiled sweetly. ""You've just made the biggest mistake of your life.""
————————
Emma Carter's butt had gone numb from sitting in the same cushioned seat for three hours. Not even the luxury boxes at Boston Arena had chairs comfortable enough for the marathon that was playoff hockey. The crowd roared as the final buzzer sounded—Boston Blades 3, Montreal 2.

She stood and stretched, watching as her husband Jack scored the winning goal in overtime. The fans stomped and chanted his name, their hero on ice. Emma smiled, genuinely happy for him despite everything else.

""Mrs. Reynolds? Would you like me to call your car?"" the suite attendant asked, already gathering her empty water bottles.

""Not yet, thanks. I'm heading down to congratulate the team."" Emma grabbed her purse, a simple leather tote that clashed hilariously with the designer outfits of the other hockey wives.

The attendant's smile tightened. ""Oh, I believe there's a private team celebration tonight. Players only.""

Emma's phone buzzed with a text from Jack: Don't wait up. Team party at Murphy's.

She read between the lines. Don't show up. Don't embarrass me. Again.

""Right. Of course."" Emma forced a smile. ""I'll take that car now.""

Three hours and two unanswered calls later, Emma sat cross-legged on their king-sized bed, laptop open to a spreadsheet that tracked the household budget. Jack made millions, but old habits die hard. Her grandfather had taught her to watch every penny, even when you had billions of them.

The front door slammed downstairs. Emma closed her laptop and took a deep breath.

""Em? You still up?"" Jack's voice echoed through their too-big house, slightly slurred.

""In the bedroom,"" she called back, slipping on her glasses like armor.

Jack appeared in the doorway, still in his game-day suit, tie hanging loose around his neck. At thirty-two, he was in his hockey prime—six-foot-two, shoulders like a coat hanger, jawline that could cut glass. He'd been gorgeous when they met in college. Now he was sculpted.

""Helluva game, huh?"" He grinned, running a hand through his dark hair. ""Did you see that last goal?""

""It was amazing."" Emma smiled genuinely. ""That spin move was insane.""

""Coach said it's going on the season highlight reel."" Jack loosened his tie further but didn't move to take it off. He just stood there, swaying slightly.

Emma's stomach knotted. Something was wrong.

""You okay?"" she asked.

""Yeah. No. I mean—"" Jack reached into his inside jacket pocket and pulled out an envelope. ""I need to talk to you about something.""

""What's that?"" Emma nodded toward the envelope, though she already knew. The same dread she'd been feeling for months crystallized into something solid and cold.

Jack tossed the envelope onto the bed. It slid across the comforter and bumped against her knee.

""Divorce papers,"" he said, his voice oddly flat. ""My lawyer drew them up last week.""

Emma stared at the envelope. Her name was typed on the front in cold, official letters. She should cry, she thought distantly. She should be shocked. Instead, she felt like she'd been watching this train approach for miles.

""Were you going to discuss this with me first, or just throw legal documents at my face?"" The words came out calmer than she felt.

Jack had the decency to look uncomfortable for about half a second.

""Look, we both know this isn't working."" He gestured between them. ""You're... you, and I'm...""

""You're what, Jack?""

""I'm Jack Reynolds now."" He squared his shoulders. ""I've got endorsement deals. Magazine covers. I need someone who understands this lifestyle.""

Emma laughed, she couldn't help it. ""This lifestyle? You mean the one where I've supported you through three team changes and two injuries? Where I've moved cities four times in six years? That lifestyle?""

""See, this is what I mean."" Jack pointed at her accusingly. ""You're always keeping score.""

""I'm a numbers person. Sue me."" Emma picked up the envelope but didn't open it.

""The thing is,"" Jack continued, pacing now, ""I've met someone who gets it. She understands the demands, the spotlight.""

Emma's laugh turned hollow. ""Wow. So there's already a replacement. Who is she? Let me guess—one of those influencers models who's been commenting on your photos?""

Jack's silence was answer enough.

""How long?"" Emma asked.

""Does it matter?""

""It matters to me.""

Jack sighed dramatically. ""A few months. It just happened.""

Emma stood, suddenly unable to have this conversation in the bed they'd shared for eight years. ""Things don't 'just happen,' Jack. You make choices.""

""Fine. I chose someone who makes more sense for me now."" He threw his hands up. ""I'm not the same guy who married you in college. I need...""

""More?"" Emma supplied.

""Different."" Jack softened his tone, as if that made it better. ""You're smart, Em. Too smart for this world, honestly. But you don't fit anymore. You hide at games. You wear Target when everyone else wears Prada.""

""I like Target,"" Emma said, knowing how ridiculous this argument was becoming.

""The settlement's fair,"" Jack continued, nodding at the envelope. ""The house, a million cash, alimony for two years while you 'find yourself' or whatever.""

Emma clutched the envelope tighter, crumpling it slightly. She thought about all the things Jack didn't know—about her family, her grandfather, the trust fund she'd never touched, the shares she owned in companies whose names would make his head spin.

Her phone rang, cutting through the tense silence. Her grandfather's photo lit up the screen.

Jack rolled his eyes.

Emma snatched the phone. ""I should take this.""

""Of course you should."" Jack grabbed a duffel bag from the closet—already packed, she noticed. ""I'll be at the Ritz until I find a place. My lawyer's number is in there. Don't make this messy, Em.""

As Jack headed for the door, Emma called after him: ""Jack?""

He turned, hand on the doorframe.

""Your career high record is twenty-eight goals in a season. My grandfather made twenty-eight million dollars last week."" She smiled sweetly. ""Just keeping score.""

Jack's face contorted in confusion as she answered the phone.

""Hi, Grandpa,"" Emma said, watching her soon-to-be-ex-husband walk out. ""Yes, I saw the game. Listen, I think I'm ready to take you up on that job offer after all.""

The job Jack thought was just some entry-level position at Mitchell Industries—owned by her grandfather, Franklin Mitchell, billionaire and majority owner of the Boston Blades hockey franchise.

As the front door slammed shut, Emma finally opened the envelope. Beneath the legal jargon was one simple truth: Jack Reynolds had just made the biggest mistake of his career.

Emma stepped out of the taxi in front of Mitchell Tower, a gleaming seventy-story monument to her grandfather's business success. Sunglasses firmly in place, she'd swapped yesterday's jeans for a simple navy dress. Her divorce-papers-to-the-face makeover.

The security guard nodded as she entered. ""Morning, Ms. Carter.""

She smiled at the use of her mother's maiden name—the one she'd been using professionally for the past year. As far as anyone knew, Emma Carter was just another employee at Mitchell Industries, not Emma Mitchell Reynolds, granddaughter of Franklin Mitchell and soon-to-be-ex-wife of hockey star Jack Reynolds.

The executive elevator whisked her to the top floor. No scan, no keycard needed—it recognized her face. Money couldn't buy happiness, but it could buy really cool tech.

Franklin Mitchell's assistant—a perpetually frazzled man named Walter who'd been with him for thirty years—jumped up when she arrived.

""He's waiting for you, Ms. Carter. Can I get you coffee?""

""I'm fine, Walter. Thanks.""

Emma paused outside her grandfather's office, collecting herself. Don't cry. Don't break. Taking a deep breath, she pushed open the heavy oak door.

Franklin Mitchell sat behind a desk the size of a small boat. At seventy-eight, he still came to the office daily, even though doctors had been telling him to slow down for a decade. His white hair was immaculately combed, his bow tie perfectly centered. The only concession to age was the oxygen cannula in his nose, connected to a discreet tank beside his chair.

""There's my girl."" He beamed, pushing himself up with surprising strength.

Emma crossed the room and hugged him, careful not to squeeze too hard. He smelled like peppermint and old books.

""Sit, sit."" He gestured to the chair opposite his desk. ""You look like a mess, Emmy.""

Emma laughed despite herself. ""Good morning to you too, Grandpa.""

""I'm old. I get to skip pleasantries."" He studied her over his glasses. ""So he finally did it?""

""Last night."" Emma sank into the chair. ""How did you know?""

""Because I know everything."" Franklin tapped his temple. ""And because his agent called our PR department asking how to handle press for a friendly divorce.""

Emma's eyebrows shot up. ""Already? The papers aren't even signed.""

""Jack moves fast. On and off the ice."" Franklin's face darkened. ""Ungrateful little pissant.""

""Grandpa!""

""What? I'm not wrong."" He shuffled papers on his desk. ""I've never liked him.""

""You came to our wedding.""

""I gave a speech!""

""You told him if he hurt me, you'd make sure his body was never found.""

Franklin shrugged. ""I stand by that.""

Emma rubbed her temples. ""Please tell me you're not actually planning a murder.""

""Of course not."" Franklin waved dismissively. ""Too messy. Tax audit is much more effective.""

""Grandpa.""

""Fine, fine."" He smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. ""I called you here for something else, anyway.""

He opened a drawer and pulled out a manila folder, sliding it across the desk. Emma took it, noting the Mitchell Industries logo embossed on the front.

""What's this?""

""Your future.""

Emma opened the folder to find organizational charts, financial statements, and a stack of legal documents with sticky notes marked ""sign here.""

""You've been working in management for a year now,"" Franklin continued. ""Learning the business from the inside. It's time to stop hiding, Emmy.""

I'm 29. This is my first time on reddit because I feel such a strong urge to talk with anyone about what I'm going through. But also to see stories of other people and hope that things will get better. 

I kind of spiraled while writing and more and more came out. If someone responds, I hope you can respond without judgement. Thank you for reading this. I'm sorry if this is a cliché at times... I needed it off my chest. 

We we're in relationship and living together for 4 and half years and I must say I've never felt so lost as I feel today. Our relationship was very intense and I believe also very deep. He was my first boyfriend and the amount of loyalty I felt towards him is beyond me. Even now, I can't suddenly stop loving him, I basically spend 1/6 of my life with him. But it also became a very dark place and toxic place where we fought week in, week out. Rarely did we have a period of peace. I carry with me a lot of guilt about this, though I understand it takes two to tango.   
We met during covid times and lived in the same building, which was only us and another guy. After only a month we practically lived together and being in love it was the most intense and beautiful experience of my life. Everything was closed, no friends to see, just us, us and more us. Looking back, this was probably the worst that could have happened to us. He had no friends and no desire for friends, he liked his books, his guitar and his studies and for me it was fine, I didn't come in a relationship to change anyone. He was fine for me the way he was. I on the other hand liked spending time with friends, sleepovers, go out, go places with family or friends. It didn't fit in his vision for the relationship. And as the years went by, I gave up more and more of myself to be enough for him. But that's where the fights stepped in. The friction of not being able to be myself and of course insecurities and problems that I brought in from childhood too, started to cause massive fights.   
I fought with him every time I felt controlled, if I couldn't do something, if he'd show his disappointment for things I liked, if he couldn't be happy for me, when he didn't like my job, when his idea of intimacy didn't align with mine. I needed his validation so much, to hear that he loved me the way I was, that I was enough for him. But I couldn't get it.   
I feel guilty and ashamed at the meltdowns which ensued from my side. They crying, the screaming , the slamming doors, the self-harm sometimes because I felt so desperate and misunderstood. I started to feel so dependent on him, also because my social circle was pretty much gone. And he would always be there if I needed him, but the moment I needed him to talk about us, we would get no where and I couldn't get through to him.   
It became a cycle. I needed reassurance and security by talking about the problems we have and figure it out, by talking about our future and our expectations. He would tell me he didn't want to talk about it, until we went without fights for at least a long extended period of time. And in return I would try my best to not feel insecure, to not feel worried, to not start fights, but I never managed. When my chest got full again with anxiety, I needed to feel we were in this together and I couldn't get that from him and the fights would start again. 

The relationship became like a drug and I became like an addict and perhaps so did he. There was no stability, there were only highs and lows. And after a low, you need a high. Cuddling, intimacy, being together after having a deep low, could be intoxicating at times.   
Many times during our relationship I couldn't bare it anymore and I was on the point of leaving him. But in the end I always ended up coming back again, for exactly that reason of needing a hit of love. It was like a love addiction.   
But also because I kept holding on to the good moments. If both partners have no friends, you become the sole source of everything for the other person. I didn't even remember much anymore what it was like to go out for a drink with a friend. Or to talk about anything other than superficial chit chat. I only reserved these things for him and so did he.  
 All I would do is go out with him and we'd never go out in the evening unless for dinner. We were the coffee in calm places, bookstores and chitchat while watching netflix couple. Which was fine, though I craved so much more on the side as well. I wanted to travel with him, do fun stuff, go to the zoo, go climbing or canoeing, hiking. I didn't feel alive the way our life was like.   
I think that made hi feel pressured too, it's not that he disliked it, but he didn't share my passion for going out and about. He would occasionally do it for me, but always tell me he didn't want to this often. And sadly he wouldn't let me do this with other people either. So it was lonely.   
In between the fights, our relationship always felt very safe. And I'm scared that it wasn't because of me. He never cursed at me or put a finger on me, he was always calm and the first to want to stop fighting. But sometimes I think, that was  because he was avoidant of the topics. He wanted to sooth me and get back to 'normal' asap. Our problems kept slumbering, and he wouldn't have them on his mind, because it was me who struggled adapting to his needs. (He claims he felt the same at times, but I haven't gotten so far with my reflection to properly understand in what ways.)   
My biggest concern was that he also could never be clear in what he wanted of our future. I'm turning 30 in a few months, he only just turned 28. I thought we'd get married and have children, but he never sat me down to plan this or seriously consider this. Only promises of future conversations.   
It was tiring and draining. I felt like I gave myself, all of me, changed myself to hold on to a shared future and he couldn't meet me there either.   
He also couldn't every really share his feeling. He never admitted to feeling insecure or jealous, the emotions that makes us vulnerable. I've seen him cry, but explaining me why he felt sad was difficult. He cried for changes, like moving house. The stability that fell away. But he couldn't attach an emotion to it, or go in dept of what it was that he felt. I truly tried to understand him and it made me sad to see him sad, but I couldn't relate and couldn't properly comfort him with my words.  
  
Halfway in our relationship I suggested to go to therapy and we did. We had just been going to a new therapist for the last four months and that's where it went off the rails I think.  

I struggle a lot with how our breakup went. He didn't like the therapy anymore, because he felt she wasn't professional, she would say things he didn't like to hear, like that we were possibly in a very codependent relationship. When it was time in the sessions for him to open up, he opted out. She told me a few days ago, that it was very likely that the therapy got to close to him and he couldn't handle it. I even asked him to have a session with her alone, in case he felt like talking more freely or tell her what he wanted different, but he never did that. And I can't forgive him for that lack of effort to fight for us in this regard.   
Thinking about it now though... I think he was already giving up on us.   
This was all right before he had to leave the country for 6 weeks for his university work. Being apart was very difficult, but it didn't bring the fights I feared, like the ones of jealousy or him being controlling of where I was and with whom. Instead they mostly came from me, because I felt he was pulling away and things felt off. I had visited him for a week in between it all. I told him I felt insecure, like he no longer wanted me, like something was off. He blamed it on his work and that he was occupied mentally and he did get sick that week too. I left it for what it was that week.   
A few days after I returned home from my visit to him, he told me he wanted to quit therapy. It was a blow to the face for me, since it was holding on to it as if it were a lifeline. I told him this and he promised me he would rethink it and for me not to worry. We would talk about it when he returned.   
In that moment though, I think a lot of damage already got done for me, I felt like he turned his back on us and betrayed me. I had a gut instinct, something was coming. I felt scared, because I had just been there with him for a week and he said this right after I left. That week we barely called or texted. I felt wary and was very moody.   
I keep regretting the next part the most, because in my head I keep thinking the actual break up is all my fault.   
I picked him up from the airport last week. I should have been happy to seem him, hug him and love him. But I couldn't. When you're apart you miss someone and have all these thoughts, you romanticize everything. But the moment I saw him, I felt angry and hurt because of everything, not just the therapy he wanted to quit, but the stacked up frustration of everything that hung between us.   
I gave him a kiss and a hug, but I couldn't smile much and the walk to the car was painfully awkward and filled with annoyance mostly from my side. We got in an argument when I told him I had to stop by the supermarket, he asked me if it was going to be long or short run and I felt upset more, like after 6 weeks apart he could not bare a moment at the supermarket with me. In hindsight it's small and pointless. But in the moment it gave me a wave of annoyance, I told him he could go home by train if he didn't have time to come. It was very unkind and I didn't apologize right away. I was just filled with emotions.   
The car ride home was terrible. And when we finally got home it was awkward. We sat down at the kitchen table like a cliché and there was nothing to be said. So after some awkward small talk I asked him if he wanted to break up, if that was, what was on his mind. And he said yes. And he was serious this time. I thought he was joking at first. But he pointed out that my behavior at the airport was what pushed him over the edge.   
Sincerely I think it wasn't just that, but until now I can't let go of the guilt. I cried and I even begged him to take some time to think and to not leave me. We were apart for six weeks and we had seen each other for barely two hours. I felt so stupid, I still feel stupid. I just started to panic I think. But when I realized he was set his choice, I left and I went to my moms. 

He hasn't contacted me since and I only contacted him when I asked him to leave the house for an hour so I could pick some belongings of mine. All of my stuff is still there. All the important financial things are all in my name still, so I still need to confront him about it all. But I don't know how. I'm scared that if I see him I will go weak and hurt more.

I know deep down that maybe things are better this way. I'm a very creative and open person, I was always calm and kind and I don't recognize the person I became when I was with him.   
I know that now I can see friends again, that if I want to model draw I am allowed, that I can go somewhere for a night away with my mom without fearing his reaction or his disappointment. I can do my work, selling at events on weekends without knowing he disapproves of me being gone on some weekends, I can go to a concert with a friend if I like. I'm essentially free again.   
But to navigate this renewed freedom is so difficult. I feel like I lost my identity to some extend. Without him I feel like I am nothing. The future I focused on when things were difficult is gone now. The children we thought names of will never come. The trips we were going to make, will be made on our own.  
It sounds all a bit dramatic maybe. But I know that along the years our respect for one another got lost. I used to think the world of him and put him on a pedestal, I was so proud of us and wanted everyone to see us together, for them to know that we were together. I lost after many fights, where trust just crumbles bit by bit.  
Now I wonder what I'm grieving the most, him as himself or is it the idea of us and him and what could have been, mixed with all the memories of a first love? First time living together, first time meeting family.   
I will miss his mother and sister a lot. In the few times I spend time with them, because he's from Italy (We're both half Italian, but I'm half Dutch too and he's half Brazilian) and stayed with them, they are very very special to me. I almost feel like I need his mom in all this, but that would cross all boundaries... and sincerely I hope he can be open with her and talk with her, because she's so patient and comforting. 

I don't know how to go from here. I know it's one foot in front of the other. But to navigate the world again alone, to learn from my own mistakes, but to also let go that of that I simply could not understand him and he couldn't understand me is going to be difficult. I need to relearn myself, what I want from life etc. It's hard to know that he never strayed from his goal of an academic career and has that to hold on to during hard times, while I was so set on becoming a mother and be with him and now that he's gone, I'm free falling.   
He is a not a bad person, nor am I and nor are we both good either and as I write this I cry cause I will miss him so much. We all have flaws and a relationship is like mirror, we see ourselves and that is confronting.  
I hope I will grow too and I will be stronger too, to stand behind my choices and guard better my boundaries, so I won't hurt no one either anymore or let anyone hurt me like this again.  
He reasoned the way he did and so did I, I know I did my best with the tools and knowhow I had at the time. And I can only hope that so did he.  
Stupidly I wish he would read this. But I think he processes things in his own way. I'm glad neither of us use social media much and I turned my time and online status on WhatsApp off, or I would go crazy wondering about him. Checking when he was last online and all that.  
  
Though... If you do read this. Know that I will miss you. Very much. I'm sorry for the times we hurt each other, intentionally or not.   
I will always have a special place in my heart for you. Despite everything, you are part of the reason for who I will become after this. And I can only hope that you will think back of me with some love too. To wish me well and know that what we had was real and that we did our best. I don't hate you and I hope you don't hate me either.   
And I know you believe in god and you're catholic and sometimes I wonder if it was easier if I was like that as well... but I hope that in another life, another place, another time... somehow we meet again. Maybe after our souls grow more.  And if there is a god like you believe, then I hope this is part of something bigger, that although I'm not in a place to believe right now, he will not forsake me and I will at least meet you again one day.   
I hope that at some point the tears of sadness will make space of acceptance and peace.   
You're were special to me and I hope I was special to you.   
For now I will do my best to keep going, one step at the time and I'll just keep looking at my feet until I can take bigger steps and maybe some day... I hope not too terribly long from now, I dare to look up to see where I'm going. ",3,1746616520.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1kgun20,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1kgun20/does_berkland_surface_lock_ceramic_coating_truly/,Does Berkland Surface Lock Ceramic Coating Truly Transform Stainless Steel Surfaces Review?,"**My Daily Experience with the Berkland B0BZJVKG27 Surface Lock Home Ceramic Coating**

The Berkland B0BZJVKG27 Surface Lock Home Ceramic Coating landed in my cleaning arsenal at a perfect time. I have active kids who seem to think every shiny surface in the house is their personal fingerprint canvas. Stainless steel appliances, countertops—they’re all fair game. Testing this ceramic spray felt like a challenge in my daily battle against smudges and grime. What drew me in was its promise to create a superhydrophobic layer, repelling fingerprints and stains effortlessly. The idea of dealing with fewer streaks and shiny, polished surfaces had me ready to roll.  

**Good Points**  
- Activates instantly, saving time with no long curing process.  
- Compatible with a bunch of surfaces, from granite to glass and painted wood.  
- Non-toxic and food-safe, which is a huge deal for a household with kids.  

I decided to start small, applying the coating on my stainless steel refrigerator, which honestly looks like it’s been through war. The application turned out to be incredibly straightforward. Spray, spread evenly with a microfiber cloth, and wait for magic. True to its claims, the spray cured almost instantly—none of that greasy residue I’d dealt with in other similar products.  

Check [Berkland B0BZJVKG27 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0bzjvkg27/)

**The Versatile Range of Coverage**  
This is where the spray utterly shocked me. Unlike other cleaning products that seem exclusive to one type of surface, this solution is practically a jack-of-all-trades. Marble countertops, glass coffee tables, my bathroom sink, and even the painted wooden cabinets in the kitchen—no surface felt left out of its magic. I noticed it worked beautifully to lock out water spots and soap scum in the bathroom sink. And, yes, goodbye toothpaste buildup!  

Now let’s talk about its lasting effects. Once applied, the treated surfaces genuinely don’t need constant attention. I caught myself cleaning less, which is a win in my book. The long-lasting protection it provided on heavy-use surfaces like the kitchen countertop was nothing short of impressive.  

**Materials that Shine Post-Application**  
One of the standout features here is how versatile yet specialized it feels. For granite and marble countertops, this spray does more than repel water—it brings out a kind of sheen I didn’t know they had. Even on less glamorous surfaces like the simple tile backsplash in the kitchen, there’s an undeniable glow. A friend came over and even asked what I’d “done differently” to make my home look cleaner. The coating doesn’t just seal; it enhances.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Slightly expensive compared to traditional surface cleaners.  
- Needs consistent wiping during application to ensure no streaks are left behind.   

On stainless steel surfaces, I did find that if you’re not careful during the immediate post-spray wipe phase, it’s easy to leave streaks. It’s less a flaw of the product and more something that comes with its ultra-fast curing time. A slow wipe’s your best friend here.  

**Product Rivals**  
Looking at the competition, I’ve tried similar products like Weiman Stainless Steel Cleaner and TriNova’s Granite Sealer & Protector. While these aren’t bad options, they either left streaky residues or had lengthy curing processes. Berkland’s ceramic spray stands out for being super user-friendly and ridiculously quick. TriNova’s sealer, for instance, takes hours to cure properly. Who has time for that?  

Compared to them, this spray might seem pricey at first glance. However, the ultimate time saved on frequent cleaning and the long-lasting gloss it gives more than makes up for the difference.  

**Price Performance**  
I won’t sugarcoat it—the upfront cost for an 8-ounce bottle might make you hesitate, especially seeing how competing brands sell similar products at slightly lower price points. However, Berkland seems to have nailed the “cost-to-quality” balance. You’re not just paying for a cleaner; you’re investing in time saved and durability-enhanced surfaces. In this case, smart spending feels entirely justified.

1kgun1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/visas/comments/1kgun1t/japan_tourist_visa_from_mumbai_india_5_year/,"Japan Tourist Visa from Mumbai, India: 5 Year Multiple Entry Visa Granted [VFS Self-Application Experience]","
Hi folks, writing about my GF (27F) and my (28M) Japan visa experience from VFS Mumbai. I got my 5 year multiple entry visa while she got a 3 month 15-day single entry – a bit disappointed with her outcome since we applied together with similar profiles, but I think we know why. Hint: ITRs are important. We applied on the 28th of April and got our Visas delivered by courier in Mumbai today.

---

Firstly, VFS Mumbai doesn’t need an appointment. We both took leave on Friday to head to the centre in Mahalaxmi at 8am, to avoid the crowd, but since we live pretty far we made it in only by 8:20AM. We signed in at the register and everyone was nice and friendly, including the staff, who told us to head to the 3rd floor. At 8:20AM, the third floor was entirely empty, and we were the only ones there, not just for Japan but also for all other countries’ processing – including Germany, SA and a few Middle Eastern countries. Must commend VFS on the friendliness and cleanliness of the place – overall we were done in just under 25 minutes, and headed out to grab a coffee at 8:50AM.

---

I prepared the entire Visa documentation myself, on behalf of both of us. Let’s get into the documents and how I prepared:  
Followed this checklist: https://www.vfsglobal.com/Japan/India/Chennai/pdf/Checklist/Temporary-Visitor-Visa-for-Sightseeing-without-Guarantor.pdf

* **Passports**: VFS only took our original current passports though I had brought all our old passports too. My US visa is on my current passport but hers was on an old one, and she also had a Japan visitor visa from 2017 on her old one which was mentioned in the cover le.

* **Cover letter**: Since we were applying separately but in the same application docket, I wrote two cover letters. I initially wrote 2 variants for each of us, one for a multiple entry vis and one for single entry, but on reading this sub and talking to a few friends, I decided to only submit the single entry visa cover letter, without explicitly asking for a 5 year entry visa. In it, I mentioned a few key points:  
    * a. Occupation and where we work and how long we have worked, including recongisable past companies (we’ve both worked in top MNCs/FAANG)  
    * b. Financial status; in a single line, wrote my bank balance (>4L INR at the time), but mentioned my stock and MF portfolio (>50L but <1Cr). Did the same for her, with a similar bank balance but her portfolio is slightly lower (still more than >15L), which could have been a differentiator in not getting the 5Y visa. Used USD and INR figures in these.  
    * c. Mentioned our college in case that gave us some street cred (I don’t think it did but it’s a top 3 college in India)  
    * d. One line on our 7 day itinerary and places of interest (Kyoto, Tokyo, Nara)  
    * e. Past travel history: We both have US 10 year B1/B2 and I mentioned this, since they don’t always check the passports we submit. I wrote this line: “I maintain an extensive history of tourism, including visits to the United Kingdom (2013), Turkey (2018), Singapore (2009), Hong Kong (2007 & 2017), China (2007), Indonesia (2018), and Dubai (2024). Additionally, I hold a valid 10-year multiple-entry U.S. visa and plan to visit the United States for tourism in winter 2025.” Similar for both our letters.
    * f. Mentioned each other’s names and passport numbers in the cover letter. Since we are unmarried, I mentioned in the cover letter that we are long term partners who are travelling together

* **Itinerary**: used this format: https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/000262548.pdf  
    * a. I got OpenAI o3 to fill it out after inputing my hotel and flight tickets. Mentioned the airline numbers, and timings of flights.  
    * b. For contact, I mentioned the hotel phone numbers and airline phone numbers  
    * c. The VFS person was checking this itinerary and comparing it with both the cover letter and our individual documents. He was looking at discrepancies on timing, dates and Airline codes – he also asked whether we have visas for the layovers in Singapore and Vietnam, which is not needed since we aren’t exiting the airport. Since we have US visas, we are eligible for transit visas in both countries even though we won’t have time to go outside.

* **Bookings and tickets**: chose not to do dummy tickets since we were booking ~1 month away and were fairly confident in getting visas. Flight tickets for June were booked and hotel stays for our 7 day trip were also booked via Smartbuy and Booking dot com. Submitted the same copies in each of our applications but I’m glad I took two sets because each of our apps needed to have a separate set of copies of our tickets/bookings.

* **ITRs**: downloaded and submitted acknowledgements of 3 years ITRs (the one pager, not the full ITR). Honestly, this is where I think the difference in our visas arise from, as her ITR history is not as strong as mine. Still, all 3 years were submitted – the VFS agent gave back our 4 years' ago ITR.  
    * o. My ITR: >20L in past 3 years  
    * o. Her ITR: >20L in past 2 years but <5L 3 years ago

* **Bank statements**: This is where I think the fuckup happened. I took both our 12 Months bank statements. I also took copies of my portfolio holdings in case we needed proof of the MF and stocks (this was a 16 page consolidated report from my broker). The VFS agent did not add either of these to our files and gave it back to us. In the end, I asked him why we’re not adding bank statements, and he mentioned it’s not needed if we have all 3 years ITRs. This was fine to me, but in hindsight, insisting on adding her bank statement may have given her the 5 year – since it would have shown recent income. Not very sure if the outcome would have been different, but it’s worth noting atleast.

* **Payslips**: Had taken 3 months’ payslip copies for each – this was added to the file.

* **Employer NOC / Leave sanctioned letter**: We both got ours signed and stamped, and submitted originals. Companies are strong and well-known.

Although online reviews mention VFS doesn’t accept cards, Mumbai office **does**.  
We were done in ~25 minutes. Total cost: ₹3600 including GST.

**Result**  
- Application submitted: 28th April  
- Passports received: 7th May  
- Outcome: I got a 5-year multiple entry (up to 90 days), she got 3 months single entry (up to 15 days).

Surprising, as she has more travel history (Europe, UK, US in last 3 years).  
But ITRs & financials seem to have made the difference.",1,1746616105.0,visas,0,1.0,False

I’m a software developer working on an idea and I’d love to get your feedback.

I’m thinking of creating a platform similar to *Buy Me a Coffee* or *Ko-fi*, but entirely based on Bitcoin instead of fiat payments. The goal is to make it easy for creators, developers, artists, or anyone really, to receive tips or small donations in BTC from their supporters.

The core idea is simplicity: no need to set up or self-host anything—just an easy-to-use page where supporters can send Bitcoin directly.

Would something like this be useful to you or the Bitcoin community in general?  
What features would you expect or want in such a platform?  
Are there existing solutions you think already cover this well?

What's the largest practical brew you can get with a V60 02 size? 

I am fooling around with V60 more. I have tried some of the recipes that call for fairly small doses of coffee. 12 grams. 15 grams. I find that it's hard to do those since the water amounts are smaller (still keeping ratio around 16:1). I've moved up to 20 grams coffee and about 330 grams water.
Seems easier. Brew times around 2:30 or so

But how much can I go? 20 grams coffee and 330 grams water fills a normal mug. Maybe about 300 ml. When I brew with my BONAVITA IMMERSION DRIPPER, I do 25 grams coffee and 400 grams water. More coffee. more than fits in the same mug. So, I can top it off. I can push that device a bit. Up to close to 500 grams of water. But more than that, it would overflow.

But if I want even MORE coffee in one brew, can I do it with a v60 02? Like what is the MOST you make in one shot. Coffee does size, water amount, and then brew time to aim for would be helpful.

The Owens family had a beloved younger cousin whom Matheo adored.

For Millie's sake, Matheo cruelly pushed his pregnant fiancée, Selene, down a flight of stairs, causing her to lose their child. Selene lay unconscious, surrounded by a pool of blood, while echoes of Millie's accusations rang in her ears.

""Is that enough, Brother?""

""When I was in high school, she tormented me—slapping me, pouring dirty water on me, stripping me, locking me in the boys' restroom, ruining my life. I had to drop out and recover abroad.""

""She almost took my life! Yet you still protect her?""

In reality, it was Selene who had been bullied. But Matheo believed Millie's every word. ""What more do you want?""

""I want to be your bride. Even if I'm just a substitute for her, I'll settle for that.""

""Alright.""

Determined to escape, Selene accepted an offer from a famous director and fled abroad to focus on her acting career. Matheo roamed the world searching for her, lost and desolate. On his ninety-ninth proposal, she finally agreed to marry him.

Under dazzling fireworks, Matheo spun Selene around in a midsummer night's garden.

""Selene, I love you. I want you to be the happiest woman in the world.""

Their wedding was planned for June tenth.

On the morning of June third, Selene learned that Millie was returning to the country. Overwhelmed by emotion, she spilled most of her coffee.

Matheo took the mug from her, retrieved a wet wipe, and gently cleaned her hand, studying her expression. ""What's wrong?""

Her thoughts were racing. ""Let's go get the marriage license.""

Matheo lovingly brushed her hair and laughed, ""Okay!""

He slid a diamond ring onto her finger with steady precision. ""Selene, once we're married, you'll no longer be alone but the lady of the Owens family, my wife.""

As they prepared to leave, Matheo received a call from Millie.

""Already at the airport?""

""Wait, I'll be right there.""

Handing Selene the document pouch, Matheo said, ""We'll get the license another day. You whip up something delicious for when we're back.""

Trying to mask her disappointment, she forced a smile, ""What would you like?""

Matheo kissed her cheek, ""Anything you make will be perfect.""

Selene spent the day cooking. By evening, Millie burst in with roses, grinning at Selene. ""Look, sis.""

""He said he'd welcome me with flowers and bought ninety-nine roses! I thought a crazed admirer was about to confess—I dared not approach.""

""What a blunder! What if someone gets the wrong idea?""

Matheo entered, arms loaded with luxury shopping bags, even holding some with his teeth while the staff helped him. He chuckled, ""Alright, alright, Princess, whatever you say.""

Millie strutted with pride, ""That's more like it.""

She dashed into the kitchen, scrutinizing the nine dishes and three soups Selene had painstakingly prepared.

""Sis, you're quite the homemaker, but unfortunately, I'm not used to Western food.""

Millie leaned close to Selene's ear, whispering venomously, ""Don't think you're going to rise above. Even if Matheo doesn't marry me, it won't be you, poor orphan!""

Selene felt herself plunge into a chilling abyss, past torments flooding back to consume her.

Millie masked her expression, draped an arm around Selene's shoulders, and faced Matheo. ""Let's go for fondue, sis wants some too.""

At the fondue restaurant, Matheo ordered a table full of Millie's favorites. By the time Selene ordered, the table was already brimming.

Millie constantly served Matheo, chatting warmly, leaving Selene feeling sidelined. Noticing her isolation, Millie smirked, ""Sorry, sis, we didn't mean to ignore you, but...""

""We're discussing investments, stocks, finances—you wouldn't follow.""

""Exactly,"" Matheo agreed, ""you wouldn't get it!""

""You have to be kidding!""

Suddenly, the neighboring table erupted in chaos. Chairs flipped, and food and drink spilled onto the floor. Before Selene could react, a burly man grabbed the fondue pot and launched it in their direction!

""Look out!""

Matheo instinctively shielded Millie. Selene couldn't dodge in time, and the scalding fondue spilled over her, burning her as if her skin had been peeled away.

She screamed in agony.

Matheo moved to check on her, but Millie tugged at his sleeve. ""Brother, it hurts.""

Millie whimpered, extending her pale arm stained with spicy sauce.

Tenderly, Matheo scooped Millie into his arms. ""Off to the hospital!""

He didn't even spare Selene a glance.

Kind diners called an ambulance for Selene. The restaurant staff ushered her to the back, rinsing her wounds with cool water, easing the burning somewhat.

Trembling from pain, tears streaming down her face, Selene retrieved her phone and dialed the number.

""Mr. Johnston, I'm ready to accept the role, but I've been burned. I might need a few days.""

The director sounded elated, ""That's fantastic news.""

""Don't worry, we're filming a period drama, so your injuries won't matter.""

""No need for auditions—join us on June tenth.""

June tenth—the very day of her wedding.

Looks like she won't be attending.",1,1746615660.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

# Best Cups for Drinks 2025: Ultimate Buying Guide

Choosing the right cups for drinks is more important than many people realize. From the everyday morning coffee to special occasion cocktails, the cup significantly impacts the drinking experience. The material, size, shape, and insulation of a cup can influence temperature retention, taste perception, and even the overall enjoyment of the beverage. With the ever-growing array of options available, selecting the perfect cups for your needs can be overwhelming. This comprehensive guide will explore the best cups for drinks in 2025, covering various types, key features, benefits, and considerations to help you make an informed decision.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The modern beverage cup comes in a dizzying array of materials and designs. Understanding the critical specifications will help you select a cup that matches your lifestyle and beverage preferences.

**Material:** This is arguably the most crucial factor. Cups are commonly made from glass, ceramic, stainless steel, plastic (various types), and paper.

The choice of material significantly affects the taste, temperature retention, and durability of the cup. Glass and ceramic are neutral in taste and often preferred for hot beverages and fine drinks. Stainless steel provides excellent insulation and durability, ideal for travel mugs and outdoor use. Plastic is lightweight and inexpensive but can sometimes impart flavors or leach chemicals, depending on the type. Paper cups are disposable and convenient but less environmentally friendly unless compostable.

**Insulation:** This feature determines how well the cup maintains the temperature of the beverage.

Insulation is primarily achieved through double-walled construction, vacuum sealing, or the use of insulating materials like foam or neoprene sleeves. Double-walled stainless steel cups with vacuum insulation are particularly effective at keeping drinks hot or cold for extended periods. Insulated cups are essential for those who want to enjoy their beverages at the desired temperature for longer, whether it's a steaming cup of coffee or an icy smoothie.

**Size and Capacity:** Cups come in various sizes, typically measured in ounces or milliliters.

The appropriate size depends on the intended use and beverage. Smaller cups (8-12 ounces) are suitable for coffee or tea, while larger cups (16-24 ounces or more) are better for iced drinks, smoothies, or water. Consider the capacity you need based on your typical beverage consumption and the frequency of refills you prefer. Also, consider the size of your cup holders in your car or at your desk.

**Lid and Closure Design:** For travel mugs and on-the-go cups, the lid and closure mechanism are essential.

A secure and leak-proof lid prevents spills and keeps beverages contained while traveling. Different lid designs offer varying degrees of convenience and functionality. Some lids have sliding closures, while others have flip-top mechanisms or straw openings. The material and design of the lid also impact insulation and ease of cleaning.

**Ergonomics and Grip:** The shape and texture of the cup influence its comfort and ease of handling.

Ergonomic designs with contoured shapes or textured surfaces provide a secure and comfortable grip, reducing the risk of spills and improving the overall drinking experience. Cups with handles are easier to hold for hot beverages, while those without handles may be more compact and easier to store. Consider the weight and balance of the cup as well, as these factors can affect comfort during prolonged use.

**Durability and Maintenance:** The cup's resistance to damage and the ease of cleaning and maintaining it are crucial for long-term use.

Durable materials like stainless steel and shatter-resistant glass withstand frequent use and accidental drops. Dishwasher-safe cups are more convenient to clean than those that require hand washing. Consider the cup's resistance to staining and odors, as well as the ease of disassembling and cleaning lids and other components. Proper maintenance extends the lifespan of the cup and ensures a hygienic drinking experience.

 ## Core Benefits

Choosing the right cup for your drinks offers numerous advantages, enhancing your overall drinking experience and providing long-term value.

**Enhanced Temperature Retention:** A good insulated cup keeps hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for extended periods. This is particularly beneficial for those who commute, travel, or simply want to savor their beverages at the desired temperature. Imagine enjoying a hot cup of coffee throughout your morning commute or keeping a refreshing iced tea cold during a hot summer day, all thanks to a well-insulated cup.

**Improved Taste Preservation:** The material of the cup can significantly affect the taste of the beverage. Glass and ceramic are neutral and do not impart any unwanted flavors, allowing you to fully appreciate the true taste of your drink. Stainless steel can also be a good option if it is of high quality and does not have any metallic taste. Avoid cups made of low-quality plastic, as they may leach chemicals and alter the taste of your beverage.

**Increased Convenience and Portability:** Travel mugs and cups with secure lids make it easy to enjoy your drinks on the go without worrying about spills. They are perfect for commuters, travelers, and anyone who wants to stay hydrated throughout the day. Many travel mugs are designed to fit in car cup holders and are easy to carry, making them a convenient choice for busy individuals.

**Reduced Environmental Impact:** Choosing reusable cups over disposable ones helps reduce waste and protect the environment. By using a reusable cup, you can significantly decrease your contribution to landfills and reduce the demand for single-use plastics and paper products. Investing in a high-quality, durable reusable cup is an environmentally responsible choice that benefits both you and the planet.

**Health and Safety:** Using BPA-free plastic or stainless steel cups eliminates the risk of harmful chemicals leaching into your drinks. This is especially important for children and pregnant women. Ensure that the cups you choose are made from food-grade materials and are free from harmful substances like BPA, phthalates, and lead. Prioritizing health and safety when selecting cups ensures a worry-free drinking experience.

 ## FAQs Section

Answering common questions can help clarify the benefits and features of different cups.

**Are stainless steel cups safe to use?**
    Yes, high-quality stainless steel cups are generally considered safe. Look for food-grade stainless steel (typically 18/8 or 304) to avoid potential leaching of metals. Ensure the cup is from a reputable brand and properly maintained.

**How do I clean insulated cups effectively?**
    Most insulated cups can be cleaned with warm soapy water and a bottle brush. For stubborn stains or odors, use a mixture of baking soda and water or a specialized cleaning tablet designed for insulated bottles. Check the manufacturer's instructions for dishwasher compatibility, as some insulated cups may not be dishwasher-safe.

**What is the best type of cup for hot beverages?**
    Insulated stainless steel cups are excellent for keeping hot beverages hot for extended periods. Ceramic cups are also a good choice, as they retain heat well and do not impart any unwanted flavors. Glass cups can also be used, but they may not retain heat as effectively as stainless steel or ceramic.

**Are all plastic cups BPA-free?**
    Not all plastic cups are BPA-free, so it's essential to check the product label. Look for cups made from BPA-free materials like Tritan, polypropylene (PP), or polyethylene (PE). Avoiding BPA helps reduce the risk of exposure to this potentially harmful chemical.

The remaining one and I decided to continue with the business with the idea that since he had a business before he be able to lead us in the right direction. We tried going to the the small business development center and to get help I'm just figuring out what we would need for a loan, but they were not helpful at all and neither were the banks. frankly the banks told us that we couldn't get a loan until tax returns came back which at the time would take three-five months.  This would be unreasonable with our clientel. In an attempt to try to retain clients and earn money until we could get a loan or tax returns came back we decide the tutor out of coffee shops, but frankly, it just wasn't working. So we decided to look for a building and hopes of retaining more clients. We finally found one that was cheap enough after two months but by that time we have lost a lot more clients than we expected, and we just haven't been able to rebuild clientele, school coming to an end. At this point, I don't know what to do, besides try to get another a loan again. Any suggestions? ",1,1746615379.0,smallbusiness,2,1.0,False

After discovering that Kason had been secretly seeing his mistress for three years and was planning to marry her, I decided to leave him and return home for an arranged marriage.

On the first day, I handed the engagement ring he had given me to his mistress.

On the second day, I discarded everything that reminded me of him.

On the third day, I put on my wedding dress and married his arch-rival, Ronan.

From that day forward, Kason and I were no longer connected.

Kason scoffed, thinking I was just throwing a tantrum.

Until he saw the news of my marriage to someone else.

Only then did he panic.

==============================

In the office, the two of them were completely unaware of my presence outside the door.

I poured out the coffee I had made for Kason and left.

Kason had always kissed me with such care, so I had never seen him so passionate before.

Now I knew it was because he had given that side of himself to someone else.

I had thought I could marry for love, but reality had hit me hard.

Numb and disheveled, I wiped away my tears and took a cab back to the mansion.

As soon as I got out of the car, several unfamiliar messages came through.

They were from Ximena.

""You heard it, didn’t you? Mr. Henry is going to give me a wedding even grander than yours.""

Reading those words, my heart still clenched.

He had once said that he would only ever step into a wedding hall with me.

But now, the wedding we had been looking forward to for so long had become a tool to placate his little bird.

Seeing that I hadn’t replied, Ximena sent several more photos.

In them, she and Kason were entwined, their intimacy unmistakable.

""Has he ever loved you like this?""

I gave a bitter smile and didn’t respond.

Instead, I saved the chat history and walked into the mansion.

Less than half an hour after I got home, Kason arrived with a large bouquet of roses.

The roses were fragrant, but I could still detect that unique sweetness on him.

Before, he had only carried my scent.

But now, it was no longer mine.

When I pushed him away, Kason looked momentarily stunned but quickly recovered.

He kissed the corner of my mouth, as if coaxing a child, and spoke softly to me for a long time.

In the past, this was how he would calm me down when he made me angry, and I would always forgive him after just a few words.

But this time, I didn’t want to forgive.

Seeing my lack of response, Kason pulled out a red velvet box from his pocket.

""Luisa, look what this is.""

I opened the box to find the royal diamond ring I had wanted for so long.

Back then, Kason had felt guilty for not being able to buy it for me.

But now, seeing the hidden guilt in his eyes, I knew it was just a bribe after his betrayal.

Remembering the promises Kason had made to me, I instinctively looked at him.

""Luisa, I’ve finally given it to you, this ring that belongs only to you.""

""From now on, it’s just you and me, forever.""

My fingers traced the ring, but my heart felt as if it were being torn apart.

Kason, you still remember the promises you made back then, so how could you change your heart now?

With a bitter smile, I took off the ring, but Kason grabbed my hand, his voice urgent.

""Luisa, what are you doing?""

""Don’t you like it anymore?""

A flash of panic crossed Kason’s eyes, but I hid my feelings and spoke calmly.

""Rings are most meaningful when given on the wedding day.""

I saw Kason visibly relax, but my heart ached unbearably.

Once, I had hoped to grow old with you, to spend our lives together.

But now, Kason, we have no future.

He put the ring away, slapping his forehead in frustration.

""It’s my fault for being so impatient, Luisa.""

""But the thought of finally being able to marry you makes me so eager.""

Kason grew more and more excited as he spoke, and in the past, I would have been moved to tears.

But now, I just looked at him calmly, my face expressionless.

Seeing my calm demeanor, a flicker of guilt passed through his eyes, and he was about to say something.

But then his phone lit up, and Kason’s face darkened, only to turn excited the moment he saw the message.

He scrolled through the screen, his Adam’s apple bobbing, a flash of desire in his eyes.

Then he turned off the screen and sighed, feigning regret.

""Luisa, I’m sorry, but something’s come up at the office. I have to go.""

Before I could respond, Kason rushed out, not even grabbing his coat.

I still called out to him, ""Is it really something important?""

He froze at my words, then smiled and said, ""Of course it is. Why would I lie to you? Wait for me, I’ll be back.""

Then he turned and left without hesitation.

I knew he was going to see Ximena.

And I knew he wouldn’t be coming back tonight.

Looking at the empty room, I suddenly laughed.

I had once told him that if he lied to me and I found out, I would leave his world forever.

Kason, since you lied to me.

We’ll never see each other again.",1,1746614916.0,NovelNexus,1,1.0,False

I’m working on turning a funny story from my life into an animation video, but I’m having trouble making it flow well and keeping it funny. Here’s the rough draft of the story:

My Story:



During the Easter holidays, my family and I flew to Romania for a week to visit my grandma and uncle.

We packed everything beforehand. I had a small red backpack where I put all my clothes, cables, and my external hard drive.

My parents also packed some small things into my backpack for my grandma and uncle – like coffee.

But there was no room left for my laptop and graphic tablet. So I put both of them into a fabric shopping bag.

At that point, I was basically ready to travel.



The next day, we headed to the airport. Everything went smoothly – until the security check. That’s when the problem started.

I put my electronics onto the belt, like you do when flying, and I saw someone else putting down a graphic tablet – and next to it, I saw the stylus.

And that’s when it hit me: \*\*Did I even pack my stylus?!\*\* Panic.

My brother noticed and asked, ""What’s wrong?"" I told him dude i think I left my stylus at home.



But I couldn’t just dig through my backpack right there – it was packed to the max, and our flight was leaving in 10 minutes.

That ended up being the worst flight of my life.

My mind kept spinning: \*Did I pack it? Did I forget it?\*



It got so bad that I started imagining options:

Buy a new one online? No, not worth it for one week.

Buy one in the city? Also no – my grandma lives in a super remote village in the middle of nowhere.

Even the road isn’t paved. The nearest town is an hour away – and it’s a small one. No chance of finding a replacement there.



I was stuck in that anxiety loop the whole flight.

So I ordered a nice tomato soup to calm down – I love tomatoes. It helped… a little.



After two hours, we finally landed.

But it still wasn’t over.

Now we had a two-hour car ride ahead – my uncle was already waiting for us at the airport.

We got into his car and drove off. My mom asked me what was wrong.

I told her the situation.

She was like, “I’m sure you packed it.”

I was like, “I’m not sure. I’m 90% sure I forgot it.”

She said, “Wanna bet? If it’s in there, you’re coming to church with me and grandma tomorrow.”

I said, “Alright, fine.”



We arrived. I greeted my grandma and we went to our rooms – my parents in one, me and my brother in the guest room.



\*\*Now the moment of truth had come.\*\*

I opened my backpack.

I took out my clothes, cables, headphones...

No stylus.



At that point, I was pretty sure: I really had forgotten it.



Then I opened the front pocket – the one with the coffee for my uncle and grandma.

And there, behind the coffee, at the very bottom... was my stylus.



My brother laughed so hard.

He said, “If you had just moved the coffee at the airport, you would’ve seen it and saved yourself four hours of stress.”



Then my dad said, “Oh, I saw the stylus when I put the coffee in your bag.”

And my mom was like, “That’s what you get for not believing in God.”



My brother was cracking up.

He said, “You HAVE to make a video about this.”

And I was like, “No way – people will just laugh at me…”

  


I’m trying to turn this into a funny animation script, but I’m not sure how to improve the flow, timing, or humor. Can anyone give me tips on making it more engaging and funnier, or even help me with rewriting the script to fit a video format?\*\*



Any feedback or suggestions would be much appreciated!

1kgu1xv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteItRight/comments/1kgu1xv/best_essay_writing_service_comparison_study_tips/,👉 Best essay writing service comparison + study tips!,"Let’s face it — writing essays in college is basically a competitive sport. Between endless coursework, part-time jobs, and trying to remember the last time you slept, it’s no wonder students turn to the occasional essay writing service online for backup.

In this post, I’m breaking down three popular writing services — [PaperCoach](https://paper-coach.fun/)**,** [SpeedyPaper](https://speedypaper.fun/)**,** and [EssayMarket ](https://essay-market.space/)— and giving you some study hacks so you’re not pulling another all-nighter fueled by energy drinks and regret.

# 💡 Tips to Level Up Your Essay Game

Before you even think of using a writing paper service, here are some study hacks to save you:

* ✅ **Plan your structure early** — Intro, body, conclusion. Sounds obvious, but skipping this step leads to Frankenstein essays that even you can’t follow.
* ✅ **Break it into chunks** — Writing 2,000 words feels impossible, but four 500-word sections? Totally doable.
* ✅ **Use credible sources + cite as you go** — Trust me, trying to remember where that quote came from at 2 a.m. is not the vibe.
* ✅ **Edit with fresh eyes** — Walk away, grab coffee, then come back to spot awkward sentences.

And please… if you’ve ever started your essay with **“Webster’s Dictionary defines…”** — we’re here to save you! 😅

3. **Do writing services guarantee deadlines?** Reputable services (like the three above) do — but read the fine print, especially on rush orders.
4. **How can I be sure my work is original?** Most sites offer plagiarism reports; you can also run drafts through free online checkers.
5. **How do I choose the best essay writing service?** It depends! Think about price, urgency, and whether you want to pick your writer.
6. **What should I do if I’m unhappy with the service?** Ask for revisions — good services include them. If that fails, escalate to customer support or dispute the order.

Bottom line? Writing services can be total game-changers when you’re overwhelmed. Whether you’re looking for a cheap writing service, a fast paper writing service, or the best research paper writing service, these platforms have your back.

Good luck — and may your next deadline be slightly less terrifying!",1,1746613955.0,WriteItRight,0,1.0,False

So, I suffer from night terrors and bad dreams. I would wake up in a cold sweat having my sister across the room tell me it's ok- and by her reports, until I started listening to music to appease my bad dreams, I got these night terrors often where I would scream and cry.

I thought my bad dreams were the night terrors, cuz I would wake up in fear and sobbing from em- but apparently you can't remember night terrors.

In any case, controlling my waking world and what I take in has helped, along with my rule ""don't sleep without music"". I could tell, mid dream, when my music may have turned off- and as always, as the dream became worse, I couldn't leave it on my own accord. (Im curious if this could lead to an ability to lucid dream, cuz I know I'm dreaming when this happens and be aware of my sleeping body- but just not ""break out""


*ACTUAL DREAM*

I'll focus on the second dream I had last night. The first wasnt apart of it and there was a space of time between the two. (Perhaps that's when my music stopped). 

Me, my siblings and family were all tree people, or more so we were the roots. And there was this room where my parents would cut a root from the wall- and my and my plant-siblings would feel the pain until one of us was sacrificed to my parents gods (or the tree). 

And I ran, some siblings ran. And we spoke. 
We were in danger still, in pain. We could feel it all...

And so I went back, I looked at the roots and felt the anger of the gods as I started cutting the ones on the left wall.(separate from the ones me and my siblings were apart of).
I could feel them- monsters or my parents, if they were different- coming to stop me.
But it was too late, as I cut the last root the gods were attached to. I felt a rumble and yell, the root I had just cut turned into Mjolnir, and I felt the looming dread that I was about to be torn to shreds once whoever it was (parents or monsters) entered the room.

Then my alarm went off.

Usually I don't write down bad dreams. I believe that if I write down the weird or good ones, that my brain will continue focusing on them. And most likely, I will remember the bad dreams anyway.

But this one was diffrent- 
The pattern was the same- something was wrong. Dreadful.
I would run as much as I could, hide- but I was always found. And when I was found, I would be torn apart. And not wake up till they were done. Feel the separation of limbs and skin, the slink of organs past my stomach- I felt it, would finally wake up, and feel in danger in my room.

But this time, I followed the pattern... but I stopped running.
I went back to the roots, knowing they would come. And I cut and slashed, feeling them nearing as I killed their gods.
I stood there and accepted my fate, but knew I had won as I was enveloped and the alarm went off.

I didn't run this time. I went towards it, actively doing something to try and stop it. To hurt them instead.


*Ties I made for recent waking stuff*

Yesterday I drank coffee at 4pm like a dummy, n was up till 11 freaking out over my car situation, school, family, lonelyness, and life- as per usual. (I just turned 22, kicked out at 20, live on my own, and I'm catching up in college in order to go to university in the fall for my bachelor's).

But I also stopped n scolded myself, n recorded a list on my voice log of what to do the following day. Which turned into ordering myself to be careful with myself, that it will be ok and just follow the plan, and how important sleep and proper food will be for may, which is proving to be a hectic month. That I can focus on the future, but also focus on how for the present moment, there is nothing I could do but breath and keep going. Continuation.
And before bed, I cursed Loki for ""noticing I was getting to comfortable"".

During meditation the other day (I work through the gateway tapes) I did the 5 questions in wave 3.
Nothing came of it, other then midway through when I felt the presence of Odin. Nothing said or done, just him watching me. 
Now, as to avoid spiritual psychosis, I remind myself how when I am looking for guidance or think of wisdom, I think of Odin. So it could be my subconscious throwing out what I think of when I'm asking questions that partain to my purpose or what I should do.
(Grew up christian, and I work hard not to dive head first into another religion uncontrollably. I fear having spiritual psychosis effect how I see everyday life and those around me, so I try grounding myself when possible).

I bring this up, as since then I decided to delve more into runelore.
And trees have been showing up more in my life somehow. The feeling of bark and roots, whether in meditation or music when I drive- my mind is on trees and plants and their movement. Months ago when I started the tapes, I also started having a ""personal life tree"" that, during non-guided meditations when I have intense emotions or thoughts, I prune and dump the rotten fruit and branches in the river (negetive thoughts and fears). If I'm hydrated, the river flowed better.

And now this dream, which breaks my past nightmares by running into danger- is covered in roots and trees- and Mjolnir and the norse voices behind the roots of the walls.

So that's me this morning.
Good morning.

My name is Anaiah Ross. I'm the most hated wolf in the pack because when I shifted into my wolf for the first time, I killed Tomas Rivers, our Alpha's brother, who attempted to rape me.

Tomas Rivers was a pedophile who used to touch me in the most inappropriate way when no one was watching. That's why I'm not sorry I killed him.

Since that day, the pack has been mistreating and bullying me. They beat, starve me and make me clean the pack house day in and day out. I tried to tell them that it was only self-defense but they didn't believe me. Tomas's wife, Leah, who denied all the accusations and said that her husband was the perfect man, but I know she knows the truth.

Even my parents turned their backs on me because, after the murder, they were demoted from their Gamma status to Omegas. Omegas are considered the weakest link of the pack, others are strong, but most of them are just cleaners and help out around the pack. They have no major role to play, like fighting in wars or any important pack political business.

""Where is that bitch!"" Leah sneers. I roll my eyes because of everyone here, she makes my life a living hell. I was supposed to be banished after I killed Tomas but my parents pleaded and asked on my behalf, saying that it was my first shift and just lost control.

I get out of my tiny room, it is very small and has almost an old walk-in closet, next to the store room on the second floor. There is a mattress and an old broken mirror. I only have a few clothes, shoes, and a collection of my favorite books.

I get out of the room, mentally preparing myself for all the insults and beating I'm to receive. I groan. Once in the main room, I see Leah standing elegantly in a long dress and heels, one hand on her hip as she taps her feet against the floor in impatience, the other hand holding a yellow fabric that she throws in my face as soon as I'm at arm's reach. I remove it from my face and throw it on the floor, annoyed.

""Um..."" I trail pointing at the dress on the floor. Leah looks livid now and I didn't expect her to slap me, no, I did. She slaps me hard across my face and blood splatters from my nose as I fell to the ground from the impact of her slap. She kicks me once again in the stomach and I grunt.

""I told you to hand wash it!"" She yells. I cover my face with my arms as my face blow after blow. It has been like this since her husband died and I'm here to take all her hate.

I picked myself up from the floor after Leah was tired of beating me. I go to the Omega bathroom to clean my body, the cold water hits my body and I shiver. Slowly, I clean my body and leave the bathroom, using the lotion I left there and wearing the clothes I wore earlier. I am going to get started on breakfast. The packed house has over 100 people staying here, they live in luxurious suites with their families, while others who are unmatched or without families have designer rooms.

With only a few other Omegas to help me, I prepared breakfast. There are sausages, bacon, toast, eggs, and beans, they eat a full English breakfast every morning. I start to serve when I see him, Amos, he's our future Alpha and one of the strongest wolves there is, he's a big player and a Cassanova. But I still have a small crush on him.

Keyword; Small.

He mostly irritates me and bullies me like others. The last time I spilled coffee on his girlfriend Eunice, he slapped me. My wolf wanted to fight back but I knew he could end our lives in an instant.

Amos's eyes met mine and he visibly stiffened and widened his eyes. I ignore his weird behavior and continue serving breakfast. Ignoring all the snarky comments they are throwing my way. I look at my parents but they only look at me with disgust and hate in their gaze. I swallow and inhale, walking away sadly. Tears were well in my eyes but I didn't cry. I can't be weak. I need to leave this place once I'm eighteen and start a new life for myself, so I promised myself to be strong. I will survive, I will take all the beating.

'Don't worry, our mate will love us,' beams my wolf, Chalo.

A mate is a soulmate that completes a wolf's life. Once they are in pain, it is felt by the other and my wolf has been wanting to get one since we learned what mates are, and she believes he will save us from all the pain and torture. He will love us forever and we will have a beautiful family I didn't have.

I see a few students going to school and I smile. I miss school even though all they did was prank me, but my teachers were good to me because I was a straight A student and would win most competitions. The Alpha and Luna stopped my education in my sophomore because they said they can't waste their resources on me when all I'm good for is cleaning and cooking, plus, let's face it, I wasn't going to get into a good college.

After I was done with my chores, I decided to get some vitamin D outside as my skin was too pale due to being indoors. I smile when the sun hits my skin and my wolf purrs. I hid in the bleachers while watching the warriors of the pack train. I like to observe them while they train so that I can know some basics about defending myself.

The Dawnrise is not the strongest there is and has survived thus far by maintaining a good relationship with other strong packs like the Lycans who are royalty to us. The Dawnrise's worst fear is angering a stronger pack. Hence, every year, they hold a ceremony to renew their treaties where they feast and celebrate alliances that were made many years ago.

I feel a hand roughly grab my hair from behind and I fall on my back facing the sky. Eunice is standing over me, her arms crossed over her chest with a triumphant smile on her face. I scowl and try to get up, but a kick in my stomach stops me. She and her two bimbos hit me several times and she snarls.
