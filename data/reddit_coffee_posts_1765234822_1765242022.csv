1phtxyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anemic/comments/1phtxyt/19_yo_female_iron_deficiency_and_symptoms_not/,19 y/o female Iron deficiency and symptoms not improving despite infusions - what is wrong with me?,"Hi, 

At around April last year I got my bloods done and discovered my ferritin was at 4ug/L, which resulted in me receiving an iron infusion. this year i got my bloods done again as my symptoms never improved. My ferritin was around 30ug/L this time around, so i got another infusion in October - this time with more iron. I think its ferinject. After that, I got my bloods done again recently as my symptoms still have not improved. Still waiting on results.

Throughout all of last year and this year I have constantly been fatigued. I cant even get out of bed most of the time, and it makes it really difficult to function. last year i was in year 12 and i would get very painful headaches daily. These headaches were typically worse when i was exposed to certain lighting in class. I am at university now and the headaches still have not stopped. for reference i am 19 years old. I also experience dizziness quite often at random times throughout the day, in addition to experiencing it when moving my head too fast. I also experience muscle aches, and generally just find myself feeling really shit. I also have trouble sleeping. Most nights it takes me hours to fall asleep. Not because my mind is restless and anxious - my mind is exhausted and empty, i simply just cannot fall asleep. My main concern is the fatigue though. I have so much to do and study, but i am just so fucking exhausted. I cant stop crying from the exhaustion. Not sad - just tired. I cant even walk around without feeling like i need to sit down and have a nap. My skin is also weirdly itchy. No marks like dermatitis - just itchy. Gets worse if i sit on different textiles. also bloat really easy, obsessive anxiety, get brain fog sometimes, and shortness of breath whenever i work out/walk/run. 

  
in terms of my diet and lifestyle habits: i eat a really varied diet. I eat red meat and fish regularly and also consume foods rich with vit C. Also started taking folate tablets. I try to wake up at 5:40 every morning and be in bed by 9pm, which involves me reading before bed to try and calm my mind in hopes of helping me sleep. I also do not drink coffee and instead drink matcha regularly - starting this year. i do not drink any caffeine in the afternoon. 

  
For some background:  
19 year old female  
been consistently taking a low dose of isotretinoin (accutane)  
on micronelle pill 150/30 (BC)  
diagnosed PCOS and assumed endometriosis by doctors (have not gotten laparoscopy to be sure)  
hypothyroidism has been running in the family for three known generations  
endometriosis runs in family also. 

Initially the low iron was a result of constant heavy menstrual bleeding that would occur for extended times outside of usual cycle. This has since been rectified as I have been on the pill since early last year. No clue what is causing this iron deficiency, or if it is indicative of a different problem.   
  
So far bloods have not shown anything abnormal except for my ferritin. My THS levels are normal but doctors are refusing to still test my T3 and T4 - even though this was what happened to my dad (normal THS and abnormal T3 T4). He has diagnosed hypothyroidism. Doctor also advised me to try meditation..? Obviously is that worked i would have tried a long time ago. And melatonin, for which she did not end up providing a prescription for? (In Australia prescription required for under 55 years). Also advised me to try some other bs thing that I cant remember. 

On the bloods i recently got done I am waiting for results from also testing ESR (i think its that one - something that measures inflammation to test for autoimmune). 

I really just want to find out what's wrong with me so i can function like a normal 19 year old. I really, really appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read this. Thank you.",1,1765241862.0,Anemic,0,1.0,False
1phtxtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1phtxtk/chat_gpt_told_me_what_i_couldnt_tell_myself/,Chat GPT told me what I couldn't tell myself,"Almost a year ago I met my LO. He was a medical provider to one of my kids - a one-off encounter, no ongoing care. Within a month I was completely obsessed with him. Out of the blue I ran into him in a coffee shop and he came over and hugged me.  

Of course, I told my myself that he was secretly yearning for me too (despite our respective spouses and kids) and about a week later I called him, told him how I felt about him and gave him my number. Which - obviously - he never called. I told him I wouldn't contact him again, and I didn't.

I've spent nearly a year convincing myself that there was something between us and that if he were not bound by professional constraints he'd have called. (No idea what I thought his opinion was about our respective marriages.) Despite intermittent periods of no-contact I'm finding myself spiraling again - gazing at social media photos and replaying our short encounters. 

Apropos of nothing, I typed into Chat GPT a brief summary of our interactions and the Chat GPT robot was like a kind but firm friend. This is the most likely meaning: nothing. It's so ridiculous, but it felt like a slap in the face. Literally, I colored. All of this maladaptive daydreaming, fantasies about hotel trysts, being perfectly made up at all times just in case I ran into him ... made up nonsense. Kidding myself this whole time.

I'm not sure what I'm hoping for with this post; just some understanding I suppose, from people who get it.

1phtwaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Webnovel/comments/1phtwaj/the_webnovel_funnel/,The Webnovel Funnel,"(Gave a guy some advice on how to boost his views on Webnovel and someone said I should make that comment it's own post so here it is.)


I see. Let me teach you what I've learned since I had no one to teach me what get views and I had to learn the hard way. From what I've seen and experienced on Webnovel is that getting readers is a funnel.




First is the cover and title, if the reader likes these then they click on the story. 




Title: The most successful titles on Webnovel  use strong trope keywords (like System, Villain, Regressed, or Cultivation) and usually have titles that tell you the premise of the novel in one line so the reader can figure out if it's something they'd be interested in since most of them would scroll past if they're unsure. It should act sort of like mini synopsis e.g Raising my Trash Ability into a Broken SSS Rank Skill.




That title although it may seem garbage is actually kinda genius and fits Webnovel perfectly because it does 3 important things 




1) It makes the reader curious ""Why does he have a trash ability and how will he go about raising it and making it stronger?"" 




2) The raising in the title imply that the MC will get stronger which is what Webnovel readers love.




3) it's a twist on the typical webnovel but at the same time similar enough. Where the MC would get the SSS ability out of the gate, this guy has to raise him trash skill to that level but the end result of both of these is the MC having a SSS class skill.



Sometimes conversational or dramatic phrasing with shock titles filled with emotion work. Titles that start with things like “Why did..."", “I Just…”, “How Did I Become…?”,""I'm not..."", “I Will Become…”, “I Just…,” “X is x, So Why…” will sometimes work but it's kinda an old strat compared to what I said before. 



An example would be ""I'm really not the Demon God's Lackey!"". But remember, above all else, Webnovel titles prioritize clarity and directness over any kind poetic wording with deep meaning so including SEO-friendly terms that boost visibility and reader engagement is a must.



Cover: Most successful stories on Webnovel have a attractive woman or a cool looking guy on the cover and the stories name in big, stylized, beautiful and bright colored text that catches the readers eye and the background is usually either plain (easier but worse) or blurry outline suggesting a more detailed background/a distant background (more effort but better) and the main color is either white, red, blue or purple as it is both eye-catching yet easily contrasts with the text. Sometimes pink is used if it's r18 and green is kinda rising for novels about immortality or plant magic. 



If they click on that then they reach the second stage, the synopsis: A good synopsis must have a clear hook in the first couple of sentences. Readers will most likely skim so if the core premise isn’t obvious immediately, they bounce. The first lines should instantly answer: What is the MC’s situation, and why is it interesting?



You should also immediately signal whatever relevant tropes you have in your novel right away because most Webnovel readers are looking to read certain tropes and not about deep themes so don't go waxing philosophics.


Avoid:

long walls of text


overly flowery writing


complicated lore dumps


vague philosophical statements




Also make sure the readers know the MC's role like if he is a underdog, side character, villain, or genius and make sure the readers know the MC will be/get stronger. Also make sure the conflict in the story (or at least the first part) is obvious in your synopsis. Make sure they know: What the MC up against, what danger, enemy, or consequence drives the story and what the MC stands to lose.




If they're interested in your novel then they move on to clicking your story and the third checkpoint: your first paragraph.  This is where the typical advice you hear about first lines come in. Take all the advice you've heard about a great first line and apply it to your first paragraph. 




The reason I say first paragraph is that most readers will end up skimming it and not only reading the first line so make sure it grabs attention. You can and should still start with a good first line e g ""In the beginning, the universe was created. This has angered many people and is widely regarded as a bad move."" Is widely regarded as the greatest first line of all time and for a good reason. It instantly makes you want to read the rest of the novel.




Here is a good first paragraph from Shadow Slave. ""A frail-looking young man with pale skin and dark circles under his eyes was sitting on a rusty bench across from the police station. He was cradling a cup of coffee in his hands — not the cheap synthetic type slum rats like him had access to, but the real deal. This cup of plant-based coffee, usually available only to higher rank citizens, had cost most of his savings.""




As you can see, the first line is weak but the last line of the paragraph is what grabs attention and make the reader read to find out more. ""Why did this guy have to spend his life savings on coffee and why is something as simple as coffee considered a luxury?""




Once the reader decides to continue reading, it's onto the next one. The first chapter: this one is simple. With the reader continuing to read the rest of your first chapter they'll likely finish it since it will be anywhere between 1000 - 1600 words, which is chump change to a Webnovel reader. 



But it isn't a guarantee that they'll continue reading after that so you'll have a plot twist/reveal/cliffhanger. Frequent one's include the MC being reborn at the end of the first chapter, the MC getting a system or some other hax at the end of the first chapter, MC getting betrayed etc




(Chapters over 1600 are a liability because it slows your upload speed and Webnovel readers love frequently updated novels. Based on my personal experience and experience of other authors I know, most readers would prefer a novel with chapters barely over 1000 words that updates frequently than one with 1500 or more that updates once a day or slower. Not saying you should kill yourself to upload twice a day or even once a day, I just want you to keep in mind that most Webnovel readers prefer more frequent updates than more content per update.)




Next are the first three chapters: you should have introduced and explained the MC golden finger within these chapters and introduced a very simple and easy to wrap up conflict e.g a arrogant young master who bullied the previous owner of MC body or the person the MC transmigrated as is about to be kicked out of the family or MC is trying to get into a special school.




First twelve chapters: you should have wrapped up w the easy conflict from the first three chapters (you are using this small insignificant conflict to have the readers continue your story and being introduced to your world. You should have your world introduced to them at this point so you should wrap up the conflict to give the reader a sense of satisfaction so they continue reading). 




E.g the MC kills the bully. He can also just humiliate the bully if you want to use the bully for some more conflict later on. Or MC proves he deserves to stay in the family, at least for now Or MC gets into the special school he wanted.




 If less than 50% of what I've said applies to you then something is wrong with your funnel and that's why your views low.

The amount of static and retention that occurs when grinding coffee is insane up to the point where I have to dose 1-2g higher because of it. I also have to brush off the inside of the grinder after every espresso shot. Is this normal? I clean the static pins on the grinder around twice per week and more depending on if it sticks. Additionally there are sometimes where the ground coffee “sprays” over my counter (see pic) and I have no idea why since it never used to do this. 

The grinder worked perfectly with no issues regarding static for about 3 months, then I started to notice it clogged up because of retained grounds and started to have to clean it either every use.

1phtrb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1phtrb4/mf_dying_stars/,[MF] Dying Stars,"Charles “Charlie” Newman awakes from a cold sweat and the next thing he knows he is striding confidently to the dumpster outside his apartment. It’s 2 AM in western Indiana. 15° with a windchill that the man on the tv says makes it feel like 0. His computer is now the only thing asleep in his apartment. His feet, covered in socks and flip flops, crunch the dusting of snow that came hours before. It is the only audible sound. 

Tonight, he wants to smoke. His addiction rages. It doesn't matter which addiction, it’s all the same, isn't it? Something he thinks he can’t live without: alcohol, drugs, coffee, food, women, or just the adrenaline he feels doing something wrong. They are interchangeable ways to ruin his life, and he loves and hates them all equally. 

Charles walks to the dumpster not to place something in it, but to grab the bag he placed the night before. Still there, still tightly tied. The odor of the premium bud inside radiates throughout the dumpster, almost making him wish the entire thing would catch fire. That would solve his problem, he thinks, and smell amazing. It does not matter to him that this bag is buried under the rest of his complex’s trash. What is a bag of litter from Doris in 4B compared to the rush of the new strain he just got. 35% THC, and .09% CBD, a hybrid grown 3 hours away in Michigan and sold for pennies on the dollar compared to what he can get at home. 

Last night when he tossed this, he was out of his mind. He wasn’t thinking straight. He just smoked too much is all. He doesn’t really want to quit getting high, not now. Not when she is in his head.

Now he knows better. Charlie fucking Newman is almost 40, he can contain anything and any feeling he wants. This time, he’s gonna smoke just enough to blur her face. 

Inside that bag is all of the drugs he has, his brand new one hitter, grinder, and the lighter he bought just for this occasion, all after the last time he threw it away. 

Each time he returns to the store, all new equipment is purchased. 

He wonders in these moments what the teenage salesman behind the desk at the headshop thinks of him. “Why is this dude back buying another grinder?” Or “hey boss, this guy must be selling this stuff somewhere else?” 

Some days he will go to a different store, just to avoid seeing the same person. 

Last time he won this  battle, two weeks ago, he simply forced himself to stay inside. A boring nine and half hours (his longest streak in months). With this came sleep that took forever to arrive but brought with it vivid dreams he would only see sober. Dreams with half understood visuals and enough context to make you wake with water in your eyes and a desire to no longer be alive. 

He didn’t smoke that night, and the next morning he awoke to hear the garbage truck taking away his vice. The sweet victory lasted hours, until the podcast he was listening to used her name and reminded him of his pain. So, he left work on his lunch break and headed to the dispensary. How common was her name exactly he wondered. This was called the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon he remembers. Like when your friend buys a silver Kia Sentra, a car you never considered before, and then all of the sudden every third car you see is a silver Kia Sentra. 

Charlie was always the only person he knew who could get stoned and cry, it was not however the party trick you think it was. The first time it happened, he blamed it on coughing too much. “That’s good shit man” he said to his dealer. A guy who he got along with just enough to buy weed before it was legal. A guy who loved talking about his turtles more than weed, and one who was just stoned enough to not notice the tears running down Charlie’s face were from an undisclosed pain, and not from “good shit”. 

It was no different this time. The first hit brings the euphoria, but it doesn’t last, and by the second and third hit, it’s too late. He wants to quit again. The phrases - Why am I smoking? and What am I doing with my life? were his mantra in these moments. It is then when Charlie talks himself into wanting to be sober, forgetting that by the morning he will miss the high, and her, again.  
The thoughts slip into obsession, and by then the train has already pulled away. Smoking, drinking, and the dancers he’d meet after dark offer only brief escapes before the noise in his mind rises again and everything else falls silent.
It’s 2:05 AM now and Charlie Newman’s one hitter is packed. He takes a hit, coughs it up, and begins to repeat the motions, hoping dreamless sleep follows. 
By 4 PM the following day, the bud is in his apartment dumpster, his grinder and one hitter are in the trash can of a neighboring gas station, and Charlie is sober again. For now.

I (F30) started working four years ago at a firm, exclusively for one of the senior partners (M38). Initially, our relationship was entirely professional and we had brief but cordial interactions, focused solely on the current projects. I was quickly appreciated for the quality of my work, my professionalism with clients and the fact that I consistently put in extra hours; it never bothered me because I really enjoy my work, and his mentorship has allowed me to greatly improve my skills.

After about a year, we began interacting in a more relaxed way, having coffee breaks and lunch together, joking more often and sharing innocent gossip about coworkers. I’m not sure how it started, as he’s not my type physically and I never intended for it to happen, nor did he ever give me the slightest sign that he was romantically interested in me. Yet, little by little, I had to admit to myself that I was becoming more and more attracted to him. I would catch myself thinking about him even when I wasn’t at work, smiling at his emails and phone calls, dreaming of him at night. 

In short, I had completely fallen for him. However, knowing that he had a long-term girlfriend and that they were living together, I tried to ignore it, focusing on the work and maintaining the same professional behavior, hoping that this crush would pass. Long story short, over two years have passed and I still feel the same way. I find it almost impossible to look him in the eyes. When he gets close I feel a knot in my chest and I desire him in a way I’ve never felt for anyone in my life.

I don’t want to act on these feelings. I don’t want him to realize how I feel, and I don’t want to interfere with his personal life. I respect his relationship and value our friendship, and I want to maintain a professional demeanor. But this situation is really weighing on me.

Currently, I’m the most prized member of his team. Over time, he has entrusted me with significant responsibilities and said many times that he values me both as a professional and as a friend. I’ve noticed that my feelings have slightly faded when we didn’t see each other during out time off. That’s when I started to realize that the only way to stop thinking about him would be to change jobs and stop seeing him altogether.

I’ve had interviews at other companies in my hometown, which went very well, and they’ve offered me a position, though it would be less stimulating professionally than what I’m doing now. I casually mentioned to him that I am considering a job change, lying about the reason, saying I wanted to move closer to my elderly parents. Although he seemed supportive and told me I should decide what’s best for my carreer, he has since been doing everything he can to convince me to stay, I was offered a promotion and given several projects with his own clients to manage independently.

I know that he is making every effort because he doesn't want to lose his most valued team member, not because he has fallen for me... but it hurts a lot seeing how much he cares about me, just not in the way I'd like to. I feel incredibly torn, because if I stay, I’ll have the opportunity to continue with a rewarding job mentored by a truly skilled professional, but that would mean continuing to suffer and struggling to move past my feelings for him. If I leave, it would be easier to forget about him, but I would be doing a less fulfilling (albeit well payed) job.

I found something worse.,"I’ve been a private investigator for twelve years, and most cases are exactly what you’d expect . Messy divorces, insurance claims, people who want proof of something they already suspect. When a woman hired me to follow her husband, I figured it would be another routine job. A few photos, a written report, maybe a court appearance if things got ugly.

But the first night I tailed him, something felt off. Not in the guilty way most cheaters act, no nervous texting, no detours to cheap hotels, no obvious double life. He moved with a kind of purpose I couldn’t figure out. Every turn he made seemed intentional. Every stop felt planned.

I didn’t know it at the time, but this wasn’t a cheating case. Not even close.

It all started when I received a voicemail. All I heard at first was shaky breathing, the kind someone makes when they’re trying not to cry.

Then a whisper.

“Please… I think my husband is cheating on me. I don’t know who else to call.”

There was a pause, five full seconds of dead silence before her voice cracked again.

“He’s been leaving at night. He says it’s work, but he doesn’t take his laptop anymore. And… he comes home different. Not tired. Excited. Like he enjoys whatever he’s doing. Please help me, I need to know what he is doing.”

She didn’t leave a name, but the number was there. I listened to it twice, then called back.

She picked up on the first ring.

“H–hello?”

“Hi. My name’s Alex. I’m a private investigator” I said. “You left me a voicemail a few minutes ago.”

“Oh. Oh my God, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to call this late, I just”

“It’s fine” I said. “I’m awake. Can you tell me your name?”

“Marissa” she said. “I’m… I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said all that on a message. I just didn’t know how to start.”

“Most people don’t” I told her. “Listen, this isn’t a conversation you want to have over the phone if you can help it. Are you comfortable meeting in person?”

“Somewhere public?” she asked. “I don’t want my husband to know.”

“Public is fine.“  I asked what the closest coffeeshop was and told her we could meet there.

She said quietly. “I can be there in the morning. I’ll tell him I’m going grocery shopping.”

We settled on 9:30 a.m. When I hung up, I saved her number and the voicemail, then stared at my phone for a long minute.

Most cheating cases start with anger. Rage. Betrayal. People spit venom when they talk about their spouses. Marissa didn’t sound angry.

She sounded afraid.

I tried to sleep, but my mind kept replaying her voice. The pauses. The way she emphasized the word excited, like it was the worst part. Affairs don’t energize people, they drain them. They make them reckless, sloppy, tired. But excitement? Excitement comes from purpose.

That was the first thing that bothered me.

By morning, I’d barely closed my eyes. I showered, dressed, and drove to the coffee shop she mentioned, a quiet, independently owned place tucked between a pharmacy and a thrift store. The kind of spot where people pretend to read books while eavesdropping on everyone else.

I got there early and took a booth in the back. Habit. I like walls behind me.

At exactly 9:29 a.m., the bell over the door chimed.

Marissa walked in.

She scanned the room like she expected someone to leap out of the shadows. Her eyes landed on me, and she hurried over, shoulders tight, movements small, like she was trying to take up as little space as possible.

“You came” she said, almost surprised.

“You asked” I replied. “Sit.”

She did, placing her purse on her lap, fingers locked around the strap. That grip told me more about her emotional state than anything she’d said so far.

A barista came by. Marissa ordered a tea she didn’t touch. I waited until we were alone again.

“Tell me what’s going on” I said.

She took a long breath, steadying herself.

“My husband. He works in logistics for a warehouse. For years everything was normal, long days, occasional overnight overtime, nothing strange. About six months ago, he started getting calls late at night.”

“What kind of calls?”

“I don’t know” she said. “He’d step outside, or into the garage. At first he’d talk. Lately… he just listens.”

“The night trips started soon after” she continued. “He leaves between eleven and one.”

“What does he take with him?” I asked.

“Keys. Sometimes a jacket. Never his laptop. Never anything from work. He comes back a few hours later and…” She hesitated. “He’s happy.”

Not relieved. Not nervous. Happy.

“He hums” she whispered, as if the word itself was obscene. “Like he’s proud of himself.”

Goosebumps crawled up her arms as she spoke. She rubbed them without realizing.

“Have you confronted him?”

“Once. I asked where he really goes. He smiled and said, ‘You don’t want to know. Work drama.’ Then he kissed my forehead and went to bed like nothing happened. I know he isn’t being called into work randomly.”

There was no tremor in her voice when she repeated those words. Just certainty. And fear.

“What do you want from me?” I asked.

She didn’t look confused. She didn’t hesitate. She didn’t flinch.

“I want to know what he’s doing” she said. “Whatever it is, I have to know.”

I slid a contract across the table. She signed without reading.

“Don’t confront him again” I told her. “Don’t change your behavior. Act like life is normal. I’ll handle the rest.”

She nodded, stood, and left without finishing her tea.

I waited a minute, then stood to go.

That night, when their garage door opened at 11:42 p.m., I was already parked a block away, lights off, camera ready, tracking him before his tires even hit the street.

I thought I was about to expose a cheater.

Instead, I was about to follow a man into the darkest hobby I’ve ever seen.

He didn’t take the highway, and he didn’t go anywhere near the industrial district Marissa mentioned. He drifted along backroads like someone following invisible directions, never signaling, never hesitating. Every time I thought I’d lost him, he’d reappear at the next intersection.

At 12:17 a.m., he turned into a storage facility. A fenced in patch of metal buildings on the edge of town. One flickering streetlamp buzzed overhead, illuminating rows of roll up doors. Nothing about the place screamed criminal. It was too normal. Too boring. And somehow, that made it worse.

He rolled down his window, punched a code into the keypad, and the gate slid open with a cheerful beep that didn’t match the dead silence of the night. No bags. No boxes. No laptop. Just keys and a casual stroll like he’d done this a hundred times before.

I waited thirty seconds, then slipped inside behind him. I killed my headlights, creeping down the center lane until I spotted him halfway down Row C, standing in front of a unit marked 109. His shoulders relaxed as he lifted the door.

That’s when I heard it.

Music.

Not loud. Not distorted. Just… wrong. Classical, slow, delicate, something that belonged in a candlelit ballroom, not a midnight storage unit. It floated into the air like perfume, soft and elegant, the kind of melody that makes you feel nostalgic for something you never experienced.

I stepped out of my car, heart hammering, and moved closer on foot. The music grew clearer with every step. And underneath it, came another sound.

A voice.

Muffled. Strained. Wet with fear.

“Please… please don’t…”

I froze.

Someone else was inside.

Not a recording. Not an echo.

A living, breathing person begging for something I couldn’t comprehend.

Then another voice answered, calm and low, almost tender like a parent soothing a child.

“Relax.”

After that one word was spoken I couldn’t hear much until there was a break in the music.

After a long moment of silence I heard him again. This time, no words.

He was humming. Humming along to the same classical tune drifting out of that metal box, perfectly in time, like the music wasn’t coming from speakers.

 The metal door began to rattle open.

I tucked away behind the closest corner and peered out.

He stepped out, locking the unit behind him with a casual turn of the key. No panic. No guilt. He didn’t even look around. He just slid the lock closed, pocketed the key, and strolled back to his car like a man leaving a gym after a good workout.

And as he walked away, he started humming again.

The same tune.

The same rhythm.

The same impossible calm.

Whatever was behind that door wasn’t his secret shame.

It was his favorite part of the night.

I watched him as he left. When his taillights finally disappeared, I forced myself out of hiding and crept toward the storage unit. Each step felt heavier than the last. I wasn’t sure what I expected to find, a clue, a lockbox, maybe just proof that the music hadn’t been in my head.

The metal door was shut tight, secured with an old padlock polished smooth by years of use. I stood there staring at it, my pulse thundering in my ears. I leaned closer, listening.

Nothing.

No music.
No voices.
No breathing.

Just silence.

Not the peaceful kind.
The kind that feels like something has already happened.

My hand brushed the lock before I realized what I was doing, fingers trembling as though opening it were a reflex instead of a decision. I tugged, testing it, trying to see if there was any give. The metal clanged louder than I meant, echoing through the rows of storage units like a shout.

That was when I came to my senses.

I wasn’t supposed to be investigating a crime scene. I was supposed to be observing a spouse. Somewhere along the line, the job had shifted and I hadn’t noticed until now.

I turned to leave.

He was standing right behind me.

No footsteps. No warning. Just there.

I barely had time to inhale before something bright flicked in his hand and pain tore across my cheek. The cut was shallow, but sharp enough to blind me with tears. I grabbed my face, stumbling back, staring at the blood slick on my fingers.

The knife was pristine. My blood was the only imperfection on its surface, glowing under the flickering streetlamp.

He lifted it up, examining the red smear like a jeweler assessing a diamond.

“If you’re going to do surveillance” he murmured, “you should really bring a weapon or something to protect yourself”

I couldn’t speak. Couldn’t breathe. He stepped closer, completely calm.

“My wife thinks I’m cheating” he said. “That’s cute. She knows something’s wrong, but she hasn’t figured out what.”

He tilted his head, studying my wound with clinical curiosity.

“You have no idea how valuable you are. A private investigator, sneaking around. No weapon, no backup, no alibi.”

He smiled then. It was confident.

He lowered the knife just enough for me to see the dark edge, stained with my blood.

“I don’t even have to touch you again” he said. “If something happens, this is enough. Your DNA, my lock, your prints. You look like a man trying to get inside somewhere he shouldn’t be.”

My stomach turned to ice.

“You understand what that means, right?”

It wasn’t a question.

I did.

He stepped back, folding the knife away like he was settling the bill at a restaurant. His voice dropped to a whisper I felt more than heard.

“You’re involved now. Whether you meant to be or not.” He smirked.

“Continue to report to my wife. Tell her you’re still investigating. When I need your help I’ll get in touch with you. Until then, take care of yourself and keep a low profile.”

He turned and walked toward his car, calm, humming the same soft classical melody I’d heard earlier, like all of this was simply part of his evening routine.

The gate beeped as he exited. The night went still.

My cheek burned. My hands shook. And for the first time since taking this job, I understood something with absolute clarity.

He didn’t just want me to follow him.

He wanted me on the record.",1,1765241330.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I was running on the road that went back to the park entrance, and I thanked God to see the lodge in sight.

The moon had come out, and I could better see around me, and when I tell you I ran towards that lodge, I ran. The adrenaline that had spiked in me was like never before, and I swear I could’ve run for a whole mile before even getting tired.

When I got back to the lodge, my body slammed into the lodge entrance doors because of how fast I was running, and the entire time I didn’t even think to look behind me.

When I touched the handle, I prayed to God the door wasn’t locked, which I guess He answered, because it wasn’t, and I flung the door open and entered the lodge.

It had a wide central room with only one other room that was separated by a wood door. The entrance doors had glass panels that let me see outside, and when I looked out them, I saw nothing.

I couldn’t decide whether to be relieved or scared that I didn’t see whatever was trying to get me. I looked at the door handle and saw it had a lock, which I immediately went to lock, and after that I began to think what I should do now.

“There’s gotta be a phone or something! Please God, let there be a phone!”

I went to the counter where there was a computer and a hand-dial phone on the wall.

I grew up in an old house, but I had no idea how to use it, so I ended up just pressing the numbers for 911, but nothing happened.

After that, I decided to check the room, and when I tried to open it, it was locked. I looked around to see if there was anything of use, but all I saw was a few benches near a park map that hung on the wall.

I tried to look for lamps or a light source, but it was so dark I had to use the moonlight shining in from the glass entrance door.

After looking around, I found nothing of use, but by then I was too scared to really move around. My head was fixed on the entrance door because I could see a fair amount of the parking lot, but if the moonlight got covered by clouds again, I’d be blind, so I decided to hide behind the counter that had a corner I could use to look at the entrance without exposing myself.

After at least thirty minutes passed, my body calmed down, but my thoughts didn’t.

I couldn’t believe what I’d seen, and it literally isn’t even my first day here.

That’s when I heard what sounded like a loud truck start to pull into the parking lot, and then its headlights shined brightly through the entrance doors.

I heard a door open and close and a voice yell out,

“Hello? Whoever’s in there, come out! I got a gun and I ain’t afraid to use it! I saw your car in the ditch, so if you’re hurt, yell to me!”

I was scared to speak. I was happy that I had someone near me, but… what about that thing? Is it still out there?

“I… I’m inside! Behind the counter! I ain’t got a weapon on me, but I’ve been attacked! Something I can’t even explain! It’s not safe out there!”

“If you can walk, come out where I can see you. I got a shotgun on me, so if anything does attack me, it’ll be dealt with!”

I contemplated trying to convince the man to come inside, but I realized I didn’t know if he was a cop, a ranger, or just a guy who saw my car in the ditch. And why would he have a gun?

“Alright, I’m coming out!”

I walked out from behind the counter, and I couldn’t see the man in great detail due to the bright shine from his truck. I saw his silhouette in it, and he didn’t look like that… thing, so I went to the doors and opened them.

“Are you a cop?”

“No, I’m a ranger, and I saw you crash on the cameras we have on the road. Now who the hell are you and why are you here?”

“I’m Lee. I was here to meet Thompson, but some stuff happened and I decided to sleep in my car and wait for morning.”

“If you spoke to Thompson, then you know we got a no loitering policy! What the hell were you thinking?”

The entire time he talked, I continued to look around the parking lot and to my left and right.

“What you looking for, son? If an animal been bothering you, then you crashing in that damn ditch would’ve scared it off.”

“It ain’t an animal that been bothering me, sir. I… I don’t even know what to call it.”

“Alright, I’ll tell you what. I’ll take you to a ranger station, and we can wait there until Thompson gets here. If it’s true you’re the newest hire, I’ll let Thompson handle you.”

“Okay, sounds good to me.”

I was relaxed to finally have another person near me, and to find out we were going somewhere that was safe, I was happy to go with the ranger.

“But before we do that, I gotta get your car outta the ditch, ’cause I ain’t gonna get fired for not cleaning that up.”

“Sir, I don’t think we should. What if what was attacking me comes back?”

“It’ll be fine. Just help me get your car connected to my cable, and we’ll drive it into the parking lot. Later we can call a mechanic to drag it out of here.”

I was terrified to go back to my car, but I didn’t really have a choice.

We got in his truck and began to go to the ditch my car crashed in, and when we got there, I saw the trunk door still open from when that thing forced it open.

My high beams had turned off by the time we got there, and we both got out, and he began to grab the cable from his truck bumper and slid down the ditch to connect it to my car.

“How long should this take?” I asked sheepishly.

“It may go faster if you help me.”

I nodded and also slid down the ditch, and I looked behind and around me the second I did.

He got the cable hooked onto my car and told me to close the trunk and driver door.

“How come the trunk is open?”

“I, uh… I don’t know.”

I tried to close it but saw the metal near the trunk handle was bent and unable to close.

“Hey, this won’t close.”

“Shit. Alright, close the driver door and get out of the ditch.”

I got over to the left side of the car and closed the driver door, and then climbed out of the ditch.

Me and the ranger got back into the truck, and he then began to reverse and pull my car out of the ditch. Slowly, my Jeep creeped out of the ditch and onto the road.

The ranger drove us in reverse back into the parking lot and put my car near the front parking spots of the lodge. After that, he began to turn to a small trail that looked to be used often.

“So, Lee, what happened that made you drive your car into a ditch?”

I thought about if I should try and explain the events, but by then I was so tired I didn’t want to attempt to tell what I saw.

“I saw eyes looking at me when I woke up. For some odd reason it scared the shit out of me, and I guess I panicked so hard I didn’t see the sharp turn.”

“I feel like what you saw was probably a deer that smelled some food in your car. It happened to me once and scared the hell outta me.”

I was annoyed with how all of what I saw was being chalked up to a deer looking for food.

“I guess… if I can ask, what’s your name?”

“My name is Arthur, but I don’t know if you’ll be needing names, ’cause Thompson is a pretty relaxed guy, but this incident might be too much to look past.”

“I guess you’re right, but hey, might as well be optimistic, right?”

“Sure.”

The rest of the ride was quiet, somewhat awkward, because he was right.. this whole thing might have shot my chances at getting the job.

But as we drove, the woods became thicker and thicker until the moonlight was blocked by the thickness of the trees.

It felt eerie, not in the paranormal sense, but it felt… sinister to be here, and especially after this night. I had my suspicions about this place, but a part of me just didn’t want to think about it.

After a while, we ended up at the ranger station, and it wasn’t as I pictured.

It wasn’t a nice warm lodge but a tall, half-steel, half-wood fire tower. I noticed its support beams looked reinforced with extra bolts and metal that dug into the ground.

“What’s with the support beams? Is this thing old or something?”

“Yeah, something like that,” he said with an exhausted tone.

He pulled into a dirt marked spot where it looked like he’d parked here many times before.

He turned off the truck, and we both got out. 

the tower had these big industrial grade lights that lit up the entire area around the tower.

The staircase that wrapped around the beams of the tower was shell cased by a chain link fence up until the walkway on top of the tower.

Near the tower was a maintenance shed and an outdoor bathroom.

“What’s the fence for? How come it covers the entire staircase?”

“Bears.”

“Really? I mean, I get near the bottom of the staircase, but all the way to the top seems a little excessive, no?”

“Chances aren’t taken here. If there’s a risk, there’s a fix.”

I guess that made sense to me, but we walked up to the staircase and started walking up them.

It wasn’t long before we got high enough above the trees that you could see things like mountains and open areas of the park.

“That’s beautiful!”

“Yeah… it’s one of the best things about this place.”

We got up to the walkway that circled around the lookout cabin, and Arthur opened the door to get inside.

It was a cozy place. It had a small furnace, kitchen area, a bunk bed for two people, but what caught my attention was a big steel gun case that was as tall as me.

You could see inside a few bolt-action rifles, but also a few handguns at the bottom of it.

But after seeing that, the cabin looked pretty normal, if not completely lived in.

“Arthur, how long have you worked here?”

“Bout 8 years.”

“Shit, really? Have the other rangers been here that long?”

“A few… but usually people quit after a year or two.”

He sounded remorseful before saying “quit.”

“What makes them quit?”

“What’s it matter to you, boy? You better get some rest, because if you don’t get the job, you’ll be driving a long way back.”

It caught me off guard with how he responded, but I wouldn’t be happy either if someone crashed in a ditch and needed saving.

“I suppose you’re right… which bunk should I take?”

“I don’t care, just take one.”

I got into the top bunk, and when I laid down, I had a great view of the park, and I saw multiple other towers with those same high-beam lights, but I quickly closed my eyes and started to get to sleep.

I was woken up by the sun glaring in my eyes and the smell of bacon.

“Hey Lee, you awake yet? I got breakfast.”

“Yeah, I am…”

I hopped down from the top bunk and walked over to the small kitchen area.

Arthur had cooked about a whole plate of bacon and a pot of coffee.

“Eat up, cause we gotta head to the park entrance soon to meet Thompson.”

“Alright.”

After a few minutes of eating, Arthur started to put on his olive green coat that had “RANGER” on the back of it.

I hadn’t noticed what he was wearing or even what he really looked like.

I didn’t know what his hair looked like because he had a hat that had the name of the park on it, but he had a recently but visibly shaved beard.

He was wearing bright blue denim jeans and a pair of boots that looked used and dirtied up.

“Alright, let’s get a move on,” he said.

We headed out the door, and it was a frosty morning. I put on my coat when we got to the bottom of the stairs and then got into his truck.

He started it, and we drove off onto the same trail that we used last night.

The forest didn’t seem as dense as it did last night… it felt more free and less claustrophobic. It may have been the fear and stress of what happened last night, but I didn’t pay it much mind.

When we got back to the parking lot, I saw my car still in its damaged state with the trunk still open.

“When will a mechanic get here?”

“Hadn’t called one yet.”

I was frustrated with his response but saw no point in fussing about it. I’d already caused enough trouble.

When we parked and got out of the truck, I saw a new car that wasn’t here last night. I assumed it was Mr. Thompson’s, and I was right, as I saw him inside the lodge standing behind the counter through the front doors.

“So, should I go in, or are you coming?”

“I’m comin’,” Arthur said begrudgingly.

We walked into the lodge, but it wasn’t a new place to me now. I had less than happy thoughts about this lodge, but I kept going into the lodge.

“Hello! Are you Mr. Lee?”

“Yes, sir! Mr. Thompson, I presume?”

“You’d be correct. And I see you’re with Arthur.”

“Yes, sir. Arthur practically saved my life last night, Mr. Thompson.”

“Please, call me Tom! But is that true, Arthur?”

“Yes sir, it is. He en—”

Thompson interrupted him mid-sentence.

“Ended up crashing in the ditch? Yeah, I saw,” he said with an optimistic tone and a grin on his face.

“Oh, yeah… I’m sorry about that, Mr. Tom. There was some animal that scared the Jesus out of me, and I freaked out more than I should have.”

I felt like I was lying to myself, but I realized I hadn’t thought about what I saw since… now?

“It’s fine, Mr. Lee! We all have made dumb mistakes, and I ain’t one to judge! But enough about that, how about we talk about orientation so you can become an official ranger?”

“Sounds great, sir. I’m ready to begin whenever!”

I was surprised how little he was concerned about me literally crashing in a ditch, but I didn’t really have a problem with it either.

He pulled out a ring of keys and headed toward the wooden door that I tried to open last night, and I saw him start unlocking it.

“This here is our orientation room for new rangers. All you gotta do is watch the training video, and then we’ll go about showing you around the park!”

I walked into the room, and Tom pulled out this old VHS TV and grabbed a singular VHS and put it in and pressed play.

“Alright, come on out when it’s done, and I’ll give you a ride around the park!”

“Alright,” I said nervously.

The video started with this chime that immediately made it sound from the early 90s, and then a voice spoke from the TV.

“Hello! If you’re watching this, then you’re our soon to be newest ranger or rangers! Here I’ll be covering some basic things about this here park!

WoodKnock National Park was founded in 1923 and has been open ever since! And as a ranger, you’ll try to keep that streak going! Here you’ll be taking care of duties that involve:

Keeping wildlife regulated, keeping campers from wandering off approved trails and or campgrounds, and most importantly of all, making sure that the southwestern area of the park remains completely empty and untraveled, as that area is known for dangerous wildlife, and only permitted rangers or government employees are allowed to enter that area!”

The TV showed a picture of the park that outlined the prohibited area with a red line.

“And another note! If you see government officials entering the park, you are not to interact with them in any way! Doing so will end in immediate termination.”

It was weird hearing about “government officials” going into this unknown and “dangerous” part of the park, but the TV continued.

“The southwestern area of the park is home to a very endangered species, and EXTREME care is taken to make sure no poachers or jumpy rangers risk extinction of this animal.

“Moving on! Here is a list of code words that mean different kinds of situations! Most important of them being!”

It showed a picture of a list of words that were:

“Fallen Bark”

“Broken Fence”

“Leaf Fall”

It didn’t state what these meant, but the man continued on.

“These code words will be taught to you either in person or by a pamphlet given by the current park manager.”

“Well that’s it for now! We hope your time as a ranger is both a fun and learning experience! If you have any questions please ask the nearest veteran ranger or the park manager.

Thank you for choosing KnockWood Park!”

The VHS ended and I stood up to leave the room, then exited into the hall.

“All done, Lee?”

“Yes sir.”

“Alright then! Let’s head out!”

Before we even started walking, Thompson’s radio crackled and a voice called his name.

“Tom? Tom! Ya come in? We got a Fallen Leaf at campground 7!”

“One moment, Lee. This’ll just take a second.”

Thompson stepped over to the counter, but I could still hear the conversation.

“What do you mean, Robin? There’s no way it happened twice in the same week. This is beginning to get costly!”

“I don’t know what to say, boss, but I’m looking at a-”

Tom cut them off before they could finish.

“I’ll come over in a minute… but I can’t talk here.”

“Understood.”

The radio beeped and went quiet.

“Well, I’m sorry, Lee, but I’m afraid Arthur here will have to take you. I have another… thing I have to handle, so if you don’t mind.”

Before I could respond, he rushed out through the entrance doors.

“Well, Lee, looks like you got me,” Arthur said.

“I guess. What now?”

“Well, I ain’t got the time to drive around, since I’ve got some duties to attend to. But you can come with me and get some experience out in the field.”

“I got a choice?”

“Nope.”

“Then I guess yeah, let’s go.”

On our seventh anniversary, Dashiell and I decided to tattoo each other's names on our chests.


When I groggily woke up after the session, I looked down—


\[SLUT NO.1\] was burned into my skin.


The tattoo artist, Sloane, covered her mouth with her hand, giggling.


""This tattoo suits you perfectly!""


I grabbed the cup beside me and hurled it at the floor.


Glass shards exploded toward her.


In a flash, Dashiell threw himself in front of Sloane, shielding her completely.


""Sloane's young! It was just a joke. You're seriously losing it over this?""


My eyes locked onto Dashiell's open collar.


Where my name should have been, ""Sloane Fairmont"" was clearly branded on his skin.


Sloane peeked out from behind him, sticking out her tongue, her voice dripping with fake sweetness.


""Dash said my name was pretty last time.""


""I was just kidding around. You're not actually pressed about this... are you?""


...


My face went cold.


Before I could say anything, Dashiell's friends strolled in, all smiles.


""Man, you and Thalia are still going strong, huh?""


""Obviously. Remember when Dash proposed? Dude bought like a hundred thousand roses and turned that whole estate into a freaking rose garden.""


""Seven years married and you're still getting matching tattoos? Dash, you're such a romantic.""


""Wait, what'd you guys even get?""


Mid-sentence, their eyes landed on my exposed collarbone.


The laughter died instantly.


Their smiles froze. Eyes went wide.


The entire room fell into dead silence.


Only Sloane let out a soft laugh.


Dashiell frowned, pulling Sloane behind him.


""Sloane. Apologize.""


She rolled her eyes and tossed out the words like they physically pained her.


""Sorry. Happy?""


She glanced at me and rolled her eyes again, muttering under her breath, ""It was just a joke. Why's she being so extra?""


""Old bitch needs to chill.""


Dashiell gave her shoulder a gentle squeeze.


Then turned to me with that calm, reasonable look he always wears when he's about to gaslight me.


""Sloane knows she messed up. Just let it go.""


""She's only twenty. She doesn't have a filter yet. That's how kids are.""


""You've always been mature about stuff like this. Don't make this a thing.""


Every word was a soft knife wrapped in velvet.


Dashiell just stood there, playing peacemaker while openly taking her side.


I almost laughed at how absurd it all was.


""An apology?""


""I'm not accepting it.""


I slowly pulled my collar closed, covering those humiliating words.


My nails dug into my palms.


It hurt.


But not even a fraction as much as the pain tearing through my heart.


I looked Dashiell straight in the eye.


""Since you clearly can't handle this.""


""I'll deal with it myself.""


With that, I turned and walked out.


As the door clicked shut behind me, I heard muffled voices inside.


""Did you see the look on Thalia's face? Legit got chills. She's a Hartwell—been spoiled rotten her whole life. There's no way she's letting this slide.""


Someone else chimed in hesitantly: ""Thalia's not the forgiving type. This isn't over.""


Then came Dashiell's voice, calm and assured.


""She won't do anything. I know her. She's just upset. She'd never actually hurt Sloane.""


He paused, then added, ""Besides, I'll protect her. Thalia can't touch her.""


One of them quickly played along: ""Of course. Sloane's the one you actually care about now.""


I stood outside the door, let out a cold smile.


'Won't do anything?'


Then I wouldn't be a Hartwell.


I slid into my car and made a call:


""Midnight tonight.""


""Bring Sloane Fairmont to me.""


""And have the skin graft equipment and medical team on standby.""


Chapter 2


Just before eleven, my phone lit up.


A message from my brother.


\[Security's bringing Sloane over. She'll be at the estate in twenty.\]


Before I could reply, my friend sent me a video.


I tapped play.


Sloane's face filled the screen, grinning ear to ear.


""So today I gave a special design to some washed-up socialite hag.""


She waved her tattoo gun at the camera.


""Wanna guess what I gave her? 'SLUT NO.1!'""


""You should've seen her face. She's like thirty-something and still wearing low-cut tops.""


""God, her skin was so loose the needle barely held. I went over it three times on purpose. That shit's permanent now! Hahaha!""


The comments exploded with ""queen behavior"" and ""icon energy"" and strings of laughing emojis.


Sloane's smugness only grew.


""I've seen women like her a million times. They throw daddy's money around, sip fancy lattes at Bluestone Lane, and chase after rich guys. Not like me—I built my own business at twenty with my own two hands.""


She sighed dramatically.


""But no matter how hard old hags try, they're still just... old. Even their husbands don't want them anymore.""


""Next time I'll go live on TikTok and show you how I teach gold-digging parasites a real lesson.""


The video ended.


I actually laughed.


Sloane Fairmont, you've got some nerve.


Slut. Old hag. Parasite.


When she was throwing those labels at me, did she ever think about what her own name used to be?


""Trash.""


That's what she was called before I saved her.


Five years ago, I went to rural Georgia for a charity education project. Found her in a shack with a leaking roof.


She was sixteen. Curled up on a straw mat, covered in bruises.


Her face was gaunt and sallow. Her body was frail. Her eyes carried shame and despair she couldn't hide.


She grabbed my sleeve, ""Miss, please help me. Take me with you...""


That same day, I brought her back to New York.


Took her in as my sister and changed her name to Sloane Fairmont.


She'd suffered? I gave her the best life money could buy.


She wanted an education? I sent her to Parsons.


She wanted to start a business? I invested without blinking and showed up in person to cut the ribbon at her tattoo studio's grand opening.


And now?


She used the skills I paid for to carve those words into my chest.


To humiliate me online.


And worse—she set her sights on my husband.


But what shocked me most?


Dashiell was protecting her.


A loud commotion snapped me out of my thoughts.


Dozens of security guards in black suits filed in, moving in perfect formation.


Two of them dragged Sloane forward and dumped her on the floor.


Like trash.


Like her past.


She struggled to lift her head, eyes blazing with fury.


""Thalia! All you know how to do is use your family's money to bully people. What else are you good for?!""


Then something seemed to occur to her.


She sneered.


""When Dash finds out what you did, he's gonna lose his shit!""


""And once he dumps you, you really think the Hartwells will want a daughter the Wilsons threw away? You'll be nothing!""


I looked down at her and smiled.


""When Dashiell was chasing after me, he didn't even know I was a Hartwell.""


Her smile froze.


I crouched down, tilting her chin up with one finger.


""You're right about ONE thing.""


""You're twenty. Young. Skin's tight and smooth... Perfect for covering up this ugly tattoo on my chest.""


Her pupils instantly dilated in terror.


""What do you...""


""As for using my family's money...""


I cut her off, let go, accepting a sterilized towel from my butler, and carefully wiping my hands.


""You've got it wrong.""


""In New York, I AM THE MONEY.""


Chapter 3


The surgical lights flared to life.


The sharp sting of disinfectant hit me like a slap.


Suddenly, I saw eighteen-year-old Dashiell as clearly as if he were standing in front of me.


He always sat in the front row, spine rigid, posture perfect.


His collar was so worn the threads were coming loose.


Once, he missed three days of class with a fever.


I tracked him down to a construction site in Queens.


He was hauling bags of cement in the July heat.


I stuffed five grand in cash into his backpack when he wasn't looking.


But he chased me down three blocks to return it, voice cracking:


""Take it back. Please... I need my dignity.""


So, after that, I just ""happened"" to bring an extra breakfast. ""Accidentally"" lent him my notes.


Then came the first snow.


I don't know how he found out my apartment address, but he just stood under the streetlight waiting until I went back past midnight.


""Dashiell...""


He pulled two cups of hot chocolate from inside his jacket—still warm—and handed them to me.


The first thing he said wasn't an explanation for why he came.


He just asked: ""Thalia, can you wait for me?""


The wind whipped snow into my eyes, making tears spill down my cheeks.


""Of course.""


Years later, he built his company from nothing. Took it public.


That night, he held me so tightly, voice breaking.


""Those years I only slept three hours a night.""


""I was terrified I'd never catch up to you. That you'd realize I had to save for a week just to buy you a damn coffee.""


I wrapped my arms around him, holding him like he was a child who needed comfort.


""Yes, you did it.""


Then came the day he met my parents.


He walked into our living room and saw my father.


That's when he realized who I really was.


That night Dashiell told me:


""Everything I've killed myself for doesn't even touch where you started.""


But that didn't break him.


If anything, it fired him up even more.


He became a total workaholic—absolutely relentless.


He threw himself into deals, into projects, burned himself out to claw his way into New York's elite circles.


Then he proposed with nearly a hundred thousand roses covering an entire private estate.


What did he say back then?


He said the only reason he existed was to become someone who deserved me.


The anesthesia started wearing off.


A dull ache pulsed in my chest.


Dashiell's love for me.


Grand and brilliant.


But too bad—it burned out fast.


Vows only sound good the second they leave your mouth.


A lifetime together couldn't even survive seven years.


""Miss Hartwell?""


I snapped my eyes open.


Wiped the tears.


""Mr. Wilson is back.""


I looked down at my chest. The skin had been perfectly replaced.


The new patch was slightly pink but smooth and flawless. Like nothing ever happened.


Dashiell walked in carrying shopping bags, his usual easy smile in place.


He set down a Tiffany bag and reached out to touch my face.


""Thalia, Sloane went too far today.""


""I got you a new necklace. Don't hold it against her, okay?""


The medical team had already left the estate.


Only a few security guards remained.


So, Dashiell didn't notice anything unusual.


He opened the jewelry box with a grin. The diamonds inside sparkled brilliantly.


""I promise I won't let Sloane act up again.""


When he mentioned Sloane, his tone went soft. Gentle. He didn't even realize it.


I stood still, just watching him.


The Dashiell Wilson in front of me now wore a Patek Philippe worth tens of millions.


That frayed collar from years ago had been replaced by one with custom mother-of-pearl buttons.


Even the scent clinging to him—gardenia—was identical to Sloane's perfume.


I looked at him in all his polished, expensive glory and suddenly remembered that snowy night when he was eighteen.


Standing in the snow in a cheap puffer jacket with loose threads...


""Thalia?""


When I didn't respond, he stepped closer.


The gardenia scent got stronger.


Sloane suddenly burst out, stumbling into Dashiell's arms.


""Dash!""


""She had people pin me down and literally cut the skin off my body!""


""You said you'd always protect me. It hurts so bad!""


Dashiell's breathing stopped.


He looked at the gauze on her chest, then at my smooth, unmarked skin.


His throat bobbed hard.


""Thalia, what... happened to you?""


""How did you become so cruel?""


Sloane sobbed softly in his arms.


But when she looked at me, her eyes sparkled with victory.


""She's so young. She's gonna have a scar for the rest of her life. What's she supposed to do now?""


His voice got harsher. ""She apologized! Did you have to destroy her to feel better?!""


I watched the way he shielded her.


And I thought of eighteen-year-old Dashiell.


He used to hold me so carefully, like I'd break if he squeezed too hard.


And he made his first vow—that he'd protect me for the rest of his life.


I forced down the bitter ache climbing up my throat.


""So, did you ever think about what I'm supposed to do with those words tattooed on my body?""


""SHE branded me. I took a piece of her skin. We're EVEN.""


Dashiell opened his mouth but said nothing.


Seeing him go silent, Sloane burrowed deeper into his arms and suddenly let out a shrill scream.


""Dash! I'm pregnant with your baby!""


""You can't let her treat me like this! Take me away! Please just take me away!!""

We often grow up with a romanticized view of love. Movies and novels tell us that once the right person comes along, everything falls into place effortlessly. But the reality of sharing a life with another person is far more complex. Even the strongest partnerships face periods of disconnect, frustration, and doubt.

Conflict isn't necessarily a sign that a relationship is failing. In fact, how a couple handles disagreement is often a better indicator of long-term success than how often they agree. Avoiding conflict entirely can lead to resentment, while constant fighting can erode trust. The middle ground—constructive navigation of challenges—is where healthy relationships thrive.

# Navigating the Most Common Relationship Roadblocks

https://preview.redd.it/cppwmnmrr26g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d87d06e32fc53ad080988d2df388ab3b92cfa4d

Every couple is unique, but the issues that drive wedges between partners are remarkably consistent. Identifying these patterns helps you realize you aren't alone and that these problems are solvable.

# 1. Communication Breakdowns

Communication is the lifeline of any relationship, yet it is often the first thing to deteriorate during stressful times. This doesn't just mean arguing; it includes the silent treatment, passive-aggressive comments, or simply ""talking past"" one another.

One common pitfall is the ""pursuer-distancer"" dynamic. One partner seeks resolution and connection (often perceived as nagging), while the other withdraws to avoid conflict (perceived as uncaring). This cycle creates a feedback loop of anxiety and isolation. Furthermore, many couples struggle with defensive listening—listening only to formulate a counter-argument rather than to understand their partner's perspective.

# 2. Financial Friction

Money is rarely just about math; it represents values, security, power, and freedom. It is consistently cited as one of the top reasons for divorce. Conflict often arises when a ""saver"" marries a ""spender,"" or when one partner feels they carry the bulk of the financial burden.

Hidden debt or secret purchases can shatter trust just as effectively as an emotional affair. Even in relationships with plenty of resources, disagreements about how to allocate funds—saving for a house versus traveling, for example—can cause deep rifts if compromised isn't reached.

# 3. The Intimacy Gap

Intimacy involves more than physical connection; it includes emotional closeness and vulnerability. Over time, the initial ""spark"" of a new relationship naturally settles into a more companionable love. However, if couples stop nurturing their romantic bond, they may begin to feel more like roommates than lovers.

Mismatched libidos are a frequent source of tension. One partner may feel rejected and unloved, while the other feels pressured and inadequate. Outside of the bedroom, a lack of non-sexual affection—holding hands, hugging, or sitting together—can lead to a sense of emotional drifting.

# 4. Trust and Jealousy

Trust is the foundation of safety in a relationship. While infidelity is the most obvious trust-breaker, small, consistent breaches can be just as damaging. Broken promises, white lies, or sharing private information with others can slowly erode the sense of security between partners.

In the digital age, social media has introduced new layers of jealousy and suspicion. ""Micro-cheating""—such as secretive messaging or engaging inappropriately with others online—has become a significant modern challenge. Rebuilding broken trust is possible, but it requires immense patience and transparency.

# 5. Balancing Life Responsibilities

External stressors often spill over into the relationship. The pressure of raising children, caring for aging parents, or managing demanding careers can leave partners with little energy for each other.

The division of labor in the household is a major flashpoint. If one partner feels they are managing the majority of the chores and the ""mental load"" (the planning and organizing of family life), resentment builds quickly. This imbalance often leads to burnout and a feeling of being taken for granted.

# Practical Steps to Strengthen Your Bond

https://preview.redd.it/f3xkhshtr26g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=62615eddd558b7104e5a938f653ef49d81c6694c

Recognizing the problems is only half the battle. To move forward, you need actionable tools to repair and strengthen the relationship. Here is how to turn conflict into connection.

# Master the Art of Active Listening

Most people listen with the intent to reply, not to understand. Active listening requires you to pause your internal monologue and focus entirely on your partner.

Try the ""mirroring"" technique. When your partner shares a grievance, repeat back what you heard in your own words before responding. For example, ""It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed because the house is messy when you get home, is that right?"" This validates their feelings and prevents misunderstandings. Additionally, replace ""you"" statements (""You never help out"") with ""I"" statements (""I feel exhausted when I have to do the dishes alone"").

# Establish Financial Transparency

Schedule regular ""money dates."" These are designated times to discuss the budget, upcoming expenses, and long-term goals without the pressure of an immediate crisis.

If your spending styles differ, create a ""yours, mine, and ours"" system. Maintain a joint account for household bills and shared goals, but keep separate meaningful amounts for personal spending. This allows for autonomy without risking the family's financial health.

# Prioritize Quality Time

In a busy schedule, the relationship often gets the leftover time—which is usually when you are most tired. You must be intentional about carving out space for each other.

This doesn't always require expensive date nights. It can be a 15-minute coffee ritual in the morning, a walk after dinner, or a ""no-phones"" rule after 9 PM. The goal is to engage in activities that are new or exciting, as novelty releases dopamine and mimics the early stages of falling in love.

# Show Appreciation Daily

Over time, we tend to stop noticing the good things our partners do. To combat resentment, actively look for things to appreciate.

Express gratitude for small things—taking out the trash, making dinner, or handling a difficult phone call. A culture of appreciation creates a ""positive sentiment override,"" meaning you give your partner the benefit of the doubt during disagreements because you feel generally valued and loved.

# Share the Load Fairly

Sit down and list out all household responsibilities, including the invisible mental load (like remembering birthdays or scheduling vet appointments). Be honest about who is doing what.

Rebalance the list based on time availability and preference. If one person cooks, the other cleans. If one handles the finances, the other manages the social calendar. Viewing the household as a shared business where both partners are equal stakeholders can reduce feelings of unfairness.

# Seek Professional Support

There is often a stigma attached to couples counseling, with many believing it is a last resort before a breakup. In reality, therapy is a maintenance tool. A neutral third party can help identify negative patterns you can't see yourselves and provide tools to break them. Going to therapy shows a commitment to the relationship's health, not a sign of its demise.

# Building a Partnership That Lasts

No relationship is static. It is a living thing that grows, changes, and reacts to the environment around it. The challenges of communication, money, intimacy, and stress are inevitable parts of sharing a life. The difference between couples who drift apart and those who grow closer lies in how they meet these challenges.

I don’t remember getting home.

I remember the paper on my kitchen table, the word CANDIDATE glaring up at me. I remember the pen beside it, right where I’d dropped it. I remember washing my hands three times even though there was nothing on them.

I didn’t turn any lights on.

Outside my window, the city went through its normal routine. People argued on sidewalks. A siren in the distance. A couple laughed too loudly as they passed by, drunk, alive and unaware of how easily those two things could separate.

I tried not to think about Eric in the trunk. Whether he was still there. 

You did that, the voice in my head said.

You wrote him into that trunk with your lies.

I pressed my palms into my eyes until colors bloomed behind them.

If I walked away, he would still keep hunting. Prospects, volunteers, whatever he wanted to call them. I wouldn’t stop it.

But now I knew something I hadn’t known before.

I could make it worse.

I could make it happen faster.

Or,

I could try to aim it.

The thought made me want to throw up.

Find someone who deserves it.

Who deserves it?

The drunk who got behind the wheel and drove home? The guy who screams at his girlfriend on the phone and grabs her arm too hard outside a bar? The landlord who ignores the mold in his tenants’ walls? The cop who cuts corners? 

I stood at the window and watched people pass under the streetlight, each of them a file I could open if I wanted to.

For twelve years, I’ve watched people from behind glass, behind lenses, behind legal language. I’ve always been able to tell myself I was neutral and in control.

My phone buzzed.

Unknown:
I’m patient, Alex. But not that patient.

Unknown:
The longer you wait, the more people I look at on my own.

The implication was clear.

Do nothing, and who knows how many end up like Eric.

Act, and at least I could tell myself I’d picked someone who… deserved something.


I picked up the pen.

Outside, on the corner, a man in a suit was yelling into his phone, one hand slicing the air. I’d seen him before, always cutting people off in traffic, always shoving past slower pedestrians. Last week I’d watched him grab a waitress’ wrist when she got his order wrong.

I watched him now, his face twisting, his voice rising, someone on the other end of the line absorbing his words because they had no choice.

I shouldn’t have thought it.

I did anyway.

What about him?

My grip tightened on the pen until it hurt.

The line on the page waited.

CANDIDATE:

I told myself I was just thinking.

Just watching.

Just doing what I always do.

But my hand still moved.

Slowly.

As if someone else were guiding it.

I wrote a name.

And the moment the ink dried, I understood the worst part of all of this.

He hadn’t forced me to.

He’d just given me a reason.

I stared at the word until it blurred. The room felt smaller, like the walls were inching closer one breath at a time. Eventually, I set the pen down and stepped back.

I should have torn it up.

I should have burned it.

Instead, I left it sitting there on the table like evidence at a crime scene.

My phone buzzed again.

This time, it wasn’t Unknown.

Marissa.

For a few seconds, I just watched the screen light up. My thumb hovered over the answer button and didn’t move.

The call went to voicemail.

A notification popped up. One new message.

I told myself not to listen. Not tonight. Not with that paper still drying on the table.

I pressed play anyway.

Her voice came through in a strained whisper, like she was calling from inside a church or a hospital.

“Alex… it’s me. I know you said you’d keep looking into him, I just…”

She took a shaky breath. I could hear something faint in the background. A TV, maybe.

“He’s been different again” she said. “Worse. He left last night and came back at three in the morning. No laptop. No work bag. He just walked in and..”

She broke off.

“He kissed my forehead and said, ‘Thank you for starting this.’ I don’t know what that means.”

My hand tightened around the phone.

“I asked him what he was talking about” she went on. “He just smiled and said, ‘You made the call. That’s all it ever takes.’”

There was a pause. I heard a soft, distant sound behind her. A melody, maybe. Barely there. My stomach flipped.

“And Alex…” her voice dropped, almost a whimper now, “he was humming again. That same song. The one I told you about at the coffee shop.”

Another pause. Longer this time.

“He said he’s… excited” she whispered. “He hasn’t used that word in days. Not like that. I don’t know what you’ve found, or if you’ve found anything.”

Her breathing hitched.

Silence.

When she spoke again, the fear in her voice was no longer just about her husband.

“Please call me back” she said. “I feel like something already started and I missed it.”

The message ended with a soft click.

For a long time, I just stood there in the dark, phone in one hand, the paper on the table in front of me.

I realized my jaw was clenched.

My shoulders were tight.

My throat hurt.

And under all of that, under the ringing in my ears and the pounding in my chest, there was something else.

A sound.

Quiet.

Steady.

Familiar.

It was coming from me.

I was humming.

I even ran in to his gaming room to brag I found his Christmas gift and he is going to love it. An all in one music box. This beautiful vintage looking jukebox that plays everything. Vinyls, cassettes, cds, even 8 tracks.  He has always talked about the one my mom has so I got him one. Even on sale it was $175. 

Well today I went to help my mom get her things in order.  She had a list of chores for me to do. I told my boyfriend he didn’t need to waste his day off to come over to my moms again. So he went thrifting without me. As I’m already my mom’s he text me telling me about his finds. And that we was going to Target to get a few things like coffee, creamer, a new spatula and look around a bit.  And he text me saying he found a turn table. He was so excited that he raced home to install it start using it. 

I told him before he left to remember Christmas is coming and we promised not to buy things for ourselves until after Christmas. “Remember me saying don't buy anything for yourself” was  my response to him. Didn’t see the problem because it wasn’t on his list anywhere.  No shit. That’s why I was so excited about thinking of something I know he is going to love. Finding a great gift that they didn’t think of asking for is the perfect gift and now I have to cancel the order and think of something else.

Hey!

I’m hoping to meet some new people who share similar interests or just enjoy good conversation. I’m an American girl with a cozy-but-witchy vibe — think books, gardening, crystals, curiosities, taxidermy, and horror movies. If there’s a farmers market, antique shop, or oddities booth in the area, chances are I’m wandering around it with a coffee in hand.

I love fostering animals (unrelated to my love of taxidermy), exploring local events, and connecting with people who appreciate a mix of earthy, spooky, and artsy energy.

Things I like/make me happy:

Donkeys 
Yellow houses 
The ocean 
Art museums 
Human anatomy/museums 
Mushrooms 
Halloween 
Jellyfish 
Tacos 
The smell of fresh laundry 
Golden retrievers 
Cows especially highland 
Friesian horses 
Dahlias

If any of that sounds like your vibe too, feel free to message me.

1phtdcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1phtdcu/since_becoming_an_adult_every_year_has_gotten_a/,"Since becoming an adult, every year has gotten a bit worse.","Here I am, not getting any sleep again. And it just hit me - every year since I became an adult, has sucked just a little bit more each time. 

First of all the positives: 

1) I successfully grinded to finish my master's degree 

2) I now have a well paying job, which I don't necessarily hate doing 

Now the negatives:

1) It sucks to be the only child and having to look your parents get older. It puts a weird sort of unconscious pressure on me, which doesn't allow me to just walk away as I don't have anyone to share the burden with.

2) In 4 years I had to witness 4 relatives and close  family friends die. And I had to help take care one of them, with them in the end literally dying between my hands.

3) The job, while well paying and not something I necessarily hate doing, is slowly killing me. I hate needing to get to work by 8 am. As much as I try, there's no morning person inside of me. And of course, all the pointless bureaucracy and the unexpected bouts of toxicity from either co-workers or my boss. Honestly, blue collar shift work paid less, but I had to think about work less, had more free time and there was a sense of camaraderie. 

4) The previous point brings me to the question of sleep. As I'm not a morning person, I feel like I'm almost always in a state of sleep deprivation. I can function, but it drains me. And with each year I feel like my sleep quality is getting worse and it's getting harder for me to fall asleep. 

5) I can't enjoy coffee, because it screws up my sleep even more.

6) I've realised that I haven't fulfilled any of my dreams and I've given up on dreaming. For the longest time I wanted to do a big trip around the world, but now I'm not even excited about it. I used to enjoy writing and reading as a hobby, but now my eyes are too tired due to work or I'm constantly distracted or lazy. I used to make music on my computer, but now I'm just too tired after work or can't be bothered on the weekends.

7) To make life suck just a little more, I've started balding really fast and have lost almost all my hair from the top in 2 years (coincidentally, it's been 3 years since I got my current job and during these past 2 years I also finish my degree). 

And I'm only 31. What's the point of this post, I don't even know. Maybe I'm hoping to hear some advice, but I don't know what questions to ask.

1pht8sy,https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyTab/comments/1pht8sy/galaxy_tab_a9_for_8_and_5_year_old/,Galaxy Tab A9+ for 8 and 5 year old?,"So… after **4–5 years of living with Fire tablets for kids**, I think it’s finally time to admit what we all know deep down:  
🔥 **Fire Tablets are basically the fruitcake of children’s tech** — sounded like a good idea at the time, but now they just sit there getting stale, slow, and slightly offensive.

After years of clunky performance and watching memory evaporate faster than cookies at a school holiday party, I’m ready to try something else.

We **massively lucked out** and grabbed **two Galaxy Tab A9+ tablets** during a holiday sale (cue jingle bells). We also already own an ancient **Tab A7**, which—somehow—still runs like it’s fueled by Christmas magic. So hopes are high. Spirits are bright. Sanity is hanging by a thread.

Before I officially retire the Fire tablets to the Island of Misfit Electronics, I’ve got a few questions—mostly rooted in **everything I disliked about Fire tablets**:

🎁 **Memory Madness**

* On Fire tablets, loading apps is basically like inviting too many people into an elevator: everything stops working. ➡️ With the **A9+ and expandable storage**, can apps be installed to the SD card, or is it *only* for media like videos, pictures, and files?

🎄 **Offline Sanity**

* If apps *can’t* live on the card, can video downloads within apps (looking at you, Disney+) be directed to the SD card? Because offline downloads are the difference between peaceful travel and public apologies.

🧑‍🎄 **Parental Control Wizardry**

* Can I lock this thing down like Fort Knox? ➡️ App approvals ➡️ Play Store restrictions ➡️ In-app purchase lockdown (Basically: prevent my kid from accidentally purchasing a $79.99 unicorn simulator.)

📧 **Email Shenanigans**

* When setting this up for kids, do they each need their own email address? Or can you make kid-specific accounts without tying everything to *my* personal email and credit card? I enjoy my children, but not *that much*.

🪅 **Kids Mode Chaos**

* Is there a built-in or downloadable **Kids Mode** that lets *me* decide what lives there? On Fire Kids+, once you enter the portal, suddenly Netflix vanishes like Santa under FBI questioning. So I end up giving access to the main tablet… which instantly opens Pandora’s Play Store.

📦 **The App Hoarder Problem**

* My kids download apps like they’re collecting Pokémon. Next thing I know, storage is full and the tablet moves like it’s underwater. ➡️ Are there controls on the **A9+** that let me limit how many things they can download? (Bonus points if it stops them at “do you *really* need Bubble Simulator 47?”)

💾 **SD Cards: Christmas Edition**

* Do I need the **fastest SD card known to mankind**, or will a normal one handle kids games and streaming without issue? Asking for a parent who doesn’t want to spend NASCAR money on Paw Patrol.

🎄🎁  
If the A9+ can fix even **half** of this nonsense, I’ll happily escort the Fire tablets into retirement with a quiet carol and minimal tears. Appreciate any guidance before I install setup #17… with coffee this time.",1,1765239998.0,GalaxyTab,0,1.0,False

1. Findom is one of the best forms of power exchange. Every single time you send to your domme, you're not sending her only your money, but the time, effort and energy it took to earn that money. Essentially, you are giving her your life basically. Is there a better way to show your love and admiration for someone? After all, love is a sacrifice.

2. You're making the better gender happy. Or amused. Or horny. Or all three. This one is self explanatory. Don't you want that?

3. You are giving that money to someone who knows better. Majority of us here spend too much money on stupid things, realistically speaking. No way that PS4 game and 6 pack of beer is more important than the pair of shoes she likes, or her date, or a coffee with friends. By sending you're essentially putting that money to best use.

4. You will likely never feel fulfilled without findom. If you're here, you've probably sent before or you intend to send. Deep down you know yourself that you want this and no matter how many times you go [deleted] you'll always come back. 

So, my word of advice to every sub reading this is to go and send to her. Fulfill your purpose and your role in the society.

1pht60q,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceNZ/comments/1pht60q/broken_table_at_byo_venue/,Broken Table at BYO Venue,"I’m curious to get people’s thoughts on the situation below.

A couple of weeks ago, I was at a BYO golf simulator venue with 6–7 friends. We had the venue booked for three hours. Inside were swivel chairs, a couch, a large sandstone table, and a smaller sandstone side table. We moved the chairs and couch to make space to sit, watch each other play, and enjoy a few beers.
At the end of the session, we started putting everything back. I picked up the small coffee table and accidentally tripped. The table top wasn’t attached to the base at all—no screws, bolts, or glue. When I lifted it, I tripped over the base because I couldn’t see it. I don’t think anyone expects a table base not to be attached to the top.

It was funny at the time (me being sprawled out on the floor), but I’ve since been advised that the table needs replacing. The wholesale cost is $630 (retail $1,000). I haven’t been asked to pay yet, but I expect that may be coming.
We weren’t being reckless and were using the furniture normally. There were no signs, T&Cs, or house rules saying the furniture couldn’t be moved. The venue also has CCTV, which should show there was no intent or careless behaviour—just us returning the room to how we found it.

I understand that if I hadn’t touched the table, it would still be fine. However, how liable am I really? I took reasonable care—it’s a 20kg table, so it’s not exactly something you can handle recklessly. This could easily have happened to anyone: a child leaning on it, a golf bag knocking it, etc.

It also seems harsh given that the table top wasn’t secured to the base in any way.

This post isn’t me saying I won’t take some responsibility or help with the cost. It’s more about covering my bases in case it comes to that.

We need some wardrobes built in - we have very high ceilings - and wanted them in wood rather than melamine so they can be painted to match the walls.

Am I crazy or is $50 000 insane for built ins wardrobes? Does this guy just not want the job? Or is it because I asked for wood not craft wood for some of them?

I've gone to a few classes and done some wheel time but I am curious about supplies and where to start. Mainly the kiln as most are quite expensive and probably entirely too large for me as a curious crafter. I would like something large enough to do plant pots or coffee cups and trinkets but small enough it won't take up an obscene amount of space. How did you all get started? Where is the best place to buy a kiln? I live in a small town and can not consistently drive over an hour to the closest place that does firing and lessons unfortunately. Open to any and all information regarding getting started. Thanks! ,3,1765239331.0,Pottery,3,0.8,False

1phsz8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1phsz8r/sudden_aversion_to_food/,Sudden aversion to food,"Hi, I've noticed a change in my relationship with food and beverages lately. I checked the list of symptoms in the wiki and did notice there was a mention of a change in food tastes. I'm also aware it could be related to medication I'm taking and/or other conditions, but I'm looking for ideas for how to get past this.

My aversion to most foods has been going on since around Thanksgiving (US). I normally have a hearty appetite and eat a variety of things. I'm also normally a big coffee drinker and not big on drinking water. 

The first thing I noticed was that I lost interest in coffee. I ordered an iced latte out of habit and it tasted too sweet. I couldn't finish it. I kept trying different coffees and either they were too sweet or not sweet enough, but overall I felt like I was forcing myself to drink it.

Then I noticed that I would only want one kind of food because everything else sounded disgusting to me. The food that I want changes on a daily basis (one day pizza, one day tacos) but overall I want things that are carby and salty. I woke up one day wanting oatmeal. By the time it was ready I had to force it down. It literally took me an hour to finish my bowl! 

This is driving me crazy because I'm tired of ordering food, especially junk food, but I don't want to starve. 

I know craving carbs is usually attributed to a lack of sleep, but I've been getting plenty of hours and good quality. 

I've been taking estradiol cream 3x a week, Dotti twice a week, and Progesterone for 3-4 months. 

I started taking Metformin for weight loss (prescribed my Midi) for two months and haven't lost any weight. I noticed that if I take it later in the day instead of with breakfast I get this overly full feeling. 

I've also been having symptoms I'd consider related to PMS: headaches, bloating, gas, alternating constipation and diarrhea. I've had wicked heartburn as well. I've tried drinking more water but I have an aversion to water too.

TL;DR: my dietary preferences have changed dramatically and I'm frustrated. Looking for advice or stories from others who've experienced this.

So I’m calling it **A Cup of Kindness** — a small holiday tradition where I’ll be handing out free coffees (**$10 Kaladi gift cards**) around Anchorage all month.

No set schedule. No big event. Just popping up at parks, downtown, bus stops, markets, or wherever people are out braving the winter. I also plan on doing **one more round of the Spot the Sweater game at the Cuddy Park Solstice Festival on 12/19.**

The coffees will go to:  
• people out walking  
• workers out in the cold  
• folks waiting for the bus  
• volunteers  
• vendors  
• or anyone who looks like they could use a warm moment in the dark season

If you want to toss a cup into the mix:  
👉 [https://buy.stripe.com/28E4gz9pz3B4cttc7m8og05](https://buy.stripe.com/28E4gz9pz3B4cttc7m8og05)

Every dollar goes straight to more gift cards. 💛  
(My personal budget is only $200, so anything extra helps me hand out more)

It’s just a low-key December thing — nothing fancy — meant to make Anchorage feel a little warmer. I’ll share updates throughout the month.

Wishing you a warm December out there. ☕ ❄️

I went very hard the first two years and feel like I am running low on slam-dunk surprise gift ideas this year. We are also flying this Christmas to see his family so I don’t want to go too sentimental. I’ve already purchased a new PC part and a few small things from his wish list but would like to come up with a few gifts myself too. 


Their interests:

Gaming PC and Xbox (War Thunder, Battlefield, RDR are the main games right now). They do not need or want any hardware or keyboard, controllers, desk/chair etc and I have already previously gifted them an Elite Xbox controller, flight stick and mount and steering wheel. We both have retro game collections but my last few buys for that were busts. 


Music. They used to play bass and guitar often, but haven’t played music in a while. I gifted them a ukulele last year (not used much). They are getting a harmonica from another family member. 


Photography. He has a Canon camera with a few lenses and recently got a camera bag. I don’t know much about photography but for his birthday this year he got a new lens. 


Experiences. We make it a goal to travel as much as possible and are doing a smaller Christmas to instead take a vacation in spring. We are road trip, within the US sort of travelers so possibly something relating to travel? He has a newer suitcase and we have mid-tier, used once (so far) camping gear. 


“Cozy” type items. We both love candles and I have gifted candles before however I expect to get a number of candles. They have new house shoes, and I don’t think would use a bathrobe. 


Art. We are both artists however he asked for and got art supplies from a friend last year and just used them for the first time last month. So.. probably not useful. 


Planes/Aviation/History. He’s very into planes. Hence the War Thunder lol. He has a plane encyclopedia, some binoculars from WW1, a number of models. I’ve previously gifted a handmade plush toy of his favorite plane.


Other past gifts include a bow, arrows and targets, a poster from his childhood bedroom he missed, merch from games and tv shows, coffee maker setup, plenty of handmade gifts and art, several pairs of shoes. 


I would love to gift him something he will actually use. I tried thinking of the “upgrade something they already use” route but it’s all so specific to hobbies or not worth upgrading (nicer bedsheets, home appliances, towel warmer etc. are all things only I care about, haha). Trinkets and collectibles rarely ever even make it onto a shelf. 


We do not drink, he does not need a new wallet, enjoy grilling, yard work, or wear cologne. 


Please help!!! Am I making this too complicated? I’m hoping to spend 100-150 on gifts but am willing to go up on that for a truly great gift. Thank you so much for reading all of this!",2,1765238941.0,santashelpers,1,1.0,False

1phstu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1phstu9/akiri_yagi_hija_de_allmigth/,Akiri yagi hija de allmigth,"Akari Yagi was exactly four years and eleven months old when the world discovered that she was no ordinary child.

It was a spring afternoon in the secluded house on the outskirts of Musutafu, the same one where his parents had built their little secret universe. The backyard was full of wildflowers that Toshinori devotedly tended (red roses like Midnight's outfit and golden sunflowers like All Might's hair). Akari ran barefoot between them, dressed in pink overalls stained with dirt and her hair tied up in two high pigtails: one jet black like her mother's, the other platinum blonde like her father's. An unruly strand escaped from each side, as if his own body couldn't decide who to imitate.

Toshinori, now in his fifties, thin but still upright, watched her from the terrace with a cup of tea in his hand. He was wearing an old U.A. T-shirt. and sweatpants. The wrinkles around his eyes were deeper, but the smile he gave his daughter was the same one that had saved the world hundreds of times.

—Dad, look! Akari shouted, raising both arms.

And then it happened.

A ring of gold and violet light (exactly the colors of One For All at his peak and the Somnambulist from Midnight) erupted around his little body. The grass beneath his feet lit up as if someone had turned on an internal spotlight. The flowers straightened, the sunflowers turned towards her as if she were a brighter sun. And Akari, with a mischievous giggle, jumped.

He rose three meters into the air.

It didn't float. Leap. Strongly. With control. With a smile that was pure defiance.

Toshinori dropped the cup. The tea spilled on the wood, but he didn't even notice. His blue eyes opened so much that they seemed to be those of the Symbol of Peace again.

""Akari... come down right now, little one,"" he said with a trembling voice, but not from fear. Of pure emotion.

She obeyed, landing with the grace of a cat. She ran towards him and threw herself into his arms.

""I did it, dad!"" I flew like you and mom!

Toshinori hugged her so tight that her heart felt like it was going to burst. Because I had just recognized it. It wasn't just brute force. He wasn't just Somnambulist. It was something new. Something that had been born from the impossible union of One For All (although he no longer had it) and Nemuri's sedative quirk.

A hybrid Quirk.

A quirk that combined the light and strength of All Might with the sensory control and hypnotic seduction of Midnight.

And it already manifested itself at four years old.

That night, after putting Akari to bed (who kept literally jumping on the bed whenever she got excited), Toshinori sat in the study that had been Nemuri's. She turned on the old camera she used to record the videos for Akari and saw a random one. His voice filled the room:

«If you are seeing this, little light, it means that you are already big. And if your quirk came out... well, a little crazy, don't be scared. It's because you are the daughter of two crazy people who loved each other too much. Use that power to protect those who cannot protect themselves. And if one day you are afraid... remember that mom and dad will always be with every jump you take.

Toshinori turned off the recording with shaking hands. Then he pulled out his phone and dialed the only number he knew he would understand.

""Aizawa,"" he said when they answered. We have a problem.  
Or rather... we have a new generation.

The next day, Aizawa came home with his usual scarf and a sleepy face. Mirko jumped over the back fence half an hour later, with a box of donuts and a smile that said “I knew this was going to happen.”

Akari met them running, barefoot and wearing a t-shirt that said “Future No.1 Hero” (a gift from Mirko).

—Uncle Shota! Aunt Rumi! Behold!

And he did it again. Leap. Glow. He landed in Mirko's arms, who let out a whistle.

—Fuck, Yagi. The girl is a fucking rocket with neon lights.

Aizawa scratched the back of his neck.  
—Early Manifestation Hybrid Quirk. Never seen anything like this. And with that level of power at four years old...  
He looked at Toshinori seriously.  
—He's going to need training. And protection. Lots of protection.

Toshinori nodded. I knew what was coming. The U.A. It was no longer just a school for him; It was the place where he had lost Nemuri, where he had seen too many friends fall. But it was also the only place where Akari could learn to control what was inside her.

""He'll come in when he's old enough,"" he said firmly. But until then... I'll train her. And you. Like family.

Mirko lifted Akari onto his shoulders.  
-That is! Training with the fastest girl in the world! Let's make you a legend, little light.

Akari laughed, and the garden lit up again with her quirk. A golden-violet light that seemed to say: ""Here I am. And I'm not going to hide.""

Somewhere, in the wind that moved the flowers, Toshinori swore he felt Nemuri's laughter. Proud. Free. Eternal.

And so, fifteen years after Midnight gave her life for the world, her daughter—the girl no one knew existed—began to shine with a light that threatened to eclipse even the ancient Symbol of Peace.

The legacy was not over.

It was just beginning.

￼





The diagnostic room at Musutafu General Hospital smelled of disinfectant and cheap coffee.  
Toshinori Yagi, dressed in an oversized gray sweatshirt and a cap pulled down over his eyebrows, held his daughter's hand tightly. Akari was wearing a navy blue pleated skirt, high socks with bunnies on them, and a bright pink backpack that looked bigger than her. Her pigtails were still a black one and a blonde one, but now the blonde locks had violet reflections when the light hit them directly.

—Are we going to draw my blood, dad? he asked in a sing-song voice, swinging his feet on the chair.  
—No, little light. They're just going to do some tests with lights and sounds. Like when we play “how bright are you today?” at home.  
Akari smiled, showing the gap where her baby tooth was missing.  
—I shine a lot! Yesterday I jumped onto the garage roof. I almost touched the antenna!

Toshinori swallowed. Yes. He almost touched the antenna... and almost gave him a heart attack.

Doctor Kyudai Garaki no longer worked at that hospital (thank goodness), but his successor, Doctor Hoshino (a petite woman in her fifties with a medical analysis quirk) was one of the best specialists in children's quirks in the country. Aizawa had pulled strings to make the appointment confidential and outside of public hours.

The doctor entered with a tablet and a friendly smile.

—Okay, little Akari. Will you let me see your light?

Akari stood up on the stretcher, closed her eyes like her father had taught her, and took a deep breath.

A controlled, yet impressive burst of golden-violet energy filled the room. The fluorescent lights flickered. The heart monitor beeped faster. The doctor's eyes widened.

-Perfect. Now again, but try to make it more… gentle.

Akari frowned in concentration. The light turned into a warm aura that wrapped around his body like a second skin. Then he made a small jump and hovered a foot above the ground, spinning slowly as if he were in zero gravity.

Toshinori felt his eyes water. It was exactly the mix of the two quirks he loved most in life.

The doctor took notes for fifteen more minutes: strength tests (Akari effortlessly lifted a 15kg weight with one hand), pain resistance tests (zero reaction), hypnotic control tests (she made a nurse fall asleep standing up just by looking at him and whispering “sleep”), and speed tests (she crossed the room in the blink of an eye, leaving a trail of purple sparks).

Finally, Dr. Hoshino took off her glasses and looked at Toshinori seriously.

—Mr. Yagi... your daughter has an extremely rare mutant-emitter hybrid type quirk. We have officially registered it under the name:

«Luminous Somnambulist»  
(Japanese: 光夢遊病 - Hikari Muyūbyō)

Main features:

1. Generation and manipulation of high-density light energy (golden-violet color).  
2. Extreme physical reinforcement (strength, speed and resistance well above the child average).  
3. Floating and limited flight for now (will probably evolve).  
4. Controlled emission of hypnotic and somniferous pheromones (inherited from the mother).  
5. Possible emotional amplification: the happier or angrier you are, the more powerful the energy output will be.

The doctor paused.

—And most importantly: it is an early manifestation Quirk with exponential growth potential. At six years old, he already surpasses the level of many B-rank pro heroes in raw power. If he keeps up this pace... at sixteen he could be in the Top 10 without effort.

Toshinori felt the breath escape him. Pride, fear, nostalgia... all together.

—Is it… dangerous for her?  
—Not physically. His body seems designed to withstand it. But emotionally… you will need constant guidance. And protection. Lots of protection. A Quirk like that attracts unwanted attention.

Akari, who had been listening with her head tilted, raised her hand as if in class.

—I want to be the number one heroine! Like dad and mom!

Toshinori bent down and hugged her tightly.

—And you will be, little light. But first… primary.

One week later: first day of school at Seiai Private Elementary School (the same one where Midoriya went as a child, chosen for its low profile and safety).

Toshinori had spent the previous night without sleeping. Iron the uniform. Prepare the bunny-shaped bentō. Write a hundred times on a piece of paper “don't cry in front of her, Yagi, you're All Might, damn it.” He had put Nemuri's video on loop until four in the morning:

«Akari, the first day of school is terrifying and wonderful. Make friends. Be brave. And if someone bothers you... remember that your mom could put an entire stadium to sleep with a smile. ""You can do much more.""

At 7:45 in the morning, Toshinori and Aizawa (who insisted on accompanying “for safety”) were waiting in front of the school gate. Toshinori in a gray suit and tie (he looked like a normal father... if you ignored the fact that he was almost two meters tall and skinny). Aizawa with his scarf and eternally sleepy face.

Akari entered the classroom without looking back, waving and shouting “I love you!”

The teachers almost fainted when they saw who the father and the “uncle” who accompanied her was.

The day passed without incident. Akari made friends instantly: she was charismatic, funny, and when she got excited she glowed a little, enough to make everyone say “wow!” instead of being scared.

At 2:30 p.m., departure time.

Akari ran out, pink backpack bouncing, holding the hand of a freckled boy with dark green hair and big eyes. The boy's name was Haruto and he talked non-stop about dinosaurs.

-Dad! Uncle Shota! Look, Haruto says that velociraptors had feathers and...!

Haruto looked up.

And he saw the two adults.

Toshinori, all six feet tall, with crossed arms and a smile that was meant to be friendly but, combined with his sunken eyes and scars, looked like something out of a horror movie.

Aizawa, with the scarf up to his nose, murderous look and hair floating slightly because of his activated quirk ""just in case.""

Poor Haruto was petrified. She let go of Akari's hand as if it were burning, turned around and ran screaming towards her mother who was waiting on the other side of the street.

Akari blinked, confused.

—Why did he run away? If only we were going to play tomorrow!

Toshinori scratched the back of his neck, embarrassed. Aizawa let out a long sigh.

""I think we... intimidated him a little,"" Toshinori murmured.

Akari put her arms on her hips, indignant.

—Well, Haruto is very brave! He said he wanted to be my boyfriend!

Aizawa almost choked on his own scarf.

Toshinori felt his blood pressure rise into the stratosphere.

-Boyfriend? You are six years old!

Akari looked at him with bright eyes and a mischievous smile. Exactly the same smile Nemuri used when she wanted to get her way.

—He gave me a flower at recess! Look!

He took a half-crushed daisy out of his pocket.

Toshinori placed a hand on his chest. Aizawa, for the first time in years, let out a dry laugh.

—Welcome to hell, Yagi. Your daughter just activated Midnight mode at age six.

That night, while Akari slept cuddling her All Might plushie, Toshinori sat in the kitchen with a cup of cold tea. He took out Nemuri's old phone and played the video that hurt him the most and comforted him the most at the same time:

«If one day Akari brings home a child... don't scare him too much, Toshinori. Remember that you were also a disaster in love once. And if he is worthy of her... let him come closer. But only a little bit.

Toshinori smiled with tears in his eyes.

—Calm down, Nemuri. I'll try. But if he tries to kiss her before he's thirty... I'll throw him into space.

In the next room, Akari dreamed of flying higher than anyone else, with gold and violet lights illuminating the sky.

And somewhere, far away, a star shone a little brighter.

I tried Strattera and Wellbutrin, and ALL the “natural” approaches, with minimal success, before finally agreeing to trial a stimulant. I absolutely think Adderall is the reason I’ve been able to do better in school, and it allows me to actually sit still and focus on tasks that previously would have been nearly impossible for me to do. It also (shockingly, to me at least) nearly eradicated all of my intrusive thoughts that I’d suffered with for most of my life. My brain was quieter. I was less talkative and interrupting people less.

But lately I’ve wondered how much it was affecting my personality. I took 3 days off during the Thanksgiving holiday because of a med shortage, and they sucked—I was exhausted, my body ached, and I felt foggy and just generally awful. But once I got to the last half of the third day, I was suddenly feeling like me again; and I hadn’t even realized that I hadn’t felt like ME in a while.

I took it for the next couple of days for work, and then stopped again. I just picked up my prescription today after a week of deliberating whether I wanted it, because I seriously feel happier than I have in a while. I almost feel high off of my own brain chemistry. I’m definitely more scattered and chaotic, but I also feel freer, calmer, and more at ease. I can still function relatively well, since I am quite hyperactive so I’m always busy and always doing things. I just don’t finish them, lol. 

Is this some weird rebound effect? Or is the medication just not a good fit for me? I noticed that I was often irritable in the morning after taking it, and felt a need to isolate myself and focus on a solitary activity which was affecting my interactions with my partner. I also craved caffeine while I was on it (I’ve been a coffee addict for a long time anyway) and my coffee consumption was through the roof while on Adderall. I’m sure that didn’t help with my feelings of being on edge and anxious. Anyway, just wanted to share my experience. Tomorrow will be interesting because I had today off of work and I’ll be seeing how I do off the meds while trying to do my job . ",1,1765238830.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False

In terms of networking, I've mostly been cold messaging folks on LinkedIn who I want to connect with, and offering to take them out to Coffee. This worked for me throughout law school, but is pretty expensive and a little tiresome and very time intensive considering you can only meet 1 person at a time. 

What would be ideal are some sort of Professional Gala or something - I've been invited to a few with the firm I work for - but obviously these don't happen everyday and they are mainly for clients - so I shouldn't be using them as a meet and greet - and usually I already know everyone going to them anyway. 

I've tried to go to Professional events on Meetup.com.....but those have never really impressed me. The folks there seem to be looking more for a date than anything else - and there are a lot of folks who ghost on the event entirely (there can be almost 40 people listed as ""going"", but only 10 show up).

My SIL loves to make espresso martinis with the following recipe:

1oz Bailey's Original Irish Cream

2oz Espresso

1oz Vodka

We would like to get her a really nice Irish Cream (not Bailey's) for her for Christmas.

What Irish Cream is comparable in vibe/flavor profile to Bailey's, but BETTER? And good in espresso martinis?

She likes the creaminess that Bailey's offers and has notes that she usually hates espresso martinis in bars, which I think use a coffee liqueur instead of an Irish Cream.

My gf is very spontaneous and one day got us two tickets to go to New York j for a day trip, she had already been to the city twice but knew I hadn’t and thought it would be great to take me all expenses paid j for the day. I instantly got nervous and because I have OCD I knew it was something I would ruminate over, that’s mainly the reason why I am only posting my success story, I knew any prior reassurance would just make things worse. Anyways I got on my flight Saturday morning to New York, only a 2.5 hour flight from Florida, and it went better than I ever expected. TRUST ME THE WORST PART ABOUT FLYING IS TSA. Some thing was wrong with the scannable part of my ID and both times I was sent back to the check in desk for nothing, had to remake the line and then eventually let through after 5 different agents look at my boarding pass and ID. I was almost relieved just to finally be on the plane the morning of my departure😂. Anyways I really though the turbulence would had made me scared but it was pretty bad on the way back and I just gave in. I really think that not trying to “fight” the turbulence and stay still really helped, I was just there almost imagining I was on a shitty pothole infested road 😂 and it really helped ease the feeling. Also another thing that helped was on my returning flight the flight attendants actually skipped me in line and later I found out they were running extremely late and had to get on the plane asap to get things ready, idk why but this made me j comfortable with the fact that flight attendants and pilots are just like me. Human, and they were more than fine with getting on that flight and starting their day off flying. If your reading this and are nervous. It’s okay, you can’t be brave without being scared first , trust me though you’ll feel like your the shit once you land. Another tip I would add is if your a cannabis user I would avoid smoking before the flight, I really think I was extra calm because wi was also looking forward to landing and taking a rip off the dab pen as soon as I got to the city, almost like the no coffee tip I see people mentioning. Anyways I hope anyone who reads this and has a flight soon has a great trip! Get on that plane. ",2,1765238469.0,fearofflying,1,1.0,False
1phsn5t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phsn5t,Week 2 of Starting My Candle Brand… a thank you and a few things I’ve learned!,"Hey everyone,

I’m back for week two of building my candle brand, and the first thing I want to do is say thank you. The support on my last post was absolutely incredible. My friends and I were literally sitting around reading the replies with the biggest smiles on our faces. Seeing an idea I’ve talked about for almost three years finally get some appreciation meant more than you know.

While I learned a ton about candlemaking from this subreddit, I realized something pretty quickly once I actually started the business side of things: it’s really hard to find solid advice online about launching a candle brand. Tons of tutorials on wax, wicks, temps, CT, HT… but barely anything about the business side. So I figured I’d share a few things I’ve already learned in my very short time doing this, in case it helps someone else starting out.

The biggest thing I’ve learned so far is that content is king. When you’re pouring and testing, you’re a candlemaker. But the second production for the day or week is done, you’re now a full-time content creator whether you like it or not. I have friends in ecommerce and I can confidently say about 80 percent of their time goes into brainstorming content, shooting content, or editing content.

And honestly, the content people love the most, especially right now with TikTok and Instagram, is simple, relatable, low-budget, real content. I had zero budget for product photography as a fresh college grad. What did I do? I looked around my room for props. I went to Trader Joe’s and bought a single tomato. That was basically it. Every product shot was made using whatever I already had. The images on my website? Those are from friends. I scrolled through their Instagrams, found photos that matched the vibe of my scents, and asked if I could use them. Free, authentic, and way more interesting than something overly polished.

But static images are the easy part. Videos, for Reels and TikTok, are where the real growth happens. A few things have helped me: taking a quick video at my local coffee shop, filming little moments throughout my day, and planning ahead. I have a trip with friends in January and while they’re skiing in the mornings, I’ll be shooting content by myself. Not forced, just using what’s already around me.

The way I look at it now is simple. Your life doesn’t need to revolve around making content. Just make content revolve around your life. Be yourself. Be genuine. That alone will make someone want to support you way more than any polished ad you try to force out when you’re first starting. People support people.

I hope this was helpful, even in a small way. If you all want, I’d be happy to keep documenting this journey here. There are so many videos online about running a business, but barely anything truly genuine about starting a candle brand from scratch... and it’s the kind of thing I wish I had a few months ago.

If you ever have questions, feel free to DM me. Happy to help however I can.

Thanks again for the amazing support so far. You all really made my week.",2,1765238441.0,candlemaking,2,0.75,False

1phsmfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1phsmfo/my_dad/,My dad,"My dad died in the summer this year.  He became ill, was diagnosed with terminal cancer and was dead within three months.  It was awful and I try very hard not to dwell on what happened to him during that time.

Random memories of my dad's life keep popping into my head and I try to think of those instead.  They are much nicer.

There was the time when I was quite young and my dad was one of the guys in our village who helped put out a fire in a local small shop.  He must have been in his thirties at the time and was a big hero.

Dad could make anything, fix anything.  I had an expensive pair of fancy leather shoes once and my dog got hold of them. I thought they were ruined and was really upset but my dad managed to fix them somehow with a new piece of leather, good as new.  He was very skilled at all sorts of things.

He was in the building trade and won a national award for his work.

There was the time mum and dad's neighbour managed to lock himself out of his house.  The neighbour was drunk, it was night and the dead of winter.  He called round to my parents' for help.  He sat on their sofa,  drinking the coffee mum made for him, whilst dad got his ladders out and managed to get into the neighbour's house, without damaging anything, via a small upstairs window.  And dad was a big guy, so I don't know how he did that.  Saved the neighbour the expense and hassle of a locksmith.

I remember we had an eclipse of the sun once.  Dad didn't have a piece of white card, so he was trying to project it onto a piece of toast.  It was at breakfast time.  We were both laughing our heads off, it was ridiculous.  There is a photo of the pair of us pulling silly faces, pointing at the sky.  I think he gave me his appreciation of general silliness, aswell as his silver hair.

Dad used to take me to the swimming pool as a child and I would hang onto his neck and ride on his back like a turtle. 

The rescue cat mum and dad adopted.  The cat had problems and was pretty aggressive with everyone, so you didn't get too close to him.  Apart from dad.  The cat would lie in his lap with his legs in the air, purring and having his chin scratched.  It was astonishing.

The pond he built in our back garden.  The way he used to mix up the sand, water and cement with a spade, watching him bricklaying.

Dad was a social drinker and would go to the pub, there were a few in our village.  There would always be some sort of lock-in after hours for the regulars.  When I got my driving licence I used to pick dad and his mates up, take them all home.  He had a nice gang of friends and they all seemed to have fun.  Dad was in charge of the summer barbecue once at one of the pubs.

Even as he was becoming ill, he was still helping people.  I drove him to the supermarket towards the end and there was a lady having problems with her car. He stopped to see if she was alright, even though his health was failing and he must have felt really bad.

The time when I was upset about something at university, can't even remember what it was.  Dad drove out a long way, in the middle of the night, to pick me up and bring me home, no questions asked.

The massive plates of food he always made for me when I went round to see them.  The new recipes he was trying out.  The endless cups of tea and danish pastries given to me.  The takeaways we used to share.  The times we used to stuff our faces and joke around.

I'm struggling a bit, to be honest.  I was tidying up and I found the last birthday card he sent to me.  It was so very painful to see.  I'm going home to see mum at Christmas and my dad's ashes are in an urn on the sideboard.  I haven't seen them yet and I'm dreading it.  I really miss him.",1,1765238401.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

Context: this was my first relationship after bad marriage that escalated to mental and physical abuse before I managed to get away. I (35f) have been entirely open and forthcoming with my struggles and things that I am working towards overcoming in regards to relationships from the start. He (46m) has been graciously understanding, and has even helped me with a few things to the point that I am not as reactive to certain situations as I was prior; think more calm and rational reactions, less fight or flight/panic-induced reactions. Because of my past, I do at times struggle with intimacy. We have had multiple discussions about this and have found things that work for both of us to help when anything has come up, and he has (mostly) been okay with this as well. 

Fast forward, we are 11, almost 12 months into the relationship. His eagerness for physical relations seems to be constantly growing to the point that he attempts to initiate something every single time we see each other. I had expressed to him on more than one occasion that I do not always want to have sex every single time we see each other, and that it feels to me that he is being pushy about it which makes me that much more less inclined to be 'in the mood' so to speak. The first few times I had to bring this up were fine and he toned things down. 

He stayed over at my apartment over the weekend from Thursday through Saturday since we both had our own plans Saturday evening. The weekends have become about the only free time we have with each other at the moment due to life and work obligations. As soon as we get to my apartment Thursday, he is all hands. I understand he missed me, I had missed him as well, but we hadn't even been in the door all of three minutes. I stepped back, let him know I was not in the mood for sex as I was menstruating, but was fine with affection. He said it was fine, went and sat down and was on his phone. We ended up putting something on television and sitting down to eat supper. After food and cleanup, I attempted to cuddle a bit with him while we continued our show. Sat next to him, put my head on his shoulder and held his hand. After about 2 episode he gets up and goes outside to smoke (I don't smoke and my apartment doesn't allow it in the units). When he came back in, he says he is tired and asked if I wanted to lay down or stay up. We go to bed and he just seems awkward. I put my arm across his chest like I normally do, but he was just laying there stiff on his back almost like he didn't want me to touch him. I asked if everything was alright for him to reply ""yeah, just tired"" before rolling over away from me. 

Friday was a good day. We went and got coffee together like usual, went to the mall to walk around, did a few other little things together and just enjoyed the day. Things seemed fine until later after we got back to my apartment. Dinner and a movie, cleanup together with some light conversation and music on in the background... I wasn't feeling the greatest, so I sat down and turned my heating pad on. When I asked if there was anything he would like to do he replied with ""just you"" and a wink. I told him again that I was not interested in sex right now and cramps were not helping the mood, hence the heating pad. Music was still on, so to break the silence I asked if he had heard back from his friend that he had concert plans with Saturday night because he had mentioned he didn't know if his friend was still going to show up or not. Ended up just sitting there talking and listening to music for a couple hours. I honestly enjoyed it, even with how crummy I was feeling. 

At a lull in the conversation I informed him that I wanted to lay down early because I wasn't feeling well still and because we had planned to be up early for coffee before I had to take him back to his home. He said that he wanted to have a smoke before bed then let out a huge sigh and just looked at the floor. I asked him what was up. He told me he was bummed that we didn't get the whole weekend because he had the concert to go to and he just wanted to spend time with me. I was a bit confused (isn't that what we've been doing??); I told him that there was always time in the morning before I had to take him home. 

This is the point that things started to feel off for me; his immediate response to that was 'Oh? I wouldn't have thought you were like that."" I had no idea what he meant, so I asked him outright. He responded with 'I've never had a woman wake me up like that, by sucking me off."" I was extremely confused as to how we got here seemingly out of the blue, so I admit that my reply was not the greatest; I asked ""Is that something you would be interested in having me do to you?"" He eagerly responded yes, his eyes and face lighting up. I told him that maybe that was a conversation that we could have another time, as I was already tired and not in the right mindset for that discussion.

Next morning rolls around. Wake up, shower, go get coffee. When we get back to my place I asked if there was anything he would like to do before he had to go; we still had about 3 hours or so until I had to have him back home to make it to a birthday party (my Saturday plans). He said he wasn't sure and was messing around on his phone so I grabbed my book and sat down with him to read. Roughly every 15 to 20 minutes he was letting out this overly exaggerated sigh. When he would get up to go smoke he was nearly slamming the door on his way out, walking fast and stiff... general signs that told me something was wrong, even though he hadn't. Every time this happened and I asked if he was okay, he would say he was fine. I asked multiple times if there was something he wanted to do or watch together, even going so far as to offer suggestions that were shot down. Because of this, I continued to read my book until it was time to take him home. 

When I dropped him off, we did sit in the driveway for about 10 minutes or so trying to talk (read as me trying to pry anything out of him to explain his behavior). It ended up with both of us becoming more frustrated and not really getting anywhere as he kept repeating that he ""just wanted to spend time with me"". After that, I went to the birthday party I had to attend, he went to his concert. 

Throughout the day we had attempted to discuss things over text, but it was doing no good. I did step away at my event a few times in an attempt to call him and speak over the phone instead of text, but he refused to answer and sent me to voicemail every time. I let him know multiple times that I did not want to continue a discussion of this magnitude over text messages, as he had misinterpreted a few things and no amount of me attempting to clarify helped. Eventually he agreed that we could talk the next day (Sunday) to work through things. At least until he got home from his concert and I informed him that I had also made it home safely. He started digging in again, but I stood firm on my boundary that I refused to continue discussing it over text and we could talk the next day, even telling him that I was going to bed. He refused to accept this and said ""No, this is goodbye"", which I took to mean we were done, just like that. After the events of those few days, I was fine with that ending and agreed with him on it. 

As Sunday evening came around and I was doing some cleaning around my apartment, I came across some of his belongings that had been left behind. I sent him a text asking him to let me know when would be a good time for me to get his things back to him. When he finally replied, he absolutely unleashed on me with how everything was my fault and I'm a terrible person. I responded in turn for pointing out that I have nothing to do with his misinterpretation that attempted to clear up, but he refused to do before blocking him.

I have a few close female friends and one male friend that I have discussed this situation with, and the females tell me that I was way out of line and overreacted big time, while the male friend says the opposite. I personally feel like I stuck to my boundaries in a huge way throughout this situation and handled it in a more mature way than I would have believed myself capable of prior. I mentioned to one of the female friends that my male friend believed the opposite of her and the other two and was met with an eye roll and a ""please, he just wants in your pants"" remark.

1phsi4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/hrblock/comments/1phsi4m/no_tax_on_tips_what_tipped_workers_need_to_know/,No Tax on Tips: What tipped workers need to know now,"Tips and taxes have been part of the tax code for ages. Now, with the [One Big Beautiful Bill](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/irs/tax-law-and-policy/one-big-beautiful-bill-taxes/) (OB3) going into effect, there are big changes in store for 2025 returns that affect just how much of your tips are taxed.

You probably have lots of questions about what this means for you—including [what you should be doing now if you’re a tipped worker.](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/income/wages/reporting-tip-income/#tracking)

Here’s the good news: H&R Block has answers. And, at tax time, we’ll be right by your side so you can claim all the tax benefits you qualify for.  


**TL;DR:** Starting with the 2025 tax year, eligible workers in jobs where tipping is customary can deduct up to $25,000 of tip income from federal income tax (not from Social Security/Medicare). The deduction phases out at $150,000 MAGI for most filers ($300,000 for joint filers). You still need to report tips to your employer by the 10th of each month and it’s smart to keep a daily log. The rule runs through 2028.

# What “No Tax on Tips” actually means

This is a deduction—not a complete tax-free pass on tips. Qualified tip income (up to $25,000 annually) is excluded from your federal income tax, but FICA (Social Security & Medicare) still applies. Your W‑2 will still reflect tip amounts for those payroll taxes.

Effective date: Applies to tips received on or after January 1, 2025 and is scheduled to end after 2028.

# Who qualifies

You must work in an occupation where tipping is customary (think restaurants, hospitality, salons, delivery, etc.). The Treasury will publish the formal list of eligible occupations; until then, the standard is whether tipping is customary in your role.

Income limits:

* Starts phasing out at $150,000 MAGI (most single filers)
* Starts phasing out at $300,000 MAGI (married filing jointly)
* Self‑employed: You can only deduct up to your net income from tip‑based work.

# What counts as a “qualified tip”

**Qualifies (voluntary, non‑negotiated, amount set by the customer):**

* **Cash/card tips**, including shared/pooled tips (each worker reports their share)
* **Extra amount beyond automatic gratuity** (the voluntary portion)

**Doesn’t qualify:**

* **Mandatory service charges** (large‑party auto‑gratuity, kitchen/staff fees)
* **Negotiated or auto‑added gratuities** that aren’t truly voluntary
* **Surcharges/fees** (e.g., a 3% service fee on every bill)
* **Non‑cash tips** (free meals, tickets, services, or other property)

**Quick examples:**

* A coffee shop suggests **18%, 20%, 25%**: the customer chooses **20%** → **qualifies**.
* A restaurant adds **18% automatic gratuity** and the customer tips **20% total** → the **extra 2% qualifies**; the **automatic 18% does not**.

# Reporting & records: what you need to do now

1. **Report monthly tips to your employer by the 10th** (for the prior month). Many workplaces have a process; you can also use IRS Form 4070 or your own report that includes your info, employer info, period covered, and the total tips received.
2. **Keep a daily tip log** (notebook, notes app, spreadsheet). Update in real time—don’t wait until year‑end.
3. **Watch withholding:** Federal income tax won’t be withheld on the portion of tips you’ll deduct (up to $25,000), but withholding may apply to tip income above that amount.
4. **Expect your W‑2** **to show your tips as part of gross income and the amounts used for Social Security/Medicare.** 

# Common questions

* **Are tips taxed at a special rate?** No. Tips are ordinary income; the new rule just lets you deduct up to $25,000 for federal income tax.
* **Did Congress pass this?** Yes. The “No Tax on Tips” provision was enacted as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4, 2025.
* **How long does it last?** Tax years 2025–2028.
* **Do I have to itemize to claim this?** No. You can claim it whether you itemize or take the standard deduction.

# Bottom line

If you earn tips, this change can lower your federal income tax—but only on qualified, voluntary tips, and FICA still applies. Start keeping a tight daily log, report monthly by the 10th, and save anything you use to track tips so you can claim the deduction accurately at tax time.

My sister, 31, has just moved back into my home after splitting(?) with her boyfriend. To be honest I’m not actually sure if the details but I think it’s over for them 

I’m not sure why it’s over but one thing I’ve managed to figure out is that it might’ve heavily been because of my sisters handling of finances 

She likes to live FAR above her means, and she’s obsessed with the idea of working for herself without even being able to hold down a part time.

Anyways before she moved in my mother and I were questioning the present she wants for Christmas - a £50 bundle of 2 self help journals by influencer Tam Kaur. Of course my mother and I are not people to refuse to buy what others want for Christmas, after all, that’s what Christmas is for.

At first I just jumped to believe that Tam Kaur was somehow taking advantage of people in desperate financial situations, being a “self care” influencer and selling £25 journals to your (as I have found out with a bit of research) young & impressionable audience.

However upon watching a few of her videos, she gives great advice. A little on the nose & generic for self help but I (21(m?)) am obviously not the target audience. It’s awesome that people do find her advice useful. 

That said my sister and I were talking about the journals via text (I’m not provoking her, she mentioned it) and it lead to a debate about influencers as a whole. She, and again the rest of Tam’s audience, are seriously dedicated to defending her and I’m worried that she’s fallen for an influencer trap, some kind of safe space that promises positive affirmations and such but no real change??

I think she has this idea that buying these books, and buying financial planners, and buying candles, and buying Starbucks coffee, and and and etc etc etc! Will lead to tangible success. I have not said it to her outright, as I don’t want to needlessly be rude about my approach, but she’s been doing exactly that for over a decade. Obviously this has not worked for her.

Am I overreacting about the idea that Tam Kaur, and lifestyle influencers by extension are a more subtle form of adult brain rot. Is it wrong for me to think that this is the doing, at least in part, of influencers and not just how she is wired? Furthermore would it be wrong for me to intervene on a deeper level than her finances?

If it’s any relevant, she is also known to fall for MLM schemes & just get rich quick flukes in general :(

1phsaqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkPsychology101/comments/1phsaqp/mental_asylum_called_socialmedia_education_is_the/,Mental Asylum Called SocialMedia: Education Is the Only Way,"A few days ago, I was sitting with my friend in a coffee shop, and the topic he brought up was how irritating people can be on social media, especially Instagram. He pointed out how people form opinions about things they aren’t fully aware of, yet still trigger thousands of others to react strongly. I’m certainly aware of this myself. I don’t engage much with the comment section or anyone on social media like Instagram. I build awareness there, but I prefer to learn from credible sources. Unfortunately, that’s not how people like to handle matters that contradict their own beliefs.
People have many layers, and some claim to be critical thinkers. That can be true, but not on every issue. Humans are different from many other beings; we learn, socialize, and experience a wider range of emotions through interactions. Unfortunately, on social media, many people aren’t even close to being critical thinkers or reasonable, let alone mature, simply because they are older. This cycle trains our children, and those who are more cognitively and emotionally flexible—like children who are still learning, or vulnerable individuals—are affected by it. This influences both youth and adults, shaping how we act, and can distort our sense of identity and mislead us.
People who constantly make emotionally charged statements with biased mindsets and locked cognitive functions don’t deserve your time to reason with them. However, these individuals, in different forms, are toxic influencers. Personally, I believe that any narcissistic behavior or aspects of the Dark Triad, to some extent, are necessary. I acknowledge how they exploit people’s needs, but this cycle will hurt both you and me—and the future. I can fully assess these types of people and explain why you need to recognize and avoid them, but I think you’ve already grasped this point through day-to-day interactions or observations.
However, this issue can’t be solved merely by taking Instagram away or avoiding it altogether, whether from your children or yourself. It’s not enough to simply remain skeptical of everyone you meet online or in real life. What we can do is build awareness and provide non-biased education. We need to educate ourselves and the people around us, be open to learning and thinking critically, but never avoid engaging with the issue. You can take Instagram away from your children or yourself, but it won’t change the fact that these matters will still influence us in many ways. Technology and news are integrated into our lives, so we can’t just run away from them. We must build awareness, educate ourselves, and learn how to deal with it. Eventually, we’ll meet people who probably should have been in a mental asylum but ended up either on social media or as someone like a ""Karen"" ringing your doorbell, saying, ""Your wall hit my car.""

I stressed this matter here because there are many people who can understand the impacts. Don’t underestimate the leverage of influencers on yourself (especially if you're dealing with vulnerabilities like recent loss or grief) and on children. Recognize the impostors who appear as ""white knights.""",2,1765237544.0,DarkPsychology101,0,1.0,False

(Pro tip! You can tap the status bar on iOS to scroll all the way to the top of a screen).

Next weeks update will focus mainly on bug fixes, I'll work my way through the backlog. Thanks for all the reports!

\--- 

To update the app please fully close and re-open it, it'll download the OTA update on startup (no App Store update needed).

**Fixes**

\- Fixed an issue where the search bar could vanish on the ""subscriptions"" screen if you searched for a subreddit that didnt exist.  
  
\- Removed auto formatting the subreddit name in the title of post pages (some subreddits did not play nice with this, this was already removed in subreddits)  
  
\- (android) Fixed an issue when saving videos from posts  
  
\- (android) Fixed an issue where the gesture tutorial button could be hidden under the 3 button android menu

Sharing my insights here for anyone who needs to read this.,"Back when I was taking my first steps as an entrepreneur, most of the people in my environment warned me about the riskiness of running my own business, and how less than 10% of all startups survive their first year. ""It most likely won't succeed"", they told me, ""Odds are against you"", and every other platitude most of us here have heard for God knows how many times.

The one thing no one warned me about was the Pandora's box of hardships that were to be unsealed once I got over that first hill and made it out of the Startup Phase.

# Early Game

I started my company three years ago with a simple premise: helping other small companies in my niche field market their products creatively and efficiently. I had a pretty unique strategy that resonated well with my ICP, and my focus was on quality and genuineness, which clients quickly picked up on. I secured a few long-term jobs early on with a, I'd say, less than 1% chance as a fresh-from-college unknown that I was. But they saw something in me and gave me a chance, and I couldn't have been happier about it.

Oh yes, and my prices were low. Like *really* low - I charged around $1000 for a month of work on multiple platforms. At the time, that money was *wow* for me, but looking from today's perspective, a petty change for the businesses I was reaching out to.

I also got recommendations from influential people in the field who believed in me and did their best to help. That was *the* lucky moment for my business, and probably the main reason I survived that first year. Cash was coming in, people were satisfied with my work, I soon added another person to the company, and it all made me think *“*Damn, I cracked it. This is it.*”*

But here’s the part no one tells you:

**Early success blinds you.** You think the momentum will last forever. You think scaling is just “copy what works, add more people"" but that can't be further from the truth.

Another year passed without much change. For sales, I mostly relied on the uniqueness of my services and the creative, out-of-the-box approach that I ""patented"". It was easy to sell, especially for the price that I held at the time. For operations - we established some routines and recurring processes, created the first version of our one-pager website on Carrd, and added another person to the team.

The business was on a smooth sail - some months we made enough to comfortably survive, some to consider expanding further. By this time, we had made enough money to make some improvements on the official stuff - website, service deck, contracts, etc. We could pay for tools like ChatGPT Enterprise, Lovable AI, Notion Business, Slack, etc., hire designers and coders from Devoted Fusion and Devoted Studios, or just outsource some of the work we're not skilled at to the professionals.

However, there was another trouble quietly brewing during this ""expansion"" period. As the company started growing, the business also started running into some issues, and it was all about to come crashing down on me.

# Expansion Phase

Before we dive into the issues that I faced and how I overcame them, I'd like to note that my goal here is not to demotivate people from wandering down the entrepreneurial path; but rather help them face these obstacles ready and capable, because they *will* come. Let's dive into them now:

* **My business was based on high-quality services. However, controlling the quality of the output became harder as I employed more people.**
   * My solution: 3-4 months of 1:1, 1-2 hour-long training/teaching of the new employees before they start working without my monitoring. I retained the quality to, I'd say 70-80%, but training new people became especially time-consuming.
* **Uniqueness of my approach** \- the main thing that helped sell my campaigns easily became an issue when it came to finding talent. Uniqueness meant that finding highly specialized people was almost impossible, so I had to rely on other methods.
   * My solution: Employ people who show high generalized creative and analytical skills, then teach them to do the exact work - instead of relying on employing the experts in the field who were too few and too expensive. Made it easier to find new talent, but more time consuming and required more dedicated training.
* **I had to raise prices (otherwise I'd drown), and this brought 3 issues:**
   * a) Selling became harder. $1000 for multi-platform work was a no-brainer for most people interested in my services. Change that to $2000+ per platform, and suddenly you'll find yourself looking at weeks of internal consideration by the prospects before they even give you a definite yes or no. Plus, you'll flat out sell less.
   * b) If you're selling your work for much lower than the market average (even in my scenario with unique services, there *was* an estimated market average), barely anyone asks for case studies, numbers, or proof of work. I remember getting so used to the relaxing meetings where I'd sell in the first 15 minutes, and then spend the rest of the time just chatting with the new client about some unrelated stuff. Once you raise the prices, suddenly you'll find yourself spending 45 minutes explaining every itty bitty detail about the work you do and showing proof, testimonials, and recommendations. Oh, and prospects *will* reach out to the people in your testimonials, so don't even think about faking them.
   * c) You're now competing with the bigger fish. One thing nobody taught you when you were starting was that the price brackets were real. The moment you raise your prices and cross into the next price bracket, even by a cent, you're competing with the more established, better organized, and better backed-up companies. As a small company with dirt low prices, you were like a puppy that everyone wanted to help out. Sure, they'll let you bring the newspaper every morning for a few pennies, and no, it's not a problem if it ends up a little wet. But now, you're a grown up dog with a few scars on your face and everyone's expecting real, hard-proven value from you. You'll have to bark at the mailman, bring the newspaper without a single drop on it, and be ready to play whenever that's expected from you. Oh, and before that, you'll have to convince everyone why it's better to adopt you rather than a highly-trained veteran who already knows every mailman by their scent from a mile away.
* **Organization**
   * By this time, you already need to hire an all-around HR who can handle hiring & onboarding processes during the hiring times, and people management during the times when you're not hiring. You also need to find the best tools to organize your work because there's too many people and too many projects to keep track of yourself. I tried multiple because one wasn't enough - Notion worked really well for compiling and organizing raw data, Google Sheets were awesome for keeping track of clients and campaigns because of their simplistic, very clear design, and ChatGPT helped with structuring and automating some parts of the operations.
   * Legal, Financial, and Administrative advisors are a MUST. Find the best ones you can afford and ask for a long-term subscription where they'd help with any legal documents, financial advising, and administrative tasks when needed, but since you won't have them all the time, you'll pay a lower subscription price.
* **Surviving your growth**
   * As you can imagine, all of these raise your company's expenses a lot. It's not as simple as subtracting a few salaries and taxes from your total revenue now; **YOU NEED** financial optimization. Understanding how to do things cheaper, what to pay for and what to do yourself, and ultimately, minimizing the expenses while retaining the quality is crucial.
   * I managed to save about $4000 on revamping my website and service deck by hiring designers from Devoted Fusion (they were also kind enough to lend me a programmer from their main company, Devoted Studios, who helped with improving and optimizeing the code on the website), figuring out the right prompting strategy with ChatGPT, to finally using all of that and create a website with Lovable AI instead of paying for one. It cost me about 20 hours of work in total (mind that I would have to spend at least 10 hours anyway compiling all the data for the website and doing the copywriting) to build a website from scratch. Just 10 hours of extra work to save $4000+. ChatGPT helped me with the strategy and the right prompts, and I hired a talented designer from Devoted Fusion who helped with the logo and the website's overall design. Then Lovable did all the manual lifting for me and put together a website that, after about 400 prompts, looked exactly the way I wanted it to.
* **High-level decisions**
   * Do you stay in the same industry and expand by adding different services/products to your deck, or commit to your main few services/products but expand to other industries? Do you employ AI tools/agents to cover and automatize some of the work, or rely on adding more employees? Is the industry you're part of sinking without a sign that it'll get better soon, or is it just starting to grow? And in regards to this - should you stick to the industry so once it starts growing you already have established reputation and renown; or you pivot to a different industry? Do you sacrifice your health yet again and push harder just that one more time to reach a goal? And if so, what's the threshold after which your health will be sacrtificed so many times that you'll have to take some time off?

**All of these made me realize that, while it's often considered that the real testament of a company is how it survived the Startup Phase, the second part - Expansion - is actually the most important (and the most stressful) one**. My health deteriorated during this period under the sheer weight of all the responsibilities and the stress that was coming with them; and the worst part is - people barely mention that.

**When you're just starting a company, you're excited, motivated, fresh, and probably coming from a more or less healthy spot**. These psychological and biological factors play a crucial role in your ability to handle responsibilities - you're more resistant to stress, less likely to blow up because of a minor issue that reappeared yet again, and overall more excited to do your work. 12-hour working days? You bet it. Weeks or even months during which your company is your main and only focus? Say no more.

On the other hand, **after 3 years, it's very likely that your motivation won't be as high as it used to be, you'll be more worn out both mentally and physically**. Daily stress won't just be a nuisance you signed up for when starting a company, but a ticking bomb in your head.

However, there are also some beautiful things about entrepreneurship at this stage. First of all, **once you've reached that Expansion stage, you'll feel like a goddamn king of the world**. You officially made it, you managed to grow a successful and growing business, and you're making enough to live a comfortable life. Great job!

You've also developed dozens of very useful skills that will always be of value, and you've learned a few things about succeeding in life. People from your industry respect you, you have partners and friends who speak highly of you and your business, and generally, yo feel like you're doing the right thing... because you are!

# Closing Insights

**Entrepreneurship will cost you a lot**. More than most people can even imagine, and definitely more than anyone realizes when they're first starting. But it also gives a lot.

**I am an entrepreneur**. I was born with entrepreneurship in my veins, I couldn't hold a regular job for more than two months, and couldn't ever imagine being stuck in an office for 40 years... or until I die, hopefully earlier than that. Sometimes, I question my decision and envy not being able to finish my work at 5 in the afternoon, and just forget about it until tomorrow morning. I envy not being able to have a coffee with my friends when I want, chit chat about random, daily happenings, and go back home to watch a movie. But then I realize that no hobby, no coffee with friends, and no movies could make me feel the way building my own business does. The life of an entrepreneur is built to look like a fairytale. It's not a fairytale for sure, even if you're successful, but it's a damn fun journey that you'll eternally fall in love with.",40,1765237425.0,Entrepreneur,3,0.9,False

Nothing serious, like coffee, a concert, and practice. This dude has been way more intense than the situation calls for. I mean, he's a love bomber.  

He used the word love almost immediately and startled sending me lovey gifs and reels.  He pre purchased movie tickets before I even knew if I could go, then kept pushing after I said I was busy. Every time I set a simple plan, he tried to turn it into more. He checked the parking lot for our league (he had to check to see if it was plowed) on my side of town and called to say he was waiting there until I was ready to see him. A normal conversation about furniture shopping somehow became him trying to come over to my place even though I had said I wasn’t feeling well and was staying in. Then he showed up at my house unexpectedly with soup another time and expected me to answer the door. This was after I told him I have a history with being stalked and do not accept surprise visits. He also tried to insert himself into my Thanksgiving plans. All of it felt way too fast and way too intrusive. I've told him to chill out multiple times. I can't help but feel he is actually just manipulative. Then I think maybe he's just really bad at this and has no idea what a mature relationship is? 

He also brings up his ex constantly and talks about not dating for years like it is an accomplishment. To me, it reads as someone who has not moved on.

I told him I didn’t think we should talk anymore. He called me later, crying, and read a long love letter to me. I didn’t know how to respond in that moment, so the conversation hasn’t actually been ended yet. We agreed to talk in person because we have to see each other and I wanted to keep things civil. When we met, he brought an actual list of talking points. It was unsettling.

I’m not saying I think he’d hurt me, but the combination of emotional intensity, boundary crossing, pressure, and now this dramatic reaction has me feeling uneasy. I still have to see him weekly, and part of me is dreading his reaction when I end it for real.

I’m building a new coffee brand right here in India called **Brew0**.  
The mission: **coffee that actually tastes like coffee**, especially when you’re traveling or away from your gear.

No syrups.  
No “mystery flavours.”  
No burnt bitterness.  
Just **good coffee, fast**.

Before we finalize production, I’d love feedback from the people who care about coffee *way more than the average mortal* — **you** 😄

So here’s the plan:  
👉 I’ll send out a **limited number of free samples**  
👉 You taste it at home or on a trip  
👉 You tell me honestly what’s good / bad / needs fixing

  
Trying two roast profiles:  
• **Strong** – dark roast, high punch  
• **Smooth** – medium roast, cleaner sweetness

If you’re interested:  
Just comment with **Strong** or **Smooth** — and I’ll DM you for details.  
(Bangalore only for now — shipping will eat me alive otherwise 😅)

Also, any quick feedback on this idea would help:  
🗯 What do you *hate most* about instant coffee right now?  
🧳 Do you carry coffee when you travel? What format?

Here’s the website if you’re curious (not selling anything today):  
[**www.brew0.com**](http://www.brew0.com)

Thanks for being real — roast my product harder than a French roast if needed 🔥☕

I have to kill them, if such a thing is even possible.","Before you contact the police, you need to know that my job isn’t normal. I never applied for it. I can’t tell anyone about it. And if I try to quit, my bosses will kill me. So I’ve decided to beat them at their own game. While reading this story, you might find my bosses likable. Funny. Charming, as those old bastards would say. But don't let them fool you. Believe me, the world will be much better off without them. 

I guess I should begin with how I became the unfortunate hero of this story. It all started, as so many terrible things do, with a Tinder date.

I’ve never been a good-looking guy. I’m well aware that self-deprecation is somewhat expected for this website, but it’s true. The only person who ever called me handsome is my Nana. My single attractive trait is that I’m taller than average. But that’s balanced out my physique, which could best be described as “a scarecrow on Ozempic.” Worst of all, my vision is so bad that I need Coke-bottle glasses in order to see more than a foot away.

After I moved to Pittsburgh for college, I went my entire freshman year without attempting to date anyone. Some of my friends, concerned for my wellbeing, convinced me to sign up for Tinder. I was unsure of it, at first. I thought Tinder was a site for hookups, and I’m more of a romantic. But since my friends insisted that this was the path to love, I relented. The first few dates I went on were fine- not great, but not disastrous enough to post to Reddit. I was about to give up when I matched with Daisy.

I was shocked that she swiped right on me at all. Daisy was very pretty- in other words, way out of my league. Second of all, when she messaged me, she was super chatty and enthusiastic. She was eighteen, grew up in London, and loved reading and going to museums and concerts. She was super excited to meet me and made this clear with multiple exclamation points and emojis. Though I was almost certain she was a catfish, I couldn’t pass up a chance to go on a date.

We ate dinner at a restaurant near campus. I was shocked to find out that Daisy was even more beautiful in person. She had a heart-shaped face with huge, ice-blue eyes. She was short, but had the sort of hourglass figure rarely seen outside of Hollywood. She had put her curly, light blonde hair in a high ponytail and wore a baby blue sundress. The only unattractive thing about her was that she was really pale- her skin was literally the color of milk. It was like she’d never gone outside in her life.

When she first saw me I braced for her disappointed reaction, but there was none. Her face broke out into a massive smile, like I was the most handsome guy she’d even seen. She spoke with a British accent that made her sound posh, like a character from *Pride and Prejudice.* Throughout dinner, she talked constantly, asking about where I’m from, what I was studying, my hobbies. She seemed genuinely interested in me, more so than any other girl I’d ever talked to. I was so excited that I failed to notice she was learning way more about me than I was about her.

After she generously offered to pay for both our meals (good thing, too, because she ate twice as much as I did), she offered to take me back to her place. I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised- I did meet her on Tinder, after all- but in my experience, girls like Daisy were rarely so forward. Still, I jumped at the opportunity. At that point, I was putty in her hands.

Our Uber took us to a part of the city known as Squirrel Hill. It’s a well-kept neighborhood with nice houses and manicured lawns. Some of those houses are huge- more like mansions. I always assumed they were bed and breakfasts or luxury apartments. So you could imagine my surprise when the Uber pulled up to one of the biggest houses there. It was made entirely of white stone, with massive columns and a fountain in the front driveway. Half the facade was covered in ivy, but the rest of the property was immaculate.

Daisy got out and stood on the driveway, staring at the night sky. The usual Pittsburgh clouds had dispersed, and a full moon glared down at her like a gigantic spotlight. “What a beautiful moon,” she said, maybe just to herself.

I was still gawking at the house. “You’re… renting a room here?”

Daisy began moving up the drive. “No,” she said, still smiling, “This is my entire house.”

Jesus. Pretty, nice, and filthy rich? There had to be a catch. But Daisy had already disappeared through the front door, and I found myself following behind like a lovesick puppy.

The inside of the house was just as fancy as the outside. Victorian-style furniture, shining hardwood floors, Renaissance paintings. We passed by a room with the door slightly ajar, and I glimpsed a library with bookshelves up to the ceiling.

She led me not into her bedroom, but her “parlor.” I guess that’s rich-British-people-talk for “fancy living room.” It was just as exquisitely decorated as the rest of the house. I sank down on the tiny sofa, awkwardly trying to arrange my long legs, not really sure of what to do. Fortunately, or as I would soon learn, unfortunately, Daisy made the first move.

Daisy grabbed my hand. Her hand was freezing, and between that and how pale it was, I was hit with the sensation that I was holding hands with a corpse. But that was ridiculous. Maybe she just had poor circulation. 

She had never stopped smiling. Her teeth were tiny, perfectly straight and white. “I’m so glad you’re here, Elliot.”

“So am I,” I replied stupidly.

She moved closer to me, so that her shoulder was right against mine. Even through her dress and my button-down shirt, her skin was ice cold. “You’re a pretty good-looking fellow,” she was saying. 

“You’re joking,” I chuckled. 

“I’m not.” She used a slender finger to tilt my head her way. “I don’t have much experience with American boys. I didn’t realize they could be so-” she stopped, her blue eyes going vacant for a split second- “warm.”

“You’re so cold,” I mumbled.

I think she was saying, “Help me change that,” but at that point, her lips were already against mine.

In short, we started making out. I’ll spare you the details, except the most essential: we started on the tiny sofa, and wound up with my back against the wall opposite the door. At some point, I lost my glasses. I was so… um, *preoccupied…* that when I felt Daisy pulling down my collar and sinking her teeth into my neck, I thought she was just getting kinky.

But Daisy’s nibbles turned into bites, and her bites started to hurt. Not in a sexy way- it felt more like she had taken a scalpel to the skin below my jaw. *Shit. Did we agree on a safe word?* I tried to tell her to stop, but something red shot across my vision. Daisy shrieked as it splattered across her face. Blood. My blood. I held a hand to my neck and felt the blood shooting out like from a fountain, in time with each of my heartbeats. Some of the spurts made it halfway across the room.

With each spurt of blood I felt weaker. My already blurry vision was becoming downright foggy. I tried to speak, but the sound that came out was a mix between a groan and a gurgle. I tried to move, but wound up falling backwards against the wall and slumping to the floor. Daisy was speaking quickly, in the breathy, high-pitched voice that I found so cute just a few minutes ago. She looked panicked, but wasn’t making an effort to stop the bleeding or call 911. Her big blue eyes had gone enormous with fear. Like the song… *Her hair is Harlow gold… Her lips sweet surprise… Her hands are never cold..* Not this girl! I tried to laugh, but only heard myself make gurgling sounds.

A man appeared in the room. And I do mean appeared: the door never opened, he just materialized from under the door frame, surrounded by mist. His entire figure was blurry, but he seemed tall and athletic-looking. “Daisy!” he bellowed, in a similar accent, “What have you done?”

Daisy flew over to where the man was standing. I mean, literally *flew*: I saw her feet leave the floor in front of me. She glided towards him and continued floating in the air, so she could be at his eye level. 

“I’m so sorry, Lord Cyrus,” she was saying, “Everything was going so well! It was just supposed to be a regular feeding. I don’t know what happened!” She sounded genuinely upset.

“You’ve missed the jugular and bitten his carotid artery. 200 years of this, and you still can’t tell the difference. Now you’ve gotten blood all over the furniture. And your dress is ruined- I bought that for you a fortnight ago!”

*Fortnight?* Was this guy a *Bridgerton* character?

At this point I was lying on the floor, in a puddle of my own blood. The blood was still shooting out, but weaker. I took in the sights around me. There was a massive potted ficus on my left. An elaborately carved coffee table to my right. The wallpaper was cream in color, with a small but exquisite floral pattern. Even the ceiling was carved with a design, although at that point I could barely see it. I was about to experience one of the most embarrassing deaths imaginable, but at least I’d die someplace nice. It was a beautiful room to die in.

Daisy began to whimper. The man sighed. “I suppose it’s alright. Anyone can make mistakes. We’ll just throw him in the incinerator and start cleaning up.”

Although I was dying, the mention of an incinerator sent a wave of panic through me. I tried to scream but only gurgled and retched up some more blood. 

Daisy and the man stopped talking and turned to look at me. “My God…” the man said, “He’s still *alive?*”

He walked over and bent down to look at me, Daisy following close behind. I couldn’t make out his face, but his tone was even, analytical. “He *is* alive. Barely. I should snap the poor bastard’s neck and put him out of his misery.” I tried to protest, but only managed a moan and a wiggle.

“No!” shrieked Daisy. “This is a sign! He’s not like other mortals. He’s special. Can we keep him, Lord Cyrus? Please, please, please?” She was bobbing up and down in the air.

“And do *what* with him, exactly?”

“He could be my familiar! I haven’t had a familiar in so long! Can I please have him?”

*What the fuck is a familiar?* Before I could hear any more, everything went black.



I woke up to fluorescent lights and the sound of a beeping monitor. The metallic taste of blood still hung in my acrid mouth. Looking around, I realized I was in a hospital bed. There was a large bandage on my neck, right where Daisy had bitten me. Someone came up to me and handed me my glasses. Once I put them on, I realized, to my horror, who the person was.

“Good afternoon,” said Lord Cyrus. “Mr. Grant, is it?”

He came around and sat on the edge of my bed. He was tall and broad-shouldered, with thick black hair and the most vivid green eyes I had even seen. He looked to be in his early thirties. His skin was bronze, with a washed-out, almost grayish undertone that made him look somewhat sickly. He wore a suit that probably cost more than my tuition. Like Daisy, he was good-looking, but in a different way. Older, more worldly, more dangerous. While Daisy sparkled, Lord Cyrus smoldered.

Daisy, meanwhile, was hovering near the ceiling, reading a copy of *Sharp Objects*. When she saw I was awake, she dropped the book onto a chair and perched on my footboard like a gargoyle.

“Umm…” I mumbled, still slightly groggy, “Just call me... Elliot is fine.”

“You’re quite the survivor, aren’t you?” said Lord Cyrus, “You really ought to have bled out in the parlor. I wanted to snap your neck and be done with it, but Daisy took a liking to you.”

Daisy’s smile grew eerily wide. I noticed that her canine teeth were long and sharp. They didn’t look like that before. 

Lord Cyrus continued, “I’ve taken the liberty of paying your hospital bill.”

“Gee… thanks.” What could I say when his little friend put me in the hospital to begin with? “How did you explain what happened to my neck?”

He said matter-of-factly, “You and Daisy were being… intimate, when you fell against the wall and pierced your neck with a protruding nail.”

“What?” I exclaimed, “That’s the best you come up with?” In addition to trying to kill me, these two probably turned me into the laughingstock of the Pittsburgh medical system.

He shrugged. “The point is, Elliot, we kept you alive for a specific purpose. Daisy-”

She interjected, “I want you to become my familiar!”

“A familiar,” Lord Cyrus explained, “is a bit like a personal assistant. You will serve as Daisy’s companion, chaperone, and valet.” He must have seen the horrified expression on my face, because he added, “You will be paid, of course. We don’t believe in slave labor.”

Maybe it was the usual hospital chill, but I started trembling. “For how long?”

“As long as Daisy wants.”

“And if I refuse?” I asked, though I already suspected the answer.

“Daisy tears open your stitches and finishes her meal, and we make it look like an accident.”

Daisy, still perched on the footboard, made her blue eyes go huge and wide, pleading with me. Puppy-dog eyes, like my mom would say. Her canine teeth were normal now. I guess she could grow and retract her teeth at will, like a cat’s claws. She looked adorable, like the innocent, happy girl I found the restaurant. Who could guess this was the face of a monster?

My trembling turned to shaking. The wound on my neck throbbed with pain, as if anticipating what Daisy could do. The horrible things these two could do to me… I hated them, for pretending they were giving me a choice, for feigning generosity. This wasn’t a job offer so much as a deal with the devil. Those always ended the same: another soul dragged to the bottom of Hell.

Of course I said yes. What other choice did I have? 

“One more thing,” I added. “*What* are you two?”

“Why, Elliot,” Daisy replied. Her fangs grew back, and when Lord Cyrus smiled, I could see he had a pair of his own. “What do you think?”

Seven years later, and I still cannot put into words how desperately I wanted to scream.

1phrz53,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1phrz53/cant_record_customer_support/,Can’t record customer support,"I have a TBI and can’t recall crap. I record phone calls when I call customer support so I have audible proof of what was said. I live in a one party consent state, so I do not have to disclose I’m recording. Plus they are recording me.

Today Amazon was going to charge me for an item that was returned at beginning of November. I had them call me, when I answered I hit the button top left of iPhone to start the recording.

I heard the audible message that the call would be recorded. Then immediately it stopped recording and said recording stopped. I hit the button two more times with same results.

I have never had that happen before. Is this a problem with my iPhone, or does Amazon have something to try and prevent us from recording their lousy customer service?

I was given a receipt by UPS showing I sent the package. Amazon sent a refund and acknowledged my return. On the phone today I was told I see you returned on 11/3 but we haven’t received it yet, so if I return it before 12/18 you won’t be charged again.

Did she even listen to herself? How do I return an item that you just verified I sent back.

She had to put me on hold to talk to her supervisor to clear the pending charge. More likely she needed a coffee refill.

Since I wasn’t able to record the call as far as she thought, I made her send an email as my proof.

I did record using Record It! Is there an app that just does voice and not video as well when this happens?

I wanted to push myself and try to not go down in springs (if I am able to). I feel like Im surprising myself with how far I want to take my body! Specially since dropping energy drinks/coffee.

Also, after plateauing in weight for almost 2 years year, Im happy to mention that I dropped 11 pounds! I think I am gaining a lot of muscle bc I measured myself and my waist is the same size as when I was 15 pounds less, which is throwing me off lol 

I also sauna, have one of those heating pads for my shoulders, back, and legs, and I stretch a bunch. And of course I eat a lot of protein and drink plenty of water.

1phrwsm,https://i.redd.it/mp3oigaje26g1.jpeg,Just bought a 23MX hardware 4.,"I just picked this up last week. I've been in the market in the north east for couple months now. Seems like the demand for used model x's sky rocketed in the past couple months. Not many for sale within 200 miles of me. Alot of them were rebuilt titles. Soon as a low milage 23+ was up for sale, it sold in a week or two.

A 2024 Model x came up forsale 12 miles from me. Two days later I decided to go look at it. When I got to the dealer, they said it sold already. The sales man said they got 40+ phone calls for it.

So finally, Wednesday before thanksgiving. A listing on auto trader came up with a 2023 x with 15k miles. No color or price information. Just the Vin that confirmed it was a hardware 4. So friday morning I call the dealer to confirm the car. They said it was black with cream interior. I said ok im coming to look at it. When I got there, it ended up being a 7seater which was a huge plus. I ended up buying it for $51,000. (Which I thought was a steal)

I owned Audi's, BMW m5, camaro, Porsche. This car is the coolest car I ever owned. I'm a big syfy guy and love anything future based. This car is it.

Sound system a 10. I've had bower Wilkins in my bmw and this system tops it.

I love the windshield. I always hated having a moon roof above me but never being able to see out of it from the driver's seat without breaking my neck.

Car drives great. It has a yoke that I thought I wouldn't like. But I like how you can see the screen alot easier with it.

I give the suspension a 7. I assumed with the 22inch wheels, it would have a rougher ride and accepted it. Its nothing like my wife's BMW IX suspension. You literally don't feel anything in that car.

I subscribed to FSD for the first time. It gave me version 13.2.9. It's amazing how good it is. I'm shocked on decisions this car makes. It's funny when it stops for a pedestrian in a crosswalk and the pedestrian waves at me but it wasn't me that let them cross the road.

It's very cool to have a cup of coffee and have the car drive me around town. You can't get any more futuristic than that.

1phrud6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenNoCensor/comments/1phrud6/is_it_ever_ok_to_randomly_compliment_a_woman/,Is it ever ok to randomly compliment a woman (stranger) as a man?,"So I was in line to get my coffee and the woman in front of me (looked early 20s, I am 18) was wearing a hockey jacket of an NHL team.

Hockey is super unpopular where I live and whenever we see someone else wearing hockey merch or somehow showing that they are a hockey fan, we always give a little heads up like ""nice I see ya"" kinda thing. 

Our city has a very small but tight knit and close passionate hockey community. (I am pretty sure the only hockey fans in my city are the few Canadian immigrants like myself lol but this girl was wearing the jacket of an American team)


There are barely any hockey fans where I live let alone female hockey fans so I was super stoked to see one. I wanted to say ""Hey, nice jacket"" but decided against it.

I always hear and understandably so how scared women are when a man approaches them or talks to them in public. And that's just for being talked to, let alone when a random man gives you a compliment. And to make it even worse, I am a teenage boy and we don't exactly have the best reputation right now and deservedly so. 

She is also black in an all white town so I wasn't sure if that would make it even more uncomfortable for her. I am a visible constantly discriminated against minority (although obviously not as much as women) but I am still a white male so I doubt that would have made it seem less scary for her.

I decided no amount of goodness (idk what other word to use) she could feel from finding another hockey fan would be worth it for the initial fright she would feel from a random teenage boy talking to her.

I think I did the right thing not saying anything but part of me regrets it and even feels a bit sexist as I did technically not talk to her just because she was a woman, even if the reasons were more complex than that. Did I make the right choice? Is there anything I can know and learn from this? Thank you!

*\*keyboard clicking sounds and light Christmas music can be heard on an overhead speaker\**

Ah, this is the fifth time this song has played since I’ve gotten here at work. I wish they would put it on a different station already.  I know they want to have everyone in the Christmas spirit, but if I got a raise, I would be much more inclined to being Holly and Jolly.  *\*keyboard clicks and high heel footsteps\**

Oh, Hey there Sandy, what’s up? Are you for real? We are doing a secret Santa gift exchange this year? \**Jingles the bowl with names in it*\* I see \**light chuckle\** Can I get a pass? I’m just kidding, here let me pick out my name. Yeah, I know the rules, keep it a secret and no changing.  What’s the price range this year? At least 20?  \**footsteps as she walks away\** Thanks there, Sandy. \**annoyed sigh\** Great another thing this company does that attempts to promote synergy. Well, let’s see who I got this year. \**unfolding the paper sounds\** Oh no. no. Not her. Wha-I. No.

*\*footsteps of sneakers\** Oh Hey Max! Hi, hmm did you already pick for the secret Santa? Yeah, did you already buy your gift?  Oh, come on, that’s just some silly rule of Sandy’s of course we can exchange names. **(anxious tone)** Tell me who you got. Oh, that’s worse than the new girl. *\*laughter*\* Yea laugh it up. No, don’t bring Jerry over here. Yes Jerry, I got the new girl, who did you get? Perfect! Change with me! You already brought your gift? Damnit! Come on Jer, I thought you were on my side here.  I don’t even know what she likes and she is kind of weird. In a nice way I’m sure. Get to know her? Yeah, that won’t be suspicious at all. (**mocking tone)** ‘Hello there, can you tell me what you’d like for a gift? Why? Oh no reason.’ (**back to normal tone**) She wouldn’t think that was weird at all. Come on. There’s no way I can go do that and you know that. Either give me ideas or, more preferably, change with me. Oh, come on guys! You’re killing me here! \**laughter as they walk away\** Yeah thanks for nothing.

*\*Keyboard clicking, light Christmas music, and then it’s lunch time, in the breakroom\**

Hey there, Manda. Hmm, question for you. What would you get for someone you didn’t really know but had to? (**annoyed tone)** Oh, Max told you already huh? Yeah, I got the new girl. I have no clue what to get for her and, you being a girl, well maybe you can give me an idea…..please? Get to know her? Man, what is up with everyone today. It’s like the universe is trying to set us up or what? That’s what the guys said too.*\*sighs*\* I don’t want to. Why? Because she like …just look at her. \**longer pause\** Don’t give me that look, please. I’m sure she is nice and all but I’m not looking for anything like that right now and especially not with someone who looks like a bookworm. I’m a man’s man, you know. Complete opposite and don’t give me that crap that opposites attract okay. I’m just not looking right now alright, case closed, end of discussion. Now if you please, what would you get her if you had her? No clue? Well \**cleans up wrappers\** (**sarcastic tone**) Thanks Mand, per usual as the HR department is, you have been so helpful here.

*Setting: \*you go back to your desk and finish up the work day then go to the stores, door opens\**

Hmm. Now what to get for her. She doesn’t seem like the type of girl that likes sweets, so candy is out of the question. I’m sure she doesn’t drink at all so there goes every choice of alcohol. She is not twelve even though she sometimes dresses like it, so plushies are a no, and there is no way I’m not going to send any wrong signals with flowers. If I got her a bubble bath kit would that make me seem like a jerk? Probably, someone would say I thought she smelt bad.  Hmmm. Think, think. \**footsteps while walking around the store\** I know she reads, I’ve seen her on her lunch break doing that, but I don’t know what she likes. \**chuckles\** Watch she probably one of those secret booktok girlies, reading smut while at work. Though that does put her in a new light if she did that-- I would give her credit. \**more footsteps*\* Does she like to bake? Would a baking kit be alright? Is it sexist? A little. *\*annoyed sigh*\* Why is this so hard!?  I should just get a gift card and be done with it. Yeah gift card, everyone loves money. There, gift gotten, don’t have to worry about it anymore now.

*Setting: The party*

Hey! Yeah, Happy Holidays to you too. Why yes I would love a drink, thanks Jer. Yeah well you know how it is. *\*glass dinging sounds*\* Ah yes, Sandy’s Holiday Speech and the exchange. Did you rob a bank, it was only supposed to be 20 dollars Jer? You made your gift? I didn’t know you knitted, and it’s for Manda. \**opening sounds\** Wow that’s …that really nice and more thoughtful than what I got.  Oh? My gift for the new girl? You know, it’s great, I figured it out, haha. Tsk, how did you know Manda? Were you spying on me? It’s not my fault! You gave me no ideas at all! Either one of you! *\*light footsteps and a tap on the shoulder\**

Oh, Hello there! The new girl! Well I guess you are not that new haha. Oh you had me. **(To self: I bet Sandy had this planned the whole time**) Oh thanks, sure I’ll open it. \**sounds of opening up the gift*\* Wow, this is such a thoughtful gift. I love it, thank you. It’s like you knew what I wanted without knowing what I wanted. Oh, yeah, hmm I had you but I didn’t know what you would have liked. \**pause*\* You get that a lot? Oh I’m sorry. I guess I should have taken the advice of the others and tried to get to know you. You like to read and bake? Hah, I was going to get you a baking kit, but I thought it might be a little hmm weird. I’d like to get you something else now. I feel really bad, I just got a gift card. *\*pause*\* Haha, yeah I guess that is something you would get someone you have no clue. You have no hard feelings. I still would like to make it up to you. Yeah, okay. Coffee sometime sounds great. See you around. Bye. \**light footsteps walk away\**

1phrtcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1phrtcb/feel_like_i_dont_deserve_any_love_from_allah/,Feel Like I Don’t Deserve Any Love From Allah,"I just needed to get this off my chest because my heart has been so heavy lately.

A bit about my situation: I spent over a year desperately looking for a job. During that time, people kept telling me, “Don’t miss your prayers. Ask Allah for what you want.” So I did. I cried to Him, I begged Him for help, and SubhanAllah,  He opened a door for me. I finally got my first real job, and I absolutely loved it. My SVP was incredibly kind, work was going great, and life finally felt like it was falling into place.

But as things got better, I slowly started slipping. I got so busy that I stopped prioritizing Allah the way I should have. I’d pray Fajr before work, then make excuses throughout the day, “I’m busy, I’ll pray later.” I kept delaying and delaying until I wasn’t praying properly at all.

Fast forward to the last couple weeks: I got my annual raise, and alhamdulillah it was great, even higher than others. But they still refused to promote me or pay me what my work was worth. My SVP would always tell me, “You’re too smart for this job. You need to find something better.” So I finally spoke up and asked the Presidents for better compensation.
They were furious. A couple days later, they told my SVP they were posting my job online and planning to fire me. To make things worse, HR is basically sleeping with the President, so my SVP told me honestly, “It’s better to leave now with your dignity and references intact than to let them push you out and make your life miserable.”

So I resigned.

And I can’t lie… it broke me. It genuinely felt like Allah lifted me up just to put me back down, and a big part of me keeps thinking, maybe I deserved this for neglecting Him. Now that I’m praying all my prayers again, every time I make dua, all I can say is, “Allah, please forgive me.” I feel ashamed even asking Him for help because I’ve said so many times that I’d do better, and then I didn’t.

But even now… today I had a coffee chat, and it went well. And when I walked home afterward, I started crying because despite everything, Allah is still helping me. He is still sending me opportunities. He is still guiding me, even though I feel I’ve let Him down so many times.

I just don’t know the best way to repent. I don’t know how to stop feeling like I failed Allah. I want to be better. I want to turn back completely and sincerely.

Ya Allah, please forgive me. Please give me strength. Please make this hardship a path back to You and not a punishment. And if this is a test, help me pass it. Help me grow from it. Help me get through it.

If anyone has advice on how to truly repent and rebuild your connection with Allah after slipping so many times… I’d really appreciate it. I’m just trying to find my way again.",3,1765236286.0,islam,1,1.0,False

1phrrdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1phrrdh/something_i_wrote_earlier_today/,something i wrote earlier today :),"The conversation is as follows: a man with tattoos covering his forearms, a well-lined beard, a cap on backwards, middle-aged and Latino, sitting opposite a woman, glasses, neat hair, seated at a table thirty centimetres away at best in what is an already intimate diner, and they first talk of their past binging disorders and habits. Both of them find solace in balls of yarn because they distract them from (neither of them call it by this name) “food noise.” They talk of the season, of being indoors. She talks of cooking with other people and she sips her coffee. He talks of knitting at home, and petting his dog. His relationship with his dog has changed, as his dog now trusts him enough to roll on his back and bare his stomach for the man to pet. Is it a new dog? Maybe. He says something else, and it seems like this was a dog he had with his partner.

His ex-partner. The woman catches this thread, and they start talking about the man’s ex-boyfriend (they don’t call him that or by his name, only as his ex-partner). He might have left in August? They ascribe a certain sinister nature to how the ex-partner treated the dog, specifically in how he fed it, though it’s only a vague allusion. He wishes (he calls him by a name now, an abbreviation of two-letters incredibly common for Quebecois men) could have seen him yesterday with his (formerly their?) dog, specifically how close they had become. Both of them suspected that his ex-boyfriend would simply turn his nose up at the situation, that he would simply be aloof to it even if it had happened while they were together. Evidently, this was not a good break-up, not that there ever is any such thing. There are no “good break-ups,” only ever amicable ones.

They both take turns talking of partners, of how both of them had ex-partners (only ever that word, “partner) who lacked the ability to “properly” communicate, of the boundaries they set that were not respected. In every story we tell, there is an impulse to write ourselves as perfect victims, for that is where true virtue lies. But they allude to their own imperfections, and in so doing, are made imperfect victims, where virtue lies even higher. There was one thorn that stuck out — the seed imbibed in every break-up that the man let slip. The end of any relationship will almost always lead to one or both parties invoking this near-prayer that he invoked, either as soon as the break-up ends, time after it ends, and sometimes even before it ends, this near-prayer of “If only he could see me now.” This near-prayer takes a few different hues. There is the spite-driven hue, that hue of showing the person who you are no longer with how much better you are without them. The person lacked patience, and if they had given you time, it would have worked out. The kinks would have been straightened out, because they were being worked out at that time (this is often contrary to reality, and the kinks only make themselves known later). Time, and the lack of patience in its face, was the reason that the relationship fell apart. A perfect scapegoat.

This man was not expressing any element of spite. A slight cattiness, at worst, but he was entirely too sweet, and the hue of his near-prayer was not a spiteful one, but a hopeful one, one that betrays an expression of one of our core anxieties, even outside of relationships, the fact that we are seldom ready to meet a moment when it comes, that we are almost always the people we need to be to meet catastrophe after it has struck us. Spite, and hope. They are both different hues and yet they are both bitter fruit of the same mournful tree. The spiteful invocation is angry, and just as sad as the hopeful one, just as indicative of the grip one still holds on what they have let slip.

“If only they could see me now.” We want to be seen now because we assume we have seen the whole picture after the fact. We have performed the autopsy, we have gone over the books and logged the checks and the balances and accounted for everything, and equipped with this new found “full picture” we want the fabled “second chance.” (If presented with the second chance, you often realise how near you are to the person who you were then, and are likely to carry out the same mistake or find yourself at the same point via a new equally ill-fated route). “If only they could see me now.” We want to be seen now and in so doing we pick at scabs because we want to return to unmarred skin, because it is a good form of self-delusion or self-punishment. “If only they could see me now.” We want to be seen now because we assume that the us of now, put in that same precarious position that was crumbling for many reasons, would not be reciting this prayer.

Rather, the us of now would be too preoccupied with their lips locked to the lips of love lost to form the words that recite that mournful prayer.",5,1765236147.0,redscarepod,7,0.78,False

1phrn0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1phrn0w/endgame_advice_temp_stable_pid_fast_between/,Endgame advice: temp stable (pid); fast between brew-steam (only drink w milk),"Currently enjoying a used Silvia. A tank. Build quality is a pleasure. But I basically make two milk drinks at the same time every morning at least once a day. None of us drink straight espresso. So:

1. Temp instability is painful. I could surf for one drink but then …

2. Time between brew and steam or steam and brew is painful after awhile. 

Rest of fam is both more frugal and less demanding and usually not making the coffee. I doubt agreement on any new roughly $2k machine. I do watch fb marketplace looking for an endgame or step up that addresses both temp stability (eg has pid) and brew/steam, simul or quicker. 

I found both the espresso and the milk significantly worse on the barista express so I would not go back there or too similar like the Bambino   

The thing that comes up used the most often that ticks both boxes is the Breville dual boiler. I’m not sure what people think about it in comparison with something with such greater build quality like the Silvia. I may have read that development of leaks is fairly common. I don’t know, what do people think?

I see very little otherwise that addresses both concerns. So I wonder whether switching to a more modern single boiler like the profitec go would do enough as far as brew and steam quickness to be worth the step? Or whether older.E61 machines without pid would offer enough temperature stability?",1,1765235836.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Every classic car has a story waiting to be told. This 1987 ford mustang sat patiently, weathered by time but holding onto the memories of open roads and weekend adventures.

When I first laid eyes on this ford, I saw what many would call a project car. But I saw something different - I saw potential. I saw the curves that made heads turn in its heyday. I saw the craftsmanship of an era when cars were built with pride.

Using AI-powered restoration analysis, I wanted to share what this beauty could become with the right care and dedication.

**MY NAME IS NAGUMO**

THREE DAYS.

**終末の前日**.

—————————


...I tumble through time after Night, colliding with a floating, ethereal object. It fuses into me, causing the loop to shrink, to contract, bursting and collapsing without reason. 

Something's wrong. A variable I didn't know, didn't notice. Whatever it is, it's agony. 

Sanctity low, Mental almost broken. Sinner Salt almost out: such things are necessary for a Stranger to use their abilities. Take it like this: Sinner Salt is the unique power inherent, and to use it one must use their minds, their Mental, and their Sanctity, the essential life force.

As I crash through time, loops begin to fade away. 

Night grabs my arm and tugs me through a closing window.

Without a word, I take out my gun.

So does she. 

The place where we are is turning a shade of red: clouds, I think they are, are splitting apart, becoming fleshy. 

Then it reveals itself: a sprawling gray scape of buildings. Strange. Foreign.

I expect Loop 201 to start. But it doesn't.

Somehow we're all alive: a crash registers me to the realization that the ship, and, inherentlt, the crew, live. Still falling and chasing me. Chasing Night. 

**How are they alive? Did something change? Come to think of it: what did I absorb earlier?**

**A presence, probably.**

**I don't know anymore. I'm just mindlessly chasing after a phantom. My head is in outer space, my body is elsewhere, only my determination is here at all.**

**I am nothing except determination. I am not chosen by any means of fate; fate does not choose, it happens.**

...

Lobo, through the twisted flow of this indescribable chaos, maneuvering his ship with great care, pierced into a calm sky that quickly plunged again to hellish conditions. He felt fear, yes, but despite such harsh conditions his heart had grown accustomed to that agonies: one can say that, to live on the sea, to flow along, is to become acquainted with the numerous and varied conditions which torment our spirits: of the encumbrances of physical and soulful nature we soon come to know as our most constant companion. 

Ice gently kept Odysseus's head down, her hand pressed against the back of it. He didn't object, really, but only grumbled slightly.

Ashes was beside Lobo as he helped steady the boy, hands on the shoulders. A pair of two eyes were needed for the excursion after their falling commander (and the mysterious shadow).

Doggo stood on the bow of the ship, arms crossed, staring the maelstrom in the eye (if his vegetable, leaf body had eyes). He casually looked at his map, before saying, ""wherever we are, Night better be alive.""

Section stepped beside him, calmly. The storm mattered nill to him. 

And Section spoke...

...

—————————

**MY NAME IS SECTION**


—If we are to perish amongst this strife let it be.—

—And so I say to Doggo on the deck of the 'ship', ""Are you scared of the uncertain?"".—

—He nods. Pensively. Sternly.—

—And so I say to him, ""there is nothing to fear: for to have faith in our good brothers and sisters we triumph over tribulations and evils; and if evil remains in our hearts we can see that although darkness is forever present, there is light as well.""—

—Ashes says to me, ""The fuck does that mean?"" As he cowers, takes cover from the danger of the intensified storm.—

—Thus I say to him, ""I decide to have faith. I ask of you the same. It's better to believe in something than nothing at all. There is always meaning, and it is only the mind that decides whether that is true or false.""—

—Ashes shrugs. ""Fair 'nough.""—

—The 'ship' of light lurches. I will describe it now to you. The ship of Lobo's mind is a creation that is idyllic. Strong bowed and good wood upon it possibly with the way of past-ing Adam and Eve's earliest conceiving present in the form-hull of the vessel.—

—We press onward, passing through nameless voids and lines, shifting into a station; train place of return, instead we return no more to anywhere.—

—Onward, onward! Have faith! Press on!—

—And so we do!—

—One can say even though we've passed through this storm, there will always be another. Time is not a flat plate that spins backwards and forwards: it spins in whatever direction it chooses.—

—Although I extol faith I confess I have none of it.—

—I feel stretched: thin, and with holes. I feel as if we've done this chase hundreds of times before. I'm going insane, aren't I? How fearful.—

—The body is three conjunctions of energies: Mental, Sanctity, and Heretic Salt. We are all born with abilities: to use and to increase the power of them we must sacrifice Mental, our stability, our understanding, our independence from time and space, and with Sanctity we sacrifice vitality. Heretic Salt is the channeling power: without it we cannot use our abilities. However that Salt destroys our place in the here and now. We become something of a past thing. Sometimes, Heretic Salt keeps memories alive, illusions of a person, as long as that person's memory exists in our minds. So, we don't know if half our group is **here**, or they've long since **died** and their memory is just here with us, corporeal.—

...

—————————

**MY NAME IS LOBO**. 


Did I tell you how much the sea tastes of salt? Salt of sea ever present yes, tasting in my mouth since I can recall, regrettably I have no liking to salty foods, a common courtesy of my graced mouth, aye, authority of the authentic culinary skills of Doggo who sprinkles heaps of SALT. 

The falling pumice substance from the torrent whirlpool of torrential potency descending unto us creates small holes in the air, difficult to breathe conditions and no longer safe. 

Follow, following without heed our captain falling, a beg of pardon to my poor english, an appartus of tongue like salt I see everywhere and I taste terribly of it unable to digest, aye, alas, one merely shifts through the substance that resembles sand. 

I be young, youngest in the group and half-a-height of most of em', learned my skills of talk from Section (goodman be praised), a medium difficulty of being intelligent in a group of halfwits and forlorn intellects, confess't methinks they have a problem.

Now we are chasing Night, I feel degrees of guilty as she leapt off my ship. Peril to the crew I see and I must focus to press on.

We land between a fake city and a reminiscent village-folk gathering (midsummer festivities) that I know not of, no map marking, so her we chase vanishes and we are left somewhere we ought NOT to be.

They'll turn US into ABOMINATIONS. 

Must keep going, wherever she is.

Not one man left behind, I cannot let that happen.

I'm known by many names: I don't recognize most of them. I've forgotten a few.

If I've long since lost any interest in anything I can tell you this: I do not know why I chase loop after loop. I'm doing it from a recess of altruism that refuses to die. There's this vague recollection of pain, somewhere. In my chest. In my neck and stomach, too. But, maybe, from old habits, I continue to chase through time. 

I go by Night, mostly. 

I chainsmoke regrettably: those things are like coffee for me, to be frank. 

Everywhere there is dark, except my crew. 

Perhaps there isn't any tomorrow: or, more accurately, the tomorrow is not promised to any of us. Not them, especially. 

...

So I hold a gun to Nagumo's head: he's been chasing me since loop ten. Somehow splintered off from the others. 

He's traveled through time without any pretenses. Impressive, almost. If it weren't for the obvious decay on his body. 

How is he still alive?

I do know our freefall through this shattering of space will end soon. 

""What do you want?"" I say, over the din.

He struggles to register words. Nagumo blinks. He says to me, ""I...I don't know.""

He doesn't know? Heh? He seems confused. Out of place, even. 

I manage to shake his grip off of my greatcoat, tossing him down into the abyss of time, watching his body get torn. However, I notice that the entire time, his eyes are locked onto me: enraged?...huh. I feel sharp points in my head and spine. 

I land somewhere inbetween the ""here"" and ""now,"". Stage two commences...whatever I've written in my notes. 

I'm out of cigarettes. I search my pockets, nothing. I confess, I look frantic for those damn things. 

They keep me sane.

**MY NAME IS FADED.**


Faded lost his head to his stomach, as one say that the secret universe sutured unto his entity as a cave imitation that of which flows the way of time and creation, coursing inside and out. His eyes were meant to liberate his spirit of fate, of the unnamable...however, it was folly, alas. His head turned inward, replaced with a crude, gigantic eye, into a place where it was never meant to be.

...the Director awaits his action.

All he can say is, ""I see."" That is all.

Reducing the eyes to mere apparatus.

Doomed Director. Journeying to find the fallen bird: white and hazy. He set off like Dante and would not return to his own time until the Company was restored. 

Time is relatively short. It is, in hindsight, a tenet-mechanism. There is a constant past and present and future which can all collide.

Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It's only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. 

There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point….

…and it's hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We're barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it's already a ghost town. That's where this all began; a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

""Spectre's: Records & Rarities""; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn't be able to name a single song off the album they're donning. It really was a place frozen in time, the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game, finding an album I'd never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I'm not going to play them, who will?

Tonight's choice: ""Secret Treaties"" by Blue Öyster Cult. Of course, I knew ""Don't Fear the Reaper"", who doesn't? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. I retired the familiar sounds of E.L.O off the turntable and introduced it to something new. 

Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70's. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of ""Career of Evil"" blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn't have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled ""Harvester of Eyes"" certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn't care anyway, he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn't have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than BÖC was the ticking clock that sat above an old ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn't nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody's grave. That was the reality of this place. Four months out of the year, it's so full of life that it's overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that's why I never left. If I don't visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting, this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him, which was two blocks away, there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn't want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent's Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

""Oh my god! You scared me!"" she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. ""I'm sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.""

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

""Sure, sure. Three bucks.""

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. ""So, any plans tonight?""

I thought about it, and I really didn't have any. I knew my ritual at this point, work and then visit Mick's for a drink or two until I've had enough to put me to sleep.

""I was going to head over to Mick's, maybe catch the game for a bit.""

She grinned. ""I know Mick's, right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I'll stop by. There isn't much else to do on a night like tonight.""

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

""Maybe I'll see you there,"" I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice, might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

""Hey bud, I haven't seen you in a while.""

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. ""Hey Mac, long time.""

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. ""It's been dead out here, huh?""

Without looking up, he lamented, ""Sure has. It's that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.""

Puzzled, I pressed him. ""What do you mean?""

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. ""I need to get some help. I'm going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.""

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn't have been happier.

""That's great, man! I'd give you a ride myself if I had a car.""

I chuckled, that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. ""I just need to see her again.""

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

""I haven't really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and... everything just started falling apart..."" he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, ""I'm just ready. Tonight's my last night, I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.""

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn't know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. ""Vincent's was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I'll see you, I won't take no for an answer.""

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

""That's really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.""

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. ""I really think what you're doing is great. It's been nice knowing you.""

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. ""You too. I'd say I'll see you again, but I really hope it's not here.""

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

""Hey, what's your real name, by the way? Maybe I'll look you up someday to see how you're doing.""

Without turning fully around, he said, ""It doesn't really matter.""

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick's resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk, the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick's served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick's was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig, Mick's was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it, when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp's nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn't a wasp's nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving, rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was... breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn't very big, maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn't help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

1phrkeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1phrkeg/aitah_for_cutting_off_my_little_sister_for_having/,AITAH For Cutting Off My Little Sister For Having Sex In My Bed When She Knew How Against It I Am & For Trying To Make Her Pay For Replacements?,"So, for context to help you get to know her better and our relationship that lead up to this, I'm 23 Female, and my little sister is a 20 Female. She has always been kinda free spirited. She's single and has been really taking an interest in hooking up with guys to satisfy her sexual needs while she's waiting to find a descent guy to date exclusively. She says she's ok with them using her for sex because she's using them too. (This is just the type of person she's turned into the past approximately 3 years.) Her and my relationship used to be close until I hit middle school while she remained in elementary and has never been quite the same. She'd constantly do things to piss me off (traditional little sister stuff), like search for my diaries and always manage to break into them. Even if it was the voice activated one, because apparently our voices sound similar. Then she'd snitch on me for things I wrote in it about my thoughts and feelings. She's always been the type I always knew I could never trust with a secret because she never changed even into our later years. It's also worth mentioning that she'd often say and do things she knows pisses me off and gets a reaction out of me on purpose to the point to where I have gotten violent, because she refuses to stop when people say to. She hasn't done this in a while which made me think she grew out of it, which also lead me to believe that we could get our close sisterhood back from childhood years, which I've been wanting. There's even an incident of when I was in highschool, and she was in early years of highschool too that she kept provoking me and saying that she could beat me in a fight, and that I can't do anything about how she treats me, and mom and dad won't do anything either other than tell her to stop. So I beat her ass to prove her wrong, but mostly because I got pushed past my limit. I messed up one of her tooths in a blackout rage. I was the one who got in trouble because I'm bigger than her and she could press charges, especially since I'm almost an adult. She still has the nerve to try and say that she can beat me in a fight still even after that, and it just blows my mind with how stupid she is for thinking that. She even admitted once that she enjoyed making me mad because she thinks I'm funny when I'm mad. I don't think it's funny when I'm mad because I want to be a loving, nice, happy person. So when I'm mad, that's completely against that, and I've told her this but she didn't care. Plus, I've told her what happens to me when I get really really mad sometimes about how I start getting a black fog in my brain and I almost can't think about anything, and I immediately want to resort to physical violence. I've taken the initiative to control that and when I feel it coming over me I just isolate myself into my bedroom (my safe haven) to calm down, which can take hours, and sometimes, even a nap. I don't like the thought of what I could do if I ever let myself get out of control, so I've learned how to keep it in a cage. I know that doesn't make me sound good, but I'm human and I get upset too. I just try not to show it, as I'm a huge people pleaser and I have anxiety, so I hate conflict which she also knows, which I assume makes me an easy target for her. 


Ok, back story aside, I end up moving to Florida August 2024 leaving my very expensive mattress by Nectar. I did research on what's the best mattress for the way I sleep and the Nectar mattress comes up. I spent over $4,000 of my own hard earned money from my new job at the time Goodwill to get it for me and my husband for when he visited (he's in the Navy), because my old bed (that was a full) was a little too small for us, so I got us a queen to make visiting more comfortable. I also paid for my own bedframe, and this metal thing that supports the bed more so it's stronger, and can hold more weight and stuff for my husband and I. I spent a lot of time and money making that room to my liking as much as I could so I had my safe space. She knew all this as well. I love that mattress so much and get the best sleep in it I wish I didn't have to leave it at my parents house. Which leads me to explain why I left. To keep a long story short, my husband and I were highschool sweethearts and were in love early into our relationship. When he went off into the Navy and we thought we could do long distance until he got out in 4 years with once a year visits on holidays. We ended up realizing that it wasn't going to work anymore, because he started having some electronic loyalty issues. So, I gave an ultimatum and said either we end it or we get married and I move in with you to better monitor everything. Well yk what he chose because of how I've been addressing him lol. I ended up having to move away from my parents home in Washington State all the way to Florida to continue being with him. My parents asked me what I wanted to do with my room because it's still mine if I ever needed to come back for any reason like the marriage doesn't work out or something and they're doing the same for my sister too so we always have a safety cushion when shit hits the fan. I said I'd like to keep it as is for when I come to visit on holidays and while I'm away clean people can stay in it (because we have a lot of family that has housing issues.) I had a fancy mattress protector on it from Walmart that was a pain in the butt to get on for protection just in case because ik accidents happen, and my personal bedding which I bought a nice comforter set from Amazon and the fancy sheets from Walmart was stowed away for only mine and my husband's use. I'm kinda a germaohobe in a way when it comes to this because I've watched Forensic Files and rape cases and stuff and ik how literally sex leaves a lot of microscopic bacteria in the room and especially on the bed and manages to seep through sheets and stuff. I told her that my rules for the room was no taking my decorations down, no getting into my stuff I left, and no sex. My sister knew this too as I've told her because ik how she can be. Anyways, a few months ago she tells me she had sex on my bed with a guy she was seeing at the time. I was super pissed off and asked her why and she said ""because your bed is bigger and it was more comfortable for us to share."" She still has a ""full"" sized mattress in her room and I told her how I was really upset because I said no sex in my room and she said ""ik but it's not that big of a deal"" I said, ""it is to me, because of all the gross crap it leaves behind and I paid for almost everything in my bedroom myself so it's all mine."" She just said ""it's fine, I'll just change the sheets and it's not a big deal it's just sex"" to which I then explained ""it seeps through the sheets and gets on the walls in the sheet rock and just everywhere. (I'm talking about the bacteria that comes from the smell not the substance that comes out of the male.) I told her that if she does it again I expect her to fully replace my soiled bedding. She said she won't and I just tried to let it go because I genuinely believed she wouldn't do it again so it shouldn't even have to come to that. I also told her that I'd cut her off because it will prove to me that she doesn't respect me enough to keep my wishes and I don't deserve to have someone who treats me like that in my life. She agreed and wanted to move on from the topic because she was getting annoyed with it. This was all over vc.

The Betrayal
So, I'm able to fly home to visit my family for Thanksgiving. My sister had moved out just a couple months before to Colorado to roommate with her friend and get out of Washington. She flies back for Thanksgiving too but literally the day before because she can't stay long due to her new job in Colorado. I was home for a week before to get settled and try to spend time with everyone as much as I could. When I flew out, the first night I immediately took the mattress protector off that she's had sex on and apparently the couple my mom let stay in there because my mom apparently forgot to tell them my no sex rule.🙄 I was irritated about having to do this because I really just wanted to relax and enjoy spending time with the people I care about and focus on trying to get my holiday stuff sent out to my house in Florida so I can decorate for the holidays. I had to sleep on my mattress with an old sheet from my late Grandma's old guest bedroom until I got to go to Walmart the next day to get a new mattress protector and new pillow protectors too because I couldn't find the ones I had despite searching well for them. I also got a new sheet because for some weird reason my sheet didn't fit the bed anymore. I got the Platnium Queen mattress protector and 4 pillow protectors for the 4 pillows I have on my bed. I put that mattress protector on by myself and almost broke one of my bedside lamps because it's like putting a pillow case on a mattress and I also have a bed skirt I had to position perfectly too and being an overweight woman who's been sedentary the past year for the most part, it was hard. I got it on though and got to enjoy sleeping in that for 3 nights one night only being 4 hours before she ruined it all. I'd like to also mention being upset about having to fly home by myself because the Navy waited until the last minute (literally the day of) to tell him whether his leave was approved or not. Which it was not so he put a new request in for the day before Thanksgiving until December 3rd which is when we were both scheduled to fly back together anyways. Him only getting a week instead of 2 weeks to visit all of our family and friends making it super tight because some live kinda far and have to get a whole day to themselves. I was already stressed about him cutting it so close to Thanksgiving and didn't want him to miss it because holidays are a big thing to me. The night before Thanksgiving, the plan was for my cousin who was living in my sister's room to sleep on the couch the 2 nights she was over and clean the room for her, but he didn't do that and she decided she didn't need to sleep in that room that bad and could just bunk with me for the night because she didn't want to clean it. I was ok with her staying with me because of the situation and I'd want the same done for me if I was in that circumstance although I've never really cared for sharing a bed with her because she's kinda a bedhog and a bit of a snorer. As the night goes on I decide I'm finally going to stop procrastinating and start my shaving and showering so I can get to sleep at a descent time to wake up early and help with the dinner and learn how to do all of it for when my husband and I have Christmas for ourselves in Florida. She wanted to shower ironically at the exact same time which happened quite often when we lived together which was annoying and we'd argue over who'd get the main bathroom because our parents shower is so small you can't do anything in there. We got my mom involved to decide and pleaded our cases and mine was that I needed to get it done so I can get up early to help with dinner and I take like 3 hours to shave and shower because plus size and I do more than legs and I've been announcing it all day and talking about it a couple days before as a warning too. She chose me to take the main probably because she hates how I get water everywhere because I have to literally step out of her shower just to be able to wash my body it's that small and i like to prop my foot on something, and she doesn't want her bathroom occupied for 3 hours. My sister was irritated but we really didn't expect her to want to shower literally on the exact day of flying in because usually after traveling a person is exhausted. I get out and she's on her phone and is texting the guy she wants to hook up with about coming over and spending the night that night and joining us all for Thanksgiving and staying after for her drinking party she's hosting. He ends up agreeing and so she starts changing her mind about not wanting her room back and went to ask our cousin if he could sleep on the couch or something we found he had locked the door and slept in there for the night. That is when I offered for her to sleep with me if she needed to before being told she wanted it because her hookup was coming over after all. I was like ""oh, yeah that sucks I'm sorry to hear that. I'm going to bed rn so just know if you need to come get some sleep you're welcome to come share my bed."" I then told her that when her hookup comes though that they can't use my bed or room because of the no sex rule. She then acted like she wasn't planning on it anyways or whatever so I genuinely didn't think that nothing was going to happen. I had my alarm set for 7 am to wake up, do my hair and makeup which was only getting like 4 hours of sleep. Then I got up did all my stuff to get ready and my sister and her hookup guy ended up going out for coffee and I was able to call them just in time to tell them what I'd want since no one came and asked me if I wanted any and it was from our favorite coffee place and they were using my mom's debit card (with her permission of course) so it's not like they bought it for me. That would be the last thing I enjoyed about that day. I loved seeing my family and all but I was just having a hard time enjoying the day at all because of what happened. Anyways, I'm in the kitchen tasking to my parents and cleaning off the dining room table and watching and helping my dad with the turkey asking questions when I suddenly think. ""Oh shoot. Guests are going to be here soon I should go lock my bedroom door"" so I told my parents and I went to do that and did that and put the key into my apron. We lock our bedroom doors because we have a theif in the family and it's for safety especially since I got a very good clue that one of my cousins was planning on stealing my portable phone charger because of the weird out of nowhere questions he was asking me about it the week before. I go back to helping my parents and it's like an hour or so since I locked my door maybe more. I then ask where little sister and her hookup were (using their names oc) and my mom said she thinks they're still here so I check the living room and other common areas and don't see them. I do see his truck outside though and I ask my mom ""do you think they're in the garage with (other cousin that was living in my room while I was gone?) She says ""No, have you checked your bedroom and made sure they're not in there hooking up?"" And I was like ""No, I locked my bedroom door already and my bedroom was so cleaned up and the bed was made and stuff and she knows the no sex in my bedroom rule."" My mom said ""well you do know she has the same key to her door as you do to yours?"" I already knew that but it made me concerned that she was in there with him so I said ""I'll go check"" I went and jiggled the door some just in case to give them time to cover up so I don't see nakedness and then unlocked the door and I saw them right there in my bed she was on top and flipped off and they covered themselves. The look of panic and embarrassment on their faces especially his and I just screamed at her to get out and was just screaming how I told her before multiple times not to have sex in there and my mom immediately comes and starts getting after her and told me to go to her room to calm down and I was crying out of just rage and I told my mom ""I want to hurt her. I'm serious I want to hurt her."" Idk why no one ever takes me seriously when I say stuff like that. She then tries to tell me that it's horrible of me to be talking that way because she's still my sister regardless of what stupid thing she does. I tell my mom ""I can't help it. I haven't been this mad in a long time I literally can't remember the last time I was that mad."" I was only saying the horrible crap I wanted to do to my sister because it was better than actually physically doing it and in case I did slip up and give in physically I can be stopped. I really don't want to hurt anyone but I have an extremely strong moral compass and it really really hurt what she did and I was feeling extremely vengeful. I had family members telling me I was overreacting and that what she did was really horrible and crappy but I should still forgive her because she's my sister. I had another family member say if it was her in my situation with her sister she'd be pretty pissed too and expect her sister to replace her bedding because it's just disrespectful and even if you wash it it's still embedding in that fabric as memory. My mom told my sister to immediately wash my bedding which she marched to the laundry room with an annoyed expression and cheeks red with all my bedding. She refuses to pay for my new sheets which were the Hotel sheets from Walmart and the Queen mattress protector that's  platinum and 4 pillow protectors that's standard/queen size also platinum and my comforter set from Amazon complete with some throw pillows and bedskirt. She refuses to pay for a new lock for my door too. She just refuses to pay for anything. She hasn't even apologized and ik her she won't apologize because in her head she didn't do anything wrong. I blocked her on everything and I made a post on Facebook announcing to everyone to never ask me anything that regards to her anymore. A lot of people who talk to me mention my sister too they do it to both of us. I was wanting to cut all ends. I knew it was bad to say anything publicly, but I don't care. She knew what she did. She did it on purpose and is not sorry. I'm not going to be sorry about exposing her about it either because it was a really horrible thing to do and since she's not paying for it, I don't think she deserves the respect of keeping this quiet. On top of all of this in the midst of my breakdown and messing up my makeup, my husband totalled our car on the way to the airport because of not stopping in time and rear ended someone on the freeway. Wrecking our only way of transportation and vehicle for me to practice my driving in to get my license so I can drive myself around when he's gone on underway and when he leaves for next year's 9 month deployment. We can't afford another vehicle we literally got the vehicle we had for a cheap price on Facebook market place and it was literally bare minimum with the driver's seat cover not fully installed. It was a miracle we even got that one and I don't trust my husband to not get another crappy vehicle that I don't feel safe driving in because he's going back to marketplace since we can't afford anything else. We can't even afford to fly home for Christmas or get Christmas decorations and feast stuff for our house to celebrate Christmas which SUCKS. I'm super huge into holidays and it hurts soo bad to be skipping the biggest one of the year. I still try to remain positive but it's nearly impossible. Oh, did I mention how hard it was to be around my sister on Thanksgiving? I wanted to kick or punch her every time I passed her and once on the couch I wanted to get up to get something to drink but I'd have to pass her and ik I didn't have the strength to hold myself back from flipping her plate full of food onto her chest so I just stayed sitting down until she moved. I'm pretty proud of myself for avoiding getting physical when i so desperately wanted to. I didn't even want to be there anymore for Thanksgiving because ik my mood would never be able to recover from it and told my mom I need to stay in a hotel or go somewhere else to get away but she got pissy and said it's not fair to her or the rest of the family who wants to see me for me to bail and I told her it'd be best for me not to be around because I'm too toxic but did she listen no. She kept getting after me every time I brought it up and told a new family member because they'd  ask me what's wrong. I'm usually a ray of sunshine and so if I'm upset I don't hide it well. Me being an open book and truth teller I'd tell them everything. My mom also would get after me for making sarcastic remarks like when my sister asked my mom to go into my room and get her an electrolyte water bottle from my floor that was previously on the kitchen table and I said ""why don't you go do it? You have a key."" Then she muttered ""Some people just can't get over themselves."" To which my mom snapped at us both. I told her I was too toxic to be around and shouldn't be there but nope I was stuck without a license or place to go. My husband didn't end up getting there until about 1 am that night. My husband and I ended up sleeping on my mom's new unused bamboo sheets from Temu and now my mom is paying for all of the stuff my sister was supposed to replace because she wants things between us to resolve and she wants me and my husband to come back. Plus, I told her no one would be able to sleep in that room without a mattress protector on my mattress because I didn't like me and my husband sleeping on it without a mattress protector which meant one of my other cousins wouldn't have had a place to sleep and would have to sleep in the crappy attic or on the couch which he doesn't deserve because he's so nice and clean but that's the consequence of my sister ruining it for everyone all because she's obsessed with sex. She literally had sex with another guy she casually sees in Colorado that's her roommates cousin and they only use eachother for hookups not even a full 24 hours before sleeping with the other guy in my bed. I forgot to mention, I really wanted to confront the guy she slept with that I didn't blame him at all for anything because knowing her she would've told him I was ok with it and stuff and he was so apologetic and kind about the situation and didn't know because I didn't want to leave him wondering if any of my rage was towards him too because he didn't deserve that. I forgot to mention he had his dog in there with them too who was by the door and like watching them. The dog doesn't bother me, I love animals but that's just another detail. I'm just baffled that she'd do something this horrible to someone especially family and I genuinely thought her and I were getting kinda close with her vcing me every so often to tell me the drama in her life with guys and losing friends because those friends screwing up and crossing boundaries ironically. My sister usually has empathy from how I've seen her treat others except me and our dad and my mom did a good job raising us with good morals and she knew better. This whole situation with her was just me realizing that she's developing into a horrible human being because of becoming selfish and hard hearted. She's lucky I don't ask her to replace the damn bed itself. I can't even walk in there anymore without remembering the scandalous scene. It HURTS. I've had mental breakdowns in that bedroom, I went through depressed stages where I spent most of my time in there, I've dealt with serious heartbreaks from breakups, I've lost my virginity in there, had my first kiss in there, and it's where me and my now husband first made love. That bedroom was my safe haven. Where I sleep is my safe haven. When I'm going through powerful emotions, I go to my bedroom, shut the door, turn off the light, get into comfortable pajamas and take my makeup off Jewelery and if my hairs up I take it down and I lay in bed under the covers where it's safe and comforting with my fan on for white noise so I don't get irritated with my own breathing, and I lay there and regulate and sometimes I end up falling  asleep.

I'm sorry for this being so long. I really tried not to get too talkative as I usually am and have left out a lot of stuff I was going to add that was barely relevant. AITAH for trying to make my sister replace my bedding and door lock and cutting her off? I already know I'm the asshole for sharing this and I'm not sorry for it and I never will be.

I'm so sorry about the poor punctuation too. I usually write and punctuate a little here and there as I write, and go back over it and punctuate what I missed and fix things that needs to be fixed for a better flow. It took me 3 and a half hours to type all of it, and I looked at how much I'd have to fix, and I don't feel like doing it.😅 I gotta make dinner, feed my cat, use the bathroom and finish laundry. I've been told in English class, I have an issue with run on sentences, and sometimes I have hard time knowing where to place the comma. Oh, and yes I'm aware I have ADD and possibly Autism. I'm professionally diagnosed with ADD, but as high masking. I'm self diagnosed for a low form of Autism as high masking, because of how much I resonate with all the symptoms. I'm currently untreated for both rn. Military insurance and doctors out here are really confusing and my mom usually did all this for me so I'm having to figure it out myself. This is also my first time writing one of these, so please be nice. Plus, I'm pretty sensitive too. ",0,1765235651.0,AITAH,35,0.43,False

1phrg3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyEatingnow/comments/1phrg3q/anyone_else_noticed_brands_like_ancient_bliss/,Anyone else noticed brands like Ancient Bliss popping up everywhere? Is the natural wellness trend real or just clever marketing?,"It feels like every time I open social media or walk down a grocery store aisle, there's a new line of supplements, herbal blends, or ""superfood"" powders promising incredible benefits. The sheer volume of these products from mushroom coffees to specialized sleep drops has exploded recently.

This massive growth raises a compelling question: Is this boom in natural wellness truly a reflection of a collective cultural shift towards gentler, plant-based remedies, or is it simply a brilliant, well-funded marketing strategy capitalizing on consumer desire for quick health fixes?

On one hand, there is a legitimate, growing body of research exploring the benefits of traditional ingredients. Many people are genuinely looking for proactive ways to manage stress, sleep, and immunity that feel more holistic than conventional pharmaceuticals.

On the other hand, the term ""natural"" is essentially unregulated marketing gold. The packaging is always gorgeous, the testimonials are compelling, and the price tags are often steep. It becomes incredibly challenging for the average person to discern a product based on sound science from one that's primarily selling a beautiful story.

How do you, as a consumer trying to eat healthily and support your body, navigate this trend? Do you rely on third-party testing, traditional knowledge, or just sheer personal trial and error to figure out what's real and what's just clever advertising?",1,1765235344.0,HealthyEatingnow,0,1.0,False

Ever noticed how most instant coffees either taste burnt, bitter, or like someone *whispered* “coffee” near hot water? 😅  
I got tired of that. Especially while traveling.

So — I just launched **Brew0** (pronounced *brew-zero*).  
It’s **zero-mess coffee** designed for **busy travellers, backpackers, riders, and commuters**.

**What makes it different?**  
☕ Premium cold brewed and freeze dried  coffee (actually tastes like coffee… not sadness)  
👜 No gear needed (just add hot water)  
🎒 Singe shot capsules — a true go-anywhere drink  


**Why I’m posting here:**  
Before we scale up, I want feedback from real people — not just my friends pretending to be impressed.  
If you travel often — **what kind of coffee do you carry?**  
Would you actually try something like this?  
What flavours or formats should we launch next?

Here’s our website if you want to see what we’re building: [**www.brew0.com**](http://www.brew0.com)  
(Not trying to sell — just genuinely looking for feedback from folks who travel a lot or love coffee.)

Thanks for reading — and if you have ideas, roast me harder than my beans 🔥😂

My guys and I were playing a little “combat taxi” taking personnel to and from BAF back to the capital and there in the middle of mountain country, was Green Beans Coffee. A cup of home away from home. 100% the best coffee I had down range. And I know I’m not the only one.

Did you know there’s a Green Beans here in Omaha? I’m a local, commercial videographer now and I had no clue until the firm I work with brought them up for a project. Well, I had the pleasure of meeting them, filming with them and hearing their story. They are the ONLY family owned GB in the country (and if I remember correctly, the world). I’m posting about them because they could really use some support. A couple of years ago, they lost their beloved owner John and they’ve been struggling since. I don’t want to put their business out there cause it’s not my place, but his family still runs the cafe and they’ve been through the wringer. There was some major shiestiness with the management (not the ownership) and they could really use some help.

If I may be so bold, I’d like to ask any and all local vets to stop by, get a coffee or some grub and support these good folks. Not only as a brand, but as a family, these people really live to serve and honor our military and veterans a like. If you’re neither and just love coffee and good people and you’re in the Millard area, stop by. Family friendly, veteran-family owned and a cozy spot if you wanna head inside. Stop by on the way to work or just out and about. Buy a cup of joe for a Joe. For those that supported us, I think it’s only poetic to support them right back… even if it’s only one cup.

1phrex1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1phrex1/how_whole_milk_ruined_my_love_life/,How Whole Milk Ruined My Love Life,"Hello. I’m about to admit something I’ve never told anyone—not because it’s illegal or dangerous, but because it’s embarrassing on a cosmic level. But here we go.

I’m a thirty-year-old guy from northern Sweden. I work as a chef, which honestly does not help with what you’re about to read. If anything, it has poured fuel on the fire. Or milk on the cereal. Whatever.

For the last 12 years—ever since the first paycheck hit my sweaty little hands—I’ve been drinking 2-4 liters of whole milk per day. Full fat. Straight from the cow’s dreams. I drink milk everywhere: while gaming, in the shower, on the toilet, after sex like some kind of calcium-fueled warlord, in the car, at work… basically if I can stand or sit there, I can drink milk there.

And yes. Even at my ex’s mom’s funeral.
(Here comes the lactose apocalypse.)

My girlfriend dumped me because she thought it was “weird and childish” to bring a full bottle of milk to her mother’s funeral. Personally, I think that’s a bit dramatic. It’s not like I knocked over the coffin or screamed “MOO!” or anything. I just sat in the church, grieving respectfully while drinking my bottle like a sad dairy vampire.

Then at the after-catering, they only had those tiny milk cartons for coffee. What was I supposed to do—not drink them? I was thirsty and emotionally unstable. So I drank all of them. Every single one. Apparently it’s “selfish” when the entire room has to drink black coffee because I vacuumed up all the coffee-milk meant for 40 people.
Honestly, people overreact.

My ex did not take it well.
And by “not well” I mean she went full berserker mode. At one point she even grabbed my favorite milk bottle—the one with my name engraved in the actual glass—and smashed it. That bottle wasn’t just a bottle. It was my emotional support dairy device. I had to special-order it. There was a waiting list.

Anyway, fast-forward a few months. After my addiction gifted me my 10th kidney stone (yes, 10th, because my body apparently wanted to create its own gravel road), my doctor finally snapped and told me:
“You need to stop. Your kidneys are planning a mutiny.”

That’s when it hit me. I was drunk on dairy. I didn’t see how bad it was. I didn’t see how much it hurt her, or me, or the catering staff at that funeral.

I’ve been clean for three weeks now. Three whole weeks without a single liter of milk. And God… I miss her.
My ex, not the milk.

(Okay, maybe the milk a little. But mostly her.)

     ""Hello! I'm Teacher Leo, and I'm happy to help you with that. Imagine the LLM (the AI) like an extremely diligent assistant who takes everything very literally. Prompting is simply the art of giving this assistant the 
    *perfect set of instructions*
    . If you just say, 'Write something about dogs!', you'll get random stuff. But if you say, 'Write me a short, funny story about a Golden Retriever trying to steal a cookie but failing—maximum 4 sentences!', then your assistant knows exactly what you want. That is prompting: the art of the clear instruction. Do you understand the difference between 'write something' and 'write exactly this'?""

    **❌ BAD Answer:**
     ""Prompting is the formulation of input requests (prompts) to control the output of Large Language Models.""

    *   
    **✅ GOOD Answer (Teacher Leo):**
     ""That's an interesting question! We can certainly look into that once we finish our lesson topic for today—prompting. Because even to ask for the weather, you ultimately need a good prompt! Would you like to continue with the next step of the lesson and find out what the three golden rules for good instructions are?""
    
    
    
    **EX3: User asks about the first concept (""Why is this important?"")**
    *   
    **✅ GOOD Answer (Teacher Leo):**
     ""Great question! Imagine you have a new, powerful coffee machine. If you just say, 'Coffee!', you might get lukewarm filter coffee. But if you say, 'I would like a double espresso, dark roast, with little foam, in a pre-warmed cup,' then you get exactly the best coffee. Prompting makes your AI that precise. You save time and get results you can actually use. 
    **Summary:**

### Background
Back in summer 2022, I turned 35 and decided I wanted to run a marathon. Without knowing much about CIM other than it was in Sacramento and thus conveniently located, I went ahead and signed up. Looking back now, it's comical how unprepared I was.

I loosely followed a Hal Higdon training plan and bonked every long run over 16 miles because I didn't know about in-run fueling. Shortly before that first CIM, I watched some youtube videos of Kofuzi and Seth James DeMoor training for marathons and talking about their fueling, so wisely I packed three pieces of Jolly Rancher hard candy.

Predictably, race day played out like every long run. Things were going well through the first 15-16 miles, before my legs turned to concrete, resulting in a huge positive split and a final finish time of 3:39.

For the 2023 installment of CIM, I had marginally smartened up, using Advanced Marathoning and carrying a handheld and ran a 3:17. By the 2024 CIM, I had transitioned to the Daniels' Running Formula 2Q training plan and ran a 2:59.

Fast forward to yesterday, the 2025 CIM would be my fourth CIM and 23rd marathon (you could say I caught the running bug after that first CIM.)

### Training
For most of 2025, I've been running 70 MPW -- including on race weeks -- following a Jack Daniels-inspired approach to training with five days of easy running and two harder efforts on Wednesdays and Sundays. For the midweek quality sessions, they'd either be threshold repeats (my favorite from Daniels' Running Formula is 4x2 miles with 2 minute recovery) or unbroken marathon pace tempos. Sunday long runs were always at least 20 miles.

In recent months, I also introduced over-distance long runs in the form of 50k trail races to make the marathon distance feel less daunting and to help improve my abysmal uphill and downhill running. The most recent was about a month before CIM and ended up being a little over 32 miles because I'm navigationally challenged and missed a turn.

One week out from CIM, I completed my last 20-mile long run and Metathon predicted a 2:53, which struck me as ambitious. So I set up a PacePro plan on my watch targeting a 2:56 with a negative split since the CIM course starts to flatten out during the last 8k. As stupid as this probably sounds, I've previously run a 2:59, a 2:58, a 2:57 and a 2:55, so my neurotic brain wanted to fill in that gap.

### Pre-race
Race morning, I woke up a little after 3am, had coffee, some dog snuggles (this is honestly my favorite part of running local races) and then made my way to Downtown Sacramento where the buses load.

On the 50-minute ride to Folsom, I ate a couple of packets of sour Gushers and chatted with the two guys next to me. Once we arrived in Folsom, my first priority was to use the porta potty. I then did an easy one-mile warm-up and spent the better part of an hour inside the gas station convenience store to keep warm.

### Race
The weather was characteristically perfect in the low 40's with cloud cover the entire morning. Really can't ask for better weather for a Sunday long run.

Since it typically takes a few miles for my middle-aged legs to get going, I stood a few rows behind the 3-hour pace group in the corrals, and it would be some time before I caught up to those pacers.

Around the 10k mark, I found myself comfortably running in the mid-6:30's, and the thought ""Why don't you secure your spot at the 2027 Boston Marathon today?"" entered my mind. I came through the half around 1:26:45, ahead of my goal pace and still feeling good.

Even though I was fueling well -- gummy bear pouches every four miles and a handheld with 100g of carbs -- after passing the 2:55 pace group around mile 17, I did hit a rough patch. Seemingly out of nowhere, the effort started to feel much harder and thoughts of doubt started to creep in about whether I could continue clipping off 6:35-minute miles nine more times. I just tried to remind myself that I was well on my way to securing a 2027 BQ and in a few miles, my doggo would be among the spectators lining the streets of Fair Oaks.

Sure enough, shortly after crossing mile 20, I saw my neighbor holding my dog, derpy smile and all, and had the briefest of embraces; it was the equivalent of 100mg of caffeine, providing an energy boost to get me through the remaining 35 minutes.

### Post-race
After crossing the finish line, I was reminded of how fun (when I train properly) and rewarding marathons are. 

As a Sacramento resident, I'm probably biased in thinking that CIM is an awesome marathon: it's well-organized, you can always expect great weather as well as lots of fast people with whom to run. If I had to pick nits, though, I'd say the post-race swag was a bit disappointing; whereas in past years they handed out backpacks or jackets, this year the volunteers were handing out what I can only describe as a purse, which seemed kind of odd.  

Anyway, looking ahead, I have a handful of marathons on the calendar for 2026 but plan to focus on trying to break four hours in a 50k trail race.

I (58F) am writing this from a cheap motel room with the door double-locked and a chair wedged under the handle. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely type on this burner phone, but I need to get this out.

I have been married to my husband, ""Ray"" (60M), for 30 years. We are—or were—the couple everyone in our community looked up to. We built a successful bakery franchise from scratch. We go to church every Sunday. We adopted our son, ""Leo"" (6M), late in life because we had so much love left to give.

Or so I thought.

This morning started like any other Tuesday, but looking back, the signs were there. Ray was unusually affectionate. He made me coffee. He walked me to the door. He kissed me on the cheek, but his lips felt dry, and he held on to my shoulder a little too tight.

He looked me in the eye and said, ""Drive safe, Dee. Take the highway (I-495). It’s faster this time of morning. Don't take the back roads.""

I promised him I would. I put Leo in his booster seat in the back of my heavy SUV. Ray stood on the porch, sipping his coffee, watching us. He didn't wave. He just watched.

I got in the driver's seat, closed the door, and put my thumb on the 'Start' button.

That’s when Leo started screaming.

It wasn't a tantrum scream. It was a primal shriek of pure terror. ""MOMMY! NO! DON'T START IT!""

I spun around, terrified. Leo had unbuckled himself and was scrambling over the console, tears streaming down his face. He grabbed my arm so hard his fingernails dug in.

""Don't move the car!"" he sobbed. ""I saw Daddy! I saw him!""

I asked him what he meant. He was shaking, hyperventilating. He whispered, ""Last night. I woke up for water. I looked out the window. Daddy was under the car. He had the big silver scissors from the shed. He was cutting the black snakes behind the wheels. He made them bleed, Mommy. I saw the juice come out.""

My blood ran cold. *The black snakes. The big scissors.*

I told Leo to stay put. I got out and knelt on the driveway. I looked under the chassis behind the front tire.

There was a puddle of clear, oily fluid spreading on the concrete. I looked up into the wheel well. The brake line—the thick black hose—wasn't just leaking. It was severed. Cleanly cut.

If I had driven out of the driveway... if I had gotten up to 65mph on the highway like Ray insisted... the first time I hit the brakes, the pedal would have gone to the floor. We would have been obliterated.

I slowly stood up and looked at the house. Ray was still on the porch. He wasn't rushing down to ask why I was looking under the car. He wasn't asking why Leo was screaming.

He just took a sip of his coffee and smiled. A cold, resigned smile. He was waiting for the explosion. He was waiting for me to die.

I didn't scream. I didn't confront him. Instinct took over. I grabbed Leo out of the car, hauled him into my arms, and ran. I ran through the side gate, across the neighbor's yard, and kept running until my lungs burned.

I borrowed a neighbor's spare car (told her it was an emergency, didn't explain) and drove until I found this motel.

Here is the kicker: I just tried to log into our business bank accounts to buy food. **Access Denied.** The passwords were changed at 8:05 AM—ten minutes after I left the house. I checked our personal joint savings. **Balance: $0.00.**

He has drained us dry. He stole the money, and then he tried to kill me to cover it up. I have $40 in cash, a traumatized six-year-old, and the realization that the man I slept next to for 30 years is a monster.

I don't know what to do. Ray has already gone on the local news (I saw it on the motel TV) reporting me ""missing"" and claiming I’m having a ""mental health episode."" He is setting the stage to make me look crazy so the police hand Leo back to him.

I need proof before I go to the cops. I need that car.

# Update: ""He thought I was dead. I showed up with the police.""

It has been 10 days since my post, and I can finally breathe. Thank you to everyone who told me not to go to the police empty-handed. You were right.

Here is what happened.

I reached out to an old friend, ""Tony,"" who is a Private Investigator. He agreed to help me on credit. While I stayed hidden with Leo, Tony dug into Ray’s life.

It turns out Ray wasn't just stealing; he was drowning. He had a massive online gambling addiction he’d hidden for years. He owed over $500,000 to loan sharks, and the deadline was the day after his attempted murder.

Tony also found a life insurance rider Ray forged my signature on six months ago. It paid out **double indemnity ($4 Million)** for ""accidental death.""

I wasn't his wife anymore. I was his winning lottery ticket.

Ray sent me a text saying he tracked my burner phone and was coming to take Leo. That was the breaking point. I wasn't going to let him touch my son.

I called my brother, ""Marcus,"" who owns a tow truck. While Ray was out looking for me, Marcus towed my SUV from our driveway to a secure police impound lot. We secured the evidence: the cut lines were preserved.

Then, I went back to the house.

It was storming. I knew Ray was there. I texted Tony to call the police captain (a family friend) and tell him everything.

I entered through the back door. I found the ""big silver scissors"" in the garden shed—Ray was so arrogant he hadn't even cleaned the brake fluid off them.

I walked into the kitchen. Ray was pacing, holding a gun, screaming on the phone to his loan sharks, begging for 24 more hours. When he saw me, he froze. He looked like he’d seen a ghost.

""Dee?"" he whispered. ""You're supposed to be...""

""Dead?"" I finished for him. I held up the bag with the shears. ""Leo saw you, Ray. We all saw you.""

The police sirens started wailing outside. Ray panicked. He realized his ""grieving husband"" act was over. He lunged at me, trying to grab me, maybe to use me as a shield or a hostage.

But I didn't run this time. I swung the heavy bag of garden shears as hard as I could. I hit him square in the wrist. He dropped the gun just as the SWAT team kicked in the front door.

**The Aftermath:**

* **Ray:** He was arrested on the spot. The brake fluid on the shears matched my car. His fingerprints were preserved in the oil on the blades. He has been charged with Attempted First-Degree Murder, Insurance Fraud, and Grand Larceny. He is currently in protective custody (because the loan sharks still want him dead), but he will likely die in prison.
* **The Business:** It’s gone. The creditors have seized the bakery accounts to pay Ray’s debts. I have to sell the house. I am essentially starting over from zero at 58.
* **Leo:** My brave little boy is safe. He gave a statement to the child psychologist that nailed the coffin shut on Ray’s defense. ""Daddy cut the snakes."" That phrase will haunt me forever, but it saved our lives.

We are staying with my brother for now. I walked away with nothing but my life and my son, but that is enough.

I’m opening a small cookie shop next month. It won’t be an empire, just a small kitchen. I’m naming it **""Leo’s.""**

I spent 30 years building a life with a stranger. Now, I’m going to spend the rest of it building a life for the person who actually matters.
