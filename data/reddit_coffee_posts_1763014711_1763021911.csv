Hey Maximizame crew,

Ever have one of those weeks where you feel like you're just *reacting* to everything? Your calendar is a mess, your energy is low, and ""success"" feels like a buzzword you read in a book once. Been there. Deep in that trench.

But lately, I've been focusing on small, almost ""stupidly simple"" shifts that have made a massive difference. Not about adding more to the plate, but about changing the plate itself.

Here’s what’s been working for me:

**Stop managing time. Start managing ENERGY.**
We all get 24 hours. But not all hours are created equal. I stopped forcing myself to do creative work at 3 PM when I'm in a slump. Instead, I match my highest-energy hours with my most important tasks. Low-energy time is for laundry, deleting emails, and admin stuff. This one shift alone felt like I unlocked a cheat code.

**Build a ""Joy Menu.""**
Seriously, write it down. A list of small, easy things that bring you genuine joy.
*   *Listening to that one perfect album.*
*   *A 10-minute walk without your phone.*
*   *Making a really good cup of coffee.*
When you feel the burnout creeping in, you don't have to think. Just pick something from the menu. It's a system for happiness.

It's easy to focus on the external stuff—the schedules, the goals, the metrics. But sometimes the biggest block is our own head. The constant self-doubt or the feeling of being overwhelmed can derail even the best plans. Honestly, getting a handle on the emotional side of things was a game-changer for me. Having a structured plan to fall back on when things get overwhelming is crucial. I found that **this resource (affiliate link)** was amazing for building that mental and emotional foundation.

**Embrace the ""One-Thing"" Rule for your goals.**
Instead of a to-do list with 20 items that makes you want to crawl back into bed, ask yourself: ""What's the **one thing** I can do today that will make everything else easier or unnecessary?"" Sometimes it's making that dreaded phone call. Sometimes it's mapping out a project. But focusing on that single domino makes the rest of them fall.

It’s all a process, right? No one just wakes up ""optimized."" It's about finding these little levers that make a big difference over time.

So, what’s one small tweak you've made recently that's given you back more time, joy, or a sense of progress? Let's share some ideas.",1,1763021094.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

We'd been together for four years. She had this ex from college who she ""stayed friends with"" because they had ""history"" and ""understood each other."" Fine. Whatever. I'm not the jealous type. But this guy texted her constantly. Called her at weird hours. They grabbed coffee every other week. When I asked her to maybe set some boundaries, she looked at me like I'd asked her to cut off her own arm.

""I'm not cutting off my ex just because you're insecure,"" she said. We were in the kitchen and she was making pasta. She didn't even look up from the pot.

I nodded. ""Fair point.""

Three days later, I accepted the Amsterdam position.

Here's the thing. I work in software engineering. This company had been trying to recruit me for almost two years. Big salary bump, leadership role, relocation package. I'd turned them down three times because my girlfriend hated the idea of leaving her family, her job, her life here. The third time I declined, she cried and told me how much it meant to her that I chose us over my career.

But after that kitchen conversation, something clicked. I called the recruiter back. Turns out they still wanted me. I had six weeks to relocate.

I didn't tell her right away. I started quietly packing, sorting through what to keep and what to donate. Filed the paperwork for breaking my lease early. My landlord was annoyed but I paid the penalty. Found someone to take over, a grad student who was thrilled to get a place on short notice.

Two weeks before my flight, I told her over dinner at our usual spot. She was talking about her ex again, how he was going through a rough time and needed support.

""I'm moving to Amsterdam,"" I said.

She stopped mid-sentence. ""What?""

""Remember that position? I accepted it. I leave in two weeks.""

Her face went white, then red. ""You can't be serious. You turned that down. We talked about this.""

""We did talk about it. And you made your priorities clear.""

She started crying right there in the restaurant. People stared. She grabbed my hand across the table. ""You're doing this to punish me. Because of him.""

""I'm doing this because I deserve to be someone's priority too.""

The next two weeks were chaos. She called constantly. Showed up at my job. Sent long texts about how we could work it out, how she'd set boundaries with her ex, how I was throwing away four years over nothing. Her mom even called me, said I was being cruel and immature.

I blocked her mom. Kept packing.

She had a key to my apartment but I'd already moved most of my stuff to a storage unit to ship overseas. By the time I flew out, the place was empty except for furniture that came with it. The new tenant was moving in the same week I left.

I landed in Amsterdam on a Tuesday. Got settled into corporate housing. Started my new job that Monday. It was intense, exciting, everything I'd wanted professionally.

Three weeks later, my phone exploded. Fifteen missed calls from her. Dozens of texts. She'd flown out. She was at ""my apartment."" She needed to talk. This was crazy. We needed to fix this.

Then the texts got confused. Angry. Someone else answered the door. Some guy. Was I seeing someone already? Was this whole thing about another woman?

I called her back. ""That's the new tenant. I told you I was leaving.""

""I thought you'd come back,"" she said. She was crying. ""I thought you just needed space. I broke things off with him. Completely. I blocked him. I told my family I was wrong. I booked this flight to prove I'm serious.""

""You flew to Amsterdam to work things out with someone who doesn't live there anymore.""

Silence on the other end.

""I'm sorry,"" I said. And I was. Not sorry enough to go back, but sorry that it took something this dramatic for her to realize I wasn't bluffing. ""I hope you have a good trip back.""

She called me cruel. Vindictive. Said I'd planned this whole thing to humiliate her. Her friends have been messaging me, saying I'm petty and should have communicated better. My own family is split, some think I did what I needed to do, others think I should have given her a chance to change.

But here's what gets me. She had months to choose differently. Every time I brought up feeling like a backup option, she dismissed it. The job offer wasn't some surprise, I'd been talking about it for years. And now because I actually followed through, I'm the villain?

So I need outside perspective here. Should I have stayed and worked it out when she finally offered to set boundaries, or was I right to leave when someone shows you they won't prioritize you until you're already gone?",0,1763020902.0,FoundandExpose,1,0.5,False

I came to Delhi 2 years back for studies and from that point of time , I have always been googling is this place safe to go? Asked seniors which areas were safe to explore,everyone gave different answers. Some said South Delhi was fine, others said don't go anywhere alone after dark. Nobody had actual data, just ""vibes."" Saw girls posting their solo adventures looking confident, meanwhile I was googling ""is this safe for girls"" before leaving my room. My mom and dad would call me 1000 times to know if I was safe. 

I remember during my first year I skipped plans because most of my friends were day scholars and I don't want to come back my pg alone . I was so literally so frustrated and have to come back to my pg before 7 most of the times. Every time I want to explore somewhere new in Delhi or plan a trip, it's the same anxiety: checking five different sources, asking random people, still not knowing for sure. I don't have a big friend group just me and my 2 friends and that's why it still a problem for us!

**Here's what I realized:** nobody tracks the information that actually matters for solo travelers especially women. Not which cafe has good coffee, but whether you'll get harassed walking there alone at 7 PM.

So I built something to fix this. Not adding many people ,Why? Because the moment too many people join, it becomes another useless platform full of fake reviews and outdated info.

If you don't fit this, or you're just curious, **don't waste a spot**. And if you really care about safety you can join , upto you!

I started out with Flutterflow about 4 months ago after researching low-code no-code platforms with integrated AI. Flutterflow ticked all the boxes for me, especially because of it's local run feature, cross platform abilities and easy deployment to the google and apps stores.

A few months later and I have a pretty strong MVP for my coffee price finding app (it's called BeanThere), that I've released! Super happy with that, and using the UI abilities within FF, the app actually looks decent too. That certainly wouldn't have been possible for me without Flutterflow.

The part I'm struggling with now is actually getting users. Probably something all app developers face at some point. Can anyone here give me some tips on how I can get my app out there with minimal budget but maximum exposure? In return I'd be more than happy to help other Flutterflow first time users with their journey, as I have learnt a lot.

What I'm trying so far is to build a social following on Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. I've done daily videos on TikTok, but it's hard to get traction amongst the noise. Any other advice?

My app is completely free, and since I'm trying to help people save money and find the best coffee places, it would be a shame if I can't get users. I welcome all feedback, and if I can get a user base of say 100 people, that would be amazing so the app can be shaped further as I don't want to stop!

Really hoping the reddit community comes through 🙂

Thanks,

I just wanted to clarify that I had already posted the link to my fundraiser, but it was deleted… 😞 The same goes for my replies to your comments; I'm not really sure why. Many of you have asked how you can help me concretely, and that gives me hope in this difficult situation.
A wonderful person was kind enough to create an online fundraiser for me. This will allow all the generous souls who wish to support me to do so transparently. So, I'm making this new post to clarify and share it directly here.

I know that my situation may seem insignificant to some. In a world filled with more visible crises and collective tragedies, who am I to ask for attention?

I know that giving money to a stranger online is hard. I myself never thought I would do that one day.  I understand perfectly. It's your absolute right not to do it; I'm not judging, I'm not blaming anyone. Life is already so hard for so many of us; bills pile up, priorities shift, and every euro counts.

I respect those who can't. I respect those who have doubts. I respect those who have already given so much to other causes.

I'm not asking for the moon, nor for exorbitant sums that would change your life. Just a little help, a modest gesture that, multiplied, could transform mine. Imagine: a coffee you buy for a friend, a book you buy for yourself, it's this kind of small contribution that could help me move forward... These small amounts, when they add up, can change a life. Mine.
If you can, please give me this little boost.

 I'm available to answer any questions you may have, whether in the comments or via private message.
If you can't, please share this post.

I remember a café called Black Art Coffee run by Geetartha Da (guitar_guy on Instagram), which unfortunately shut down. I feel like the lack of a community might have been one of the reasons, and it’s sad because it closed just before I got into speciality coffee.

It's basically Duolingo for your money. You get levels from ""Newbie"" to ""Wall Street Shark,"" streak protections so you don't lose your progress, and a dashboard that shows your financial health at a glance. The MVP is about 70% done - Streamlit web app, mobile optimized.

What we've got so far: one-tap expense tracking because let's be real, if it takes more than 10 seconds to log a coffee, people won't do it. A level system that actually makes you feel good about saving. And streak mechanics borrowed from every addictive mobile game ever.

Target is 18-35 year old Hispanics who've downloaded Mint or similar apps but quit because let's face it, staring at spreadsheets is depressing.

So roast me. Tell me why this is the dumbest idea you've heard this week. Is the gamification too cringey? Would anyone actually care about ""leveling up"" their finances? Am I solving a problem that doesn't exist?

It wasnt your typical first date. During our conversation she mentioned she had to travel a little ways for a family event she was nervous to go to. She threw it out there and asked if I wanted to join. Im always up for an adventure. So I said yes. It was a whole day thing including the drive there and back. Conversation was awesome. Her family was chill. We got back to our home town. She offered to buy me dinner which was a wild gesture and kind. So we ate at a resturant. Could tell she wanted to kiss afterward in her car but I bitched out. Two days later we went on our second date. Coffee. Spent two hours chatting and laughing had a great time. At the end of it I gave her a gift I had grabbed at work. A cool rock, we are both into geology and I work at a mine with ample specimen laying about. She loved it! I opened her car door for her and she asked to kiss me so of course I obliged. I liked it and went in for one more before she got in her car. We agreed to go out again on friday. I told her to be ready for 630 and the day of I would give her the details. Booked us a nice spot at a good resturant and then after a local hotel is putting on a christmas tree event where you walk around and peruse the trees then before you leave cast a vote for your fav. I think that will be fun and she will love it. She likes romatic stuff. 

One question is, is it appropriate to give her a single rose before the dinner? Or too much too soon? I like her and the pace things are moving at. She also hints at wanting to get physical on friday. A lot of sexual tension has been building over this last week so im excited for that of course but also a little worried...not overly endowed. Average. I know how to use it well, plus Im wicked with my mouth and other apendages. Past relationships it hasnt been an issue. Just dont want it to get physical and then she doesnet like it and then decides to cut ties. Shes a cool chick and we get a long super well. A lot in common. Same goals and values. Both single parents to children a year apart. Im a bigger dude. 6'1 265lb but always get told I dont look that heavy. Was a lot bigger a year ago at 352lb and still working on slimming down and living a healthier lifestyle!  Im active and carry my weight well and always seem to attract women out of my league somehow 😅. So thats a bonus i guess even though i focus on connection with a person vs solely on looks and attraction. Im not well versed in dating. In my early 30's right now and have only dated 4 women including this one. First relationship was a 9 year long term. Then a rebound that lasted about a week. And then took a 2 year break before dating another woman for about 4 months before I cut ties. And now this woman.

Also I'll be in town tomorrow. I live in a smaller community about 20 mins outside of her town but going to go get a few things to prep for friday. Was wanting to surprise her with a quick 5 mintue stop at her work place and bring her a starbucks. Should I just wait until friday? Or go through with the starbucks drop off?

But the moment I got my hands on the [new Tank Must](https://cartierwatchdupe.io/products/dupe-tank-must-solarbeat-watch-small-model-steel-case), that changed.

The first thing you notice is the refined case design — still the same classic 29.5mm × 22mm shape, but with softer, more fluid lines. The silvered dial, blue sword hands, and that signature blue spinel crown keep the DNA intact, yet somehow it feels more modern.

The grain-textured calf leather strap feels incredibly comfortable, and the quick-release system is a small touch that makes a big difference — I can switch straps in seconds.

Inside, it runs on a Swiss ETA quartz movement, precise and low-maintenance, which makes it perfect for everyday wear.

I was sooooooo happy that i couldn't even explain it in words, it was something magical, a feeling that made me so free from all the burdens and tensions. 

But fast forward, it was all going very well untill few days days when i went to his city (yes he went to another city for college) to surprise him, he surprised me with this another girl who's his batchmate. I have already seen this girl with him on his insta story but he told be that she's just a batchmate and they meet once in a while for a coffee and i was convinced. But when i got there in his apartment, i saw thst same girl moving out of the building so i confronted him about this and he that cheater accepted it and told me they both are dating since 3 fucking months.

My (M21) girlfriend (F23) has stated lately that I stress her out and that she can’t relax around me. We’ve been together for almost two years (Nov 19 is our anniversary) and I’m incredibly confused, she doesn’t give exact examples, says I’m needy, and that I’m selfish. Things are great honestly, love her to death and I want to marry her one day, when things are going great, they’re going amazing. Every once in a while something will happen, either she’ll get stressed out or I’ll say/do something that pisses her off and it all blows up, her first reaction is to state that I stress her out when I try to talk to her about it and she just wants me to shut up and not talk to her for a while. I do all the classic bf things, and do my best to cater to all love languages (quality time, physical affection, acts of service, gift giving, etc etc) this will typically occur in forms of cuddling, putting up the Xmas tree together, making sure her water bottle is filled or her bag is packed for school (both of us are in college), buying her coffee or lunch. I genuinely try my best to be the best partner I can for her and provide for her, I feel like I’m selfless and put her above all of my needs (this might be a personal flaw…I’m aware…) but when it all falls down her first reaction is that I stress her out. Specific example, earlier today (or yesterday depending on how you look at it) we had roughly a 1.5hr break between classes, she springs a coffee run on me, I was happy to comply (she’s very spontaneous, and I’m more planner, but she feels loved when we do spontaneous things together so I’m trying to be better about it) after coffee, she wants to go back to her place to eat lunch, nbd, it’s whatever, we go to her place to grab lunch, and now the time is roughly 12:30, both have class at 1:25, I don’t think much of it thinking it’ll be quick to eat lunch then go back to campus (I had a lunch packed at a staff lounge since I work part time as campus faculty) time slowly slips away, and even after I had mentioned and she was aware I had lunch packed, it’s 12:45/50, she asks if I want anything and I mention that I’ll eat if I have time before class when we get back, she freaks out and feels bad she didn’t think of me, but I reassure her that it’s fine (which it was, I really didn’t mind). This is just one example of how I put her first, but it’s constant with how I put her first, which I don’t mind cause that’s how I show love. We don’t live together and I feel like I don’t ask for a lot (a lot of evenings are spent together, roughly 8-9p or later, simply because of how busy we both are) and often we get 2-3 hours/day max, I know that seems like a lot but many nights throughout the week it’s 1hr or less, which I’m totally ok with too, I understand we’re busy. I don’t understand how I stress her out and wish I knew so that I could be better for her, I feel like I’m justified in my ask to spend time with her since we are in a relationship, but lately it seems like she thinks I’m a burden, even when she reassures me I’m not. She’s a wonderful human being most of the time, but when something happens she goes straight towards tearing me down. She’s had a troubled past with her family and she tells me she’s aware that she says hurtful things on purpose, and that’s how she wants to make sure I know that she’s hurting, as this is how she was raised. She’s told me she feels bad when she does it but she doesn’t know any other way to communicate how she’s feeling, she’s told me she’s working on it and I have seen progress, so I know she cares and she’s trying to be better. I plan on talking to her about all this tomorrow and will update accordingly, I just feel so confused and lost especially when we planned to spend this evening together and have our “weekly relationship check in” (this would’ve been the only time today we got to spend time just the two of us together) but when it came time to do so she just yelled at me cause a mutual friend was pissed off and wanted to spend time with her but “it’s always what I need” and never “about anyone else” even though we had this plan first and we normally do it in the AM and she felt really bad for pushing it back when she had a meeting come up but then when we kept pushing it back it seems like she just got burdened by it. 

TLDR: GF(23F) states that I (21M) stress her out but doesn’t tell me why, things are normally really great, but occasionally when a large amount of stress is present or I do something that pissed her off it blows up and that’s her first go to, that she can’t relax with me cause she’s always catering to my needs cause I’m selfish and needy and never put her first even though I do everything in my power to do things for her, show her love, and put her above all else. She says hurtful things on purpose to get her point across and she’s aware of that flaw and is working on it. I don’t ask for more than 2-3 hours/day together and often get less than that and I’m ok with it.

**I miss my husband so goddamn much.**



I (35M) divorced my husband (36M) three years ago. And God, I miss him. I asked for a divorce for a few reasons, most of which being that his depression got exponentially worse day after day and he refused to seek treatment. Sometimes he wouldn't even go into work and ended up getting fired from his job. I stayed with him for so fucking long, praying that one day he would start trying to get better. It was all I ever wanted, but that day didn't come. I sobbed the entire time signing those papers, and when I handed them to him and asked for a divorce, he just gave me the emptiest, deadest look and signed them without a word. My heart felt like it had been shattered with a hammer, anger and sadness and fear tied together in the world's tightest, ugliest knot and inset deep into my chest.

I put on a brave face for my friends, tried to frame it as shackles coming off and a new beginning, but it was a lie. It just hurt, and it keeps hurting, and it will never stop hurting. He was my soulmate. I'll never love anyone like I loved him. He used to be so sweet and loving, so passionate and happy and every other wonderful thing a man could want from another.

They say each day gets easier, but it isn't for me. It's been three years and I'm still reaching over to the other side of the bed in the morning to pull him close, and it always stings when my hands touch fabric and not his skin. It's been three years and I'm still expecting to see his car in the driveway when I get home from work. It's been three years and my heart isn't any less broken than the day he left.

I've been stalking his socials, I'll admit. He's been getting back to the gym, started meds, and I see him smiling so genuinely in these photos. He looks so incredible. Maybe if I had just waited, he would have changed his mind and went to a doctor like he is now? Or was it me that held him down? Was I making it worse?

I hope not. I wanna go over to his place and just fall into his arms and beg him to take me back. Maybe he's wishing the same thing about me. If there's even a chance I could have my boy back I feel like I should try. I'll never know otherwise.

EDIT: One: I am a homosexual man. My husband is a homosexual man. I am not a woman. Yes, I know I'm effeminate and kind of emotional. Get creative.

Two: my husband was a binge drinker. He refused treatment no matter how much I begged. We got antidepressants but he wouldn't take them. I know he's started meds now because he's posted about them and his 2 yrs sober chip that he got last month.

Three: I never stopped loving him. I never loved him any less. Near the end of our marriage, I started drinking to cope. The second I realized I was, I realized he was dragging me down with him, and I couldn't help him anymore. I didn't dip the second it got hard. Many of you are being kind of rude. I'll accept that I wasn't the perfect husband, nobody is. But claims that I never loved him are just wrong and make me feel sick to my stomach.

EDIT 2: No, I am not the catalyst for this. His depression started when his young brother died terribly and unexpectedly. It's not because he just hated me so much. We were childhood sweethearts and had been together for years when this happened.

**Significant-Noise212**

*Sometimes, people just cannot progress until they hit rock bottom, and maybe you leaving was that for him. It doesn't necessarily mean you held him down, he just couldn't find the desire and motivation to progress while you were holding him. Don't beat yourself up. It wasn't your fault he was sick and didn't want to ask for help. In the end, we all need to want that help, without it all other people' efforts are worthless. In the end, if you ended amicably, you can always hit him up and ask how he feels. Maybe he'll ignore you, maybe not, but you'll now you've tried. And stop stalking him. That is keeping you from healing.*

>OOP: Thank you, I needed to hear a lot of this. Maybe I'll call him just to see how he's doing. He doesn't hate me, I know that much. I'd like to see him regardless.

*The shock of divorce probably forced him to change. Chances are if you still stayed together, he would be the same.*



**Update - 3 days later**



Well, with Reddit's advice, I did it. A few days ago, I called my (35M) ex-husband (36M) whom I divorced after 6 years when he refused to seek treatment for his depression.

I called him later in the evening. It was the first time we'd spoken since a bit of trouble he'd had while he was still drinking 2 1/2 years ago. He picked up on the second ring. Our conversation was a little stilted at first, as to be expected, but he said he was really glad to hear from me. We ended up meeting up for coffee yesterday as so many of you suggested. I'll admit: it was kind of hard to see him, but in a good way? He looked so much better than the last time I had seen him, but he looked exactly like the man I married. He had put off a ton of weight (he gained like 75ish pounds during his struggle with depression, and before some dick says so, I didn't leave him because of his weight gain), he looked way healthier and very put together. I'll just say it: he looked incredibly hot. What made it hard was that I couldn't kiss him hello like I used to. But God, the way his eyes lit up when he saw me, I barely needed to.

We got our coffee and sat, and he updated me a little on his life in the last 3 years.

What really turned his life around was in part the divorce but moreso a DUI (nobody was hurt, he was caught a few blocks from his apartment). He's since gone to rehab and AlAnon, gotten his license back, and had to use a breathalyzer whenever he started his car for a while. He hasn't had a drop of alcohol since and I told him I was so fucking proud of him. He's also started antidepressants, and made a point of telling me that they're not SSRIs, but when I asked what that meant he got embarrassed and told me nevermind (???). Bottom line is that they've been helping him, he's back to being a gym rat, and he's almost completely turned his life around. This was around the point I started tearing up. It just felt so good knowing he was okay. Better than okay, he was *good*.

I also apologized to him for not sticking by him. He cut me off and said I had nothing to apologize for. He was a wreck, and I was being dragged down with him. That also felt good to hear. I apologized for not contacting him much during the last 3 years. That apology, he accepted.

He was dating someone for a few months, too. He broke up with him once he tried to get him to drink on New Year's. He seemed dismissive of the guy. Guess it wasn't too serious.

We got up and went on a walk after a few hours, and I think we both realized it felt like a first date. I had to stop myself from trying to hold his hand at a few points, I'll admit. We ended up sitting on a bench in a nearby park, and I confessed.

I told him I missed him more than anything, how I never stopped loving him, and how if he wanted to, I'd love to try again from the beginning this time. We'd go to couples' therapy, keep our heads above the water, and take it slow. He was quiet for a minute before he told me something. He said he was doing better now, but there may be a time where he sunk low again. Depression isn't easily cured, and he was far from cured. He still had bad days, but he said there would be one difference: he promised he would never stop trying to improve. He was never going to give up like he did before, and refused to neglect me like he used to. If I was willing to accept that truth, he was willing to try again. I agreed, and he pulled me into an embrace and snuck a kiss to my temple. You know when it's the first warm day of spring after a cold, harsh winter, and the soft breeze and basking sun hit your skin at the same time? It felt something like that, to the 1000th degree. After a while he walked me back to my car and squeezed my hand goodbye, and the second I got inside I started sobbing like a baby. Happy tears, though.

I'm currently sitting in bed, kicking my feet like a teenage girl, texting him back and forth to schedule an actual date. He said he'd plan everything, and try his best to make up for the birthdays and anniversaries he missed. He said it would ""knock my socks off."" What a dork. I love being in love. Not gonna lie, this is gonna be a bit hard to explain to my friends and family. Not looking forward to those conversations, but right now I don't care. My man loves me.

Thank you to everyone who had kind words to say, and all the people that messaged me with sympathy and advice. I hope we all find happiness, and love if we want it. I never would have made the leap if y'all hadn't encouraged me. Best of luck to all of you, and sorry for the overly flowery language <3

*I knew a woman who divorced her husband for the same reasons. They’d had 3 kids, one whom was mentally ill. Married for 25 years. She was tired of covering up for him, dealing with his shit. He was losing clients, etc. So she kicked him to the curb. Three years later, he’d gotten sober, counseling. They remarried. She loved the person, not the drunk.*

**1 New Update - 3 days later**

My (35M) ex-husband (36M) and I recently reconnected. I won't go over the details of why we split or our reconciliation since I'm sure the average redditor can click buttons and most likely read. He was the one taking me out, and promised that it would, in his words, ""knock my socks off"" to make up for his neglect of me. He sure as hell delivered.

A little backstory, we've been together since we were 15 and 16 respectively, and have never moved out of our hometown. This year would have been our 20th anniversary (of getting together, not marriage). We were dating secretly for about five years before our parents caught us one day during summer break. The fallout from finding out their son was gay actually made his parents split. His dad wanted to send him away to conversion therapy. He's seen his father maybe once per year on average, and every time he's incredibly cold towards me. Would never refer to me as his son-in-law, only my husband's ""pal."" I wonder why. Anyway, not what you're here to read. I'll get on with the lore.

He picked me up from the house and wouldn't tell me where we were going, but told me to dress warmly. He ended up taking me to the place where we met: a run down ice skating rink in our town. He used to do hockey, and I spent some time trying to learn figure skating until people started beating me up for it. Both sports would practice at the same time and I remember barely being able to keep my eyes off him. We went skating, I tried to pull off a few of the moves I remembered (he only had to catch me from falling on my ass once or twice, and I won't complain about an attractive man that I love hooking his arm around my waist), and we spent an hour or so there until our feet hurt. At one point I said that my face was getting cold, so he skated around in front of me and placed his gloved hands on my cheeks to warm me up. I just about burned a hole in the ice from how hard I was blushing, I swear to God.

He wasn't done then. We left and went to dinner, specifically the restaurant where we had our first date. It's a cheap hole-in-the-wall place, seeing as we were poor teenagers when we first met. We chatted and ate food that probably took 5 years off our lives, he was an incorrigible flirt, and even held my hand underneath the table like he did all those years ago. I know I said I never stopped loving him, and I stand by that, but I think I somehow fell in love with him a thousand times over again during that meal.

At the end of dinner, he asked if I had energy for one more simple thing, to which I agreed. He took me a while out of town to a dark sky zone park, specifically the one where he proposed to me ten years ago. He set out a blanket to sit on and another to cuddle under, and we went stargazing all bundled up together. You never know how much you miss the sound of someone's heartbeat until you haven't heard it for so long. We shared a bottle of sparkling grape juice in plastic champagne flutes and dumb, giggly kisses. It felt so similar yet so different. He told me in a moment of quiet that he loved me, and oh, God. It took everything I had not to cry. I barely hesitated before asking if he wanted to change venues. He seemed surprised, but eagerly accepted.

I ended up at his place, as some of you may have seen from my edit on my second post yesterday. I wanted to take it slower than this, but it was so hard to. I was so starved of affection and hadn't been intimate with anyone for just about six years. I'm gonna keep what happened at his between us, but all I'll say is that his medication was no issue and all of you should be jealous. I woke up in his bed this morning, reached over for him, and pulled him close just like I used to do. I haven't been this happy in a long time. We had a sleepy discussion and decided to get back together, but we're not using the term boyfriends. It just feels weird after all this time. So he's my partner, or my lover. He's mine.

Thank you, reddit. Wouldn't have done it without a little push from the internet. Let's see where all this goes.

His birthday was in August, and mine was the 11th of this month. It fell on a Tuesday which was awesome because we both have Tuesdays off together. For his birthday, he wanted to go get a new xbox controller, go to lunch, and go bowling with his friends and I. 
That’s what we did. It was an incredibly fun day, I got him a couple gifts I knew he’d like, I baked and decorated him a cake (a hobby of mine), we went to his favorite place for lunch, and we went bowling with like six of his buddies. 
For my birthday, I woke up excited because I love my birthday. I never really got to celebrate it as a child so I’ve made a point to celebrate it and make it MY special day as an adult. I planned the whole day out down to the last detail. I wanted to wake up, watch a few episodes of my favorite show, go to Ihop for lunch because I love Ihop, go get my nails and lashes done, and then I wanted to go roller skating just R and I. 
R woke up about an hour after I did, went to the bathroom, and I waited for him to tell me happy birthday, and he didn’t. He got a cup of coffee and hopped right on his game. 
I went to the bedroom where his computer was, and I said, “aren’t you forgetting something?” to which I was blatantly ignored. 
That REALLY hurt my feelings. I’d been talking about my birthday for 2 weeks at that point. How could he forget? 
I went back to the living room and watched my show for another couple hours, and at this point, it was like 3pm, and I was ready to go do what I wanted to do so I walked back into the bedroom and said, “Babe you’ve been playing for hours now. It’s my birthday, and I’d like to go to lunch and to go get my nails and lashes done.” to which he responded with, “Oh yeah, happy birthday. I’m feeling really tired today baby.” and then kept playing. 
He’s never made a super big deal over anyone’s birthdays, but he’s never been THIS dismissive of mine. I feel incredibly hurt, and this honestly kinda made me lose any attraction I had for him right now, and I am deadass considering dumping him over it. It was incredibly rude and disrespectful. I just feel like I did my best to make sure he had the birthday he wanted, I worked hard on his cake, bought him gifts, carpooled multiple of his friends, etc and he didn’t give a shit about my birthday.

My actual goal was far simpler: I just wanted to stop micro-managing every single one of my side hustles.

My first foray into automation began with a basic reminder. I simply scheduled a weekly alert for Fridays to relist a handful of Etsy products that were losing visibility. This minimal effort, taking barely two minutes, proved surprisingly effective at preventing a significant drop in traffic.

Next, I integrated auto-scheduling for Pinterest. I simply took my existing designs, configured them to loop every few weeks, and pushed them out. There was no specific optimization. Yet, these automatically recycled posts began generating a consistent flow of clicks.

My next step involved a more technical approach: I developed a simple script to programmatically reindex older blog pages via Google’s API. While it sounds complex, its primary purpose was to automate a task I disliked performing manually. Once confirmed operational, I promptly ceased thinking about it.

This pattern became a clear directive, every instance of successful automation stemmed from a reluctance to perform repetitive, unstimulating tasks manually.

So now, the Etsy listings just auto-renew, the pins repost themselves, the old pages get reindexed... and this little ecosystem just keeps generating a handful of random sales or clicks each week. It's never anything massive, but it totally adds up, enough for coffee, a nice little rent buffer, and honestly, a whole lot of peace of mind.

Everyone out there talks about 'passive income' like it's this glorious, sprawling system you build once and then, boom, you retire to a beach. For me? It's way more like a messy pile of half-automated chores that just quietly chug along in the background while I'm off doing literally anything else.

It's undoubtedly chaotic, lacking any aesthetic appeal, and occasionally requires troubleshooting. Yet, its consistent contribution to my rent makes it entirely satisfactory.

1ovubqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicDating/comments/1ovubqa/1st_first_date_question_dump/,1st First Date Question dump,"For context, I am 24m and have never formally asked anyone out or even gone on a date before. I plan on asking a girl out after mass this coming Sunday due to her showing (what I perceive as) signs of interest. I am a chronic overthinker and potentially slightly on the spectrum (cliche engineer).

What are good first date ideas? I know that people usually recommend coffee or ice-cream, but it feels like those are 15-30min activities; hardly enough time to get to know someone (and I dont drink coffee). Is the assumption that these could turn into a walk? Should I choose a location accordingly? Is it improper/non-preferable to ask what she'd like to do?

That brings me to dress code. For something casual, like one of the above options, it seems like being dressed even somewhat formally (smart/business casual) would be out of place. I know that it is important to be ""put together"", but when people say ""be well dressed"", is this with the assumption that it is a more formal dinner date? And for first dates like these, is it assumed that these only happen on the weekends? It seems like these would be best done during daylight, which is hard to find on weekdays during the Winter months with 9-5 work.

As for greetings, are there any expectations for the guy that I should be aware of? Is complimenting her appeance (""you looked pretty"") on the first date expected, or uncomfortable? Am I expected to scramble to pull out her chair, even in an informal setting?

As for conversation, I am not actually as concerned about this. I am a self-certified yapper and am pretty good at helping other people (even strangers) yap about themselves for hours. Are there topics that should specifically be avoided? Should the conversation be geared in a way that is as if it's just 2 adults getting to know each other, or should it have a slight relationship bias to the topics. If there is fundamental non-compatibilities that don't come out in small talk or ""medium"" talk, it would be nice to know of them sooner rather than later.

Lastly, people say to keep excitement high but expectations low for the first date. HOW? This is clearly a first date, which naturally makes you think that this could be the start of something bigger. Being Catholic, we know that all dating is supposed to have marriage as the end-goal, so how do you not have that prominently in your mind going into the first date? What mental tricks do you use to keep yourself from having too high of expectations?

I know I'm an overthinker and that I am counting my chickens before they've hatched, but you've got to trust me when I say that having these questions answered will bring me comfort for this potential date or for potential future first dates to come.

1ovuaf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pyrotechnics/comments/1ovuaf3/blackmatch_and_star_prime_questions/,Blackmatch and star prime questions.,"I have a few questions about blackmatch and prime for stars. I've tried to find information online, but I get somewhat conflicting results so I thought I'd ask here. 

When making blackmatch, should the powder be milled or not? In fireworking 101 Ned used only screen mixed powder, but I've seen others recommend using the fastest powder you can. Did Ned skip milling the powder only because he said the series wont require a ball mill, or does using non milled powder have benefits?

My second question is about binder. I've seen people use nothing at all, dextrin, gum arabic, NC lacquer, PVA glue and possibly something else as well. What are the benefits of each and which gives a good balance between performance and durability? I only plan to use black match for quick match, I use visco as my primary fuse.

Thirdly, I have been having some trouble lighting stars that need to be primed. I tried priming them with fast black powder, but while the black powder is good enough to light the stars, after rolling even the black powder doesn't want to ignite - is it possible that the stars get too smooth after rolling in milled powder?

Should non milled powder be used, so the charcoal is more ""fluffy"" and picks up fire better? I've heard using diatomaceous earth helps, but I cant get that at the moment. I've also tried using about 5 % fine sawdust (sawdust in a coffee grinder then screened), but I'm not sure that helped. I've also seen some people recommend adding 5-10% dark Al to prime, for hotter burn.",2,1763016625.0,Pyrotechnics,0,1.0,False

Hi Everyone - I wanted your feedback on a company I started - Node with the idea that email was for personal communication and not commercial.  

Most of the Gmail discussions I’ve been seeing is about trying to ‘hide your email’ or keeping your spam away etc, creating a “+” alias, then having challenges on replying, or creating multiple ‘junk boxes’ - basically trying to figure out hacks to solve an underlying structural problem.

Email was never meant for commerce - it was meant for personal communication and is not for personal documentation - not commerce. 

we need is a redesign for how communication, safety, privacy and convenience can all prevail.

So we created a commerce app (data only stored on your phone - so it’s also private by design).  Everything you need to - receipts, offers, messages, subscriptions, updates etc - is  just a tap away (like tapping your phone at a coffee shop) - all spam and phishing free. 

You download Node - Your Personal Commerce Assistant  (only available on App Store) and there is no sign ups and no passwords at all.  You get an @nodeconnects.com commerce token that can be used anywhere an email is accepted - and all your shopping messages (online or offline), get instantly organized by the brands you trust.  

Let me know what you think about this. This is about changing how we interact with commerce and not trying to use a broken system (email) that was never meant for commerce. 

If you do want to try it then it’s available on App Store and you can search for ’node commerce’.

Hi all. Looking for some friendly guidance.

I’ve been using a Siemens EQ500 for about five years. It has been decent but nothing spectacular. It has now developed a fault and Siemens have quoted £260 to repair it, which feels steep for a machine of this age.

I’m thinking this might be the right moment to upgrade, but the number of options is a bit overwhelming and it is easy to convince myself I need a full £2k dual boiler setup.

I’d really appreciate advice on two things:

• What would feel like a meaningful upgrade from the EQ500
• Whether a dual boiler actually adds real value for my needs

For context, I make mostly milk based drinks at home, with the occasional espresso or long black, and I do make coffees for guests from time to time.

1ovu8nz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ovu8nz/aita_for_having_code_enforcement_come_back_to/,AITA for having code enforcement come back to cite/ticket my husband for our yard?,"Hey, first time posting but I need perspective. Names changed and rather long and bits may not be extremely relevant besides to provide a bit of context (I am neurodivergent and dont always know what context is important)

I Alex (35f) live with my husband Terence (37m), 1 year married but a total of 8 years together. We also have my eldest from another relationship (12f) and our two kids together (3f and 1f). I am a sahm and in charge of budgeting, shopping, planning, prepping, scheduling, meal planning, appointments, kids activities and extracurriculars and anything else the kids or Terence might need... even waking up at 3:30 am to be a human alarm clock because Terence often sleeps through his alarms and needs to be at work at 5am. Terence works 40 hours total Thursday through Sunday (overtime isn't allowed) he loves to cook so makes dinner 3x a week, does his work laundry, lifts the heavy things and ""does the yard.""

I do my best to be laid back and not ""make"" my husband do things around the house on his days off because he needs time to unwind, I also don't ask for much on weekends because he works. They are more gentle nudges to clean up messes he has made, not mine or the childrens.

Terence specifically asked for great equipment to upkeep the yard and said he will absolutely use the equipment. I heavily researched and purchased a mower, weed wacker, edger, and leaf blower along with back up batteries, shelvesand a charging station. Then I bought gardening gloves for the whole family, weed pullers, kneeling mats, weed killer, bug barrier, ant killer, sprayers... the whole 9 yards, 2 years ago. Since then I (not Terence) have been cited twice for the state of the yard. I eventually worked out our budget and started paying for someone else to come do our yard for us every 3 weeks.

Over the past 3 months Terence has refused to let them work on our yard (there was a snafu when our regular guy scheduled his cousin to come in his place and the cousin never showed) and said he will do it himself since he has the equipment. I have maintained the yard maintenance budget the whole time so we could contact our usual guy at any moment when my husband agreed.

We have had weeds growing like crazy in the last 3 months. Goat heads, foxtails, stickers etc along our sidewalk, which is embarrassing and irritating since I park my car on the curb and have to shuffle my kids whenever we have to leave the house or when we come home. Not to mention the 5 ft weeds in the alley behind our house. I kept telling him the yard needed to get done and that I didn't want to get another citation. He kept assuring me he would do it, plan for it, put it in the calendar, over and over again. But then he made excuses or was playing video games on his days off and loses track of time.

Anyway, today (wednesday) my husband swapped shifts with a coworker to have tomorrow off instead so he wasn't home. And I decided to try locating a torch through some local facebook groups to take care of burning down the irritating goatheads and foxtails making my husbands job that much easier.

An officer came to my door not long after posting for the torch. I started shaking because I was so mad that my husband had promised over and over that he would do the yard and hadnt followed through. I told the officer I had been trying to get the yard taken care of, I offered to show him the posts about burning the weeds, he kindly walked me through what I have to do for that to be legal in town (which I already knew as a chronic planner). He then said he still had to issue the citation.

I told him I wouldn't accept it because it is my husbands responsibility and I shouldn't be cited for his empty promises again. The officer said he could tell I was upset and that he could come back when my husband is home. I gave the officer Terences info and he will be back with the citation on Friday. I even added it to Terence calendar.

Terence is now upset with me, (he never would cakk me an asshole because we don't ever call one another names) but he is pretty ticked off about getting a citation.

So the question is AITA for scheduling the receipt of a citation for Terence and sparing myself?

Clarification- the citation payment still comes out of our joint funds, it is a symbolic gesture to give it to Terence.

Understand What’s Really on Your Plate,"**Disclaimer:** *This post is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for personalized dietary guidance.*

Hello everyone,

The [Soula Care - AI designed for female emotional health, support and care](https://soula.care) team here. We often talk about the powerful ways lifestyle impacts our stress hormones, but what we put on our plates plays a starring role. While stress management techniques are crucial, you might be unknowingly sabotaging your efforts with your diet.

***The connection is simple:*** *certain foods can cause spikes in your blood sugar, trigger inflammation, or overstimulate your nervous system, all of which signal your body to release more* ***cortisol****.*

Understanding which foods can drive up your cortisol is a game-changer for taking control of your hormonal health. Let’s take a look at what usually ends up on your plate.

**1. Refined Sugar and High-Fructose Corn Syrup**

This is public enemy number one for cortisol balance. When you eat a sugary snack or drink, your blood sugar skyrockets. Your body then releases insulin to bring it down. If it drops too quickly (a ""sugar crash""), your body perceives this as an emergency and releases cortisol to mobilize more energy, starting the cycle all over again.

* **Where it hides:** Soda, candy, pastries, sweetened yogurts, many breakfast cereals, and even seemingly healthy items like flavored coffee drinks and granola bars.
* **The Science:** A study published in *Clinical Endocrinology* found that consuming a high-sugar diet can disrupt the sensitive feedback system that controls cortisol secretion, leading to dysregulation. [Read the study here.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26294005/)

**2. Highly Refined Carbohydrates**

Foods made with white flour act very similarly to sugar in your body. They are quickly broken down into glucose, causing the same rapid spike and crash in blood sugar that prompts a cortisol response.

* **Where it hides:** White bread, white pasta, white rice, bagels, crackers, and other processed baked goods.
* **The Science:** Research indicates that a high-glycemic diet is associated with increased cortisol levels. Choosing low-glycemic, high-fiber foods helps maintain stable blood sugar and a calmer hormonal state.

**3. Excessive Caffeine**

For many of us, that morning cup of coffee is a ritual. However, caffeine is a stimulant that directly stimulates the adrenal glands to produce more cortisol. The key here is **excess** and **timing**. A coffee or two in the morning might be fine, but consistently drinking it throughout the day-especially on an empty stomach-can keep your cortisol elevated.

* **Where it hides:** Coffee, black tea, energy drinks, and some sodas.
* **The Science:** A study from *Psychosomatic Medicine* showed that caffeine can increase cortisol secretion, even in people who are habitual coffee drinkers, and the effect is amplified by psychological stress. [Read the study here.](https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/abstract/2002/07000/effects_of_caffeine_on_plasma_cortisol,.12.aspx)

**4. Fried Foods and Trans Fats**

Foods cooked in unhealthy oils at high temperatures (like most fried foods) can promote inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation is a significant physical stressor, and your body responds to it by releasing cortisol.

* **Where it hides:** French fries, donuts, fried chicken, margarine, and many processed snack foods.
* **The Science:** While direct studies on trans fats and cortisol are limited, we know that trans fats are strongly pro-inflammatory. [The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health notes that trans fats cause systemic inflammation.](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/types-of-fat/transfats/) Since inflammation is a cortisol trigger, it's a clear connection.

**5. Alcohol**

Alcohol is a double-whammy. It can initially act as a sedative, but as your body works to metabolize it, it disrupts your sleep architecture-particularly the restorative deep sleep stages. Poor sleep is one of the most potent triggers for high cortisol the next day.

* **The Science:** Research has shown that alcohol consumption can increase nocturnal cortisol levels and disrupt the normal diurnal rhythm of the hormone. [An article in *Alcohol Research & Health* reviews this relationship.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23584136/)

**What's the Common Thread? Instability.**

The foods that raise cortisol tend to create **instability** in your body-whether it's unstable blood sugar, an overstimulated nervous system, or increased inflammation.

At **Soula Care**, we believe the goal isn't perfection or elimination; it's **awareness and balance**. You don't need to never eat these foods again. Instead, try these shifts:

* **Pair and Prepare:** If you have a refined carb, pair it with protein, fiber, and healthy fat. For example, have white pasta with a lentil Bolognese and a side salad. This slows down the blood sugar spike.
* **Time Your Caffeine:** Enjoy your coffee with or after a balanced breakfast, and try to cut it off by early afternoon.
* **Focus on Addition:** Instead of focusing on what to remove, focus on adding more whole, anti-inflammatory foods like leafy greens, berries, nuts, and fatty fish.

By understanding what's on your plate, you can make empowered choices that support your hormonal harmony, reduce stress on your body, and move you toward lasting well-being.

so i've analyzed all my videos that ""worked"" vs the ones that felt forced, and i found patterns in what i was saying

**the key: casual past-tense + sensory details**

your brain believes CASUAL more than DRAMATIC

**bad example (too forced):** ""oh my god babe i love you so much, you're so amazing, i'm so grateful we're together, this is the best relationship ever""

why it doesn't work: too performative, your brain knows you're acting

**good example (casual):** ""ugh i'm so tired... thanks for making dinner tonight babe. that thai place you picked was so good, i'm definitely getting the same thing next time""

why it works: sounds like a real phone video someone would take. mundane. boring even. your brain accepts boring as real

**the patterns that worked best for me:**

1. **Casual complaints/observations**
   * ""i need to do laundry, we've been going out so much lately lol""
   * ""babe you left your stuff all over the bathroom again""
   * ""remind me to text your mom back""
2. **Sensory + specific details**
   * ""that restaurant smelled so good when we walked in""
   * ""your hands were so cold when you grabbed mine earlier""
   * ""i can still taste that coffee we got""
3. **Future references (casual, not desperate)**
   * ""what time is your mom expecting us on sunday?""
   * ""we should probably leave by 6 if we want good seats""
   * ""remind me to grab that thing for next weekend""
4. **Inside jokes / callback references**
   * ""you're doing that thing again"" *laughs*
   * ""remember when you said that last week? so funny""
   * ""okay but this reminds me of that time...""

**why this language works:**

your brain accepts the MUNDANE. it believes boring domestic details. it doesn't believe dramatic declarations

also - notice how all of these imply a HISTORY. ""again"" ""last week"" ""next time"" = your brain assumes context, assumes this relationship has been happening

**length & style:**

* 15-60 seconds per video (like a casual story/vlog)
* talking TO someone vs performing FOR camera
* phone camera quality, not produced
* you can be in your room, your car, wherever - just looks like a casual video

**the thing nobody talks about:**

you can make MULTIPLE short videos and just... cycle through them. i had like 8-10 different videos i'd rotate through. kept it from getting stale

**tomorrow in Part 3:** how OFTEN to watch, the consumption schedule that worked, and what to do when you ""don't feel like it""

**assignment for today:**

make ONE 20-second video using the casual language pattern. just one. you don't even have to watch it yet, just make it and see how it feels

then come back and tell me: did casual feel easier than trying to ""feel it real""? 👇",1,1763016216.0,PowerOfVisualisation,0,1.0,False

and you don’t,
not in any way that lasts past morning.

Still, there was a gravity in you,
a quiet pull I recognized
the kind of presence
that leaves a trace behind
long after the moment goes.

⸻

We laughed about nothing,
that easy, drifting nothing
that only exists between people
who owe each other nothing at all.

You offered the first small truths
not heavy, but vulnerable
the kind that open a door
without announcing an invitation.

So I let a few of mine slip out,
pieces I keep tucked
where few look.
I waited for the sting.
It never came.
It simply didn’t matter to you.

⸻

It wasn’t the night
it was the looseness of it,
the slack in me
I hadn’t felt in years.

You weren’t gentle;
you were perceptive
in a way that felt almost sharp
a gaze that cut clean lines
through whatever I pretended to be.

Not unkind
just unnervingly accurate.

⸻

Maybe that’s why the next moment
slipped past my guard.

We were reading aloud,
words moving between us
light as breath,
when your hand found my leg
steady, certain,
as if the gesture had been waiting
for its place in the evening.

And not until later
did your fingers reach my face,
brushing hair behind my ear,
touching me like someone
memorizing something
they knew wouldn’t last.

You noticed everything.
I noticed you noticing.

⸻

We made a choice
that left its weight on me,
and I’m still carrying it.

Later, alone,
I cried in a way that startled me
not dramatic,
just a sudden shattering
of something I once thought solid.

⸻

Days passed.
I stepped into the cold
and let the air straighten my spine.

I ran and felt my voice return.
I danced down a sidewalk
with coffee warming my hands
like a promise I’d forgotten
I could give myself.

⸻

And in this unraveling
this slow, honest peeling-back
I’m meeting the part of myself
I tucked away for safekeeping.

The part that wants to feel fully,
to shape the ache into something,
to grow toward the person
I keep meaning to become.

It hurts
but the hurt feels like direction.

⸻

Waking up is strange like that:
the clarity,
the tremor of what comes next,
uneasy about the work ahead,
yet grateful
for the chance
to rise into it.

I don’t know you,
not really.
But for a moment
a brief crossing in borrowed time
we met between strangers,
and something in me
moved that needed to.

How did everything pass by so quickly?

You don't even feel 27.

You still feel like that 17 year old kid who thought they had all the time in the world.

But somehow, 10 years just disappeared. And you start missing the past. The feeling of being young, excited, and clueless.

But then you realize, one day, you'll miss this, too.

Being 18, being confused, being tired, but still trying.

So maybe the trick is to slow down a bit and actually live this chapter before it also becomes just another memory.

The point is no matter what age you are, you’ll miss these days. Life gets busy sometimes and it’s always a good time to stop and smell the roses

When someone asks ""tumhare liye definition of life kya hai?"" it's hard to answer immediately—unless you're used to such questions. Not everyone has the logic or curiosity to ask what really drives your thinking.But for me, the answer was always clear.Life was never about being rich, good-looking, famous, or owning cars, gadgets, and expensive clothes. It wasn't about following social media trends or pretending to be someone I'm not. It was always about being happy with what I had—the people around me and everything else that came with it .Looking back, I realize I ended up with the wrong people more times than I'd like to admit. If I'm being honest, I wasted a lot of time investing in them. But I don't regret it—I learned more from those experiences than I could have imagined .There's a different version of you that exists in everyone's mind. At some point, this stopped working for me because I was the same everywhere—no change in how I talked or behaved. And because of that, I lost a lot of people along the way .So here's the conclusion: I'm turning 18 tomorrow, and I have this obsession with sharing how I feel. And honestly, there's no better place than Reddit for that .I'm also thankful to Reddit—I've met some amazing people here and had some great experiences .

I am trying to determine the best features on an espresso machine for dialing in decaf coffee (Swiss water process). Researching an espresso machine for my wife's Christmas gift. Her favorite is a local roast of medium espresso beans. 

Features come to mind:

1. Precise Temperature control

2. Auto pre-infusion

3. Adjustable pressure

4. Flow control

What features are a must have vs useful vs not needed for getting the best out of decaf (Swiss water process)? 

For those who routinely drink decaf, what features have helped the most for improving your shots? 

There are are large range of espresso machines. I would like to find the ideal tier of machine to pull great decaf shots and occasional steaming.

For the past 8 years, I have been wanting to recreate this cafe con leche that I had in Havana at Cafe Archangel. It was a simple cafe con leche, but it was the most creamy, dark and round tasting milk coffee ever! I assume it is a shot of espresso (made with an espresso machine) with steamed milk.

I dont know if its the equipment, technique, or the coffee bean that in general made all the coffee I had in Cuba delicious, but I would love to make it at home!!

Any ideas?

Has anyone else had a huge improvement in their duration and quality of sleep since going sober?

I’m only on Day 17, but I was looking at my Fitbit app and the results are undeniable:
- Before quitting I was averaging a sleep score of 76 and duration of 6h50min
- Since quitting, it has increased almost overnight and maintained consistent with an average sleep score of 85 and duration of 8h05min

The first week I was having some trouble falling asleep and was tossing and turning a bit, but that has mostly passed thankfully. 

I wake up refreshed pretty much every day now and it’s been way easier for me to get out of bed and get to work on time with a good attitude.

I’m down from drinking 3 coffees every day to just 2 on workdays and 1 on weekends.

Would love to hear about everyone else’s sleep improvements and if you have any helpful tips to share please do!",6,1763014905.0,stopdrinking,4,1.0,False
