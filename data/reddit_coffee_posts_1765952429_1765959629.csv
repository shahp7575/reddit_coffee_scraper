*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

---

**Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
The Grand Rapids Griffins are the NHL’s version of a Roomba on a coffee table: unstoppable, relentless, and utterly indifferent to your pleas. Their decimal odds of **1.26-1.28** (implied probability: **78-79%**) suggest bookmakers view this game as less a contest and more a ceremonial victory lap. Iowa’s **3.35-3.55** odds (implied **28-29%**) are the hockey equivalent of betting on a penguin to fly—possible, but only in a metaphorical sense.

The Griffins’ 22-1-0-1 start (45 of 48 points) is historic, akin to a toaster winning a cooking competition. They’ve mastered every facet of hockey: **93 goals scored** (AHL-leading), **44 goals allowed** (fewest in the league), and goaltending so elite that their starters’ save percentages (.939 and .936) make a “save” look like an overused term. Even with key players like John Leonard (2025’s answer to a human puck magnet) recalled or injured, they’ve thrived. Iowa? They’re the hockey version of a “placeholder team,” and their stat line? A mystery solved only by the number “0.”

**Digest the News: Injuries, Depth, and a Touch of Absurdity**  
The Griffins are missing forwards Carter Mazur, Michal Postava, and Red Wings prospects Nate Danielson, Emmitt Finnie, and Axel Sandin-Pellikka. But here’s the kicker: They’ve responded by **winning in every conceivable way**—special teams, five-on-five chaos, and goaltending so good it makes a snowman in the Sahara jealous. Captain Dominik Shine, who recently hit 500 games (a milestone most humans achieve in careers), is scoring at an MVP pace. And their defense? Erik Gustafsson and Justin Holl are t

We just visited yesterday and it was awesome. Unless you’re planning to do all of the shows and want a lot of character photos, 5 hours is plenty of time. We did every ride we wanted and some of them twice.

We were not expecting to have snacks and drinks in the park included, but our guide had vouchers for us to spend, so we enjoyed some items along the way as well.

We booked the 11:00 am tour with dinner the day it became available on KKDay. I felt 11:00 was the earliest I wanted to commit to being in the park after having the included breakfast at our hotel without having to rush.

I read that not every VIP tour purchased gets confirmed, so I waited to buy the Studio Passes until I got the confirmation a few days after I ordered and paid for it. The tour and passes were booked with KKDay.

Finally the day comes and it is dry, but cold! Our guide was lovely. Her English was absolutely fine for being able to talk about what we wanted to do while in the park and she didn’t seem to mind that we walked a full two laps around the park because of one ride shutdown and a couple second-time rides at the end of the day.

I pulled up to my house so excited to surprise her. I walk in to the horror of seeing my wife puck prepping with our pool boy. She was sCREAMING “Tamp harder, harder!!” while he blind shook his grounds into her portafilter. 

To my surprise I actually felt the urge to start prepping my own portafilter while I watched. So as I watched them I quietly took out my portafilter and started puck prepping. I’ve never blind shook harder. 

After they tamped, he made sure her group head was nice and warm and slid his portafilter into the slot. Before you know it his shot was pre infusing earlier than expected, but he still managed to pull a viscous shot with a nice load of Crema into her pink notNeautral Vero glass. 

My wife proceeded to start purging his steam wand, I couldn’t believe that he managed to get a nice layer of foam to top off her cortado.

Once they were done, he smacked the grounds out of his portafilter into her knock box. By now, I have already over extracted my beans, producing a nice crema, and was simply just watching in awe.

To my surprise, he began consuming the crema, his own crema that he made, out of her pink notNeutral Vero glass. It was then that my wife looked up and saw me, she gasped seeing me with my portafilter out and already extracted. At that time, the pool boy turned around…. But then I suddenly realized… he wasn’t my pool boy.

Ever feel like you need a clone just to handle the chaos of expanding your business beyond Poland's borders? The thought of listing products on international marketplaces like eBay can be daunting. We're talking translation headaches, marketplace-specific requirements, and keeping track of stock levels. It's like a full-time job, right? But what if you could get an ""employee"" who works 24/7 without a coffee break?

Let's break it down into some chill, actionable steps:

1. **Automate Listings**: Look for tools that handle the heavy lifting for you, automating the process of listing products on platforms like eBay. It can save you countless hours.

2. **Translation Tools**: Use AI-powered translation to effortlessly adapt your item descriptions for different markets. No need to brush up on your high school language classes!

3. **Stock Management**: Keep an eye on stock across platforms to prevent overselling. Sync your inventory automatically to avoid any nasty surprises.

4. **Understand Market Requirements**: Familiarize yourself with the quirks and requirements of each platform. This can save you from costly errors in the future.

For those who are curious, Base offers some nifty features to streamline cross-border selling. It's like having a virtual assistant who's got your back, especially when it comes to automating those pesky listings and keeping everything in sync without a hitch.

The first time I ever had an anxiety attack was at 12. It felt like an electric current split across my brain/mind. 

I know understand this was a mechanism to protect me but it felt as though both sides of my brain had disconnected. 

This made reading, writing, the ability to communicate fully with someone and pick up nonverbal communication

It even affected things such as watching movies. 

Others have described feeling like they are floating just above or feel skewed/misaligned within their body and it felt somewhat like that. I felt as if I was floating somewhere within my mind. 

This lead to me feeling like my thoughts and emotions were physical things that I could move around within myself. The only way that I can maybe describe it is akin to hyperphantasia. 

This also lead to some thoughts feeling “sticky” which were anxiety and ocd induced thoughts that felt like they were sticking to me no matter how much I morphed them into something else or tried to throw them away.

I’ve cycled through almost every OCD subtype which is comforting in its own way but the OCD/anxiety shows up in a meta-cognitive, thought monitoring, mental/moral contamination, existential way 

One way was the thought that if I thought of a “bad” person I would somehow be contaminated and take on their bad traits. I would then have to think of a “good” person with admirable qualities to negate the bad one. 

I also dealt with constant obsessions with feeling like I was going to lose my mind and needed to be “aware” 

With the DP/DR/disassociation I deal with how my perception of reality is affected as well. 

This shows up in “right” and “wrong” 

“Right” is where I am able to be aware of my perception, I am able to think and communicate clearly. It can be described as discernment. 

“Wrong”  as an example is like today where I skipped breakfast and lunch and only had coffee at work. I was trialing a new ADHD med ( Dexedrine ) and began to reflect on the way each med had made me feel. I then got an intrusive thought that lead me to think about my perception. I became anxious and it felt as though I slipped into another reality. 

Trying to talk to people at work left me unable to understand them. Getting my words out in any clear sentence was hard because I didn’t feel connected to myself 

Since getting my diagnosis and starting meds they have been the only thing to stop my OCD and anxiety 

When my meds begin to crash though I’ll find symptoms coming back and feeling more prominent.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Vegas Golden Knights vs. New Jersey Devils: A Tale of Two Teams (One Healthy, the Other… Not)**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a game where the New Jersey Devils have more players listed as “out” than they do in the lineup. The Golden Knights, meanwhile, are rolling into Sin City like a well-oiled slot machine—consistent, reliable, and ready to *clink* another win into the jackpot. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a penguin in a tuxedo.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Vegas Isn’t Just a City, It’s a Team

The Golden Knights are listed at **-191** on the moneyline, implying a **\~65.6% implied probability** of victory. For context, that’s like betting the sun will rise tomorrow… in Nevada. The Devils (+158) offer a **\~38.8% chance**, which is about the same odds as your Uncle Bob remembering to bring his own coffee cup to the game.

Statistically, Vegas dominates:

* **Offense/Defense**: 6th in goals allowed (87) vs. New Jersey’s 20th (103). The Devils allow **3.1 goals per game**; the Golden Knights? A frugal **2.5**.
* **Goal Differential**: +8 for Vegas, -8 for New Jersey. It’s like the Devils’ defense watches a movie where “block the shot” is subtitled as “enjoy the popcorn.”
* **Injuries**: The Devils’ injury report reads like a cast list for *The Walking Dead*. **10 players out**, including star winger Timo Meier (personal issues) and Jack Hughes (finger injury). New Jersey’s lineup is so thin, they might have to call in the team’s mascot, the “Devils Dog,” to take faceoffs.

---

### News Digest: The Devils’ Roster vs. a Jenga Tower

The Devils’ recent news is less “hockey team” and more “survival documentary.” Key absences include:

* **Timo Meier** (out for personal reasons). Rumor has it he’s home perfecting his Christmas cookies… or tripping over his own shadow.
* **Jack Hughes** (finger injury). The Devils’ dynamic playmaker is sidelined, leaving New Jersey’s offense to operate like a toaster with a single working heating element.
* **Arseni Gritsyuk and Brett Pesce** (out with upper body injuries). Gritsyuk, drafted 12

Girl barely spoke. Very quiet, more gesturing than saying what she wants. I heard 4 words one after another: latte cappuccino, bueno donut, raspberry donut. But from experience i know this can be something totally different. So i repeated after her. She said only one coffee cappucino. I clarified the donut part.

 Now we have deal once a week: buy any pastry and you have coffee for like $0,5 if i checked exchange rate correctly. As her colegues find out they wanted to make one order with her. 

They spoke one through another, made huge chaos. One thing was to clarify terms of the deal to them (you can't buy one donut and have 3 coffies for almost free). The other was to hear what they want. I checked 2 more times if i got drinks and pastries right. Especially pastry part which seemed wrong. 

I once again read every single item to the girl and she confirmed. My mistake was they got deal with 3 coffies and only two pastries but it was like really chaotic i decided that's on me. I will pay more attention next time and let it go for now.

 They got their drinks. Few moments later they came back with receipt. Asked whats on it. As i answered they said that it should be only one donut. I explained my whole process of clarifying their order. Turns out the girl not only didn't understand. She just said yes every time like idk bc of habit? It was just her default answer i really don't get it. 

The guy was mad at her. He said unkindly to her NEXT TIME SAY NO THANK YOU WHEN SHE ASK A QUESTION. I mean. Even with extra donut they paid less than for 3 coffies at regular price and got them even when shouldn't bc of my mistake. At some point i even asked ""ok so two donuts and three drinks is that correct?"". WHAT HAPPENED. WHY SAY YES WHEN ITS NO.",2,1765958158.0,barista,0,0.75,False

While swiping through many profiles I paused as I came across the profile of a woman I had a single date with a year prior. 

We visited an art museum followed by coffee and great discussion and I was so enamored by her interest in literature and art. What I thought was to be a 30 minute conversation opining on the art we saw lasted a little over 2 hours just having a natural-flow conversation on life and ambition. I was most enamored with her eyes, deep-brown and sparking with so much spirit and vigor; an optimistic outlook on a future tarnished with bleak borders. I complimented those eyes to her, which is perhaps a dating faux-pas as opposed to complimenting a conscious choice in appearance, but they had the most fixating hold. 

I gave her my number, we exchanged a few back-and-forths about our weeks and she had to travel out for work. I expressed sympathies for her short-notice work assignment while detailing the frustrations of grad school, and was presumably left on read. It stung quite deep but I'm not the type to double text (my own fault maybe) and just assumed she found someone. 

Almost a year later I see her again on the apps and I suddenly felt this extreme sense of panic, I don't know why. Shortness of breath, heart racing, I actually felt a sense of hopelessness and fear and literally cast my phone aside in some Fargoth-try theatric that was authentically felt. I saw other women I had dated prior in the stacks but did not have the same sensation. Whether in good judgement or not I sent a like to her profile after nearly dry heaving for 10 minutes.

I'd normally call it overdramatic Fargoth-try but the feelings were genuine. Quite frankly if I were in front of her I'd get on my knees and hug her in the most pathetic display of desperate affection. To cry out for her sympathy and understanding. For the past four hours this evening since seeing her profile I've found myself unable to rid my thoughts of her and I feel utterly disgusted about it. My eyes have been soaked with tears and have been audibly sighing in agony. I'm blessed to know that she has existed in my life but feel emotionally and spiritually tormented if I may never spend my life with her. I've never felt like such a horrible wreck before but there's no better outlet to state this.

Is it pretentious? A foolish delusion? I would honestly not be surprised if she even browsed this sub. But then I realize how calmed I felt for the first time in most of my life while in her presence. I almost regret moving across the country in pursuit of a new career and purpose.

I’d say she’s got more substance once you get to know her, but she’s initially really shy and awkward. I’ve got less substance, but I’m a wizard at small talk and can go up to strangers confidently. In fact, she’s expressed that she finds it impressive how well I can talk to the barista, cashier, or the person sitting next to us at a coffee shop.

Before we made it official, we dated very casually while dating other people as well. She explained that sometimes, she’d go to the bar with her friend, they’d sit there, and dudes would go up to her and even ask her to dance. She said she’s “picky”, so she’d turn down most advances.

My experience looked like going up to women, introducing myself, chatting with them, sometimes for up to 10-15 mins. But ultimately, while they appreciated my advances, it never really turned into anything.

My question is… if it’s really about personality, then how is it that I require confidence, social skills, and tact, and yet my success rate is still lower than hers, when she doesn’t demonstrate any of those qualities?

Shouldn’t a game where the player is rewarded on looks and abilities seriously penalize her given that she’s quiet and awkward person initially?  In other words, give me her traits, and I’d strike out each and every time…",0,1765957630.0,AskMenAdvice,14,0.5,False

I, 30M, planned a coffee shop business in the middle of this year and to taste test my product, I had my friends come over in my apartment, I mixed my group of friends from work and a few social gatherings I have.

On the night of the taste test event, the friend mix decided it was a good time to have some alcohol, so we indulged. There was some soju, and some alcohol games that asked questions, some deep, some spicy, that is designed to get to know a person better.

Now, in that friend mix, my office friend, 32M, who has been in a relationship had s*x with my roommate, and I caught them (discreetly). So the following week, I had asked him nicely what had happened, and told him I don’t tolerate cheating and I can only be his friend if he confesses to his gf of 7 years.

He asked for forgiveness and for grace and told me if it’s okay for him to tell her once she passes the Bar Exams, since it might distract her and he doesn’t want to be the reason she doesn’t become a lawyer. I agreed and moved on.

Now months have passed and his gf has now become a lawyer, I have reminded him of our agreement and this time he says he doesn’t remember us having that agreement, and parang ayaw na nya umamin, which created some tension between us. 

Now, I understand his situation, being with her for that long, pero kasi sabi ko ginawa mo yun, so dapat harapin nya. Kasi if I were the girl, ayoko pang sa iba pa manggaling. 

Ngayon parang ako pa lumalabas na masama for asking him to confess, because it might ruin their relationship and sabi nila “it’s not my story to tell”. I told them, burden ko rin kasi yun kasi sa bahay ko ginawa and I am staying silent, that means ok ako sa mga ginawa nya (I am really against it).

Chapter 1

Ten years after being cast out by my family, my mate, and my pack, I met my former Alpha mate and brother by adoption in a small town.

After all these years apart, one had become a decorated Alpha warrior, the other a high-ranking Alpha—and I was just running a tiny coffee shop.

The moment our eyes met, both men froze for a long time.

Then Adrian hid the pregnancy test in his hand behind his back, and Mike slipped the jewelry he'd bought for his sister into his pocket.

I lowered my gaze, packed up the cake and coffee, and handed them over politely.

""Here you are, Alphas.""

The overly distant address made both of them falter for a second.

As they pushed open the door to leave, Adrian suddenly turned around and asked,

""You said you'd never bake desserts again for the rest of your life, didn't you?""

I smiled politely. ""Just something foolish I said in anger.""

The sound of children laughing and playing outside drifted in faintly through the glass door, but it couldn't break the stagnation inside the shop.

The two Alphas who'd teamed up to have me cast out from the pack all those years ago still stood at the cash register, refusing to leave.

Adrian clutched the box of macarons and coffee, his throat worked,

""Eden's having bad morning sickness. We're bringing her to stay south of the pack for a while.""

""Your mother… came with us too.""

""Would you like to see her?""

I shook my head as I wiped the counter. ""No need. Give my regards to Luna Juliet.""

Pausing, I added, ""Or don't mention it at all—better to avoid misunderstandings.""

My foster brother Mike's knuckles whitened as he tightened his grip,

""Hazel, all these years we—""

""Hazel!""

A girl with dyed green hair bounced through the door, threw her arms around mine, and shook me, ""I'm starving!""

A genuine smile finally spread across my face as I tapped her nose, ""There's your favorite chocolate chip cookie in the fridge.""

""Noooo,"" Isla whined, ""Hazel, eat with me.""

I glanced helplessly at the two men, my smile fading: ""Alphas, your cake and coffee are ready.""

Adrian's gaze flickered when he heard ""chocolate chip cookie.""

Mike stared blankly at Isla's lively figure, the rest of his words died on his lips.

I took Isla's hand and walked into the back kitchen, the automatic door sliding shut to cut off their view.

When I emerged again, the shop was empty.

Isla mumbled around her fork: ""Hazel, do you know those two Alphas? They were looking at you weird.""

""When they arrived, I saw a whole entourage—warriors and everything.""

""I heard one's a famous Alpha warrior across all packs, and the other's a respected Alpha.""

I kept my head down as I sorted through receipts. ""Here, they're just customers.""

""If I really knew people like that,"" I poked her forehead gently, ""would I be waking up early every day to bake you cakes and cookies?""

Isla giggled, leaning in to whisper in my ear:

""Word is that Alpha warrior's Luna is that other Alpha's sister—they came all the way here for her to rest during her pregnancy. It must be wonderful to be so cherished.""

I nodded calmly, tossing a used piping bag into the trash can.

Of course I knew how much they spoiled Eden.

After all, ten years ago—

One had had me committed to a werewolf psychiatric hospital on our mating ceremony night, branding me a laughingstock, a madwoman.

The other had announced my death to the pack and personally driven me out into exile.

Together, they'd shattered me completely and cast mee into a living hell.

Couldn't focus for more than 1 or 2 hours without the stress of the exam being in a few days.

Tried all kind of tricks and good practices but it wasnt good enough, still max 1 or 2h. Then I started to look up into adhd and everything seemed like it looked like my vital experience. Got a neuropsichologycal evaluation and got diagnosed with adhd. Scheduled a session with a psychiatrist who told me to get a heart checkup and go to a neurologist, and got meds prescribed 

First day I took them I straight up studied for 5 hours without getting a single little distraction, it was like I had a laser in my eyes. Also felt a bit of pressure in the front of the head, and felt very active. Had problems to sleep but its worth it if I can finally do the things I want to do

Now Im on my 5th day of taking it and its not as intense as the first day, but its still very good. I feel pushed to do things and its easy to start tasks and remain doing them. I dont need three coffees a day to feel awake and be able to focus anymore (dont even take one as I read it can be bad, dont need it either). Will get into decaf because I like the flavour of coffee

Im worried about having to stop taking them in the future or something, but thats a future me problem (the big exam is in 6 months)


TL,DR: Adhd meds make my life so much easier

‘People will be told to use pillowcases, coffee filter papers or bed sheets to make water safe for drinking in the event of a long-lasting nationwide power cut.
Householders will also be urged to eat chilled or defrosted food first before tins, cook on camping stoves in their back gardens, and prioritise family members for nutrition, public health advice from the UK’s chief medical officers says.
The Government has for the first time published the scripts that would be read out by Professor Chris Whitty and his fellow medical officers on Radio 2 and Radio 4 in the event of a national blackout.’

Very interesting article showing that plans are being put in place, but I can’t help think that rather than trickling this information out like this, we would be in a better place as a country if this was fully announced in advance so more people are ready. Maybe that’s coming. I hope so. Doesn’t seem ideal that the first most people might hear about this is an emergency broadcast. 

Good time to check that you’re not going to be relying on pillowcases! I have drained one of my rainwater barrels so it’s freshly refilled. I have 3 that are not as easy to drain but that will be good for grey water. I’m getting some extra aqua tabs to give to my family and I’ll try to make sure they all have the basics. 

Fwiw, inews has been doing a great series on military readiness and grey zone warfare, as well as cyber security etc. I have a subscription but some of it isn’t paywalled. Good that it’s in a national newspaper but who buys newspapers anymore? People aren’t ready.

better to reserve tickets now, or wait until trip gets closer? does an 11:30am or 12pm appt slot sound reasonable? as for our luggage, better to leave in the car or rent out a locker from the lagoon? 

we feel solid about the first 3-4 days, but needing some feedback for the rest of it.. itinerary so far: 

Day 1:
- Land, pickup car rental 
- Sky Lagoon
- check in + explore Reykjavík
- possibly grocery shop 
- dinner 
📍Reykjavík

Day 2:
- Breakfast, then drive out
- Golden circle (Þingvellir, oxararfoss, Brúarfoss, strokker Geysir, kerid crater - maybe)
- lunch at Friðheimar
- make dinner at airbnb
📍Hella

Day 3:
- Seljalandafoss
    - Gljufrabi
- Skogafoss
- Solheimajokull glacier hike
- Dyrholaey - puffins cliff
- Reynisfjara black sand beach
- Lunch and/or Dinner at black crust pizza or soup company
📍 Vik

Day 4:
- Breakfast/coffee at Skool Beans
- Katla ice cave
- Fjadrargljufur canyon (overlook)
- Svartifoss
- Skaftafell 
- Mulagljufur canyon (3.5mi hike)
📍 Hotel Jokulsarlon

Day 5: 
- Diamond beach
- Jokulsarlon glacier lagoon
- Vatnajokull national park
- Stokksnes, Vestrahorn
📍Hofn or back to Vik + Reykjavik 

From this point, we’re not sure if we can swing the entire ring road so we can make Stuðlagil Canyon, or if we should just spread the south coast activities out a little more and spend some time in Snæfellsnes peninsula. Definitely learning towards checking out Snæfellsnes but just don’t know how to split up the trip back..

Day 6: (???)

Day 7: (???)

Day 8: (???) 
📍Reykjavík (for easy access flying out next day)

Day 9:
- breakfast
- explore city, then checkout 
- return rental car
- be at airport by 2:20pm
- depart 4:50pm


Some things to keep in mind/general questions we had: 
- We would be open to doing 2 nights in Vik and/or 2 nights at Hotel Jokulsarlon if that makes things any easier
- Since we are planning to splurge on at leastone night at Hotel Jokulsarlon, we definitely would want to take advantage of the entire allotted stay time for a relaxed day (afternoon check-in to morning check-out). Open to making changes to the current itinerary to make that happen
- Would it even worth driving east enough to Hofn if we turn around at that point?
- In between the glacier hike we would want to do (Solheimajokull vs. Katla ice cave vs. Skaftafell, vs. Vatnajokull - not doing all)
- Any excursions we are missing that you enjoyed in Iceland? Also contemplating horseback riding

**Dear Sally,**

The cat appears on a Tuesday, which feels intentional, though I know it isn’t. Tuesdays are already compromised days—too far from the mercy of Monday, nowhere near the promise of Friday. I find it sitting on the stoop when I come home from work, pressed into the corner where the railing meets the brick. Gray, but not the fancy kind of gray that rich people call blue. More like dust. One ear is nicked, and its eyes are sort of amusingly unimpressed by my purple loafers, which seem to be the only thing in its field of vision right now.

I step over it at first. This isn’t cruelty so much as muscle memory. I don’t make a habit of intervening in things that seem determined to exist without me. I fish my keys out of my bag—ha, *fish*. Those are never determined to exist without me, considering how many have died on my watch after I miss a feeding or two. Non-resilient little things, bettas. I used to think the Petco on Broadway and 87th sells them sick on purpose, passes them off to us helpless idiots desperate for some approximation of a pet in our NYC apartments. *Get a fish*, we all think. When what we really want is a dog.

If you want a dog, move to Montana. Why else do you think Montana exists, if not to accommodate hundreds of dogs? Maybe hundreds of babies, too. Populate the place. It’s dying for it. Maybe then it would have more than two districts. I hope all the babies in Montana grow up wildly politically diverse and mix something up in there. Cause some drama.

Anyway, the keys. I obviously drop them, curse, bend to pick them up. Because of course every time you pick up keys they fall out of your hand the first time. There’s some power in keys that makes you briefly transparent the moment you touch them. I’m not sure if you knew that, but now you do, so you’re welcome.

When I straighten, the cat hasn’t moved. It watches me with the same flat patience I reserve for customers at the local pizzeria where I work. I know what you’re thinking—this cool, awesome, interesting person who knows about Montana and fish and cats and keys works at a pizzeria. What talent, wasted. It’s not wasted, though. I get free pizza and rice balls, which are especially my favorite, and I can performatively write things on napkins when people are watching, and—

Oh. Wait. Me and the cat. Hold on.

“Don’t start,” I tell it, which is unfair. It hasn’t said anything. And by *hasn’t said anything* I mean it hasn’t meowed, because obviously a cat can’t talk. What a ridiculous ideology you have there. I’m not crazy, by the way. I like to call myself eclectic, but if I’m being totally, truthfully honest, I’m not even quite sure I know what that means.

Anyway, leaving that un-meowing, non-talking cat outside—upstairs, however, I pour myself a drink. Vodka, warm from the cabinet, a lazy squeeze of lime I find fossilizing in the crisper. I drink it standing at the counter, then another, because the first one only sharpens the edges of the day without doing the courtesy of dulling them. That *is* a fun line. I’m keeping it.

Somewhere between the second and third, I realize I’m thinking about the cat. This irritates me. I don’t like when things linger. Unless it’s that one Cranberries song. I like that one. Very *into* deep, you know—*I’m such a fool for you*. You know it.

Anyway, I go back downstairs with a slice of deli turkey folded in half like an offering. The cat sniffs it, unimpressed, then eats it anyway. This genuinely irritates me, as if that stupid gray-not-blue cat has anything better to sink its dull little fangs into. It chews carefully.

“Fine,” I say. “One night.” I want to be like those people in movies who talk to animals and genuinely believe the animal understands them, which is so farcical when I think about it, Sally, but I don’t care. I really do say it to the cat. And I pretend it understands me.

This is how it starts. Not with intention. With fatigue. And some vodka glasses and deli meat.

Inside, the cat walks the perimeter of the apartment like an inspector. It sniffs the baseboards, the legs of the dining table, the cabinet with the opera records. It jumps onto the couch without asking, circles twice, and settles directly on the spot where I usually sit. Territoriality recognizes territoriality. I have to give him—or her—or they—or it—some respect. I haven’t checked. There’s something beautiful in that kind of careless confidence. Or maybe not beautiful. I don’t know what to call it, and I don’t want to name it.

I name it nothing. Naming things creates expectations. I call it Cat when I need to address it, which I rarely do. Very *Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany’s*. I also had a friend in high school who called his cats Cat 1 and Cat 2, which I find deeply wrong and vaguely disrespectful—if you actually love the things. That isn’t the case here, you see.

Anyway, it sleeps all day and comes alive around midnight, when I am also most myself. Sometimes it sits across from me while I drink, its tail wrapped neatly around its paws, watching me with a look that suggests it knows exactly what I’m doing and has no plans to intervene. See, Sally, I don’t even know why I write that. It can’t intervene even if it wants to. It doesn’t know what alcohol is.

The first time I give it alcohol is an accident, technically. I knock over my glass, and a thin spill fans across the coffee table. The cat hops up immediately, curious, and before I can stop it, laps at the edge of the puddle. It makes a face—violent, offended—but then goes back for more.

“Well,” I say. “That’s on you.”

After that, it becomes a habit. Not every night. I’m not a monster. Sometimes just a fingertip dipped into the glass, offered like communion. The cat grows looser, stranger. It bats at invisible things. Once, it stares at the wall for so long I consider apologizing to it for whatever it’s seeing. Eventually it collapses into sleep, a heavy, trusting weight against my thigh. I tell myself this means something.

My neighbor, Sarah—the one I was telling you about—hates the cat on sight.

“That thing is judging me,” she says, hovering in the doorway like she expects it to lunge. “And it smells like a bar.”

“It has hobbies,” I tell her.

She crouches, extends a manicured finger. The cat sniffs it, then turns its head away with deliberate slowness.

“Rude,” she says.

We drink. The cat watches. At some point, Sarah notices the bottle cap on the table, the one I’ve been using to fill with vodka for the cat.

“Are you—” She stops herself. Reconsiders. “You know what? Never mind. I don’t want to know.”

The cat climbs into her lap anyway, betraying me. Sarah stiffens, then relaxes, stroking its back with careful, performative gentleness.

“It likes me,” she says.

“It likes warmth,” I correct. I’m laughing as I say this, Sally, because I keep thinking about that warm feeling you get after you drink, and how maybe the cat feels that too, and maybe we have that in common. I don’t know. That warm feeling together. I’m drunk right now, Sally. Can you tell.

After she leaves, the apartment feels larger, hollowed out. The cat sits in the middle of the living room like a punctuation mark. I like that phrase—*punctuation mark*. It really paints a clear visual, doesn’t it. Ugh. Lucky you, getting letters like this.

Anyway, I pour another drink and sit on the floor across from it. We regard each other. I lower my finger into the glass, hold it out. The cat sniffs, hesitates, then licks. Its eyes half-close.

“Cheers,” I say, which makes me laugh.

That night, I dream I’m back at the pizzeria—Luigi’s. I’m not sure if I told you the name—and in the dream I’m counting ceiling tiles, except the tiles are all the same cat’s face, replicated endlessly, blinking in unison. I wake up with a headache.

(38 male, 36female (8 year relationship going toxic)","TL:DR my partner had been messaging her ex boyfriend through social media right under my nose for 8 years of our relationship and I found out 4 years ago, haven’t felt the same since and then recently we blew up because another woman who is a therapist explained to me that this was wrong in every way and told me I deserved better and she had developed feelings for me. 

The long story. So in 2017 I met the girl of my dreams, adventure, not vegan, funny and pretty. We had both come out of dreadful short term relationships and met dating apps and quickly decided we were meant to be. We moved in together shortly afterwards and nothing seemed “wrong”.

We both spoke about our past relationships time to time as I’d lived in Australia for years and had to return to England and cancel my spouse visa as my selfish ex had decided the guys at her local gym were physically attractive, but then once I’d left for the uk after an horrible event of finding messages and pictures on her phone, she protested she missed our connection and my personality and other traits. 

My partner had come out of two breakups where she was the ‘dumpee’. The first in 2015 where her ex had become distant where he began messaging people on grinder and other apps despite apparently being heterosexual, and her latest in 2017 where she was eventually locked out of the house and another woman moved in.  (Red flag stuff for both of us, but who am I to judge)

We lived in a tiny damp cottage for a few years while I saved money for a deposit and we bought a house. Disappointed that at the time she was earning good money, she didn’t have a great deal to put towards and borrowed money off her family. 

Not long after us having the keys and making our first real home, I brought us coffee in bed and she was on her phone, I looked over her shoulder and she was frantically typing and deleting messages. It was from her ex ex? (The apparently not gay one). My reaction was “please can you stop that?, may I see the conversation?” Bearing in mind I’ve been cheated on before with new men. Not an old flame. There were pages and pages of paragraphs that I didn’t even read that kept scrolling backwards. I’d seen enough and my neck muscles started to tense and I was going dizzy. She huffed at me and said “fine, whatever” and didn’t seem phased at all that she was casually talking to him like he was a close friend? Not once had she mentioned to me that she was regularly messaging each other. We never spoke about it again for 4 years FOUR YEARS. Since that day we’ve done loads together, travelled, worked, lived but always at the back of my mind I’d had these lingering thoughts about her messaging and part of my heart died inside. 

In 2025 I began feeling depressed from things getting me down such as bullying at work and from general anxiety from life in general. Because of this I shifted my focus of my hobbies into history, ghost stories, metal detecting and generally what you would call nerdy stuff. I bought a camper van and converted it out on my driveway and we’ve been touring Wales and Scotland and Lake District nearly every other month when I can squeeze time in with work. 

Through one of my Facebook groups I began talking to a local girl who was also studying ancient wells and Roman history around where I live and after a few conversations and exchanging intelligence on the topic she said she wanted to come meet me and my partner to visit some of the sites for her history blog and YouTube channel (no. Seriously!) my girlfriend absolutely erupted and said things like “I don’t trust this f***ing bi***” etc and began hugging and puffing saying do whatever you need to do, whatever she’s your new friend. 

So eventually I told her that my partner was incredibly jealous and she agreed maybe it would be unfair and I said we should remain friends at a professional level. She agreed and we didn’t talk for a while. She messaged me a while later and asked if my partner of 8 years didn’t trust me to talk to someone else as I had no friends outside of our relationship, she said it was odd as she’s a trained therapist and running her own business and explained to me that I must know that something isn’t right and I’m not telling her the full story. Eventually I cracked and told her that we’d had a bad time but getting over it, at which point she told me that my partner is continuing to message the ex and that I’m being taken for a ride. She said confront her and just be honest with each other. 

I asked my partner if she actually loved me one day and she burst into tears and said “guess you’re dumping me like everyone else does, I’m not good enough”.. we slept in seperate beds for a while and I fell into dark depression. I asked about the ex and it turned out that she was indeed still messaging him “once in a blue moon”, but it transpired she’d been liking his pictures and posts on social media and sending money to his gofundme charity and such all the way since 2016! She said there was nothing there, and it didn’t mean anything. When I asked her if she had feelings or unfinished business with him, she exploded in rage at me and started shouting and getting angry. At this point I don’t even know who she is anymore. 

In between all this I told the history nerd friend and she laughed and said you’re an idiot (politely) and said spare yourself the pain and sell your house and meet someone who actually wouldn’t do this to you, and in her words she said from day one she had developed feelings for me.  I had a massive panic attack not long after because my brain and my heart began an intense fight.

The other woman (36 also) in this she lives about 10 minutes away and came to visit me whilst metal detecting and she was just a gentle soul, quiet, polite but still a bit of a Tom boy. She brought me a copy of a paperback book to read about a fictional roman character called “frontier wolf”. It was all a bit much and I’ve never had another woman come onto me and I said I’m still in a relationship and we are working it out. She kept her distance but began giving me advice on my partner from a woman’s and therapists perspective assuring me that I will fall into a nervous breakdown. 

Long story shorter, after talking with her for a while for advice she said there was nothing more she could do and she said what she was offering, we went no contact and we’ve not spoken since. My partner assured me that she is no longer talking to her ex or family and has FINALLY blocked him and his off all social media and conveniently deleted all messages. At one point my partners sister called me and said I needed to go to therapy if I didn’t agree that it was okay for her to remain friends with ex and talk to him. I said if this was the other way around I don’t think we’d be having this conversation.

The other woman agreed to leave me and my partner alone to work out our apparently obvious mistakes. Sadly afterwards she found out where I lived and for a short while wouldn’t leave me alone as it felt like she wanted us to break up for good. 

I’ve been off work for  while with stress as this was the icing on the cake. There’s good and bad news, me and the partner are still together! However the bad news is we’ve both hurt each other and it’s hard moving forwards. But she is still here and we carry on together. Part of me still feels the pain that she told me she considered my feelings when she was messaging the ex but did it anyway. Part of me knows despite her lack of respect and empathy, I’ve lead myself a stray to confide in someone else. 

For the record. No, me and other woman never kissed, touched, flirted anything like that. It was a weird dynamic a bit like “good will hunting” and she was Robin Williams haha. One time I literally sat on a park bench and told her my life like a therapist and she just gave me advice. I’ve never experienced anything like it in my life.

The real punchline is this, is when we met in real life, I frowned and said “I know who you are, this is really odd but I feel like you’re like family or something, this is awks!” We joked about it. Transpired that in a conversation her mother was from the same village as my father and from what I can tell, her mother was born out of wedlock to my father’s second cousin / uncle. If that was the case we would indeed have shared the same great great grandfather. I’m not down with that, this isn’t the Deep South! (Vom) she was quite upset by this. This reinforced my argument that we should remain friends.

Moving forwards I’m seeing a therapist now and she’s working on my self esteem and acceptance issues. My partner refused to go to couples therapy. We both just want to forget about this, but occasional she still gaslights me into saying things that are to do with “her” or whatever I don’t enjoy it, I’ve never mentioned her ex since dday.

I don’t want to see her phone nor have I ever looked because part of me doesn’t want to know if she is still in contact with him.

Yeah, same. Everyone talks about charisma like it’s some magical aura you either have or don’t, but flirting is actually way more science-based than you think. I went full nerd-mode on this. Dug through psychology journals, behavioral science books, research interviews, and even AI-generated behavioral pattern studies.

And here’s the deal: most flirting advice out there is complete trash. TikTok coaches screaming about “alpha male energy” or “negging” are recycling outdated pickup artist tactics that don’t work on emotionally intelligent people. Especially not the kind of woman you’re trying to build actual chemistry with.

If you actually want results, you need to understand this: the most powerful flirting technique is not a line, it’s a behavior (mimicry + playfulness + high emotional attunement). Let me break it down below, with the juicy insight and receipts.

1. Mirror their vibe but in a subtle way.  
Behavioral mimicry is a major social signal. Studies from the Social Cognition Lab at NYU show that people are more likely to feel attraction when others subtly mirror their gestures, tone, or expressions. This isn’t about copying. It’s about tuning into their pace and style. If they lean in, you lean in slightly. If they’re animated, you dial your energy up a bit. This creates subconscious alignment that our brains read as “safety” and “chemistry.”

2. Teasing > complimenting.  
Don’t lead with ""You’re so pretty"" , that's the baseline. Instead, lightly tease or challenge in a playful way. Research from Dr. Jeffrey Hall at University of Kansas found that humor, banter, and inside jokes are more predictive of successful romantic progression than surface compliments. Something like “You’re probably the kind of person who alphabetizes their spice rack” hits way harder than “nice smile.” Why? It creates a micro-story between you two.

3. Signal availability without being needy.  
Flirting that works long term involves showing interest while maintaining self-respect. Harvard studies on evolutionary psychology show that people (especially women) are more attracted to potential partners who are selective but still open to them. So yeah, eye contact, engaged listening, playful responses (all yes). But also show you have standards. People subconsciously value those who value themselves.

4. Ask questions that trigger emotion, not logic.  
If you’re stuck in “what do you do for work” mode, you’ve already lost. According to a 2018 Hinge study, dates that involved “emotion-evoking” topics resulted in 34% more interest post-date. Swap “what do you do” for “what’s something you’re lowkey obsessed with right now?” or “what would you do if money didn’t matter?” It gets people talking from their heart, not their LinkedIn.

5. Break the ‘eye contact tension’ pattern.  
Eye contact is massive. But instead of non-stop staring, try this micro trick: lock eyes for 1-2 seconds, glance away (ideally down, not up as it signals sincerity), smile, then go back. It’s an “approach-avoid-approach” pattern. A study published in the Journal of Research in Personality found this exact rhythm to notably increase perceived flirtatiousness without triggering awkwardness.

6. Reframe rejection as data, not ego death.  
This one’s less sexy but crucial. According to research from Dr. Vanessa Bohns at Cornell, people drastically underestimate how positively others perceive them. So if you think it went poorly, chances are your read was off. If rejection happens, interpret it as misalignment, not a “you” problem. You literally can’t flirt well if you’re scared of embarrassment. Play the odds, not your fears.

7. Use “shared attention” environments to your advantage.  
One of the best predictors of successful flirting? Being in a context where attention is split. Think: gallery opening, bookstore, coffee shop, nature walks, etc. According to behavioral data from sociologist Dr. Monica Moore, environments where people observe things together (without pressure) lower threat responses and spark more natural interactions. It gives you conversation material that’s not you trying too hard.

8. Text with warmth, not ‘coolness’.  
The “act uninterested” game is old. Cornell research on intimacy acceleration shows that high-warm, low-pressure texts foster deeper connections. Think simple but emotionally tuned texts like “Hey, I’ve been thinking about what you said the other night, that was such an interesting take.” Be curious, not clingy.

9. Learn from relationship-savvy content not red-pill nonsense.  
Here’s where I get my best info to stay sharp without turning into a walking psychology textbook:

1. The book “Captivate” by Vanessa Van Edwards  
Insanely good book backed by behavioral science. NYT bestseller. Vanessa is a human behavior investigator who synthesizes psychology data into bite-sized social hacks. After reading this I stopped guessing what people wanted and knew how to build real rapport. Best book I’ve read on social connection and influence.

2. “Models” by Mark Manson  
Ignore the hype around his other books, this is his actual masterpiece. Manson calls out BS “pick-up” culture and explains how genuine vulnerability, self-awareness, and emotional intelligence are 100x more attractive than tactics. This book made me rethink how I approached confidence entirely.

3. App: Cue by Humane  
Cue is a social emotional intelligence coach that uses AI to help you navigate flirting, dating, conversations, and even workplace charisma. It analyzes how you communicate and gives live feedback. Super underrated if you want to build magnetic presence.

4. App: BeFreed  
An AI-powered learning app which creates personalized podcasts and adaptive learning plans based on your goals. You just type in what you want to improve like flirting, emotional attunement, or charisma and it pulls from top-tier books, research, and expert talks to build a custom audio journey. You can even personalize the voice and length of each session. Essential tool for lifelong learners who want to grow without doomscrolling.

5. App: Rizz  
Yes, the name is ridiculous. But hear me out. This app uses AI to simulate conversations and social scenarios involving flirting, dating, and verbal games. Great for practice. Helps you with flow, context-switching, and not freezing when things escalate.

6. Podcast: “The Science of People”  
Hosted by Vanessa Van Edwards, this podcast dives into nonverbal cues, flirting strategies, and charisma building. It’s smart but digestible. Every episode gives practical takeaways you can try that same day.

7. Youtube: Charisma on Command  
You’ve probably seen their videos. But their breakdowns of charisma in real-world and media examples (like analyzing celebrities) are weirdly effective. Helps you learn what’s attractive behaviorally, not what feels “logical.”

8. Study: “Flirting Styles and Romantic Initiation: Validation and Reliability of Hall’s 5 Flirting Styles”  
This is the OG research that provides a framework for the different types of flirters like physical, playful, sincere, polite, and traditional. Knowing your natural style helps you lean into what already works for you.

The best flirting doesn’t feel like flirting. It feels like a connection. If you master mirroring, warmth, playfulness, and confidence in being *genuinely* interested, you're already ahead of almost everyone.

The immersive pop-up on Melrose Avenue featured a vintage RL67 shop, artisan workshops, Ralph’s Coffee, a charitable Christmas tree farm, and live performances.

This appearance also landed right in the middle of Hudson’s press tour for *Song Sung Blue*, her upcoming holiday release with Hugh Jackman.

For the past few weeks, I’ve had this really nice and fun, a bit intense flirt going on with the seller (in his 30’s, I believe) at the little store in my neighborhood.

It started out with some mutual looks and smiles, and continued to having some small talk about the store, from there on he also asked me some questions about myself (what’s my name, when did I move to the neighborhood, where I’m from), and then progressed to him asking me to have coffee with him, and gave me his number.

After I texted him hi, he followed up by saying that he really likes me vibe, wants to get to know me, but wanted to give me a heads up that he is currently dating someone and is looking for friendship vibes and if it’s okay by me.

That message confused me on so many levels. I am struggling to make sense of this situation, would appreciate your help understanding what was up.

I started to wonder, have I imagined this flirtatious vibe all along? Was it one sided?

It felt also like a compliment, since he is already seeing someone else, but was so compelled by me that he had to get my number and get to know me one on one, but it also felt a rejection, and like someone leading me on, flirting with me and then when it gets real - FRIENZONING me!

I told him that in that case I am not interested, I just didn’t like this plot twist, and it also feels unfair towards his other date.

1poq4j4,https://i.redd.it/vf96y9q1lp7g1.jpeg,"ONE MAN Crews are a problem – Devs, please LISTEN","Guys, I'm wasting my time again.

30 minutes total: writing text, editing images, double-checking everything, grabbing a coffee, posting it.

  
**One-man crews.**

  
People grab a BTR, LAV25, BRDM, or a helicopter, rush to the nearest point, and get hunted down by the next bot or player. Boom. Vehicle gone. This has been happening since launch in May 2022, and it just never stops.

It always reopens old wounds – having to see and experience this over and over again in matches. **Today - 3 Hours before -**  I asked if I could be the gunner. He insulted me and said that it was his vehicle and he wanted to play alone. OK! 500 meters further on – boom – and the vehicle was on fire. 

Man. Is that the point of having these vehicles in the game!?

  
I mainly run logistics, and it’s incredibly frustrating to see roads littered with wrecked vehicles because people keep playing like solo heroes.

It always goes like this:

1. “Awesome, this is mine.”
2. Some guy: “Hey, there’s a BTR.”
3. Boom.
4. “What a stupid game.” *Dislike.*

I have **never** seen a match where people actually work together — APCs with infantry, advancing and covering each other. And honestly, I’ve lost hope that I ever will in this game !!

  
I’m asking for **one simple thing**:

  
Limit the spawning of high-cost vehicles in **HQ Conflict Mode** (the so-called Hardcore Reforger Vanilla mode). At least let serious players avoid this constant waste there. This applies to helicopters, APCs — basically anything expensive.

You **can’t** just spawn a BTR piece by piece because you want it all to yourself. These vehicles are supply points. They belong to the team. Someone has to move supplies — and it’s almost never the one-man crews.

Why is this still a thing?  
This needs to stop.

  
What do I hope for?  
That at some point, somewhere in the very back of the devs’ minds, it clicks that this behavior is harmful to everyone.

I really hope I live long enough to see that.

**PS:** No, I don’t play on modded servers. I just want to enjoy vanilla. I want this waste — and borderline sabotage — to end. 

  
And it doesn't matter which server. People are using the game as it is now. And as long as the game allows this kind of behavior, it will be exploited. Yes, they are exploiting it.

  
You guys always come up with ideas, so here’s one:

  
Limit vehicles per player per match. Two BTRs per person, and that’s it — after that, walk. People wouldn’t throw them away like used tissues anymore. 



**They’d repair them, protect them, and actually value them instead of solo-driving into death and burning 1500 points.**



Maybe then we’ll finally see people choosing to work together — not because they’re nice, but because the game forces them to.



Because only then does a vehicle actually have **VALUE**.



Please start respecting our time. I'm tired of driving around delivering supplies – especially when I see this over and over again. I simply don't have the desire or enjoyment anymore.

I started on November 24th at 107kg. 
Today im at 96.85kg. Im 36f, 1m72.
That was my first goal. 
Second goal is 88.5kg so i won't be in the obesity bmi. 

It started first with an involuntarily 3 days waterfast on November 24th, cause I was too nervous, anxious, afraid..
my relationship was about to end. And then it ended
 (wasnt only my fault, but he refused to admit it and im the vilain. Blocked me everywhere. Even his mom talked to me on the phone and said mean and hurtful things. Anyway)

 It was ugly and yeah I looked at myself and I was miserable in all aspects.
I've become someone i never thought I would be. Mentally. Physically. Couldn't take care of my appearance, I was always sick. Always tired. ect... 
I saw a psychologist. To help me with my mental state.

I've lost weight, December 4th, I was at 102.2. 
I also did omad keto. Sometimes only carnivore. 
And then did waterfast. I wanted to do 5 days minimum but I couldn't, so I stopped at 3 days. I took electrolytes too late i think.
Refeedind slowly. And omad keto/carnivore. I just love red meat. 
I dont count calories. I just stop when im not hungry anymore. Maybe I should. 
But its a big beautiful plate. With olive oil. Mayonnaise and tuna. I love it. 2 to 4 fried eggs with cheese sometimes. 2 Grilled salmon or sashimi. Spinach, brocolis. 2 Red meat. Avocado and pecans. I kinda mix everything. Not all at once. But that's what I have. Its sustainable and im full.
Also im cheating a little cause sometimes in the morning, when i know i will have a loooong day and i dont want to, I have coffee with 100ml of milk. I cant resist it. 
But Its working that way!

I'm not hungry anymore like I used to. 
I dont crave diet coke, i used to drink 1L a day. 
Im not tempted anymore. I used to eat a whole pizza (for 1) and could eat another one and finish with a ben&jerry pb ice cream. It was crazy. But it was never in front of him or other people. 

For medical reasons, I cant do 3 days waterfast this week, I just did 28h fast. But I'll be back on omad keto. Until next week for a 3 days fast minimum. Then omad keto ect. 

I have a stationary bike. I do 30min to 1h a day. I cant do weight lifting because of medical reasons. But I should be able to start in 2 weeks. 

The only thing is that im bored. I try to keep myself busy. But im bored and lonely. And my mind cant stop showing me all the wrong things he did. But also mine. How he triggered all my trauma (low self esteem, ect...) that I didn't even thought were here, and made me act like i did towards him. For that im kinda grateful for the breakup. I felt less weight on my shoulders. And It gives me the opportunity to heal myself with a specialist. 
Even if im bored and lonely, I know im at peace. When you feel like your body isn't under stress 24h/24, 7d/7. It feels empty, light. Its a weird feeling. Not used to it. 

So that's it. 
Never give up on yourself anymore. No matter what. 
Its never too late. Prioritise your health and well being. 
Make small goals. Weight loss. Mental health ect. And never give up.",8,1765954991.0,omad,1,1.0,False

(38 male, 36female (8 year relationship going toxic)","TL:DR my partner had been messaging her ex boyfriend through social media right under my nose for 8 years of our relationship and I found out 4 years ago, haven’t felt the same since and then recently we blew up because another woman who is a therapist explained to me that this was wrong in every way and told me I deserved better and she had developed feelings for me. 

The long story. So in 2017 I met the girl of my dreams, adventure, not vegan, funny and pretty. We had both come out of dreadful short term relationships and met dating apps and quickly decided we were meant to be. We moved in together shortly afterwards and nothing seemed “wrong”.

We both spoke about our past relationships time to time as I’d lived in Australia for years and had to return to England and cancel my spouse visa as my selfish ex had decided the guys at her local gym were physically attractive, but then once I’d left for the uk after an horrible event of finding messages and pictures on her phone, she protested she missed our connection and my personality and other traits. 

My partner had come out of two breakups where she was the ‘dumpee’. The first in 2015 where her ex had become distant where he began messaging people on grinder and other apps despite apparently being heterosexual, and her latest in 2017 where she was eventually locked out of the house and another woman moved in.  (Red flag stuff for both of us, but who am I to judge)

We lived in a tiny damp cottage for a few years while I saved money for a deposit and we bought a house. Disappointed that at the time she was earning good money, she didn’t have a great deal to put towards and borrowed money off her family. 

Not long after us having the keys and making our first real home, I brought us coffee in bed and she was on her phone, I looked over her shoulder and she was frantically typing and deleting messages. It was from her ex ex? (The apparently not gay one). My reaction was “please can you stop that?, may I see the conversation?” Bearing in mind I’ve been cheated on before with new men. Not an old flame. There were pages and pages of paragraphs that I didn’t even read that kept scrolling backwards. I’d seen enough and my neck muscles started to tense and I was going dizzy. She huffed at me and said “fine, whatever” and didn’t seem phased at all that she was casually talking to him like he was a close friend? Not once had she mentioned to me that she was regularly messaging each other. We never spoke about it again for 4 years FOUR YEARS. Since that day we’ve done loads together, travelled, worked, lived but always at the back of my mind I’d had these lingering thoughts about her messaging and part of my heart died inside. 

In 2025 I began feeling depressed from things getting me down such as bullying at work and from general anxiety from life in general. Because of this I shifted my focus of my hobbies into history, ghost stories, metal detecting and generally what you would call nerdy stuff. I bought a camper van and converted it out on my driveway and we’ve been touring Wales and Scotland and Lake District nearly every other month when I can squeeze time in with work. 

Through one of my Facebook groups I began talking to a local girl who was also studying ancient wells and Roman history around where I live and after a few conversations and exchanging intelligence on the topic she said she wanted to come meet me and my partner to visit some of the sites for her history blog and YouTube channel (no. Seriously!) my girlfriend absolutely erupted and said things like “I don’t trust this f***ing bi***” etc and began hugging and puffing saying do whatever you need to do, whatever she’s your new friend. 

So eventually I told her that my partner was incredibly jealous and she agreed maybe it would be unfair and I said we should remain friends at a professional level. She agreed and we didn’t talk for a while. She messaged me a while later and asked if my partner of 8 years didn’t trust me to talk to someone else as I had no friends outside of our relationship, she said it was odd as she’s a trained therapist and running her own business and explained to me that I must know that something isn’t right and I’m not telling her the full story. Eventually I cracked and told her that we’d had a bad time but getting over it, at which point she told me that my partner is continuing to message the ex and that I’m being taken for a ride. She said confront her and just be honest with each other. 

I asked my partner if she actually loved me one day and she burst into tears and said “guess you’re dumping me like everyone else does, I’m not good enough”.. we slept in seperate beds for a while and I fell into dark depression. I asked about the ex and it turned out that she was indeed still messaging him “once in a blue moon”, but it transpired she’d been liking his pictures and posts on social media and sending money to his gofundme charity and such all the way since 2016! She said there was nothing there, and it didn’t mean anything. When I asked her if she had feelings or unfinished business with him, she exploded in rage at me and started shouting and getting angry. At this point I don’t even know who she is anymore. 

In between all this I told the history nerd friend and she laughed and said you’re an idiot (politely) and said spare yourself the pain and sell your house and meet someone who actually wouldn’t do this to you, and in her words she said from day one she had developed feelings for me.  I had a massive panic attack not long after because my brain and my heart began an intense fight.

The other woman (36 also) in this she lives about 10 minutes away and came to visit me whilst metal detecting and she was just a gentle soul, quiet, polite but still a bit of a Tom boy. She brought me a copy of a paperback book to read about a fictional roman character called “frontier wolf”. It was all a bit much and I’ve never had another woman come onto me and I said I’m still in a relationship and we are working it out. She kept her distance but began giving me advice on my partner from a woman’s and therapists perspective assuring me that I will fall into a nervous breakdown. 

Long story shorter, after talking with her for a while for advice she said there was nothing more she could do and she said what she was offering, we went no contact and we’ve not spoken since. My partner assured me that she is no longer talking to her ex or family and has FINALLY blocked him and his off all social media and conveniently deleted all messages. At one point my partners sister called me and said I needed to go to therapy if I didn’t agree that it was okay for her to remain friends with ex and talk to him. I said if this was the other way around I don’t think we’d be having this conversation.

The other woman agreed to leave me and my partner alone to work out our apparently obvious mistakes. Sadly afterwards she found out where I lived and for a short while wouldn’t leave me alone as it felt like she wanted us to break up for good. 

I’ve been off work for  while with stress as this was the icing on the cake. There’s good and bad news, me and the partner are still together! However the bad news is we’ve both hurt each other and it’s hard moving forwards. But she is still here and we carry on together. Part of me still feels the pain that she told me she considered my feelings when she was messaging the ex but did it anyway. Part of me knows despite her lack of respect and empathy, I’ve lead myself a stray to confide in someone else. 

For the record. No, me and other woman never kissed, touched, flirted anything like that. It was a weird dynamic a bit like “good will hunting” and she was Robin Williams haha. One time I literally sat on a park bench and told her my life like a therapist and she just gave me advice. I’ve never experienced anything like it in my life.

The real punchline is this, is when we met in real life, I frowned and said “I know who you are, this is really odd but I feel like you’re like family or something, this is awks!” We joked about it. Transpired that in a conversation her mother was from the same village as my father and from what I can tell, her mother was born out of wedlock to my father’s second cousin / uncle. If that was the case we would indeed have shared the same great great grandfather. I’m not down with that, this isn’t the Deep South! (Vom) she was quite upset by this. This reinforced my argument that we should remain friends.

Moving forwards I’m seeing a therapist now and she’s working on my self esteem and acceptance issues. My partner refused to go to couples therapy. We both just want to forget about this, but occasional she still gaslights me into saying things that are to do with “her” or whatever I don’t enjoy it, I’ve never mentioned her ex since dday.

I don’t want to see her phone nor have I ever looked because part of me doesn’t want to know if she is still in contact with him.

When she was getting ready to leave for work and Penny as she often does just barges in half dressed to steal coffee, Stephanie takes umbrage with this. For starters, she's in her boyfriend's apartment(where she began moving his stuff in favor of hers). He and Sheldon's dynamic with Penny can be her concern but she has no say in it as long as Leonard's relationship with Penny is platonic. That said, Stephanie was claiming ownership where she has none. Leonard not mentioning Penny(we'll dispense with the fact that there's no way Penny would not have run into Stephanie at some point), shouldn't matter. Leonard isn't in a relationship with Penny. Does he have to disclose every tenant in the building? But to me this was a red flag moment that Stephanie is clingy which we find out later.

I'm pretty left leaning, LGBTQ+ friendly, and 420 friendly as well. I drink socially like when I'm out at nice restaurant or as a treat, rarely a drinker at home. I do love my coffee and edibles though!

I would describe myself as short, I have reddish/brown curly hair, and I wear glasses. I love all things pink, it pretty much takes up my entire wardrobe but I love emo/metal music, taxidermy, and occult things!

Anyways, if any of this seems like your vibe, send me a message!

1popt8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1popt8l/sobrang_umay_na_sa_sisterinlaw_na_nagbabakasyon/,"Sobrang umay na sa sister-in-law na ""nagbabakasyon"" samin","Si SIL ay 24 y/o who recently just passed the nursing boards. But she graduated last year pa yata. Ang dami lang nangyari kaya nalate na siya magtake ng exam. Ever since she graduated, palagi na siya nagbabakasyon samin. At first I really didn't mind, but now she's been staying with us for months. Minsan uuwi siya saglit sa naiwan niyang senior parents pero babalik din samin, tapos ilang months na stay naman ulit.

When she started reviewing for the boards, may mga paperworks na pinapagawa sakanya husband ko. Tapos babayaran niya maliit, minsan di na binabayaran kasi yung stay niya dito sagot na namin lahat. So yan din isang reason why she needed to stay here with us.

I would say na close naman kami ni SIL. We get along pretty well, I treat her sa mga self-care dates, nilalabas ko siya to eat samgyup na kaming dalawa lang, sinasama ko siya sa gym, etc. That's just me being a good big sister she never had.

But lately it's ""exhausting"" to constantly have her around. We have two kids here at home which she babysits when needed (and I'm grateful for that) plus two helpers pa so just imagine our grocery bill.

And yung feeling na gusto kong chumill alone sa living room during my free time, di ko magawa kasi she’s just hanging around all the time. I don't know if batugan is the right term pero every day she wakes up past 12 noon, pagkagising rekta kain ng lunch, tapos hihilata na yan sa sofa.

Ang selfish nito pakinggan pero mga times na gusto ko umorder ng iced coffee, di ko magawa kasi kailangan ko pa siya idamay sa order if ever kasi ang pangit naman kung sarili ko lang ioorder ko diba.

Ilang weeks na nakalipas since she passed the boards. Now she's just waiting for her oath taking in a few days. Pero wala pa din siyang ginagawang kahit anong effort para maghanap ng trabaho, kesyo sa January pa daw mass hiring ng hospital na gusto niya applyan, or need pa daw oath taking bago magapply. Ok gets she's taking her time, pero grabe she's really taking her damn precious time!! Hindi sa pagmamayabang pero ako nun gigil na maghanap ng trabaho at nahire na ko even before my graduation. Ganun ako kaatat kumita ng sarili kong pera.

Eh itong si SIL, hindi naman nanggaling sa well off na pamilya. Sa katunayan, kami pa ng dalawa niyang kuya nagbayad ng tuition niya makapagtapos lang. Both senior parents niya wala na din work, living off pension na lang. Pero sobrang wala siyang kahit anong proactiveness para makatulong man lang sa magulang niya. Sobrang spoiled jusko!

I've already discussed this with my husband, trust me. Pero very maingat ako kasi I don't want to come off as matapobre or madamot. No matter how much people say na ""your husband should side with you,"" it just feels weird to let him know lahat ng nararamdaman ko kasi parang mali. Hindi ko pinagdadamot ang kung ano man meron kami, my point lang is, HANGGANG KAILAN BA NAMIN SIYA BUBUHAYIN.",17,1765953988.0,OffMyChestPH,16,0.84,False

Life improved dramatically when the doc took me off antidepressants but not because of the med change. It improved because I also permanently abolished isolating and stagnating hobbies and chose to claim straightedge and get a vasectomy.

I’d been actively suicidal while taking the meds and not pursuing therapy. My life wasn’t improving while stationarily isolating from the world and relationships. It was only growing worse... in fact, it was a rather cyclical process. I noticed emotional pits related to owning my first Xbox 360 and seeking unfulfilling online relationships on VC with other gamers. I actually smashed that system against a coffee table in front of someone after attempting to explain my emotional downturn for a few weeks or months prior.

It seemed to be received as complaints about a money thing when I was just begging for a more fulfilling life and communicating the state of my mental health and what seemed to be attributing to a lack of fulfillment and isolating depression.

I was never, nor did I ever intend to be or want to be a ""gamer"" but I did use an Xbox 360 as a crutch to protect me from connecting with what I perceived to be unhealthy and undesirable influences while living in certain inescapable situations.

My mind craves novelty, exploration, fresh environments and new, healthy connections and collaborative effort. Many people have these needs but they fulfill them without even knowing it through working, even when the work seems miserable... they're meeting social and collaborative needs with a sense of purpose and routine. 

They're enriching their life in more than financial ways.

I just spent the last 5 or so years, through covid until recently biking, skating, singing and being openly social with photography and videography for performance artist friends and acquaintances. I even lived a year with a lovely person I met at a kink event. I also worked full time as a dish tech at a number of restaurants; Carrabba's, Bad Brad's, Stoney Creek Roadhouse... and part time at Magoo's Pet Outlet.

Turns out, what I needed was novelty and social connection. Just as I had and thrived with during childhood... I even shared my experiences on socials and recorded helmet cam footage to feel known and seen.

I only needed authentic connection and fulfillment to avoid the suffering and self-loathing.

There is also no foundational evidence that SSRIs do anything to directly influence mood.

Getting off was the best decision I ever made, along with abolishing video games, dropping the dead weight of undesired and unplayed musical instruments I only bought because someone suggested them, disconnecting from unhealthy influences, cutting drug connections and reconnecting with old friends from childhood.

During a number of crucial moments in my development, and for a great length of time and neurological adaptation, I was locked in facilities wherein which my only responsibility was sleep and wait for instructions.

I have developed a very powerful, intrinsic desire to wait, often overpowering any and all other urges to live, especially with the slightest hint that I might disappoint anyone or piss them off.

Understanding that with certain conditions I can thrive, identifying those conditions and surrounding myself with novel and educational coping skills and creative tools might be some of the only ways to motivate me.

If I can continue connecting and staying in touch with people, maintaining discourse and feeling encouraged to try, learn and do... I might have a chance at life but I cannot allow myself to simply be directed and silenced anymore.

Nor can I accept when people tell me I don't ""need to know"" something. Any level of curiosity of the human mind requires satisfaction. Otherwise, we truly do feel unfulfilled, unmotivated to try, devalued and worthless.

I've got lots of missing context of experience and education mixed with this cognitive conditioning of learned helplessness.

Historically, wasted time only becomes spirals of internalized shame, self-blame, depression and eventual suicidal ideation.

I'm no longer pretending to care about playing an instrument, holding onto video games expecting people to drop in and play them or self-isolating with them as intentional social defense, worrying about whether people want to know me or just feed me drugs to fit me in, terrified over whether someone's just going to pump me for sperm and seed a baby... I'm in therapy and I'm becoming aware of myself and my goals.

Media capture and editing; photo, video and audio plus the process of working toward a project's completion in front of a computer has been one of the more beautiful ways I've found to meet my collaborative and creative needs as well as a need for challenge and accomplishment.

From here, I have the ability to connect with others, discern my next move and realize healthy decisions for my future.",1,1765953567.0,self,0,0.67,False

At first okay naman yung friendship namin, I feel honored and amazed na may friend akong rich na para bang akoy chosen one hahahaha kasi naman iba talaga yung life namin, ibang course, ibang lifestyle and etc., naging close kami dahil sa pag inom (retired alakera girlie na ako now) so ayun mabait naman sya, kumakain kami sa labas, coffee dates and do errands together, okay naman kami not until I realized na everytime na sya kasama ko kahit saglit lang, I feel heavy na ang sama ng pakiramdam ko na nagkakasakit na ako, and my house mate noticed it also, na pag siya kasama ko ang heavy ng aura ko after, with other friends naman hindi ganun.

This all started a couple of weeks ago when a random guy approached me. He acted very happy and surprised to see me and ran up to me on my university campus. He started talking about how I looked and how he did not expect me to be on campus at that time. What really stood out to me was that he was using my name. I was so confused because I had never seen this man before. I figured maybe I had met him at a party at some point and just forgot. I acted like I remembered him, like one does, and we had a pretty decent conversation about school and life. It was a little awkward for me, but he did not seem bothered by it at all and was very talkative. It felt like I had known him for a while even though I did not remember him.

Even though he clearly wanted to keep talking, I had class in a couple of minutes, so I told him I had to leave. Instead of going about his day, he asked if he could come with me. I told him I did not mind, and after class we spent basically the entire day together. I thought it was a little weird how clingy he was, but I brushed it off because I honestly thought he was really attractive and liked the attention.

A week later, I went to that same class again, and the same guy was there. I was very confused because I knew he did not take this class. He walked straight up to me when he saw me and asked if we could talk. I was obviously confused, so I skipped class since that lecture was also being recorded. We went to a coffee shop on campus and sat down. I was really nervous to hear what he had to say because he looked very distressed.

He told me that he was disappointed that I blocked him mid conversation and wanted to know why I did it. I had not taken his socials because he never asked, and I am not the type of girl who asks a guy for his number first, so I was even more confused. I told him I did not block him. He then showed me a profile with the no user found looking profile picture and said he could not view my profile anymore. I told him it was weird that something like that would happen. Then I followed him on my phone.

He noticed that it was not the same username as the account that had blocked him and asked if I had made a new account. I had previously deleted my old account, so I figured maybe he got confused with that somehow. I know I was being stupid, but when you are being confronted by a random guy, you tend to do anything to get yourself out of the situation. I followed him on my new account, and he walked me back to my dorm. After that, we started texting.

After two weeks of talking and hanging out in person, I decided to bring him to my dorm. This is where things get weird. My roommate was there when I brought him over. I love my roommate, and we clicked from the day we met. We have similar personalities and basically the same TikTok FYP, so we bounce off each other effortlessly. Living with her felt like living with my best friend.

When I brought him into our dorm, she made eye contact with him and literally gasped. She completely went pale, like she had seen a ghost. I did not know why, but I brushed it off and thought it was all in my head. After he left, she told me that I had to stop talking to him. She did not sugarcoat anything and straight up told me to stop speaking to him. I asked her why, and she would not tell me.

I finally snapped and told her that I really liked him, that he had asked me out earlier, and that I was going to be with him. That is when she broke down crying. She told me that she had actually been talking to him for months. I asked her why he did not recognize her if they had been talking, and she told me it was because she was using my photos and my name to talk to him. Apparently, after I met him for the first time, he texted her about how amazing our date was, and she blocked him because she knew she had been caught.

She told me she is still in love with him and that if I dated him, I would be breaking girl code. I am so pissed, but I also feel bad for her because I know she is very insecure. She is a bigger girl, and according to her, she does not have much luck in the dating world. I understand how she feels to a degree because I did catfish a guy when I was a kid, so I am trying to be empathetic.

It’s freezing outside,

so I’ll sit in front of the fireplace

to keep me warm.

exactly where you sat last year.

You’d poke the fire,

lay down with a blanket.

play with your cat,

and maybe even have a cup of coffee.

In the same room

you lost your life in.

I don’t think it’s fair.

Our last Christmas should be

when I’m 40

not 13.

Christmas lost it’s magic

extra early this year.

two and a half months to celebrate,

but this year it only felt like 2 weeks.

The closer the holidays get,

the more i miss you.

We’ll never be sitting in the living room again,

opening presents,

and thanking each other with hugs.

“I love you,

im sorry for being a brat.

I promise it wont happen again.”

is something I’ll never hear come out of my mouth again.

i miss you. 

Merry christmas.

1popfgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/test/comments/1popfgf/air_roasted_coffee_what_it_is_why_it_matters/,Air Roasted Coffee: What It Is & Why It Matters,"If you've ever wondered why some coffee tastes clean and bright while other coffee has a harsh, ashy aftertaste, the answer might be in how it was roasted.

Most coffee you'll find—from grocery store brands to your local café—is drum roasted, the industry standard for over a century. But there's another method that produces noticeably different results: air roasting. It's used by only 1-3% of roasters worldwide, but those who've tried it often never go back.

This guide explains what air roasted coffee is, how it differs from traditional drum roasting, and why it might be worth seeking out for your morning cup.

# What Is Air Roasted Coffee?

Air roasted coffee is exactly what it sounds like: coffee beans roasted by hot air rather than contact with a heated surface.

In traditional drum roasting, beans tumble inside a rotating metal cylinder that's heated from below. The beans roast primarily through contact with the hot metal (conduction) and secondarily through hot air inside the drum (convection).

Air roasting flips this equation. Beans are suspended on a powerful stream of hot air—they literally float inside the roasting chamber. They roast entirely through convection (hot air) rather than conduction (hot metal contact).

This method is also called **fluid bed roasting**, named after the physics principle where solid particles behave like a fluid when suspended by an upward flow of gas. Think of it like a popcorn popper, but with much more precise temperature control.

Air roasting was pioneered by Michael Sivetz, a chemical engineer and coffee scientist who wanted a cleaner, more controlled roasting process. Despite its advantages, the method never became mainstream—primarily because drum roasters can handle much larger batch sizes. Air roasters typically process 1-5 pounds at a time, while commercial drum roasters can handle 100+ pounds per batch.

For specialty coffee roasters focused on quality over volume, that trade-off is worth it.

# How Air Roasting Works (Fluid Bed Roasting)

Understanding the mechanics helps explain why air roasted coffee tastes different.

**Hot air flows upward through the roasting chamber.** In a fluid bed roaster, air heated to 400-500°F enters from below and flows upward through a bed of green coffee beans. The airflow is strong enough to lift and tumble the beans, keeping them constantly in motion.

**Beans are suspended and agitated by the airflow.** Unlike drum roasting where beans rest against hot metal, air roasted beans float and spin continuously. This means every surface of every bean gets even exposure to heat.

**Chaff is blown out immediately.** This is crucial. Every coffee bean has a thin, papery skin called chaff that separates from the bean during roasting. In drum roasters, this chaff gets trapped inside and often burns, mixing bitter compounds into the finished coffee. In air roasters, the chaff is blown out of the chamber the moment it separates—before it can burn.

**Roasting happens faster.** Because heat transfer through air is so efficient, air roasting typically takes 8-12 minutes compared to 12-20 minutes for drum roasting. This shorter time means less opportunity for the beans to develop burnt or bitter notes.

**Small batches allow precision.** Air roasters work best with smaller batches (1-5 pounds), which gives the roaster much more control over the final product. Each batch can be monitored and adjusted in real time.

# Air Roasted vs Drum Roasted: Key Differences

Here's how the two methods compare across the factors that matter most for your cup.

|Factor|Air Roasted|Drum Roasted|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Heat transfer**|Convection (hot air)|Conduction (hot metal) + some convection|
|**Chaff handling**|Blown away immediately|Trapped inside, often burns|
|**Batch size**|Small (1-5 lbs)|Large (10-100+ lbs)|
|**Roast time**|8-12 minutes|12-20 minutes|
|**Flavor profile**|Cleaner, brighter, more origin notes|Smokier, heavier, more roast notes|
|**Acidity**|Lower|Higher|
|**Body**|Lighter, cleaner|Fuller, heavier|

**Heat transfer and evenness.** Drum roasting relies heavily on contact with hot metal, which can create hot spots and uneven roasting. Beans touching the drum surface roast faster than those in the middle of the pile. Air roasting provides more even heat distribution because every bean is surrounded by hot air.

**Chaff and cleanliness.** In drum roasters, chaff accumulates and burns, creating bitter, ashy compounds that mix into the coffee. These compounds contribute to the ""smoky"" character some people associate with dark roasts—but it's often burnt chaff, not the coffee itself. Air roasting eliminates this entirely.

**Flavor clarity vs. roast character.** Air roasted coffee tends to showcase origin characteristics—the natural flavors of where and how the beans were grown. Drum roasted coffee often emphasizes roast characteristics—the flavors developed during the roasting process itself. Neither is objectively better, but they're distinctly different.

**Acidity and smoothness.** Air roasted coffee is typically less acidic and smoother on the palate. The even heat distribution prevents scorching, and the absence of burnt chaff removes a major source of harshness.

# Benefits of Air Roasted Coffee

Why choose air roasted coffee over the more common drum roasted variety?

**Cleaner, smoother taste.** Without burnt chaff contaminating the beans, air roasted coffee has a noticeably cleaner flavor. There's no ashy aftertaste, no smoky bitterness—just the natural flavors of the coffee itself.

**Better for sensitive stomachs.** Many people who experience stomach discomfort from coffee find that air roasted coffee doesn't bother them. The burnt compounds in drum roasted coffee can irritate the digestive system, and air roasting eliminates those compounds entirely.

**Lower perceived acidity.** Air roasted coffee is gentler on people with acid reflux or GERD. The even heat distribution prevents the scorching that increases acidity, and the clean roast has fewer irritating compounds.

**Brighter, more complex flavor notes.** When origin characteristics aren't masked by roast flavors, you can taste what makes different coffees unique. Ethiopian coffees taste more distinctly fruity, Brazilian coffees showcase their nutty sweetness, and so on.

**More consistent quality.** The controlled environment of air roasting produces more consistent results from batch to batch. Each roast develops predictably, reducing the variation you might find in drum roasted coffees.

**Environmentally cleaner.** Air roasting produces less smoke and fewer emissions than drum roasting because there's no chaff burning inside the roaster. It's a small difference, but it adds up over thousands of batches.

# Is Air Roasted Coffee Healthier?

This question comes up often, and the answer is nuanced.

**What air roasted coffee doesn't have:**

When chaff burns in drum roasters, it creates compounds including **acrylamide** and **polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)**. Both are potential carcinogens that have been studied extensively by food safety researchers.

* **Acrylamide** forms when organic materials are heated to high temperatures. It's found in many roasted, baked, and fried foods—including coffee roasted by any method. But air roasting reduces acrylamide formation because the chaff (a major source) is removed before it can burn.
* **PAHs** form when organic material burns incompletely. In drum roasting, burning chaff contributes to PAH levels in the finished coffee. Air roasting eliminates this source entirely.

**What both methods share:**

Air roasted and drum roasted coffee have similar levels of caffeine, antioxidants, and beneficial compounds. The health benefits of coffee—reduced risk of certain diseases, improved mental alertness, antioxidant protection—apply equally to both.

**The practical takeaway:**

Air roasted coffee is potentially healthier in one specific way: it eliminates certain harmful compounds created by burnt chaff. It's not a superfood, and switching from drum roasted to air roasted coffee isn't going to transform your health. But if you're concerned about minimizing exposure to acrylamide and PAHs, air roasted coffee is a reasonable choice.

The more noticeable health benefit for most people is digestive: air roasted coffee is simply gentler on the stomach. If regular coffee bothers you, air roasted coffee might not.

# How to Find Quality Air Roasted Coffee

Air roasted coffee isn't always easy to find, but here's what to look for.

**Check the packaging for ""air roasted"" or ""fluid bed roasted.""** Roasters who use this method typically mention it prominently because it's a differentiator. If the package doesn't say, it's almost certainly drum roasted.

**Small batch specialty roasters are more likely to air roast.** The economics of air roasting favor smaller operations focused on quality. Large commercial roasters rarely use this method because drum roasters handle higher volumes.

**Ask about roast date.** Freshness matters for any coffee, but especially for air roasted coffee where the clean flavors are the main attraction. Look for bags with a roast date (not a ""best by"" date) and aim to use the coffee within 2-4 weeks of roasting.

**Specialty grade beans pair best with air roasting.** Air roasting showcases origin characteristics, so it works best with high-quality beans (scored 80+ on the specialty coffee scale). Using commodity-grade beans in an air roaster would be like putting regular gas in a sports car—you'd miss the point.

**Whole bean preserves quality longer.** Pre-ground coffee starts losing flavor immediately after grinding. For the cleanest taste air roasting provides, grind your beans fresh just before brewing.

Our [Ethiopia Yirgacheffe](https://hiswordcoffee.com/products/ethiopia-natural-yirgacheffe) showcases what air roasting does best—the bright blueberry and citrus notes shine through without any burnt undertones. Every bag is roasted to order in small batches and ships within 48 hours of roasting.

# Frequently Asked Questions

# What is air roasted coffee?

Air roasted coffee is made using a fluid bed roaster that suspends beans on a stream of hot air instead of tumbling them in a heated metal drum. This blows away the papery chaff before it can burn, producing a cleaner, smoother cup without bitter or smoky off-flavors.

# Is air roasted coffee better than drum roasted?

For taste clarity and stomach sensitivity, yes. Air roasting produces a cleaner flavor that lets origin characteristics shine through. It's also gentler on digestion because there are no burnt compounds. However, some people prefer the smokier, heavier body of drum-roasted coffee—it comes down to personal preference.

# Does air roasted coffee have less acid?

Yes. Air roasting produces coffee with lower perceived acidity because even heat distribution prevents scorching that increases acidity, and the chaff is removed before burning eliminates acidic burnt compounds. People with acid reflux often find air roasted coffee easier to tolerate.

# Is air roasted coffee healthier?

In some ways, yes. Air roasting eliminates acrylamide and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) that form when chaff burns in drum roasters. These compounds are potential carcinogens. The health benefits come from what's NOT in air roasted coffee rather than additional nutrients.

# Why is air roasted coffee smoother?

Air roasted coffee is smoother because the chaff (papery bean skin) is blown away before it can burn. In drum roasting, chaff burns and creates bitter, ashy compounds that mix with the beans. Air roasting also provides more even heat distribution, preventing the scorched spots that cause bitterness.

# What is fluid bed roasting?

Fluid bed roasting is the technical term for air roasting. It's named after the physics principle where solid particles (coffee beans) behave like a fluid when suspended by an upward flow of gas (hot air). The beans float and tumble in the air stream, roasting evenly without touching hot metal surfaces.

Understanding how your coffee is roasted gives you another tool for finding coffee that fits your taste and your body. Air roasting isn't magic—it's simply a different approach that produces different results.

For those who value clean flavors, easy digestion, and tasting what makes each coffee origin unique, air roasted coffee is worth seeking out. Once you've experienced the difference, you'll understand why some roasters—and coffee lovers—are willing to trade volume for quality.
