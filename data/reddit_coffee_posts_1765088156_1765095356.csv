1pgd3dy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pgd3dy,[Haul] Christmas Sneaker Spree – 6 Pairs for the Family,"Christmas Gift Shopping Spree – My Agent Scrambled for 6 Awesome Sneakers! Size and Weight Estimates 🎄

Hey fashionistas! I finally finished shopping for Christmas gifts for the family – thanks to my reliable agent, I got 6 pairs of shoes, and I absolutely love my purchase. Let's take a look at which shoes I picked out for each family member!
Jordan 1 ( Fragment x Travis Scott ) – Size US13 – For my older brother—dude’s been begging for a new AJ1, and this timeless pick hits different.
CNY380=USD61 https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7461295629

CNY470=USD75 https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7463815868
New Balance 990 (classic gray dad shoe) – Size US9.5 – For my uncle—he’s all about comfort over everything, and NB990s are his go-to for weekend hikes and coffee runs.
CNY200=USD32 https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7464274182
Fear of God– Size US9.5 – My cousin’s a streetwear fiend—these sleek FOGs were a no-brainer, since he’s been eyeing the retail pair for months.

1pgd0bt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1pgd0bt/my_25f_roommate_27f_tried_to_fake_a_breakup/,"My (25F) roommate (27F) tried to fake a breakup between me and my boyfriend by catfishing me as him, and it turned into a neighborhood wide misunderstanding about an FBI investigation","For context, I’m 25, just want peace and iced coffee, and my boyfriend Evan (26M) is the soft spoken accountant who would never willingly create chaos. My roommate Jenna (27F), however, lives in her own cinematic universe and treats drama the way toddlers treat glitter: a life necessity.

Everything started when I woke up, checked my phone, and nearly dropped it. I had a text from a random number saved as “Evan ( real one),” which was already suspicious. The message said: “Hey babe its me Evan. I got new number bc FBI. we must break up now. I am focusing on football and cannot do love. do not call old number it has died spiritually.” Immediately, I knew several things: Evan does not play football, Evan does not talk like a medieval riddle salesman, Evan is not randomly joining the FBI, and Evan would rather eat a stapler than say a phone number died spiritually. So, I stormed out of my room with the energy of someone about to confront destiny.

I found Jenna perched on the kitchen counter, sipping yogurt through a straw while scrolling conspiracy theories at full focus. She looked at me dramatically and said, “You look distressed,” like she was expecting a confession about murder. I showed her the text, and she gasped loudly, clutching her chest like she was fainting in a Victorian play. “I KNEW IT,” she said. “HE’S BEEN ACTIVATED.” When I asked what that meant, she whispered, “Government operations. Or witness protection. Something spicy.” This, about a man who once cried because he dropped a muffin on the floor.

As I was trying to reason through that nonsense, my real boyfriend FaceTimed me, wearing a huge hoodie and holding a banana like a microphone. He asked why I texted him “are you secretly a football agent of the FBI,” and when I showed him the fake breakup message, he blinked twice and said, “Why does this sound like a middle schooler pretending to be an adult?” Jenna loudly whispered, “THAT’S HOW SPIES TEXT,” which did not help her case at all. Evan sighed and asked, “Why is Jenna whispering like she’s part of this?”

That’s when Jenna dramatically slid off the counter, clapped her hands like she was opening a seminar, and said, “OKAY. IT WAS ME. BUT I DID IT FOR LOVE, YOUR LOVE.” Then she explained that she skimmed an article titled “Stress Tests Strengthen Bonds,” assumed it was about relationships, and did not realize it was about strengthening steel. She only read the title. So she bought a burner SIM card, renamed herself in my contacts, drafted multiple breakup messages, and selected the one she felt had the most emotional resonance. She proudly added that she studied how men text by watching YouTube videos, and Evan simply said, “That explains a lot.”

While we were in the middle of loudly reacting to this revelation, our extremely nosey neighbor Mrs. Patel cracked open her door and asked if everything was alright because she heard shouting. Before I could answer, Jenna leapt into the hallway and declared, “WE ARE CONDUCTING A RELATIONSHIP EXPERIMENT,” to which Mrs. Patel responded with deep horror, asking if this was one of those new age things. Jenna, doubling down, said, “YES. VERY ADVANCED. FBI LEVEL.” Mrs. Patel gasped and slammed her door.

We thought that was the end of it. It was not. About an hour later, our Neighborhood Safety Group chat exploded with 27 new messages. Mrs. Patel had posted: “Residents, please be aware: There may be FBI involvement in Unit 3B. I overheard an experiment being conducted.” The replies spiraled instantly: “Should we evacuate?” “Are experiments allowed in the building?” and “Is this about the aliens? I KNEW IT.” Jenna saw all this and looked proud of herself, like her art was finally being appreciated. When I told her to fix it, she responded in the chat with, “Do not worry. The situation is under control. Everything is emotional, not physical,” which only made the panic worse.

Eventually we calmed the building down, but not before the damage was done: Evan blocked Jenna’s number for his personal safety, the neighborhood is still confused about whether we were involved in some kind of emotional FBI ritual, Jenna insists her fake breakup was a success because Evan called me immediately, and I had to publicly clarify that there were no spies, no experiments, and no government involvement, just poor judgment and a roommate who misread one sentence about metallurgy.

Jenna still claims, “Your relationship is stronger now, thanks to me,” Evan says, “Please keep her away from me,” and I’ve decided the only solution is to take a very long nap and possibly move to a cave.",1,1765094649.0,TwoHotTakes,8,0.6,False

I put it all down to variations in machines, grinders and beans. I since upgraded to a Eureka Mignon AP (GBW).

**The answer was simple and staring me right in the face the whole time. Use the biggest basket possible with 21-22g of coffee and around a 1:1.5 ratio eg: 21g in and 32g out. 30 secs (including 5 sec preinfusion at 60%) at 9 bar pressure.**

What I am now drinking as a result of these simple changes is the thick and syrupy, deep and dark espresso that I drank in coffee shops, yet was unable to replicate myself because I simply didn't think of filling my high-capacity Normcore basket even further. With a 0.3mm puck screen, the shower head stays clean too.

I think that you can replicate this on pretty much any budget espresso machine and grinder setup that meets the minimum standards, just find the largest basket you can, load it with coffee and use the lower ratio. Yum! :)",0,1765093884.0,espresso,6,0.5,False

Aria's POV



I stood in front of the chapel.



Pink roses and white lilies decorated every corner. My favorite flowers.



The guests were already seated. Soon, at the end of the red carpet would stand the man I once loved, waiting to marry his bride.



Everything was perfect.



Except I wasn't the bride.



“I really need to see Jace today.”



I begged the bodyguard blocking the door. A beat-up suitcase and two boxes sat at my feet. Everything I owned in the world.



""No you don’t. Get out of here,"" the bodyguard said icily.



I saw disgust in his eyes. Yeah I get it. No one has sympathy for the crazy ex who shows up at the wedding.



But I have my reason to be here.



""If you don't let me see him, I'll just stand here and all the guests will see me,"" I threatened under my breath.



Jace wouldn't want that. Especially not today.



Because today, he was marrying Delilah Hart.



She is the sister to Alpha Grayson Hart of Redstone Pack. A 100% high-society darling.



All the guys in the world knew that marrying Delilah would totally change their lives, including Jace.



So he made the easy call—marrying the lady who could turn him from a small-town nobody into a golden boy. And dump the girl who stayed by his side for last 4 years when he had nothing.



He didn’t want any guests to see me here. Because I represented his broke, embarrassing past. He wanted me nowhere near his glittering new world.



Tears stung my eyes as I thought of that. Like a knife was twisting in my chest.



“Let me in or I’m starting to yell.” I choked.



The bodyguard frowned. ""Wait here.""



He finally called somebody. A few minutes later, he waved me in.



I wiped my eyes and struggled into the hall with my suitcase and boxes.



Instantly, I felt out of place.



Everything reeked of wealth here. Expensive perfume. Manicured nails. Not a hair out of place. It was everything you imagined about the upper-class and way more.



And me?



I was wearing a baggy T-shirt and jeans. My sneakers had holes.



""God, a homeless. She stinks."" A woman mutter as I walked by.



No it couldn’t be. I just showered this morning. My hair still smelled like strawberries and coconut.



But poverty had a scent, apparently.



""Mr. Carter is inside."" The guard took me to a closed door and warned, “Make it quick.”



“Thank you.”



The room inside looked like something out of a movie. Marble floors. White carpet. A chandelier that probably cost more than my apartment.



And there he was.



The man I used to love.



Adjusting his bowtie in front of a mirror.



Jace was still heartbreakingly handsome. No wonder Delilah fell for him.



When he turned and fixed his gorgeous blue eyes upon me, I still felt my heart race.



""Hey, Jace,"" I said quietly.



And immediately, I wanted to punch myself.



Hey, Jace?!



That’s the best I could do?



His face was ice cold.



""You shouldn't come, Aria.” he said with a frown. “Your ratty suitcase, your ripped jeans, your Vans. None of that belongs here.""



Well if you wanted to be brutal and vicious, that’s how it’s done.



""Don’t you think I deserve an explanation? You dumped me over a fucking email!"" I snapped.



He shrugged. ""Look around you. The wealthiest people in the world came for me today. This suit I’m wearing cost more than you can make in your entire life. What more explanation do you want?""



Wow.



I always knew he was a cold, calculating bastard.



I just didn’t realize how deep it ran.



""Maybe chasing Alpha’s sister got you here faster. But you know what? When she finds out how shallow and cold you are. You’ll lose it all.""



Anger flared across his face.



""I know how to love someone! I just won't waste that on a small-town girl like you.” he said freezingly, “Are we done here?""



“No.”



I took a deep breath and got into the real reason I came.



""You're marrying a rich girl. Fine. But why did you have to get me fired?""



Yeah. I used to work for this jerk.



From intern to full-time at Apex Corp, he was my supervisor.



Our office romance was a secret. And just days ago, I found out he was getting married with Apex CEO’s sister. And I was out of a job thanks to him.



""Right, your job.” The jerk shrugged, “You got your job all thanks to me. Now that I’m not around, maybe they finally saw how incompetent and stupid you are. Problem?""



Was he fucking kidding me?!



""I graduated top of my class. Made it through 7 rounds of interviews. My performance exceeded every quarterly target. I earned that job!"" I snapped.



“Come on, Aria. You really gonna be so naïve?”



He walked closer, smirking.



""You passed the interviews because I said so. Your sales? I contacted those customers for you. Without me, you'd be nothing but a pretty face.""



He seized my chin and looked me over with a disgusting look. I slapped his hand away.



""Give me my job back,” I hissed, my voice slightly trembling. “My dad’s debt. My grandma’s medical bills…I need the money. You of all people should know what it’s like to be poor. Don’t. Make. Me. Beg.""



I was throwing my pride at his feet.



But he just laughed.



""Well, how about I offer you a deal?"" he said as though he’d been waiting for this moment.



He brushed my hair back, fingers trailing down to my collarbone. I shivered in disgust.



""You and I. We never fuck. You were so clinging to that pathetic no-sex-before-marriage rule. Maybe it's time to grow up. Let me fuck you once and I’ll write you very handsome check. How does that sound?""



I widened my eyes in shock.



Then I slapped him. HARD.



“FUCKING HELL…What the hell are you doing?! I’m getting married in front of everyone in fucking 10 minutes!” He roared covering his swollen face.



""Fuck you, Jace!” I yelled, “You're a spineless freeloading puss! And hey—congrats on the wedding. Hope your junk is soft like a fucking spaghetti tonight!""



Then I stormed out dragging my suitcase and boxes, ignoring his angry curses behind me.



Hot tears poured down as I dashed across the hallway.



God this couldn’t be any worse.



I was prepared to drop all my self-esteem and begged with my life. Because I needed the job and money.



But I still let him get to me.



Now what do I do?



My salary barely covered my rent, my father’s debt and grandma’s bill. Now with my job gone, I already got kicked out by my landlord. I probably had to sleep in a park tonight.



So do I go back and let that jerk win? Let him humiliate me...No. I’d rather die than that…



""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled.



Too late.



I slammed right into the man in front of me.



He was tall. So tall I felt like I’d just walked into a brick wall.



His diamond cufflink was sharp like a blade. When we collided, it sliced clean through my thin T-shirt with a loud rip.



In one second, the front of my shirt was torn open, exposing my white lace bra.



“Ah!” I gasped and looked up.



This was the most handsome man I’d ever seen. His face was like a statue carved by a master artist. And his expression was so cold and distant.



When he looked down at me, I swear I was about to drown in those stormy gray eyes of his.



Suddenly, I recognized who he was.



This was Alpha of Redstone Pack. CEO of Apex Corporation.



Jace’s brother-in-law.



THE legendary. Grayson Hart.



“Aria Collins?”



His voice was sexy and velvety.



He lowered his head and his eyes dropped to the exposed part of my bra. Maybe it was just my imagination, but the color of his eyes seemed to darken as he stared.



Wherever his gaze landed, my skin started burning up.



But wait.



How did he know my name?



Chapter 2 With Ex's Brother-in-law

Aria’s POV



Of course I recognized him. God, who didn’t?



I’d met him at the Apex gala. His face was on every finance magazine cover, and any time you turned on a TV, there he was—linked to the latest scandal with some actress or model.



But there was no way he’d know who I was.



“I-I…Hello, Alpha Grayson,” I stammered.



He turned his eyes away and said to a nearby guard, “Escort Ms. Collins out.”



“Yes, Alpha.”



The guards stepped in immediately, stretching out their arms like I was some kind of contaminant that might taint Grayson’s perfectly tailored suit.



“Wait a minute. You’re not going to say something about my shirt?” It’s torn beyond repair and was showing my breasts.



He paused. Just for a brief second. Then flicked something down at my feet.



I looked down. A blank check.



“I need a shirt that can cover my front. Not your hush money.” I gritted with humiliation.



But he didn’t even glance back and just walked away.



“God,” I muttered under my breath.



Can you believe these rich bastards?



They think they can buy everything with money.



People nearby were all staring, snickering under their breath. I tried to cover my chest and grab my things to escape, but it was hard to do all that with just two hands.



“Oh my god…Aria Collins?”



Three girls emerged from the whispering crowd. I took one look at them and sighed internally.



Great. Just when I thought today couldn’t get any worse.



“Hello. Layla. Sabrina. Brielle.” I said dryly.



I used to work in the same team with these girls back at Apex. We were all under Jace.



These girls adored Jace. They spent more time flirting with him by the coffee machine than actually working. Which left me doing most of their work.



After I got fired, and when news of my secret relationship with Jace got out, they decided I was public enemy number one.

Although much of it was combined with earlier knowledge mostly attributed to phycisists and electricians in the late 20th century, created in Nokia labs in 1961, the first digital microphone and speaker were created and properly distributed across North America. It was at this time that popular culture began to surge. When white Americans got tired of profiling and torturing their fellow compatriots, they decided to pivot into arts and music to alleviate the stress created from microdosing cocaine at the workplace and methamphetamies: specifically housewives which could not stand the sound of their 6 annoying children any longer. Although this creation was clearly overshadowed, in terms of American modern culture (and consequentially, western modern popular culture) by peanut butter and cookies and cream ice cream, the development of the microphone and speaker play a tremendous role to what we know see and fantasize about as being the “analog” days: a time when the line between modern computing and older technological applications began to be drawn. This brings me to talk about the speaker: when you watch old movies or documentaries, it is not the the peoples’ voices were that low and slow. It is just the fact that speakers were not in a technology yet where they could afford to transmit the lower frequencies from a recording, which also led to microphones not capturing them. This also meant that the music which was most enjoyed at the time would be obnoxious tunes with almost no depth to them or physically present background notes or grooves. You can attribute much of the jazz movement to this: because let’s be honest, there were not that many smart people in America to comprehend the geniuses which lived and played brass and string instruments, they just enjoyed high frequency sounds from their underpowered speakers at the time. When you imagine a 1970s, or 1980s businessman from a Hollywood movie, which by the way, I do not watch. You think of their bright crimson carpet at the penthouse, or maybe the floor below the penthouse of a mid sized skyscraper on the shittier parts of New York City. These business founders which really practiced tax fraud, substance abuse and intrapersonal connection as a way of negotiating and gaining ground on the market would think of their bright office covered in gaudy shiny gold framed furniture, dark oak wood desks and an unbearable amount of cigar residue on the ceiling, enough where a modern inspector might consider worse than the asbestos they were breathing, would become the stereotype. It was not the half open door with a view of tall Manhattan skyscrapers, the smell of gasoline from the under efficient cars at the time, which the monkey brained people focused on putting as much fuel into each cylinder, as many cylinders into each engine and as least safety equipment as possible into each vehicle which made people snort cocaine after skipping sugar on their morning black coffee, but rather the idea that they were living a dream and would consider themselves lucky to have more STDs than divorces.",1,1765093090.0,Streamofconsciousness,0,1.0,False

CHAPTER 1



DANTE



⪼⚔︎♛⚔︎⪻



The Crimson Room wasn’t a place for innocent little girls.



It was a place where grown women came to surrender control, to let men like me strip away their pretenses along with their clothes.



So what the fuck was she doing here?



I leaned against the bar, nursing a glass of Jameson and watching the brunette who’d been eye-fucking me for the past hour. She was sitting alone at a corner table, wearing a skimpy black dress which I suspected was really uncomfortable.



Like the dress, everything else about her screamed that she didn’t belong.



The way she kept fidgeting with her purse. The way her eyes darted around the room like she expected someone to arrest her for being here. The way she’d been nursing the same vodka tonic since she’d arrived.



“She’s been asking about you,” Seamus, my bartender and one of my oldest friends, said as he polished a glass. “Wants to know if the rumors are true.”



“What rumors?”



“That you’re the King of Dublin’s underworld.” He grinned. “And that you fuck like the devil himself.”



I actually laughed. “And what did you tell her?”



“That she should be careful what she wishes for.” His expression turned serious. “She’s not one of our usual clientele, boss. She’s got that look—like she’s here to prove something to herself.”



I studied her more carefully. Italian features, probably mid-twenties, with a bone structure that belonged in Renaissance paintings. Nervous energy radiated off her in waves, but there was determination mixed with desperation.



Dangerous combination.



“She keeps looking at you,” Seamus continued. “Like she’s working up the courage to do something stupid.”



As if summoned by his words, the brunette stood up, smoothed down her dress, and walked straight toward me. Her hips swayed with each step, but her hands were trembling slightly. Whatever she was about to do, it was taking every ounce of courage she had.



“You’re him,” she said when she reached me, her accent thick and undeniably Italian. “You’re Dante Cummiskey.”



“Depends who’s asking.” I turned to face her fully, and Christ, she was even more beautiful up close. Dark eyes that reminded me of expensive coffee, skin like cream, lips that were made for sin. “And you are?”



“No one important.” She lifted her chin, trying to look confident and failing miserably. “I heard you… I heard you take women home sometimes.”



“Sometimes.” I kept my voice neutral, but inside I was fascinated. Most women who approached me here were experienced, knew exactly what they were getting into. This one looked like she’d never been in a room like this before, let alone participated in what happened here. “What exactly did you hear?”



Her cheeks flushed pink, but she didn’t back down. “That you’re into… things. Dark things.”



“I am.” I stepped closer, and she automatically stepped back until she was pressed against the bar. “The question is, mo stór, are you?”



“I want to be.”



Four words. That’s all it took to completely shift the dynamic between us. Because despite the nerves, despite the obvious inexperience, there was something in her voice that told me she meant it.



“Do you now?” I reached out, trailing one finger along her bare arm, and felt her shiver. “And what makes you think you could handle what I do to women in my bed?”



“I can handle it.” Her voice was stronger now, more determined. “I need to handle it.”



“Need to?” That was an interesting choice of words. “And why is that, love?”



Something flickered across her face—pain, anger, maybe both. “Because I’m tired of being good and proper and fucking perfect.” The curse word sounded foreign on her tongue, like she didn’t use it often. “Tonight, I want to be something else.”



I studied her face, looking for any sign that this was some kind of setup or game. But all I saw was raw honesty and a desperation that made my cock stir despite my better judgment.



“What’s your name?”



“Does it matter?”



“It does to me.”



She hesitated. “Lucia.”



Just Lucia. No last name, no details, a made up name, nothing that could identify her beyond this moment. Smart girl.



“Well then, Lucia,” I said, my voice dropping to that tone that made grown women drop to their knees. “If you come home with me tonight, you need to understand something. I don’t do gentle. I don’t do sweet. I don’t do making love.”



Her breath hitched, but she didn’t pull away.



“What I do,” I continued, leaning closer until my mouth was inches from her ear, “is bondage. I discipline. I possess. I fuck. I push limits until they break, and then I push a little further.”



“I understand.”



“You do?” I pulled back to look at her. “Once we leave this place, once I get you alone, I’ll not be asking you that. You’ll be mine for the night, completely and utterly. Your pleasure, your pain, your fucking breath—it all belongs to me until morning. And the only thing I’ll expect from you in return is submission. Utter fucking submission.”



She swallowed hard, and I could see her pulse racing in her throat. But when she spoke, her voice was steady.



“I want that.”



Christ, she was going to be the death of me.



“Then finish your drink, mo stór,” I said, signaling Seamus for the check. “Because we’re leaving. Now.”



⪼⚔︎♛⚔︎⪻



LUCIA



⪼⚔︎♛⚔︎⪻



I’m officially damaged goods.



Fifteen minutes later, we reached Dante’s penthouse and the elevator doors slid open forty floors up. We stepped into what could only be described as… a monster’s lair.



Everything in the room was sleek, expensive, and… wrong.



The sofa looked ordinary until I noticed the iron cuffs hidden in the frame. The coffee table gleamed, but its edges were too sharp, its compartments too carefully disguised.



The paintings on the walls weren’t art. They were blasphemy scenes that would’ve made a priest faint on sight.



My throat went dry. “This is…” I struggled for the right word. “Sadistic.”



His mouth curved like he’d been waiting for me to say it. “What did you expect?”



“A normal bedroom,” I admitted, heat rising in my cheeks.



“Who said I’m normal?”



I shivered, hugging myself. What if I’d just fallen into the hands of a human trafficker?



Then his voice dropped, dark and commanding: “Take off your dress.”



The words were quiet. Absolute.



For a moment, my knees nearly buckled. I wasn’t ready. God, I wasn’t ready. But what choice did I have?



My fingers trembled as I reached behind me, tugging at the zipper. The red silk slid from my shoulders, pooled at my feet. My heart thundered so loud it drowned the silence.



His eyes devoured me. I wanted to vanish, to cover myself, but the only shield I had were my arms, and even those, he wouldn’t allow.



“Look at me, Lucia.”



I raised my head slowly. Shame and fear burned across my face, but I held his gaze anyway, because running now would mean I’d never escape tomorrow.



“You’re beautiful,” he said softly. And I hated how my chest ached at the sincerity in his voice.



Then his tone hardened. “But hiding isn’t how this works. Drop your arms.”



I froze. My arms were the last barrier between me and him. If I lowered them, I’d be exposed in a way no man had ever seen.



But slowly, painfully, I let them fall. The air touched me like a thousand eyes. My chin wobbled, but I didn’t look up.



“Better,” he murmured, stepping closer. “Why are you really here, Lucia?” he asked.



The question sliced me open. Why was I here? Because tomorrow my cage door would slam shut, and I couldn’t breathe at the thought?



“Because tomorrow my life ends,” I whispered.



“Dramatic,” he said, though his voice betrayed curiosity. “What does that mean?”



Tears pricked my eyes. “Tomorrow I’ll become someone else’s property. A stranger’s. I don’t even know his name. And once that ring is on my finger, I’ll never belong to myself again.” My lips trembled, but I forced the words out. “So tonight, just for tonight… I want to belong to someone I chose.”



He stared at me for a while, then his hands lifted to cradle my face, and the heat of them nearly undid me.



“What’s his name?” he demanded.



“I don’t know.”



“You don’t know?” His eyes flared.



“They haven’t told me yet,” I admitted, and the humiliation of it nearly cracked my voice.



Silence.



Then his thumb brushed my cheek. His tone dropped to something wicked. “Then let’s make sure your last night of freedom is one you never forget.”



He spun me toward the glass, pressing me against the window, the city glittered beneath my reflection. His hand landed on my hip—firm, claiming.



“Have you ever been tied up before, Lucia?”



My heart leapt. “N-no.”



“Has a man ever put his mouth on your cunt?”



I shook my head, shame crawling hot across my skin.



“Have you ever been fucked so hard you forgot your own name?”



“I’ve… I’ve never been fucked at all,” I whispered, so low I almost hoped he wouldn’t hear.



But he did.



He stilled behind me. For the first time, I thought I caught something almost human in his silence.



“You’re a virgin?”



“Yes.”



I waited for laughter, for mockery, for disgust. Instead, his grip tightened on my hips.



“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,” he muttered.



I swallowed, forcing my chin high. “Virginity is just another kind of perfection, isn’t it?”



His eyes burned like fire meeting gasoline. “It is, little rabbit. It is.”



Chapter 2\~ What I’ll Never Have

CHAPTER 2



LUCIA



⪼⚔︎♛⚔︎⪻



Holy Mother of God, what have I done?



Standing in the middle of Dante Cummiskey’s penthouse in nothing but scraps of black lace, I was pretty sure I’d officially lost my damn mind.



This wasn’t how I’d imagined losing my virginity. Growing up, I’d pictured candlelight and rose petals, gentle whispers of love, maybe even a wedding ring.



Not standing half-naked in a sex dungeon, with Dublin’s city lights twinkling mockingly below.



Look at the good Catholic girl about to get ruined by the King of the Underworld.



Well, fuck them. And fuck being good.



Tomorrow I’d be Mrs. Whatever-His-Name-Is, property of a man I’d never met, condemned to a lifetime of missionary position and rosary beads. So tonight I was going to sin so spectacularly that even the devil himself would be impressed.



“You’re overthinking,” Dante’s voice cut through my spiral, rich with amusement and curiosity. “I can practically hear the wheels turning.”



If only he knew what those wheels were planning.



See, here’s the thing nobody tells you about being the perfect mafia princess: you learn to be sneaky as hell. You learn to smile while plotting, to curtsy while cursing, to look innocent while planning the most beautiful revenge imaginable.



My revenge was standing six feet of dangerous temptation away from me, looking at me like I was his next meal.



Dante Lorcan Cummiskey was absolutely perfect for what I needed. Ruthless enough that he wouldn’t give a damn about consequences. Rich enough that my father couldn’t touch him. Experienced enough that he’d know exactly how to ruin me in all the right ways.



Most importantly? He was the type of man who’d disappear after one night and never look back. Perfect for a girl who wanted to leave behind a very specific type of… souvenir.



God, I hope this works.



“Come here,” he commanded, and the authority in his voice made my knees go weak. This was a man used to being obeyed, used to taking what he wanted. The complete opposite of everything I’d been raised to expect from men.



My legs moved before my brain caught up, bringing me close enough to feel his dangerous aura. Close enough to see the predatory satisfaction in those emerald eyes as he watched me submit to his command.



This is really happening.



“Do you know what you’re asking me to do to these perfect tits?” His fingers traced the edge of my bra, barely touching but making me shiver anyway.



“I know.” The lie came easily. I had no idea what he meant, but I was desperate enough to find out.



His laugh was low and rich, like expensive whiskey. “Liar. Your pulse is racing like a rabbit’s.” His thumb moved to press against the rapid flutter at my throat. “But that’s not necessarily fear, is it?”



Heat flooded my cheeks. How did he know?



“Tell me what you want, Lucia,” he commanded softly, his hand sliding down to rest at the base of my throat. Not threatening, but promising. “And don’t give me some sweet, innocent answer. Tell me what you really want.”



What did I want?



Everything. All of it. Whatever this is.



I wanted to feel alive before I died inside tomorrow. I wanted to know what it meant to burn, to ache, to come with a stranger’s fingers still inside me. I wanted to understand why grown women whispered about such things with flushed faces and secret smiles.



Most of all, I wanted to take something for myself before everything else was taken from me.



“I want…” The words stuck in my throat, a lifetime of proper breeding making it nearly impossible to voice such desires.



“You want what, love?”



His patience surprised me. I’d expected him to simply take what he wanted– that’s what men like him did, wasn’t it? But there he was, waiting to let me find my courage.



Maybe that’s why he’s so dangerous. He makes you want to give him everything.



“I want to feel,” I whispered finally. “I want to know what I’m going to be missing for the rest of my life.”



Something shifted in his expression– satisfaction, maybe, or recognition. Almost like I’d finally said something he understood.



“Then feel,” he said simply. He stepped closer, crowding me against the floor-to-ceiling windows. The glass was cold against my back. Very cold. “Problem is, you look like the type of girl who expects flowers and poetry and gentle kisses under starlight.”



My heart hammered against my ribs. “I don’t want any of that.”



“No?” His thumb brushed across my lower lip, and I had the strangest urge to bite it. “Then what do you want, mo stór? Tell me exactly.”



I want you to destroy me. I want you to ruin me so thoroughly that my future husband will know exactly what kind of woman he’s getting. I want you to put a baby in me so I can watch my father’s face when he realizes his perfect little alliance is built on a lie.



But I couldn’t say that to the arrogant sex god I was about to steal from.



“I want…” I swallowed hard, gathering every ounce of courage I possessed. “I want you to show me what I’ll never have.”



His brows lifted like he’d heard something in my voice that I hadn’t meant to reveal.



“And what makes you think you’ll never have this?” His hand slid down to rest at my throat, not squeezing but possessive. “You think your arranged husband is going to be too old to give you an orgasm?”



Clever bastard.



“That’s not—”



“Love, you’re not exactly subtle.” He leaned closer, his breath warm against my ear. “I need you to understand that I’ll kill you with the same hands I’ll use to give you multiple orgasms tonight if you intend to make me a major plot point in your Damsel In Distress life story.”



I swallowed. “What?”



His fingers traced down my throat to the swell of my breasts above my bra. “Think about that really hard while I fuck you.”



Oh.



But instead of turning around and running out of this room, I did something that surprised even me. I reached up and started unbuttoning his shirt.



His hand caught my wrist instantly, stopping me. “What are you doing?”



“What does it look like?” I tried to pull free, but his grip was iron. “You said you were going to fuck me—”



“I am.” His voice had gone dangerously soft. “But I'm a dominant. So we do this my way, at my pace. You don’t get to control anything that happens here. Understood?”



I nodded once.



“By letting me fuck you, you’ll be agreeing to becoming my submissive for the night.”



I nodded again.



He shook his head. “That’s not enough. I need you to sign an NDA stating that I have your consent.”



My jaw dropped. “A legal contract just to have sex?”



He backed away towards a drawer, eyes still holding mine, and produced a single file and a biro which he held out in front of me. “You don’t have to read it. Just sign.”



Holding his eyes, I took the biro and drew a simple ‘Lucia’ across the required space before handing it back to him.



He smirked. “Good girl.”



A thrill shot through me at his words, equal parts terror and excitement. “I’m very curious now. Kiss me.”



For a moment, he just stared at me. Then his mouth curved in a smile that was pure predator. “Save your lips for your husband,” he said, and my heart plummeted. “I don’t do kisses.”



No. No, no, no.



Panic flooded through me. If he didn’t kiss, what else didn’t he do? What if he insisted on protection? What if he was one of those careful men who thought everything through? My entire plan would crumble before it even began.



“I’m very clean,” I began. “I’m AA. No STDs. Blood type O. No previous sex partners. HIV negative. No Herpes. I could show you all the test results if you’d just let me get my phone from my purse. I swear I’m very…”



“Not interested.” His hands moved to my shoulders, turning me to face the window. I could see our reflection in the glass—him fully clothed and in control, me barely dressed and completely at his mercy. “You want to know what you’ll be missing? Then shut up and let me show you.”



His hands skimmed down my sides, and I shivered at the contact. This was nothing like the fumbling touches and the few chaste pecks I’d experienced with my late fiancé under my father’s watchful eye.



“Has anyone ever touched you like this?” His fingers traced the edge of my panties, not quite where I needed them but close enough to make me gasp.



“No.” The word came out strangled.



“Good.” There was satisfaction in his voice, dark and possessive. “I like being first.”



If only you knew just how many firsts you’re going to be.



His hand slipped beneath the lace, and I nearly jumped out of my skin at the contact. I’d touched myself before—what girl hadn’t?—but having someone else’s hands on me was an entirely different experience.



“Jesus, you’re responsive,” he murmured, and I could hear the smile in his voice. “I’ve barely touched you and you’re already trembling.”



I wanted to say something clever, something that would make me seem less pathetically innocent, but then his fingers moved in a way that made coherent thought impossible.



Oh. Oh my.



This was what all the whispers were about. This was why married women got that secretive look when they thought no one was watching. This was what I’d been missing, locked away in my ivory tower of virtue and propriety.



“Stop thinking,” Dante murmured against my ear, his free hand moving to brace against the window beside my head. “Just feel.”



But I couldn’t stop thinking.



With his eyes solely holding my gaze, he shifted my panties aside and flicked a single finger over my already sloppy clit. The gasp that escaped my lips made him raise a single brow.



“Either you find me extremely hot, which is weird considering I’m still dressed, or you’re just a natural creamer.” He grinned, ""Whichever it is, rest assured I’m going to enjoy ruining this pussy.”



Is this what it feels like to burn?



Wait. What was I burning from? Embarrassment, shame, or desire?



Chapter 3\~ Begged Me To Ruin Her

CHAPTER 3



DANTE



⪼⚔︎♛⚔︎⪻



She was a fucking contradiction wrapped in black lace.



Standing there against my windows like some fallen angel, all trembling innocence and desperate courage. She’d practically begged me to ruin her, and Christ, I was more than willing to oblige.



But watching her now, pulse hammering in that delicate throat, eyes wide with want and terror, I found myself wanting to take my time with her corruption.



Too bad the universe had other fucking plans.



“You’re thinking again,” I murmured as I let my fingers trace the edge of her panties. The little gasp she made went straight to my cock. “Didn’t I tell you to stop that?”



“I can’t help it.” Her voice was breathless and honest. Most women who ended up in my bed knew how to perform, knew exactly what sounds to make and when. But Lucia was real. Raw.



Dangerous as fuck.



“What’s going through that pretty head of yours?”



She turned to meet my eyes in the reflection, and the honesty there nearly undid me. “I’m thinking about what you’re going to do to me.”



“And?”



“It feels too good.” The admission came out like a confession, and I felt my control slip another notch. “Even the parts that scare me.”



Jesus. When was the last time a woman had admitted to being scared of me while simultaneously begging for more? When was the last time I’d cared what they were thinking about while I fucked them senseless?



My hand moved against her clit, drawing another sweet little moan from those perfect lips. “You should be scared, love. I’m not known for being gentle with my toys.”



“I don’t want gentle.” She pressed back against me, and the trust in that simple movement made my chest tight. “I want—”



The sound of my private elevator engaging made her eyes go wide with fear.



I stopped.



Only three people had access to that lift. My housekeeper, Mrs. O’Brien, who was visiting her grandchildren in Cork. My driver, Tommy, who was currently parked outside with strict orders to stay put until I called. And my second-in-command, who knew better than to interrupt me unless the world was literally on fire.



“Fuck.” I stepped back from Lucia, already reaching for a gun. “Get dressed. Now.”



“What?” She spun around, confusion and hurt flickering across her flushed features. “What’s wrong?”

Three days before the wedding, I went to try on my gown. It was a white dress with an elaborate design with lots of laces and tulle on the skirt. As the seamstress pinned the sides and adjusted the length, I looked in the mirror and felt excited. I wanted to show it to Craig, and see his face light up when he saw it. There was nothing I didn’t share with him.



Lucy, my stepmother, looked me over and smiled thinly. “You look good, Bella,” she said quietly.



“Thanks mom!” I replied. “Can I show this to Craig?”



She shook her head. “No, we follow the rules. It's a bad omen for the bride and groom to meet so close to the wedding.”



“Please mom,” I whined. “I won’t show it on me. Just the dress in the box. He’ll be so happy. It’s only bad to meet the day before,” I added. “Not three days before.”



“It’s bad,” she said firmly. “You will see him at the rehearsal dinner tomorrow with everyone. And that’s it!”



I didn’t want to argue because Lucy was pretty stubborn usually. I sighed and nodded. “Okay…”



But the excitement stayed with me. It felt like bubbles in my chest. After the fitting, I held the garment bag and thought about Craig’s smile. I told myself I would be quick. I would show him the dress, still in the bag, then come right back fast. Lucy wouldn’t even come to know.



I fell for Craig when I was a sophomore in college. He was a senior. He helped me carry books on a rainy day and walked me to the parking lot. We started texting, then going for coffee. He asked about my classes and remembered small things. I liked that, and over time I started to love him.



After college, he kept seeing me. We met each other’s families. My father, Jared Williams, ran a fashion house, so there were events and shows. Craig came with me, smiled for photos, and held my hand. He was the only heir of his parents with two hotels.



The night he proposed, we were on the terrace of his parents’ hotel. There were lights and music. He went down on one knee with a ring. I was so thrilled that I said yes right away. We fixed a wedding date with our families. We booked the hall, picked flowers, and chose the cake. I kept a list for everything, doing things personally even though my father had a fleet of personnel to work for me.



As soon as Lucy left our wedding boutique, I snuck out. I put the gown in my car and drove to Craig’s apartment. I had a key he gave me months ago. He had said, “Use it when you want to surprise me.” I smiled at the memory. The building had a private elevator. I rode up and stepped into his foyer.



The living room was quiet. I set the garment bag on the sofa and called out softly, “Craig?” There was no answer. His shoes were by the door, and his jacket was on a chair. He had to be home.



I walked down the hall toward the bedroom. As I got closer, I saw a trail of clothes on the floor. A red lace top, a silk skirt, bra and panties, and a pair of heels tipped on their sides. I stopped and blinked. It looked like someone undressed in a hurry. I smiled to myself. “Must be Evan,” I whispered. Craig’s younger cousin liked to drop by without warning with a date. I rolled my eyes and decided to leave. I picked up the garment bag and turned to go when I heard a soft sound. It was a low breathy moan from Craig’s bedroom. Feeling embarrassed, I increased my pace. But froze the next moment when a man’s voice came through the door, rough and loud. “Mayaaaa!”



Shock rippled through me and I stopped moving. Was that Craig’s voice? No, God, no. My first thought was that I misheard. My stepsister, Maya, hadn’t come back to the city in four years. She never showed her face to us even once ever since she left after that fight. I turned over my shoulder to look at the half-closed bedroom door. Despite myself, I turned back. I reached and saw that the door was slightly open. The room was dim, but I could see enough.



Craig was in bed with a woman. Her long brown hair fell across the pillow. He was holding her, naked, and moving inside her. He said her name again, “Oh, Maya!”



Everything in me went quiet as my mind numbed in shock. I stood there for a few seconds, my hands turning clammy, my heart thundering. Craig and Maya together? When did this happen? I had read about this happening in books. You know, just fiction. But this cliché happened in real life as well?



The world tilted so fast I felt dizzy. I slapped my hand on my mouth to stop the sound of my gasp. My mind clicked through little details when I turned around. I noticed a glass of water on the nightstand was half full. There was a smudge of lipstick on the rim. There was a small backpack in the corner with a labubu doll, which was Maya’s. I stepped back, the hallway suddenly too long, the air too thin. I couldn’t breathe.



Unable to process the shock, I turned and went back to the living room. I picked up the garment bag with both hands, opened the door, and walked out.



Inside the elevator, I looked at the reflection of my 23 year old self. Through my pale face, my green eyes stared at me, my blond hair sticking to my face, which was covered with sweat. It was then that I broke down. A sob tore from me making my body shudder. The betrayal was too much to bear. But anger also surged through me, and suddenly I wanted to confront them. How could they do this to me?



So without thinking twice, I went back to his apartment to confront them.



A Video

Bella



I stood in the hallway and tried to breathe, wondering what I was doing? Should I go in? My confidence wavered.



But I wanted to open the door and shout at them, make them face me. I wanted to ask why, since when, and how could they betray me. I wanted to look at Maya and say, “You stole my fiancé.”



My steps faltered because I also knew how Maya was. She would deny everything in front of our father. She would say I was jealous and that I was lying. Just like last time. She would cry like she had done before. Just before leaving home, she played a victim card, making me look like the villain of her life.



But I wanted to ask Craig if any of the last five years meant anything. Gathering courage and wiping my tears, I walked into the apartment.



Just as I reached outside the bedroom, I heard Maya’s soft and smug voice. She said, “You’ve kept it a secret for four years. I’m so proud of you, Craig. You’re awesome! I only wanted to finish college and then marry you. I couldn’t bear to see my stepsister have your kids.”



Craig laughed. “Bella’s a moron,” he said. “She’s so blind in love with me she never notices anything. It was easy to manipulate her.”



Manipulate me? I stood still and held my breath, my tears silently slipping from my eyes once again.



Maya chuckled and spoke again in a sultry voice, “I’m waiting for your divorce. Then we can start our own business. I’ve been dreaming about it for so long!”



Craig sounded pleased. “Of course, love. I’ll divorce Bella in a month. After the wedding, she gets her twenty-million inheritance. And if she divorces within six months, the money goes to her husband. That’s what her grandfather wrote in his will. So, it will all come to us, baby. I only have to tolerate her for a month more.”



I pressed my palm to the wall because I felt like I might fall. My heart pounded in my ears. I knew about my inheritance. Everyone in the family knew that I would get it after marriage and lose it if I divorced within six months.



Maya chuckled. “You're smart, Craig Jones. Gosh, I hate seeing her face. She walks around the house like she owns everything. The bitch doesn’t know how fast her world is going to crumble. Then I will exact my revenge. After she loses her inheritance, her father will remove her from his will also,” she snickered.



Craig laughed hard. “You’re wicked, Maya. Just be patient for a few more weeks, baby. Then we will have it all!”



They had planned my downfall carefully for so long. If I confronted them, it would be the most foolish thing to do.



“Come, ride me, baby!” Craig said. “Let’s celebrate!”



Anger inside me erupted like a volcano. Celebrate my downfall? I wanted to teach them a lesson now. So I took out my phone, and started recording them. If I sent this video to my father, I was sure he would call off the marriage.



“Oh baby, you’re so good!” Craig said as Maya moved on him.



My hand shook so hard in anger that a few seconds later, my phone slipped down. Craig snapped his head toward me. “Bella!” he gasped, his eyes going wide.



Maya also turned sharply to see me, and her mouth dropped open. “Shit!”



I picked up the phone and rushed out.



Craig removed Maya from him and came after me. “Bella, Bella!”



“I don’t want to hear a thing from you!” I shouted, as I scrambled to send the video to Daddy.



“Stop!” he shouted. “Don’t!”



I opened the door. “You both deserve to be exposed!”



“Stop this bullshit, Bella!” he roared. “No one will marry you except me! Your marriage with me is written in stone!”



“I’d rather die than marry you, cheater!” I shouted back through my tears. I pressed the button to send the video to my father.



Craig came after me. But I was out of the door by then. He stood naked on the door of his apartment, watching me leave. “Bellaaaa!” he roared. A few people came out of their apartments hearing the commotion. Good. They would see him naked, dripping in her juices.



I left the apartment building as fast as I could, and went to my car. On the road, the city lights blurred a little. I blinked, trying to clear my vision. My mind played back the words I had just heard. ‘It was a secret for five years’. ‘Divorce in a month’. ‘Twenty million inheritance gone’. ‘Tolerate her for a month more’. ‘I rubbed my chest as the betrayal hurt deep’.



I gripped the steering wheel. I thought about Lucy and her firmly denying me to meet Craig. Did she know? Was she helping them keep me away so I would not see anything? So that their plan was executed smoothly?



Then I thought about my father. If I called him now and told him what I saw, what I heard, would he believe me? No, he wouldn’t. That’s why I sent the video proof. He loved me, but he thought I was an “entitled brat.”



If I hadn’t recorded them in the act, Maya would lie through her teeth in front of him just to get the money. I didn’t trust Craig either. He would rather watch me suffer and make the marriage more miserable.



I remembered how four years ago, after high school, Maya left the house after a fight. She told everyone I was the reason. The house was full of tension for weeks. My father chose to calm Lucy and Maya instead of me. But despite his efforts, Maya left never to return. Since then, Daddy treated me like I might start another problem at any moment. He watched me like I was a risk to manage. He scolded me often because of Maya.



I remembered that fight like it happened yesterday. Maya had cried so much that day, her sobs filled every corner of the house. She stood in front of my father and her mother, acting like she was the victim. She said she would always be a stepsister and that I could never accept her. Then, with a trembling voice, she offered to leave the house so I could live “comfortably.” Lucy’s eyes had filled with tears, but she didn’t protest. She only lowered her head and suffered quietly, as if Maya’s sacrifice was breaking her heart.



But the truth was different. The fight started because on the last day of our school, I had caught Maya with Luke. I had confessed to her a week before that I liked Luke.



I had seen her sitting close to him, cuddling him, kissing him on his lips. When I confronted her later, she smiled in a way she wasn’t ashamed. On the contrary, she flaunted her “victory”. “He never liked you!” she had said, flicking her hair.



The betrayal from Luke was nothing compared to the one from Maya. “You can have him,” I replied.



I stifled my feelings for Luke right after so that Maya could be with him. But I don’t know why Maya came home and created the drama, accusing me of just the opposite? She told our parents that it was me who kissed her boyfriend, Luke, and I hated her for being happy. My father believed her and scolded me to be more adjusting. But Maya left for college nonetheless, trapping me into guilt all this while.



It was during that painful time that Craig, Luke’s friend, stepped in. He comforted me, chased after me, and slowly, I fell in love with him. But now Maya had her claws in Craig as well. It was like she wanted to snatch everything I cherished.



You'll Be Safe

Bella



I didn’t know where to go after leaving Craig’s apartment. My chest still hurt deep from the betrayal, and my thoughts kept circling the same question—how could Maya do this to me again?



Before I knew it, I was parking in front of the Phoenix Mall, the largest and grandest mall in the city. It had chains across the world, and I had heard that its CEO, Scott Moore, was a secretive sharp billionaire bachelor. He was arrogant, and cold, more handsome than God, and had hundreds of girls swooning over him.



I wandered through the bright halls of the mall and walked into a quiet café. The smell of coffee and baked bread wafted in the air. I ordered a cappuccino and sat at a small table by the window. The moment the cup was in my hands, tears started to fall again. I tried to wipe them quickly, but they kept coming. I cried quietly, hoping no one noticed. I couldn’t believe my life had come to this. How was I supposed to stop a marriage my whole family had already planned? Would my father believe the video content? I wondered if I should make the video viral.



Just as I lowered my head to sip my coffee, the door opened, and two men walked in. My heart skipped. It was Luke and Mark, Craig’s friends. Luke was the same boy who I liked in high school before Maya destroyed it all. I quickly bent my head lower, hoping they wouldn’t notice me. They sat two tables behind me, talking and laughing. I couldn’t help but overhear them.



“Bella has always been a moron,” Luke chuckled, stirring his coffee. “She never noticed Craig and Maya were in love. Stupid blind brat. Maya is back in town and she'll be staying with me for a while.”



Mark laughed loudly. “But it works for us, Luke. Craig smartly handled Bella after you goofed up with her. Once he gets Bella’s inheritance, we’re set. Our contracts with him are already drafted. The moment the money comes, we’ll sign. Our businesses will finally take off. Only a month before final goodbye to the bitch!” They both laughed again.



My blood went cold. I clutched my cup so tightly I thought it might break. Their words sank in slowly but clearly. They were all in on it. Craig, Maya, Luke, and Mark. They weren’t just betraying me with love. They were plotting around my inheritance. My stomach twisted, bitterness coating my soul. This all was happening behind my back ever since high school, and like a fool, I never came to know. How gullible I was?



Anger burned in my chest. I wanted to go to their table and confront them, scream that I had come to know it all. On an impulse, I pushed my chair back and stood up quickly. But the moment I turned, I collided with someone. Arms gripped me instantly to stop me from falling.



I craned my neck up, and for a moment, I forgot how to breathe. A beautiful man, towering over me with broad shoulders, filled the space. He was wearing a pinstripe suit. His face was striking with a sharp jawline, high cheekbones, and dark eyes so intense they seemed to glow. His lips were firm and bow-shaped, his nose straight, his black hair falling just slightly across his forehead. He looked unreal, like a man who didn’t belong to this world. Like a king who ruled the world.



I noticed that there was complete silence in the café now. In that instant, an idea lit up in my mind. A reckless, desperate plan that could actually break the marriage.



I tilted my head slightly, giving Luke and Mark a sidelong glance, then turned back to the man. Without giving myself time to think, I pressed my lips against his.



He growled low in his throat as his hand shot out and grabbed me by the waist, pulling me close. It was protective, possessive, and startling all at once. My body went stiff in his arms, but from the corner of my eyes, I saw Luke and Mark watching us. Their mouths had fallen open. Everyone in the café had turned to stare.



The kiss was quick at first, just enough for everyone to see. I whispered against his lips, “Please, could you keep up the act for a minute?”



To my surprise, he didn’t push me away. Instead, his hand tightened on my waist, and he kissed me back. His lips were warm and commanding. He deepened the kiss, and the world around me blurred. His kiss was passionate, strong, almost overwhelming. For a moment, I forgot why I even started it. I felt my knees weaken, and I had to hold on to his shirt to stay steady.



When we finally broke apart, the café was completely silent. My lips tingled, my cheeks burned, and I couldn’t get a hold of myself. Like my whole body was on fire. 



But I knew Luke and Mark had seen everything. Now they would inform Craig or my father about it. So if the video didn’t work, this would.



“Could you please walk out with me from the café?” I asked softly. “I want them to see it clearly,” I said, darting my eyes to Luke and Mark.



“Do you want me to make them disappear from the face of the earth?” he asked seriously, his intense eyes locked on mine.



My mouth dropped. Was he a mafia boss? I let out a nervous chuckle. “N-no!”



Without waiting, he grabbed my wrist and walked with me toward the door. I glanced back. Luke and Mark had jumped up, chasing us. Panic rushed through me. I pulled closer to the man and whispered urgently, “Please, help me. Hide me for a few hours. I want to escape them.” Now I was afraid that they would confront me and manhandle me.



His dark eyes cut to me. “You shouldn’t trust strangers,” he said in a low and rough voice.



I faltered, my lips parting. I didn’t know what to say. I felt foolish and desperate. But then his eyes softened. “But I’ll save you,” he said.



Something in me believed him instantly. I couldn’t explain why. It was pure instinct.



He led me quickly to a side hallway I hadn’t even noticed before. At the end was a private elevator, hidden behind mirrored doors. He pressed his palm to a panel, and the doors opened silently. I glanced behind. Luke and Mark were still chasing, and they were closing in.



The man pulled me inside with him, still holding my wrist. The doors closed, shutting out the noise, and shutting out everything. My heart pounded in my chest as the elevator began to rise.



“Where are we going?” I whispered, half afraid of the answer.



He turned his head slightly, his eyes burning into mine. “To my penthouse,” he said. “You’ll be safe there.”



Somehow, even with everything I had been through that day, I believed him. Maybe I had a natural penchant for falling into wrong hands.



Mate

Scott



For centuries, the Lycans had ruled the werewolf race. They were stronger, faster, and nearly immortal, and were born kings. But time had not been kind. Wars, disease, and betrayal had cut their numbers until only I remained. I was the last Lycan alive, and I was the last Lycan king of the werewolves. At 28, the weight of my kind rested on my shoulders.



In order to survive, we moved into human cities and learned to live among them, blending into their world because we had no choice. We worked like them, dressed like them, and hid our true selves. To the humans, I was only Scott Moore, the young billionaire who owned the chain of Phoenix Malls and countless other businesses. If our true identities were discovered, it would mean the end of us.



Every year, Lycans went into a frenzy to rut for a week in order to mate. And it was that time of the year for me. I wanted to fuck every she-wolf or human I came in contact with, but I was restraining myself. I took heavy medication to stop my desires and lust.



And the Elders never let me forget my duty especially during this time. They said it was time I took a mate and produced heirs. They told me every day that my bloodline was too important to end with me, and that without me the werewolves would die out. It was me who gave them the power to exist. They wanted me to continue the Lycan line. But they didn’t understand the risk. Being a Lycan was different from being a normal werewolf. My power was stronger, heavier. If a female she-wolf carried my pup, she might not survive the birth.



Still, the Elders pushed me. “There are plenty of willing she-wolves,” they said. “They would give their lives for you.” They called it sacrifice. I called it madness. I wasn’t going to kill someone just to satisfy their demand. So I refused, again and again. I didn’t want an heir if it meant killing someone to get it.



This discussion again took place in the early morning meeting today. I pinched the bridge of my nose as I listened to them, waiting impatiently to get out of the meeting. As soon as it was done, I walked out of the room, and went for a swim to spend my energy and calm my anger and lust. I had an important meeting with human shareholders to attend next.



Thirty minutes later, I reached that meeting with my Beta, Troy. Troy explained a new plan to the shareholders about dividends. I sat at the head of the table, listening intently, when suddenly a scent hit me. It was that of sweet and warm chocolate and cinnamon. The smell was so strong it shook me. My Lycan stirred instantly. How could a chocolate cake smell so good? My throat went dry and my chest tightened. I couldn’t help the urge to eat it right away.



I tried to sit still, but the craving grew stronger with every second. My hands clenched on the table. What the hell was happening with me? The smell was pulling me like a chain.



I pushed back my chair and stood abruptly. Without a word, I left the meeting. Troy scrambled to follow. “Scott, what’s going on?” he asked as every shareholder looked at me with surprise.



I didn’t answer as I strode out of the meeting. The mouthwatering scent filled my lungs, guiding me through the corridors of Phoenix Mall. My Lycan was in full control now. I felt like a predator on the hunt. And that too for a chocolate and cinnamon cake? I loved dark chocolates, but this? My reaction was strange.



The trail led me to a quiet café. The smell was strong here. I opened the door and walked to the counter, scanning the cakes that got me so distracted. The girl behind the counter flustered, and blushed. It was a normal reaction of humans when they saw me. I continued to scan the cakes, and that’s when I heard a soft sniffle. I snapped my head in that direction.

1pgcc6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_The-Solo-Backpacker/comments/1pgcc6z/your_complete_backpacking_preparation_checklist/,Your Complete Backpacking Preparation Checklist,"When I first started backpacking, I learned fast that preparation is everything. You can’t just throw a few things in a bag and hope the weather, terrain, and your body all cooperate.

A well-planned trip is the difference between “that was incredible” and “never again.”

Over time, I stopped thinking of preparation as a random packing list and started treating it as a system. That system eventually became The Backpacker’s Ten—ten pillars that cover how you think, what you carry, and how you adapt when the wild doesn’t match the forecast.

This checklist walks through those pillars in plain language so you can pack smart, build margin, and head into the backcountry with a lot less guesswork..



# Essential Gear for Every Backpacking Trip

The foundation of any successful trip is your core gear system. You want to carry **enough** to handle bad weather and small failures, without hauling a miserable, overloaded pack.

Think in terms of jobs your gear must do: **shelter, warmth, water, food, fire, tools, navigation, first aid, and communication.**



**Backpack (Loadout & Gear Security)**

* 40–75 liters for most overnight to multi-day trips.
* Sized to your torso with a solid hip belt and padded shoulder straps.
* Try it fully loaded before your trip, not in the parking lot.



**Shelter & Sleep (Shelter & Insulation)**

* **Tent, tarp, or hammock system** suited to season and terrain.
* **Sleeping bag or quilt** rated at least 10–15°F colder than the forecast low.
* **Sleeping pad** with enough R-value for the conditions (and no slow leaks).



**Clothing System (Shelter & Insulation)**

* Moisture-wicking **base layers** (synthetic or merino).
* An **insulating layer** (fleece or puffy jacket).
* A **waterproof, breathable shell** jacket (and pants if conditions call for it).
* Hiking pants/shorts, warm hat, lightweight gloves, and extra socks.



**Water & Treatment (Water & Purification)**

* Capacity for **2–4 liters** depending on route and conditions.
* Water filter, purifier bottle, or treatment drops/tablets.
* At least one bottle that’s easy to fill from shallow or slow-moving water.



**Food & Cooking (Food & Fuel)**

* Lightweight, calorie-dense meals (freeze-dried, instant rice/pasta, oats).
* Snacks: trail mix, nuts, jerky, energy bars, dried fruit.
* Compact stove, matching fuel, lighter + backup fire starter, small pot, spoon/spork.



**Light & Fire (Fire & Light)**

* Headlamp with fresh batteries.
* Backup: extra battery or small second light.
* Two fire-starting methods (lighter + matches or fire steel + tinder).



**Tools & Repairs (Tools & Repairs)**

* Multi-tool or knife.
* Small repair kit: tape (Tenacious/duct), needle and thread, pad patches, a couple of zip ties, spare cord/guyline.



**First Aid & Hygiene (First Aid & Hygiene)**

* Blister care (tape, blister pads).
* Bandages, gauze, antiseptic wipes.
* Pain relief and any personal medications.
* Hand sanitizer, toothbrush, small toothpaste, TP/trowel and pack-out bags where needed.



**Navigation & Communication (Navigation & Orientation + Communication & Signaling)**

* Map of your route and a compass you know how to use.
* GPS or phone with **offline maps** in a waterproof bag or case.
* Whistle on your shoulder strap.
* Optional but wise: satellite messenger for no-service areas.



Packing these essentials makes you ready for most normal problems the backcountry will throw at you, instead of relying on luck and perfect conditions.

  
Backpacking Preparation Checklist: Organizing Your Pack

Once you have the right gear, **how you pack it** matters almost as much as what you bring. Smart organization keeps your load balanced and your critical gear accessible when you actually need it.



**Build a Solid Load Core**

* Place **heavier items** (food bag, water, shelter) close to your back and centered vertically.
* Surround them with medium-weight items (stove, cook kit, clothing).
* Use light, compressible items (sleeping bag, puffy) to fill gaps and keep things from shifting.



**Use Simple Organization Tools**

* Dry bags or a pack liner to keep insulation and clothes dry.
* Stuff sacks or packing cubes for categories like clothing, first aid, and toiletries.
* A dedicated, easy-to-grab pouch for repair and first aid items.



**Make Critical Gear Instantly Reachable**

* Hip belt pockets / top lid / side pockets:
   * Snacks
   * Map and compass
   * Headlamp
   * Water and/or filter
   * Rain jacket
* Avoid burying essential items at the bottom of your pack “just for the hike in.” That’s when you end up soaked, hungry, or fumbling in the dark.



**Protect the Vulnerable Stuff**

* Electronics and paper maps in waterproof bags.
* Stove fuel stored upright and away from sharp objects.
* Sharp gear (stakes, tools) stored where they won’t puncture your pad or liner.



**Test and Adjust Before You Go**

* Load the pack as if you’re leaving for the trip.
* Walk around the neighborhood or a local trail for at least an hour:
   * Adjust shoulder straps, hip belt, and load lifters.
   * Note any hot spots, odd pressure points, or annoying flopping items.



This is where **Loadout & Gear Security** lives in The Backpacker’s Ten: everything has a home, critical items are protected, and nothing vital gets left behind on a log at a lunch spot.

# Clothing and Footwear: What to Wear and Pack

Clothing is part of your **shelter system**, not just a style choice. The goal is to stay warm, dry, and able to adapt as the weather changes.



**Layering System**

* **Base Layer (Next-to-Skin)**
   * Synthetic or merino top and bottom.
   * Wicks sweat, dries fast, and doesn’t turn icy like cotton.
* **Insulation Layer**
   * Fleece or lightweight down/synthetic puffy.
   * Worn in camp, on breaks, and during cold starts.
* **Shell Layer (Weather Armor)**
   * Waterproof, breathable rain jacket; rain pants if conditions warrant.
   * Cuts wind, sheds rain, and helps your insulation actually work.
* **Hiking Layer**
   * Lightweight hiking pants or shorts (convertible pants are handy in wild temps).
   * Sun hat or cap; buff or beanie for cold.



**Socks and Foot Care**

* 2–3 pairs of **wool or synthetic hiking socks**.
* 1 dedicated pair of **sleep-only socks** you never hike in.
* Optional but helpful: thin liner socks if you tend to blister.



**Footwear**

* Hiking boots or trail runners that are already broken in.
* Enough grip for your terrain (mud, rock, roots).
* Insoles if you need extra support.



Avoid cotton for anything that matters: it holds moisture and chills you when the temperature drops. Think of your clothing as a flexible insulation system you can adjust all day, not a bulky pile of “just in case” items.



# Food and Water: Staying Fueled and Hydrated

Without enough food and water, your plan, your gear, and your mindset all start to fall apart. This is where **Food & Fuel** and **Water & Purification** show up in the real world.  


**Plan Simple, High-Energy Meals**

* Breakfasts: instant oatmeal, granola, breakfast bars, coffee/tea if you like.
* Dinners: freeze-dried meals, ramen with add-ins, instant rice or pasta sides.
* Snacks: trail mix, nuts, jerky, nut butters, energy bars, dried fruit.



Aim for foods that are:

* Lightweight
* Calorie-dense
* Easy to cook (or no-cook) when you’re tired and cold.



Pack enough for each day **plus at least one extra meal** in case of delays.



**Dial In Your Water Plan**

* Know where water sources are **before** you leave (map/guide/app).
* Carry enough capacity to comfortably reach the next **known** source.



A simple rule I use:

>Don’t leave a water source until you know where your next one is *and* you’re carrying more than enough to get there—even if that next source is dry and you have to turn back.



**Treatment and Backup**

* Primary: filter, purifier bottle, or UV device you know how to use.
* Backup: tablets/drops or the ability to boil.
* Keep treatment where it’s easy to grab at every stop.



**Hydration Habits**

* Sip regularly instead of chugging once you’re very thirsty.
* Add electrolytes on hot days, steep climbs, or when you’re sweating hard.

Good food and a solid water plan protect your energy, your decision-making, and your morale when the miles start to compound.

# Safety and Navigation: Staying on Track and Secure

This is where several pillars overlap: **Mindset & Strategy, Navigation & Orientation, First Aid & Hygiene, and Communication & Signaling**. The goal is to stay found, stay calm, and handle problems before they turn into emergencies.



**Navigation Basics**

* Carry a **paper map** of your route and a **compass**—and know at least the basics of using them together.
* Use GPS or a phone with **offline maps** as a powerful tool, not your only plan.
* Check your location regularly instead of waiting until you feel lost.



If something feels off:

1. Stop
2. Breathe
3. Look at your map and surroundings
4. Decide your next move with a cool head, not panic



**Trip Plan and Check-In**

* Tell someone you trust:
   * Where you’re going
   * Your general route and camps
   * When you plan to return
   * When they should start to worry and what to do if you’re overdue



This simple step is one of the most important “safety devices” you can have.



**Emergency Communication and Signaling**

* Whistle on your shoulder strap (3 blasts is a common distress signal).
* Signal mirror or bright cloth to attract attention.
* Satellite messenger or PLB if you spend time out of cell service.



Have a personal rule like:

>If I’m injured and getting worse, or truly lost and not improving the situation after a set amount of time, I call for help instead of hoping it magically gets better.



**First Aid & Basic Skills**

* Carry a small, focused first aid kit that fits *you* and your trips.
* Learn how to:
   * Treat blisters before they become show-stoppers
   * Clean and bandage cuts
   * Manage minor sprains and strains
* Keep a small card with emergency contacts and any important medical info.



Staying safe on the trail isn’t about fear—it’s about building enough margin that you can handle normal problems without spinning into crisis mode.



# Final Tips for a Successful Backpacking Trip

There are a few things that don’t fit neatly into a gear list but matter just as much. This is where the **Mindset & Strategy**pillar really ties everything together.



**Test Your System Before the Trip**

* Use your tent, stove, filter, and sleep system at least once.
* Do a short shakedown hike with your full pack.
* Fix problems at home, not after mile 7 in the rain.



**Build Margin, Not Just Miles**

* Choose routes that match your current fitness, not your dream version of yourself.
* Add buffer: extra time, extra warmth, and a little extra food.
* Have at least one bailout option you’re genuinely willing to use.



**Pack Light, But Not Reckless**

* Cut true duplicates and “just in case” items you never use.
* Keep redundancy where it matters: navigation, fire, water treatment, and light.



**Leave No Trace**

* Protect the places you love so you can come back—and so others can experience them.
* Follow local rules for campfires, campsites, and waste.



**Keep Your Head in the Right Place**

* Expect small problems: wet socks, rough climbs, changing plans.
* Treat them as part of the adventure, not proof you “failed” at planning.
* The goal isn’t perfection—it’s resilience.



If you want to go deeper than a single backpacking checklist and really learn the system behind it, my [**Backpacker’s Ten**](https://amzn.to/4rFJRkq) book and [**Strategic Wilderness Foundations**](https://www.the-solo-backpacker.com/tb10swbc) online course walk through each pillar in more detail—mindset, shelter, water, food, navigation, first aid, communication, tools, and loadout—with real trip examples and printable tools you can use on every adventure.



With the right preparation, your backpacking trips won’t depend on perfect weather or good luck. You’ll have a clear way to *plan, prepare, and prevail*—and the wild becomes a place you can step into with confidence, not hesitation.

I’ve realised something after a few years in tech — I can debug production issues at 2 AM, but I absolutely cannot figure out how people move from “hi” to “okay we’re dating now” in real life.

I’m 24, developer, Bangalore-based. My daily routine is mostly: code, meetings, coffee, more code, existential thoughts, sleep. Rinse. Repeat. Social life exists, but it’s mostly memes on WhatsApp and the rare plan that actually survives till Sunday.

I did try dating apps for a while. Let’s just say my consistency there matches my gym motivation — strong for a week, questionable after that. A few conversations started well, then slowly died like side projects.

Sometimes I wonder if devs are just playing dating on hard mode because:
- Our “natural habitat” is laptops and headphones
- Most of our hobbies are… also indoor
- And half our flirting skills are borrowed from Stack Overflow comments

So I’m genuinely curious:
- How are people in tech actually meeting someone these days?
- Does it happen through work, hobbies, friends, or pure random luck?
- And be honest — is everyone else also low-key confused, or is it just me?

Madison



I lifted my gaze from the computer screen as the elevator dinged. A woman in a red dress strutted toward me, her heels clicking against the marble floor like a timer counting down to chaos.



""I'm here to see Alexander."" She planted her manicured hands on my desk, leaning forward with a smile that didn't reach her eyes.



""Do you have an appointment?""



""I don't need one. We have... history. Just tell Shim Vanessa's here.""



""I'm sorry, but Mr. Knight only takes scheduled appointments. I can help you set one up for next week-""



""Listen here, little secretary."" She interrupted. ""I'm Vanessa Caldwell. I spent the night with Alexander last weekend, and I'm not leaving until I see him.""



""As I mentioned, without an appointment or express permission from Mr. Knight-""



""Who do you think you are? Just because you stand next to him all day, fetching his coffee and taking notes, you think you're special?""



""Ma'am, I need to ask you to leave-""



""You're pathetic. Playing gatekeeper, pretending you matter. I bet you fantasize about him noticing you, don't you? Honey, even if you spread those thighs on his desk, he wouldn't give you a second glance. He needs a real woman, not some desperate little assistant playing dress-up in her Target blazer.""



""Security will escort you out if necessary.""



""You wouldn't dare. Do you know who my father is? I could have your job with one phone call.""



""And I could remove you from the premises with one button."" I placed my hand near the security alert under my desk. ""Your choice, Ms. Caldwell.""



Vanessa's face contorted with rage. In one fluid motion, she snatched the water pitcher from my desk and emptied its contents over my head. Ice-cold water drenched my hair, makeup, and brand-new blouse – for the record, it wasn't from Target.



""Oops."" She smirked, dropping the empty pitcher on my keyboard with a clatter. ""Looks like someone needs a towel.""



But before I could process my next move, the elevator dinged again.



Alexander Knight stepped out, filling the lobby like a storm front. His easy stride faltered as he took in the scene - me looking like a drowned rat, Vanessa preening like a cat who'd gotten the cream, and water pooling across my desk and expensive electronics.



""Well."" His voice cut through the tension. ""This is certainly not the greeting I expected.""



Vanessa's face lit up. ""Alexander, darling! I was just-""



""Assaulting my PA and damaging company property?"" He crossed to us in three strides. ""Bold strategy.""



""I was simply having a conversation with your PA."" Her voice dripped honey while her eyes stabbed mine. ""She refused to let me see you.""



""Because that's her job."" Alexander handed me his monogrammed handkerchief. His touch sent an unwanted tingle up my arm. ""Miss Harper follows my protocols to the letter. That's why she's invaluable.""



I dabbed at my face, grateful I'd worn waterproof mascara today. The handkerchief smelled like his cologne – a detail I wasn't focusing on.



""But darling,"" Vanessa stepped closer to Alexander, her hip swaying. ""After our magical night together-""



""You mean the charity gala where you had too much champagne, and I called you a cab? That was hardly magical, though I hear you've been telling a different version around town.""



I bit my lip to hide my smile.



""I-"" Vanessa gaped like a fish.



""Now,"" Alexander's hand came to rest on my shoulder, and I prayed he couldn't feel how my pulse jumped. ""You've just assaulted my favorite employee and probably destroyed about ten thousand dollars worth of equipment. Would you like me to call security or the cops?""



I felt my cheeks heat at my 'favorite employee.' He was always like this—charming, flirtatious, and making everyone feel special. It didn't mean anything.



""You wouldn't dare."" But Vanessa's confidence wavered.



""Try me. I protect my people, especially those who keep my life running smoothly. In fact, I should ban you from the building entirely. What do you think, Miss Harper?""



""I think that sounds reasonable, Mr. Knight."" I stayed professional despite his touch warming me.



Vanessa's face cycled through fifty shades of red. ""This is ridiculous. You'll regret this. Both of you will.""



""The only thing I regret is not having my phone out to record this tantrum. Security's on their way up. I suggest you leave before they arrive.""



""My father will hear about this!""



""I'm sure he will. Give Charles my regards. Tell him his company's stock is looking shaky these days.""



As soon as the elevator doors closed on her scowling face, Alexander's hand left my shoulder, and I immediately missed its warmth – a thought I quickly shoved into my brain's 'do not examine' folder.



I stood from my chair, water dripping onto the floor.



""Are you alright?"" Alexander's brow furrowed as he assessed the damage. ""She didn't hurt you, did she?""



""Just my pride. And maybe my electronics."" I poked at my waterlogged keyboard, which responded with an alarming spark.



""Leave that. I'll have IT bring up replacements."" He pulled out his phone. ""John can get you to the mall in fifteen minutes. Use the company card to pick up whatever you need—clothes, makeup, hair products.""



""Thank you, Mr. Knight, but it's no big deal. My shift ends in an hour, and I have a prior engagement after work.""



""You're going to sit in wet clothes for another hour?""



""I'll manage,"" I insisted with a smile. ""But I appreciate the offer.""



He gave me a look that said he didn't believe me but nodded anyway.



I pushed open the door to the restaurant, ready for a relaxing dinner with Hazel after my disaster of a day. The hostess led me toward our usual corner booth, but I stopped short. Instead of just my best friend, a man sat beside her.



""Mads!"" Hazel bounced up, waving like I might miss her in the half-empty restaurant. ""You made it! Come meet Derek!""



I forced a smile and sat across from them. Of course, Hazel would ambush me with a surprise blind date after the day I'd had.



""Mads, this is Derek. He's a financial analyst, and I met him at that yoga retreat last month."" Hazel's eyes sparkled with matchmaking glee. ""Derek, meet my best friend Madison.""



""Pleasure."" Derek flashed perfectly whitened teeth. ""Hazel told me so much about you.""



I resisted the urge to kick Hazel under the table. ""All good things, I hope?""



We fumbled through awkward small talk about the weather and restaurant specials until Derek excused himself to the restroom.



The moment he was out of earshot, Hazel pounced. ""Isn't he dreamy? Those shoulders! And he's so successful - you should see his condo downtown.""



""Haze...""



""Come on, when did you last go on a real date? You work too hard, sweetie. Everyone needs someone to lean on.""



""I'm fine on my own right now. With Mom's treatments and everything...""



""How is she doing?"" Hazel's expression softened.



""The same. The new medication is expensive, but..."" I shrugged.



""And that brother of yours is still MIA?"" Hazel's face darkened. ""What a selfish asshole, leaving you to handle everything alone.""



""I don't want to talk about him. Mom worked three jobs to raise us. The least I can do is help her now.""



Derek slid back into the booth, adjusting his designer tie. ""Sorry about that. Now, where were we?""



""Madison was just telling us about her day at work,"" Hazel chirped.



""Oh, right - you work as a secretary or something?"" Derek asked.



""Personal assistant to Alexander Knight at Knight Industries.""



""Alexander Knight? The CEO?"" He leaned forward, elbows on the table. ""Must be quite the... demanding position.""



""Excuse me?""



""Come on, we all know how these things work."" He winked. ""Beautiful young woman, powerful executive—I'm sure you've found ways to make yourself invaluable to the company.""



Hazel's jaw dropped. ""Derek!""



""What? I'm just saying what everyone thinks when they see these arrangements."" He gestured vaguely at me. ""No judgment here. A girl's got to use her assets.""



""You absolute pig."" Hazel's face flushed red. ""Get out.""



""Hey, I'm just being honest. No need to get defensive-""



""Out!"" Hazel stood up, pointing toward the door. ""Now.""



""Alright, alright. Guess some people can't handle the truth."" He slid out of the booth, adjusting his jacket. ""Call me when you're ready to be real about things.""



We watched him weave between tables toward the exit. Hazel collapsed back into her seat, mortified.



""Oh my god, Mads. I am so, so sorry. I can't believe I thought he was decent. He seemed so nice at yoga!""



""Hey, at least we found out he was trash before the appetizers arrived."" I grabbed the menu, determined to salvage our evening. ""Now, about those loaded nachos we always get...""



""But still! The things he said about you and Mr. Knight!"" She shook her head. ""I feel awful.""



""Forget him. Seriously."" I waved down a waiter. ""The nachos and two margaritas, please. Make mine a double.""



Hazel brightened with mischief. ""Although, maybe Derek had a point. Not about you being - you know - but about Mr. Knight liking you. I've seen the way he looks at you.""



I choked on my water, sputtering. ""What? No! That's - that's impossible. He's my boss!""



""Why not? You're smart, gorgeous, and he's clearly interested.""



""Stop it!"" I grabbed a napkin to wipe my chin. ""It's not like that at all.""



Hazel burst out laughing. ""Relax, I'm kidding! Everyone knows Alexander Knight is Manhattan's most notorious playboy. Different supermodels every week, yacht parties in Monaco."" She leaned forward. ""Just be careful, okay? Don't let that pretty face and charm fool you. Men like him don't do relationships - they collect trophies.""



""Trust me, I know exactly who he is."" My phone buzzed.



I pulled out my phone to check the message. Alexander's name flashed on the screen.



""325 Park Avenue, Penthouse. Come now.""



No explanation, no context. Typical Alexander.



""Everything okay?"" Hazel peered across the table.



""Work."" I grabbed my purse, already sliding out of the booth. ""Rain check on those nachos?""



""Again? This is getting ridiculous. It's almost 8 PM!""



""I know, I know. But-""



""But nothing! You're not his personal servant. You have a life, too. What could possibly be so urgent?""



""It's probably another last-minute networking event. He does this sometimes—invites potential investors over for drinks. Someone has to coordinate with catering and handle the guest list.""



""And that someone always has to be you?""



""It's my job.""



""Your job ended three hours ago."" Hazel's voice softened. ""I worry about you, you know?""



""I know you worry. But this job - the benefits, the salary - it's helping Mom fight. I can't risk losing it.""



""Just be careful, okay?""



I nodded, already halfway to the door. The cool night air hit my face as I flagged down a cab.



The cab wound through Manhattan's glittering streets. Mom's medical bills haunted me, mounting higher each month. I couldn't mess this up. Not when she needed me.



325 Park Avenue loomed ahead, all gleaming glass and steel stretching into the night sky. The doorman nodded as I crossed the marble lobby to the private elevator. My finger hesitated over the penthouse button. Something felt... off.



Usually, when Alexander hosted impromptu gatherings, the lobby buzzed with activity—caterers rushing supplies, guests arriving in designer suits and cocktail dresses. Tonight, there was silence.



My heels clicked against the marble floor as I stepped out, echoing through the empty space. Warm lighting spilled across modern furniture and floor-to-ceiling windows, showcasing the city's sparkle below.



""Mr. Knight?""



No response. Just the soft whir of the central air.



The hair on my neck stood up. Something definitely wasn't right.



A floorboard creaked behind me.



I spun around, heart hammering. Alexander stood there, leaning casually against the doorframe.



He stepped forward, closing the distance between us in three long strides. Before I could react, he had me cornered against the wall, one hand braced beside my head.



Chapter 2

Madison



His presence was intoxicating. Alexander's cologne wrapped around me, lingering like dark spices and something earthy. My pulse quickened as he leaned in, our faces just inches apart.



""You're here,"" he murmured.



""Mr. Knight, what's going on?"" My voice trembled. I placed a hand on his chest, meaning to push him back, but all I felt was the chiseled muscles under his shirt.



He took my hand, interlacing his fingers with mine and pressing it back against the wall. The heat from his touch was electric, coursing straight to my core. My breathing turned shallow, and my heart thudded in my ears. His eyes were dark, pupils blown wide.



""You're really here."" He whispered huskily. His gaze swept my face, lingering on my lips as his breath warmed my cheek.



""Are you... okay?"" I stammered. His pupils seemed larger than normal, almost swallowing the blue of his irises. Something felt off. Was he on drugs?



""I'm more than okay."" He nuzzled against my neck, lips brushing my skin. ""You're perfect.""



""I think you might need medical assistance—""



He didn't let me finish. His mouth captured mine, and the world tilted on its axis. The kiss was fierce, desperate, and filled with a hunger that took my breath away. His free hand found my waist, pulling me against him. Hard. Unyielding.



The sensible part of my brain screamed for me to push him away, to get help. But then his tongue parted my lips, and my knees went weak. I grabbed onto his shoulders to steady myself, my fingers digging into the fine fabric of his suit.



His kiss grew more intense, leaving me scarcely able to think or breathe. As our tongues entwined, a moan escaped my lips—one I wouldn't have admitted to if questioned.



My hands roamed over his shoulders and back, feeling the hard muscles flex beneath my touch. His grip on my waist tightened, lifting me effortlessly.



Before I knew it, he maneuvered me backward, guiding me toward the bedroom. We stumbled, our lips never parting, until the back of my knees hit the king-sized bed. He gently pushed me onto the mattress, positioning himself above me. His eyes were wild, hungry.



""Off,"" he growled, tugging at my blouse impatiently.



I fumbled with the buttons, my fingers clumsy in their eagerness. Finally, I managed to undo the fabric and slip out of it, my breasts spilling out, my lacy bra doing little to contain them.



His gaze darkened, and he yanked the bra cups down, exposing my hardened nipples to the cool air.



He bent down, taking one nipple into his mouth, sucking hard. I arched up, gasping as his teeth grazed me. His free hand roamed lower, slipping under the waistband of my pants. The moment he found my clit through the thin fabric of my panties, a sharp jolt shot through me.



""Fuck,"" I moaned, my fingers threading through his hair, holding him to my chest.



With one swift motion, he tugged my pants and panties down my legs. The cool air hit my wet pussy, making me shiver. His hands spread my thighs apart, his fingers slipping into my wet heat, pressing inside me. I cried out, hips bucking against his hand.



""You're so fucking wet already,"" he muttered, almost to himself. ""I could take you right here.""



Before I could respond, his fingers withdrew, leaving me aching. I watched, breathless, as he quickly moved to unbuckle his belt and unzip his pants. He didn't bother removing his clothes, but his massive, rock-hard cock sprang free, and my eyes widened at the sight.



He climbed between my legs, positioning the head of his cock at my entrance, teasing me with its thickness. I squirmed, my body screaming for him to fill me.



He thrust into me hard and fast, sheathing himself fully in one brutal stroke. The initial stretch had me seeing stars, but soon, pleasure overwhelmed everything. His cock filled me completely, hitting spots I didn't know existed.



My nails dug into his back as he set a punishing rhythm, each thrust sending waves of ecstasy crashing through me.



His mouth crashed against mine in a desperate, bruising kiss. His hands gripped my hips hard as he pounded into me. Our bodies collided with slick sounds, mingling with our groans and panting breaths.



""God, you're so tight,"" he growled, breath hot and ragged. ""Feels fucking incredible.""



We moved together, our bodies entwined in a primal dance. I felt the pressure building, the peak of my orgasm just within reach. He angled his hips, and the change in depth brought him harder against my G-spot. I cried out, my entire body tensing.



""I'm close, Alexander,"" I gasped, my nails raking down his back.



My voice seemed to spur him on, his movements growing even more frenzied. He thrust into me with a force that had me clutching at the sheets, trying to ground myself against the intense pleasure.



""Yes, fuck, take it all,"" he groaned, his pace becoming erratic. ""Come for me.""



His encouragement drove me over the edge. With a final scream, I shattered, my pussy clenching tight around his cock as waves of orgasm washed over me. I rode out the storm, body convulsing as he continued fucking me through it.



It was then, just as my orgasm began to wane, that I heard him mutter, ""Fuck, Katherine.""



I froze. My mind reeled. Katherine?! Who the hell was Katherine?



But I couldn't dwell on it for long because he was still fucking me, his cock pistoning in and out with savage intensity. My overstimulated body responded despite my confusion, another climax already building.



""Katherine, your pussy is so fucking tight."" He drove into me one last time, spilling inside me with a guttural moan. His body trembled, his release triggering my own. Another orgasm rippled through me, leaving me breathless and shaking.



As the haze of pleasure faded, reality sank in. Alexander had called another woman's name while fucking me. He didn't even know who I was.



As he collapsed next to me on the bed, his breathing heavy, I stared at the ceiling, my mind racing. Who was Katherine? Did she work for him, too, or was she just one of his many conquests? The thought gnawed at me like a persistent itch I couldn't scratch.



I slipped out from under his arm, my legs still trembling. Alexander's soft snores filled the bedroom as I gathered my scattered clothes. Of course, he'd pass out - typical man. At least he hadn't called me ""baby"" or some other generic pet name. No, he'd gone with ""Katherine"" instead.



I stumbled to the bathroom, wincing at my reflection. My carefully straightened hair now resembled a bird's nest, and my lipstick... well, that was definitely not where lipstick should be.



As I cleaned up, my mind wandered to the stack of NDAs in my desk drawer - all the women who'd crossed paths with Alexander Knight.



""At least I didn't have to draft my own NDA,"" I muttered. Being Alexander's PA meant cleaning up his messes and arranging flowers and ""sorry"" gifts for the parade of models and socialites he left in his wake. But Katherine? That name wasn't in any of my files.



I smoothed down my outfit and checked my phone - 10:27 PM. The doctor would still be awake. I scrolled through my contacts, finding Dr. Peterson's number. My thumb hovered over the call button as Alexander's snores echoed from the bedroom.



""Dr. Peterson? Sorry to bother you so late."" I kept my voice steady and professional. Like I hadn't just had mind-blowing sex with my boss. ""It's Madison Harper, Mr. Knight's PA.""



""What's he done now?"" Dr. Peterson sighed.



""He seems altered. Dilated pupils, unusual behavior. I found him like this when I came to drop off some urgent paperwork."" The lie slipped out easily. Too easily.



""Drugs?""



""Possibly. He's sleeping now, but-""



""I'll be there in twenty.""



""Thank you, Doctor."" I ended the call and slipped my phone into my pocket.



Back in the bedroom, Alexander sprawled across the unmade bed like a fallen Greek statue, suit wrinkled and pants still undone.



""Right. Time to make you presentable."" I surveyed the scene. The nightstand had shifted a foot to the left. A decorative vase teetered on the edge – how had we not broken that?



I approached Alexander's sleeping form. ""Don't you dare wake up,"" I muttered, reaching for his zipper. My fingers trembled as I worked quickly to tuck in his shirt and fasten his pants. The belt proved trickier – threading it through the loops while he was dead weight required some creative maneuvering.



His head lolled to the side. ""Mmm... Katherine...""



I yanked the belt tight with more force than necessary. ""Yeah, yeah. Katherine. Whoever she is.""



The doorbell rang. Shit. Dr. Peterson was early.



I sprinted to straighten the nightstand, shoving it back into place. A quick scan of the room – nothing else seemed obviously disturbed. I grabbed a pillow and wedged it under Alexander's head, trying to make it look like he'd dozed off.



Dr. Peterson strode in, medical bag in hand. ""Evening, Ms. Harper.""



""Doctor. Thank you for coming so quickly."" I gestured to Alexander. ""I found him like this when I came to drop off some urgent documents.""



The doctor knelt beside the bed, checking Alexander's pulse. ""Any idea what he might have taken?""



""None. He seemed... not himself."" Understatement of the century. ""Dilated pupils, erratic behavior.""



Dr. Peterson lifted Alexander's eyelids, shining a small light. ""Probably some party drug. Though it's unlike him to indulge alone.""



""Should I call security? His driver?""



""No need. I'll stay until he comes around."" He pulled out a blood pressure cuff. ""You should head home, Ms. Harper. I've got it from here.""



I nodded, gathering my purse. ""Of course. Thank you again.""



I hurried to the elevator, my reflection in the metal doors nearly composed except for my swollen lips and flushed cheeks.



The night air slapped my face as I hailed a cab, needing to get home and think.



""Where to?"" the driver asked.



""Anywhere but here."" I caught his concerned look in the rearview mirror. ""Sorry. 42nd and 8th, please.""



As the city lights blurred past, I wondered how I'd face Alexander tomorrow. Would he remember? And more importantly – who the hell was Katherine?



Chapter 3

Madison



I woke up feeling like I'd been hit by a truck - a very sexy, Alexander Knight-shaped truck. My body ached in places I'd forgotten existed, and my inner thighs bore the telltale bruises of last night's activities.



""Get it together, Madison,"" I muttered to my reflection as I applied concealer under my eyes. Despite my best makeup efforts, the woman staring back looked debauched.



The subway ride to work was torture. Every bump and sway reminded me of how Alexander had moved inside me. How his hands had gripped my hips. How he'd called me Katherine.



Katherine. The name bounced around my skull like an angry ping-pong ball.



I'd spent half the night googling ""Katherine Alexander Knight"" with zero results. Not that I was jealous or anything. I mean, why would I be jealous of someone whose name my boss moaned while high on God-knows-what?



The elevator ride up to the office felt longer than usual. I checked my phone seventeen times in thirty seconds, praying there wouldn't be a message from Alexander. Nothing. Thank God.



I peeked into Alexander's office. Empty. The relief that flooded through me was embarrassing.



Collapsing into my chair, I buried my face in my hands. ""This is fine. Everything's fine. He probably doesn't even remember. And if he does, well... I'll just move to Antarctica. I hear they need secretaries there.""



My phone buzzed. I jumped so hard that my knee slammed into the desk drawer.



I rubbed my throbbing knee while checking the message. Just a spam email about enlarging body parts I didn't possess.



The morning crawled by in a haze of paranoia. Every footstep in the hallway had me tensing like a guilty teenager. By ten, my neck muscles felt like steel cables from constantly whipping around to check the door.

I always had trouble connecting with neurotypical people & groups (let alone forming friendships or relationships) so I'm trying to find autistic adult-friendly ones.

I can't seem to find good communities here for us / them though because the ones on Facebook are mostly for *parents of autistic kids* (and who seem to be in lower social or economic strata which is its own communication issues but that's another story). I think I would relate better to autistic adults who are mostly self-directed or self-advocating (even if in daily life they might also be dependent in some things, like just living w/ parents / family &c.)

second option would be like Filipino-majority online communities with at least some hope I could meet some of them.

what I'm like if that helps with finding groups:

I write & do art, I don't game (but might be open in future to it), I sometimes watch usually more obscure animes or shows online but also long-form podcasts, I don't listen to music a lot but I do like metal & electro swing genres amongst others (not too picky though) I read a lot (including comics) & I love cats, coffees, the beach & sometimes cultural or historical places if I could travel. I go for runs sometimes on weekends or bike if I get the time for it.

1pgc2nk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pgc2nk,Home made Camper Trailer,"Have been building a camper trailer and finally got to take it out this weekend. It has a kitchen compartment, storage compartment, slide-out kitchen bench, drawers, a rooftop tent, hot and cold water, 160L water tanks and a hose for putting out fire or washing feet. There is 200Ah of battery and 500w of solar charging - a fixed panel on the tent and a flexible panel to position for the sun. A 3000w inverter powers the speaker, coffee machine and induction cooktop.

A 10” touchscreen displays environmental data and controls lighting and there are backup switches in the storage compartment in case of system failure. A raspberry pi runs the user interface and has a GPS to calculate your position and sunset/sunrise times to trigger lighting scenes, a temperature sensor, a voltage sensor for battery level and a fuel sensor for water tank level. Current transformers show how much solar is being generated. All panels and drawers are monitored by reed switches which turns on the associated light to the evening or night level depending on the time. All lights are dimmable and fade in/out to keep a gentle atmosphere while away in the bush. The lights can fade between white and red to keep bugs away. When there’s internet available the touchscreen will scrape the weather forecast for the current location and show a warning if rain is expected. There is a second touchscreen in the tent for activating lighting to the ensuite/shower tent in the night. If you jump on the wifi you can access the user interface from your phone. Since the control system is Linux based, Starlink can be connected to the raspberry pi or usb tether someone’s work phone to it for free internet (lol). Wifi is provided by a UniFi WAP in the kitchen compartment.

Madison



I lifted my gaze from the computer screen as the elevator dinged. A woman in a red dress strutted toward me, her heels clicking against the marble floor like a timer counting down to chaos.



""I'm here to see Alexander."" She planted her manicured hands on my desk, leaning forward with a smile that didn't reach her eyes.



""Do you have an appointment?""



""I don't need one. We have... history. Just tell Shim Vanessa's here.""



""I'm sorry, but Mr. Knight only takes scheduled appointments. I can help you set one up for next week-""



""Listen here, little secretary."" She interrupted. ""I'm Vanessa Caldwell. I spent the night with Alexander last weekend, and I'm not leaving until I see him.""



""As I mentioned, without an appointment or express permission from Mr. Knight-""



""Who do you think you are? Just because you stand next to him all day, fetching his coffee and taking notes, you think you're special?""



""Ma'am, I need to ask you to leave-""



""You're pathetic. Playing gatekeeper, pretending you matter. I bet you fantasize about him noticing you, don't you? Honey, even if you spread those thighs on his desk, he wouldn't give you a second glance. He needs a real woman, not some desperate little assistant playing dress-up in her Target blazer.""



""Security will escort you out if necessary.""



""You wouldn't dare. Do you know who my father is? I could have your job with one phone call.""



""And I could remove you from the premises with one button."" I placed my hand near the security alert under my desk. ""Your choice, Ms. Caldwell.""



Vanessa's face contorted with rage. In one fluid motion, she snatched the water pitcher from my desk and emptied its contents over my head. Ice-cold water drenched my hair, makeup, and brand-new blouse – for the record, it wasn't from Target.



""Oops."" She smirked, dropping the empty pitcher on my keyboard with a clatter. ""Looks like someone needs a towel.""



But before I could process my next move, the elevator dinged again.



Alexander Knight stepped out, filling the lobby like a storm front. His easy stride faltered as he took in the scene - me looking like a drowned rat, Vanessa preening like a cat who'd gotten the cream, and water pooling across my desk and expensive electronics.



""Well."" His voice cut through the tension. ""This is certainly not the greeting I expected.""



Vanessa's face lit up. ""Alexander, darling! I was just-""



""Assaulting my PA and damaging company property?"" He crossed to us in three strides. ""Bold strategy.""



""I was simply having a conversation with your PA."" Her voice dripped honey while her eyes stabbed mine. ""She refused to let me see you.""



""Because that's her job."" Alexander handed me his monogrammed handkerchief. His touch sent an unwanted tingle up my arm. ""Miss Harper follows my protocols to the letter. That's why she's invaluable.""



I dabbed at my face, grateful I'd worn waterproof mascara today. The handkerchief smelled like his cologne – a detail I wasn't focusing on.



""But darling,"" Vanessa stepped closer to Alexander, her hip swaying. ""After our magical night together-""



""You mean the charity gala where you had too much champagne, and I called you a cab? That was hardly magical, though I hear you've been telling a different version around town.""



I bit my lip to hide my smile.



""I-"" Vanessa gaped like a fish.



""Now,"" Alexander's hand came to rest on my shoulder, and I prayed he couldn't feel how my pulse jumped. ""You've just assaulted my favorite employee and probably destroyed about ten thousand dollars worth of equipment. Would you like me to call security or the cops?""



I felt my cheeks heat at my 'favorite employee.' He was always like this—charming, flirtatious, and making everyone feel special. It didn't mean anything.



""You wouldn't dare."" But Vanessa's confidence wavered.



""Try me. I protect my people, especially those who keep my life running smoothly. In fact, I should ban you from the building entirely. What do you think, Miss Harper?""



""I think that sounds reasonable, Mr. Knight."" I stayed professional despite his touch warming me.



Vanessa's face cycled through fifty shades of red. ""This is ridiculous. You'll regret this. Both of you will.""



""The only thing I regret is not having my phone out to record this tantrum. Security's on their way up. I suggest you leave before they arrive.""



""My father will hear about this!""



""I'm sure he will. Give Charles my regards. Tell him his company's stock is looking shaky these days.""



As soon as the elevator doors closed on her scowling face, Alexander's hand left my shoulder, and I immediately missed its warmth – a thought I quickly shoved into my brain's 'do not examine' folder.



I stood from my chair, water dripping onto the floor.



""Are you alright?"" Alexander's brow furrowed as he assessed the damage. ""She didn't hurt you, did she?""



""Just my pride. And maybe my electronics."" I poked at my waterlogged keyboard, which responded with an alarming spark.



""Leave that. I'll have IT bring up replacements."" He pulled out his phone. ""John can get you to the mall in fifteen minutes. Use the company card to pick up whatever you need—clothes, makeup, hair products.""



""Thank you, Mr. Knight, but it's no big deal. My shift ends in an hour, and I have a prior engagement after work.""



""You're going to sit in wet clothes for another hour?""



""I'll manage,"" I insisted with a smile. ""But I appreciate the offer.""



He gave me a look that said he didn't believe me but nodded anyway.



I pushed open the door to the restaurant, ready for a relaxing dinner with Hazel after my disaster of a day. The hostess led me toward our usual corner booth, but I stopped short. Instead of just my best friend, a man sat beside her.



""Mads!"" Hazel bounced up, waving like I might miss her in the half-empty restaurant. ""You made it! Come meet Derek!""



I forced a smile and sat across from them. Of course, Hazel would ambush me with a surprise blind date after the day I'd had.



""Mads, this is Derek. He's a financial analyst, and I met him at that yoga retreat last month."" Hazel's eyes sparkled with matchmaking glee. ""Derek, meet my best friend Madison.""



""Pleasure."" Derek flashed perfectly whitened teeth. ""Hazel told me so much about you.""



I resisted the urge to kick Hazel under the table. ""All good things, I hope?""



We fumbled through awkward small talk about the weather and restaurant specials until Derek excused himself to the restroom.



The moment he was out of earshot, Hazel pounced. ""Isn't he dreamy? Those shoulders! And he's so successful - you should see his condo downtown.""



""Haze...""



""Come on, when did you last go on a real date? You work too hard, sweetie. Everyone needs someone to lean on.""



""I'm fine on my own right now. With Mom's treatments and everything...""



""How is she doing?"" Hazel's expression softened.



""The same. The new medication is expensive, but..."" I shrugged.



""And that brother of yours is still MIA?"" Hazel's face darkened. ""What a selfish asshole, leaving you to handle everything alone.""



""I don't want to talk about him. Mom worked three jobs to raise us. The least I can do is help her now.""



Derek slid back into the booth, adjusting his designer tie. ""Sorry about that. Now, where were we?""



""Madison was just telling us about her day at work,"" Hazel chirped.



""Oh, right - you work as a secretary or something?"" Derek asked.



""Personal assistant to Alexander Knight at Knight Industries.""



""Alexander Knight? The CEO?"" He leaned forward, elbows on the table. ""Must be quite the... demanding position.""



""Excuse me?""



""Come on, we all know how these things work."" He winked. ""Beautiful young woman, powerful executive—I'm sure you've found ways to make yourself invaluable to the company.""



Hazel's jaw dropped. ""Derek!""



""What? I'm just saying what everyone thinks when they see these arrangements."" He gestured vaguely at me. ""No judgment here. A girl's got to use her assets.""



""You absolute pig."" Hazel's face flushed red. ""Get out.""



""Hey, I'm just being honest. No need to get defensive-""



""Out!"" Hazel stood up, pointing toward the door. ""Now.""



""Alright, alright. Guess some people can't handle the truth."" He slid out of the booth, adjusting his jacket. ""Call me when you're ready to be real about things.""



We watched him weave between tables toward the exit. Hazel collapsed back into her seat, mortified.



""Oh my god, Mads. I am so, so sorry. I can't believe I thought he was decent. He seemed so nice at yoga!""



""Hey, at least we found out he was trash before the appetizers arrived."" I grabbed the menu, determined to salvage our evening. ""Now, about those loaded nachos we always get...""



""But still! The things he said about you and Mr. Knight!"" She shook her head. ""I feel awful.""



""Forget him. Seriously."" I waved down a waiter. ""The nachos and two margaritas, please. Make mine a double.""



Hazel brightened with mischief. ""Although, maybe Derek had a point. Not about you being - you know - but about Mr. Knight liking you. I've seen the way he looks at you.""



I choked on my water, sputtering. ""What? No! That's - that's impossible. He's my boss!""



""Why not? You're smart, gorgeous, and he's clearly interested.""



""Stop it!"" I grabbed a napkin to wipe my chin. ""It's not like that at all.""



Hazel burst out laughing. ""Relax, I'm kidding! Everyone knows Alexander Knight is Manhattan's most notorious playboy. Different supermodels every week, yacht parties in Monaco."" She leaned forward. ""Just be careful, okay? Don't let that pretty face and charm fool you. Men like him don't do relationships - they collect trophies.""



""Trust me, I know exactly who he is."" My phone buzzed.



I pulled out my phone to check the message. Alexander's name flashed on the screen.



""325 Park Avenue, Penthouse. Come now.""



No explanation, no context. Typical Alexander.



""Everything okay?"" Hazel peered across the table.



""Work."" I grabbed my purse, already sliding out of the booth. ""Rain check on those nachos?""



""Again? This is getting ridiculous. It's almost 8 PM!""



""I know, I know. But-""



""But nothing! You're not his personal servant. You have a life, too. What could possibly be so urgent?""



""It's probably another last-minute networking event. He does this sometimes—invites potential investors over for drinks. Someone has to coordinate with catering and handle the guest list.""



""And that someone always has to be you?""



""It's my job.""



""Your job ended three hours ago."" Hazel's voice softened. ""I worry about you, you know?""



""I know you worry. But this job - the benefits, the salary - it's helping Mom fight. I can't risk losing it.""



""Just be careful, okay?""



I nodded, already halfway to the door. The cool night air hit my face as I flagged down a cab.



The cab wound through Manhattan's glittering streets. Mom's medical bills haunted me, mounting higher each month. I couldn't mess this up. Not when she needed me.



325 Park Avenue loomed ahead, all gleaming glass and steel stretching into the night sky. The doorman nodded as I crossed the marble lobby to the private elevator. My finger hesitated over the penthouse button. Something felt... off.



Usually, when Alexander hosted impromptu gatherings, the lobby buzzed with activity—caterers rushing supplies, guests arriving in designer suits and cocktail dresses. Tonight, there was silence.



My heels clicked against the marble floor as I stepped out, echoing through the empty space. Warm lighting spilled across modern furniture and floor-to-ceiling windows, showcasing the city's sparkle below.



""Mr. Knight?""



No response. Just the soft whir of the central air.



The hair on my neck stood up. Something definitely wasn't right.



A floorboard creaked behind me.



I spun around, heart hammering. Alexander stood there, leaning casually against the doorframe.



He stepped forward, closing the distance between us in three long strides. Before I could react, he had me cornered against the wall, one hand braced beside my head.



Chapter 2

Madison



His presence was intoxicating. Alexander's cologne wrapped around me, lingering like dark spices and something earthy. My pulse quickened as he leaned in, our faces just inches apart.



""You're here,"" he murmured.



""Mr. Knight, what's going on?"" My voice trembled. I placed a hand on his chest, meaning to push him back, but all I felt was the chiseled muscles under his shirt.



He took my hand, interlacing his fingers with mine and pressing it back against the wall. The heat from his touch was electric, coursing straight to my core. My breathing turned shallow, and my heart thudded in my ears. His eyes were dark, pupils blown wide.



""You're really here."" He whispered huskily. His gaze swept my face, lingering on my lips as his breath warmed my cheek.



""Are you... okay?"" I stammered. His pupils seemed larger than normal, almost swallowing the blue of his irises. Something felt off. Was he on drugs?



""I'm more than okay."" He nuzzled against my neck, lips brushing my skin. ""You're perfect.""



""I think you might need medical assistance—""



He didn't let me finish. His mouth captured mine, and the world tilted on its axis. The kiss was fierce, desperate, and filled with a hunger that took my breath away. His free hand found my waist, pulling me against him. Hard. Unyielding.



The sensible part of my brain screamed for me to push him away, to get help. But then his tongue parted my lips, and my knees went weak. I grabbed onto his shoulders to steady myself, my fingers digging into the fine fabric of his suit.



His kiss grew more intense, leaving me scarcely able to think or breathe. As our tongues entwined, a moan escaped my lips—one I wouldn't have admitted to if questioned.



My hands roamed over his shoulders and back, feeling the hard muscles flex beneath my touch. His grip on my waist tightened, lifting me effortlessly.



Before I knew it, he maneuvered me backward, guiding me toward the bedroom. We stumbled, our lips never parting, until the back of my knees hit the king-sized bed. He gently pushed me onto the mattress, positioning himself above me. His eyes were wild, hungry.



""Off,"" he growled, tugging at my blouse impatiently.



I fumbled with the buttons, my fingers clumsy in their eagerness. Finally, I managed to undo the fabric and slip out of it, my breasts spilling out, my lacy bra doing little to contain them.



His gaze darkened, and he yanked the bra cups down, exposing my hardened nipples to the cool air.



He bent down, taking one nipple into his mouth, sucking hard. I arched up, gasping as his teeth grazed me. His free hand roamed lower, slipping under the waistband of my pants. The moment he found my clit through the thin fabric of my panties, a sharp jolt shot through me.



""Fuck,"" I moaned, my fingers threading through his hair, holding him to my chest.



With one swift motion, he tugged my pants and panties down my legs. The cool air hit my wet pussy, making me shiver. His hands spread my thighs apart, his fingers slipping into my wet heat, pressing inside me. I cried out, hips bucking against his hand.



""You're so fucking wet already,"" he muttered, almost to himself. ""I could take you right here.""



Before I could respond, his fingers withdrew, leaving me aching. I watched, breathless, as he quickly moved to unbuckle his belt and unzip his pants. He didn't bother removing his clothes, but his massive, rock-hard cock sprang free, and my eyes widened at the sight.



He climbed between my legs, positioning the head of his cock at my entrance, teasing me with its thickness. I squirmed, my body screaming for him to fill me.



He thrust into me hard and fast, sheathing himself fully in one brutal stroke. The initial stretch had me seeing stars, but soon, pleasure overwhelmed everything. His cock filled me completely, hitting spots I didn't know existed.



My nails dug into his back as he set a punishing rhythm, each thrust sending waves of ecstasy crashing through me.



His mouth crashed against mine in a desperate, bruising kiss. His hands gripped my hips hard as he pounded into me. Our bodies collided with slick sounds, mingling with our groans and panting breaths.



""God, you're so tight,"" he growled, breath hot and ragged. ""Feels fucking incredible.""



We moved together, our bodies entwined in a primal dance. I felt the pressure building, the peak of my orgasm just within reach. He angled his hips, and the change in depth brought him harder against my G-spot. I cried out, my entire body tensing.



""I'm close, Alexander,"" I gasped, my nails raking down his back.



My voice seemed to spur him on, his movements growing even more frenzied. He thrust into me with a force that had me clutching at the sheets, trying to ground myself against the intense pleasure.



""Yes, fuck, take it all,"" he groaned, his pace becoming erratic. ""Come for me.""



His encouragement drove me over the edge. With a final scream, I shattered, my pussy clenching tight around his cock as waves of orgasm washed over me. I rode out the storm, body convulsing as he continued fucking me through it.



It was then, just as my orgasm began to wane, that I heard him mutter, ""Fuck, Katherine.""



I froze. My mind reeled. Katherine?! Who the hell was Katherine?



But I couldn't dwell on it for long because he was still fucking me, his cock pistoning in and out with savage intensity. My overstimulated body responded despite my confusion, another climax already building.



""Katherine, your pussy is so fucking tight."" He drove into me one last time, spilling inside me with a guttural moan. His body trembled, his release triggering my own. Another orgasm rippled through me, leaving me breathless and shaking.



As the haze of pleasure faded, reality sank in. Alexander had called another woman's name while fucking me. He didn't even know who I was.



As he collapsed next to me on the bed, his breathing heavy, I stared at the ceiling, my mind racing. Who was Katherine? Did she work for him, too, or was she just one of his many conquests? The thought gnawed at me like a persistent itch I couldn't scratch.



I slipped out from under his arm, my legs still trembling. Alexander's soft snores filled the bedroom as I gathered my scattered clothes. Of course, he'd pass out - typical man. At least he hadn't called me ""baby"" or some other generic pet name. No, he'd gone with ""Katherine"" instead.



I stumbled to the bathroom, wincing at my reflection. My carefully straightened hair now resembled a bird's nest, and my lipstick... well, that was definitely not where lipstick should be.



As I cleaned up, my mind wandered to the stack of NDAs in my desk drawer - all the women who'd crossed paths with Alexander Knight.



""At least I didn't have to draft my own NDA,"" I muttered. Being Alexander's PA meant cleaning up his messes and arranging flowers and ""sorry"" gifts for the parade of models and socialites he left in his wake. But Katherine? That name wasn't in any of my files.



I smoothed down my outfit and checked my phone - 10:27 PM. The doctor would still be awake. I scrolled through my contacts, finding Dr. Peterson's number. My thumb hovered over the call button as Alexander's snores echoed from the bedroom.



""Dr. Peterson? Sorry to bother you so late."" I kept my voice steady and professional. Like I hadn't just had mind-blowing sex with my boss. ""It's Madison Harper, Mr. Knight's PA.""



""What's he done now?"" Dr. Peterson sighed.



""He seems altered. Dilated pupils, unusual behavior. I found him like this when I came to drop off some urgent paperwork."" The lie slipped out easily. Too easily.

Aria's POV



I stood in front of the chapel.



Pink roses and white lilies decorated every corner. My favorite flowers.



The guests were already seated. Soon, at the end of the red carpet would stand the man I once loved, waiting to marry his bride.



Everything was perfect.



Except I wasn't the bride.



“I really need to see Jace today.”



I begged the bodyguard blocking the door. A beat-up suitcase and two boxes sat at my feet. Everything I owned in the world.



""No you don’t. Get out of here,"" the bodyguard said icily.



I saw disgust in his eyes. Yeah I get it. No one has sympathy for the crazy ex who shows up at the wedding.



But I have my reason to be here.



""If you don't let me see him, I'll just stand here and all the guests will see me,"" I threatened under my breath.



Jace wouldn't want that. Especially not today.



Because today, he was marrying Delilah Hart.



She is the sister to Alpha Grayson Hart of Redstone Pack. A 100% high-society darling.



All the guys in the world knew that marrying Delilah would totally change their lives, including Jace.



So he made the easy call—marrying the lady who could turn him from a small-town nobody into a golden boy. And dump the girl who stayed by his side for last 4 years when he had nothing.



He didn’t want any guests to see me here. Because I represented his broke, embarrassing past. He wanted me nowhere near his glittering new world.



Tears stung my eyes as I thought of that. Like a knife was twisting in my chest.



“Let me in or I’m starting to yell.” I choked.



The bodyguard frowned. ""Wait here.""



He finally called somebody. A few minutes later, he waved me in.



I wiped my eyes and struggled into the hall with my suitcase and boxes.



Instantly, I felt out of place.



Everything reeked of wealth here. Expensive perfume. Manicured nails. Not a hair out of place. It was everything you imagined about the upper-class and way more.



And me?



I was wearing a baggy T-shirt and jeans. My sneakers had holes.



""God, a homeless. She stinks."" A woman mutter as I walked by.



No it couldn’t be. I just showered this morning. My hair still smelled like strawberries and coconut.



But poverty had a scent, apparently.



""Mr. Carter is inside."" The guard took me to a closed door and warned, “Make it quick.”



“Thank you.”



The room inside looked like something out of a movie. Marble floors. White carpet. A chandelier that probably cost more than my apartment.



And there he was.



The man I used to love.



Adjusting his bowtie in front of a mirror.



Jace was still heartbreakingly handsome. No wonder Delilah fell for him.



When he turned and fixed his gorgeous blue eyes upon me, I still felt my heart race.



""Hey, Jace,"" I said quietly.



And immediately, I wanted to punch myself.



Hey, Jace?!



That’s the best I could do?



His face was ice cold.



""You shouldn't come, Aria.” he said with a frown. “Your ratty suitcase, your ripped jeans, your Vans. None of that belongs here.""



Well if you wanted to be brutal and vicious, that’s how it’s done.



""Don’t you think I deserve an explanation? You dumped me over a fucking email!"" I snapped.



He shrugged. ""Look around you. The wealthiest people in the world came for me today. This suit I’m wearing cost more than you can make in your entire life. What more explanation do you want?""



Wow.



I always knew he was a cold, calculating bastard.



I just didn’t realize how deep it ran.



""Maybe chasing Alpha’s sister got you here faster. But you know what? When she finds out how shallow and cold you are. You’ll lose it all.""



Anger flared across his face.



""I know how to love someone! I just won't waste that on a small-town girl like you.” he said freezingly, “Are we done here?""



“No.”



I took a deep breath and got into the real reason I came.



""You're marrying a rich girl. Fine. But why did you have to get me fired?""



Yeah. I used to work for this jerk.



From intern to full-time at Apex Corp, he was my supervisor.



Our office romance was a secret. And just days ago, I found out he was getting married with Apex CEO’s sister. And I was out of a job thanks to him.



""Right, your job.” The jerk shrugged, “You got your job all thanks to me. Now that I’m not around, maybe they finally saw how incompetent and stupid you are. Problem?""



Was he fucking kidding me?!



""I graduated top of my class. Made it through 7 rounds of interviews. My performance exceeded every quarterly target. I earned that job!"" I snapped.



“Come on, Aria. You really gonna be so naïve?”



He walked closer, smirking.



""You passed the interviews because I said so. Your sales? I contacted those customers for you. Without me, you'd be nothing but a pretty face.""



He seized my chin and looked me over with a disgusting look. I slapped his hand away.



""Give me my job back,” I hissed, my voice slightly trembling. “My dad’s debt. My grandma’s medical bills…I need the money. You of all people should know what it’s like to be poor. Don’t. Make. Me. Beg.""



I was throwing my pride at his feet.



But he just laughed.



""Well, how about I offer you a deal?"" he said as though he’d been waiting for this moment.



He brushed my hair back, fingers trailing down to my collarbone. I shivered in disgust.



""You and I. We never fuck. You were so clinging to that pathetic no-sex-before-marriage rule. Maybe it's time to grow up. Let me fuck you once and I’ll write you very handsome check. How does that sound?""



I widened my eyes in shock.



Then I slapped him. HARD.



“FUCKING HELL…What the hell are you doing?! I’m getting married in front of everyone in fucking 10 minutes!” He roared covering his swollen face.



""Fuck you, Jace!” I yelled, “You're a spineless freeloading puss! And hey—congrats on the wedding. Hope your junk is soft like a fucking spaghetti tonight!""



Then I stormed out dragging my suitcase and boxes, ignoring his angry curses behind me.



Hot tears poured down as I dashed across the hallway.



God this couldn’t be any worse.



I was prepared to drop all my self-esteem and begged with my life. Because I needed the job and money.



But I still let him get to me.



Now what do I do?



My salary barely covered my rent, my father’s debt and grandma’s bill. Now with my job gone, I already got kicked out by my landlord. I probably had to sleep in a park tonight.



So do I go back and let that jerk win? Let him humiliate me...No. I’d rather die than that…



""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled.



Too late.



I slammed right into the man in front of me.



He was tall. So tall I felt like I’d just walked into a brick wall.



His diamond cufflink was sharp like a blade. When we collided, it sliced clean through my thin T-shirt with a loud rip.



In one second, the front of my shirt was torn open, exposing my white lace bra.



“Ah!” I gasped and looked up.



This was the most handsome man I’d ever seen. His face was like a statue carved by a master artist. And his expression was so cold and distant.



When he looked down at me, I swear I was about to drown in those stormy gray eyes of his.



Suddenly, I recognized who he was.



This was Alpha of Redstone Pack. CEO of Apex Corporation.



Jace’s brother-in-law.



THE legendary. Grayson Hart.



“Aria Collins?”



His voice was sexy and velvety.



He lowered his head and his eyes dropped to the exposed part of my bra. Maybe it was just my imagination, but the color of his eyes seemed to darken as he stared.



Wherever his gaze landed, my skin started burning up.



But wait.



How did he know my name?



Chapter 2 With Ex's Brother-in-law

Aria’s POV



Of course I recognized him. God, who didn’t?



I’d met him at the Apex gala. His face was on every finance magazine cover, and any time you turned on a TV, there he was—linked to the latest scandal with some actress or model.



But there was no way he’d know who I was.



“I-I…Hello, Alpha Grayson,” I stammered.



He turned his eyes away and said to a nearby guard, “Escort Ms. Collins out.”



“Yes, Alpha.”



The guards stepped in immediately, stretching out their arms like I was some kind of contaminant that might taint Grayson’s perfectly tailored suit.



“Wait a minute. You’re not going to say something about my shirt?” It’s torn beyond repair and was showing my breasts.



He paused. Just for a brief second. Then flicked something down at my feet.



I looked down. A blank check.



“I need a shirt that can cover my front. Not your hush money.” I gritted with humiliation.



But he didn’t even glance back and just walked away.



“God,” I muttered under my breath.



Can you believe these rich bastards?



They think they can buy everything with money.



People nearby were all staring, snickering under their breath. I tried to cover my chest and grab my things to escape, but it was hard to do all that with just two hands.



“Oh my god…Aria Collins?”



Three girls emerged from the whispering crowd. I took one look at them and sighed internally.



Great. Just when I thought today couldn’t get any worse.



“Hello. Layla. Sabrina. Brielle.” I said dryly.



I used to work in the same team with these girls back at Apex. We were all under Jace.



These girls adored Jace. They spent more time flirting with him by the coffee machine than actually working. Which left me doing most of their work.



After I got fired, and when news of my secret relationship with Jace got out, they decided I was public enemy number one.



“What are you even doing here, Aria? Trying to win back your ex at his wedding? That’s a new low even for you,” Layla snickered.



“I’m not here to win anyone back.” I tried to push past them.



But they blocked me.



“What happened to your shirt?” Brielle snickered. “Did you seriously walk in here with your bra out? Is this like some low-budget fashion statement?”



They burst into laughter together.



“You could be completely naked and Jace still wouldn’t give a damn,” Sabrina squeaked. “Because he’s marrying Lady Delilah. THE Delilah Hart! Redstone Pack’s sweetheart. And you…well you’re just a poor-ass small-town girl.”



I stopped in my track and gave them a cold glare, “Oh yeah? Well at least this smalltown girl actually dated Jace. And you all got nothing. Do you know how many times I had to listen to him complained about your screechy voices and cheesy perfume after we got home? Apparently he rather be with me than any of you.”



Their jaws dropped.



“Jace would never say that!” Brielle cried.



“And my perfume isn’t cheesy!” Sabrina screamed.



“Word for word,” I rolled my eyes. “Now move. Or I’m rolling this suitcase over your pretty little skirts.”



They looked like ruffled chickens, but they parted. I quickly shoved my dingy luggage ahead like a weapon and stormed out of the church.



Rich people were assholes.



Grayson, Jace, and their whole damn minions.



I struggled to get my suitcase down the steps, and once I hit the street, cold wind slapped me in the face.



It’s almost night. But I had no idea where to go.



I could crash in the hospital with my grandma, but she’d ask too many questions. Like why I hadn’t brought Jace around recently, or why I wasn’t staying at my apartment. I didn’t want her to know how bad things had gotten.



I thought about the park. Sleeping on a bench. But in a ripped T-shirt that exposed my whole front? Horrible idea.



So I texted my best friend, May, asking to stay at her place for a few days. She was my rock. If the whole world turned against me, at least I still had her.



She texted back right away inviting me to come over.



Dragging my suitcase across the street toward the bus stop, I told myself it was going to be okay. This horrible day was going to end.



Then I heard them.



“Hey, nice shirt!”



A group of street wolves were loitering near the stop.



I hugged myself tighter and curled into the bench, hoping they’d get bored and leave.



“C’mon baby, drop your hands. Let us see what you’re working with.”



Go away. Go away. Go away.



“You rip that shirt yourself? Damn that’s wild. I like that in a girl.” One of them moved closer, reaching for my shoulder.



“Fuck off!” I snapped, my voice shaking.



But it only fired them up.



“Oh, feisty. Shake those tits for me!”



They grabbed my wrists, yanked my arms down. My T-shirt gaped open completely, revealing my lace bra. The cold air made my skin pebble. They laughed even louder.



I struggled and screamed. My wolf growled in rage.

This is for the language of dragons in the *[Pick-n-Mix Comix](https://archiveofourown.org/users/picknmixcomix)* universe, where they take and inspire bits of languages from the worlds and planets they visit. Usually, it's fairly similar in grammatical style and construction to English simply for coconvenience's sake, but words get compounded often (romanized with dashes in between them) and articles are placed as suffixes after the words they're aoplying to. Dragorean is usually written in a romanized style in-universe known as Akthorian Phonetic Standard, and also has an orthographic system called the Dragorean Diacritic Set, which uses 38 letters, diacritics, and digraph markers to present pronunciation-accurate spellings of various words; whether they're originally written in Mezhon runes, Tovoshok's *ksingirima* logographic system, or anything else.

But this post isn't about *ksingirima*, it's about *fej*. *Fej*, quite literally, is just coffee, and because the word itself is not descriptive and isn't a compound like ""bean-juice"" or ""brown stuff"" to tell you what it is, you'd need more words to describe what fej is to you, so I felt like using the opportunity to write a small set of paragraphs *in* Dragorean, like a dragon or *Dathzhad* (Dragorean's autonym) speaker, would be describing it to you.

First, in romanized Mezhon Dragorean, based on how Mezhon runes presented its words:

> *Fej zenul wanunen-wesai to-knarl. Knarl darlor zenul fod. Knarl darlor tam-sidditho zenul nav-skish tam-sidditho vadt tam-satum-kinazhi-ma. Suv naz hendak, fej zenul satum-zoj valik zenul kuteyraz tam-sidditho managi dath-ma, kuv managi zhu-ma tam-sidditho vadt.*

> *Fej selul meylo kuv bon suv nav-wisa ebu dath-wesai kuteyrul oj.*

> *Fej zenul bon.*

> *Dath-ma nav-skishul fej suv managi hendak-ma kuv kinazhi-ma.*

And again, in Dragorean Diacritics, which should hopefully be recognizable if you know the tones and such:

> *Fej zēnúl ƿánūnın-ƿēsæ tō-knárl. Knárl ðárlōr zēnúl fōð. Knárl ðárlōr tam-sıðēþō zēnúl náv-skış tam-sıðēþō vát tam-sŭtūm-kınážē-má. Sūv naz ‘ınðak, fej zēnúl sŭtūm-záj valık zēnúl kūtāraz tam-sıðēþō mŭnágē ðaþ-má, kūv mŭnágē žū-má tam-sıðēþō vát.*

> *Fej sélúl mālō kūv bán sūv náv-ƿēsá ébū ðaþ-ƿēsæ kūtārúl ōj.*

> *Fej zēnúl bán.*

> *Ðaþ-má náv-skışúl fej sūv mŭnágē ‘ınðak-má kūv kınážē-má.*

(All long vowels are long vowels, the apostrophe is /ħ	/, and ""kn"" are separate sounds. I might put IPA in here in an edit or by comment in a bit, although there's a chart on the in-progress page on *[Grimoire Faire](https://grimoirefaire.neocities.org/otherpages/learndragorean.html)*.)

Then, translation into English, as direct as possible:

> Coffee be(actively, in the process of) oneness-a of-(nourishing food). (Nourishing food) can(generally) be(actively, in the process of) food(generally). (Nourishing food) can(generally) at-side be(actively, in the process of) mouth-swallow at-side that at-some-time-(pluralization marker). In any occurring, coffee be(actively, in the process of) some-object which be(actively, in the process of) consumed at-side many dragon-(pluralization marker), and many person-(pluralization marker) at-side that.

> Coffee feels(actively, in the process of) caring and good in mouth-the when dragon-a consume(actively, in the process of) it(objective form).

> Coffee be(actively, in the process of) good.

> Dragon-(pluralization marker) mouth-swallow coffee in many occuring-(pluralization marker) and time(ongoing sense)-(pluralization marker).

More generally, applying interpretation to it:

> Coffee is a type of food (or ""nourishment"", or ""treat"", or ""breakfast"", or ""meal"", depending; there isn't a word for something which is a dessert but a drink, which coffee realistically sometimes can be, but go figure). Coffee can be food, in general. Coffee can also be liquid-which-you-can-drink (or ""a drink"", natch), as well, sometimes. In any case, coffee is something which can be consumed by many dragons and many people also.

> Coffee feels sweet and good in the mouth when a dragon consumes it.

> Coffee is good.

> Dragons drink coffee in many cases and times.",2,1765090099.0,conlangs,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share a project I’ve been working on called Tabsy.

I built it because I needed a simple way to track casual debts and split expenses with friends without all the bloat of the big finance apps. It’s designed to be private (data stays on your phone by default) and fast to use.

I also know everyone is tired of expensive subscriptions for basic utilities. I wanted to do this differently, so I priced the Premium Cloud Backup at the absolute lowest tier possible: $0.99 a month (or $10 a year).

I’m excited to finally share my debut novel, **Code and Crown: The Awakening**.

**The Pitch:** Adrion was a Systems Architect in Seattle until a runtime error ended his life. He reboots as Nia, a frail noble girl in a fantasy world. But he quickly realizes that reality here isn't just magic—it’s a programmable environment.

If you are tired of MCs who just ""feel"" the magic and get stronger by yelling louder, this is for you. This is a **Hard Magic System** treated like software engineering.

**What to expect:**

* **Magic as Code:** Spells require syntax. Mana is a battery that needs optimization. The MC treats spellcasting like debugging C++.
* **Kingdom Building:** The MC uses modern engineering and logic to fix a broken barony. Think *Civilization* meets *IDE*.
* **Progression:** The MC starts physically weak (cripplingly so) and must use intelligence and script optimization to survive against knights and monsters.
* **No Harem / Serious Tone:** This handles the reincarnation trauma and the gender dysphoria (25-year-old man in a girl's body) as a serious plot point, not a joke.

**Grab it on Kindle / KU here:**[https://www.amazon.com/Code-Crown-Awakening-Sascha-Maigatter-ebook/dp/B0G4K4GPP2/ref=sr\_1\_1?sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Crown-Awakening-Sascha-Maigatter-ebook/dp/B0G4K4GPP2/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1)

**Read the Prologue and Chapter 1 below to see how the System works:**

# Prologue: Fatal Exception

The cursor blinked.

That was the only movement in the room. A steady, rhythmic pulse of white against the obsidian void of the Integrated Development Environment. *Blink. Blink. Blink.* It was a hypnotic metronome, counting down the seconds of a life that was rapidly running out of runtime.

I stared at it, my eyes burning as if someone had rubbed crushed glass into them. The dry, gritty sensation was familiar—a constant companion for the last three years of my career at *Nexus Logistics Solutions*. The digital clock in the bottom right corner of my secondary monitor—a glowing red accusation—read **3:47 AM**.

I had been awake for... what? Twenty hours? Twenty-two? The integers were fuzzy, swimming in a sea of lukewarm energy drinks and profound cellular exhaustion. The deployment was due at 8:00 AM sharp. The client, a massive trans-continental shipping firm with more venture capital than common sense, had decided that migrating their entire legacy database over a holiday weekend was a brilliant strategic maneuver.

It wasn't. It was a suicide mission.

The backend migration was a disaster of biblical proportions. It wasn't just bad code; it was a crime scene. I was looking at a tangled mess of spaghetti code, undocumented dependencies, and variable names that looked like someone had smashed their face against a keyboard in a fit of rage. `tempVar1`, `doTheThing`, `pleaseWork`, `dont_touch_this_legacy_garbage`.

I was the only one left in the office—well, my home office in Seattle. The rain lashed against the windowpane, a relentless grey static that matched the fuzz in my brain. My ""team"" had logged off hours ago, citing family commitments or simply ghosting the Slack channel. I was the senior lead. I was the one with the ""ownership mindset."" I was the one who understood enough of the archaic, rusted-out architecture to keep the whole precarious tower from crashing down into the digital abyss.

""Just one more function,"" I muttered, my voice raspy and unused. It sounded like dry autumn leaves scraping over concrete. ""Fix the race condition in the user authentication module, and then... then I can sleep.""

I reached for the can of *Hyper-Volt* on my desk, my fingers trembling slightly. A tremor. That was new. Or maybe it wasn't. Maybe I just hadn't noticed it through the haze of sleep deprivation and the constant, low-level anxiety that hummed in my veins like a faulty power line.

My hand brushed the aluminum can. It was light. Too light. I knocked it over, and it clattered to the hardwood floor, the hollow metallic sound ringing out like a gunshot in the silent apartment. It rolled away, spinning in a slow, mocking circle, leaking the last few drops of neon-yellow chemical sludge onto the floorboards.

I didn't pick it up. I couldn't.

My arm felt heavy, impossibly heavy, as if gravity had suddenly decided to focus all its malice on my right limb. It felt like it was made of lead, encased in wet concrete. A dull ache began to radiate from my shoulder, a cold creeping numbness that defied the stuffy heat of the room.

*Focus, Adrion. Focus. You can sleep when the commit is pushed. You can sleep when the pipeline is green.*

I forced my hand back to the mechanical keyboard. The keys, usually a source of tactile comfort with their crisp *clack-clack-clack*, felt cold and hard under my fingertips. I typed a line of code, each keystroke a monumental effort of will, sending a signal down a nervous system that was rapidly degrading.

`if (user.hasPermission(ADMIN_OVERRIDE)) {`

My chest tightened.

It wasn't a gradual ache. It wasn't the slow burn of heartburn from too much pizza. It was a sharp, sudden squeeze, like a giant, invisible vice clamping down on my ribcage. The air was punched out of my lungs in a violent rush. I gasped, a wet, desperate sound, but no air came back in. My diaphragm had locked up. My fingers froze over the keyboard, hovering over the keys like paralyzed spiders.

The ""developer's crunch"" was a known occupational hazard. We joked about it. *Eat right, exercise, stand up every hour.* I hadn't stood up in six hours. I hadn't eaten a vegetable in three days. But this... this was different. This wasn't anxiety. This wasn't a panic attack.

This was a hardware failure.

The room tilted violently to the left. The glow of the monitors—usually a comforting, cool blue light—smeared into aggressive streaks of neon and blinding white. The hum of my computer fans, usually a white noise I ignored, roared in my ears like a jet engine taking off inside my skull.

*Panic.*

It surged through me, cold and electric, overriding the logic centers of my brain. I tried to stand up, to push my Herman Miller chair back, to reach for my phone on the desk. *Call 911. Call Mom. Call anyone.*

But my legs wouldn't obey. The signal from my brain was lost in transit, severed by the catastrophic failure occurring in my chest. Packet loss: 100%.

I slumped forward. My forehead hit the cool plastic of the keyboard with a dull thud.

`jkl;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;`

The keys clattered under the dead weight of my head, a meaningless stream of characters filling the screen, injecting garbage data into the critical function I was trying to save.

The pain exploded. It wasn't just in my chest anymore. It was a supernova, radiating down my left arm, shooting up into my jaw, exploding behind my eyes. It was a white-hot lance of agony that obliterated thought, obliterated fear, obliterated the deadline.

I couldn't breathe. I couldn't think. I couldn't exist.

*Is this it?*

The thought was strangely detached, floating above the sea of pain like a solitary lifeboat.

*Am I dying?*

*I didn't finish the migration. The client is going to be furious.*

The absurdity of the thought almost made me laugh, but my diaphragm was paralyzed. I was dying, alone in a dark apartment, and my last regret was uncommitted code for a logistics company that would replace me before my obituary was printed.

Darkness rushed in from the edges of my vision. It wasn't a fading to black; it was a physical presence, a cold, oily tide swallowing the code, the room, the pain. It rushed into my ears, silencing the roar of the fans. It rushed into my mind, erasing the logic, the syntax, the self.

And then, there was nothing.

No light. No sound. No Adrion.

Just the Void.

But in the Void, something flickered.

I saw it. Not with eyes—I didn't have eyes anymore—but with pure, stripped-down consciousness.

A screen.

A massive, translucent interface hovering in the nothingness. It was vast, stretching to infinity, glowing with a harsh, command-line green that reminded me of the old CRT monitors from the 90s.

    **SYSTEM ERROR: UNHANDLED EXCEPTION.**
    **ERROR CODE: 0xDEADDEAD.**
    **ATTEMPTING RECOVERY...**
    

*Recovery?* The concept floated in the void, untethered from language. *Who is recovering? There is no backup. There is no redundancy.*

    **DESTINATION NOT FOUND. REROUTING...**
    **SEARCHING FOR COMPATIBLE HOST...**
    

Lines of code scrolled past at impossible speeds. Hexadecimal strings, memory addresses, soul signatures. It was looking for a variable container that matched my data type.

    **HOST FOUND: NIA_VON_EISENWALD [STATUS: CRITICAL FAILURE]**
    **INITIATING SOUL TRANSFER PROTOCOL...**
    

*Wait. What? Nia? Who is—*

    **TRANSFER COMPLETE.**
    

Thousands of miles away—or perhaps worlds away, across the membrane of reality where the math of the universe breaks down and becomes magic—a garden bloomed.

It was a beautiful day in the Eisenwald. The sun was a warm, golden coin in a sky of perfect azure, a stark contrast to the rainy grey of Seattle. The air smelled of blooming roses, freshly cut grass, and the crisp scent of pine from the nearby mountains.

A girl was running.

She was ten years old, poised on that fragile, gangly threshold between childhood and adolescence. Her hair was the color of spun gold, catching the sunlight as it flew behind her in a tangled wave. She was tall for her age, her limbs long and coltish, clad in a white lace dress that was stained green at the knees—a testament to a tomboyish energy that defied her noble attire.

""Nia! Slow down!"" a woman's voice called from the stone terrace. It was a warm voice, filled with love and a hint of maternal worry.

But Nia didn't listen. She was chasing a butterfly. A magnificent creature with wings of iridescent purple that shimmered like jewels. It danced just out of reach, teasing her, pulling her further across the lawn towards the edge of the woods.

""I'm gonna get you!"" she laughed, her voice clear and bright, losing the high-pitched lisp of early childhood.

She reached out, her fingers long and slender, brushing the air. She was so close. She could almost feel the wind from its wings.

Suddenly, she stopped.

The laughter cut off as if a switch had been flipped on a circuit board.

Her hand flew to her chest, clutching the delicate lace of her dress. Her eyes went wide, the joy replaced instantly by confusion, then a profound, instinctual terror.

She swayed. The world spun around her. The blue sky, the green grass, the purple butterfly—it all blurred into a kaleidoscope of pain and vertigo.

She fell.

She hit the soft grass with a thud. The butterfly fluttered away, unheeded, returning to the safety of the trees.

Her heart, born with a congenital defect no healer in this primitive world had the knowledge to detect, stuttered. It beat once. Twice. A frantic, irregular rhythm, like a bird trapped in a cage.

And then it stopped.

The world went grey for her. The sound of the wind in the trees faded to silence. The warmth of the sun evaporated.

*Mama?* she thought, the word forming in her mind, but the neural pathways required to speak it were already shutting down.

She was gone. The vessel was empty. The lights were on, but the user had logged off.

And then, the blue light crashed down.

It wasn't a gentle light. It wasn't a ray of sunshine. It was a bolt of jagged, neon lightning, a tear in the fabric of the world that smelled of ozone and burnt sugar. It slammed into the still body lying in the grass with the force of a thunderclap.

The air crackled with raw magic and displaced static. The grass around her scorched in a perfect circle, turning to ash in an instant.

The body jerked. A violent, unnatural spasm, like a marionette having its strings yanked by a manic puppeteer.

And then, the eyes opened.

They weren't the soft, sky-blue eyes of a ten-year-old girl anymore. They were wide, terrified, and filled with the cold, hard logic of a man who had just watched his own death.

# Chapter 0x01: Reboot

Pain.

That is the first data point.

It isn't the crushing, explosive pain of the heart attack that ended my previous existence. It isn't the sensation of an elephant sitting on my chest. This is different. It is a dull, throbbing ache that permeates every inch of my being, like the hum of a server room that vibrates in your teeth. My head feels like it is stuffed with wet cotton wool, heavy and disconnected from the rest of me. My limbs feel... wrong. Too light. The leverage is off. The proprioception—the body's internal sense of position in space—is throwing up a cascade of error messages.

*System check,* I think groggily, my internal monologue automatic and detached. *Status report. What is the uptime?*

I try to open my eyes. The lids feel heavy, glued shut with sleep or something stickier. Rheum? Tears?

""Nia! Nia, please!""

The voice is deep, rough with emotion. A man's voice. It sounds terrified, the kind of raw, unfiltered fear that scrapes against the soul. It is too loud, booming in my sensitive ears.

*Who is Nia?*

The name means nothing to me. I am Adrion. I am a developer. I live in apartment 4B. I drive a 2015 Honda Civic. I am... dead?

The memory of the office, the pain, the Void—it all rushes back in a fragmented, terrifying montage. I gasp, my lungs inflating with a sudden, sharp intake of air.

I force my eyes open.

The light is blinding. A harsh, white assault that makes me wince and squeeze them shut again. It isn't the cool artificial glow of my monitors. It is sunlight—raw, unfiltered, aggressive sunlight. I blink rapidly, tears leaking from the corners of my eyes, trying to force the iris to adjust, trying to clear the blur.

A face swims into view.

It is a man. He is close, leaning over me, filling my field of vision. He has a beard, trimmed but thick, the color of dark oak with flecks of grey. Worry lines are etched deep into his forehead, looking like geological strata. His eyes are red-rimmed, swollen, as if he hasn't slept in days.

He is wearing... a tunic?

My brain tries to parse the visual input. It looks like something out of a history book or a high-budget LARP convention. High-quality fabric, dark green velvet that catches the light, with an embroidered collar of silver thread depicting stylized wolves.

""Oh, thank the Gods,"" the man breathes, his shoulders sagging as if a great weight has been lifted. The tension leaves his frame so visibly it is like watching a pressurized valve release. Tears well in his eyes, spilling over onto his cheeks and getting lost in his beard. ""She's awake. Elara! She's awake!""

I try to speak. I want to ask who he is, where I am, why I am not dead at my desk in Seattle. I want to ask for water. I want to ask for a doctor.

""Wha...""

My voice.

It isn't my voice.

It isn't the deep, slightly raspy baritone of a 25-year-old man who smokes too much, drinks too much coffee, and speaks too little.

It is high. Pitchy. Thin. The voice of a child.

I freeze. The panic that has been simmering in my gut boils over, turning into a silent scream that gets stuck in my throat. The heart rate monitor in my brain spikes. I try to sit up, but my body betrays me. I am weak, trembling like a leaf in a storm. The muscles refuse to fire correctly; the strength-to-weight ratio is completely different from what my brain expects.

I look down at my hands, which are resting on the heavy, embroidered quilt.

They are small.

Pale. Soft. Unblemished.

There are no calluses from years of typing. No ink stain on the middle finger from my favorite pen. No small, jagged scar on the thumb from that time I cut myself opening an Amazon package three years ago.

These are not the hands of a software developer. These are the hands of a young girl.

*No.*

*No, no, no. This is a glitch. This is a rendering error.*

I look around, desperate for context, for something familiar to anchor me to reality. I am in a bed, but not my IKEA Malm bed. This is a four-poster monstrosity of dark, polished wood, with heavy velvet curtains tied back with gold tassels. The room is made of stone—actual, quarried stone blocks. The walls are covered in tapestries depicting hunting scenes: stags fleeing from hounds, knights on horseback. A fireplace crackles in the corner, consuming thick logs and casting dancing shadows on the high, beamed ceiling.

There are no monitors. No hum of a server rack. No LED lights blinking in the darkness. No traffic noise from the street below.

""Nia?"" The man reaches out, his large, calloused hand gently cupping my cheek. His skin is rough, like worn leather, but his touch is incredibly gentle, terrified of breaking me. ""Can you hear me, little bird?""

I flinch away from his touch. The action is instinctual, born of pure terror and the violation of personal space.

The man looks hurt, pulling his hand back as if burned. The hope in his eyes fractures. ""Nia?""

""Who..."" I rasp, the word feeling foreign on my tongue. My throat is dry, scratchy, as if I have swallowed a handful of sand. ""Who are you?""

The man's face crumbles. The relief vanishes, replaced by a fresh wave of anguish so potent it is painful to watch. ""Nia... it's me. Papa.""

*Papa?*

My father died ten years ago. Pancreatic cancer. It was slow, painful, and messy. I held his hand when he passed in a sterile hospital room that smelled of antiseptic. This man is a stranger. A cosplaying stranger.

And yet...

Looking at him, a strange sensation washes over me. It isn't a memory, not exactly. It is more like a feeling, a ghost of an emotion that isn't mine. Warmth. Safety. The sensation of being lifted high in the air by strong arms. The smell of pine and old parchment. The scratch of a beard against a soft cheek during a bedtime story.

*Nia.*

The name flashes in my mind like a variable assignment.

`const currentIdentity = ""Nia"";`

I squeeze my eyes shut, pressing the heels of my hands against them until sparks fly. *I'm hallucinating. I'm in a coma. The heart attack didn't kill me; it stroked me out. This is a dream. A very vivid, very messed up dream constructed by a dying brain.*

""Get the healer!"" the man—Papa?—barks at someone I can't see, his voice cracking with authority and fear. ""She's confused. The seizure must have... the fever...""

Seizure? Fever?

I take a deep breath, trying to steady my racing heart. The air smells of woodsmoke, lavender, and something medicinal. Poultices. It is too real. Dreams don't smell this distinct. Dreams don't have this level of texture—the scratchiness of the wool blanket, the cold draft hitting my neck.

>

It is absurd. It is statistically impossible. It is the plot of a dozen anime shows I've watched to unwind after a long sprint. *Isekai.* That's what they call it. Trashy power fantasies where the loser protagonist gets hit by a truck and wakes up with a harem.

But I am not a loser protagonist. I am a senior dev. And I don't have a harem; I have a terrified bearded man and a body that feels like it is made of glass.

I open my eyes again. The man is still watching me, fear and hope warring in his expression. He looks like he is waiting for a verdict.

If this is real... if I am really a child named Nia... then Adrion is dead.

The realization hits me with the force of a physical blow to the stomach. My life. My work. My apartment with the view of the Space Needle. My Steam library. My unfinished code. My mother, who will get a call from the police finding my body.

Gone. Deleted. Formatted.

""Nia?""

I look at the man. **Baron Aldric von Eisenwald.**

The name surfaces from the depths of the child's brain I now inhabit, like a file being retrieved from a deep, dusty archive. Along with the name comes metadata: *Father. Protector. Strong. Kind. Eisenwald. Home.*

""I..."" I swallow, forcing the lump in my throat down. I need to play along. If I start screaming about computers and heart attacks and Seattle, they'll think I am possessed. In a medieval setting, ""possessed"" usually means exorcism, which usually means pain, or burning at the stake. I am not keen on dying twice in one week.

""I'm... tired,"" I whisper. It isn't a lie. My new body feels like it is made of lead. The simple act of sitting up has drained a battery I didn't know I had.

Aldric lets out a breath he seems to have been holding for hours. His shoulders slump. ""It's alright. You're safe. You're safe now, my little bird.""

He leans in and kisses my forehead. His beard scratches my skin, a sensation that triggers a confusing mix of revulsion (from Adrion, a grown man being kissed by another man) and comfort (from Nia, a child being comforted by her father).

""Rest. Papa is here. I won't let anything harm you.""

I close my eyes, but sleep is the furthest thing from my mind.

*System Reboot Successful,* I think bitterly. *Welcome to Hell.*

I lie there, listening to the crackle of the fire and the sound of my own breathing—shallow, rapid, terrified. I am a stranger in a strange land, trapped in a body that isn't mine, with a father I don't know, in a world that smells of smoke and unwashed stone.

And I have absolutely no documentation.

I move my hand under the covers, pinching the soft flesh of my thigh. Hard.

It hurts.

*Not a dream.*

I stifle a sob. I am alone. Truly, completely alone. Adrion is gone, and I am just the ghost haunting his replacement.

I don't know what happened, but the navigation in my 2024 GT Line SUCKED!  The time estimates were WAY off, wasn't tracking the vehicle properly at all, it was 100ft off at one point, and it tried to turn me down one way streets more than once and make a left turn on a divided road a bunch of times!  Switched to google and it navigated properly.    
Also, it doesn't register Tesla charging stations as chargers so it doesn't automatically start conditioning.

I don't know what's up with EA chargers, but since about mid-October I have nothing but problems with them.  To the point where if EA chargers are my only option on a trip, we take the coal burner instead.  Our gas car is in the shop so we had no choice this time.  Went to Green River, UT where the only good charger for miles is on the side of this coffee shop with NOTHING AROUND!  2x 350, and 2x 150.  One of the 350 would connect, but would stop the session immediately.  Tried 4x before we moved to the other one.  That one wouldn't even connect, it just sat there.  Ended up charging on the 150.  
Went to Walmart in Provo and similar issue where the charger wouldn't detect it being connected.  3 of the 4 had issues.  We went back the next day and there was a line of about 10 cars waiting to be charged.  Had to drive 30min the wrong direction to a Chargepoint before we could head home.

I've had the issue with the session stopping right away several times in the past, but not connecting at all is new, anyone know what's up?

I just published my first novel, Code and Crown.

The Premise: Adrion was a Systems Architect in Seattle until he died at his desk. He wakes up as Nia, a frail noble girl in a fantasy world. But instead of a game menu, he realizes that Magic in this world operates on logic and syntax.

If you like Hard Magic Systems, this series treats spells like scripts. The protagonist has to optimize mana usage, debug spells, and fix memory leaks in reality.

It features:

* Kingdom Building: Using modern engineering to fix a failing medieval economy.
* Rationalist Protagonist: Problems are solved with logic/coding, not just ""power of friendship.""
* Gender Bender: Dealing with the dysphoria of a 25-year-old man in a young girl's body. (Note: This is handled as a serious, integral part of the character arc, not for comedy).

# Prologue: Fatal Exception

The cursor blinked.

That was the only movement in the room. A steady, rhythmic pulse of white against the obsidian void of the Integrated Development Environment. Blink. Blink. Blink. It was a hypnotic metronome, counting down the seconds of a life that was rapidly running out of runtime.

I stared at it, my eyes burning as if someone had rubbed crushed glass into them. The dry, gritty sensation was familiar—a constant companion for the last three years of my career at Nexus Logistics Solutions. The digital clock in the bottom right corner of my secondary monitor—a glowing red accusation—read 3:47 AM.

I had been awake for... what? Twenty hours? Twenty-two? The integers were fuzzy, swimming in a sea of lukewarm energy drinks and profound cellular exhaustion. The deployment was due at 8:00 AM sharp. The client, a massive trans-continental shipping firm with more venture capital than common sense, had decided that migrating their entire legacy database over a holiday weekend was a brilliant strategic maneuver.

It wasn't. It was a suicide mission.

The backend migration was a disaster of biblical proportions. It wasn't just bad code; it was a crime scene. I was looking at a tangled mess of spaghetti code, undocumented dependencies, and variable names that looked like someone had smashed their face against a keyboard in a fit of rage. tempVar1, doTheThing, pleaseWork, dont\_touch\_this\_legacy\_garbage.

I was the only one left in the office—well, my home office in Seattle. The rain lashed against the windowpane, a relentless grey static that matched the fuzz in my brain. My ""team"" had logged off hours ago, citing family commitments or simply ghosting the Slack channel. I was the senior lead. I was the one with the ""ownership mindset."" I was the one who understood enough of the archaic, rusted-out architecture to keep the whole precarious tower from crashing down into the digital abyss.

""Just one more function,"" I muttered, my voice raspy and unused. It sounded like dry autumn leaves scraping over concrete. ""Fix the race condition in the user authentication module, and then... then I can sleep.""

I reached for the can of Hyper-Volt on my desk, my fingers trembling slightly. A tremor. That was new. Or maybe it wasn't. Maybe I just hadn't noticed it through the haze of sleep deprivation and the constant, low-level anxiety that hummed in my veins like a faulty power line.

My hand brushed the aluminum can. It was light. Too light. I knocked it over, and it clattered to the hardwood floor, the hollow metallic sound ringing out like a gunshot in the silent apartment. It rolled away, spinning in a slow, mocking circle, leaking the last few drops of neon-yellow chemical sludge onto the floorboards.

I didn't pick it up. I couldn't.

My arm felt heavy, impossibly heavy, as if gravity had suddenly decided to focus all its malice on my right limb. It felt like it was made of lead, encased in wet concrete. A dull ache began to radiate from my shoulder, a cold creeping numbness that defied the stuffy heat of the room.

Focus, Adrion. Focus. You can sleep when the commit is pushed. You can sleep when the pipeline is green.

I forced my hand back to the mechanical keyboard. The keys, usually a source of tactile comfort with their crisp clack-clack-clack, felt cold and hard under my fingertips. I typed a line of code, each keystroke a monumental effort of will, sending a signal down a nervous system that was rapidly degrading.

if (user.hasPermission(ADMIN\_OVERRIDE)) {

My chest tightened.

It wasn't a gradual ache. It wasn't the slow burn of heartburn from too much pizza. It was a sharp, sudden squeeze, like a giant, invisible vice clamping down on my ribcage. The air was punched out of my lungs in a violent rush. I gasped, a wet, desperate sound, but no air came back in. My diaphragm had locked up. My fingers froze over the keyboard, hovering over the keys like paralyzed spiders.

The ""developer's crunch"" was a known occupational hazard. We joked about it. Eat right, exercise, stand up every hour. I hadn't stood up in six hours. I hadn't eaten a vegetable in three days. But this... this was different. This wasn't anxiety. This wasn't a panic attack.

This was a hardware failure.

The room tilted violently to the left. The glow of the monitors—usually a comforting, cool blue light—smeared into aggressive streaks of neon and blinding white. The hum of my computer fans, usually a white noise I ignored, roared in my ears like a jet engine taking off inside my skull.

Panic.

It surged through me, cold and electric, overriding the logic centers of my brain. I tried to stand up, to push my Herman Miller chair back, to reach for my phone on the desk. Call 911. Call Mom. Call anyone.

But my legs wouldn't obey. The signal from my brain was lost in transit, severed by the catastrophic failure occurring in my chest. Packet loss: 100%.

I slumped forward. My forehead hit the cool plastic of the keyboard with a dull thud.

jkl;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The keys clattered under the dead weight of my head, a meaningless stream of characters filling the screen, injecting garbage data into the critical function I was trying to save.

The pain exploded. It wasn't just in my chest anymore. It was a supernova, radiating down my left arm, shooting up into my jaw, exploding behind my eyes. It was a white-hot lance of agony that obliterated thought, obliterated fear, obliterated the deadline.

I couldn't breathe. I couldn't think. I couldn't exist.

Is this it?

The thought was strangely detached, floating above the sea of pain like a solitary lifeboat.

Am I dying?

I didn't finish the migration. The client is going to be furious.

The absurdity of the thought almost made me laugh, but my diaphragm was paralyzed. I was dying, alone in a dark apartment, and my last regret was uncommitted code for a logistics company that would replace me before my obituary was printed.

Darkness rushed in from the edges of my vision. It wasn't a fading to black; it was a physical presence, a cold, oily tide swallowing the code, the room, the pain. It rushed into my ears, silencing the roar of the fans. It rushed into my mind, erasing the logic, the syntax, the self.

And then, there was nothing.

No light. No sound. No Adrion.

Just the Void.

But in the Void, something flickered.

I saw it. Not with eyes—I didn't have eyes anymore—but with pure, stripped-down consciousness.

A screen.

A massive, translucent interface hovering in the nothingness. It was vast, stretching to infinity, glowing with a harsh, command-line green that reminded me of the old CRT monitors from the 90s.

    **SYSTEM ERROR: UNHANDLED EXCEPTION.**
    **ERROR CODE: 0xDEADDEAD.**
    **ATTEMPTING RECOVERY...**
    

Recovery? The concept floated in the void, untethered from language. Who is recovering? There is no backup. There is no redundancy.

    **DESTINATION NOT FOUND. REROUTING...**
    **SEARCHING FOR COMPATIBLE HOST...**
    

Lines of code scrolled past at impossible speeds. Hexadecimal strings, memory addresses, soul signatures. It was looking for a variable container that matched my data type.

    **HOST FOUND: NIA_VON_EISENWALD [STATUS: CRITICAL FAILURE]**
    **INITIATING SOUL TRANSFER PROTOCOL...**
    

Wait. What? Nia? Who is—

    **TRANSFER COMPLETE.**
    

Thousands of miles away—or perhaps worlds away, across the membrane of reality where the math of the universe breaks down and becomes magic—a garden bloomed.

It was a beautiful day in the Eisenwald. The sun was a warm, golden coin in a sky of perfect azure, a stark contrast to the rainy grey of Seattle. The air smelled of blooming roses, freshly cut grass, and the crisp scent of pine from the nearby mountains.

A girl was running.

She was ten years old, poised on that fragile, gangly threshold between childhood and adolescence. Her hair was the color of spun gold, catching the sunlight as it flew behind her in a tangled wave. She was tall for her age, her limbs long and coltish, clad in a white lace dress that was stained green at the knees—a testament to a tomboyish energy that defied her noble attire.

""Nia! Slow down!"" a woman's voice called from the stone terrace. It was a warm voice, filled with love and a hint of maternal worry.

But Nia didn't listen. She was chasing a butterfly. A magnificent creature with wings of iridescent purple that shimmered like jewels. It danced just out of reach, teasing her, pulling her further across the lawn towards the edge of the woods.

""I'm gonna get you!"" she laughed, her voice clear and bright, losing the high-pitched lisp of early childhood.

She reached out, her fingers long and slender, brushing the air. She was so close. She could almost feel the wind from its wings.

Suddenly, she stopped.

The laughter cut off as if a switch had been flipped on a circuit board.

Her hand flew to her chest, clutching the delicate lace of her dress. Her eyes went wide, the joy replaced instantly by confusion, then a profound, instinctual terror.

She swayed. The world spun around her. The blue sky, the green grass, the purple butterfly—it all blurred into a kaleidoscope of pain and vertigo.

She fell.

She hit the soft grass with a thud. The butterfly fluttered away, unheeded, returning to the safety of the trees.

Her heart, born with a congenital defect no healer in this primitive world had the knowledge to detect, stuttered. It beat once. Twice. A frantic, irregular rhythm, like a bird trapped in a cage.

And then it stopped.

The world went grey for her. The sound of the wind in the trees faded to silence. The warmth of the sun evaporated.

Mama? she thought, the word forming in her mind, but the neural pathways required to speak it were already shutting down.

She was gone. The vessel was empty. The lights were on, but the user had logged off.

And then, the blue light crashed down.

It wasn't a gentle light. It wasn't a ray of sunshine. It was a bolt of jagged, neon lightning, a tear in the fabric of the world that smelled of ozone and burnt sugar. It slammed into the still body lying in the grass with the force of a thunderclap.

The air crackled with raw magic and displaced static. The grass around her scorched in a perfect circle, turning to ash in an instant.

The body jerked. A violent, unnatural spasm, like a marionette having its strings yanked by a manic puppeteer.

And then, the eyes opened.

They weren't the soft, sky-blue eyes of a ten-year-old girl anymore. They were wide, terrified, and filled with the cold, hard logic of a man who had just watched his own death.

# Chapter 0x01: Reboot

Pain.

That is the first data point.

It isn't the crushing, explosive pain of the heart attack that ended my previous existence. It isn't the sensation of an elephant sitting on my chest. This is different. It is a dull, throbbing ache that permeates every inch of my being, like the hum of a server room that vibrates in your teeth. My head feels like it is stuffed with wet cotton wool, heavy and disconnected from the rest of me. My limbs feel... wrong. Too light. The leverage is off. The proprioception—the body's internal sense of position in space—is throwing up a cascade of error messages.

System check, I think groggily, my internal monologue automatic and detached. Status report. What is the uptime?

I try to open my eyes. The lids feel heavy, glued shut with sleep or something stickier. Rheum? Tears?

""Nia! Nia, please!""

The voice is deep, rough with emotion. A man's voice. It sounds terrified, the kind of raw, unfiltered fear that scrapes against the soul. It is too loud, booming in my sensitive ears.

Who is Nia?

The name means nothing to me. I am Adrion. I am a developer. I live in apartment 4B. I drive a 2015 Honda Civic. I am... dead?

The memory of the office, the pain, the Void—it all rushes back in a fragmented, terrifying montage. I gasp, my lungs inflating with a sudden, sharp intake of air.

I force my eyes open.

The light is blinding. A harsh, white assault that makes me wince and squeeze them shut again. It isn't the cool artificial glow of my monitors. It is sunlight—raw, unfiltered, aggressive sunlight. I blink rapidly, tears leaking from the corners of my eyes, trying to force the iris to adjust, trying to clear the blur.

A face swims into view.

It is a man. He is close, leaning over me, filling my field of vision. He has a beard, trimmed but thick, the color of dark oak with flecks of grey. Worry lines are etched deep into his forehead, looking like geological strata. His eyes are red-rimmed, swollen, as if he hasn't slept in days.

He is wearing... a tunic?

My brain tries to parse the visual input. It looks like something out of a history book or a high-budget LARP convention. High-quality fabric, dark green velvet that catches the light, with an embroidered collar of silver thread depicting stylized wolves.

""Oh, thank the Gods,"" the man breathes, his shoulders sagging as if a great weight has been lifted. The tension leaves his frame so visibly it is like watching a pressurized valve release. Tears well in his eyes, spilling over onto his cheeks and getting lost in his beard. ""She's awake. Elara! She's awake!""

I try to speak. I want to ask who he is, where I am, why I am not dead at my desk in Seattle. I want to ask for water. I want to ask for a doctor.

""Wha...""

My voice.

It isn't my voice.

It isn't the deep, slightly raspy baritone of a 25-year-old man who smokes too much, drinks too much coffee, and speaks too little.

It is high. Pitchy. Thin. The voice of a child.

I freeze. The panic that has been simmering in my gut boils over, turning into a silent scream that gets stuck in my throat. The heart rate monitor in my brain spikes. I try to sit up, but my body betrays me. I am weak, trembling like a leaf in a storm. The muscles refuse to fire correctly; the strength-to-weight ratio is completely different from what my brain expects.

I look down at my hands, which are resting on the heavy, embroidered quilt.

They are small.

Pale. Soft. Unblemished.

There are no calluses from years of typing. No ink stain on the middle finger from my favorite pen. No small, jagged scar on the thumb from that time I cut myself opening an Amazon package three years ago.

These are not the hands of a software developer. These are the hands of a young girl.

No.

No, no, no. This is a glitch. This is a rendering error.

I look around, desperate for context, for something familiar to anchor me to reality. I am in a bed, but not my IKEA Malm bed. This is a four-poster monstrosity of dark, polished wood, with heavy velvet curtains tied back with gold tassels. The room is made of stone—actual, quarried stone blocks. The walls are covered in tapestries depicting hunting scenes: stags fleeing from hounds, knights on horseback. A fireplace crackles in the corner, consuming thick logs and casting dancing shadows on the high, beamed ceiling.

There are no monitors. No hum of a server rack. No LED lights blinking in the darkness. No traffic noise from the street below.

""Nia?"" The man reaches out, his large, calloused hand gently cupping my cheek. His skin is rough, like worn leather, but his touch is incredibly gentle, terrified of breaking me. ""Can you hear me, little bird?""

I flinch away from his touch. The action is instinctual, born of pure terror and the violation of personal space.

The man looks hurt, pulling his hand back as if burned. The hope in his eyes fractures. ""Nia?""

""Who..."" I rasp, the word feeling foreign on my tongue. My throat is dry, scratchy, as if I have swallowed a handful of sand. ""Who are you?""

The man's face crumbles. The relief vanishes, replaced by a fresh wave of anguish so potent it is painful to watch. ""Nia... it's me. Papa.""

Papa?

My father died ten years ago. Pancreatic cancer. It was slow, painful, and messy. I held his hand when he passed in a sterile hospital room that smelled of antiseptic. This man is a stranger. A cosplaying stranger.

And yet...

Looking at him, a strange sensation washes over me. It isn't a memory, not exactly. It is more like a feeling, a ghost of an emotion that isn't mine. Warmth. Safety. The sensation of being lifted high in the air by strong arms. The smell of pine and old parchment. The scratch of a beard against a soft cheek during a bedtime story.

Nia.

The name flashes in my mind like a variable assignment.

const currentIdentity = ""Nia"";

I squeeze my eyes shut, pressing the heels of my hands against them until sparks fly. I'm hallucinating. I'm in a coma. The heart attack didn't kill me; it stroked me out. This is a dream. A very vivid, very messed up dream constructed by a dying brain.

""Get the healer!"" the man—Papa?—barks at someone I can't see, his voice cracking with authority and fear. ""She's confused. The seizure must have... the fever...""

Seizure? Fever?

I take a deep breath, trying to steady my racing heart. The air smells of woodsmoke, lavender, and something medicinal. Poultices. It is too real. Dreams don't smell this distinct. Dreams don't have this level of texture—the scratchiness of the wool blanket, the cold draft hitting my neck.

>

It is absurd. It is statistically impossible. It is the plot of a dozen anime shows I've watched to unwind after a long sprint. Isekai. That's what they call it. Trashy power fantasies where the loser protagonist gets hit by a truck and wakes up with a harem.

But I am not a loser protagonist. I am a senior dev. And I don't have a harem; I have a terrified bearded man and a body that feels like it is made of glass.

I open my eyes again. The man is still watching me, fear and hope warring in his expression. He looks like he is waiting for a verdict.

If this is real... if I am really a child named Nia... then Adrion is dead.

The realization hits me with the force of a physical blow to the stomach. My life. My work. My apartment with the view of the Space Needle. My Steam library. My unfinished code. My mother, who will get a call from the police finding my body.

Gone. Deleted. Formatted.

""Nia?""

I look at the man. Baron Aldric von Eisenwald.

The name surfaces from the depths of the child's brain I now inhabit, like a file being retrieved from a deep, dusty archive. Along with the name comes metadata: Father. Protector. Strong. Kind. Eisenwald. Home.

""I..."" I swallow, forcing the lump in my throat down. I need to play along. If I start screaming about computers and heart attacks and Seattle, they'll think I am possessed. In a medieval setting, ""possessed"" usually means exorcism, which usually means pain, or burning at the stake. I am not keen on dying twice in one week.

""I'm... tired,"" I whisper. It isn't a lie. My new body feels like it is made of lead. The simple act of sitting up has drained a battery I didn't know I had.

Aldric lets out a breath he seems to have been holding for hours. His shoulders slump. ""It's alright. You're safe. You're safe now, my little bird.""

He leans in and kisses my forehead. His beard scratches my skin, a sensation that triggers a confusing mix of revulsion (from Adrion, a grown man being kissed by another man) and comfort (from Nia, a child being comforted by her father).

""Rest. Papa is here. I won't let anything harm you.""

I close my eyes, but sleep is the furthest thing from my mind.

System Reboot Successful, I think bitterly. Welcome to Hell.

I lie there, listening to the crackle of the fire and the sound of my own breathing—shallow, rapid, terrified. I am a stranger in a strange land, trapped in a body that isn't mine, with a father I don't know, in a world that smells of smoke and unwashed stone.

And I have absolutely no documentation.

I move my hand under the covers, pinching the soft flesh of my thigh. Hard.

It hurts.

Not a dream.

1pgbni5,https://i.redd.it/n99xpkck9q5g1.jpeg,The Dark Weight of Nostalgia in Twin Peaks: The Return,"This is just my own understanding of what Lynch might be doing in The Return.

Nostalgia feels comforting, but in Twin Peaks: The Return, Lynch shows how fragile that comfort really is. We come back to the forests, the coffee, the cherry pie, but the town no longer feels bright or innocent. Twin Peaks looks older and spiritually tired.

The characters reflect this change. Bobby Briggs, once a reckless villain, is now calm and responsible, while new figures like Red feel far more dangerous than anything from the original series. Even Shelly finds herself caught in relationships that seem darker than anything from her past. And Benjamin Horne, who once chased every temptation, now refuses to get involved with a woman who is cheating on her seriously ill husband. The old villains suddenly look almost harmless next to the new ones.

The moment that struck me most is the girl in the car while her mom keeps honking. It’s just pure human suffering, uncomfortable in a way that feels very real. It looks a lot like the kind of pain and confusion we see in the world today.

It makes me wonder if Lynch is pointing to the present, suggesting that our world today has become darker and more confusing, and that nostalgia only highlights the gap between what we remember and what we now face.

In The Return, nostalgia becomes a double edged knife. It comforts us with familiar names, faces, and places, but cuts us with the realization that those comforts no longer work. Twin Peaks is not just a town, it is a mirror. One side reflects the world we long for, the other the world we have inherited.

And somewhere between the forests and the coffee cups, Lynch whispers the truth.

Madison

I lifted my gaze from the computer screen as the elevator dinged. A woman in a red dress strutted toward me, her heels clicking against the marble floor like a timer counting down to chaos.

""I'm here to see Alexander."" She planted her manicured hands on my desk, leaning forward with a smile that didn't reach her eyes.

""Do you have an appointment?""

""I don't need one. We have... history. Just tell Shim Vanessa's here.""

""I'm sorry, but Mr. Knight only takes scheduled appointments. I can help you set one up for next week-""

""Listen here, little secretary."" She interrupted. ""I'm Vanessa Caldwell. I spent the night with Alexander last weekend, and I'm not leaving until I see him.""

""As I mentioned, without an appointment or express permission from Mr. Knight-""

""Who do you think you are? Just because you stand next to him all day, fetching his coffee and taking notes, you think you're special?""

""Ma'am, I need to ask you to leave-""

""You're pathetic. Playing gatekeeper, pretending you matter. I bet you fantasize about him noticing you, don't you? Honey, even if you spread those thighs on his desk, he wouldn't give you a second glance. He needs a real woman, not some desperate little assistant playing dress-up in her Target blazer.""

""Security will escort you out if necessary.""

""You wouldn't dare. Do you know who my father is? I could have your job with one phone call.""

""And I could remove you from the premises with one button."" I placed my hand near the security alert under my desk. ""Your choice, Ms. Caldwell.""

Vanessa's face contorted with rage. In one fluid motion, she snatched the water pitcher from my desk and emptied its contents over my head. Ice-cold water drenched my hair, makeup, and brand-new blouse – for the record, it wasn't from Target.

""Oops."" She smirked, dropping the empty pitcher on my keyboard with a clatter. ""Looks like someone needs a towel.""

But before I could process my next move, the elevator dinged again.

Alexander Knight stepped out, filling the lobby like a storm front. His easy stride faltered as he took in the scene - me looking like a drowned rat, Vanessa preening like a cat who'd gotten the cream, and water pooling across my desk and expensive electronics.

""Well."" His voice cut through the tension. ""This is certainly not the greeting I expected.""

Vanessa's face lit up. ""Alexander, darling! I was just-""

""Assaulting my PA and damaging company property?"" He crossed to us in three strides. ""Bold strategy.""

""I was simply having a conversation with your PA."" Her voice dripped honey while her eyes stabbed mine. ""She refused to let me see you.""

""Because that's her job."" Alexander handed me his monogrammed handkerchief. His touch sent an unwanted tingle up my arm. ""Miss Harper follows my protocols to the letter. That's why she's invaluable.""

I dabbed at my face, grateful I'd worn waterproof mascara today. The handkerchief smelled like his cologne – a detail I wasn't focusing on.

""But darling,"" Vanessa stepped closer to Alexander, her hip swaying. ""After our magical night together-""

""You mean the charity gala where you had too much champagne, and I called you a cab? That was hardly magical, though I hear you've been telling a different version around town.""

I bit my lip to hide my smile.

""I-"" Vanessa gaped like a fish.

""Now,"" Alexander's hand came to rest on my shoulder, and I prayed he couldn't feel how my pulse jumped. ""You've just assaulted my favorite employee and probably destroyed about ten thousand dollars worth of equipment. Would you like me to call security or the cops?""

I felt my cheeks heat at my 'favorite employee.' He was always like this—charming, flirtatious, and making everyone feel special. It didn't mean anything.

""You wouldn't dare."" But Vanessa's confidence wavered.

""Try me. I protect my people, especially those who keep my life running smoothly. In fact, I should ban you from the building entirely. What do you think, Miss Harper?""

""I think that sounds reasonable, Mr. Knight."" I stayed professional despite his touch warming me.

Vanessa's face cycled through fifty shades of red. ""This is ridiculous. You'll regret this. Both of you will.""

""The only thing I regret is not having my phone out to record this tantrum. Security's on their way up. I suggest you leave before they arrive.""

""My father will hear about this!""

""I'm sure he will. Give Charles my regards. Tell him his company's stock is looking shaky these days.""

As soon as the elevator doors closed on her scowling face, Alexander's hand left my shoulder, and I immediately missed its warmth – a thought I quickly shoved into my brain's 'do not examine' folder.

I stood from my chair, water dripping onto the floor.

""Are you alright?"" Alexander's brow furrowed as he assessed the damage. ""She didn't hurt you, did she?""

""Just my pride. And maybe my electronics."" I poked at my waterlogged keyboard, which responded with an alarming spark.

""Leave that. I'll have IT bring up replacements."" He pulled out his phone. ""John can get you to the mall in fifteen minutes. Use the company card to pick up whatever you need—clothes, makeup, hair products.""

""Thank you, Mr. Knight, but it's no big deal. My shift ends in an hour, and I have a prior engagement after work.""

""You're going to sit in wet clothes for another hour?""

""I'll manage,"" I insisted with a smile. ""But I appreciate the offer.""

He gave me a look that said he didn't believe me but nodded anyway.

I pushed open the door to the restaurant, ready for a relaxing dinner with Hazel after my disaster of a day. The hostess led me toward our usual corner booth, but I stopped short. Instead of just my best friend, a man sat beside her.

""Mads!"" Hazel bounced up, waving like I might miss her in the half-empty restaurant. ""You made it! Come meet Derek!""

I forced a smile and sat across from them. Of course, Hazel would ambush me with a surprise blind date after the day I'd had.

""Mads, this is Derek. He's a financial analyst, and I met him at that yoga retreat last month."" Hazel's eyes sparkled with matchmaking glee. ""Derek, meet my best friend Madison.""

""Pleasure."" Derek flashed perfectly whitened teeth. ""Hazel told me so much about you.""

I resisted the urge to kick Hazel under the table. ""All good things, I hope?""

We fumbled through awkward small talk about the weather and restaurant specials until Derek excused himself to the restroom.

The moment he was out of earshot, Hazel pounced. ""Isn't he dreamy? Those shoulders! And he's so successful - you should see his condo downtown.""

""Haze...""

""Come on, when did you last go on a real date? You work too hard, sweetie. Everyone needs someone to lean on.""

""I'm fine on my own right now. With Mom's treatments and everything...""

""How is she doing?"" Hazel's expression softened.

""The same. The new medication is expensive, but..."" I shrugged.

""And that brother of yours is still MIA?"" Hazel's face darkened. ""What a selfish asshole, leaving you to handle everything alone.""

""I don't want to talk about him. Mom worked three jobs to raise us. The least I can do is help her now.""

Derek slid back into the booth, adjusting his designer tie. ""Sorry about that. Now, where were we?""

""Madison was just telling us about her day at work,"" Hazel chirped.

""Oh, right - you work as a secretary or something?"" Derek asked.

""Personal assistant to Alexander Knight at Knight Industries.""

""Alexander Knight? The CEO?"" He leaned forward, elbows on the table. ""Must be quite the... demanding position.""

""Excuse me?""

""Come on, we all know how these things work."" He winked. ""Beautiful young woman, powerful executive—I'm sure you've found ways to make yourself invaluable to the company.""

Hazel's jaw dropped. ""Derek!""

""What? I'm just saying what everyone thinks when they see these arrangements."" He gestured vaguely at me. ""No judgment here. A girl's got to use her assets.""

""You absolute pig."" Hazel's face flushed red. ""Get out.""

""Hey, I'm just being honest. No need to get defensive-""

""Out!"" Hazel stood up, pointing toward the door. ""Now.""

""Alright, alright. Guess some people can't handle the truth."" He slid out of the booth, adjusting his jacket. ""Call me when you're ready to be real about things.""

We watched him weave between tables toward the exit. Hazel collapsed back into her seat, mortified.

""Oh my god, Mads. I am so, so sorry. I can't believe I thought he was decent. He seemed so nice at yoga!""

""Hey, at least we found out he was trash before the appetizers arrived."" I grabbed the menu, determined to salvage our evening. ""Now, about those loaded nachos we always get...""

""But still! The things he said about you and Mr. Knight!"" She shook her head. ""I feel awful.""

""Forget him. Seriously."" I waved down a waiter. ""The nachos and two margaritas, please. Make mine a double.""

Hazel brightened with mischief. ""Although, maybe Derek had a point. Not about you being - you know - but about Mr. Knight liking you. I've seen the way he looks at you.""

I choked on my water, sputtering. ""What? No! That's - that's impossible. He's my boss!""

""Why not? You're smart, gorgeous, and he's clearly interested.""

""Stop it!"" I grabbed a napkin to wipe my chin. ""It's not like that at all.""

Hazel burst out laughing. ""Relax, I'm kidding! Everyone knows Alexander Knight is Manhattan's most notorious playboy. Different supermodels every week, yacht parties in Monaco."" She leaned forward. ""Just be careful, okay? Don't let that pretty face and charm fool you. Men like him don't do relationships - they collect trophies.""

""Trust me, I know exactly who he is."" My phone buzzed.

I pulled out my phone to check the message. Alexander's name flashed on the screen.

""325 Park Avenue, Penthouse. Come now.""

No explanation, no context. Typical Alexander.

""Everything okay?"" Hazel peered across the table.

""Work."" I grabbed my purse, already sliding out of the booth. ""Rain check on those nachos?""

""Again? This is getting ridiculous. It's almost 8 PM!""

""I know, I know. But-""

""But nothing! You're not his personal servant. You have a life, too. What could possibly be so urgent?""

""It's probably another last-minute networking event. He does this sometimes—invites potential investors over for drinks. Someone has to coordinate with catering and handle the guest list.""

""And that someone always has to be you?""

""It's my job.""

""Your job ended three hours ago."" Hazel's voice softened. ""I worry about you, you know?""

""I know you worry. But this job - the benefits, the salary - it's helping Mom fight. I can't risk losing it.""

""Just be careful, okay?""

I nodded, already halfway to the door. The cool night air hit my face as I flagged down a cab.

The cab wound through Manhattan's glittering streets. Mom's medical bills haunted me, mounting higher each month. I couldn't mess this up. Not when she needed me.

325 Park Avenue loomed ahead, all gleaming glass and steel stretching into the night sky. The doorman nodded as I crossed the marble lobby to the private elevator. My finger hesitated over the penthouse button. Something felt... off.

Usually, when Alexander hosted impromptu gatherings, the lobby buzzed with activity—caterers rushing supplies, guests arriving in designer suits and cocktail dresses. Tonight, there was silence.

My heels clicked against the marble floor as I stepped out, echoing through the empty space. Warm lighting spilled across modern furniture and floor-to-ceiling windows, showcasing the city's sparkle below.

""Mr. Knight?""

No response. Just the soft whir of the central air.

The hair on my neck stood up. Something definitely wasn't right.

A floorboard creaked behind me.

I spun around, heart hammering. Alexander stood there, leaning casually against the doorframe.

He stepped forward, closing the distance between us in three long strides. Before I could react, he had me cornered against the wall, one hand braced beside my head.

# Chapter 2

Madison

His presence was intoxicating. Alexander's cologne wrapped around me, lingering like dark spices and something earthy. My pulse quickened as he leaned in, our faces just inches apart.

""You're here,"" he murmured.

""Mr. Knight, what's going on?"" My voice trembled. I placed a hand on his chest, meaning to push him back, but all I felt was the chiseled muscles under his shirt.

He took my hand, interlacing his fingers with mine and pressing it back against the wall. The heat from his touch was electric, coursing straight to my core. My breathing turned shallow, and my heart thudded in my ears. His eyes were dark, pupils blown wide.

""You're really here."" He whispered huskily. His gaze swept my face, lingering on my lips as his breath warmed my cheek.

""Are you... okay?"" I stammered. His pupils seemed larger than normal, almost swallowing the blue of his irises. Something felt off. Was he on drugs?

""I'm more than okay."" He nuzzled against my neck, lips brushing my skin. ""You're perfect.""

""I think you might need medical assistance—""

He didn't let me finish. His mouth captured mine, and the world tilted on its axis. The kiss was fierce, desperate, and filled with a hunger that took my breath away. His free hand found my waist, pulling me against him. Hard. Unyielding.

The sensible part of my brain screamed for me to push him away, to get help. But then his tongue parted my lips, and my knees went weak. I grabbed onto his shoulders to steady myself, my fingers digging into the fine fabric of his suit.

His kiss grew more intense, leaving me scarcely able to think or breathe. As our tongues entwined, a moan escaped my lips—one I wouldn't have admitted to if questioned.

My hands roamed over his shoulders and back, feeling the hard muscles flex beneath my touch. His grip on my waist tightened, lifting me effortlessly.

Before I knew it, he maneuvered me backward, guiding me toward the bedroom. We stumbled, our lips never parting, until the back of my knees hit the king-sized bed. He gently pushed me onto the mattress, positioning himself above me. His eyes were wild, hungry.

""Off,"" he growled, tugging at my blouse impatiently.

I fumbled with the buttons, my fingers clumsy in their eagerness. Finally, I managed to undo the fabric and slip out of it, my breasts spilling out, my lacy bra doing little to contain them.

His gaze darkened, and he yanked the bra cups down, exposing my hardened nipples to the cool air.

He bent down, taking one nipple into his mouth, sucking hard. I arched up, gasping as his teeth grazed me. His free hand roamed lower, slipping under the waistband of my pants. The moment he found my clit through the thin fabric of my panties, a sharp jolt shot through me.

""Fuck,"" I moaned, my fingers threading through his hair, holding him to my chest.

With one swift motion, he tugged my pants and panties down my legs. The cool air hit my wet pussy, making me shiver. His hands spread my thighs apart, his fingers slipping into my wet heat, pressing inside me. I cried out, hips bucking against his hand.

""You're so fucking wet already,"" he muttered, almost to himself. ""I could take you right here.""

Before I could respond, his fingers withdrew, leaving me aching. I watched, breathless, as he quickly moved to unbuckle his belt and unzip his pants. He didn't bother removing his clothes, but his massive, rock-hard cock sprang free, and my eyes widened at the sight.

He climbed between my legs, positioning the head of his cock at my entrance, teasing me with its thickness. I squirmed, my body screaming for him to fill me.

He thrust into me hard and fast, sheathing himself fully in one brutal stroke. The initial stretch had me seeing stars, but soon, pleasure overwhelmed everything. His cock filled me completely, hitting spots I didn't know existed.

My nails dug into his back as he set a punishing rhythm, each thrust sending waves of ecstasy crashing through me.

His mouth crashed against mine in a desperate, bruising kiss. His hands gripped my hips hard as he pounded into me. Our bodies collided with slick sounds, mingling with our groans and panting breaths.

""God, you're so tight,"" he growled, breath hot and ragged. ""Feels fucking incredible.""

We moved together, our bodies entwined in a primal dance. I felt the pressure building, the peak of my orgasm just within reach. He angled his hips, and the change in depth brought him harder against my G-spot. I cried out, my entire body tensing.

""I'm close, Alexander,"" I gasped, my nails raking down his back.

My voice seemed to spur him on, his movements growing even more frenzied. He thrust into me with a force that had me clutching at the sheets, trying to ground myself against the intense pleasure.

""Yes, fuck, take it all,"" he groaned, his pace becoming erratic. ""Come for me.""

His encouragement drove me over the edge. With a final scream, I shattered, my pussy clenching tight around his cock as waves of orgasm washed over me. I rode out the storm, body convulsing as he continued fucking me through it.

It was then, just as my orgasm began to wane, that I heard him mutter, ""Fuck, Katherine.""

I froze. My mind reeled. Katherine?! Who the hell was Katherine?

But I couldn't dwell on it for long because he was still fucking me, his cock pistoning in and out with savage intensity. My overstimulated body responded despite my confusion, another climax already building.

""Katherine, your pussy is so fucking tight."" He drove into me one last time, spilling inside me with a guttural moan. His body trembled, his release triggering my own. Another orgasm rippled through me, leaving me breathless and shaking.

As the haze of pleasure faded, reality sank in. Alexander had called another woman's name while fucking me. He didn't even know who I was.

As he collapsed next to me on the bed, his breathing heavy, I stared at the ceiling, my mind racing. Who was Katherine? Did she work for him, too, or was she just one of his many conquests? The thought gnawed at me like a persistent itch I couldn't scratch.

I slipped out from under his arm, my legs still trembling. Alexander's soft snores filled the bedroom as I gathered my scattered clothes. Of course, he'd pass out - typical man. At least he hadn't called me ""baby"" or some other generic pet name. No, he'd gone with ""Katherine"" instead.

I stumbled to the bathroom, wincing at my reflection. My carefully straightened hair now resembled a bird's nest, and my lipstick... well, that was definitely not where lipstick should be.

As I cleaned up, my mind wandered to the stack of NDAs in my desk drawer - all the women who'd crossed paths with Alexander Knight.

""At least I didn't have to draft my own NDA,"" I muttered. Being Alexander's PA meant cleaning up his messes and arranging flowers and ""sorry"" gifts for the parade of models and socialites he left in his wake. But Katherine? That name wasn't in any of my files.

I smoothed down my outfit and checked my phone - 10:27 PM. The doctor would still be awake. I scrolled through my contacts, finding Dr. Peterson's number. My thumb hovered over the call button as Alexander's snores echoed from the bedroom.

""Dr. Peterson? Sorry to bother you so late."" I kept my voice steady and professional. Like I hadn't just had mind-blowing sex with my boss. ""It's Madison Harper, Mr. Knight's PA.""

""What's he done now?"" Dr. Peterson sighed.

""He seems altered. Dilated pupils, unusual behavior. I found him like this when I came to drop off some urgent paperwork."" The lie slipped out easily. Too easily.

""Drugs?""

""Possibly. He's sleeping now, but-""

""I'll be there in twenty.""

""Thank you, Doctor."" I ended the call and slipped my phone into my pocket.

Back in the bedroom, Alexander sprawled across the unmade bed like a fallen Greek statue, suit wrinkled and pants still undone.

1pgbg69,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeOS/comments/1pgbg69/in_regards_to_the_accuracy_of_grinders_in_coffeeos/,In regards to the accuracy of grinders in CoffeeOS,"A lot of people have been asking questions about the accuracy of the \[Grinder Converter\], so I thought I'd take a moment to explain, for those who are willing to take the dive.

Particle size is hard. The way we have been looking at it is deceptively simplified. In some ways, ""Medium Fine"" is a great way to communicate grind size, because it is unspecific. But this is also it's problem. If you want to be more specific, you might want to look at its micron size, but not all the particles are the same size. 

  
So usually what you're looking at is the D50, the point where 50% of particles are larger, and 50% are smaller, according to its size distribution. This is not what manufacturers are usually referring to when they're talking about micron size. When they say each setting is 16 microns, it far oversimplifies the physics of what's happening with your grinder. Grinding at the first setting will not result in particles that are all 16µm. Shape matters. The particle size is calculated based on its shape, but it can still be long and flat, slipping through the burrs while being quite large. 

The \[Grinder Converter\] in CoffeeOS is based on general knowledge according to the internet, but often times this just refers to the size of the gap, and not necessarily according to your specific grinder circumstances.

If you want true accuracy, what you really should be doing is using the \[Grinder Manager\] to build your grinder curve according to your actual circumstances, with your burrs, in their current condition.

I did this with my KinuM68.

The system will then estimate the remaining grind settings on your particular grinder, and build you a curve to represent your realistic grind range.

You can see how wonky things get around the coarse end. This is for a couple reasons. One, Because the control really does break down at this point, but also, there's always an element of randomness in how each bean breaks, and the roast degree makes a big difference. But every grind setting you test, the closer you get to a perfect representation of your grinder's capabilities. 

By tapping on any setting that you've tested before, and bringing up the particle analyzer, you will see your distribution testing history.

The grinder you create can then be used in the Grinder Converter.

In the future, CoffeeOS will bring the ability to share grinders and their associated particle distribution data, both privately and publicly, so the community can work to make the \[Grinder Converter\] as accurate as possible for your specific needs.

i’m 23 yo. i would describe myself as warm, intuitive, and a little bit soft-hearted in the best way. i care deeply, i feel intensely, and i’m definitely not afraid of emotional honesty—i actually appreciate it. i’m curious by nature, reflective, and always trying to grow. i love good music, singing, and the kind of conversations where both people drop their guard just a little.

i’m looking for a genuine connection that can naturally grow into something stable. i don’t rush things, but i’m intentional. i value emotional intelligence, kindness, and someone who knows what they want without playing games. chemistry matters, but so does the ability to communicate and show up for each other.

if you’re open-hearted, grounded, and looking for something real, we might click.

Hi everyone, I moved recently in Japan and I brought some of my electrical appliance from Europe. I have a coffee machine running on 230v/50 hz and 1250 W. I was originally planning to get a step up 2000W transformer but I found a 200v plug socket used for the washing machine. Will the machine work and provoke no damages if connected to that plug or is better to with wither transformer?",0,1765088600.0,espresso,2,0.5,False
1pgbbwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1pgbbwr/why_i_started_coffee_in_the_first_place/,Why I started coffee in the first place,"The first time I started drinking coffee was when I had to pull all nighters for big assignments due the next day. I was young and in college at the time, and was half assing my schoolwork, so I ended up having to pull all nighters to make sure assignments were finished last minute. 

I realized that it was important for me to remember why I began drinking coffee, because I notice what coffee does to me. Every time I drink coffee, it's like I'm bringing myself into that all nighter state. The stressed, hyperfocused and worried state of having an assignment due in 12 hours that I haven't started yet. I felt like this was great for me because it lets me focus on any work I have. 

But the thing is I'm no longer in school. I don't need to pull all nighters. I do things right away now, rather than leave it till last minute. But I constantly put myself into that stressed state by drinking coffee every time I have something to do. It feels productive, but it really isn't. I can do work without coffee, but it has conditioned me to think I need to be in an all nighter state to get work done. 

Then once the all nighter state runs out, I revert back to that half ass college kid, not doing anything. Incapable of doing anything, until I put myself back in an all nighter state again.

This was a great opportunity to hear his story, where he is from, the obstacles he has had to overcome, and to just tap into a passionate and creative mind for a few moments. 

Sometimes, the best things in life are so simple, just a few minutes of communicating with another person, drinking some coffee, and not being concerned about any agenda - just a few moments of peace.

Hope you guys get a chance to go check out some of Ryan's work sometime and also hope to meet ya'll at a cafe as well in the future. Be on the lookout for upcoming events to come join us at!",2,1765088319.0,MakanSociety,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone! I'm a software engineer in the US with 6 yrs of experience but with everything going on in the tech market (layoffs, AI and extremely saturated market) I feel like I'm stuck in my company and position that I don't like. I've been applying for jobs for about two yrs now and nothing. I absolutely despise this situation and I want out. I was thinking I need a career shift to truly get out of this trap or ""golden cage"" for good.
What careers do u suggest that don't need going back to the university? I have a MS in CS but it's worthless these days. I feel extremely depressed these days about my career outlook and truly need a change that's realistically possible. I'm not scared of dramatic changes and I'm even open to live on half of my current tech salary if I can start a career that has a future actually and I can grow in it. I like art, story telling, photography, coffee, cats,movies. I don't like financial careers. I'd read like to live in LA area preferably. I'm looking for a salary job/career at the moment not a commission based one.
Thanks!

1pgb9mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeckPrints/comments/1pgb9mj/whats_goal_of_life/,what's goal of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
