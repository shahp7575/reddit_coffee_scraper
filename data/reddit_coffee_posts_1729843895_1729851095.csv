I purchased the sage barista express last week and currently trying to explore different coffees that suit my preferences.

I wondered if there‚Äôs anyone with this machine using the GRIND coffee (house blend specifically)? I‚Äôve been having difficulties trying to dial it in. The coffee tastes good in a latte but the espresso shot itself is what to me tastes like bitter. I used 4 and 5 on the external grinder and set the inner burr to 3. My shots pour for about 20-21s.

I would be interested to hear people‚Äôs thoughts. Also let me know what coffee you use and what settings go along with it! I‚Äôm starting to feel fed up with constantly trying to figure out the perfect settings, though I know it‚Äôs part of the process.",1,1729850669.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

How should we tackle meals and groceries? ,"I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for over two years. We moved in together 6 months ago, which is when I started to realize just how different our eating habits are. I eat 3 square meals a day and have a few small dietary restrictions. I eat pretty healthy and lightly monitor my macros.  He forgets to eat often and when he does eat, it‚Äôs usually cereal, coffee, beer, pasta or steak. Neither of us enjoys cooking that much. I tend to cook more, but I am at a loss for what to do because he doesn‚Äôt really eat what I eat (unless I make a PB&J) and vice versa. Curious what other similar couples do! 
Grocery shopping is also a challenge because we have completely separate needs/wants and my stuff is usually more expensive. Also, he eats dinner between 830-930 pm and I like to eat dinner before 730 pm.  Feeling hopeless. Any advice? ",1,1729850663.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1gbqnek,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1gbqnek/men_love_bitches/,Men love bitches,"There is this book called ‚ÄúWhy men love bitches‚Äù 
And I‚Äôve never read it. But I‚Äôve seen a few videos discussing it. Just today I saw a video of a girl saying that while som advice given by the book can be useful, this attitude that women are taking is toxic and will lead you to be unhappy. You should not play difficult to get, you should be your authentic self, etc.

I‚Äôll give my opinion based on my experience: I used to be the ‚Äúcool girl‚Äù as they call it. I was not a girl, I was a 22 year old woman. Went to coffee dates, was understanding, never expected material things from any men, was authentic, answered with honesty to their questions, tried to have honest conversations on what I expected, made communication my priority, I would go on walking dates, etc. 

This lead me nowhere. For example, I was meeting this guy, straight out of university at the age of 27. He studied late. Was there for him when he was a broke student. As soon as he got a job offer to an important company he broke up with me. Six months after he was engaged to another woman. He took her to expensive trips, paid for all the wedding, etc.

This is just one example. But pretty much all the men I‚Äôve met have always taken me for granted.

This year I started changing my approach. I‚Äôm secretive about my private life, I don‚Äôt accept low effort dates, I don‚Äôt offer to pay, I make sure to take long to answer, etc. 
I do have to say that I also look better than before, I started working out, styling my hair in a more suitable way, dressing with high quality clothes, etc. 

And now I‚Äôm getting invited to places I‚Äôve never been before, getting gifts, having men answering me immediately and apologising when they are busy for work. 

It‚Äôs a whole new experience for me. 

Not going to lie, I miss being able to express myself freely around a man. Not having to dress a certain way for a date. Being more casual and simply being myself. 

But this got me nowhere. 

Right now I‚Äôm taking a step back from dating and trying to meet men. I have something big going on and im focusing on getting my dream job. But still, just the attention I get is impressive.

Impressive to how I was being treated before.

Context:

Im quite confused.

Lil background, we were college batchmates. Not that close. Normal classmates.

Tapos I was hired as HR associate. Siya HR Manager. Given na he is my boss i address him naman as Sir sa company premises.

So we're doing good naman as team. He would say na he wants me to step up as HR Associate and generalist sa agency na handle namin..which is i think im doing okay rin. Sayon ra daw ko nag catch-up from payroll, timekeeping, comp ben..and many more. (I was employed in the academe before this job sa corpo.)

Under sa amoa ang caf. So earlier i was making chika na the finance dept wants cafeteria which is under our management to budget2x ra and itemise jud and weekly meals and procurement of fresh produce and food kay murag dako ang gastos.

So he said while driving..nasa passenger seat ako. ""Inform me ng mga ganyan na concern ng finance kasi minsan im blinded na ng mga communication about sa caf. Di ako informed kay ikaw lang ang ga communicate nila..para alam ko if ano ang isasagot sa General Manager if magtatanong.""

Like okay parang lowkey saying im overstepping on him? Bypassing him? Diba he told me to step-up? So I did sakong part man. That's why I'm mentioning it to him na mao na sentiments ni finance.

Another scenario:

I was asked by the GM about listing kung kinsa ang makig overnight sa company since delicado if mag commute pa padung work cause of bagyo. Mag provide man daw sila mga staff house and rooms for those nga willing mag stay. Nya the past days on leave man si Boss maong ako ang gi ingnan ni GM na mag inform niya sa head count. Technically the general manager directly asked me to do this task.

See attached photo of my boss' reaction kay karon lang siya nakahibaw.

Just this afternoon rapud ning convo...he went out of the office and nag coffee kunuhay then sigeg chat nako. Wala nalang pud ko niya gi confront detso.


Tell me am I wrong? Do I have lapses? If yes? Asa dapita ug big deal ba jud kaayo ni? In my defense I think I am doing it with my own discretion and I am being held accountable man. 

Should I stay in my lane or mu step up kunuhay? Confused ko. Idk if he was threatened by me cause I have title and license attached in my name. While him he has a lot of work experiences naman cause he was working almost a decade na.

Send help? Mao diay ning corpo world sa? Maypa ga pursue nalang kog Clinical side of Psychology...patiente ra akong atubangon everyday. 

Pero as of now before I went home civil rapud kos iyaha. I just feel off.

1gbqmzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1gbqmzw/petty_revenge_which_ended_with_beautiful/,"Petty revenge, which ended with beautiful friendship","Hello there, 
I have a story to share. It happened ten years ago. 

For context:

Me (20F at that time) and my boyfriend (24M) moved to a village near town where I was attending college. It was old village and there were lots of old people. Some of them were really bitter so everytime I was walking my dog, I had my headphones on, so it would send a message that I'm not interested to start a conversation. 

To the story:

One day I finished my classes at college so I walked to supermarket to get some groceries. Again my headphones were on. But when I'm in public I have them at low volume so I'm aware of my surroudings. When I got to an aisle of milk I stand there for about 20 seconds. And BOOM! Somebody smashed my head with walking cane and actually breaks my headphones into half. I turned around and there she was. Old lady from our village. And she starts yelling: ""I was talking to you for 5 minutes! These young idiots! Move your ass! "" Like lady, what the fuck! She grabbed one milk and goes on like nothing happened. Me, being cool,  brushed it off. I finished my groceries and rushed to a bus to get home. And there she was again. Piercing me with deadly stare. But I did not care, which made her angry more. And it warmed my black petty soul..... So we got on the bus. She was still spitting some harmful words but again. I did not care.. When our stop came, she had that audicity to try hand me her groceries that I should carry them home for her. Hell nah! Respect me and I will respect you my lady! Soo I grabbed my bags and run home. I was feeling kinda guilty, cause my parents raised me better, but in back off my mind she deserved it. 

Month passed and one day I was walking my dog and we were passing her house. And I hear yelling. She was angry at her neighbour. You Know that neighbour had beautiful garden, everything blossoming. But for her taste, lots of insects. So she was demanding him to reduce some of it. Again in my mind. Hell nah! Soo my black mind came up with a plan. Next day I was in town and what did I found. Bag of seeds.. Seeds of dandelions. Yeah kinda cruel but.. Don't judge me I was only in my 20's.

Next week we had blackout in our village. So everything was in my favor. That night I dressed all black, went there, climbed her fence and throw that seeds at her garden. Her neighbour saw me, but he actually showed me thumbs up and did not say anything. 

Four weeks and her garden was blooming yellow. Every day I walked my dog around her house. I was again feeling guilty. First days you could hear her swearing but something good started happening. Every day she was out, trying to get rid of that dandelions. Every day she was out , moving. You could tell she was getting better, healthier. Every day she would start greeting everybody. And one day she started smiling instead of throwing insults at her neighbours. 

One day she actually invited me and my doggy when we were passing by. Every cell in my body was screaming go home but I went there anyway. And I'm glad I did. She seated me outside in a garden and went home to get a coffee. My doggy was playing there and when she came back she brought him a snack as well. Then she sit right next to me, grabbed my hand and said: ""Thank you, I know it was you. First I was pissed, but I forgot how is it to feel alive. "" I sat there in silence and actually apologized. ""No honey, I'm sorry for your headphones. I had really bad day"". And we talked. She told me how she is lonely. Her Husband was not there anymore and her children were not coming back to her. Only when they need something. 

Every week later on I was visiting her. I told her about my classes, about my boyfriend. She would play with my dog, telling me things about her past, showing me her family pictures. She started to invite her neighbours as well. You could tell, she was happy. We would talk about gardening and me and neighbours would by new seeds of flowers and vegetables for her garden. We became family of our own. 

When she had 80 birthday she invited me. So of course I accepted. I bought an outfit for her. Similiar as outfit I saw in her photo with her husband when they were young. I was so thrilled and rushed there. And there they were. Her family. You could tell from single look, they did not care about her. So I sat next to her, gave her the gift and tell her to open it. She cried, I cried and her children were pissed off. Fuck them. They left and I stayed and helped her with cleaning. I actually asked what happened between them. She told me that when her husband was alive, he told them that they need to show that they deserve their heritage. But when they were older they distanced themself and she was okay with it. They grew up so they need life of their own. But when her husband was dying they could not come. And for that, she can't forgive them. My heart broke into pieces. 

In the end of that year I went there on visit to bring her Christmas gift. A scarf that she was talking about. And I got a antique  pen from her grandfather. I did not wanted to take it but she insisted. 


In February next year she passed away in her sleep. I was heartbroken but at least she just fell asleep not feeling anything. Next day I got a call. Her children came and they were looking for that antique pen. Not sad that their mother is not there anymore. So I helped them look. But yeah it was not there anymore. Next week her daughter moved there and told me I could take everything I want from that house. So I took one photo. Photo of that old lady and her husband when they were young and left. 

Every year I visit her grave and guess what. I bring dandelions! Me and her children sometimes accidentally meet and they are still looking for that pen. And I still play dumb. I will keep it and then I will pass it down with her story to my children. Let it be a lesson. Sometimes when old people are bitter, try to look through it. Maybe they just need a friend.

It went well over a few month. I got admitted and after taking tranquilizers for 5 weeks the psychosis was seemingly gone.

Visual snow
Paranoid thoughts 
Feeling of being high on drugs
Being very sensitive to any kind of substance like coffee or weed
Shattered thoughts

Nightmares

These homes are not only built to impress but also to cater to the growing desire for sustainable, efficient, and stylish living.

Whether you are considering relocating or simply investing, new construction homes in Los Angeles present an ideal opportunity to settle down in one of the most dynamic cities in the world. From hillside retreats with stunning views to urban properties that connect you with the energy of the city's core, the options are endless. A home is not just about shelter; it is about providing a space that connects you with the essence of the environment around you. In Los Angeles, that environment is nothing short of magical, making the idea of a new construction home all the more appealing.

New homes are designed to fulfill modern expectations, and this is especially true in LA, where new construction projects consider both style and functionality. With cutting-edge architecture, innovative technologies, and state-of-the-art amenities, new construction homes allow homeowners to embrace the best of what 21st-century living has to offer. Built with high-quality materials, a focus on sustainability, and designed to minimize maintenance hassles, these homes are tailored to meet the needs of families, professionals, and retirees alike.

New construction homes in Los Angeles offer a lifestyle that is not just luxurious but also adaptable. LA is known for its diversity, and new homes cater to this diverse population by offering something for everyone. These homes incorporate features such as open floor plans, large windows, smart appliances, and efficient layouts. As technology becomes an increasingly essential part of our lives, these homes effortlessly integrate smart home systems that give residents control over lighting, security, climate, and entertainment‚Äîall from the palm of their hands.

**Modern Design and Architectural Brilliance**

One of the many highlights of new construction homes in Los Angeles is the stunning architecture. The city is known for its eclectic mix of styles‚Äîfrom mid-century modern marvels to contemporary masterpieces‚Äîand new homes are no exception. Many of the new properties blend seamlessly with the iconic look and feel of the city's neighborhoods, while also standing out with innovative and modern twists.

Architects in LA have been crafting homes that take full advantage of the region's unique geography and climate. Whether it‚Äôs by maximizing natural light, adding stunning outdoor spaces, or creating unique multi-functional living areas, the designs prioritize what makes California living so special. Expansive decks, large glass walls, and patios with panoramic views make homes in LA a true indoor-outdoor paradise, blurring the lines between the comfort of your home and the grandeur of nature.

A notable trend in Los Angeles is the increasing demand for eco-friendly homes. In response, new construction projects feature energy-efficient appliances, solar panels, low-emission building materials, and water-saving landscaping. Green living is not only about reducing your carbon footprint but also about enjoying lower energy bills and a more sustainable future. Homebuyers are increasingly attracted to properties that reflect their values, and many developers in LA are focused on incorporating green technologies without compromising on aesthetics or luxury.

**The Benefits of Buying New Construction Homes**

Purchasing a newly constructed home in Los Angeles comes with a long list of benefits. One of the most attractive aspects is the opportunity to personalize many aspects of the property. Buyers often get a say in the choice of finishes, from flooring and countertops to fixtures and cabinetry. This means you can create a home that truly feels like it‚Äôs yours from day one. With pre-owned homes, renovations can be time-consuming and costly, but a new build allows for that personalized touch with none of the extra effort.

New construction homes also come with fewer surprises compared to older homes, which may require expensive repairs due to wear and tear. Imagine moving in without the fear of having to replace a roof or overhaul the plumbing soon after settling in. The convenience of brand-new materials, appliances, and systems ensures a worry-free transition and years of comfort. For many buyers, this peace of mind is worth every penny.

Another major perk of new construction homes is the availability of modern floor plans and features. Older homes may have layouts that no longer suit contemporary lifestyles, such as small, enclosed kitchens or awkwardly spaced living areas. By contrast, newer homes offer open layouts that prioritize space, movement, and the seamless flow of natural light. High ceilings, expansive living areas, and large windows make for a bright and airy space that feels inviting and comfortable.

**Location, Convenience, and Community**

New construction homes in Los Angeles are often built in thoughtfully planned communities designed to foster a sense of belonging. These neighborhoods are tailored to provide convenience, including proximity to schools, shopping centers, parks, and entertainment hubs. They often come with shared amenities such as swimming pools, fitness centers, and community gardens, making it easy for residents to socialize and enjoy a balanced lifestyle.

The allure of new construction homes in Los Angeles also lies in the city's vast array of location choices. Whether you crave the vibrant energy of downtown living, the relaxed luxury of the beachside, or the quiet charm of a suburban enclave, there are options that cater to every taste. Many new communities are designed to be pedestrian-friendly, encouraging a healthier and more active lifestyle. The proximity to parks, nature trails, and recreation areas offers a respite from the hustle and bustle of city life, giving residents a perfect balance between work and relaxation.

**Customization and Modern Amenities**

Today's homebuyers have diverse needs, and new construction homes are designed to offer customization that meets these varying preferences. Imagine walking into your dream kitchen‚Äîcomplete with the latest appliances, stunning cabinetry, and countertops that reflect your unique taste. With a new construction home, you have the opportunity to make these dreams a reality from the very beginning. From choosing wall colors and flooring to designing your perfect backyard oasis, these homes let you put your mark on your space.

Modern amenities in new homes are another major draw. The desire for efficiency, comfort, and technological integration has never been higher, and new construction homes are stepping up to the challenge. Smart home technology has become a standard feature, allowing homeowners to control climate, lighting, security, and entertainment systems with ease. Imagine a home that not only welcomes you with the perfect temperature as you walk in the door but also allows you to monitor your energy usage from your smartphone. These kinds of features are making life easier, more comfortable, and even more affordable over the long term.

**Investing in Los Angeles Real Estate**

Real estate in Los Angeles is as much about lifestyle as it is about investment. The city's diverse neighborhoods, strong job market, and iconic cultural scene make it one of the most desirable places to call home. Investing in a new construction home in Los Angeles offers the potential for significant financial returns. Historically, property values in LA have shown resilience and growth, even during challenging economic times. Buyers are not only purchasing a home; they are investing in a city that continues to thrive.

The new construction market in LA also provides more straightforward investment options. Unlike older properties that may have hidden maintenance costs, newer homes come with warranties that protect the buyer from unexpected expenses. This aspect, combined with the rising demand for housing in Southern California, makes investing in new homes a smart financial move.

**Comfort, Convenience, and Safety**

One of the main advantages of new construction homes is the attention given to comfort and safety. These homes are constructed to meet modern building codes, which means that safety features‚Äîsuch as advanced wiring, fire safety systems, and energy-efficient insulation‚Äîare up to the latest standards. You can rest easy knowing that your home has been built to the highest quality and safety specifications.

Comfort in a new home is also assured through advanced building materials and techniques. The insulation keeps homes cool in the summer and warm in the winter while reducing energy costs. Double-glazed windows block out external noise, making your home a peaceful retreat even if you are in the heart of a bustling city. Modern HVAC systems, high-efficiency appliances, and carefully planned layouts all add to the level of comfort provided in these homes.

**A Lifestyle Upgrade**

Buying a new construction home in Los Angeles is more than just acquiring property‚Äîit's an upgrade in lifestyle. These homes are built to meet the diverse needs of people looking to lead a modern, well-balanced life. Whether it‚Äôs having space for a home office, a backyard designed for weekend gatherings, or a kitchen that allows you to unleash your inner chef, these homes cater to the lifestyle aspirations of today's homeowners.

Living in LA offers more than the typical suburban experience. With endless entertainment options, renowned dining destinations, and cultural attractions, every neighborhood provides a unique living experience. Imagine living within walking distance of a weekend farmer's market or having a short drive to some of the most beautiful beaches on the West Coast. These are the perks that new construction homes in Los Angeles provide.

**Connectivity and Convenience**

With the advent of remote working, many people are rethinking their living arrangements and looking for homes that offer both comfort and connectivity. Los Angeles provides the perfect blend of city living and suburban tranquility. New construction homes are designed to accommodate home office needs, with many offering additional rooms that can be used as dedicated workspaces.

In addition to connectivity within the home, location is another significant factor. New homes are being built in some of the most connected parts of Los Angeles, with easy access to public transport, major highways, and urban centers. Whether you're commuting to work or simply going out to explore what LA has to offer, convenience is a given.

**Smart Living and Energy Efficiency**

A focus on energy efficiency and smart living features has become a key selling point for new construction homes. With increasing awareness about the impact of climate change, more homebuyers are seeking residences that contribute to sustainability efforts. These homes are constructed with energy-saving features that reduce consumption and help homeowners save money in the long run.

Solar panels, high-efficiency HVAC systems, and advanced insulation techniques are just some of the features that contribute to energy efficiency. Smart home systems take things a step further, allowing you to automate and optimize energy usage. Imagine waking up to sunlight streaming in as your automated blinds rise and your smart thermostat adjusts the temperature to a comfortable level. These small conveniences contribute to an overall lifestyle that is more relaxed, efficient, and connected.

**Finding the Perfect New Construction Home in LA**

With so many options on the market, finding the perfect new construction home in Los Angeles may seem like a challenge‚Äîbut it‚Äôs an exciting one. Start by identifying what‚Äôs important to you. Do you want to be close to the beach? Or perhaps you prefer the cultural buzz of downtown Los Angeles? Are you looking for a suburban neighborhood where you can raise a family, or do you want to be in the heart of the action?

Once you have a clear vision of what you want, explore the different communities that Los Angeles has to offer. From the serene hillsides of the Valley to the bustling streets of West Hollywood, there‚Äôs a neighborhood that will perfectly match your lifestyle. Take the time to visit these areas and imagine yourself living there‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs enjoying an afternoon hike in the nearby mountains, attending a community event, or sipping your morning coffee with ocean views.

**Embrace the California Lifestyle**

Los Angeles is a city that has something for everyone‚Äîart, culture, stunning scenery, and a vibrant community. By investing in a new construction home, you are not just buying a house; you are choosing to be a part of this dynamic environment. New homes reflect the best aspects of modern living, combining comfort, sustainability, luxury, and convenience in a way that older properties simply cannot.

The process of finding a new construction home may take time, but the end result is a beautiful, customized residence that meets your every need. With so many benefits on offer, it's easy to see why new construction homes in Los Angeles are capturing the attention of homebuyers. They provide the perfect canvas for your California dream.

1gbqcj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1gbqcj7/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1gbq9yl,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gbq9yl/im_a_fking_mess/,I'm a F*king Mess,"(THIS IS LONG)

I was an alternative kid in my teens and 20s, I had dyed hair, wore makeup and had and was a bit of a misfit. But I was me, unapologetically, I had an identity, a sense of self and an exciting and unknown future in front of me. I was going to change the world.

Fast forward to my early 30s and I just feel deflated. Over time, all my friends branched off and disappeared into their own lives. The few who I still do speak to are what I would call the losers, they have gone corporate and lead dull lives, all they ever talk about is money, position, and plans for the future. I still haven‚Äôt really progressed anywhere in my life, I haven‚Äôt achieved anything of note, I don‚Äôt have any dreams any more. I am numb, lost and without any sense of purpose or meaning. All the optimism that I once had for the future has completely disappeared and it feels like the world has defeated me and I am just floating.

I have a pattern of getting these sudden bursts of energy and motivation and i feel like my old self in my 20s where i can take on the world and i have all these goals i want to accomplish. But then something in me just snaps, and i go back to being severely lazy and depressed and not wanting to do anything. Just sitting and eating and smoking and daydreaming. Those are the only things that bring me joy.

I have never understood how people can work full time or at all and just function and push through day by day. I understand that they do it because they have responsibilities. But i have responsibilities too. I know what it‚Äôs like to have nothing, and that still isn‚Äôt enough. How do people do that?? like are you all fucking robots?? Did i miss some type of programming or battery pack that was supposed to be installed in me when i turned 18?? it‚Äôs just so miserable for me.

I don‚Äôt want to do anything. i don‚Äôt want to get better. I don‚Äôt want a job. I don‚Äôt want to be successful. I don‚Äôt want to exist on this earth. I want to just be in bed. But I know I should be doing these things, but I just don‚Äôt see the point. I think subconsciously I know I am wasting my life away because every night before bed I have trouble sleeping and severe anxiety attacks and fear of death and not being able to do anything again. It's such an oxymoron.

I wake up and I am exhausted, tired of the world before even beginning. I daydream so much. like an unhealthy amount. I've realised that i've been doing it all my life, and it‚Äôs to escape the loneliness that i‚Äôve always felt and the misery and disappointment I feel towards the world. It is such a grey, cruel place that does not care and the majority of people are like drones with no distinguishing characteristics - selfish self centered creatures who are all on a mission to lie, cheat and fuck each other over in order to get slightly ahead.

It‚Äôs so pathetic because some of these people that i daydream about are people I barely know, or haven't spoken to in years, or relationships from years ago, or decades where I wasn't even alive. I‚Äôve created this safe space in my head, envisioning different scenarios where they‚Äôre my friends or my partner and everything is adventurous and exciting and loving and they like me and life is perfect. In reality however, most every one of these friendships or relationships that i daydream about, i‚Äôve burned to the ground and of course, in the real world, these people are enjoying their lives and are not thinking about me at all. They probably wouldn‚Äôt even remember who i was if they saw me today. Yet here i am, thousands of miles away in my little apartment, blasting music and pacing back and forth, talking to them as if they were actually here with me.

It is so embarrassing, and I‚Äôm cringing writing this. I‚Äôm not doing anything in my life. I‚Äôm just in my head all the time. I‚Äôve been living in these fantasies. All these fake story lines that I have created with these people. But i can‚Äôt help it, it makes me feel good. It helps me escape into this world where I'm not such a misfit with a miserable existence and resentment towards a life that held the promise of so much yet delivered nothing.

My alarm goes off at 7:30 every morning, but I always turn it off and end up getting out of bed much later. Whenever I do get out of bed, I just feel exhausted and poorly rested. I drag myself downstairs where I will drink a coffee and smoke and either daydream or watch some mindless crap on youtube (my laptop virtually never leaves my side). I will then scroll political sites and forums to get updates on all of the doom and gloom of the political world, I know it is bad for my mental health but I am addicted to it. I guess I‚Äôm just hoping to read about a miracle that has happened that will make things better. I will then call up any member of the family who will answer because it is an excuse to talk, pass time, drink coffee and smoke more. Then it will be more couch sitting, doom scrolling, looking at old photos of happier times (which just makes me more miserable because those days aren‚Äôt coming back), watching youtube. I‚Äôve also noticed that I endlessly browse eBay and other buying sites for things that I can‚Äôt afford because the idea of having these things feeds into my daydreaming. Like I know I don‚Äôt have it, won‚Äôt have it, and can‚Äôt afford it, but imagine if I did, the adventures I would have, or what I would do.

I‚Äôve realised that i have no identity. no sense of self. i don‚Äôt think i know who i am. when I‚Äôm around different people, it‚Äôs like I shape into who I think i‚Äôm supposed to be at that moment. I don‚Äôt know what I like, or what I really want. I just put on different masks in front of different faces. I feel like an actor all the time, putting on a performance all the time. I have spent so much time fantasizing in my head *(which is so much better than the real world)* that I have lost who i am. Ok, there are times when i feel like i am being myself with certain people, so I can‚Äôt say it's all the time, but before long, I'm back to pretending. back to feeling like I'm just here, existing, and no one understands me. it‚Äôs all really confusing and I am massively disassociated.

The only things i can say I‚Äôve found genuine interest in and have enjoyed in life are mechanics, designing and acting. As much as I hate it, I lost interest in mechanics years ago projects lie in the garage unfinished and i have no motivation to pick them up again. Designing became part of a self-employment attempt and when it didn't work out, it became a chore. - and with acting, I wouldn‚Äôt want to do it again, I already am in real life.

Another pathetic point. My partner pays my rent. All my life my family have swooped in and saved me and now my partner does it too, which has always further enabled my laziness because i know, no matter how many times i fall, one of them will pick me up again and again. So financially, everything is taken care of everything for me. my lazy ass just piggybacks off them because i don‚Äôt wanna do anything in life like the pathetic person i am.

One flicker of hope came recently when I found a classic beetle that was up for sale which sparked me up again. Sure, it would mean I'd need to get a loan, and sell my existing car. Sure it would be constant work to keep it running. Hell, I might need to get a part time job to fund it. But I thought, could it be the break out of this chain by kicking me up the ass and giving me a goal? a purpose? something to work and live for? - Or is it just more daydreaming and a desperate attempt at escapism through materialism?

I‚Äôm so fucked up and have been realizing my habits and how bad they are. it‚Äôs so overwhelming, and i don‚Äôt know what to do or where to begin, everything is inter-connected and related to something else. The only thing i know to do, the only thing that i want to do and that‚Äôs familiar to me and brings me comfort, is to keep doing what I‚Äôm doing. but it‚Äôs also harming me. it‚Äôs making me dig myself deeper into this hole. this miserable, soul-sucking, agonizing hole.

But then something in me just snaps, and i go back to being severely lazy and depressed and not wanting to do anything. Just sitting and eating and smoking and daydreaming. Those are the only things that bring me joy.

I have never understood how people can work full time or at all and just function and push through day by day. I understand that they do it because they have responsibilities. But i have responsibilities too. I know what it‚Äôs like to have nothing, and that still isn‚Äôt enough. How do people do that?? like are you all fucking robots?? Did i miss some type of programming or battery pack that was supposed to be installed in me when i turned 18?? it‚Äôs just so miserable for me.

I don‚Äôt want to do anything. i don‚Äôt want to get better. I don‚Äôt want a job. I don‚Äôt want to be successful. I don‚Äôt want to exist on this earth. I want to just be in bed. But I know I should be doing these things, but I just don‚Äôt see the point. I think subconsciously I know I am wasting my life away because every night before bed I have trouble sleeping and severe anxiety attacks and fear of death and not being able to do anything again. It's such an oxymoron.

I wake up and I am exhausted, tired of the world before even beginning. I daydream so much. like an unhealthy amount. I've realised that i've been doing it all my life, and it‚Äôs to escape the loneliness that i‚Äôve always felt and the misery and disappointment I feel towards the world. It is such a grey, cruel place that does not care and the majority of people are like drones with no distinguishing characteristics - selfish self centered creatures who are all on a mission to lie, cheat and fuck each other over in order to get slightly ahead.

It‚Äôs so pathetic because some of these people that i daydream about are people I barely know, or haven't spoken to in years, or relationships from years ago, or decades where I wasn't even alive. I‚Äôve created this safe space in my head, envisioning different scenarios where they‚Äôre my friends or my partner and everything is adventurous and exciting and loving and they like me and life is perfect. In reality however, most every one of these friendships or relationships that i daydream about, i‚Äôve burned to the ground and of course, in the real world, these people are enjoying their lives and are not thinking about me at all. They probably wouldn‚Äôt even remember who i was if they saw me today. Yet here i am, thousands of miles away in my little apartment, blasting music and pacing back and forth, talking to them as if they were actually here with me.

It is so embarrassing, and I‚Äôm cringing writing this. I‚Äôm not doing anything in my life. I‚Äôm just in my head all the time. I‚Äôve been living in these fantasies. All these fake story lines that I have created with these people. But i can‚Äôt help it, it makes me feel good. It helps me escape into this world where I'm not such a misfit with a miserable existence and resentment towards a life that held the promise of so much yet delivered nothing.

My alarm goes off at 7:30 every morning, but I always turn it off and end up getting out of bed much later. Whenever I do get out of bed, I just feel exhausted and poorly rested. I drag myself downstairs where I will drink a coffee and smoke and either daydream or watch some mindless crap on youtube (my laptop virtually never leaves my side). I will then scroll political sites and forums to get updates on all of the doom and gloom of the political world, I know it is bad for my mental health but I am addicted to it. I guess I‚Äôm just hoping to read about a miracle that has happened that will make things better. I will then call up any member of the family who will answer because it is an excuse to talk, pass time, drink coffee and smoke more. Then it will be more couch sitting, doom scrolling, looking at old photos of happier times (which just makes me more miserable because those days aren‚Äôt coming back), watching youtube. I‚Äôve also noticed that I endlessly browse eBay and other buying sites for things that I can‚Äôt afford because the idea of having these things feeds into my daydreaming. Like I know I don‚Äôt have it, won‚Äôt have it, and can‚Äôt afford it, but imagine if I did, the adventures I would have, or what I would do.

I‚Äôve realised that i have no identity. no sense of self. i don‚Äôt think i know who i am. when I‚Äôm around different people, it‚Äôs like I shape into who I think i‚Äôm supposed to be at that moment. I don‚Äôt know what I like, or what I really want. I just put on different masks in front of different faces. I feel like an actor all the time, putting on a performance all the time. I have spent so much time fantasizing in my head *(which is so much better than the real world)* that I have lost who i am. Ok, there are times when i feel like i am being myself with certain people, so I can‚Äôt say it's all the time, but before long, I'm back to pretending. back to feeling like I'm just here, existing, and no one understands me. it‚Äôs all really confusing and I am massively disassociated.

The only things i can say I‚Äôve found genuine interest in and have enjoyed in life are mechanics, designing and acting. As much as I hate it, I lost interest in mechanics years ago projects lie in the garage unfinished and i have no motivation to pick them up again. Designing became part of a self-employment attempt and when it didn't work out, it became a chore. - and with acting, I wouldn‚Äôt want to do it again, I already am in real life.

Another pathetic point. My partner pays my rent. All my life my family have swooped in and saved me and now my partner does it too, which has always further enabled my laziness because i know, no matter how many times i fall, one of them will pick me up again and again. So financially, everything is taken care of everything for me. my lazy ass just piggybacks off them because i don‚Äôt wanna do anything in life like the pathetic person i am.

One flicker of hope came recently when I found a classic beetle that was up for sale which sparked me up again. Sure, it would mean I'd need to get a loan, and sell my existing car. Sure it would be constant work to keep it running. Hell, I might need to get a part time job to fund it. But I thought, could it be the break out of this chain by kicking me up the ass and giving me a goal? a purpose? something to work and live for? - Or is it just more daydreaming and a desperate attempt at escapism through materialism?

I‚Äôm so fucked up and have been realizing my habits and how bad they are. it‚Äôs so overwhelming, and i don‚Äôt know what to do or where to begin, everything is inter-connected and related to something else. The only thing i know to do, the only thing that i want to do and that‚Äôs familiar to me and brings me comfort, is to keep doing what I‚Äôm doing. but it‚Äôs also harming me. it‚Äôs making me dig myself deeper into this hole. this miserable, soul-sucking, agonizing hole.

I will then call up any member of the family who will answer because it is an excuse to talk, pass time, drink coffee and smoke more. Then it will be more couch sitting, doom scrolling, looking at old photos of happier times (which just makes me more miserable because those days aren‚Äôt coming back), watching youtube. I‚Äôve also noticed that I endlessly browse eBay and other buying sites for things that I can‚Äôt afford because the idea of having these things feeds into my daydreaming. Like I know I don‚Äôt have it, won‚Äôt have it, and can‚Äôt afford it, but imagine if I did, the adventures I would have, or what I would do. 

I‚Äôve realised that i have no identity. no sense of self. i don‚Äôt think i know who i am. when I‚Äôm around different people, it‚Äôs like I shape into who I think i‚Äôm supposed to be at that moment. I don‚Äôt know what I like, or what I really want. I just put on different masks in front of different faces. I feel like an actor all the time, putting on a performance all the time. I have spent so much time fantasizing in my head *(which is so much better than the real world)* that I have lost who i am. Ok, there are times when i feel like i am being myself with certain people, so I can‚Äôt say it's all the time, but before long, I'm back to pretending. back to feeling like I'm just here, existing, and no one understands me. it‚Äôs all really confusing and I am massively disassociated. 

The only things i can say I‚Äôve found genuine interest in and have enjoyed in life are mechanics, designing and acting. As much as I hate it, I lost interest in mechanics years ago projects lie in the garage unfinished and i have no motivation to pick them up again. Designing became part of a self-employment attempt and when it didn't work out, it became a chore. - and with acting, I wouldn‚Äôt want to do it again, I already am in real life. 

Another pathetic point. My partner pays my rent. All my life my family have swooped in and saved me and now my partner does it too, which has always further enabled my laziness because i know, no matter how many times i fall, one of them will pick me up again and again. So financially, everything is taken  care of everything for me. my lazy ass just piggybacks off them because i don‚Äôt wanna do anything in life like the pathetic person i am. 

One flicker of hope came recently when I found a classic beetle that was up for sale which sparked me up again. Sure, it would mean I'd need to get a loan, and sell my existing car. Sure it would be constant work to keep it running. Hell, I might need to get a part time job to fund it. But I thought, could it be the break out of this chain by kicking me up the ass and giving me a goal? a purpose? something to work and live for? - Or is it just more daydreaming and a desperate attempt at escapism through materialism? 

I‚Äôm so fucked up and have been realizing my habits and how bad they are. it‚Äôs so overwhelming, and i don‚Äôt know what to do or where to begin, everything is inter-connected and related to something else. The only thing i know to do, the only thing that i want to do and that‚Äôs familiar to me and brings me comfort, is to keep doing what I‚Äôm doing. but it‚Äôs also harming me. it‚Äôs making me dig myself deeper into this hole. this miserable, soul-sucking, agonizing hole. 

Thank you for reading this if you did. I know it was a lot.

So, I (19M) went on a coffee date with this girl (19F) yesterday, and it felt painfully awkward toward the end. She‚Äôs absolutely stunning‚Äîlike, the kind of pretty that made it even harder for me to act natural. I wouldn‚Äôt say she‚Äôs out of my league (I‚Äôm fairly attractive), but her looks definitely added onto my nervousness.

On top of that, I had a ton of personal and work-related stuff on my mind, which kept me from focusing and probably added to the awkward vibe. We actually have a lot in common and seem to complement each other well, so I really want to give this another try.

Now I‚Äôm out of town for four days, so I haven‚Äôt had a chance to ask her out again in person or explain the awkwardness. She‚Äôs still snapping me back, so she‚Äôs not ghosting, but I‚Äôm nervous about bringing up a second date.

Should I casually mention that I was distracted, or just go for a straightforward ‚Äúlet‚Äôs hang out again‚Äù? Any advice would help a lot! Thanks!",1,1729847830.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I'm still on NTR, but not smoking has been the best thing I did for myself in a long time. My health is increasing and I feel much better in the morning not coughing my lungs out. 

I've replaced my smoking breaks by drinking tea instead and making that ""a moment"". I'm used to drinking coffee in the morning, but weirdly enough it doesn't tastes as good without my cig. Lowering my caffeine intake as well, as a bonus.

My ADHD is kind of worse without the soothing habit and lowering my nicotine and caffeine intake, but feeling in control makes up for that.

1gbpyup,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1gbpyup/as_a_vanilla_girlie_i_have_been_sleeping_on_black/,"As a vanilla girlie, I have been sleeping on Black Opium Le Parfum! What other similar perfumes would you recommend, or commiserate on some rambles about my failed blind buys? ","So, I am a self-professed vanilla lover but my journey only began when I tried Phlur's Vanilla Skin and realized.... ok wait I LOVE this. I always used to be a fruity girl (Marc Jacobs Blush Eau So Fresh was my blue whale!) and never really ventured into gourmands but **this was the year.**

Here is my collection below so far, with some of my vanilla favorites being Phlur Vanilla Skin, Lattafa Angham, Maison Mataha Escapade Gourmande, Bianco Latte and most recently Black Opium Le Parfum (I actually find that Angham and the YSL dry down smell quite similar).

https://preview.redd.it/s4zl42sicvwd1.png?width=2646&format=png&auto=webp&s=156891ced9c94e27eec6ef5e02dfc784a5e65d15

I did not like the OG Black Opium (pink center) but I read loads of reviews sharing how much deeper, cozier, more vanilla-forward and almost boozy the Le Parfum (black glittery center) was and decided to give it a try.

And here I'd like to segue into the failed blind buys segment:

I have been burnt by a couple of gourmand blind buys recently which sounded absolutely great but unfortunately I really disliked on my skin or in the air:

\- Kyse Delizia Di Marshmallow: all I really smell is kerosene and marshmallows which are 99% burnt, sadly! Plus the oil slick it leaves behind is a no-go for me.

\- Choco Musk el rehab: I feel like the alcohol is too intense in the opening and sticks around for a while? Leaving it to mature and currently using it as a house/bathroom scent.

\- Sweet Tooth: the notes on these looked hella complex but the only thing I can think of is ""SWEET"" when I smell this. I don‚Äôt hate it, but I normally use it to add a touch of vanilla/marshmallow to my other scents.

\- Hez Parfums Banana Bread Banshee and Hilde Soliani Donna Sentenza: Man I was super excited for these. The whole premise for my search for a banana bread/cake perfume was because I fell in love with the Main Street Bakery candle from B&BW (Fragrance notes: fresh banana, vanilla wafers and cinnamon sugar) but unfortunately, none of these panned out. Banana Bread Banshee was the first scent I ever threw away and didn't even repurpose as a toilet/house spray because it was... revolting.

Donna Sentenza was way too cloying for me. I spent a long time researching and debating between this and the Comptoir sud pacifique vanille banane. I don't dislike it but it is too much like Banana Milk or laffy taffy rather than a yummy, cozy, banana bread :(

Now back to the Le Parfum:  
Top notes are Cinnamon, Pear and Green Mandarin; middle notes are Solar Notes, Jasmine Sambac and Orange Blossom; base notes are Madagascar Vanilla, Bourbon Vanilla, Vanilla Absolute, Coffee, Vanilla Orchid and Patchouli.

The moment I smelt the Le Parfum sample I immediately ordered a full sized bottle. It is just the stuff of my dreams - longevity is great but sillage is moderate (I like to smell it on myself throughout the day and don't really like it to be too loud) and it's so deep, comforting and cozy. It is versatile enough to be worn in hotter seasons but I definitely agree it is absolutely fall/autumn comfort in a bottle.

I absolutely dislike jasmine when it's done with a heavy or even moderate hand (Valentina Donna Born In Roma was like diluted jasmine water to me it was so disappointing! I was excited about the pink pepper and blackcurrant top notes which reminded me of Kate Spade Sparkle, as well as the base of Bourbon Vanilla and Cashmeran. But alas the jasmine trio was just too overpowering for me!) but the jasmine in this is undetectable! If you like any of the vanillas in the collection I listed, definitely give this one a try!

Are there any other similar vanilla-forward scents (bonus if they have pink pepper) you would recommend or even to avoid?",2,1729847360.0,FemFragLab,4,0.75,False
1gbpypl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Slothana/comments/1gbpypl/the_sloths_climb_to_success_a_fairytale/,The Sloth's Climb to Success - a fairytale,"¬†In the heart of the bustling city, where the streets never slept, lived a sloth named Alan. Alan had a job that was as exhausting as it was monotonous ‚Äì a 9 to 5 desk job that left him feeling like he was moving through molasses.

¬†""I can't keep doing this,"" Alan sighed to himself, his eyes weary from staring at the computer screen. ""There has to be more to life than this.""

¬†Alans's coworkers, known as the ""paperhands,"" constantly doubted his abilities and mocked his slow pace. ""You'll never get ahead, Alan,"" they would sneer. ""You're just a lazy sloth.""

¬†But Alan had a secret weapon ‚Äì his friends, the ""diamond hands,"" who believed in him wholeheartedly. Lilly, a wise old owl, and Fritz, a determined squirrel, rallied around Alan, encouraging him to take a chance and pursue his dreams.

¬†""You have so much potential, Alan,"" Lilly said, her eyes twinkling. ""Don't let those paperhands hold you back.""

¬†Inspired by his friends' unwavering support, Alan decided to take the leap. He quit his desk job and started his own business, a cozy caf√© where he could work at his own pace. The paperhands scoffed, but Alan didn't let their doubts deter him.

¬†With the help of Lilly and Fritz, Alan's caf√© slowly but surely gained a loyal following. His unique blend of coffee und herbs and his genuine kindness won over the hearts of his customers, and soon, the once-struggling sloth was thriving.

¬†""I can't believe I almost gave up,"" Alan said, beaming with pride. ""Thanks to my diamond hands, I've found my true calling.""

¬†And so, the sloth who once felt trapped in a 9 to 5 job had climbed to the top, proving that with the right support and determination, even the slowest of creatures can achieve their dreams.

I'm 25m now for context to all of this, sorry for the long spiel but there's background I'd like to cover. After I had graduated high school, I basically became a recluse due to issues with my anxiety and self image. It was fine for a while and eventually I did have a very good breakthrough where I enrolled in an online university. While I was content with being an introvert all those years, recently I have been struggling more with mental health issues, mainly my aforementioned anxiety.

Now I understand that we have an inherent sense of needing interaction and I've been working towards that thankfully, but those years of anxiety have left me in a situation that I regret putting myself in to. It was only recently did I start reconnecting with old friends via social media, but having lost out on attending/even finding out that they were getting married. I wasn't bitter about it, but felt upset that I lost out on that experience. With that said I've been making strides to better my self and my communication skills to hopefully prevent missing out on important life stuff like that.

So here's where I get to the now: a few months ago I had remet a girl I was interested in years ago (I had gone to prom with her, too) who was working at a coffee shop at the time. While the interest I had in her wasn't present when I saw her again, it only recently began to affect me again. I hadn't bothered asking for a way to contact her as I was probably feeling anxious and wanted to get home. I wanted to get into contact with her if she'd like to go out to lunch or something like that (which would be monumental considering I've always had issues asking people such things). Issues arose when I found the social media accounts I knew she had were completely inactive and the app we used to contact each other had gone defunct. I'm not sure of where she lives as I'm certain she moved in the years where I shut myself in (and I'm not too interested in trying to search her address since that's weird; though I pretty sure she's in the same town as me still). She doesn't seem to work at the coffee shop anymore according to my dad who frequents the place.

With all that said; how do I proceed with this? The uncertainty all of this has been hard to manage mainly because of my anxiety issues. The only means that I think I have to even get ahold of her is via a mutual friend of ours who I do have contact with but she hasn't been online for nearly a month now. I have throw her a message in an attempt to reconnect, but I don't want to see prying when asking for information about her friend.

It's a simple thing but I've always been bad with initiating romantic relationships, apologies if this comes off as plain situation. I've been working to improve how I handle anxiety but stuff like this has always been a wall. Thanks.",1,1729847213.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Just got my hands on some scents from the viral instagram store - Muse Beauty, an Indian-based, women-led brand. Here‚Äôs my rundown on their dupes:

Coco Vanilla Bourbon - Dupe of Alien Mugler
I was drawn to the coconut notes, but it leans more musky than coconut. Vanilla is faint, but the dry-down brings a boozy coconut vibe. Not for me, so I‚Äôll pass on repurchasing.

Strawberry Shortcake - Dupe of Dior Miss Cherie
A clean, berry-rose beauty! Miss Cherie fans (RIP) will appreciate this one. Definitely repurchasing; it lasted all day.

Smoky Vanilla - Dupe of Kayali 28
Didn‚Äôt love this, but I wasn't a fan of the original either. Not for me but worth a try for Kayali fans.

Forbidden Cherry - Dupe of Tom Ford Lost Cherry
Deep, warm cherry with a hint of a fireplace note. Perfect for winter! Makes me feel like a femme fatale in a cozy bookstore.

Espresso Vanilla - Dupe of Black Opium
Obsessed! Rich coffee and vanilla, with a warm, sophisticated vibe. Absolute winner.

Cinnamon Apple Pie - Dupe of Lattafa Khamrah
Not a fan of Khamrah's oudiness, but this version is divine! Cinnamon-forward with a light apple and vanilla hint.

Strawberry Milkshake - Dupe of Burberry Her
Expected more, but it came off as a powdery strawberry. Wanted a vanilla strawberry gourmand so a bit disappointed but I will give it another chance.

Minis are from a 5ml discovery set (‚Çπ399), which is great value for trying multiple scents. Can't say much about sillage/projection yet, but overall, a solid experience so far!

I drink water before and after every meal. 

I keep a creative diary that tracks my weight and progress 
I also have the Renpho scale and measuring tape, I love it ! 

I'm 5'2 female and eat around 1300-1200 calories a day.

1gbpqi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1gbpqi8/am_i_being_unreasonable_as_the_sole_provider_for/,Am I Being Unreasonable as the Sole Provider for My Family? ,"Hey Reddit,

I'm reaching out because I‚Äôm honestly not sure if I'm being unreasonable or if my situation is a bit unfair. I‚Äôd love to hear your perspectives on this, because I‚Äôm really confused.

Here‚Äôs the situation: I‚Äôm the sole provider for my family, which includes my wife (a stay-at-home mom) and our child, who‚Äôs three years old. I make just enough to cover all our costs of living. I pay for rent, bills, food, coffee, childcare, and even a cleaner who comes once a week to help with tidying up our small, 35-40 square meter apartment.

I don‚Äôt resent the fact that my wife isn‚Äôt working; we move a lot for my job, and she doesn‚Äôt always have a work visa in each country, which is frustrating for her. We‚Äôre actively trying to solve this issue ‚Äì even going into debt sometimes to pay for lawyers to secure her visas. The tough part is, whenever she finally does get a visa, we often end up having to move again.

While I‚Äôm tidy, I absolutely hate cleaning and tidying up. It genuinely gives me anxiety, and I‚Äôm terrible at it, so I‚Äôve pretty much declared to my wife that I won‚Äôt do it. I try to make up for this by covering all expenses, including the cleaner‚Äôs cost, which was how I managed things even before we were together. My wife, on the other hand, prefers to let things accumulate and then do one ‚Äúbig clean,‚Äù but she resents it if I don‚Äôt pitch in when that happens.

I‚Äôve also noticed she‚Äôs resentful toward me for what she sees as a ‚Äúsacrifice of her career‚Äù for our family. But, truthfully, she was more than happy to stop working when we decided to have a child and live this way. Her previous job was organizing events once or twice a year, which covered her basic, single-living costs. So, while I understand her frustration, it feels like a mutual choice she now resents me for.

Most weekdays, I cook dinner using ingredients from a meal kit delivery service, and I often take us out on weekends to eat. Despite this, my wife complains about having to cook on her days or cleaning up afterward. She also feels pressured with our child outside of childcare hours, which are from 8:00 AM to 3:30 PM, though she usually starts the day late, so drop-off doesn‚Äôt happen until around 9 or 9:30.

The house tends to feel messy between cleaner visits, and I admit I get frustrated when things like wet towels are left lying around, forcing me to run around just to find a dry one after my shower.

I get that this is just my perspective, and I‚Äôm sure my wife would have her own side if she were here to explain. But I can't shake the feeling that I‚Äôm carrying a lot and being taken a bit for granted.

Am I being unreasonable for feeling this way? Is this normal in a household where one person is the sole provider? Would love to hear your honest opinions.

Thanks for reading, and please be honest ‚Äì I‚Äôm open to all feedback.

1gbpq5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/1gbpq5r/experience_at_shed_student_dormitory_krakow_a/,Experience at SHED student dormitory Krakow: A Warning for Future Students,"Writing this longass feedback wasn‚Äôt exactly on my bucket list, but here we are. Main reason honestly, I don‚Äôt want other students to go through the rollercoaster ride we did at SHED Dormitory Cracow. Who wants their European adventure spoiled by a bunch of unprofessional folks?

From day one, they showed us exactly what they were about. When my roommate and I asked to see some nice rooms with a view, we were met with a response that could only be described as a cold slap: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not your personal assistants.‚Äù It felt more like they were saying, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like it, good luck finding somewhere else.‚Äù But hey, maybe they just had a rough morning. We decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Once we finally settled in, that‚Äôs when the real circus began. Here‚Äôs the full rundown of the chaos:

1. Management: If you‚Äôre looking for a textbook example of customer service, look elsewhere. The management here could give a masterclass in how to ignore complaints. You could repeat your issues ten times, and it felt like you were talking to a wall. I half expect to see them at the next ‚ÄúHow Not to Manage a Dorm‚Äù seminar. Seriously, if someone in a higher position reads this, please reconsider the management you‚Äôve assigned to handle 700 students. They need a serious refresher course on how to actually help people. Let me tell you about my wild ride trying to get my payment sorted out! When I first asked them to check, they hit me with, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not your personal accountants, just throw us the check.‚Äù I mean, considering I have a contract with my name on it, checking my payment shouldn‚Äôt be rocket science, right? But hold on, it gets better! They later claimed they couldn‚Äôt see my payment at all. Instead of just asking my bank directly, they turned my life into a sitcom with all the drama and frustration. I‚Äôm practically ready to write a book titled ‚ÄúHow to Make a Simple Payment Into a Major Life Crisis.‚Äù And here‚Äôs a kicker: I found out that some of the managers are busy trying to scrub all the bad reviews. Talk about dedication!

2. Noise Levels: Now, I know dorms can be loud‚Äîtrust me, I‚Äôve been there‚Äîbut this place took it to a whole new level. I‚Äôve never heard such a party atmosphere in a study space. Imagine trying to focus on your assignments while the common area turns into a nightclub, complete with music blasting until the wee hours. ‚ÄúHey, can you guys turn it down a notch?‚Äù we kindly asked. Their reply? ‚ÄúIf it bothers you, maybe just switch rooms.‚Äù So, instead of addressing the problem, their solution was to just shove us somewhere else. I guess keeping 15 people happy is too much of a hassle. When we asked security to handle the noise situation, it was like trying to get a cat to take a bath. Good luck with that.

3. Fridge Situation: Let‚Äôs talk about the fridge situation. For the lovely price of around 3000 PLN for our room, you‚Äôd think we‚Äôd get a decent mini-fridge, right? Nope. Instead, we were gifted with a mini-fridge. Our food had to take refuge in the huge common fridge, which felt more like a game of food hide-and-seek, despite all the cameras keeping an eye on us like Big Brother; unfortunately, they were more likely made by 5-minute crafts kinds of stuff like never useful but always there. Twice, our food mysteriously disappeared. When we asked them to check the cameras, they just shrugged it off like it was no big deal. If you enjoy the game of ‚ÄúGuess Where‚Äôs My Dinner Now?‚Äù this is the place for you.

4. Room and Bed Sizes: You know those rooms they advertise for two people? Well, they clearly have a different definition of cozy. The bed size was more appropriate for one person‚Äîdefinitely not meant for two people. And guess what? No air conditioning in a brand-new 2023 building. Who needs cool air when you can just sweat it out, right? We had to buy a fan that could probably power a small country just to survive the heat. At this rate, I might as well invest in a portable sauna.

5. Walls: The walls here are practically made of tissue paper. You can hear everything. I once overheard my neighbor discussing their life choices and questionable music choices. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the sounds coming from their night dance. It was like living next to a live performance of a very questionable nature. Privacy? What‚Äôs that?

6. Safety Issues: Based on my deep dive into Google reviews, I discovered that one of the reception guys seems to have taken on the role of a reality TV producer. Apparently, this guy was caught watching the gym girls on the cameras and then knocking on doors late at night. It was like he was trying to deliver some kind of questionable service. Professional training before the job? Nope, thanks. We were charged around a lovely 3K PLN every month, and on top of that, if your guest overstayed their welcome by three days, you got hit with an extra fee for ‚Äúsecurity.‚Äù Meanwhile, they had this guest list that felt more like a bad joke than a real security measure. It‚Äôs as if they thought, ‚ÄúWho needs real safety when we can just add more fees?‚Äù Despite this being a student dorm, they turned all the empty summer rooms into hotel rooms, transforming our home into a makeshift motel where anything could happen.

Now, picture this scenario: it‚Äôs 3 AM, and you‚Äôre trying to work in a glass-walled room that‚Äôs supposed to be a sanctuary of peace. Suddenly, two middle-aged guys are banging on the glass like they‚Äôre auditioning for the next big action flick. As the reception escorted them away, they staggered down the hall, looking like they were in an eating contest gone wrong. Honestly, it was one of the most surreal sights‚Äîthese dudes were clearly under the influence of some wild kind of drugs, probably bad decisions, and way too much junk food. The receptionist said they were ‚Äúhotel guests,‚Äù which felt like a punchline to a really bad joke about 700 students secure. I wish I had Will Smith with a neuralyzer at that time; maybe it would have helped me erase that moment from my entire memory. Meanwhile, let‚Äôs talk about the security measures in place. Your friend had to wait at the door like we were auditioning for a secret society. Just put the fires on the bag, man. Named this security but let an unknown bazillion middle-aged sweet van man-type people live at the same time with students. Not cool.

Then, there was one tenant who had quite the experience in his room. Imagine this: You're in the room with confidence because you're sure you locked your door. What could happen, right? But then the cleaning lady, key card in hand, walked into your small room and saw you naked. It‚Äôs a wonder she didn‚Äôt hand him a towel and invite him in for a waltz. Don't ask why he is naked in his room.

7. Unprofessional Behavior: With the exception of a couple of lovely staff members at reception, the rest acted like they were auditioning for a soap opera with their eye rolls and dramatic sighs whenever you asked for help. It felt like they were sharing your personal info over coffee breaks just for kicks. If you need a lesson in how to not take your job seriously, this is the place to learn it. When I tried to get some basic information, it was like asking a cat for directions. So many blank stares and ignoring sounds. It was almost impressive.

8. Elevators: For over half of our stay, at least three out of the four elevators were out of service. I can‚Äôt even count how many times I ended up on the stairs, lugging my bags up and down like I was Sisyphus. If you want a workout while trying to get to your room, this place supports a healthy life. Just don‚Äôt forget your water bottle. It became a daily routine, waiting for an elevator that rarely arrived, and when it did, it was like winning the lottery.

And here‚Äôs the cherry on top: after our contract ended, they tried to sneak in a clause that basically said, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want to end up in the Bad Review Hall of Fame, keep your mouth shut.‚Äù What a creative way to avoid accountability. They even threatened me with an email after I shared my honest feedback online. It‚Äôs like they think we‚Äôre too scared to speak up in 2024.

It‚Äôs such a shame to deal with this kind of unprofessionalism, especially in a country that values freedom of speech. If only management could turn complaints into actual improvements, they‚Äôd be the talk of the town‚Äîminus the eye rolls.

I really hope no student has to go through this while trying to enjoy one of the most exciting times of their lives.

Me (28f) and my best friend (29f) have been friends since we were children, she's amazing and despite our lives going in very different directions our friendship is still as strong as it was when we sat next to each other in class every day for a decade, I love her like a sister and I want only for her to be safe and happy. She has been dating the same guy for about 7 years, sometime last year we had a talk over coffee about their relationship and she told me that they were having a few issues, the most glaring, at least to me, was that he had said he wasn't sure if he loved her enough at this stage in the relationship. To me that's a huge red flag and I naturally consoled her and asked what she felt about it, she wanted to continue the relationship and work through his insecurity, I supported the decision but secretly was rather concerned. Its both of their first proper long term relationship and my friend has been focusing on her codependency for a couple of years and I was worried she was just not willing to let him go, even after he said something that I would deem unforgiveable. 

A few months passed, I moved away for work and my friend and I spoke a bit less until early this year I got a call telling me that she was engaged, naturally I was ecstatic, I had totally forgotten about the previous issues and had chalked them up to the ""7 year itch,"" I totally clicked into maid of honour mode and started making plans for the hen party etc. 

Things were moving forward, they announced the engagement, set a date and venue, sent out save the dates, I did what I could to help from overseas, to me everything seemed fine. That is until about 2 months ago when I got a call from her that basically boiled down to the same stuff as last year, that her now Fiance was not sure he loved her enough and was insecure in his feelings and had developed a suspicious friendship with a female colleague that again was a red flag for me. In all honesty I was furious, it is one thing to have doubts in a long term relationship but it's totally another to publicly propose and plan a wedding without fully processing those fears and then dumping them on your unsuspecting fiancee when she should be enjoying wedding planning. Since then my friend and I have been having more catch ups, sometimes things seem better, sometimes worse, he's in therapy but there are other factors like them just buying a house together and changing careers that are adding to their stress. When I recently brought up something about the wedding my friend said she wasn't doing any more planning for a while because she wasn't sure there even would be a wedding. 

I am with her no matter what, but just hearing about how flip-floppy he's being is making me nervous, I don't want her to lose a lot of money and let's me honest, dignity, if the wedding is called off at short notice so I just wanted to hear from anyone who might have been in a similar position as me, have you had doubts about your friend's partner? Did you marry someone who you later found out your friend had doubts about and if so, would you have preferred they'd spoken those doubts instead of keeping them secret? 

I know it's her life and she has to make her own decisions and or mistakes but it hurts to watch her potentially making a mistake this big. ",0,1729845849.0,AskWomenOver30,9,0.5,False

I found myself obsessed with buying things to fulfil a particular 'vision' about my life living in the apartment. It's definitely not the proudest moment in my life. I spent hours researching and combing through apartment living posts/videos. 

 When I actually live in the apartment, I found that most of the things I bought wasn't needed or even fitting to the space. Now I ended up with a bunch of things I don't need. And no, I didn't actually have time drinking coffee in the morning by the balcony sitting on that rattan chair. 

The lesson I learn this time? 
I don't 'create a lifestyle' with things bought. My lifestyle is actually created by living my life as it is. It's slowly formed from solving/adding/removing things in my day to day life.

The assistant manager had a caffeine addiction- I didn't even know that was a thing, since several of my classmates drank a lot of coffee in highschool. 

I usually ordered tea or tried other sweet drinks, as I don't buy Starbucks in general. Somehow, I've been accused of being a caffeine addict and when I drink 'coffee' (any drink inside an opaque cup), it means I'm addicted or have the need to stalk someone. 

The assistant manager had a caffeine addiction- he was also a pothead, and dragged me to buy weed with him, when I said no, I don't eat weed and it's illegal from my country. That didn't get into his head. He kept saying 'You want this, so I'm buying this for you.' 

He also believed we were in a relationship because another colleague was convinced that I had a crush on him and believed she was playing matchmaker. She wouldn't leave me alone and harassed me until I agreed with whatever she said, and she recorded those conversations and showed them to HR. What's worse was that the assistant manager was already in a relationship, and called her crazy and abusive. He only asked other girls for help, and when he asked me for help, I said no and he threatened to kill himself, and when I went there, he lied about other girls going. 

The female colleague was also a stalker, and killed animals in the past. I was also accused of that. She copied everything I did, things I wore, how I did my hair, and would force me to do things I didn't want like wearing tights, drinking alcohol, etc. She claimed she was being bullied by other employees, and asked me to transfer many times to her side because she didn't have 'friends'.  After I transferred, she started to verbally abuse me and damaged my things. She also stole a lot of things from me. She also constantly threatened to kill herself. 

She also constantly talked shit about the assistant manager's girlfriend, constantly talked about her Instagram and copied her interests, and talked about sexual things a lot, and sent me a lot of sexual content on Instagram, and when I ignored her messages, she would wait in the break room and take my phone to open the messages and force me to watch them. When I stayed with her, she lied to everyone that I needed her help, when she kept asking me to rent the place with her.  She also stole things from my roommate, which damaged our relationship, and I didn't realize until I moved in with her when I saw some of my old roommate's things with her. She would often flash her body at me, and do things like taking out her vibrator, inviting the assistant manager over, and do things like tying my hands and feet together. At night, she would cut my hair, sometimes my arms, and said she was performing witchcraft because she wanted my soul. I was really scared to leave, because I was afraid she would stalk me because she constantly talked about how she was waiting for revenge on her ex or other friend to apologize, so I waited until she left first and pretended I was something she would dislike. I was also scared the assistant manager would stalk me, or say bad things about me at work because I rejected him. He kept saying things like he's never felt this way before, he can already see our life together, etc. It was really scary. 

I often saw those two after work when I went to my other job, classes or general shopping or on my breaks. I tried to think positively that it's just a coincidence, they're very popular and crowded places, I'm fine. 

If anyone knew me, knows I don't drink caffeine or alcohol, and for a reason. 

The female colleague often asked me for favours, like buying tea or alcohol for her, or getting her laundry. When I asked for the same things, I was now abusive. 

Just because I hung around them, it doesn't mean I'm like them or have the same problems as them. It's more like I was vulnerable and an easy target for them abuse. 

I've also been accused of needing to see people's front faces if I see the back of them, or vice versa. I don't know what part of psychology or disorder or whatever it is, but that is just really weird. I'm still figuring that one out. 

People also think I like people with glasses or I had an ex boyfriend with glasses, and maybe dark skin. I don't know where that information came from, as I've never been in a relationship or date, and I don't have a type. Among my previous friends, only one person wore glasses. As a result of that gossip, nowadays people wearing glasses freak me out. Especially since a lot of my colleagues, who were bullies, wore glasses at my last workplace. 

The assistant manager did this thing where he would text three emojis and tell me that it meant 'I love you'. Word got to my family that I'm problematic mentally, and my mom has been doing it to me, which is really creepy. I just agreed with everything he said because he didn't seem to understand English or was able to write anything coherent, and made everything about sex, like the female colleague. 

Anyway, I'm going to continue drinking and enjoying my hot drinks. 

Some people are so bitter and nasty that I left work. ",0,1729845653.0,offmychest,0,0.5,False

1gbpkyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/theartificialonion/comments/1gbpkyp/nation_rallies_around_man_who_heroically_kept/,Nation Rallies Around Man Who Heroically Kept Calm During 3-Minute Starbucks Delay,"SEATTLE ‚Äî In a rare show of national unity, millions of Americans have rallied behind local hero Greg Waters, 34, who managed to stay calm and collected during an unprecedented three-minute delay for his order at a downtown Starbucks on Wednesday.

Witnesses say Waters, who was waiting for his mobile order of a half-caf almond milk latte with an extra shot of espresso and just a hint of caramel drizzle, showed the kind of self-restraint typically reserved for Buddhist monks or people who meditate professionally. Despite the apparent chaos at the counter ‚Äî where a barista tragically misaligned a syrup pump, causing a massive backup ‚Äî Waters reportedly stood still, scrolling through his phone in complete silence.

""It was like watching a Zen master,"" said Ellie Gonzalez, another customer who claims she couldn‚Äôt make it through the ordeal without sighing audibly twice and muttering ""Unbelievable."" ""I looked over, and he just...stood there. Like a rock in a storm. Like he knew, deep down, that someday his latte would come.""

Observers described the scene as nothing short of miraculous. Even when his latte finally arrived, a barista mistakenly announced it as ""Gregory"" instead of ""Greg,"" and Waters merely raised an eyebrow before calmly retrieving his beverage. He didn't correct her, didn't sigh ‚Äî he simply took his latte, nodded in her direction, and left.

The heroic act has since gone viral, with social media users hailing Waters as a beacon of grace in an increasingly impatient world. The hashtag #PrayForGreg became the top trend within hours, with fans sharing memes of Waters‚Äô calm face superimposed over iconic images of stoicism, like Gandhi, the Dalai Lama, and a particularly relaxed sloth.

""Greg Waters reminds us all that patience is, indeed, a virtue,"" tweeted @HeartfeltInspo24. ""We need more heroes like Greg who don‚Äôt crack under pressure. The world could learn from him.""

Some political leaders have even taken note of Waters' self-control. ‚ÄúIn times like these, we need strong role models who can face adversity with poise,‚Äù said Senator Lindsey Harper, D-Mass. ‚ÄúGreg's quiet resilience in the face of a minor inconvenience is exactly the kind of spirit this country needs right now.‚Äù

Starbucks CEO Melody Hobson also issued a public apology and awarded Waters a lifetime supply of free refills, calling him ""an inspiration to coffee lovers and impatient customers everywhere."" The company has even begun to study Waters‚Äô tranquil demeanor, hoping to teach it to other customers who often crumble at the first sign of a wait.

But not everyone is thrilled. Barista Jake Feldman, who reportedly witnessed Waters‚Äô ordeal, feels conflicted. ‚ÄúLook, I get it, the guy was cool about it,‚Äù Feldman said, nervously glancing around the Starbucks like he might get mobbed for speaking up. ‚ÄúBut, honestly, that happens, like, twice an hour. Everyone‚Äôs acting like this guy is some kind of saint for not blowing up. Meanwhile, I haven‚Äôt taken a break since 9 a.m.‚Äù

Despite these voices of dissent, Waters remains humble. Reached for comment at his apartment, Waters downplayed his newfound fame. ‚ÄúHonestly, I just didn‚Äôt feel like flipping out,‚Äù he said, looking bewildered at the crowd gathered outside his building holding signs that read, ""Calm King"" and ""Be Like Greg.""

As of press time, Waters‚Äô neighbors reported that he had made a conscious choice to remain unbothered by the whole ordeal, proving, once again, that true heroes don‚Äôt wear capes; they wear puffer jackets and calmly wait for coffee.",1,1729845545.0,theartificialonion,0,1.0,False

Yesterday had a azoospermia report confirmed after struggling to conceive for about a year. Doctor/GP read me the result, I could tell he wasn‚Äôt a specialist and am going to try and get a formal copy of the report but what he read to me was as follows.

 

Ph ‚Äì 7.5

Volume ‚Äì normal

Sperm count ‚Äì 0 [Azoospermia]

 

No requirement to repeat the test.

 

I will be requesting a repeat noting the days leading up to the test weren‚Äôt good ‚Äì flu, stressful situations at work leading a conference, stress getting to hospital on time, etc. That said, with the report as it is, things aren‚Äôt looking great, as 0 sounds pretty conclusive.

 

Over the next few months before another test (I can trigger an independent one free of charge privately if a second NHS one gives the same results, if I even get a second test on the NHS in that timeframe), I want to do everything in my power to do things ‚Äúright‚Äù, so that the next test can be as conclusive as possible before moving to next steps.

 

These were the things I was looking to do, not all will be totally straight forward:-

* Remove alcohol intake entirely
* Minimise caffeine (tea, coffee, pepsi max) might not be possible to eliminate entirely
* Eat healthy diet, lots of fish and vegetables, less sweat treats & takeouts
* Vitamin supplement ‚Äì currently using Wellman Conception but will look to upgrade to Conception Max
* Rheal superfoods clean greens + turmeric (to remove inflammation)
* Keep hot showers to a minimum (and don‚Äôt have a hot shower pre intercourse)
* Reduce time with phone spent in jeans pocket, I am planning to remove the Pacer app off my phone which I use to track steps, so I am not tempted to take my phone out with me walking for long duration
* Moderate exercise (not to extreme) but hold a steady pattern, even though I tend to exercise less during winter months, I will try to persevere with 10,000 steps/day and some more strenuous exercise
 

Please let me know if there‚Äôs any I‚Äôve missed, and if any of the above seem over the top. Obviously difficult to know if any of above will have impact if it is genetic/caused by a blockage, but willing to do everything I can.",1,1729845129.0,maleinfertility,3,1.0,False

Vergil opened his mouth to protest the idea. A glare from Sil shut it for him.

The Oldest deflated slightly as its eyes swung from Tallah to Sil and back again. ‚ÄúYou go back on your decision?‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt given you my decision. Not yet.‚Äù She thumbed in Sil‚Äôs direction, ‚ÄúShe can go and do whatever she pleases. I'm not her. I haven‚Äôt decided if you‚Äôre worth preserving or not.‚Äù She turned and gave a long look to the library. ‚ÄúWhatever‚Äôs grown in there should be preserved. But if I leave you its caretakers, or I help the girl, remains to be seen.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill we need to convince every one of your people? Are we to be weighed always?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. If you ever get out into the wider world, you‚Äôll never be loved as you are, not on sight. So, what do you offer for my help?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you desire?‚Äù

Tallah grinned. ‚ÄúThe healing water Sil mentioned. And time in this library of yours.‚Äù

Words seemed to sting the Oldest as it drew back from her, palps raised. Its bristly hair stood on end. ‚ÄúYou cannot disturb the Knowing. You cannot break it!‚Äù

Tallah shrugged and winced, hand reaching up to her shoulder. ‚ÄúI do not aim to disturb. You may hold the books yourselves. I only mean to copy some of them.‚Äù

That calmed down the Oldest, its prickly hair smoothing over.

Luna piped up, ‚ÄúWe can give you Knowing. One bite gifts Knowing to those with no Knowing.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll pass. I don‚Äôt need your understanding of your‚Ä¶ knowing. I need my own. Deal or not, spider?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe consent to the exchange. Save us from the false mother, and we will give you anything within our power to give.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Sil, I need a tonic. You two get yourselves ready to march out.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need to do without. I can‚Äôt channel.‚Äù

Tallah‚Äôs eyebrows shot up. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean you can‚Äôt channel?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly what it sounds like. Something‚Äôs blocking me. Every time I try, I feel sick. I can‚Äôt pull in illum.‚Äù She shrugged. ‚ÄúWas hoping a purger from your store would clear it up, but it did nothing. I need to take the stud off Vergil and can‚Äôt at the moment.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen it wasn‚Äôt your trail I was following? Odd.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat trail?‚Äù Sil‚Äôs turn to look confused.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an illum leak out there. It brought me to you. Strong stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot me, no.‚Äù She turned to Vergil and gave him a long look. ‚ÄúDid the trail lead you exactly to us?‚Äù

‚ÄúA bloody, high-up balcony. From there to some clash of spiders. And then a staircase leading to that wonky forest.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like how you‚Äôre looking at me, Sil.‚Äù Vergil squirmed under the healer‚Äôs stare. It promised dissection in his near future.

‚ÄúStay here, Sil.‚Äù Tallah signalled for him to join her and they set out among the shelves. ‚ÄúSpider, tell your siblings to clear a path. I mean to head up.‚Äù

They scrambled out of the way as she led them several stories up the stairs. The library had a near infinite quality to it, as if there would always be more shelves and more stairs to climb. Tallah went up briskly, as if she weren‚Äôt tired at all.

‚ÄúThis should be far enough, I‚Äôm guessing. Hold still.‚Äù

‚ÄúWh-what for?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo I can kiss you.‚Äù She smiled sweetly, then cackled when he shuddered. ‚ÄúRight. It‚Äôs not you. I don‚Äôt feel anything coming from you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I could‚Äôve told you that.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould you, though?‚Äù She shrugged and headed back. ‚ÄúLast I checked you couldn‚Äôt feel illum. I assume nothing‚Äôs changed in that regard.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think the dwarf‚Äôs got in my head. Does it count?‚Äù

She shrugged and had the good grace of not reminding him she‚Äôd been right. Still, her dismissal of the thing made it easier to accept it as a constant presence now.

As they walked back, she pulled one of his axes out of her rend and tossed it to him. ‚ÄúHave the ghost be useful if it‚Äôs loitering about.‚Äù

And that was that. No other questions. No concerns. The rock was back even as blood seeped into the back of her shirt.

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs your forehead bleeding?‚Äù Tallah asked when rejoining Sil and the Oldest.

‚ÄúBugger. Not again,‚Äù Sil pressed a hand to the cut and smudged blood. ‚ÄúThought this cleared up.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe received a message from her goddess,‚Äù Vergil put in while Sil launched a stream of angry cussing that made his ears heat up. ‚ÄúSaid she‚Äôs watching and coming.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got marked?‚Äù Tallah looked more carefully at the blushing healer.

‚ÄúYes. I don‚Äôt know why and I don‚Äôt know what it meant. Kept getting some strange pulses since. They hurt.‚Äù

‚ÄúNever heard of your goddess descending on one of you in the field. I thought punishment generally meant you‚Äôd get struck dead or some such.‚Äù

Sil shrugged and threw her hands in the air, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand anything of what happened since we got in here. I just can‚Äôt channel.‚Äù

Tallah‚Äôs eyes narrowed. She flinched back a moment later as if struck.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in here. You‚Äôre the source. Pulling next to you is like dipping a hand in molten rock.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it poisonous?‚Äù

‚ÄúFar from it. Dense more like. Intense. Like elend coffee compared to human.‚Äù She raised a hand and opened a small rend to extract a cloth bag from inside. ‚ÄúNo tonic means I‚Äôll make due with coffee. Where can I boil some water in here?‚Äù

One of the spiders provided copper mugs from some hidden alcove above. They smelled of something long-ago turned to dust.

Tallah and Sil continued their conversation from earlier while Vergil washed and filled their mugs. He objected to some of what he was hearing, especially with regards to Ludwig, but couldn‚Äôt find the heart to voice his concerns.

Yes, Ludwig had done something monstrous. His abandonment of Tallah wouldn‚Äôt endear his case to either woman. No matter what sort of defence Vergil considered for the old man, this betrayal of their trust wasn‚Äôt something even he could forgive or understand. More and more he found himself coming back to Tallah‚Äôs polarising way of thinking.

He knew one thing for certain: the spiders deserved to live. Yes, they‚Äôd done something terrible. But they weren‚Äôt terrible in themselves. Luna wasn‚Äôt. The Oldest wasn‚Äôt. Maybe the library ones weren‚Äôt either. Or the ones that were dying in that pit down there, in pain and fear of something much more terrifying than them.

How could he help?

Sil had chewed him out about interfering, but he found himself talking when handing out the coffee.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you take the soul of the girl?‚Äù he asked Tallah. ‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ you did with the one on your back?‚Äù

She shook her head while heating the mugs. Steam curled in the air, and the aroma of fresh coffee drove away some of the old scents.

‚ÄúI need her given name and parentage. And I need to get close to where her core self is. Who knows how she‚Äôs spread out among the spiders.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have her name.‚Äù

She waggled a finger. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt. Egia is a calling. The School hands new names to its healers when taking them in. Erisa is, likely, not her birth name either.‚Äù She gave Sil a long look and then went on, ‚ÄúIn all honesty, I agree the idea could work. Probably. I have two more gems and am willing to sacrifice one for an Egia‚Äôs soul.‚Äù

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt the ability genetic?‚Äù Sil tied a wad of gauze against her wound to staunch the persistent bleeding. It refused closing even after downing an *accelerant.* ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs got anything to do with any mindscape.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine bloody question. It was never studied properly. But, even if it is‚Ä¶‚Äù Tallah grinned and stuck out her tongue. It forked at the end and wiggled. ‚ÄúWe have a blood mage among us.‚Äù

Sil nearly spat out her coffee. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that. One more time and I promise you won‚Äôt even know the name of the poison I‚Äôll douse you with. Bloody gross.‚Äù

It got a cackle out of Tallah.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what are we doing then? Just kill every spider infected?‚Äù Vergil went on, sitting with them on the bare rock.

‚ÄúPretty much. I have a theory regarding the girl‚Äôs body, but I need to reach it. And I need the Ikosmenia to confirm it. All in all, Ludwig first. Body second. A lot of fire third or in-between.‚Äù Tallah downed her entire steaming mug. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôd best get to it fast.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you grinning like that?‚Äù

Half of Tallah‚Äôs face was stuck in an ugly half-rictus, teeth showing clenched. She massaged it with the heel of her palm until back to normal.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to keep happening. Christina‚Äôs got Anna subdued, but the witch is strong. Subdued or not, she‚Äôs still trying to wiggle free. At one point I‚Äôll need to deal with her in truth before she breaks out of confinement.‚Äù She cracked her knuckles and rolled her shoulders. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get those doors open and move out. No time serves like the now.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm useless at the moment,‚Äù Sil said. ‚ÄúMay as well go on without me.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot happening. Move your ass. You‚Äôre my secret *battery* right now.‚Äù Tallah threw Vergil a grin. And a wink? ‚ÄúI used that right, yes?‚Äù

He laughed. She was so calm about heading into imminent danger. By her words, the creature down there had her dead to rights. Now, she looked forward to facing it again, grinning like a fool.

And what of the fucking girl?!

*We‚Äôll figure it out when we get to it* seemed like poor planning to him.

No matter. If she didn‚Äôt mind their chances of survival, why would he? He got to his feet, stretched and popped his joints, and accepted the vials Sil handed out.

‚ÄúIf you get bit, drink the green one immediately,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf you get hurt, the amber. I‚Äôd give you a flask, but you don‚Äôt know the quantity so you‚Äôre likely to poison yourself with it. Be careful with these. Tallah already broke some, and we‚Äôre on the back end of our stock.‚Äù

He stowed the flasks well, as protected as they were likely to be on someone that was going to end up fighting eight-legged monsters. No offence intended to those present, of course.

Luna climbed up to his shoulder and gripped tight. ‚ÄúWe will guide. We will help if we can.‚Äù

Help with what? Tallah was going by instinct. Solve what comes when it comes. It‚Äôll all be fine. It hadn‚Äôt so far, but why let technicalities slow them down? A bad plan was still a plan.

Except they had no plan, bad or otherwise.

1gbph4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1gbph4g/am_i_being_sensitivedramatic/,Am I being sensitive/dramatic?,"I am a stay at home mum with 2 under 3. I solo parent most days while my husband works until 7pm/9pm. 

I wake up in the morning with both my kids and try to get them ready and start their routine. But then, before I‚Äôve even brushed my teeth or washed my face I get a call. Guess who it‚Äôs from!! My MOTHER IN LAW. Then I also get a call, FROM MY GRANDMA!!! then I get a call FROM MY OWN MOTHER. 

Every day. 
I am tired. Why do you need to ring me every single day??? 

Yesterday I didn‚Äôt answer my mother in laws call. I now have anxiety about that because it‚Äôs going to be awkward when I next see her or she calls again or I call. Ugh. 


The other day my mum came over. She saw my toddlers hair (nothing wrong with her hair) and my mum said ‚Äúyou should cut her hair and give her a bob cut because it‚Äôs going in her eyes and she doesn‚Äôt let you tie it‚Äù. 

I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not cutting her hair it‚Äôs fine‚Äù 

In the back of my mind I kind of thought about giving her a full fringe. 
I asked my toddler if she wanted one later on and she really didn‚Äôt. So I left it. 

The next day I asked her again and tried to make it fun so she was like okay kinda. 
So I tried to cut it in the bath. I half cut it, and then she wanted me to stop because she was tired and just not in the mood. So when she was sleeping I straightened it up. It looks very pretty on her. And she‚Äôs had fringes before. She had one last year. 

But now she‚Äôs older and more aware. When she woke up I told her I fixed her fringe while she was sleeping and she was happy and said ‚Äòooooo!‚Äô 

Anyway, I was brushing her hair and she told me she doesn‚Äôt want a fringe so she just moved it back. Which is fine she can move it back and it doesn‚Äôt even look too bad. I just feel upset because, I feel like what if I cut her fringe and she doesn‚Äôt like it? Or is it something she will like over time? What do I do?

Like I said she‚Äôs had them before but she wasn‚Äôt aware. Now she knows she has a fringe and she‚Äôs not used to it so she pushes it back. 

I did this for her because she hates wearing bobbles and anything in her hair because she likes to lay down during the day. And her hair did go in her eyes a lot. So to prevent that I cut her fringe. But why do I feel so guilty? I literally had pure intentions and to do it for her. And yes I do find them cute. But I wanted my angel to be cute and comfortable without having to wear bobbles she hates, or headbands! And to be able to see properly without having hair in her face!!


Anyway, this is the part that made me so angry and cry this morning. 
My mum came over this morning to pick up my toddler because she had a doctors appointment and I don‚Äôt drive so she was taking her. 
She saw my son and was like shall I take him too! So I was like yeah okay because I have a lotttt of housework to do! 
(Deep down I didn‚Äôt really want them both to go but it‚Äôs fine) I kind of wanted my daughter to go to her appointment then come back home. But now they‚Äôre both going to stay there until 4pm ://
Which is okay. Fine. I don‚Äôt drive so I guess it‚Äôs not my choice. 

Anyway, as we were getting my toddler ready my mum says ‚Äúyou should cut the back of her hair too it‚Äôs getting long‚Äù. 

I then got really irritated! And I said to my mum. I am not cutting her hair. 
When is it ever going to be enough for you? Can you please stop picking at everything. 

Then she said ‚Äúdid you cut her fringe for me? Because I asked you to?‚Äù I said no not really I wanted to do it anyway but you don‚Äôt stop. Always on the next thing just leave it. 

Then it got a bit awkward. 

Anyway, before my mum came I quickly cleaned the living room and moved the coffee table with last nights plates on there. My kitchen was and still is a mess while I‚Äôm typing this. 

My husband got home from work at 9pm. The kids slept at like 8:30. So while the kids slept I quickly made dinner. He got home and we ate dinner. He was so tired that he actually fell asleep on the sofa in the same spot after eating dinner :( 


So the living room looked clean when she walked in, the kitchen however, was not. I mean, it wasn‚Äôt thaaaat bad. But even when it‚Äôs clean it‚Äôll never ever be something she would compliment or say anything nice about. So I went into the kitchen with my daughter and my mum followed us. And she looked around and said woooo what‚Äôs happened in here? Is this from last night? I felt the judgment in her voice!!!!! I didn‚Äôt even know what to say. If I were at someone‚Äôs house I would never ever say anything like that. It‚Äôs so rude?

For Figures of Speech prompts, I gave a free parameters, including the word length of 500-1000 words and the prompts for a few of the Fifty mentioned in the series.

I gave the AI creative license and let's just say, they're a long way off from replacing the better writers and I think it just makes it easier to do those lower level tasks and let's leave the creators a slightly higher level of skill to create actual tangible and engaging writing.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response‚Äîor lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly‚Äîthe Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out?

I quit cold turkey 3 years ago and have not consumed any coffee until 3 weeks ago. In those 3 years I sometimes drank a coke but immediately felt the caffeine rush and I did not like it. Mainly because, during the time I drank coffee I was having severe problems with anxiety and sometimes panic, also dizziness, vertigo, and really bad hypochondria. I mean, I was constantly worried about everything, especially my health.

Going to malls gave me anxiety, a lot of people gave me anxiety, everything gave me anxiety. I quit coffee and starting after 2 weeks all of those symptoms went away and I was a complete different human being. I never worried, or anything.

However, my wife started drinking coke everyday. I kind off got me hooked again. Starting with cokes here and there, then every day. At office, when feeling unmotivated I decided to make a real light latte coffee with a lot of milk and just a tiny shot of coffee. The increase in concentration and focus was intense. I liked it. I could finish more work in same time.

Anyway, now I start to feel again like the old symptoms are coming back. I feel this constant tension headache since morning. I had one regular coffee yesterday, and actually every day 1 cup for 3 weeks now. I am thinking of quitting. But I am worried about those symptoms now. I mean, I have extreme mood swings in the morning that are new to me. I feel irritated, angry, frustrated, anxious. Just because I had no coffee since yesterday? Its 11:30am now. I wont consume any caffeine further on, at least for 6 weeks. Then maybe here and there a coke again just if needed to battle tiredness.

What I am wondering about are those symptoms. I mean they are pretty severe at the moment although I have only drank a coffee on a daily basis for three weeks now. Are symptoms of withdrawal getting worse if you have a situation like I do?",1,1729844902.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

One day the teacher posted a story with me because we're friends and she followed me after the story.  

Since then she has been liking ALL my stories, like ALL of them, and everytime we meet in class she smiles at me and starts talking to me, we even leave together (mainly because we share the same trainline). So I thought: it seems she's interested in me, so let's give it a shot. I texted her to go get some coffee, and she said that would be great. 

A couple days later, I texted her again to set up the time and spot we would meet, to which she responded: sorry I'm not free on wednesday. I answered something like: no worries, let me know when works for you. She liked the message and that was it. 

More information: she keeps liking all my stories, and coming up to me in dance class.

Any advice on how to proceed? Or should I just forget about it?",2,1729844465.0,datingadviceformen,2,1.0,False
