1lvjo72,https://i.redd.it/4r9nokl3tubf1.jpeg,There are beautiful moments that sneak in between the awful reality that is life.  It's all hard.  All of it.  The beautiful moments make what we endure bearable.,"I'm no philosopher but finding my voice in a sea of bro pod casts and toxic positivity advice is frustrating.  I've got things to say but the noise.  Oh the noise out there.  It's all low key terrorism.

Life is hard and anybody telling you that it isn't is a fucking asshole.  All of it is hard.  Growing up.  Parents.  Family.  Relationships. Work. Marriage.  Kids.  And the list goes on.  We are best when we are present enough to identify the beautiful moments that appear when we least expect it.

I love our life and as corny as it sounds, I love our dogs.  You want a mainline to joy and happiness, spend some time with a dog.

This morning, she and I had coffee on the couch at 5:30am.  Two dogs between us with their heads in our laps.  I reached over and touched her hand and I looked down at my dog and he was staring at me.  We were all quiet.  She smiled at me and said, ""That dog loves you so much.""

I'll take that beautiful moment and let it fuel and inspire my day today while I battle the hell that we call life today.  I'll listen to grown men act like spoiled children.  I'll listen to women bitch and moan about the most mundane things with a forced smile.  I'll fix 20 to 30 problems for others.  I'll process millions of dollars of orders and survive this day.  I'll survive it.

I'll come home tonight and the first things I will see will be the dogs.  They will greet me as if I've been gone for weeks.  She will greet me and give me a hug and a kiss.  She won't ask how my day was and it took years for her to stop asking that one question and I love her for that.

I'll take as many beautiful moments as I can get with the time we have left.",1,1752069961.0,WhiskeyLoveAndLies,0,1.0,False

1lvjnzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1lvjnzy/food_noise/,Food Noise,"I IF 18/6  (most days are 19/5) a week and a half ago, and my body is enjoying it so far. My eating window length depends on whether I'm going to the gym or what else I have going on. My issue is food noise. I still think about food all the time, regardless of whether I'm hungry or not. My eating window is in the afternoon/evening, and I think about food from the time I get up until I open my window. I get hungry starting in the morning (my days begin at 4:00 am), and of course, it's worse. I only drink water and black coffee and power through it. 

I first IF 18/6 - 20/4 in 2019, and I did it clean non-stop for five years, and it was great for my body, though the food noise was still loud daily, so it wasn't something I ""got over"". Due to unregulated stress (layoffs, etc.), I slowly became sloppy with my cleanliness (using flavored sparkling water), and I overate within my eating window, leading to weight gain during a 20/4 schedule. I stopped a year ago in the spring and thought counting calories would be my ticket. 

I recently realized that I have to start over, and what I thought I was doing, I concluded that the food noise will always be there, regardless of whether I do or not. 

With that said, does anyone else have this issue with constant noise? Do you power through it? ",1,1752069949.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

1lvjkhk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lvjkhk,Thai Chili Paste,"Hello Hot Sauce Community,

I wanted to share a banger of a recipe, Thai chili paste. Add a spoonful to a sauce, stir fry, curry, or marinade for an umami and spice bomb. It has spice, but is not too spicy. The flavors from the ferment take my regular curries and make them taste like I've been laboring all day. I try to balance the flavors of spice vs spicy, and pepper vs herbaceous. 

**Ingredients:**

1 bag of Thai chilis (about the size of a coffee bag)

3"" nob of ginger

8 cloves garlic

2 stems lemongrass

1/2 to 1 small white onion

1/4 daikon radish (roughly the size of a door nob) Daikon is the pungent herbaceous back on this paste, so if you don't like it, add less.

1 red bell pepper - adds pepper flavor without the heat

Brine (4 cups water + 5 tsp non-iodized salt)

(optional) honey or sugar after the ferment

**Process:**

De-stem the peppers, add to jar. I did not de-seed. They should be 50-66% of the space, depending on how much spice you want. Add ginger, garlic and lemongrass. Cover with the radish and bell pepper. Halve the onion and pack it in last to hold the smaller ingredients below. Add brine, add weight, let ferment. I let mine go one week, then blended the ingredients with about 1/2-1 cup of the reserved brine. Add honey or sugar here for some sweetness to taste. Pop in the fridge. Next time I may add some cilantro here as well.

Enjoy!

Not a special sandwich — just turkey and mustard, slapped together with one of those sad slices of tomato that already looks like it gave up. I was eating it on the bench near 5th and Maple when **she** sat down beside me.

She wore eight coats, all of them smelling like soup and secrets. Her name, she claimed, was **Brenda**, but I didn’t believe her. Brenda had a shopping cart filled with yarn, half a toaster, and — for reasons never explained — a single goldfish in a plastic takeout container.

“You look like someone who could use a mom,” she said.

I laughed. That was my first mistake.

**Two days later, she was living in my apartment.**

How? I have no idea. One morning I left for work, and when I came home, she was in my kitchen making meatloaf with stuff I *know* I didn’t own — like ground beef, which I can’t afford.

“You didn’t lock the window,” she said, as if that made this whole thing normal. “So I climbed in. You're welcome.”

I should’ve called the cops. I know that. But she reminded me of a raccoon in a housecoat: too chaotic to be threatening, too confident to question. She insisted on doing my laundry (poorly) and started labeling my things with masking tape that said “OUR STUFF.”

Even my toothbrush.

**Then she took my job.**

I don’t know how. One day I showed up to work and my boss said, “Tell your mom she did a great job on that sales pitch.”

I said, “My *what* did *what*?”

“She closed that seven-thousand-dollar account this morning.”

Turns out Brenda had shown up in my clothes (which she somehow made fit), pitched some nonsense about eco-conscious data platforms, and walked out with a commission *and* a free lunch. My manager adored her.

Brenda just winked when I confronted her. “Moms provide. You’re welcome.”

**Next, she took my friends.**

Every Friday night, my group plays board games. They used to call me the “devious mastermind.” Now they called me “Brenda’s roommate.”

She made nachos, told stories about living on a tugboat with a guy named ""Knife Pete,"" and had my friends in stitches. At one point, she leaned over to me and whispered, “This is what bonding looks like. Try it sometime.”

That night, my best friend texted, *“Hey, is Brenda coming next week?”*

Not me. Just Brenda.

**And finally… she took my therapist.**

We had our usual Tuesday Zoom session, but instead of Dr. Rowley’s face, it was Brenda’s.

“I told her to take a week off,” Brenda said, sipping tea out of my mug. “So I’m filling in. Let’s talk about your fear of commitment and how you never recycle.”

I should’ve been mad.

But… I talked. And she listened. Really listened. Like a raccoon that also had a degree in maternal chaos.

**Then she was gone.**

I woke up one morning to find a sticky note on the fridge:

>

The apartment was spotless. My laundry folded. A new suit in my closet. Job secure. She even upgraded my coffee machine somehow.

And taped to the TV:

>

It’s been six months. Brenda sightings are rare but legendary.

Someone said they saw her in Albuquerque, giving TED Talks from a stolen milk crate.

Another claimed she runs a nonprofit called “Homes Not Phones.”

But me? I keep her goldfish in a proper bowl. Named it “Brenda Jr.”

And every once in a while, when I forget to recycle or skip therapy, I swear I can hear her voice in the walls:

>

**Moral of the story:**  
Sometimes, life sends you a hobo mom to tear everything apart…  
…just so you can build something better.

Are these really the artists defining rave culture now—DJs with mainstream Spotify hits, multimillion-dollar managers, and booking agencies pushing events with Live Nation?

Today I got an email from Hot Honey Sundays talking about that recent New York Times article claiming “dance music is booming again,” and honestly it got me thinking. HHS pointed out how dance music is now sharply divided between genuine community parties and corporate mega-events. Gray Area raised similar points on their Instagram.

But here’s the truth: almost every collective we used to admire as underground is now part of this same corporate machine. Book Club Radio, once fresh and underground, now managed by Wasserman and booked through Live Nation. Golden Record opened Signal, another packaged club venue. Resolute, legendary for illegal warehouse raves, now does fully legal events at their own spot, Holo. Gray Area hosts rooftop parties at Superior Ingredients, and even Hot Honey Sundays itself went from a scrappy BYOB waterfront event to venues like KDC, Elsewhere, Mirage, and now operates a permanent venue (BK Backyard) in Greenpoint.

And then we have the recent Brooklyn Mirage fiasco—an entire summer canceled due to greed, lack of planning, permits denied, total collapse. It’s not just one venue failing; it’s symbolic of a culture that lost itself chasing profit and mainstream appeal.

Many here have never really experienced underground rave culture anyway. Paying 20k for a plug-and-play camp at Burning Man doesn’t make you a rave explorer—it just means you’re rich.

If we keep politely standing in lines, hyping Spotify-friendly DJs, and quietly requesting refunds when corporate venues collapse, we’re complicit in the disappearance of what rave used to mean.

Maybe the Mirage disaster is finally the wake-up call we needed. Maybe it’s time to stop being consumers and start reclaiming the real culture we once loved.

Preferably close to Clintonville. I'm looking for suggestions! I'm also going to get a little rant in, thanks in advance 

The morning hours 7-9am are our hardest. We can only go on so many morning walks, lately it's been so hot, humid, and rainy so we couldnt even do that consistently. At least a couple times a week, we take breakfast to a park and eat and play outside until like 10am. Usually we go to the whetstone area and do stuff outside until the library finally opens at 9am, then we move inside to the toddler area for a while. Also, the kids at the rec center camps take over the playgrounds around 9am and it's too much for my one year old so we always have to leave by then anyway...

So, where can we go early? I'd love to sip coffee while my kid goes feral in a play area at 7am but that doesnt seem like it exists near me? 

I know about the crooked can in Hilliard being kid friendly and they have a coffee thing in there, but that's like a 30 minute drive across town in the morning rush. It's nice to go occasionally, but not on a super regular basis.

I totally get it; he’s always been super passionate about coffee, roasting techniques, sourcing beans, he can talk for hours. He’s been saving up and working odd freelance gigs to fund this dream, but he’s still about $10,000 short to get things off the ground.

A couple of weeks ago, he pitched the idea to me in full detail. I listened, and honestly, it sounds like a solid concept, local, ethically sourced beans, cool branding, small-batch vibes. But when he asked if I could invest $10k, I felt my stomach drop.

For context, I work in IT, and while I make a decent living, I’ve been putting money aside for a few years because I dream of moving out of my parents’ house and finally getting my own place. That money is basically my security blanket and the foundation of my future plans.

I told him I support him 100%, but I just can’t put that much money into something so uncertain right now. Since then, he’s been distant. He hasn’t replied to my texts the same way, and we haven’t hung out like we usually do.

I feel awful. He keeps implying that if I really believed in him, I’d take the leap. But I can’t help but feel that mixing friendship and money like this is a dangerous path.

I keep questioning if I made the right choice or if I’m being selfish. I love my friend and want him to succeed, but risking my future feels too big a price to pay.

I’ve been looking at the Philips Barista Espresso machine and it’s coming out to about $180 USD ($205 with tax). 

I only drink americanos and iced coffee—would this be a good fit?

Some reviews say it’s “really bad,” but I’m unsure if those are legit. I’ve also checked out pricier models, but hear they can break easily. My favorite part about the Philips model is the 2-year warranty—seems like a smart safeguard.

1lvj8rj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NeckSad2133/comments/1lvj8rj/the_train_that_skipped_midnight/,The Train That Skipped Midnight,"It started with a misread train schedule.

Elliot was on his way home from a conference in a city he barely knew. The schedule taped to the cracked wall of the station clearly read: **“Last train: 11:47 PM”**. But somehow, the clock in the terminal said it was 12:03 AM.

“Great,” he muttered, kicking his suitcase lightly. The platform was empty—eerily so. Not a single other soul around. No train in sight. No announcements. Not even a janitor sweeping up discarded coffee cups. Just silence.

And then, the sound.

A low rumble. Not thunder. It was mechanical. Gritty. Metallic.

He turned to look down the tracks. From deep in the tunnel, lights flickered. And then, impossibly, a train emerged—sleek, silent, and silver. It looked… *new*. Too new. Like something from ten years in the future. There were no logos, no destination signs, just a single glowing number above the conductor’s window: **12:00**.

It slowed to a stop with a whisper. Doors slid open. Elliot blinked.

Inside, the train looked immaculate. Velvet seats, polished brass handles, soft golden lights. Classical music floated gently from invisible speakers.

He stepped in.

No one else was aboard. Not the conductor. Not a single passenger. The doors slid shut behind him.

As the train began to move, Elliot tried to check his phone. No signal. No Wi-Fi. Not even a clock on the wall. He sat down, unsure whether to be concerned or curious.

The train moved faster—unnaturally fast. Trees blurred by the window until they became indistinguishable smears of green and black. Then—stars. Somehow, the landscape outside shifted. He saw stars, nebulae, planets swirling in vivid colors.

“What the hell…?”

The train wasn’t underground. It wasn’t above ground either. It was… *between*.

And then came the voice. Calm. Mechanical. But not robotic—*warm*, even.

>

Elliot stood up, spinning in place. “Who said that?”

>

The train slowed. The lights dimmed. Outside the window, a scene materialized—a small apartment in Brooklyn. It was Elliot, five years younger, laughing with someone. A girl. Lena. His ex.

He watched as his younger self hesitated over a phone call—then pressed *decline*. Lena turned away, disappointed. He remembered this moment. He chose work. Again. She’d left a month later.

>

Elliot stepped toward the door, hand outstretched. But the doors didn’t open.

>

Before he could ask more, the scene faded.

The train rushed ahead once more.

Scene two: Elliot at a crossroads in his career. An offer to start his own design firm… and another to take a cushy executive job at a massive tech company. He’d chosen the second. Safe. Profitable. But ultimately, passionless.

>

Elliot sat back down, shaken. “What is this place?”

>

One final stop.

The train slowed to a scene that hadn’t happened yet. An older Elliot, alone. The apartment was bigger. He had money. Awards. A nice view. But no one else.

Not a single voice but his own.

>

Elliot stood, hand pressed to the window, breath fogging the glass. “Is it too late?”

The voice paused.

>

Elliot blinked. “Return? But how?”

The train slowed again. A soft *ding*. The doors opened. The station outside was exactly as it had been when he arrived.

Rain slicked the concrete. His watch read 11:46 PM.

The regular 11:47 train screeched into the station.

He looked back into the silver car. It was empty now. No lights. Dust on the seats, as if it hadn’t been used in years.

Elliot turned and ran—onto the real train. Heart pounding.

He took a seat, phone in hand.

Before the doors closed, he did something strange.

I've had a hard time getting in laps after work this week. Nothing crazy, just life stuff. So this morning I decided to wake up a bit early and get in some laps in before I had to head to work.   
  
I was in a nice little rhythm, about 8 laps in and finding small optimizations every lap when I came across a rolling roadblock holding up a line of cars. In the distance I saw both cars go for a move, but then one at a time they pulled over and reset to the pits. Odd, I thought. This should've been my sign.

As I get closer, I realize he's on his outlap. Cold tires. No problem, I think. I'm coming in hot as we head into Les Combes and make my move on the right. Suddenly, he late-brakes and chops down like he's defending a world championship, catching me completely off guard. He didn't do anything wrong, but it was... aggressive for a practice session, especially on cold tires.   
  
In a practice session, I normally pull over and let people by when I'm on my outlap. I don't want to interfere with whatever they are working on.

We get to Turn 8, and I try a clean move on the inside. He slams the door again. At this point, I'm thinking, Okay, this feels intentional. Fine. I back off, tuck in behind him, and wait.

As we entered Turn 9, he ran a bit wide and drove into the gravel. Perfect chance to get by, right? I swung left to overtake, and I pull along his side, but he swerves at me. I quickly switch back to the right, and he mirrored, clearly trying to block.

It was too early, I hadn't had my coffee, and I just couldn't comprehend why this guy was defending for his life in a practice session where he was clearly slowing everyone down.

So, as we entered Pouhon, I tucked my nose right under his rear quarter panel I gave him a tap. The ol' spin-a-rooni.

Not my finest moment. I've never intentionally spun someone before other than goofing around with friends in hosted sessions. I know the sporting code applies even in practice. If I get protested, I deserve it. You should never intentionally wreck somebody. But man... seriously?

Anyway, thanks for hearing my confession. I feel better now. 🤣

I know this type of question has been asked to death, but I’ve seen some fantastic advice on previous threads and hoping you’ll be kind enough to help us out too!

My partner and I (both in our late 20s) are relocating from Scotland to Wellington in the near future. I’ve got a job lined up in the CBD, and we’re starting to look into accommodation options. We’ve reached out to a few letting agents and are trying to line up some viewings for when we arrive - but ideally, we’d like to narrow our focus to a few specific districts before diving in.

Here’s a bit about us:

- We both love good food (who doesn’t). Anything from casual bites to good coffee to the occasional splurge.
- We enjoy being active - gym, hiking, and long walks are all a regular part of our routine.
- My partner’s originally from California, so beaches, coastal walks, and nice sunsets are a big plus for her.
- I’d like some more stuff on the social side - pubs and maybe a new hockey team to join are a bonus for me. 

We’ve been eyeing Mount Victoria and have a budget of around $700/week for rent. Is this budget/location in line with our lifestyle expectations? What are some other suburbs we should consider? Anywhere we should avoid looking?

We’d really appreciate any insights!

So I'm looking at grabbing either the KM5 or the Ode 2.   My assumption is that both give excellent high-quality grind for the MM.  The difference-maker for me is the auto shutoff for the Ode 2.   Right now, I use the Oxo.  The timer is fine in principle, but I find that I weigh the grind every day anyway.  So it's no added work to weight the beans before grinding.

  
Curious about anyone's experience with the auto shutoff in the Ode 2.   Is it as simple as weigh the beans and push the button?  Because that's what I'm after here.

I (37F) am the youngest of three girls. My retired parents are divorced. They have been separately helping us three out financially, but all in very different ways and amounts. To be clear i, and I don't think my sisters either have ever asked for financial gifts or help - I think my parents are just at that age now where they have excess money and want to see it being used. 
I'll be frank, they give me the most BY FAR. I've raised it a few times that it's not fair on my sisters, but this is the reasoning my mum gave: 
- i'm the closest to them. I call and text everyday, take my children to see them every week, will buy them lunch/coffees impromptu, drop in etc. My elder sister literally never reaches out to her, and my eldest will call once every couple of weeks. 
- I'm the one that looks after them. They have both had lots of hospital stints and health issues. I'm the one that takes them for appointments, checks in on them, stays with them, has driven them to hospital at all hours, is the emergency contact, knows the medical history etc. 
- I'm the ear. I'm the person that they both confide in - everyone needs someone to talk to, and for my parents i'm that person. 
The other aspect is that my sisters are awesome, but I guess fiery towards my parents. Quick to start fights, insult them etc. There's a lot of trauma there, we all went through hell when my parents were together and the divorce was brutal. For my sisters they still hold a lot of anger that they need to work through. 
The final aspect I guess is that i'm doing the worst financially. I'm not doing badly! I'm a sahm and my husband works a good regular job! But my sisters are better off financially. My eldest sister is a millionaire (she's worked incredibly hard for her success), and my other sister is also a sahm but her husband works a high paying job and they own two homes. 
Anyway, long post. I just want to know how older parents see giving to your children. I have young babies and it's hard to not picture giving to them equally, but is that just the reality when kids grow up. Is this fair or not fair? ",1,1752067504.0,AskOldPeopleAdvice,0,0.67,False

1lviov4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lviov4/reveal_the_nespresso_vertuo_pop_singleserve/,Reveal the Nespresso Vertuo POP+ Single-Serve Brewer review worth your attention,"Testing out the Nespresso BNV121DGR1BUC1 Vertuo POP+ by Breville, Dark Grey has been a genuinely fun and caffeine-fueled journey. After spending some time with this espresso machine, I can say that it adds both convenience and a bit of flair to any coffee lover’s routine. Imagine waking up groggy but knowing your cup of joy will be ready in just minutes with minimal effort, thanks to a machine that almost reads your mind (or in this case, your coffee pod). 

**Design and Build Quality**  
Compact and stylish, this coffee maker immediately caught my eye with its sleek Dark Grey finish. The minimalistic design means it doesn’t dominate your kitchen counter. As someone with a small apartment kitchen, I appreciate how space-saving it is. The side-accessible water tank is particularly genius—it’s not only practical but makes refilling less of a chore. What really impressed me was that the machine is made from 35% recycled plastic. It adds a nice eco-friendly touch to the overall build, which I feel is more necessary in appliances today.

**Ease of Use and Automation**  
This is where the magic happens! It’s no exaggeration to say that the Vertuo POP+ takes most of the guesswork out of brewing coffee. With the one-touch operation and automatic pod recognition, it reads the barcode on each Vertuo capsule to adjust brewing parameters like water temperature, coffee quantity, and more. This might sound super techy, but all you have to do is pop in a pod, press a button, and wait. The fully automatic system ensures consistent results, which is a godsend if, like me, you're not a morning person. 

[Check Nespresso BNV121DGR1BUC1 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0cs6zm7x9/)

**Versatility in Coffee Brewing**  
Variety is a big deal for me, and this machine delivers on that front. Whether you’re in the mood for a quick espresso or a tall, refreshing cold brew, it has you covered. It brews 5 cup sizes, ranging from 5 oz for a shot of espresso to 12 oz when you're nursing your morning coffee over a Zoom call. The added ability to make iced coffee is a bonus that I didn’t expect to rely on—until I used it almost daily during the summer! 

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
The coffee machine, thankfully, doesn’t add much hassle when it comes to cleaning. The removable tank is straightforward to wash, and the reusable filter option makes me feel less guilty about waste (while still allowing for my daily caffeine fix). However, I should mention that a few reviews have pointed out issues with the coffee drips occasionally missing the cup due to misalignment, and it happened to me once or twice. It’s a minor inconvenience but worth noting if you’re looking for flawless performance.

**Advantages**  
- Compact and stylish for small spaces  
- Easy one-touch brewing with automatic pod recognition  
- Versatile coffee options, from espresso to iced coffee  
- Eco-conscious design made from recycled materials  

**Shortcomings**  
- Occasional misalignment causing spills  
- Limited to Vertuo pods, which may not be budget-friendly  
- Noisy while brewing, particularly for larger cup sizes  

**Product Alternatives**  
Comparing this brewer to its market rivals like the Keurig K-Café or the original Nespresso Pixie, it boasts more modern automation and diversity in drink sizes. While the Keurig models shine with their compatibility with a broader range of pods, they lack the uniquely specific customization and crema that the Vertuo POP+ offers. On the other hand, older Nespresso machines might be slightly quieter, but they don’t match the aesthetic or versatility here. If you’re after great espresso over compatibility, this might be the better fit for you.

**Price Performance**  
Though specific pricing isn’t set in stone, the features and innovations on this machine justify the cost relative to competitors. You're essentially paying for ease of use, a sleek design, and an automated process that saves time. For an espresso machine of this caliber, I think it's worth considering for those who don’t mind sticking to the Vertuo pod ecosystem.

DISCLAIMER:

***This post is NOT about how to solve Prelims questions but about how to learn from PYQs, how to do research on PYQs and to understand themes and pattern which are repeated in UPSC prelims ***


Hi, I have cleared UPSC IFS prelims cutoff 3 times, CSE Prelims cutoff 4 times. I have been selected in Indian Forest Services (IFS) this year.

I recently made a post on - Mistakes that SERIOUS aspirants makes. Many people asked me in DM how do you do brainstorming on PYQs.


In this post, I have taken 5 questions. I have not cherry-picked them. I just saw the 2025 paper and picked Q1, Q25, Q50, Q75, Q100.

I have not attempted 2025 UPSC, did not see the paper before this. I have not seen any analysis of this year's paper. This post is about how I approach Prelims PYQs in the PYQ book (not in the exam hall) when I see them the very first time.


Analysis is done in four parts. First two parts will help you gather the knowledge (80% work) and last two parts will help you understand the pattern of UPSC questions.

1. Theme analysis 

2. Keywords analysis 

3. Question analysis 

4. Options analysis 


The most basic way to brainstorm anything is ask questions, a lots of questions. That's what you have to do with PYQs.




**SET A: Find the entire paper on UPSC website (UPSC Prelims 2025)



##Question 1


1. Theme analysis 

What is investment? In which chapter of my basic book did I study investment? What is it's relation with other basic concepts of Economy like inflation, interest rate, savings? What is the role of government or private sector in increasing investment? Types of investments. Etc. - So many questions, it is a very broad topic, I should revise it from my standard book.


Has UPSC asked question on investments earlier? They must have as it is a very borad topic. - Find them.



2. Keywords analysis

Investment, Bonds, Stocks, Hedge Funds, Venture Capital: Read everything about these in your standard books. If not given, use ChatGPT to read basics or just underline/ highlight in the solutions.



3. Question analysis 

There is a word ""Alternative"" in it, so popular investments might not come under it. I hear Bonds and Stocks everyday in news, they are popular.

It has ""fund"" in it. Hedge Fund has the word Fund in it. Are Stocks and Bonds funds? What exactly is a fund?

These type of things should come into your mind.



4. Option analysis: In these type of questions, do probability analysis. I am coverting these options in simpler form


a) Either I or II or III or IV (4 possibilities)

b) Either I and II or I and III or I and IV or II and III or II and IV or III and IV (6 possibilities)

c) Either I and II and III or I and III and IV or II and III and IV (3 possibilities)

d) All I and II and III and IV (1 possibility)


If you have to blindly guess which option to choose, which will you choose - Option b), right?

When you have gone through the statements and still confused, you have eliminated some options, then choose the option with highest probability. Do not do this blindly without reading the statements. Do not trust people who says Only 2 is always correct, yes it has high chances but trust your knowledge first.




##Question 25



1. Theme analysis:

Continental Drift has been asked earlier in Prelims and Mains. Very important and very basic theme. Given in initial chapters of NCERT.



2. Keywords analysis:

Continental drift, Gold deposits of Ghana (see it's location in map, boundaries), Brazil, Gondwana system - Given in standard book



3. Question analysis:

Asking for evidence - basic straightforward, given in NCERT

Statement I and II looks they are taken directly from NCERT. (If you have read it multiple times you would know)

Statement III is also given but the number ""six"" is something even if given in ncert most of us might not remember. Examiner can very easily change this number.


4. Options Analysis:
Based on earlier patterns. If you know any statement is incorrect you can reach the answer directly. Simple elimination. However, sll statements might be correct as well.




##Question 50


1. Theme analysis: 

Related to Pollution remediation. Theme has been repeated earlier but not sure about the particular topic.

All of us have heard Activated carbon in TV (cosmetics, facewash ad) - use your everyday knowledge as well.



2. Keywords Analysis:

Activated Carbon and it's properties, its uses, what are Pollutants? What are heavy metals? What is adsorbing? Difference with absorbing?



3. Question Analysis:

Tone of the question is positive. It is highlighting positive uses of Activated Carbon.

Statement III is talking about possibility (""can be""). In science, everything is possible. Do not worry about the word ""easily"", we don't know what the definition of easy is. Most things are easy in science if you have enough funding.



4. Statements Analysis:

No option is saying that statement I is incorrect.

Option d) is obviously wrong - Statement II and III are very positive and possibility of them getting wrong is very low.

By the tone of the options it is either a) or b). Now UPSC is very weird in these questions. But that’s not your problem.




##Question 75:



1. Theme analysis:

Related to Advent of Europeans. Similar questions have been asked I think earlier - what kind of trade they did, what crops they introduced.



2. Keywords analysis:

Papaya, Pineapple, Guava - see where they are grown, what kind of environment they need. From where did they come to India. You don't need to cram these things because it might not be given in standard books. Just do your research and have some idea.

Read about other crops introduced by Europeans - tobacco, cashew, rubber, coffee, etc.

When did the Portuguese came, important people associated, their ports, factories, trade, etc - Spectrum revise.



3. Question Analysis:

Nothing out of ordinary. A direct question.



4. Options analysis: 

I am again converting these options in simpler form

a) I or II or III (3 possibilities)

b) I and II or I and III or II and III (3 possibilities)

c) I and II and III (1 possibility)

d) None (1 Possibility)

Now I know a and b have higher chances of being correct. I have no knowledge of the question. If my number of attempts goes low (less than 90) then I will take a risk and mark either a or b (it can get wrong). Otherwise I would skip this one.
Don't worry about the negatives ( Read my earlier post about it)




##Question 100



1. Theme analysis:

Sports question, it is rare. No one prepares for it. Still it was a big news when Gukesh did that, many people might have heard this.



2. Keywords analysis:

Chess. Keep an eye while reading the news. Don't start reading everything about it. There are 6-7 players right from India who are among the best. Read about Vishwanathan Anand a bit.



3. Question analysis:

Statement I talking about an Indian's achievement. It is a positive news. But names can he easily swapped. There are two names Ian and Nepo. Trap alert.

Statement II, no one would've heard this name. There is a name, there is citizenship both can be made incorrect easily. Trap alert.


4. Options analysis:

Nothing out of ordinary. All options have equal chances of being correct.

Background

My time has come, to write my inspirational post. First I failed my first attempt using Kaplan. I wasn’t as prepared as I should’ve been. When I left the testing center, I Just knew I did not pass and I went all the way to 150. The Next morning at 5 AM I checked the board of nursing and they had already posted approved retest.   I did good nursing school, but I wasn’t an A+ student. I also used Mark K.

The Study Process

I paid for two months of Boot Camp and I followed the calendar. Some days I would miss and I would have to make it my duty to catch up and some days I was right on time. I attempted to watch Dr. Sharon. I also prayed every single day and did my best to do right by God. I proceeded to do the questions on study mode and I bought a fresh notebook and for each question I would write the topic. (Ex. 1. Intussception) for the ones I got wrong. I wrote the right answer in a different color pen in sentence for that had to do with that topic. Sometimes I would look back at them and sometimes I wouldn’t but with me writing on them now I begin to understand the topic or what the question was asking. I completed the entire test bank and anything I got wrong. I tried to review, but I did not complete every question. Towards my last couple weeks I scheduled my exam and I did not know that I had to wait for another ATT therefore I ended up scheduling my exam a little bit later than what I intended. I went to Florida for a week in my boot Camp expired. But I still had uworld to brush up on my topics. I watched a few Dr. Sharon videos, but I cannot say I remembered what she talked about when it came to test day. I also used my Tolan, she helped me study certain topics and help break down certain topics that I did not understand, after I would tell her to ask me NCLEX style questions.

Exam day: 
I woke up and I put on a cute outfit and even did they get ready with me. I grabbed me a light coffee and oatmeal from Starbucks. Then I made my way to the exam. When I got in there, I wrote God is good and God has my back on the exam board and I use the same strategy I use with my notebook with every question. Some question tell me choosing between two and some I kind of just knew. The cases that weren’t hearted either you really had to critically think. With the select applies I only choose the ones I knew for sure. I took my time with every single question but when I got to question 92 it shut off. I knew I got the last question right and it was a select all apply. They also asked me two questions about medicines and I kinda had to critically think about that. 

After: 

I felt so much better than I did the first time I took the test when I left. So the feeling of doom is not always an indicated that you passed and that’s because I studied my content. I went and got something to eat, and I waited the next morning at 5 AM. I checked and instead of it saying approved retest it said processing. I believe that is a good indicator. I then searched through everything and check to see if my exam was marked green and it was. It was only until yesterday at 11 o’clock at night that they posted my license and I officially knew that I was a registered nurse!

My Advice: 

- First you need to pray if you believe in a higher power. 
- They say the test is about strategy, but it’s really just about critically thinking and it is indeed about CONTENT. They ask content based questions!!
- Mark k was cool, but I did go a different route the second time around and some things I remembered some things I didn’t from him. 
- Dr. Sharon was not the reason I passed , she’s cool, but I didn’t need her! 
- Dress up the day of your test so that you can feel good!
- Eat brain food before your exam. 
- And don’t rush through your study process take your time. The test is gonna always be there. The Boot Camp calendar was not overwhelming to me. It was actually very organized and kept me on track. 
- And be sure to make sure you pay for your ATT prior. 
- Know that whatever you ask God for you will receive!

It’s depletion.

1lvii92,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lvii92/reveal_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Reveal the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Nespresso ENV95S Worth It,"The Nespresso ENV95S quickly made itself at home in my kitchen, earning its keep one cup of coffee at a time. To say it’s just another coffee machine, though, feels like a disservice—it’s more like a lifestyle upgrade, especially if you’re as addicted to high-quality brews as I am. From the moment I unboxed this sleek silver device, it was clear that it wasn’t messing around. Minimalist yet polished, it boasts a metallic finish so elegant that even my notoriously picky design-obsessed roommate gave it a nod of approval. But as with everything in life (coffee included), there are both perks and quirks to explore. Buckle up for the caffeinated ride.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe doesn’t scream “look at me!”—it whispers sophistication. With its compact 14 x 8.6 x 10.4-inch dimensions, it fits snugly even into cramped countertops, which is exactly what my tiny kitchen demanded. The 37 fl. oz. removable side water tank is neatly tucked in, making access a breeze even in tight spaces. One of the highlights for me has been the adjustable drip tray. Whether I’m using a petite espresso cup or my bottomless travel mug (great on hectic mornings), this machine has room for all. It’s made of 35% recycled plastic, and while I wouldn’t necessarily call it groundbreaking, it’s a nice nod to sustainability that feels meaningful.

**Ease of Use and One-Touch Functionality**  
Operating the coffee machine couldn’t be easier. The single-button system makes it almost too simple, though I suppose we’re living in an age where pressing two buttons feels like a chore. The 30-second heat-up time is perfect for impatient people like me who stumble into the kitchen in a caffeine-deprived haze. Nespresso’s patented Centrifusion technology is where things get fancy. It reads the barcode on each capsule and automatically adjusts brewing settings. I admit I was skeptical of this feature, but after trying a half-dozen different pods—from mild coffees to robust espressos—it consistently nailed the flavor and strength.

[Check Nespresso ENV95S price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b0c3f2s53n/)

**Signature Coffee Experience**  
Where the daydreamy magic happens is in the brewing experience itself. This machine offers five cup sizes ranging from a quick espresso shot to a lazy Sunday’s 12oz coffee. What’s particularly intriguing is its ability to brew not just traditional hot coffee but cold brew-style coffee as well. I tested out both, and the iced coffee was surprisingly rich and nuanced, unlike the watered-down disappointment I’ve come to expect from homemade versions. The tasting pack included with the machine was a nice touch too. It introduced me to the breadth of their 40+ permanent and seasonal capsules, and let me tell you, their premium blends are a game-changer for any coffee lover.

**Advantages**  
- Compact, stylish design that fits in small spaces  
- Adjustable drip tray accommodates various cup sizes  
- Intuitive one-touch operation, perfect for busy mornings  
- High versatility with five different cup sizes and iced coffee options  

**Sustainability Features**  
It’s impossible to ignore the brand’s emphasis on the environment here. Yes, the machine itself is partially made from recycled materials, but the real highlight is their capsule recycling program. I’ll admit, a few years ago, I would have shrugged this off. But now, knowing that I can recycle the aluminum capsules with minimal fuss adds a guilt-free layer to my daily cup of coffee. That said, the downside is the ongoing cost of these pods, as they aren’t compatible with standard refillable ones.

**Limitations**  
- Not compatible with third-party pods, which locks you into Nespresso’s ecosystem  
- Capsule system can get pricy over time, especially for heavy coffee drinkers  
- The water tank, while adequate, might feel small if brewing multiple large servings  

**Product Rivals**  
As much as I’ve come to love this machine, it’s worth comparing it to alternatives. The Keurig K-Café comes to mind, offering similar one-touch convenience but with a focus on versatility, including a built-in frother. However, Keurig falls short on flavor depth when compared to Nespresso’s Centrifusion technology. Similarly, the classic Breville Barista Express specializes in hands-on espresso mastery. It’s a beast for serious coffee enthusiasts but not practical for everyday use unless you have barista aspirations. In a nutshell, the Nespresso lands somewhere in the middle—a modern, no-fuss solution for consistently great coffee.

**True Value**  
Is the Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe worth the investment? Let’s talk cost-effectiveness. While this coffee machine sits at a premium price point, its features deliver genuine value for money. The ease of use, customizable brewing options, high-quality blends, and aesthetic appeal make it worth considering if your mornings demand both style and substance. Sure, the proprietary capsule system could be seen as a drawback, but if you’re prioritizing convenience and taste, it’s hard to beat. Over time, investing in this machine would likely save you from spending a small fortune at coffee shops (speaking from experience here).

1lvihhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AYPYoga/comments/1lvihhd/ayp_yoga_lesson_232_meditation_and_automatic_yoga/,"AYP Yoga - Lesson 232 - Meditation and Automatic Yoga (a dialog), by Yogani","Q1: I recorded my experience today with the I AM meditation. I am just beginning so this is as far as I have gone. The experience was awesome, as they say. I am keeping a diary of what I experience. I have copied my experience and pasted it here. I wanted to find out if what I experienced is ""normal"". Thank you. 

2nd attempt at I AM. First time I did this was lying in bed. Did it for about 20 minutes and then went to sleep. Did not notice anything spectacular. Probably wasn't a good idea to do it in bed as it is too relaxing and I was sleepy when I did it. 

Had coffee, no food prior to beginning:

Next time, sat in my office chair with doors closed. Palms on thighs. After some time, felt as though I was about to float out of top of head but only very briefly. Felt like a floating sensation. This happened twice. 

Then after some more time, an overwhelming tingling sensation washed over my body and became stronger and stronger. I noticed my breathing change with it. It was intense like a wave similar to waves of ecstasy one has in approaching orgasm. It was definitely sexual in nature and ran throughout my entire body, not just one area. 

When it first started however it also resembled the feeling one gets when one experiences some excitement of the kind that gives one goose bumps and butterflies. Similar to what may be referred to as an adrenal rush but, but a good one. This tingly sensation of excitement soon led to the waves of ecstasy described above.

After several moments of this it was almost as though I could take no more, and then it backed off for some moments. Then a second wave came like the first. I actually made some verbal sound as a sigh or groan as it continued and my breathing became heavier and deeper. I noticed too I felt like I might be trembling but am not sure now whether my body was actually trembling or it just felt that way. 

After this second wave passed, for some reason I was ready, perhaps even anxious, to end the session but was aware that I was supposed to do this for a full twenty minutes. I looked at my clock and saw that I still had a little more than 5 minutes or so to go so resumed it. After some moments, again, the feeling started to come as described above but this time it was more jolting, not as smooth as the first two. I felt this jolt twice. After some moments I ended the session, having gone a total of about 20 minutes. I took several deep breaths and remained sitting and rested as advised and then wrote this so that I forgot nothing.

A1: Thank you for writing and sharing. 

You are off to a very good start, finding out right away the difference between meditating lying down and sitting up! Keep in mind that your experiences will vary over time, sometimes very deep, sometimes with lots of energy (even sexual - you will read more on that in later lessons), other times dull, and sometimes a bit restless. All experiences are correct as long as we favor the easy procedure of meditation. What is important is long term daily practice. That is what purifies and opens our nervous system. See lesson [\#180](https://www.aypsite.org/180.html) with a response to someone having strong start like you did. 

Our experiences during practices are mostly due to purification going on in our nervous system, and will vary greatly. Even ecstatic experiences are largely purification. It all comes out according to how the impressions of past actions are stacked inside. There is no accounting for it, and all we have to do is our procedure of practice, and purification and opening happens. So, don't become too attached to experiences that occur in meditation. Practice is good if we follow the procedure, no matter what happens experientially in our sitting. Of course we all love blissful and ecstatic experiences. Enjoy them when they happen. But keep in mind that experiences are symptoms, not the practice itself. We don't want to become distracted from our practice by experiences that come up. So when experiences come, we notice them, and go back to the practice we are doing. That is what keeps us going forward toward enlightenment. As you read through, you will encounter many lessons that discuss this from a variety of angles. 

Q2: Thank you. I am somewhat relieved to know that I don't necessarily have to expect to repeat that experience. Otherwise I may have thought I was doing something wrong if nothing happened next time. 

I just read lesson #39 & #41 on pranayama, which I have not yet tried. I did some deep breathing before starting my meditation on I AM that morning. Maybe that was one reason my experience was so dramatic. 

I am taking another course that gives the sound OOMM to chant. I haven't been doing it lately but thought I would start again. I saw one of the Q&As where you state the difference between ""I AM"" and ""OMM"", that latter being circular. But I am wondering if I should wait a while after the meditation to do my OMMM chanting. 

I have several questions: 

Can you tell me when I should start trying spinal breathing pranayama? That is, are there a certain number of days that one should do the I AM meditation before they do the pranayama exercise? Also is it advisable to set an egg timer so that I will know when my 20 minutes are up? Is it necessary to do it 2x per day to achieve optimum results? Do you state somewhere in the Q&A why the lotus position is better than sitting in a chair? 

I am really surprised at how powerful that mediation technique is. I still can't believe it. I had always wondered at the significance of the phrase I AM in the Bible. Now I am even more curious and want to go back through all the places where it is referenced. 

My husband is going to try it sitting up now. He too had only tried it lying down before so I am anxious to hear of his results. I didn't tell him about mine because I didn't want him to be expecting a certain result.

A2: Given that you have just started and have lots happening already, it would be wise to stabilize your meditation practice for at least a few weeks before adding pranayama. Then you will have a good platform from which to expand. As you read through the lessons you will see a lot on ""self-pacing,"" which is essential for success in yoga. You already have seen the first lesson on this (#38) called ""What is your time line?"" A very important subject - more important than any single practice. Without a skilled driver, the car is not likely to reach its destination. 

Self-pacing applies to taking on other practices outside AYP too, which is risky to begin with because the effects in combination with AYP practices can be unpredictable. You are in charge of your journey. Be measured in your approach, always stabilizing what you have before moving ahead. Each person is different. Stabilizing could take weeks or months. In some cases (as with mantra enhancements and advanced pranayama-kumbhaka methods given later in the lessons) it could take years. A few days will rarely do it. Even experts in yoga have to apply prudent self-pacing in practices to accommodate the many experiences that come up as the nervous system goes though stages of purification. So, satisfy your thirst for knowledge by reading on, but build your routine very gradually so you can remain consistent in your practices over the long term. That is how enlightenment happens. Rome was not built in a day.

It is okay to use an egg timer for meditation, but don't become too dependent on it. It is best to develop the inner clock for timing practices, with occasional peeking at the watch or clock as necessary. Once we have this ""inner clock"" skill, then using an egg timer is not our sole means of timing. That way, if you are without your egg timer, you won't be at a loss. 

Siddhasana (not lotus) is the way of sitting that the lessons evolve toward. You will see why as you read on. It is a simple and powerful practice for raising ecstatic energy. The cultivation of inner silence and ecstatic energy, and their natural union (inner lovemaking of ""shiva and shakti"" or ""father and holy spirit""), is the key to human spiritual transformation. 

On the twice a day, read lesson #148. Many of your questions you can find answers to in the [topic index](https://www.aypsite.org/TopicIndex.html) on the web site, or by using the site search feature. I will be happy to help with anything that you cannot find a satisfactory answer on.

The methods in the lessons are the simplest and most powerful I have encountered over more than three decades on the path, integrated together into a system of practices. So, yes, this is all very powerful stuff. Use good self-pacing, avoid tangents (lots of those will tempt you), and you can go very far with this over the long term. Enjoy! 

Q3: Thank you much again. Yesterday I again received the waves washing over me, up and down which felt as I can best describe, as an electrical current. I noticed my breathing began to change each time this occurred causing me to take deeper breaths, which I immediately corrected. I soon found that I could control the waves at will. Not sure if I should allow them or discourage them? 

I also noticed my head began both times to rock gently back and forth and then to eventually sway side to side in what seemed a figure 8. After the experience, I did a search under ""swaying"" and found where one of your students also experienced swaying but with his entire body. I read your responses about not letting all these sensations detract from the main purpose. 

For the first time today, I did my meditation in the lotus position with my back against my couch. It wasn't as comfortable and was a bit distracting a few times but I managed to keep directing my attention away from the discomfort and concentrate on the mediation. The electrical waves came again, but this time were a lot more subtle. And again when the breathing intensified I immediately stopped it and calmed it and stayed quiet. 

I did away with the egg timer and peeked at the clock again. I think I may have been a little more anxious to end the session because of the position I was in. When it was over, my lower leg was asleep. I didn't see any instruction on ""when"" we should start the lotus position. I did see lesson [\#33](https://www.aypsite.org/33.html). I will start doing some exercises to limber my joints up a bit which I remember from ballet school many a year ago. I still felt my mediation was good though it wasn't quite as smooth as in the sitting position. 

A3: You are having the classic symptoms of what I call ""automatic yoga,"" from just a few days of meditation. It goes without saying that you have come ""wired"" for this from past lives of work in yoga. We are all wired for it by virtue of our human nervous system. Some have more neural conductivity than others because they have done direct work on the circuitry before. You are one of those, and now you are picking up where you left off. We all have the same journey and destination - purification and opening of our nervous system to unending ecstatic bliss and outflowing divine love. 

By automatic yoga, I mean physical, mental and emotional tendencies coming up out of nowhere, seemingly unrelated to the practice we are doing. This happens because there is a connectedness of yoga throughout our nervous system. This is explained in more detail later in the lessons, particularly in discussing the ""eight limbs of yoga,"" first introduced in Lesson 149. For now, just know that your rising desire to study, practice, take on more, etc. is all coming from the few dives you have taken into pure bliss consciousness within. So too are the bending legs, breathing symptoms, and head movements from this. Pretty amazing, isn't it? The lessons will help you guide all of these tendencies step by step into a safe and effective routine of practices. 

When movements or deep breathing come up in meditation, we don't entertain them, or force them out. We just easily go back to the procedure of meditation, picking up the mantra at whatever level of refinement we left it, and let it continue to refine. 

Breathing generally becomes very quiet during meditation, as the metabolism slows way down. If it is getting deeper or is speeding up, that could be associated with ecstatic energies beginning to move. Don't dwell on that, as it will take your attention away from the simple process of meditation. When you begin spinal breathing (a separate practice done before meditation), then you will have the opportunity to cultivate the ecstatic energies in a progressive and balanced way. Favor the procedure for using the mantra during meditation over anything that comes up. The same goes for head movements and other symptoms that can occur - just easily let it go in favor of meditation. Much later in the lessons, you will see that head movements also will be part of practices in the form of an advanced method called ""chin pump."" That is way down the road though. You are just starting out. Take things one step at a time. Gently favor the practice you are doing, no matter what else comes up. If some of these things become so strong that they seem to be dominating your meditation time, then just be easy and let your attention be with the movements or sensations (without encouraging them) for a few minutes without picking up the mantra. That will help stabilize the energy flow. Then after a few minutes you can go back to meditation. 

On the folding legs, the lessons do not teach lotus (feet up on thighs). We use siddhasana instead, which is a more direct means for cultivating the ecstatic energies within. Once you get through spinal breathing, mulabandha, and sambhavi, you will come to siddhasana. You are doing right to be loosening up the legs now. No need to go up on the thighs with your feet though - just develop some comfort having the legs folded with toes tucked under a bit, as discussed in lesson [\#33](https://www.aypsite.org/33.html). This builds a foundation for things to come, with a minimum of distraction to meditation. If it becomes too distracting, ease off the folded legs. Try one folded until two works. Try legs folded only one sitting out of two each day. It is a gradual process of adjustment that can takes weeks or months to work into. In the meantime, keep as comfortable as possible while meditating. In time, sitting with legs folded will be completely natural and unnoticed during practices. So will siddhasana, except for the fountain of unending ecstasy coming up from it. Well, that is another subject. 

Timing for taking on new practices is discussed in the course of the lessons. It has to do with your ability to assimilate things more than anything. That is why specific times are not given. Everyone is different. The main thing is not to get too far ahead of yourself. Even that is not the end of the world in the short term, as long as you know to back off when you get a little too far ahead of your nervous system's ability to digest new practices. It is a process of always testing, stepping forward, and stepping back -gradually learning the ropes of this wonderful transformable spiritual vehicle we are living in - the human nervous system! 

Q4: I took a quick skim of the chin pump article (#139) and it seems that describes something very similar to what was happening to me.

This is getting quite exciting but I want to take it step by step as you suggested so I didn't read it in detail. There are so many articles that to do otherwise would be very difficult in any case. Yesterday for the first time, I did the meditation twice. My legs were just crossed. (I haven't even attempted the lotus position & am glad to hear we won't be expected to use it!) Again, sitting cross legged was very distracting but once I got into the meditation it became smoother. 

I am wondering about the meditation on ""I AM"". Over the past weeks before I found your yahoo group and website, I had been doing a mental affirmation throughout the day, ""I am in harmony with Christ"". I even have a pillow speaker under my pillow with me speaking that affirmation. The reason for this was that I had read in one of the books I am currently reading (reading Spalding on the Siddha Masters, Collier, Trine & Hill so I get them mixed up sometimes) and one them had said that one of the reasons for sickness, stress, etc. was being out of harmony with Christ. Also they all talk about us as being Divine, that God is within us. I suppose I grew up like a lot of people thinking about Him as being up there somewhere separate from us.

So sometimes in my meditation, while thinking I AM, I am thinking of God then I alternate with just meditating on the words ""I AM"" without thinking of God. So I suppose I'm uncertain as to how to think/feel when I think ""I AM"".

At one point, for just a few seconds last night in my second session, it seemed I stepped out and forward from the meditation on the words, into a circle with some colors and there were no words or thinking. It was just like a complete separation from thought and body. But it was just for seconds and then I was back thinking I AM. This occurred a couple of times very briefly. I wanted to explore it more but it didn't happen again. It was as though I was on the very edge of something but couldn't quite get there. Then during this morning's mediation, I felt that same separateness but this time rather than moving up into a circle I felt as though I were falling backwards and floating into that separateness. Again, all thought of thinking I AM and my body was forgotten. It was so 'still'. I wanted it to last longer again but it was only for a few seconds a couple of times. For the first time since beginning the meditation, I wasn't anxious to come out of it. I was content to stay there but went ahead and ended it at 20 minutes since that's what you have advised.

I do have a question that is confusing me even while I meditate:

Should I think of God as I meditate I AM or try just to meditate I AM without its meaning or thinking of God or my Divine nature? Should I try to divorce the meditation form thoughts of God?

I wanted to check about something new that happened last night. 

Yesterday and last night I noticed at times, my breathing was so slight, that once I thought I had stopped breathing. But the newest thing is last night, the area in my solar plexus was pressed inward to such a degree that it felt as though my entire rib cage was exposed with the area in the middle under the breastbone going inward. It must have actually been drawn inward towards my back for I could feel the movement under my breast. It wasn't painful, just really intense. I didn't think I was holding my breath and cannot remember now this morning exactly how my breathing was when this happened. I should have made notes right after this. So naturally again I am wondering about this and if you have ever heard of this happening?

A4: The mantra is used for sound only, not meaning. In the [topic index](https://www.aypsite.org/TopicIndex.html) you can find several lessons on this under ""mantra - language and meaning."" Another way to spell the ""I AM"" mantra is ""AYAM."" Same pronunciation. None of this takes away from the meaning and mystique of the Christian phrase, ""I AM."" It is just that when we use it as a mantra, it is the vibration that matters, not the English meaning. My background is Christian also.

So, when thoughts come up in meditation regarding the meaning of I AM, or God, or whatever, we just treat them like any other thoughts that come up and easily go back to the mantra. The same is true for all experiences we have in meditation, no matter how ecstatic, profound, revelatory, strange, or dramatic - when we realize we are off into something, no matter what, we just easily go back to the mantra. That is the procedure of meditation.

Ah, you noticed the breathing slowing down and nearly stopping. As   
mentioned before, that is normal.

The diaphragm pulling in and up is another of those automatic yogas. It is called ""uddiyana."" You can find discussions on it in the practices section (top) of the [topic index](https://www.aypsite.org/TopicIndex.html), under ""uddiyana/nauli.""

Take it step-by-step, and enjoy!

Q5: So in other countries, in other languages they also use ""I AM"" rather than their translation of ""I AM""?

I just did a quick read of the article you referred to on uddiyana. This is so incredible that my body is doing all of these things on its own. Though I hadn't mentioned it, my tongue has also been cupping and pressing against the roof of my mouth near the front. I didn't realize it was something that you consciously try to do. I guess whatever my body starts to do from here on, I can safely assume it knows better than I.

I am trying to follow everything step by step. By my body jumping into all of these things on its own, am I at risk in not developing properly since I seem to be doing things out of order? I only start out by thinking to do only the mediation. These things are just happening on their own. I've had some other things happen as well that I may later learn are automatic yoga. 

A5: Yes, since we are using the sound of I AM (AYAM) and not the meaning, translation of meaning into other languages is not advised. The sound has a universal vibratory resonance in the human nervous system. That's why I call it a universal mantra. 

Ah, the tongue has gone up? That is called ""kechari,"" a very important one we talk about a lot in the later lessons. You can look it up in the [topic index](https://www.aypsite.org/TopicIndex.html).

With all this coming up, I can see that you are a little concerned about how to manage it going forward. I suggest you don't even try. Just do your practices according to plan, taking on new ones gradually over the coming months and years, with the priority being to establish stable practice each step along the way. Whatever comes up as automatic yoga, regard with equanimity, and stay the course with structured daily practice over the long term. If you do that, then all these things will fit together naturally in due course.

Given your fast moving situation, the most important things I recommend you keep in mind are patience and self-pacing in practices. If you try and accommodate all that is going on at the same time, it will be very difficult. You have many gifts of yoga sprouting there. Tend your garden with care, day by day, and you will travel far. 

Always remember that the most important practice is deep meditation. This is what cultivates our foundation of inner silence underneath all of the external hub-bub. Without it we will be flailing about in the wind, with no center, no matter how much automatic yoga we have going on. Inner silence (pure bliss consciousness) is the key to all progress in yoga. 

As it says in the psalms, ""Be still, and know I am God."" 

Q6: Thank you for your answer to my many questions. I was a little concerned about how to manage these things but that has now been put to rest by your answer. I will proceed methodically as though these things weren't happening.

Yesterday, I only did the meditation (with spinal breathing) once rather than twice. I had been for several days, experiencing a difficulty in putting my mind/energy on the more mundane tasks that my work requires. I had no motivation to do my work and thought that it might be a result of the mediation. I remember that you have stated that it is advisable to rest after the meditation and I never really did that beyond a minute or two at most so perhaps that is what I needed to do. 

But I decided yesterday to try doing without the morning session and only did the evening session. I looked in your Q&A for any info on whether you are to do it everyday, 7 days a week or if it's desirable to perhaps occasionally skip a day or one of the two sessions once in a while at least at the beginning. It may be there in the postings but I didn't find anything that addressed this question.

One other thing I wanted to ask about: I had written after my second or third mediation that I had found I could control the waves of energy charge that pulsed through my body at will. It started off happening without conscious effort but then I found I could make it happen again with minor effort. But lately, the last couple of days, I have been experiencing this in my daily routine out of mediation as well. At times during the day or night I feel the urge to push this energy current through my body at will. It might be while making a protein shake or working at my computer or while watching the news. It's becoming somewhat addictive I think. It's happening at least once about every hour. If I don't do it willingly, then it comes on its own. I don't feel it's a bad thing. It feels rather pleasant and gives me an unexplainable feeling of empowerment. Is this an enhancement of my spiritual powers or merely a part of the purification process?

A6: Yes, taking it easy, and one day at a time, is the best approach. It is the best approach whenever big changes come into our life - our system is opening us up to become infinite pure bliss consciousness encompassing the entire universe! 

Yes, the experiences are part of purification and will change - expand actually, so there is much more to come. And yes, it can be addictive. That is in the very first lesson - my addiction to yoga and the experiences it brings. To borrow a word from the 12 step program for addicts, maybe we are all ""recovering"" yogis and yoginis. Recovering what is ours that has been long lost, that is. It is not primarily about the ecstatic experience of the moment. It is about something infinitely bigger than the greatest ecstatic pleasure we can have today. Enjoy your experiences, and incorporate them into your everyday life. The best way to do that is by taking your bliss and sharing it with others in simple ways. Simple living for the benefit of others is the best way I know to keep rising ecstatic experiences from going to our heads. That's part of why I am writing these lessons. What good is rising enlightenment if it is unshared? Not much good at all. Down-right self-indulgent. The truth is, enlightenment can't happen fully until it is shared in service for the benefit of others, because enlightenment is, by nature, all-encompassing. 

It is not our fault that the true nature of life is ecstatic bliss. The human nervous system is an ecstasy machine. Should we run from that? I don't think so. As we move into our natural state of ecstasy, we can do so with responsibility. That is how we can make the journey. Ecstatic bliss must flow outward to the world to find its fruition, and so too must we. To do anything less is a form of spiritual hedonism. We may do that for a while, just indulge inwardly in our ecstatic experiences. That's okay. Sooner or later we will go out into the world with our ecstatic bliss. It is inevitable. Along the way in yoga, we unravel one of the greatest of all mysteries through our direct experience - the role of sexuality in human spiritual transformation. 

As for daily practices, it is better to stick with two sessions every day, because developing and maintaining the habit is so very important. This was covered in a lesson not long ago ([\#209](https://www.aypsite.org/209.html)) called, ""Fitting daily practices into a busy schedule."" I know that lack of time is not the reason you have tried cutting back to one session, but that lesson gets into the reasons why keeping the twice daily habit is so important. So does lesson #148, ""Why practices twice a day?"" 

If you are feeling a bit over-stimulated in your practices, then the thing to do is cut back on time in the twice daily sittings. If you are doing 5 minutes spinal breathing and 20 minutes meditation, and are having too much happening, then, rather than doing it once a day, try cutting breathing back to a few minutes and meditation to 15 minutes twice a day. If that is still too much, then try meditation at 10 minutes. It can be ramped back up later as your nervous system adjusts to the energies. This is the all-important topic of ""self-pacing"" which is discussed extensively in the lessons. The key is to find a balanced and stable twice daily routine. That way, we can cultivate inner silence and ecstatic energies in our nervous system and stabilize them in activity using a twice daily cycle, which is much more effective than doing a once daily cycle with longer practice. Of course, there will be times that we are too pressed for time or too exhausted to do much of anything at practice time. Then we just keep the habit by sitting for a minute or two with eyes closed. See how that works? It is about the twice daily habit. As they say, ""use it or lose it."" We can be flexible with our times and practices within that twice daily commitment, as necessary. 

Q7: I had a session yesterday that was, well all I could think afterwards was WOW! I had had two days of quieter mediation with the usual 'automatic' head rocking and circling but the experience was much milder and quieter without all the involuntary surges of energy as before and no new automatic yoga experiences.

So I decided to move on and incorporate lessons #41, #54 & #55 (on spinal breathing, kundalini, and mulabandha) in my session yesterday. The experience was the most powerful I have had yet and there were a lot of new things, what you call ""automatic yoga"" going on I think. 

A7: As you add on new practices, keep in mind that there can be a delayed reaction in effects. So we don't really know all of what a new practice is doing for a few weeks at least. If you have piled on two or three new practices, and things take off, it may be hard to figure out what is doing what - and that's when self-pacing gets tricky - what to back off on when the energy is flying everywhere? Getting a bit ahead of yourself is not the end of the world, as long as you know to back off when necessary for a smoother ride. You'll get the hang of it. 

Just remember you have a spiritual Ferrari there (an extra fast one) and you have to learn how to drive the thing without running off the road. You are in the driver's seat. 

All the best on your journey. Vrrrooom!

After reading many reviews I like one boat run by [Komodo Luxury](https://www.komodoluxury.com/) because the ship is big, has two engines, life rafts, and vests in every room, which makes me feel safe.

The plan they sent is three days and two nights. Day-1 they pick me up at Labuan Bajo airport, sail to Padar Island for a short but steep hike, then stop at Pink Beach to swim and watch sunset. We sleep near Manta Point. Day-2 starts early with a guided walk on Rinca to see the dragons, then snorkel where mantas feed. Last day we swim at Kanawa Reef before they drop me back at the port and drive me to the airport by late afternoon.

Cabins have their own shower, AC, and clean sheets. They said they can cook veggie meals if I ask, and there is coffee and water all day. The cost is high for my budget, but it covers all food, gear, and park fees, so it might still be ok.

If you have done this route solo, did you feel safe at night on the boat? Was the sea rough in July? Should I bring strong sea-sick pills or are the waters calm then?

1lvifof,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1lvifof/advice_for_newly_diagnosed/,Advice for newly diagnosed,"Hi all! This my first time posting on a subreddit but I feel like I need a community with this.

I had the flu real bad in February and a week later I started having fainting episodes. After like 3 months of ignoring it (lol oops) I went to my neurologist (who I had for a separate issue) and was like “bitch is this weird or what?” And she was like “weird and what.” 

So I was strapped to a table and poked and prodded for 30 minutes before we got to the tilt table test. Which I’ve for one heard mixed reviews about it being barbaric or something but I was like whateva I’ll be fine. 

The nice lady and I are laughing and then im not at 45 degrees. My body didn’t find it very funny. It was like someone screamed Andy’s Coming and dying was the best option. 

-45 degrees later im back and shaking like a chihuahua asked to public speak and the lovely nurse was like “oh shit that doesn’t usually happen.” So she goes to get her attending and suddenly I’m a spectacle. They’re like “ok well you might have to do that again bc bitch you only lasted like 2 seconds and it’s supposed to be 10 mins.” So I said “strap me in I ain’t no bitch.” I was a bitch. The other nurse caught my head bc I folded. 

Anywho that was a Monday. Thursday I’m at work and I feel like my head about to hit the wall (boum). So I lay on the floor, put my feet up. Which doesn’t alarm my coworkers bc this is the norm for me regardless to just lay on the floor. But I guess at some point someone noticed me shaking violently and was like “oh slime, you not so good?” Then they started talking to me about vegetables I guess to keep me conscious but my body was not interested so I zonked out. I come back and lifted up and I’m out again. Then paramedics arrive and they weren’t hot which was a bummer but I digress. 

Any way six days later I’m being discharged from the cardiac unit of the hospital I was at where I got most of every test under the sun with the final diagnosis of “dizziness” and my drivers licenses revoked. But an under the table diagnosis of POTS. I guess they didn’t want that on their records or something. 

Any who long story short I’ve scheduled a doctors appointment March of next year for the only POTS specialist in the freaking area. I’m on a waitlist for a club I never asked to be in. I’m slowly figuring out my triggers one bad day at a time bc when I asked my doctor what I’m supposed to be doing she GENUINELY shrugged and was like, “beats me.” I quoted that from her.
So coffee is a no go. Hot days, humidity, long walks, too much food, too little food— are my known triggers. Those silly compression stuff doesn’t really help me much and I hate the socks I’d rather smack my head into the concrete. 

Any advice? Anything you can tell me to buy? I’m an easy target if you tell me it works I’ll buy it. Today I’m trying matcha but I’m already shaking and hot and my head is swimming while I’m sitting on the toilet writing this so sorry for the loss of brain cells to you.

1lvicpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1lvicpf/the_town_that_skipped_tuesdays/,The town that skipped Tuesdays,"Nobody in Whistlebridge could explain what happened on that strange April morning—but one thing was clear:

Tuesday was missing.

People woke up thinking it was Tuesday. Coffee was made, ties were tied, children were stuffed into itchy uniforms. But as everyone looked at their phones and calendars, they were stunned.

It said Wednesday.

""Must be a glitch,"" muttered Mayor Hargrove as he poured cream into his cereal instead of milk, distracted by the phantom date.

But the glitch wasn’t just in the tech. It was everywhere.

— The bakery was missing an entire shelf of croissants. — The church bell, which rings every Tuesday at noon, had rust on it. — And worst of all, old Mr. Pennington's cat—who was only ever seen on Tuesdays—was gone.

Dr. Lavinia Bloom Investigates

The town’s self-declared “Occasional Scientist” and part-time florist, Dr. Lavinia Bloom, took immediate action. She marched to the mayor’s office in a lab coat embroidered with violets and said, “This is temporal theft.”

“Temporal what now?” asked the mayor, halfway through a lukewarm muffin.

“Time has been stolen,” she said, snapping on rubber gloves. “This is the work of Chrono-Thieves.”

Mayor Hargrove blinked. “Is that... a real thing?”

Dr. Bloom nodded gravely. “They slip between the seams of seconds. They siphon days, hours, whole weeks. They sell them on the black market to billionaires who want longer weekends.”

“You expect me to believe someone stole Tuesday and sold it to Jeff Bezos?”

“No,” she said. “He already has a dozen Tuesdays. This one probably went to someone more desperate… like Elon Musk’s third clone. The one they don’t talk about.”

The mayor fainted. It was a soft, dignified faint.

Operation: Recover Tuesday

Dr. Bloom assembled a ragtag team:
— A retired magician named Cardigan Jack.
— A talking parrot that only said “That’s suspicious.”
— And a child genius who built a time-sniffing drone from an old leaf blower and a toaster.

They called the drone “Nostalgatron.”

It buzzed through the town square, following faint traces of yesterday. It sniffed the air, whirred, beeped, and zoomed straight into the local laundromat, where—behind the dryers—they found a glowing blue portal.

“Classic,” muttered Cardigan Jack. “Time bandits love laundromats.”

Through the portal they stepped, emerging into a realm made entirely of lost time. There were floating clocks, undone Mondays, half-baked holidays, and a suspicious number of New Year’s Resolutions.

They found Tuesday lounging on a hammock made of broken plans.

“I’m not going back,” Tuesday said. “People complain about me. Nobody likes me. Monday gets the hate, but I’m just… forgotten.”

Dr. Bloom stepped forward. “You matter, Tuesday. Without you, people are disoriented. Meetings were missed. Leftovers went uneaten. The town accountant wore pajamas to work.”

Tuesday blinked. “Wait, really?”

“Yes,” she said gently. “We need you. Even if you’re the second-most boring day of the week.”

Moved by her words (and flattered to be second), Tuesday agreed to return.

Restoring the Day

The team carried Tuesday back through the portal. As the sun rose, time snapped into place. The calendar corrected. The cat reappeared. Croissants returned, warm and flaky. The bell rang at noon. People felt oddly… refreshed.

No one spoke about the missing day again. They just went on, a little more grateful, a little more aware.

But sometimes, when someone says, “Where did the time go?”
A strange breeze blows through Whistlebridge.
And somewhere, Tuesday smiles.

My social networking app for Android is in dire need of 12 testers for 14 days.

No technical knowledge needed, just someone that downloads the app on their Android, plays with it a little bit, and gives me feedback - is there any bug? Is the app intuitive? Is screen X cluttered? Etc.

I'll do the same for your app in exchange - or buy you a 🍺 or a ☕!

DM me or join the group here if interested: [https://groups.google.com/g/summn-testers](https://groups.google.com/g/summn-testers)

(I'll send you a GPlay link for the download.)

# What this app is about

SUMMN is a social networking app with focus on spontaneous events. Available only on Android for now.

Folks can browse events and activities or create their own according to a number of interests (""tags"").

Some use cases are:

* ⚽ I need a soccer teammate for tonight's game
* 🎭 Going to watch the opera in the afternoon, but my buddy is sick. Looking for a last-minute replacement now
* 🏝️ I'd love a a helping hand with my beach cleanup session tomorrow morning
* ✈️ I want to travel this summer, but I've got nobody to go with. I'm open to connect with new cool travel companions - let's have a chat about our dream destinations over tea or wine

The app allows anonymous browsing, but for event creation you need an account (free).

The app has a limited but fully-functional free tier. For the ultimate experience, a paid Premium sub is available (still in test mode).

# Why I developed it

Mainly because I wanted to expand my amateur volleyball team. Didn't take a degree in theoretical physics to see that it could be applied to other endeavours.

And I think people (especially Gen Z) are starving for purposeful connections - that's what I wanted to tackle as a general issue.

I'm fully aware there are many social networking apps on the market. I just wanted to solve the problem in my own way.

# What I need now

Big G asks for 12 testers for 14 days. I created a Google Group for this purpose: [https://groups.google.com/g/summn-testers](https://groups.google.com/g/summn-testers)

I'd just need someone that downloads the app on their Android, plays with it for a few days, and gives me general user feedback - are there bugs? Is the app intuitive? Does the copy make sense? Things like that.

I'm willing to do the same for your app in return, or buy you a beer or a coffee! Just tell me what you need.

Just DM me or join the group at [https://groups.google.com/g/summn-testers](https://groups.google.com/g/summn-testers) if interested.

Thanks for your help! 🙏

I thought it was a joke. Like, cool dad, did a goose steal your prom date or something?

He’d tell stories like, *“One stared me down in a Wendy’s parking lot in ‘94. I backed away slowly. It honked once. I never went back.”*

Every holiday he'd say grace and then somehow work in, “And Lord, protect us from goose-related incidents.” We thought it was his bit.

Until last week.

So, I’m at this local park on a casual walk, sipping an iced coffee and living my best non-goose-fearing life. I pass a small pond, and there he is. The final boss. Big. White. Beady eyes. Wings slightly raised like he just saw someone texting his girlfriend.

I try to keep walking, but he steps *into* the path. I move left, he moves left. I move right, same. At this point, I’m facing off with an angry sack of feathers like I owe him rent.

I decide to assert dominance (mistake #1). I *clap* at him. He hisses like Satan’s cat and takes flight, **at me.**

Now I'm sprinting, coffee flying, screaming things like “NOT TODAY, SATAN BIRD” while this hellbeast flaps behind me like a flying rage pillow. A child pointed and laughed. A goose was chasing a grown man in Crocs. I was the drama.

I finally dove into a bush. Not gracefully. I had leaves in places no leaves should be. The goose honked one last time, stared into my soul, and waddled off like *he* had errands to run.

I laid there, scratched, shaken, emotionally humbled.

Called my dad later. Told him everything.

All he said was: *“Told you. Never trust a goose.”*

1lvi95w,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1lvi95w/people_on_anxiety_medication_what_do_you_take_for/,People on anxiety medication - What do you take for energy?,"My CFS fluctuates pretty wildly and within the day. I may feel pretty normal (for my standards) and then get hit with a wave of fatigue and lethargy. I'm on medication for anxiety, so trying to balance taking stuff for anxiety and energy is... Exhausting. Generally speaking, anything I take for energy gives me or worsens anxiety; anything I take for anxiety gives me or worsens fatigue.


Caffeine is the obvious answer for many normal people. For me? Anxiety. Even if I feel good for a couple of hours (it's like playing Russian roulette) it ultimately makes me crash even harder and makes me depressed and lethargic. And I'm talking about pretty low doses like 50mg-75mg. I'd love to be able to drink coffee (~100mg) or have a Red Bull. Pretty sure I'd die.


I've tried CoQ10 - both versions. Ubiquinone just gives me straight up anxiety. Ubiquinol really doesn't seem to, but it's damn expensive and it gave me energy for a few days and then fizzled out. My Naturopath suggested taking I think like 300mg-400mg/day and id need to take out a second mortgage to afford that.


D-Ribose I tried in the past and I feel like it helped. I got the idea from ""From Fatigued to Fantastic."" But then I read that it can cause issues long term by increasing the risk of Alzheimers disease. 


I was low on B12 for awhile and it caused me a ton of symptoms. I have genetic mutations and methylated vitamins give me insane anxiety. Methylcobalamin I tried my hardest to tolerate but my anxiety was insane. Injections or sublingual. Hydroxocobalamin and Adenosylcobalamin, even at low doses, made my dissociation worse. I'm on like DROPS of cyanocobalamin and I don't think it helps my energy. But if I take too much I get anxious and fatigued. Just trying to avoid neurological issues.


Been dabbling with iron due to low ferritin. Got it up a bit and am working with my Hematologist on it. This is due to being on testosterone for naturally low T. But then taking iron and taking testosterone both increase red blood cells production and then they take blood to lower it which further crashes iron and ferritin. 


I take electrolytes. Dr. Berg brand (I know people here hate him). I just like it's simplicity and natural sweetener.


I've tried ADHD meds, both stimulant (immediate and extended release) and nonstimulant. Anxiety up the wazoo for stimulants and the nonstimulants don't help and give me side effects. 


As for sleep, I could probably do a better job. I get 7-8 hours. I use a CPAP machine religiously. To help fall asleep I'll take 100mg-200mg Magnesium Citrate (glycine gives me anxiety, go figure) and .25 Melatonin (yes, .25mg, not 2.5mg). Maybe I need to take the Melatonin earlier...",1,1752066227.0,cfs,0,1.0,False

Are you toiling with Mathematics and finding it formidable to keep up with the material? Keep your worries at bay! Because online math tutoring is here to save the day! With merely an internet connection, you can acquire personalized lookouts and direction from a comprehensive range of competent tutors who are keen to assist you. This blog strives to deliver you a quick outline of online math tutoring and exemplify why it's becoming an increasingly prevalent preference for students. Regardless of whether you're in elementary school or preparing for an academy exam, live math help can aid you to gain conviction and attain your educational pursuits. So, let's dive in and analyze how this ingenious solution can benefit you.

# Personalized Attention

One of the most pleasing [advantages of online math tutoring](https://www.vnaya.com/online-math-tutors) is the personalized attention students obtain from their tutors. In a classroom environment, educators usually have to split their attention among numerous students, leaving some students feeling left behind. With online tutoring, students can work one-on-one with their tutor, who can tailor the classes to the student’s precise requirements and learning style. This personalized attention can direct more rapid headway and boost confidence in mathematics skills.

# Adaptable Scheduling

Online tutoring even furnishes a tier of flexibility that standard tutoring does not. With online tutoring, students can plan sessions around their dynamic schedules, which is specifically valuable for students who have extracurricular activities or part-time jobs. Further, students can frequently book sessions on short notice if they require extra help before a test or project deadline.

# Convenient Learning Environment

It correspondingly delivers a suitable learning environment. Students can learn anywhere with an internet connection, whether it’s from the convenience of their own homes, at a coffee shop, or while on holiday. This eradicates the requirement for travel time and can make it more straightforward for students to fit tutoring sessions into their occupied schedules.

# Access to a Broad Range of Tutors

With online math tutoring, students have access to a broader range of tutors than they would with standard tutoring. Students can pick from tutors who specialize in a specific math subject, such as algebra or trigonometry, and can work with tutors globally. This variety of options assures that students can discover a tutor who matches their precise needs and education style.

# Use of Technology 

Live online tutoring also makes use of tech to [enrich the learning experience](https://www.vnaya.com/blog/Simple-Math-Learning-Tips-For-Kids-At-Home). Tutors can utilize interactive whiteboards, video conferencing, and different digital tools to make assignments more interesting and interactive. This technology can assist students to visualize math concepts better and make learning more satisfying.

# Cost-effective

Ultimately, online math tutoring can be a cost-effective option to conventional tutoring. Online tutoring firms frequently offer lower rates than in-person tutoring, and students can save funds on conveyance costs. Further, online tutoring firms may offer package deals or discounts for numerous sessions, making it more reasonable for students to receive frequent tutoring.

[Live online tutoring](https://www.vnaya.com/online-tutoring) has multiple advantages that make it an ideal option for students who desire to enhance their math skills. From personalized attention and adaptable scheduling to a broad range of tutors and cost-effectiveness, online math tutoring offers a fortunate and practical way to grasp math concepts. By taking advantage of technology and operating with a tutor who can tailor classes to your precise needs and learning style, you can construct the skills and enthusiasm you require to thrive in math and beyond. So, whether you're facing difficulty with algebra, geometry, calculus, or another mathematics topic, consider live math help as a worthwhile resource to help you achieve your visionary objectives.

As someone who starts each morning with caffeine, I find this single-cup coffee maker to be a unique mix of utility and accessibility. Delivering a streamlined experience tailored to grounds and K-pods, this product impressed me with its practicality but also offered a few surprises worth noting.

**Compact and Convenient Look**  
This petite machine sits easily on my crowded kitchen counter. Its dimensions (7.85""D x 4.33""W x 9.45""H) make it compact enough for cramped kitchens, offices, dorm rooms, or even RVs. It’s the perfect coffee brewing companion for limited spaces. The matte and metallic finish on the exterior adds a subtle sleekness, complementing various interior designs. What stood out to me was its lightweight construction, weighing in at only 2.2 pounds, making it remarkably portable. I even threw it in the backseat for a road trip, and it handled the journey unscathed.

**Winning Points**  
- Offers two brewing options for versatility: supports K-pods and ground coffee.  
- Compact and lightweight for small spaces and portability.  
- BPA-free and heat-resistant materials ensure safety and durability.  
- Built-in water tank allows easy monitoring of water levels.  

[Check Horavie KC201 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0drg5sdkf/)  

**Brewing Speed and Ease of Use**  
This machine is a lifesaver on busy mornings. With one-touch operation, I could brew my coffee in just 120 seconds—practically unheard of compared to some larger models. Whether it was a K-pod or freshly ground coffee, making a cup was as straightforward as adding water, inserting the coffee, and pushing a button. I appreciated that the reusable filter and K-pod holder prevented me from going over budget with unnecessary purchases. Plus, the descaling reminder was like having a personal assistant nudging me to clean the unit. A long press of just two seconds set the self-cleaning process into action—effortless!  

**Water Level Visibility and Safety**  
Sometimes, coffee makers can leave you blind to their water levels, but not this one. The built-in water tank boasts a view window, clearly displaying how much water remains. It prevented me from accidentally overfilling the machine on groggy mornings. Interestingly, though, the descaling operation required a little more focus. You’ve got to ensure the coffee filter or pod holder is empty during the process, which I forgot to do the first time. Small oversight, but worth keeping in mind.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Plastic components feel slightly less robust compared to premium competitors.  
- Brewing capacity is limited to one cup at a time, potentially inconvenient when entertaining guests.  
- No adjustability for coffee strength besides varying the amount of water or coffee.  

**Performance in Tight Comparisons**  
Compared to other competitors like the Keurig K-Mini and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the Horavie coffee maker stands out primarily for its descaling reminder and automated self-cleaning features. These aren’t commonly found in models priced similarly. While both Keurig and Hamilton Beach may offer a broader range of brew sizes or customization options, the Horavie KC201’s speed and portability still give it a unique edge. However, if brewing multiple cups quickly is a priority, you might prefer the competition since this machine sticks to a single-cup operation.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Is this coffee maker worth your investment? For its compact size, fast brewing time, and two brewing options, I’d say it delivers on its promises. While some premium models might boast advanced settings, this offers a balanced trade-off between cost and practicality. It’s especially ideal for solo coffee drinkers or those focusing on space-saving solutions. Even with minor points of concern, its performance-to-price ratio justifies its place in the market.

The cuff suggests it's been rotting for potentially months let alone years and it's on the upper layer of grass which might mean somebody chucked it there and then left. I'm not going down there again to poke it with a stick to see if it's just rubbish or not and going to file a report. I'm probably just creeped out by a rotted boot but this seems seriously wrong and out of place especially being right across from the upper end of the boardwalk across from the dogpark behind Hellyer College.

It's been raining like crazy since I took the photos so I'm not even sure if it's in the exact same spot, has washed away, or if it's disappeared again, but the opening of that boot's cuff has a concerning hue and textures that make it look like it's been decomposing for ages, most likely buried at some point and uncovered because over 95% of the sole tread is gone after I zoomed in on the photos to have a better look at what might actually be in the boot. I've been researching for hours trying to find some form of connection to a missing persons report or toddler homicide but literally nothing is coming up to suggest how that boot got there or where it came from. It also appears there might be some tattered fabric still attached to the boot (left side of photo). In a way it also appears halfway up the cuff of the boot it's as if it's ""expanded"" or bloated?

Nothing fancy. But we’re doing what we can, bit by bit. Scrubbing walls, repainting, trying to make it feel like ours. We’re not rich. We’re not perfect. But we’re trying. And then comes her. My husband’s older sister. The queen of “I’m just being honest.” She drops by uninvited every other week, sometimes with coffee, sometimes with nothing except her opinions. And when I say drops by, I mean walks in, looks around, and immediately goes “Still haven’t changed that couch?” “You know plants would make this place look less sad. Ugh, I couldn’t live with floors like this.” Every. Single. Time. She doesn’t even stay long. Just swoops in, throws some judgments around like confetti, then leaves. Like she did her good deed for the day by telling us how awful everything looks. I try to stay calm. I smile. I bite my tongue. I even cleaned extra hard before her last visit thinking maybe this time she’ll say something nice. Nope. She walked in, looked around, and said, “It still feels kinda... depressing in here.” That was it. That broke me. 

I told her flat out “If you don’t like how our house looks, then maybe stop showing up just to insult it.” I didn’t scream. I didn’t curse. I just said it. Straight. Cold. She acted shocked. Like I slapped her or something. Said I was being rude, ungrateful, defensive. Now she’s telling everyone in the family that I disrespected her in our home. She’s making it sound like I attacked her for no reason. My husband’s… weirdly quiet about it. Says she “means well” and I maybe “could’ve said it nicer.” But I don’t know. How many times does someone have to insult your space before you're allowed to speak up? I feel guilty for how I said it. But I’m also so damn tired of her making me feel like trash in my own home.

It’s almost 9pm.

Then while I was working at home,
my phone would ring. I’d rush to wear my headphones, answering with an excited voice.

You’d greet me with, “I’m sooo late.” And I’d laugh because you always were.

You’d tell me what took you so long, how you didn’t want to go, how everything felt heavy. Then you’d swing by the drive-thru, ordering dinner and coffee (and a happy meal too.)

“In a bit, wait lang ha, order lang ako.”
I’d wait quietly, maybe hum a little tune, while on the other line, I’d hear your soft voice politely talking to the crew.

Then I would hear you rummaging through your paper bag and munching on fries.

You’d talk like you had all the time in the world telling me stories, throwing jokes that made me laugh, grumbling about traffic, then breaking into a random song with that voice I loved.

Until suddenly, an automated voice would echo from the carpark. I’d say, “What? Nasa office kana. Ambilis ah” And you’d reply, “Yeap, nasa parking na ako.”

But you never rushed. You’d stay a little longer, finishing your food, chatting like you weren’t already late.

Then, pings from messages and emails, work tugging at your sleeve. I’d ask, “Awww, bye bye na?” You’d chuckle and say, “Hey, check your phone. How long have we been talking?”

I’d resist, “Ayokooo hahaha.”

I’d hear you shuffle, checking your things, deciding which jacket to wear. Then the soft mist of perfume. And finally, you’d say,
“It’s time for me to go. Talk to you later.”

And I’d reply in my sweetest, saddest voice,
“Okayyy… take care.”

It seems like the Bay Area would be a natural place for something like this to emerge, so I'm wondering if I've just missed finding the right communities. Just looking for casual coffee chats to discuss techniques, share experiences, maybe troubleshoot challenges together.

1lvhv4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/gastricsleeve/comments/1lvhv4d/surgery_scaries_hopes_and_fears/,"Surgery Scaries, Hopes and Fears","I'm gonna have surgery next week! As soon as I got my date somehow my brain still immediately went into ""OH GOD, DON'T DO IT"" mode so here are some of the things I'm excited about because of the surgery and for after the surgery! I've been flipflopping between fear and excitement for over a week and the carb-withdrawal certainly dosen't help.

For full transparency, I don't have any weight-releated health issues at this stage. If I had, they would definitely top the list.

* Less sweating. I'm so embarrassed all the time (even in WINTER) about how much I sweat at the slightest movement. On my face, yes but particularly the back and crotch sweat is mortifying.
* Being hot all the time. Related to sweating, I'm constantly hot. My hands and feet especially. So much so that sometimes I'll have to make them wet and turn a fan on them to just get some relief. My doctor told me chances are that after weightloss I'm more likely to constantly freezing than hot which is probably another issue entirely but still! No more hot hands please!
* Better sleep. I'm not officially diagnosed with sleep apnea but I have noticed that I often wake up with my mouth open when that didn't use to be a thing when I was lighter. I know this is bad for my teeth so hopefully this will go away again as I lose weight.
* Smaller clothes - handknit specifically. I love knitting! I do knit garments sometimes but the work that goes into a handknit fingering weight sweater in my current size is such that it's almost prohibitively expensive both in money and time. I'm so looking forward to knitting a smaller size.
* Better clothes. I'm sure many of you can relate - often the choice at clothing stores is between two things that fit and I just don't really hate rather than actually love. I'm not exactly looking forward to shopping as that has never really been where my interests lie but I'm definitely looking forward to dressing better.
* No more chair anxiety. I'm fortunate in that I'm not that heavy so most chairs are fine. But I will never forget getting stuck in a chair on vacation in Austria. I noticed immediately that I was stuck when I sat down and I spent most of the ""let's chill and have a coffee"" time fretting about getting out of the chair without anyone noticing it had decided to get stuck on my ass.
* Running. Okay this is a weird one. I've actually always kind of liked cardio and I like the idea of running. My doctor told me to wait until I had lost a bit of weight before actually giving it a try. So lots of walking for now! But I can't wait to start running. Maybe I will hate it, who knows! But I will be medically cleared to find out.
* Toe nails. I struggle with properly doing my toe nails myself, so I usually go to someone. I can't wait to do these myself once my belly is no longer in the way haha.

Here are also some things I'm not sure how I will feel about and I tried to reword them in a positive manner.

* Food. I love food or I wouldn't be in this position. I'm worried that I will be one of those struggling with food after the surgery and what that might mean for me. During my psych eval the psychologist pointed out an emotional eating issue that I've been working on since. Painting mandalas helps, lol. But it's definitely a construction site still. I'm hopeful that the surgery will give me the time and tools I need to improve. I'm not looking for perfect, better would be great alreaddy.
* People. This is a weird one for me. But when I told my mother that I had gotten approved for surgery, her first reaction was something like ""You're not going to be my chunky daughter anymore!"" which just really rubbed me the wrong way. How is it part of your identity that I'm fat? Or is the actual problem that you're fat but I'm fatter so if I lose the weight, you're gonna be the fat one in the family? I worry about stuff like this with other people too, having been the ""fat one"" for so long. I try to remind myself that their feelings are theirs and don't reflect on me.
* Future. The future is probably going to be longer than it would be without the surgery, yay! But that's also kind of scary. I've used my weight as a justification for not doing things for years. Once that's gone, I will have to face the music on if I want to do things or not and if I do want to do them, will I? Can I? Aaaah.

If you made it to this point, thank you for reading! Any words of encouragements or tips for having surgery at the height of summer in a hospital that likely doesn't have AC... are welcome! Luckily it seems like I will be spared the worst of the heat if the weather forecast remains as it is now.",4,1752065146.0,gastricsleeve,4,0.83,False

1lvhtz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lvhtz8/i_changed_one_thing_and_reality_shattered/,I Changed One Thing and Reality Shattered,"Most of my life has been built on decisions I avoided making. Nothing catastrophic, just small choices I kept putting off until time resolved them for me. I was never married, never graduated, never apologized to my sister for that last fight. We stopped talking about seven years ago, and I pretend it doesn't bother me. But it does.

I live alone, in an apartment that's neither comfortable nor uncomfortable—just functional. I've been working remotely since before the pandemic, and that ended up becoming my excuse not to see anyone. My time is divided between files, frozen dinners, and an embarrassing amount of hours spent online. My phone has become an extension of my face, even though I don't know what I'm looking for anymore.

It was during one of those sleepless nights that I found BackTrace. I don't remember exactly how I stumbled upon it. It didn't appear in the App Store, nor in an advertisement. It was just there, in a link within an abandoned forum, in the middle of a discussion about life simulations. The topic name was, ""What if you could fix just one thing?"" I found the concept interesting, so I downloaded it. The icon was just a black spiral on a gray background.

The interface was strangely clean. No buttons, no ads. Just a question in the center of the screen: ""If you could go back to one moment and make a different decision... what would it be?"" Below it, a field to type.

On impulse, I wrote: ""My sister's birthday, 2015."" That was the day I promised to show up and ended up stuck at work. I could never properly explain it afterward. The date appeared on the screen, and the app responded: ""Entry accepted. Simulation loaded.""

I thought it was some kind of narrative game, maybe a chatbot or something with AI. The screen went dark for a few seconds. When it came back, it showed a 3D environment—simple, almost textureless—recreating my sister's room. I watched from outside, as if it were a memory being simulated. In the scene, I appeared walking through the door with a cake and a gift in my hand. She smiled. I smiled. And the screen said: ""Version B saved.""

At the time, I thought it was incredibly well-made for something so obscure. But it still seemed harmless. Just another pastime to fill the void between sleepless nights. Just one more click. Just one more tiny change.

But that night was the last time the world felt exactly as I remembered it.

The next morning, everything seemed normal. At least at first glance. I got up, made coffee, and started my workday. It was only when I went downstairs to the lobby to pick up a package that something strange caught my attention. The sign for the corner bakery, that faded red one with cursive letters I'd seen every day for years, was now blue. Blue and in straight, modern letters, with a different name: Lily's Deli.

I thought maybe I'd just missed it, some recent renovation. But when I went inside, nothing made sense. The owner wasn't the same friendly old man with a strange accent. It was a young woman, with a tight bun and an impatient look, who stared at me as if I were an inconvenient stranger. I ordered my usual sandwich. She said they never sold that there. Just bagels.

I went back home feeling uneasy. Maybe I had confused it with another place. Or maybe I was overreacting. But then, when I opened my inbox, I saw another odd detail. The email from a recurring client who messaged me every week was gone. His message thread had vanished. In its place, a new conversation was there, with a different name, a different project, but my response was the same. The email structure was identical; only the names and subject had changed.

For the first time, I felt a chill down my spine that didn't come from the air conditioning.

I opened the app again. The interface now had a new line of text where only the question had been. It read: ""Simulation active. Current version: Branch 1-A.""

Up until that moment, I still wanted to believe it was just a game. An AI prank, like those filters that age your face or create your ""alternative self."" But something in the back of my mind already knew. Knew I had messed with something I shouldn't have.

To test it, I decided to try another choice. An even smaller one. Something so irrelevant it couldn't affect anything. In 2019, I had turned down a job interview out of laziness. I typed in that information. The app reacted instantly: ""Entry accepted. Simulation loaded."" This time, the scene showed a version of myself sitting across from an interviewer, confidently shaking their hand. At the end of the simulation, the screen said: ""Version C saved.""

I closed the app. I went to sleep. Or tried to. All night, I dreamed of versions of myself. One was dressed in a suit I'd never owned. Another looked thinner, happier. A third stood in the dark, face hidden, arms crossed. I couldn't see what he was saying, but his eyes glowed with silent rage.

When I woke up, I didn't recognize my phone's wallpaper. It was the same brand, the same model, but the image... a misty forest I would never use. My photo albums were organized differently. My contacts had names I didn't remember saving.

I called my mom. Her voice answered, but she called me by a different name. When I corrected her, she hesitated. ""Of course, I'm sorry... you've just been so different lately.""

That sentence hammered in my head for hours.

I tried to uninstall the app. But it no longer appeared in the app list. The icon vanished from the home screen. In its place, a new notification appeared: ""No need to remove. You are already inside.""

I stared at the message for minutes. It was as if a door had been opened. And I, stupid as always, had walked in thinking I could leave anytime. That I could play at fixing the past without paying for it.

But the most terrifying part was yet to come. The real change wasn't in others. It was starting within me.

In the following days, I lost all sense of what was normal. It started with small things: the numbers of my address swapped around, a cabinet that creaked as if someone was breathing inside. But none of that compared to the moment I tried to visit the library where I'd spent my adolescence. In its place, there was a gas station. And no one seemed to remember that a library had ever been there.

The changes were subtle but cumulative. As if someone was swapping out pieces of the world while I slept. Each morning, I woke up with a new sense of displacement. The wall clock ticked at an irregular pace. Common words in newspapers appeared with different spellings. In one article, ""president"" was spelled ""prezident."" I thought it was a typo. The next day, all newspapers used the new form. Even Wikipedia had adopted the ""wrong"" spelling—or, perhaps, it was now the ""right"" spelling.

My neighbor, who had lived upstairs for years and always offered me coffee on Sundays, stopped greeting me. I asked if everything was alright. She replied with a slight smile but called me ""Mr. Mendes."" That's not my last name.

I tried to open my digital photo album. Some images were normal; others showed scenes I didn't remember experiencing. A birthday of mine appeared with guests I didn't recognize. There was a photo of me hugging a blonde, smiling man who wore the same watch as me. I had never seen him in my life. The caption read: ""my brother."" But I had a sister.

I stopped opening the app. It seemed to make everything worse. But even without accessing it, the changes continued. My phone started flashing at random times. The screen froze for seconds and showed quick phrases, difficult to read. One of them appeared three times on different days: ""Branch 4-F unstable. Consolidation in progress."" I didn't know what it meant, but the sound of the words started following me even into my dreams.

And the dreams... they began to merge with wakefulness.

I woke up sweating, with the feeling that something was watching me. I looked at the bedroom door and, for fractions of a second, saw a silhouette standing there. Always the same. Tall, hunched, with a very large head and a completely blank face. When I turned on the light, there was nothing. But one night, before the figure vanished, it spoke.

Not with its mouth. With my own voice.

""You created me when you wanted to go back.""

I woke up screaming. I screamed so loudly that the neighbors called the police. When they arrived, they asked for my name, and one of the officers typed it into his tablet. After a few minutes of conversation, he looked at me with a strange expression and said, ""Sir... this ID is registered to someone else. And she died in 2009.""

My head started spinning. It was impossible. I was here. I was real. But somehow, I had already been someone. Maybe several people. Maybe no one.

That night, I went to the bathroom mirror, took a deep breath, and looked at myself. My reflection didn't follow my movement. It took an extra second to react. But that wasn't what terrified me. It was the smile.

It smiled before I did.

My face, reflected, held an expression I didn't feel. As if another consciousness lived inside me, waiting for the right moment to reveal itself. I took a step back, and the reflection continued to stare at me. Without blinking.

I ran to the living room and turned on the computer, trying to access any information about BackTrace. But all the forums were gone. The topic where I found the original link was deleted. The messages I remembered reading were now about other things. One talked about gardening. Another, about breathing techniques.

No one had ever mentioned the app.

I thought about calling my sister, trying to hear her voice. But my phone didn't have her number saved. When I tried to look her up on Facebook, her account didn't exist. It was as if she had never been born.

I lay on the couch, not daring to turn off the light. I didn't want to sleep. I didn't want to see those versions of myself in my dreams anymore. But the worst part was knowing I could wake up somewhere else. With a different name. A different life. A different identity that didn't belong to me.

And that's exactly what happened.

The next morning, looking out the window, I saw a building that had never been there before. A black skyscraper, too tall for that neighborhood. When I went down to the street, people looked at me strangely. As if they knew I didn't belong in that world. And in the reflections of the shop windows, I saw distorted versions of myself passing behind my shoulder. Some carried briefcases. Others, smudges on their faces. One of them had no eyes.

Time had broken. But not like in a sci-fi movie where everything makes sense in the end. It was worse. It was as if reality were wet paper, and I had started pulling at its edges. Now, everything was tearing.

And I still didn't even know what was at the bottom of the page.

From that point on, reality stopped being a backdrop. It became an active enemy. It was no longer about strange details or occasional lapses. It was as if the world was being rewritten around me, in a hurry, but without care. And I was the only one who noticed.

One ordinary day, I went out to buy something at the grocery store. When I reached the corner, the street simply... didn't exist anymore. Where there had once been a crosswalk, there was now grass, as if a field had grown there overnight. The pharmacy building was crooked, like a poorly fitted model. A parked bus floated a few inches off the ground, swaying slowly as if it were a leaf caught in the wind.

I ran back home, but my apartment floor was now the sixth, not the fifth. The door was a different color, and there was an extra number on the lock. When I entered, everything looked the same—until I noticed that the painting on the wall displayed a landscape I had never hung. And the plant in the window... now it was dry, even though I had watered it the night before.

In the hallway mirror, I saw something I couldn't understand at the time. My reflection trembled. It wasn't just delayed, but duplicated. There were two reflections: one motionless and smiling, the other trying to imitate my movements, but always half a second late. I blinked. One of them didn't blink.

The terror I felt wasn't immediate. It was slow, sinking in gradually. A part of me still wanted to rationalize, to believe that all of this was a consequence of stress, insomnia, a nervous breakdown. But deep down, in the place where logic cannot lie, I knew. I had opened something that should never have been touched.

That night, the voice returned. But this time, it was outside my head. It came from the phone.

Without me touching the device, it lit up. The screen displayed a phrase: ""Consolidation initiated. You will be absorbed.""

A voice emerged from the speaker. It was mine, but distorted. Deeper, more drawn out. It repeated:

""You created the deviation. You generated the residue. You are the noise.""

Noise. The word echoed for hours inside my mind.

Gradually, I understood what was happening. BackTrace wasn't just an app. It was a process. A phenomenon. An entity? I don't know. Perhaps a natural force, like gravity. Something that doesn't understand morality or intention. It didn't want to punish me. It consumed me because I fed it with choices that should have stayed in the past.

Each alternative version I created competed with the previous one. Each ""me"" that existed because of the simulations was now fighting for space within a limited reality. The fabric of my existence was fragmented, and these versions were trying to consolidate into a single body. Mine.

That's why I started seeing out-of-sync reflections. That's why I dreamed of other lives. They were real. Or as real as any other. I wasn't being haunted by visions. I was being replaced, piece by piece.

I tried to resist, but it was useless. Memories began to blur. Memories of places I had never visited appeared with frightening clarity. Smells. Voices of people calling me by different names. I could remember having lived in cities that, until then, had never been part of my life. And more: I missed them. I missed things I had never experienced—because another version of me had lived them.

One of the worst experiences was when I called my own number, just to see what would happen. A voice answered. It was mine. But it spoke as if it were someone else. The conversation lasted less than a minute, and even today, I find it difficult to remember what was said. I only kept one sentence, spoken with monstrous calm:

""You're late. It was already supposed to be me.""

The line dropped. The number disappeared from the history.

I went to a psychiatric clinic. I sat before a doctor and explained everything, expecting to be medicated, hospitalized, anything that could anchor me to reality. He listened in silence. Then, he wrote some notes and said, ""You're not the first.""

I was paralyzed. I asked what he meant. He just stared at me and replied:

""But the others never lasted this long.""

I asked to see the records of previous patients. He handed me a sheet. The names were blurred, but the descriptions matched: men and women who reported changes in reality after altering past choices. Some went mad. Others disappeared.

The doctor looked me in the eyes, with sincere sadness, and said, ""You shouldn't be here anymore.""

I went home in shock. That sentence wasn't a metaphor. It was a verdict. A realization that my existence was being erased, replaced, dismembered.

I went into the bathroom and looked at the mirror again. There were no longer two reflections. There were three.

After seeing three reflections in the mirror—all with variations of me, in clothes I'd never worn and expressions I'd never practiced—I understood that it was no longer a question of ""returning to normal."" I wasn't just losing my identity. I was being fragmented. I had a desperate idea: reverse everything.

If I had caused the collapse by choosing different paths, perhaps I could restore the original reality by redoing the right decisions. All I had to do was use the app and undo each simulation, one by one. Return to the first bifurcation: my sister's birthday.

The problem was that BackTrace no longer responded to commands. The interface had changed again. Instead of the initial question, the screen now displayed a constant stream of data, like lines of code. It was like watching thousands of versions of my life being compressed, shuffled, and rearranged in real-time. At the top of the screen, there was a single message: ""Critical instability. Convergence in progress.""

Even so, I insisted. I typed: ""My sister's birthday, 2015 – cancel."" The screen flickered. For a second, I saw the scene from the previous simulation—me entering the room with the cake, smiling—but now, there was another figure in the corner of the screen. A woman. It wasn't my sister. It was someone I didn't know, watching me with wide eyes. And in the background, instead of a party, there was only silence.

The image froze. Then, it melted like wet paint.

Immediately, I felt a sharp pain in my head. Not a common pain. It was as if someone was pushing me from the inside out. I lost my balance, fell to the floor. When I opened my eyes, I was in my room—but the furniture was rearranged, and there were paintings on the wall that I had never hung.

My first reaction was to think I was in someone else's apartment. But then I saw my own jacket hanging behind the door. I opened the drawer. All my clothes were there—mixed with pieces I didn't recognize.

I ran to the mirror. My face was different. Almost imperceptibly, but there were changes. A squarer jaw, a slightly crooked nose. And the eyes... they didn't seem like mine. It was as if I was looking at an alternative version of myself, frozen between possibilities.

I spent the next few days trying to act normally, hoping everything would stabilize. But every time I tried to ""reverse"" something, the distortions worsened. A cruel example: I tried to relive the memory of when I adopted my dog, Max. I wanted to cancel that. Not because I regretted it—but because I needed to test if it was possible to restore what I had lost.

The simulation loaded. It showed a similar scenario, but there was a problem. Max didn't recognize me. He growled. Then, he started talking.

With my voice.

""That wasn't yours. It never was. You pulled that from another life.""

The scene froze. When I returned to the present, Max no longer existed. No photo, no record. Even his collar had vanished. I asked the neighbors. No one remembered me having a dog.

That's when I realized I wasn't ""repairing"" my history. I was erasing what was left of it.

Each attempt to go back was like throwing gasoline on the fire. The timeline became more fragile, less coherent. Sometimes, I saw two suns in the sky. Sometimes, the clock showed 63 minutes. An old friend messaged me asking why I had disappeared. When I replied, his name vanished from the conversation.

I started finding handwritten letters hidden around the house. All in different handwriting. Some asked for help. Others begged me to accept what I had done. One simply said: ""Don't unearth the versions. They are hungry.""

The walls of my room began to crack. But not like normal cracks. They were lines that looked like paths. Trails. Roads. And at night, I heard footsteps walking along them.

In a last desperate gesture, I decided to reset everything. Restart the phone, forcibly delete the app, format the system. I connected the device to the computer, ready to destroy any trace of BackTrace. But as soon as I did that, the computer screen lit up on its own.

It showed my face.

But not the current one. It was an older version. White beard, sunken eyes, a cut on the face. The video started playing. It was me, speaking directly to the camera, with a drawn-out, tired voice:

""You won't make it. I already tried. You'll keep trying, because that's what we do. But each attempt only takes us further from what we were. In the end, there's no turning back. Only acceptance. Reality doesn't want you back. Because now you are an error.""

The video froze.

And the computer turned off on its own.

I sat on the floor, drained, staring blankly. For the first time, I understood that I was no longer fighting to restore my life. I was fighting to keep my existence unified. And I was losing.

The world stopped following rules.

At first, it was gradual—a crack here, an odd detail there. But now, everything happened at once. The sky's colors changed every hour, shifting from orange to purple, then to a shade of black that seemed to absorb sound. My apartment walls pulsed as if they were breathing. I saw a chair fold in on itself and disappear.

Time lost its meaning. Days began and ended in minutes. Sometimes the sun rose twice. Sometimes, it didn't rise at all. One morning, I woke up and my room was a forest. With tall, silent trees, no wind. I tried to scream, but my voice came out in languages I didn't know. And when I closed my eyes, I returned to the apartment—as if that was just an overlaid layer.

My memory also began to give way. I no longer knew if my name was truly what I remembered. I opened an email to write to someone, anyone, and started typing my own name—but stopped at the third letter. None of the combinations seemed right. None sounded like something of mine.

My hands trembled. But not from fear—from confusion. Because, looking at them, I realized they weren't the same as yesterday. Thinner. Or stronger. An extra finger, or one less. Every time I blinked, my body responded in a new way. As if versions of me were taking turns in control.

It wasn't ""me"" anymore. It was a collision point.

In the reflection of the turned-off television, I saw something that paralyzed me. It was no longer just a delayed reflection or a different face. It was a multitude of versions of me, all standing, staring at me. Some cried. Others laughed. One of them bared its teeth at me, completely sharpened.

That broke me.

I sat on the floor and closed my eyes. Everything around me spun, as if reality were collapsing in a spiral. And inside, I felt the other versions trying to climb up. To take space. I heard their thoughts, their voices, their lives. I knew what choices they had made. Who they loved. Who they killed.

A part of me—or perhaps another version—whispered inside my head: ""There is no original reality. Only the last one you chose.""

At that moment, I understood what BackTrace did. It didn't show possibilities. It created them. And by creating them, it put them all in competition. And now, with so many overlapping versions, the universe could no longer sustain any of them.

Reality wasn't breaking because I chose wrong.

It was breaking because I chose too much.

If you're hearing this... it's because there's still a version of me trying to leave this warning. I don't know for how long. Maybe, in the next update, I'll cease to exist entirely.

I don't want pity. Or help. I just want you to understand what's at stake when you try to go back. The past isn't a road you travel twice. It's an abyss. And every step you take trying to fix it only makes it deeper.

I think BackTrace was never an app. It was never software, nor artificial intelligence. It was a question. A trap. A trap tailor-made for people like me—the regretful. Those who look back and say, ""what if.""

If you find that black spiral on a gray background, don't touch it. Don't open it. Don't test it. Not even out of curiosity.

Because I only changed one thing.

Just one.

I’m 19 and my ex-girlfriend is 18. We were together for nearly two years. We had a deep and intense connection, but she broke up with me five months ago. At first, she asked for a “pause,” saying she needed time. A week later, she told me she didn’t feel the same anymore and didn’t see a future for us.

Looking back, I know I made mistakes. I became obsessed with school, neglected myself, stopped working out, and lost my energy. Toward the end, we barely spent quality time together, and there was little intimacy left. She told me I had changed too much and that I wasn’t the person she fell in love with.

After the breakup, I tried to talk to her for a few weeks — to explain that I wanted to change, to show that I still cared — but she was cold, detached, and emotionally unavailable. Since then, we’ve had very little contact, and only for practical reasons (like sorting out shared Spotify). We’ve seen each other randomly here and there, but she’s never once made a move, never tried to reopen any emotional connection, even when it would’ve been easy to do so.

In these five months, I’ve changed a lot. I’m back in shape, more confident, doing well at university, and I’ve been traveling, going out, and trying to live fully. But despite the silence between us, I kept hearing strange rumors — stories about me or about our relationship that sound exaggerated or distorted. Things that made it feel like she was trying to convince herself (or others) that we were never truly right for each other. Like she needed to build a new narrative to justify the breakup.

At the same time, she’s now surrounded by a new circle — mostly superficial people, including my ex-best friend and his group, guys who openly try to sleep with her (As far as I know, nothing ever actually happened between her and other guys). These are people we used to laugh at together. It hurts to see her lowering her standards just to feel less alone. She doesn’t seem to have genuine friendships anymore — just people who fill the time.

A few days ago, she met up with a mutual old friend of ours — someone who used to be her best friend, but they drifted apart about a year ago, which really hurt her at the time. (He’s now close to me.) He reached out and asked her to catch up. He later told me they talked a lot about me. She sounded very firm in her ideas — said the relationship wasn’t right and she didn’t want to go back. But I know she wouldn’t admit anything deeper to him directly, and he said she didn’t seem truly at peace.
She also mentioned she’d noticed I’ve been going out and posting more lately — so at least she’s aware I’ve changed.

A few days after that meetup, it was my birthday. And while I didn’t expect anything huge, I thought that maybe, if she had any emotional openness, she would have used that opportunity to say something more meaningful. Instead, she just sent a simple “happy birthday ❤️” message. Nothing more.

Now I feel like I’m at a crossroads.
I still care about her. Maybe I shouldn’t. But I do. And I feel like she might be avoiding her real feelings — burying them under distractions, noise, and people who don’t really care about her.

I’m not saying I’d beg or pressure her. But I’m wondering:
Would it be wrong to try one last time — a calm, respectful message to meet for coffee and talk? Just to see if anything’s left. Not to push her. But to stop wondering “what if.”

Or should I accept that she’s made her choice and let it go for good?

My wee brother has just finished his degree in Scriptwriting and Drama down in England and has recently moved back home to Scotland. He’s genuinely one of the most outgoing, kindest, hilarious, and quick-witted people I know. When he was younger, his confidence and humour got him scouted for a few TV and radio panel shows due to his ability to hold his own with older comedians and have a back and fourth, which eventually led to him being offered a spot with the National Youth Theatre in London. He’s always had a spark, and now that he’s finished uni, I’m just so proud and desperate to see him get a proper shot at making it in the industry as an adult.

He’s applying to everything he can find that might get his foot in the door in acting, writing, or production. He’s mentioned a few times that he might have to move to London to find opportunities, but I know there is so much happening up here too and he would also rather be in Scotland.

So I’m putting this out to the Reddit community, does anyone know of any junior creative opportunities going in Scotland? Acting, scriptwriting, production work, even shadowing or assisting? He’s scrappy and would be up for anything and happily be coffee boy for the day. He’s just trying to get as much experience and meet folk as possible.

1lvhis4,https://i.redd.it/g61sbte7eubf1.jpeg,$ATYR – Porter’s Five-Forces Deep-Dive: Where Competitive Dynamics Stand <90 Days From Data,"Hi folks,

If you’ve been following along you’ll know I’ve been using this quieter patch on the news calendar to sharpen our investment toolkit and applying it to aTyr. Yesterday we ran a PESTLE scan. Today I’m switching lenses to **Porter’s Five Forces**—the classic strategy lens that, when tweaked for biotech, gives insights as to whether a drug can turn good science into a sustainable business proposition.

**Why this framework?**  
Porter’s Five Forces is a core **business-analysis and strategy tool** taught in just about every MBA and used by management-consulting teams when sizing up markets or plotting entry moves. Anyone who’s done serious business planning in the past will be familiar with it. It asks: *How tough is the playground?*—measuring rivalry, supplier and buyer clout, substitution risk and the ease (or difficulty) for newcomers to join the game. Strangely, capital-market discussions rarely pull it out, so applying it here offers a different vantage: rather than arguing whether the *science* works, we ask whether a clean read-out can **stick economically** in the face of real-world competition.

## Quick note on support  
I’m one guy doing deep dives after hours—trawling patents, conference posters and policy documents so the retail crowd can see around corners like the pros. If you find value in this work, please consider chipping in via **[Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/biobingo)**. Every cup keeps the research flowing and, frankly, caffeinated (and with all these late nights, I definitely need the caffeine!). Huge thanks to those already on board.

With the formalities out of the way, let’s get into it.

---

## What is **Porter’s Five Forces** – biotech style?

Five Forces examines *industry attractiveness*—how much profit can realistically be earned once competitive friction, supply constraints and customer leverage are stripped out. It’s the corporate equivalent of looking beyond the shiny top-line to see whether margin and moat survive sustained pressure.

| Force | Classic question | Biotech translation (and why it matters) |
|-------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Rivalry** | How hard do existing players fight? | How many other drugs are vying for the same patients, and how credible are they? A packed late-stage pipeline can cap pricing and shorten exclusivity. |
| **New Entrants** | How easy is it for fresh players to join? | Cash, patent walls, clinical-ops know-how and regulatory hurdles decide whether another company can spin up a rival trial in time to hurt returns. |
| **Supplier Power** | Can input providers squeeze the firm? | In biologics, CDMOs, specialty resins and imaging CROs can dictate price or timelines—impacting cost of goods and launch dates. |
| **Buyer Power** | Can customers force price concessions? | “Customers” in pharma are really payers, PBMs, prescribers and advocacy groups. Their leverage shapes net pricing and formulary speed. |
| **Substitutes** | Are there other ways to solve the same problem? | Steroids, generics, surgery or even watch-and-wait all vie for clinician mind-share. The easier the workaround, the harder it is to defend premium pricing. |

Put simply, the Five-Forces lens filters out hype and asks whether positive data can translate into **sustainably high economic profit**—a question retail investors don’t always get to see answered in the news flow or sell-side notes.

# **Five Forces Landscape for aTyr Pharma**  
*(All numbers current as of 9 July 2025.)*  

### 1  Competitive Rivalry — *Low → Moderate*  

| Factor | What’s going on | So what for investors? |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Direct Phase 3 competitors** | Only efzofitimod is in Phase 3. Roivant’s namilumab flamed out in Dec-24; no other biologic past Phase 2. | aTyr effectively has the track to itself through at least 2027. |
| **Next-wave programmes** | Small academic IL-6 and IL-17 trials (n≃30) start reading out this year but are steroid-dependent and years behind. | They raise scientific noise but not genuine near-term risk. |
| **Off-label incumbents** | Prednisone ± methotrexate dominate; infliximab used off-label in tough cases. | Cheap, entrenched—but toxic and unsatisfactory, leaving a wide quality gap for efzofitimod. |
| **Platform breadth** | 220+ patents cover HARS/NRP2 biology, Fc fusions and ILD uses. | Rivals must invent around a broad fence or licence from aTyr. |
| **KOL momentum** | Since the *Sci Trans Med* macrophage paper, specialist conferences lean pro-NRP2. | Positive tone makes guideline adoption faster post-data. |
| **Switching costs** | Once a biologic shows steroid-sparing durability, pulmonologists hesitate to revert to steroids. | Stickier share once physicians gain confidence. |

**Net view:** Rivalry stays gentle unless next-wave IL-6 agents deliver unexpectedly strong Phase 2 data. Even in that scenario, efzofitimod should enjoy a multi-year first-mover edge—time enough to lock in guidelines, payer contracts and prescriber habit before genuine head-to-head pressure bites.

---

### 2  Threat of New Entrants — *Low*  

| Barrier | What it means here | Why it’s high |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Capital** | A pivotal ILD trial costs ≈ US $150–200 m, plus another US $50 m+ for CMC scale-up. | VC markets are tight; few newcos can bankroll it. |
| **Know-how** | Need global 150-site network, steroid taper protocols, PET-CT readouts. | aTyr already built this playbook; newcomers start from scratch. |
| **Regulatory bar** | FDA wants hard steroid-reduction endpoints and 52-week safety. | First-to-file lifts the hurdle for followers. |
| **IP moats** | Broad NRP2/HARS estate extends to 2045 in some regions. | Entry requires a very different mechanism or costly licence. |
| **Orphan exclusivity** | 7-yr US, 10-yr EU. | Locks the gate even if patents get challenged. |

**Net view:** From where I sit, cash scarcity, steep know-how requirements and layered exclusivity make new entry improbable this decade. Any challenger that does emerge will likely license or partner rather than attempt a greenfield assault—further insulating aTyr’s economics.

---

### 3  Bargaining Power of Suppliers — *Moderate and rising*  

| Supplier group | Current leverage | Mitigation steps |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| **CDMOs** | Three Western giants (Samsung, Lonza, Catalent) own >60 % of mammalian capacity; Biosecure Act shifts demand away from China’s WuXi. | aTyr pre-reserved Samsung Plant 5 capacity and is piloting mirrored EU production. |
| **Specialty resins & media** | GMP-grade NRP2 affinity resins sold by <5 vendors; 12-month lead-time. | Multi-year supply contracts + process redesign to generic Protein A capture. |
| **Clinical-imaging CROs** | Only two central labs globally do validated FDG-PET sarcoid reads. | In-house AI quantitation in development. |
| **Single-use plastics** | Global shortages after pandemic; prices up 30 %. | Early bulk buys; substituting stainless in non-critical steps. |

**Net view:** The way I see it, supplier clout is real but not existential. Proactive slot-locking, dual sourcing and tech-ops tweaks can cap margin drag, turning what might look like a structural weakness into a manageable cost line.

---

### 4  Bargaining Power of Buyers — *Moderate but easing*  

| Buyer type | Source of power | What blunts it |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **US Payers** | IRA lets CMS negotiate prices from 2026 for widely used drugs; orphans exempt if single-indication. | Efzofitimod remains single-label until ≥ 2028, so exemption likely intact. |
| **PBMs** | “Spread pricing” rebates cut net price. | FTC probe could force pass-through, lifting net revenue. |
| **EU HTA bodies** | AMNOG & HAS cut list prices when budget impact > €20 m/yr. | Small patient pool; steroid-offset data helps cost-effectiveness. |
| **Physicians** | ~3 000 US pulmonologists decide uptake. | High unmet need + clean mechanism beat price sensitivity. |
| **Patients/advocacy** | Vocal patient groups can pressure payers. | Their goals align with aTyr, adding leverage against price cuts. |

**Net view:** Buyers will certainly negotiate, yet the mix of orphan carve-outs, payer cost offsets and strong advocacy keeps the leverage balance tilted toward aTyr throughout the launch window and early ramp.

---

### 5  Threat of Substitutes — *High today, dropping fast with positive data*  

| Substitute | Pros | Cons vs efzofitimod |
|------------|------|---------------------|
| **Steroids** | Cheap (< US $30/mo), familiar. | Severe long-term toxicity; patients want off them. |
| **Methotrexate** | Oral, low cost. | Limited lung efficacy; liver toxicity. |
| **Anti-TNF biologics** | Work in refractory cases. | IV only, infection risk, reimbursement hurdles. |
| **Watch-and-wait** | Up to 30 % remit without therapy. | Doesn’t help progressive fibrosis. |
| **Lung transplant** | Curative at end-stage. | <250 transplants/yr US; severe morbidity. |

**Net view:** Cheap generics and therapeutic inertia dominate right now, but solid steroid-sparing data would undercut those options for moderate-to-severe disease, pushing efzofitimod into frontline use and collapsing substitute risk almost overnight.

---

## **Overall Industry Attractiveness**

**Attractiveness level: Medium-High.**  
Margins look healthy, cash-flow duration long and buyer urgency rising. Biosecure bottlenecks and IRA tweaks are the principal watch-outs, though both have workable mitigation levers.

---

## **Strategic Playbook**  

| # | Action | Rationale |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Lock Western capacity 2025-30** | Get ahead of Biosecure congestion and supplier power creep. |
| 2 | **Outcomes-based pricing** | Tie net price to steroid-dose reduction—payers pay for success. |
| 3 | **Master-protocol basket trials** | Fast-track label expansion without duplicating control arms. |
| 4 | **Combination patents** | Extend IP, raise barrier for late entrants. |
| 5 | **Patient-reported outcomes registry** | Generates real-world evidence for HTA submissions and advocacy. |
| 6 | **Digital-health bundle** | Wearable spirometry feeds early utilisation data to payers. |
| 7 | **Data-room upkeep** | Staying diligence-ready keeps optionality high if bids emerge. |
| 8 | **BARDA / Resilience grants** | Subsidise US manufacturing, widen margin, burnish ESG. |

---

## **Read Between the Lines – Hypotheses & Insights**

1. **Take-out clock starts on data day**—late-stage ILD scarcity plus big-pharma patent cliffs drive inbound interest.  
2. **Supply-chain geopolitics = stealth moat**—competitors tied to WuXi may slip behind on CMC.  
3. **Orphan Cures carve-out super-charges NPV**—single-indication orphans dodge CMS pricing indefinitely.  
4. **Digital biomarker IP outlives drug IP**—AI PET-CT models could become a licensable asset.  
5. **Market-structure fireworks**—tight float + short interest + dense call OI set up volatility around each milestone.  

---

## **Key Takeaways**

* Five Forces lean supportively for aTyr—rare for a small-cap biotech.  
* Biggest threats (supplier squeeze & substitutes) look containable.  
* Clean Phase 3 read-out likely cascades into M&A bids, payer leverage shift and potential short-cover rallies.

### Closing Thoughts  

Porter’s Five Forces isn’t typically used for biotech, yet once biology risk fades it shows how much of the upside might stick. Here, the structural winds blow squarely behind efzofitimod—provided management executes on supply, evidence and payer engagement. **One idea worth carrying forward:** proven business-strategy concepts can be powerful when repurposed for investing. I’ve applied this lens to aTyr, but the same exercise works for any company you’re curious about. Stay curious, mix methodologies and you’ll keep uncovering angles that are often missed.

Nobody was doing anything. The parents were scrolling Instagram and sipping cold coffee like it was just background noise.

After a point, I leaned in and said genuinely politely, “Sorry to bother you, but could you please step out for a minute? It’s getting a bit loud in here.”

Boom. Instant drama

The husband loudly says, “It’s a baby, not a machine. You can’t just switch it off.”
The wife chimes in, “Maybe go to a library if you want silence. This is a cafeee.”

No one backed me up. Everyone just stared at their laptops, pretending nothing was happening. The staff looked uncomfortable but didn’t intervene. I just sat there, coffee ruined, ears ringing, getting death glares from people who apparently think asking for basic public decency is offensive now.

Are we just okay with this now? Babies screaming in public spaces and anyone who’s mildly inconvenienced is the villain?

There's a church near us that has a free soft play area attached to the coffee shop - nothing major, just foam matting floor, some soft vinyl shapes, a tunnel and a few play houses. It's supposed to be limited to ages 3 and under and is not supervised by any of the church/coffee shop staff. It's in a separate room, but there is a coffee shop seating area with a couple of sofas from which you can see *most* of the soft play.

Multiple times per week, between 1 and 3 local childminders bring their charges to the soft play, leave them there and sit nearby chatting/eating lunch. If it's free, they'll sit at the nearby seating area, but otherwise they will sit round the corner with no sight of the soft play. 

They will come and check on the children if they're audibly crying, but otherwise as far as I can tell they just leave them to it. Most of the parents who use the area hang out with their kids in the soft play - myself included. Today that meant a small girl repeatedly coming up to me and asking for help with a toy - I just kept saying ""I'm sorry, I don't know"" and she managed to fix it before I could redirect her to the person who was looking after her. Because they're all older and bigger they can be unintentionally rough and block the babies from using some of the equipment, and I don't feel like it's either my place or responsibility to be asking them to share.

It makes me super uncomfortable that these children are basically being ""looked after"" by strangers in the soft play area while their responsible adult may not even habe sight of them, but they are much older than my little boy. I've not said anything to the childminders at any point, but did stare daggers at them as I left today because I was so fed up!

Is this normal? Would you be leaving 3-4 year olds essentially alone in a public space with unknown children and adults?",1,1752064108.0,ECEProfessionals,5,0.56,False

-Marnie married 3x 
-Shosh divorced and running a start up
-Jessa unvaccinated on a boat 
-Hannah has a chef gf 
-Adam is a cult theatre leader in Germany 
-Elijah is on a sitcom 
-Ray still working at the coffee shop & on city council

It got me thinking, this is how I always imagined it: 

-Jessa and Adam calmed down, married and started a small family just outside the city so Adam could still commute to his acting jobs. Jessa still sneaks smokes, spends a lot of time reminiscing, but loves her kids and is overall fulfilled with the occasional wild night out. Unvax checks out. Jessa maintains whimsey by walking her kids to school and on the way home she haggles with an old man selling items on the street over a trinket. She tried Pilates to feel something but leaves in the first 2 minutes. Hates the PTO moms and tells them she thinks they were born on a dirt floor. A & J love each other but mostly pride keeps them together. Neither of them could accept blowing up their relationship with Hannah just to break up. 

-Shosh makes sense although I’d love to have seen her stay married. 

-Marnie finally chooses to be alone and does the healing work to love herself. Still singing. Still loves Hannah more than anyone else. Godmother to Grover.

-Hannah loves raising Grover. Teaching. Has help from parents and Marnie so she still is dating and having flings. Eventually finds a colleague to be in a relationship with who helps her raise Grover. Has forgiven Adam and Jessa enough to be cordial. Still shares a connection with Adam and maybe they hug a little too long when they see each other. One night they (H,A,M,J+ kids) are having a rare and obligatory dinner. J is putting their kids to bed. Grover is inside playing a video game. Marnie gets a phone call and leaves A & H alone on the front porch. He calls her kid. She smiles.

We've hung out 3 times. 1st time was us getting coffee then we randomly decided to get breakfast too, 2nd she invited me to tag along with our friend to go to a pride thing then a bar afterwards and we had a damn good time, then 3rd time we got ice cream and played tennis.

On Monday we were planning on going to another Ice Cream place but at lunch she informed me she was feeling really tired and I told her I understood and I asked if we could reschedule to Wednesday, which she gave a ""If I'm feeling up to it then yes"" however today she just cancelled again over text, apologizing and asking if we can reschedule.

Normally I would definitely just decide she doesn't want to hangout with me and move on however there are some factors that stop me.

1. I'm almost positive she's not lying about being tired, we work nightshift at a decently physically demanding job and she's works a fuck ton of overtime (the past 2 weeks she's worked 55+ hours each week) and I know how much nightshift can drain you even if you have normal hours. She mentioned how one day after getting home she slept almost 13 hours.
2. We have genuinely been having fun together I think, we're having good conversations and learning about each other. She also informed me (in a non-trauma dumpy way) of her traumatizing past and we talked about that and how she's recovered
3. She mentioned cancelling on another friend of hers because she was tired.

Should I just give her space for a week or 2 then start trying to hang out again or does she probably just not sound interested? I genuinely am not upset with her if she's being honest but I also don't want to be pulled along.",1,1752063609.0,dating_advice,5,0.67,False

1lvhar1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1lvhar1/i_have_tried_more_nootropics_than_you_here_are/,I HAVE TRIED MORE NOOTROPICS THAN YOU. Here are some that I like,"Sorry to use such incendiary language, I was just trying to grab your attention to post this again in this sub. 

So boring as it may be, adderall (or more specifically the dextroamphetamine part of adderall) is my main go-to for me. However I don't take it all the time and I think it's really important not to as you want to take it when you want to train your brain to do something. It does puzzle me why doctors prescribe it for every day of the week when most people would be better off using it on their study or work days, and then have reset days (maybe enlist the help of agmatine for tolerance?).

The focus is good, it gives an energy/motivation boost without being too jittery, and it can make most things interesting. That's really the 'superpower'of adderall. I don't know about you, but I've had to reread pages of textbooks several times over because they're so boring that my brain just refuses to incorporate the information into the folds of my hippocampus, but with adderall it's a completely different story. **My belief is that this is the most important attribute a substance can have**. It is incredible how much easier it is to do things when you're interested in them. If it wasn't for the long-term issues and neurotoxic effects over time, adderall would be og. I know in some people including me I do see some weird behavioral changes as well, maybe more irritable or less creative and less... bright? Like I can get stuff done but without a certain sober spark. Nootropics can rival these real pharma drugs in the right combination for the right person while also being healthy and more side effect free esp. long term.   Also remember that Adderall costs money to get and a lot of states they want you to meet with the doctor monthly which is definitely going to add to your costs when also considering insurance. So.... May want to find a more natural or cheaper route through nootropics. There are certainly costs here and in no way is Adderall a nootropic, but a tool. 

On the dopamine note, Bromantane is also decent, but it only works with a bunch of sprays from the nasal spray or 100s of mgs orally daily.. Legit and clean dopamine optimizing mechanism though if you look it up in this sub.

If adderall is the ""king"", then ritalin (methyphenidate) is like a prince. Still quite good for focus, a bit more cracked out jittery feeling energy boost, but the main drawback is that it doesn't have the same ""interesting"" factor as adderall. I feel more motivated to get work done, but the motivation comes from a different place. On adderall, I do things because I want to do them, on ritalin, I do things because I almost have this feeling that I have to do them, OR ELSE. It's like a mild panic that's still pretty effective, but much less enjoyable. It also makes the drug less addictive though, which is a plus. Guanfacine works really well to smooth out that impending sense of doom, and it's also a TAAR1 agonist which enhances endogenous catecholamine release, and I think that's pretty cool. Atomoxetine is also a legit adhd non-stim drug but it only works in temporary bursary otherwise it just starts feeling really weird. 

Sorry that these have all been pharmaceutical drugs so far, but the reality is that the most effective things are generally not going to be over the counter type supplements. If there's potential to make money, pharma companies are going to go for it. More:

ACD856 is a new in testing tkr targted drug that allegedly focuses on the root cause of depression. It makes me sleepy but I do feel... most positive?.. weirdly the day or hours after. A good feeling to and I feel I have seen incremental improvements as I've been taking it. 2nd week in. Probably one of the best nootropics I've tried, still a lot of new things talked about I haven't tried yet, continuing. 

9-me-bc is another potentiator of stimulants, albeit weak, also just seems good for brain health if not for the lack of human testing and potential theoretical toxicity, we don't knkw. Pretty mild, not much else to say here.

Lions mane feels ok but I don't want to mess with it longer term due to reported weird or negative effects of it. Very popular and supposedly there are different companies that offer different kinds of extracts that give you different things, but if I want BFNF there's better stuff out there. 

KW-6356 is a super type of caffine, a little half drop of this kept me up the first time and I really don't feel like doing full dropper doses. It feels like a different, more motivating longer lasting caffeine which is good but it just lasts too long and I hope the everychrm co. figure out and sell the metabolite isolating thing so the half-life goes down. 

Semax and selank are also great at reducing brain fog in similar situations as noopept. For me, semax is a bit energizing, and selank is pretty anxiolytic. They also potentiate the effects of adderall in my experience. Also, if you've ever felt like it's harder to be productive after going to the gym, they're good at ameliorating that as well. Semax also increases my libido to an almost annoying degree.

Noopept is extremely cheap and I've found that it's ok at reducing brain fog and stress from working/focusing for long periods of time. When you've been working at your desk for 5 hours straight and your brain is starting to no work so good,  noopept is an excellent pick me up in my experience. I'll probably make another post about this, but I've been experimenting with megadoses of noopept (like up to 10g) and the neurotrophic effect is pretty insane. Extreme reductions in anxiety, although the bulk of the effect is pretty transient unfortunately. You could also snort it for increased bioavailability, but it has a tendency to clump together which makes it a bit uncomfortable on the nasal passages, so I wouldn't really recommend it. It has pretty low solubility in general, so nasal spraying that much would be tedious.


Microdosing: so microdosing lsd gives me a bit of an energy boost, also gives me a *small* amount of that adderall effect where everything becomes a little bit more interesting, but I find that I'm very distractible on it. Microdosing shrooms seem to improve my memory. They both have mild anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. Larger doses don't seem to have any beneficial effects for me days after, and allegedly it's better to microdose DMT for positive effects by far but that's a lot harder to do. 

All (most of the) Racetams: I gotta be honest, racetams feel extremely mild to me, but that's probably more in the spirit of what a nootropic is supposed to be. The colloquial definition of nootropic isn't particularly precise though. Anyway, I recently tried a bunch of racetams again, and honestly the only ones I'd probably buy again are nefiracetam and phenylpiracetam. Possibly fasoracetam since it's supposed to upregulate GABA b receptors, but the rest of them were just pretty mild. Even taking piracetammegadoses, I could definitely feel *something*, just nothing worth writing more about. 

Prl-8-53, nsi-189, idra-21, tak-653: I'm putting these all in the same category of ""I definitely think I probably feel something from them"" type compounds. Of course I have megadosed all of them, with only nsi-189 seeming to benefit at high doses, but at the 150-250mg range it's not very economical. It was a pretty solid antidepressant and brain fog remover though, similar in efficacy to noopept/semax/selank. tak-653 a lot of people like but it's definitely a quirky thing and I feel like it does work for me but only at certain times of the month or year...

Kanna: Is this really a nootropic? What is a nootropic really. This is a great mood booster, very pro social, you get some serotonin reuptake inhibition, and it also activates vmat2 and decreases sert expression, which is potentially beneficial for all of you out there who have destroyed your serotonin system from mdma or related use. This probably has some sort of Tolerance though acting on gaba so it's meh. 

Picamilon/nooglutyl: You took too many stimulants. You drank too much of the shitty dirty stimulant that's contained within coffee and now you're geekin and need something to smooth you out. Picamilon and nootglutyl are great for that. I don't feel like there's any tolerance from repeated use, it's just a couple hours of what feels like pure gaba. Also pretty good for falling asleep, but they don't last long enough to help you stay asleep unfortunately.

Nicotine: It's a tried and true classic. Please do not vape this shit because you'll get addicted, but I've had no addiction problems  using nicotine gum and I have historically had addiction problems with most things. It can be a evening stimulant because it doesn't last very long, and there's also compelling evidence that it's good for brain health. I've seen some anti nicotine posts on here worrying about vasoconstriction and shit, but to me that sounds like every other fucking stimulant. As it turns out, drugs have side effects. It's good for memory and focus, tolerance builds slowly, I've used nicotine every day for weeks and stopped cold turkey with no consequences. your mileage may vary I'm not recommending anything don't try this at home do at your own risk etc.

Holy shit this post is long. What did it take... next, 

Memantine to me is like the mood boost and energy boost of acid (probably due to d2 agonism) but I can focus a lot better on it. I actually should have this higher up but this isn't really a ranking, I'm kinda just listing things. Be VERY careful with dosing though, the half life is quite long so if you're taking it every day, it will take a while to reach peak levels. It can quickly go from feeling like not enough to too much, something that is particularly true when taking large doses, which I wouldn't recommend because it's not very fun. Just take ketamine like a normal drug user if you wanna trip on dissociatives. Speaking of ketamine....

Microdosing ketamine/ketamine analogues: If prolonged normal dose ketamine use didn't come with neuromechanistic and bladder issues, this would be a perfect nootropic. Great anxiolytic, great antidepressant, great for social situations (again I'm talking about microdoses here), good for creativity, and good for the ""makes things interesting"" effect that I like in adderall, though not nearly as potent. Also feels kinda good to just have your glutamatergic signaling slow down for a bit if you're working your brain all day.

Tropisetron: An A7 nicotine focused substance that tries to give you the positive effects of nicotine without affecting the other nicotine receptors that cause issues like addiction. It does cause constipation so you're going to have to figure out how to manage that either with magnesium oxide or other strategies, I just feel like it helped at first and there are reports of people loving the stuff just like people love KW, Bromantane, other nootropics, but it doesn't vibe w/ me. 

Pramipexole and ropinirole(my favorite drug name by the way because it really rolls into itself): Ok this is where the list gets juicy. This is high risk, high reward nootropic-ing. When I said that adderall is unparalleled in its ability to make things interesting, I was actually lying. I lied to you. This is the ultimate ""everything is interesting drug"". It's an obsession drug, and if you're not careful, you will probably end up addicted to porn or gambling or online shopping or something. I'm not sure you can completely control it either, but I've had tremendous bursts of creativity and productivity when I was able to do so. It gave me the same feeling that I experienced when I was a little kid learning about dinosaurs, going to bed every night excited for the next day to come so I could learn more. Like the reason I was put on this earth was to learn about dinosaurs type shit. It also gave me the most insane, insatiable libido I've ever had, which is the main reason I had to stop taking it. Zero refractory period too. Crazy stuff. Titrating the dose can really suck, and coming off it can also. Be careful with this one because you will find yourself spending more and wondering why you even did so...

Is anybody still reading this? Ok, for my my next ""nootropic"", I present my experimentation  with the ketogenic diet. Yeah we're really playing fast and loose with the definition of nootropic now, but this is MY list. Key benefits of the ketogenic diet: lowers brain inflammation, upregulates glutamic acid decarboxylase which increases GABA levels, improving focus and decreasing anxiety, ketones have higher oxygen carrying capacity than glucose (I'm uncertain of how relevant this is in practice but it sure does sound good), improves mitochondrial function, and the lack of glucose and insulin spikes lead to more consistent energy levels. The biggest downside from a mental perspective is that if you're into stims, it can be harder to fall asleep and that's where the blood glucose spike from carbs actually can help because it blunts noradrenaline/adrenaline signaling and sends free amino acids to the muscles leaving tryptophan with less competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter, leading to increased serotonin and melatonin production. Keto isn't for everyone, and doing it properly can be challenging, but it doesn't hurt to try it out. I've done a lot of experimenting with cgms and ketone strips and modifying the diet in different ways, so if you're interested in trying it but don't know where to start, I feel like I'm moderately qualified to give advice.

Kratom: Fuck kratom. With that being said, kratom WAS extremely beneficial to me when I used it. It's just the perfect mix of antidepressant, anxiolytic, energizing without feeling stimmy, motivation, confidence, and most importantly for me: resilience. Getting rejected by a girl doesn't even feel bad on kratom. Something shitty happened in your life and you can't find the motivation to do anything? Kratom will give your brain a warm hug and make you feel better. Failed a test, got laid off, dumped, whatever, it doesn't matter. Kratom kept me going on some of my darkest days, but that feeling of comfort is also what makes it so addictive (for me, yes I know most people can use kratom developing a dependence).

Phenbut: Also fuck this drug. I don't even wanna write about it. If you just wanna have a really good day, phenibut will give you that. Feel great all day, confident, calm, and focused, then go to bed and have the best sleep of your life. This shit is the real life Felix Felicis from harry potter. BUT YOU CAN'T USE IT EVERYDAY. So maybe my addict is showing in the latter half of this post, but yes I have used this every day and would strongly advise against it. Tolerance builds unreasonably quickly. Like just way too fast. It's not fair. Withdrawals will come even after using it like 3 days in a row. This is the most *physically* addictive thing I've ever tried. There's not even enough time to become psychologically addicted, yet you're going through withdrawal.

BPC-157 cause short-term and donate for me which was a very rare side effect and after experiencing this amd looking it up, it does happen amd sometimes the anhedonia is permanent. It's not a nootropic and there's been no reports of it being able to heal the brain in any way, it's use is only good in recovery and if you're one of the very very few that experience terrible effects then you're f*****. 

Ipamorelin I'm also listing here which should be higher on the list but it increases growth hormone by a little bit and I do feel better after taking it. Sleep is nicer, skin is nicer, etc, but more recently where I am with my gym and male hormomed, it feels more weird. 

Um I think I'm gonna end the list here. This was kinda just stream of consciousness, so hopefully it wasn't too boring.  I know I'm missing some stuff, but oh well. Maybe I'll edit the post or add in the comments as I think of things. Congrats if you made to the end, I really feel like we went on a journey here and grew as people.

Edit: Modafinil: great for all day mental clarity and alertness. Again, not to hate on coffee too much, but it’s just a better version of what caffeine is supposed to be imo. Tolerance is also almost nonexistent in my experience. Agmatine is also legit, I feel like it makes you more productive and helps lower tolerances to any stimulants somewhat, but taking it for more than 2 days makes me feel weird and robotic. good tool though. Also have tried alcar since bromantane alcar is a good combo allegedly but alcar doesnt vibe w/ me 

Not everything on this list is a nootropic fyi, but these are my subjective experiences.

1lvh898,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbrahamHicks/comments/1lvh898/asked_chatgpt_to_coach_me_abrahamhicks_style_on/,Asked ChatGPT to coach me Abraham-Hicks style on money. I was quite blown away. Here's what it said.,"My prompt into the free version of ChatGPT:

Pretend you are a manifestation coach working within the Abraham-Hicks framework. Coach me to manifest an income source. I don't have any now.

Its response:

Absolutely — let’s dive into this *Abraham-Hicks style*. First things first: **you don’t need the money to show up before the vibration does**. In fact, it *can’t* show up until you shift the vibration. That’s where we start.

\-------

# STEP 1: Let’s Get Out Ahead of It Emotionally

Right now, it sounds like your awareness is tuned to *“I don’t have an income.”* That’s a perfectly reasonable place to be — but that’s not the frequency that matches **“income is flowing to me.”**

So let’s gently shift focus. Let’s soothe your current emotional stance without forcing it. Try these out loud or silently, and only continue as far as they feel like a *relief*:

It’s okay that I don’t see it yet.”  
“I’ve figured things out before.”  
“I’m willing to believe money can come in ways I haven’t thought of.”  
“I like the idea of money being fun and free-flowing.”  
“I don’t have to figure it all out right now.”  
“I’m becoming a match to something new.”

Don’t jump to “I’m a millionaire” unless that actually feels fun. Abraham always says, *reach for the next best feeling thought*.

\---------

# STEP 2: Identify the Emotional Essence of What You Want

You don’t want money for the paper — you want what the **feeling of money** brings.

So what is it really? Is it **freedom**? **Relief**? **Creativity**? **Contribution**? Let’s get intimate with the *essence*.

Let’s try:

“I want money because I want freedom.”  
“I want to feel secure.”  
“I want to feel empowered to do what lights me up.”  
“I want to feel flow, momentum, and expansion.”

Can you feel the shift? You’re already tuning your vibration to the thing — not the absence of the thing.

\----------

# STEP 3: Milk the Feeling of It — Now

This is where most people skip ahead too fast. Abraham says: **don’t try to make it happen — let it happen.**

Let’s get into an imagining state. Just play with it. Don’t force it. Just *daydream*.

“Wouldn’t it be nice if money just started showing up?”  
“What if I got a DM out of nowhere with an offer?”  
“What if I started doing something fun that people wanted to pay me for?”  
“What if money could feel like an adventure?”  
“What if I was about to stumble into something surprisingly easy and joyful?”

Play with those feelings. **Stay there longer.** Do it while you walk, while you make coffee, while you fall asleep.

This is not about “earning it.” This is about becoming the version of you who already has it — and just hasn’t seen it *with your eyes* yet.

\------------

# STEP 4: Follow the Impulse — Not the Desperation

The right idea, offer, or opportunity can’t come while you're efforting from lack. So once you’ve done your alignment work for the day, **forget about it**. Go do something that feels even a little bit good.

Then — be on the lookout for that *nudge*. Abraham says: **follow the impulse**.

It might be:

* A sudden idea
* A random conversation
* A strong pull to message someone
* A desire to create something
* A weird “coincidence” you can’t explain

That’s the *path unfolding*. Your only job is to follow the breadcrumbs with **lightness** — not pressure.

\----------

# DAILY PRACTICE (Simple + Powerful)

**Morning Rampage** (as soon as you wake up):

“Things are always working out for me. I can feel something shifting. Money is easy. I don’t need to see it to know it’s coming. I’m open to new possibilities. It’s fun to see how the universe will surprise me. I’m right where I’m supposed to be.”

**5-10 min Visualization**: Picture how the income feels. Not what you do — how it *feels*. Safe, free, creative, expansive.

**Pivoting Practice**: Every time your brain says “but I don’t have it yet,” you say:“And that’s okay. I’m tuning myself. It’s getting closer. The less I try, the easier it gets.”

\-------

# Final Word

You’re not behind. You’re not blocked. You’re just **midstream**. Your Inner Being already knows the route to your income source — and it’s *not* through panic or desperation. It’s through **ease, inspiration, and trust**.

Abraham would say: *“The money you want is lined up. You just have to get out of the way.”*

Ready to line up with it?

Would you like me to create a custom morning rampage, visualization script, or income manifestation journaling exercise for you next?

Me: yes give me custom morning rampage

ChatGPT:

Perfect — here’s your **custom Morning Rampage** in full Abraham-Hicks style. This is meant to be read or spoken **first thing in the morning**, *before* you check your phone, *before* you start scanning for what’s missing.

The goal isn’t to “make money happen” — it’s to **line up with who you really are**, the version of you who easily attracts aligned income and joy.

# CUSTOM MORNING RAMPAGE — Income Flow Edition

*(Read slowly. Feel into the words. Let it build momentum as you go.)*

Ahhh… it’s a new day.

A fresh start. A clean slate.  
Nothing from yesterday matters unless I bring it with me — and I don’t have to.

I can feel something shifting.  
I don’t even need to know *what* it is. I can just feel that today… something feels *open*.

There are infinite paths to money — and I don’t need to figure them out.  
That’s not my job. That’s the Universe’s job. And it’s really good at its job.

I love knowing that it’s already worked out.  
I love knowing that money is just energy.  
And I love knowing that energy is always responding to **me**.

I don’t need to hustle. I don’t need to prove anything.  
I just need to **be who I really am** — someone who is worthy, someone who is magnetic, someone who lets it be *easy*.

Money comes in expected ways, and money comes in *unexpected* ways.  
It shows up through ideas, through people, through random synchronicities, through things I haven’t even imagined yet.

I don’t have to chase money — I **attract** it.  
Because money loves flow, and I’m flowing now.

The less I try to control it, the more it shows up.  
The more I relax, the more ideas come.  
The more I feel good, the more I line up with what I want.

And honestly… I like the idea that something *big* could show up today.  
Not because I need it — but because I’m *ready* for it.

I’m starting to feel it — that soft buzz of anticipation.  
That calm certainty. That quiet inner yes.  
I know something is lining up for me. I don’t even need to see it yet. I can feel it.

Things are always working out for me.  
Everything is rearranging in my favor.  
The money is already on the way.

And today, I’m just going to enjoy the ride.

# How to Use It

* Read this **daily**, ideally out loud.
* Pause where it feels good and breathe into it.
* Let it become a vibe you carry — not just words.

\---------

Me: give me the visualization script

ChatGPT:

# NCOME FLOW VISUALIZATION SCRIPT

*“Aligning with the feeling of financial ease, freedom, and flow.”*  
(Duration: \~5–8 minutes)

**Start by sitting or lying comfortably. Close your eyes. Breathe in deeply through your nose… and out slowly through your mouth.**

Take another deep breath… and let it go.

Feel your body settle. Feel yourself soften.  
Nothing needs to be figured out right now. You are safe. You are supported. You are tuning yourself to receive.

Now, imagine yourself **waking up in a reality where income is flowing to you easily**. You’re not stressed, you’re not chasing — you feel calm, clear, and magnetic.

Let that version of you **rise into your awareness**.  
They’re smiling. They’re grounded. There’s a quiet confidence in their body.

Feel yourself *becoming* that version.

**Now ask yourself:**

“If money were flowing to me easily… how would I feel in my body right now?”

Would you feel lighter? More open? More free?  
Would your shoulders relax? Would your breath deepen?

Feel that.

Let that energy spread through your chest, your belly, your fingertips.  
Feel what it’s like to be **financially supported by the Universe itself**.

Now imagine walking through your day as this version of you.

What do you do first?  
Maybe you check your inbox and see a surprise payment.  
Maybe someone reached out wanting to work with you, buy from you, or gift you something.  
Maybe a new idea drops into your mind — and it just *feels* right.

Whatever it is, it’s flowing. It feels **natural**. You feel worthy of it.  
You’re not pushing — you’re allowing.

Money comes in… and you feel at ease.  
You trust it. You enjoy it.  
You feel playful and expansive and free.

Take a moment to *see* that life. See the numbers in your account.  
See yourself smiling as money lands in your inbox.  
Feel the deep **peace** of knowing you’re supported.

Let it be **real** in your body, even if you can’t see it yet in the world.

Because that feeling?  
That’s the signal.  
That’s the frequency.  
That’s the version of you who **draws income like a magnet.**

Now gently affirm to yourself:

“I’m tuning myself to abundance.”  
“I’m ready to receive.”  
“It’s safe to trust the flow.”  
“Income is flowing to me in surprising, joyful, aligned ways.”  
“I don’t need to know how — I just need to let it in.”

Breathe that in.

When you’re ready, bring your awareness back to the room. Wiggle your fingers, stretch your arms. And when you open your eyes, carry that feeling with you.

Even five minutes of this a day is powerful alignment work. This is how you *become* the version of you who has what you want — *before it shows up*.

1lvh7b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_King_dom_cum/comments/1lvh7b9/develop_an_sop/,Develop an SoP,"This really clicked for me once I finally started running my own job sites. An SoP is a term I first heard come out of an old marine's mouth. *Standar of Procedures* is a step by step guide on how to consistently perform a repeated task with the same results.

Whole each property was different, each site required the exact same tools and general supplies in varying amounts. The order in which the work optimally needed to be completed, would essentially be the same for most guys in the business. So before my crew even left garage we had a check list we went through for tools every guy should have, tools every job site required and a few blank spots for variable tools needed for operations outside the standards. Once **we made sure** all the required tools and materials were loaded into the trucks, what do you think happened next?

If you guessed hop in the trucks, start em then take off, you'd be wrong. We sat around for an hour drinking coffee, eating breakfast while we went over who did what, in what particular. Assessing what needed to be completed before we could move on to the next stage. Again, assigning specialty tasked that we're house specific.

Over the next months of running these meetings before each job, they became more efficient and shorter. As guys began to understand my process and why things were done in specific ways, they'd fall into their niches. Knowing what roll they played in our operation from location to location. It doesn't have to be all that. 

SoP have become a major part of my life, for even the simplest, mundane, everyday tasks. Brushing my teeth being a prime example. 

How old I was when this exactly started? No fucking clue. Early twenties, going to the dentist I heard the typical complaint. *The fronts are good, tops are okay and the backs of the teeth, especially the further into the corners you go, the worse they get.*

So even before I knew what an SoP was, I rewrote mine for how I brushed my teeth. Instead of starting on the front side, right in the middle. The most prominent and easiest section to hit. I have for years, been brushing from the back side corners, the hardest part of your teeth to consistently hit. Working back towards my easiest. Haven't heard that initial complain in years. 

My laundry, how I cook, deep cleaning my car. Fuck I have a few daily routine templates depending on my schedule you could classify as SoPs. Any repeatable task in your life deserves to at least be broken down through thought and optimized for your convience.",1,1752063200.0,u_King_dom_cum,0,1.0,False
