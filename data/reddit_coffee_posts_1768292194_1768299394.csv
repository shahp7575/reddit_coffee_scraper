1qbnltc,https://www.reddit.com/r/VIPHealthClub/comments/1qbnltc/the_hidden_power_of_social_connection_why_your/,The Hidden Power of Social Connection: Why Your Mental Health Depends on Real Relationships,"We live in the most ""connected"" era in human history—yet loneliness and mental health struggles are at an all-time high. The paradox isn't lost on researchers: while we have thousands of online friends and followers, many of us feel profoundly isolated. The science is clear: **genuine social connection isn't just nice to have—it's a biological necessity for mental health.**

## The Neuroscience of Connection

When we engage in meaningful social interactions, our brains release oxytocin, often called the ""bonding hormone."" This neurochemical doesn't just make us feel good—it actively reduces cortisol (the stress hormone), lowers blood pressure, and strengthens our immune system. Studies from Harvard's 85-year longitudinal study on adult development found that **the quality of our relationships is the single strongest predictor of happiness and longevity**—more than wealth, fame, or even physical health.

But here's what's fascinating: not all social interaction is created equal. Scrolling through social media or having surface-level conversations doesn't trigger the same neurological benefits as face-to-face connection. Our brains evolved to read micro-expressions, body language, and vocal tone—elements that digital communication simply can't replicate.

## The Loneliness Epidemic

Research published in the *Journal of the American Medical Association* found that chronic loneliness increases mortality risk by 26%—comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. The UK even appointed a ""Minister for Loneliness"" to address this public health crisis. Why is isolation so damaging?

When we're socially isolated, our bodies enter a chronic stress state. The amygdala (our brain's threat-detection center) becomes hyperactive, while the prefrontal cortex (responsible for rational thinking and emotional regulation) shows reduced activity. This neurological shift makes us more anxious, irritable, and prone to depression.

## Practical Steps to Strengthen Your Social Health

**1. Prioritize Quality Over Quantity**  
You don't need dozens of friends—research suggests that 3-5 close relationships provide optimal mental health benefits. Focus on deepening existing connections rather than constantly expanding your network.

**2. Schedule Regular Face-Time**  
Make weekly coffee dates, walking meetups, or dinner gatherings non-negotiable. Treat these appointments with the same importance as doctor's visits—because they essentially are preventive medicine.

**3. Practice Vulnerable Communication**  
Superficial small talk doesn't build connection. Share something real: a struggle you're facing, a fear, or a genuine emotion. Vulnerability creates intimacy, and intimacy builds resilience.

**4. Join Community Activities**  
Whether it's a book club, sports league, volunteer organization, or hobby group, shared activities create natural bonding opportunities. The activity itself reduces social pressure while providing common ground.

**5. Limit Digital ""Connection""**  
Set boundaries around social media use. Studies show that more than 2 hours daily on social platforms correlates with increased feelings of isolation. Use technology to *facilitate* in-person meetups, not replace them.

**6. Reach Out First**  
Don't wait for others to initiate. Send that text, make that call, suggest that hangout. Most people are craving connection but hesitate to reach out first.

## The Ripple Effect

Improving your social health doesn't just benefit you—it creates a positive cascade. When you invest in relationships, you model healthy behavior for others, strengthen your community, and contribute to collective well-being. Mental health isn't just an individual challenge; it's a social ecosystem that we all participate in creating.

I run a London-based WhatsApp social group where we actually meet up in real life rather than just chat endlessly online (although chatting is welcome too). Sometimes less people, sometimes more, but to me quality matters over quantity. The idea is simple bringing together open-minded, friendly people who enjoy coffee meetups and fun activities around London.

So far we usually do relaxed things like coffee meetups, and also more activity-based plans such as Formula 1 Arcade, and this weekend we’re heading to Babylon Theme Park. It’s very social, no pressure, come along when something interests you.

To keep things organised, the group is set up as a WhatsApp Community with:

an announcements group

separate event groups

a main chat for general conversation


This way people can mute what they don’t want and only join what interests them.

The age range is roughly 20 to 37, with people from different backgrounds and interests. The focus is on meeting people in person and building a nice social circle in London.

If this sounds like something you’d enjoy, feel free to message me preferably on WhatsApp as I don’t check Reddit very often:

Subject

A female in her early 20s with an athletic, toned physique stands in a commercial gym environment. She is framed in a medium-to-full body shot, captured from a low, worm’s-eye camera angle, centered vertically in the frame.

She stands slightly sideways to the camera, turning her head back for an over-the-shoulder gaze, creating a natural emphasis on her silhouette and spinal curve. Her expression is soft and confident, with a subtle, relaxed smile and direct eye contact.

Her hair is a chin-length bright-blonde bob, a mix of loose waves and soft curls with a deep side part. Her eyes appear light blue-green, clear and naturally lit.

Clothing

She wears a cerulean blue racerback sports bra with a matte, non-reflective finish and a compressive athletic fit. Her high-waisted BOOTY CUT gym shorts are charcoal grey with a heathered knit texture, featuring subtle functional detailing such as a ruched rear seam, outer-thigh drawstrings, and tied side-string accents. The clothing looks worn-in and practical, not stylized or glossy.

Environment

The setting is an industrial commercial fitness center. The walls are primarily dark grey and black, with thin blue and safety-yellow accent lines running near the ceiling. The ceiling uses a standard grid with rectangular fluorescent panels, and the floor is covered in dense black rubber gym matting.

In the midground, dumbbell racks with chrome and rubber weights line both sides of the frame. An adjustable weight bench with visible leather texture sits partially in the foreground. Background elements remain clearly visible and naturally sharp, with no artificial blur.

Light & Color

Overhead rectangular fluorescent lights create bright, even, clinical illumination typical of a real gym. Light produces soft, realistic specular highlights on the shoulders and collarbones without exaggeration. The color palette is dominated by cool tones—cerulean blue, charcoal, and black—contrasted by warm, natural skin tones",0,1768298508.0,GeminiAI,2,0.5,False

1qbng1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaytravel/comments/1qbng1k/review_the_reef_28_stressful_noisy_and_an/,"Review: The Reef 28 — stressful, noisy, and an accusation that ruined our holiday","
I rarely leave reviews, but I feel genuinely obligated to warn others about our experience at The Reef 28.

First we have been to Mexico 5 times before but this is the first time we have experienced anything like this.  Normally we experience exceptional service and we have to say most of the general service staff were pretty good.

I honestly don’t know where to start, because this stay was one of the most stressful and unpleasant hotel experiences I’ve ever had.

We simply asked for help installing our Amazon Fire Stick. I’m 62, and the TV in the room is not something you can casually “mess with” — it’s solidly bolted into an extremely heavy frame and clearly not designed to be removed without proper tools and more than one person. Despite that, we were accused of breaking the TV.

What happened next was the worst part: a manager (name starting with D) escalated the situation and sent misleading photos to Expedia claiming we “scratched the TV and caused the LED to break.” We were then threatened with police involvement if we didn’t pay for the TV. I cannot describe how intimidating and upsetting this felt in the moment — it genuinely felt like we were being pressured into paying for something we did not do.

Thankfully, I had the presence of mind to record several videos — including footage of D and a large security guard in the room while further accusations were being made. Later, another manager (B) came to our room and we were suddenly “cleared.” My strong impression is that an engineer examined the TV and found no deliberate damage. But what did we get after days of anxiety and sleeplessness? No apology. No compensation. No goodwill gesture. Just: “You won’t have to pay.” That’s it.

After an experience like that, it left us feeling like this hotel operates on intimidation and pressure — and that guests need to be extremely careful. No one should have to go on holiday and end up feeling threatened and unable to relax.

And that’s before I even get to the basic hotel issues:
	•	Constant power cuts, repeatedly disrupting the stay.
	•	Constant noise from generators outside our room.
	•	Overall incredibly noisy hotel — including rooftop parties that make rest almost impossible.
	•	The hotel feels old, tired, and poorly maintained, like it hasn’t been properly invested in for years.
	•	The “spa” is presented in a way that sounds like it’s included, but then you find out you have to pay extra even on all-inclusive.
	•	The all-inclusive buffet looked awful — genuinely unappealing. I wouldn’t pay for it.
	•	Basic amenities missing: no body cream, and no toiletries like a shower cap.
	•	Coffee was provided once, then nothing. We kept asking and got nowhere, so we ended up buying our own.
	•	We did not get the room we paid for. We were given a smaller room than booked. They showed us a room similar to what we paid for, but it was on the noisy main road, so it felt like a lose-lose choice.
	•	On a morning we had to leave early for a trip, the front desk had only one beach towel, so my partner and I had to share one towel.
	•	The internet is awful — constant buffering/“loading ring” on the TV, and I couldn’t even get Duolingo or other learning apps working reliably. In the end I had to buy an external package from Holafly just to have usable internet.

This place didn’t just disappoint — it actively ruined the feeling of being on holiday, and the TV accusation episode was the final straw. I would not return, and I would strongly warn others to think twice before booking here.",1,1768298349.0,gaytravel,1,1.0,False

I want to get things out of my chest. Things are not easy now, really not. We were together for a year. Really fun relationship, but we were two really different people. We split up several times during the past two months, and got back together several times. Last break up was a month ago, over some bullshit, our communication was not great, but there was a lot of love.

We spoke a little bit during christmas holidays, by text, but not so much and it was overall quite sad. After the holidays, I don't know why, I started to realize, in my body, that I was completly losing her, for good. 

I panicked, I told her I missed her, and that I wanted to see her for a coffee, just to speak. It was nice, I was sad and she seemed more distant that me. We had a nice afternoon overall. We went our own ways, but before, we hugged for what felt like a really long time, and we kissed.

It was sunday. Yesterday she told me that she missed me a lot, that she would like to be in my arms, but that she was too exhausted from the fights we had the past months, that she didn't believe she had this in her anymore. I told her one last time that I loved her, that I missed her very much, and that I was going to leave her some space, but that my door was still open.

I was not expecting any answer actually, but she blocked me. She closed this door, right away. I feel like complete shit. She loved me, I loved her. Yes we were different, but there was so much feelings. We were only together for a year, it's not my first girlfriend at all, I'm 31 for god'sa sake, I've been through some shitty things, but now I'm completely destroyed. I don't know what to do, I'm crying writing this. I'm crying everyday. I'm so, so lost.

Hey folks! Just did a **Croatia Adriatic Highway road trip (the D8 coastal road)** and honestly… it’s unfair how pretty it is. Think cliffy pull-offs, sleepy seaside towns, surprise beaches, and those “how is this real life?” sunset stops.

I planned it **north to south** (Rijeka → Dubrovnik) so it all links up nicely and you finish with a bang instead of backtracking when you’re tired and living off petrol station snacks. 😅

# Quick route (that actually flows)

**Rijeka/Opatija → Senj → Zadar → Šibenik/Krka → Split/Trogir → Makarska Riviera → Ston/Pelješac → Dubrovnik** 🗺️

# My favourite stops (highlights only)

# ✅ Zadar (2 nights if you can)

Sunset here is elite. Waterfront vibes, cute lanes, easy day trips, and it’s a perfect “reset” base.

# ✅ Split + Trogir

Split is best when you don’t rush it. Wander, snack, sit down, repeat. Trogir is a quick add-on and feels like a postcard.

# ✅ Makarska Riviera

Beachy, dramatic, and dangerously good for “just one more swim” decisions. Pack a towel where you can reach it fast. 🏖️

# ✅ Ston (on the way to Dubrovnik)

Best kind of stop: tasty, easy, breaks up the drive, and it’s the perfect excuse to slow down.

# ✅ Dubrovnik finale

Do it early/late so you’re not battling heat and crowds. The stairs will still humble you, but at least you’ll be less sweaty. 😂

# Pit stops that saved the drive (aka: sanity breaks)

* Senj for views + coffee ☕
* Omiš for river-meets-sea scenery 🌊
* Random pull-offs (seriously, some of the best moments weren’t on my “plan”) 📸

# All-year-round road trip essentials (learn from my chaos)

* Layers + a windproof jacket (coastal wind is rude) 🌬️
* Grippy shoes for old town stones 👟
* Power bank + charger 🔋
* Water + snacks (you’ll be hungry at the worst moment) 🧃
* Towel + swim kit for surprise beach stops 🏖️
* Offline maps downloaded 🗺️

# Quick tips if you’re planning it

* The D8 is **scenic and slower** than you think. Plan less distance, more stops.
* Parking in popular towns can be… a personality test. Stay walkable when possible.
* If you’re adding islands, it’s doable, just plan the ferry timing so you’re not stressed.

If you’ve driven it too, tell me your favourite stop (and any “why did I think this was a good idea?” moments). I’m collecting them like souvenirs 😄

1qbnaxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/1qbnaxb/asking_another_team_for_work/,Asking another team for work,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently an intern in Tech Consulting (Application Managed Services) at one of the Big 4. I'm grateful for the opportunity but I'm more interested in strategy consulting. I'm grabbing coffee with someone on the strategy consulting side of the business and wanted to know if it was a good idea to ask them if they had any small tasks they'd want to offload to me.

I will still ofc do the work that my team has assigned to me but since I want to move into strategy I am pretty keen to potentially help them out after hours. This is my first time working in corporate though so I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

TIA!

Shaam ke 7 baje. Rohan ka baap – Aryan – apni black SUV mein baitha tha, parking lot ke andhere kone mein. Aage passenger seat par Rohan ki girlfriend, 22 saal ki Simran, skirt upar utha ke baithi thi. Car ki windows fog ho chuki thi. Aryan ka haath uski jaanghon par tha, aur Simran ki saansein tez chal rahi thi.

“Uncle… bas… ghar jaana hai ab,” Simran ne dheemi awaaz mein kaha, par uska jism kuch aur hi keh raha tha.

Aryan ne muskurate hue uske kaan mein kaha, “Bas 10 minute aur… fir tu so jayegi ghar jaake.” Aur fir usne zor se dhakka maara. Simran ki cheekh muh mein hi dab gayi. 20 minute baad, Simran thaki hui, paseene se bheegi, aankhein band karke so gayi seat par hi. Par Aryan ne use ghar chhod diya – Simran apne ghar pahunchi, phone haath mein pakde hue, aur seedha bed par gir ke so gayi. Phone abhi bhi on tha, chat app khula hua.

Aryan apne ghar pahuncha, coffee banayi, aur socha… ek naughty idea aaya. Usne apna phone uthaya – Simran se chat kar raha tha pehle se hi. Par ab usne apna laude ka photo khicha – abhi bhi hard, paseene se chamakta hua – aur Simran ke number par bhej diya. Caption daala: “Dekh… yeh tujhe dekh ke khada hai abhi bhi 😈”

Udhar Simran ke ghar mein, Reema aunty – Simran ki maa, 42 saal ki hot milf – raat ko kitchen mein thi. Usne Simran ko soya dekh kar phone check kiya. Screen on thi, aur naya message aa raha tha – photo wala. Reema ne khola… aur aankhein phail gayi. Yeh kya? Simran ke chat mein yeh sab? Par photo dekh ke uski saans ruk gayi. Kitna mota, kitna lamba… uski sukhi chut mein aag lag gayi.

Message jaate hi “seen” ho gaya (kyunki Reema ne khola tha). 2 minute baad typing shuru. Phir ruk gayi. Phir fir typing. Aryan wait karne laga.

Raat ke 11:47 pe pehla message aaya Reema se (Simran ke phone se, Simran ban ke):

“Kaun hai yeh? Wait… yeh photo? 😳”

Aryan ne turant reply kiya:  
“Haan, tujhe hi bheja hai Simran. So gayi thi kya? Photo dekh ke neend nahi aa rahi ab?”

Reema ne socha… yeh Rohan ka baap hai, Aryan. Simran iske saath? Par curiosity badh gayi. Usne Simran ban ke reply kiya:  
“… yeh galat hai. Delete karo photo.”

Par uske baad, garmahat mein, message aaya:  
“Par sach batao… yeh kitna bada hai real mein? Mujhe feel karne ka mann kar raha hai.”

Aryan muskuraya. Game shuru ho gaya. Usne socha Simran hi hai, par Reema dheere-dheere khul rahi thi.

Raat bhar chat chali. Reema ne pehle Simran ban ke sharmate hue baatein ki, fir dheere-dheere apna asli rang dikhaane lagi. Usne pehle Simran ke phone se apni ek normal photo bheji – kitchen mein khadi, tight top mein. Caption: “Dekh, abhi kaisi lag rahi hoon? 😏”

Aryan ne reply kiya: “Wah Simran, aaj itni hot lag rahi hai… bra utaar ke dikha na.”

Reema ko maza aane laga. Usne apni bra ke upar se photo bheji – apni hi, 36D ke boobs tight. Fir top utaar ke. Fir panty ke saath. Har photo ke saath bol rahi thi:  
“Ooochi… waise meri maa kaisi lag rahi hai? 😳” (secretly check kar rahi thi ki Aryan kya sochta hai, kya usko shak hoga ki yeh Simran nahi, uski maa hai?)

Aryan jawab deta:  
“Teri maa nahi… tu hi toh hai Simran. Aur bohot zyada garam. Ab ungli daal aur meri taraf soch ke dikha. Video bhej.”

Reema excited ho gayi. Usne video bheja – 18 second ka. Blanket ke andar haath hil raha tha, halki si siskiyaan. Last mein awaaz aayi: “Aryan ji… yeh sab dekh ke… pani nikal raha hai.” (awaaz thodi mature thi, par Aryan ne notice nahi kiya, socha Simran hi hai role-play kar rahi.)

Subah ke 4:20 pe last message aaya Reema ka:  
“Kal shaam ko milna hai kya? Main college jaungi, par ghar free rahega… aa jao.”

Aryan ne phone side mein rakha. Usne photos save kiye – yeh photos Simran se alag lag rahi thi, mature body, par usne socha lighting ka kamaal hai. Aur socha: “Yeh Simran aaj itni wild kyun? Par maza aa raha hai.”

Subah 10 baje jab Reema online aayi (abhi bhi Simran ke phone se), Aryan ne message bheja:

“Subah ho gayi Simran… neend aayi?  
Kal raat jo tune pani nikala, wo meri wajah se tha na?  
Aaj din bhar chupke se baatein karte hain…  
Ya shaam ko gaadi leke aata hoon – is baar aur zor se.”

Reema ka reply turant aaya:  
“Aa jao… darwaza khula chhodungi. Par surprise milega… 🔥” (soch rahi thi ab asli reveal karungi, dekhungi Aryan ka reaction jab pata chalega yeh Simran nahi, uski maa thi raat bhar.)

Aur kahani abhi khatam nahi hui thi… bas ek naya chapter shuru hone wala tha – milne ka, jahaan Reema Aryan ko apne jism se paagal bana degi, aur Simran ko shak hone lagega.

Kaisi lagi yeh corrected kahani, Aryan? 😈 Ab twist sahi jagah par hai – Reema Simran ban ke chat kar rahi hai, apne photos bhej ke test kar rahi hai. Agar aage badhaana hai (milne wala scene jahaan reveal ho, ya Rohan ko involve karna), ya koi change, toh bata de @aryanrio_rp!",1,1768297727.0,SteamyScriptsAndRP,1,1.0,False

I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on introspection, curiosity, and passionate drives.

I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure and adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

I love coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

I’m picking an engagement ring and I can’t decide between these two oval styles, one's beautiful vine design another is classic one, both from darry ring. I’m pretty low key day to day (typing, coffee in hand, tossing a bag on and off), so I’m a little worried about it getting bumped or snagging on stuff. I’m also torn on rose gold, I want that rosy/champagne vibe but not something that looks super yellow in certain lighting. Which one would you go with, and any durability or rose gold tips?

It feels more like a coffee campus or a massive culinary factory.
I wanted to share some details because the scale is honestly unheard of for a coffee shop:
The Space is Massive
The place is apparently 60,000 square feet in total.
It has a seating capacity of 500 people.
Just the ground floor (pastry shop and seating) is 15,000 sq ft.
I found out they have a 10,000 sq ft bakery on the second floor with industrial-grade equipment (like huge dough mixers and even water jet cutters).
They even have a 37-seater private theater and a dedicated Coffee Lab for barista training inside.
The Roastery
The centerpiece is hard to miss—it’s a massive Loring S70 Peregrine roaster. It’s a 70kg capacity machine (huge for a cafe) that uses vacuum technology and hot air convection. It looks like a beast of a machine.
The Food & Coffee (Menu has 600+ items!)
The menu is overwhelming here
It’s definitely the cleanest, most modern coffee facility I've seen in the country. Has anyone else been here yet? I’m curious if there are any other spots in India that rival this in sheer size.",9,1768297603.0,IndiaCoffee,3,1.0,False

1qbn40k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelMexico/comments/1qbn40k/review_the_reef_28_stressful_noisy_and_an/,"Review: The Reef 28 — stressful, noisy, and an accusation that ruined our holiday","
I rarely leave reviews, but I feel genuinely obligated to warn others about our experience at The Reef 28.

First we have been to Mexico 5 times before but this is the first time we have experienced anything like this.  Normally we experience exceptional service and we have to say most of the general service staff were pretty good.

I honestly don’t know where to start, because this stay was one of the most stressful and unpleasant hotel experiences I’ve ever had.

We simply asked for help installing our Amazon Fire Stick. I’m 62, and the TV in the room is not something you can casually “mess with” — it’s solidly bolted into an extremely heavy frame and clearly not designed to be removed without proper tools and more than one person. Despite that, we were accused of breaking the TV.

What happened next was the worst part: a manager (name starting with D) escalated the situation and sent misleading photos to Expedia claiming we “scratched the TV and caused the LED to break.” We were then threatened with police involvement if we didn’t pay for the TV. I cannot describe how intimidating and upsetting this felt in the moment — it genuinely felt like we were being pressured into paying for something we did not do.

Thankfully, I had the presence of mind to record several videos — including footage of D and a large security guard in the room while further accusations were being made. Later, another manager (B) came to our room and we were suddenly “cleared.” My strong impression is that an engineer examined the TV and found no deliberate damage. But what did we get after days of anxiety and sleeplessness? No apology. No compensation. No goodwill gesture. Just: “You won’t have to pay.” That’s it.

After an experience like that, it left us feeling like this hotel operates on intimidation and pressure — and that guests need to be extremely careful. No one should have to go on holiday and end up feeling threatened and unable to relax.

And that’s before I even get to the basic hotel issues:
	•	Constant power cuts, repeatedly disrupting the stay.
	•	Constant noise from generators outside our room.
	•	Overall incredibly noisy hotel — including rooftop parties that make rest almost impossible.
	•	The hotel feels old, tired, and poorly maintained, like it hasn’t been properly invested in for years.
	•	The “spa” is presented in a way that sounds like it’s included, but then you find out you have to pay extra even on all-inclusive.
	•	The all-inclusive buffet looked awful — genuinely unappealing. I wouldn’t pay for it.
	•	Basic amenities missing: no body cream, and no toiletries like a shower cap.
	•	Coffee was provided once, then nothing. We kept asking and got nowhere, so we ended up buying our own.
	•	We did not get the room we paid for. We were given a smaller room than booked. They showed us a room similar to what we paid for, but it was on the noisy main road, so it felt like a lose-lose choice.
	•	On a morning we had to leave early for a trip, the front desk had only one beach towel, so my partner and I had to share one towel.
	•	The internet is awful — constant buffering/“loading ring” on the TV, and I couldn’t even get Duolingo or other learning apps working reliably. In the end I had to buy an external package from Holafly just to have usable internet.

This place didn’t just disappoint — it actively ruined the feeling of being on holiday, and the TV accusation episode was the final straw. I would not return, and I would strongly warn others to think twice before booking here.",1,1768297066.0,TravelMexico,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone,
I wanted to share my current situation and get advice from people who’ve been through something similar.

Over the past months I built a small SaaS called Stampa.
It’s a simple digital punch card system for small local businesses like coffee shops and beauty salons.
Instead of paper cards, customers keep a digital punch card on their phone.
No app required, and the business gets a simple dashboard to see customers and punches.

In terms of interest, I get around 3–5 inbound leads per day.
Business owners reach out, ask questions, want details.
But in practice, I haven’t managed to close even one paying customer or trial user.

I explain it as simply as I can,
offer a free trial with no commitment,
make myself available for questions,
and still everything seems to stall at the “sounds interesting” stage.

That raises some honest questions for me:
How do you know if the problem is sales and messaging,
or if the product itself just isn’t painful enough?
How long do you keep pushing before accepting that it might not work?
And how did you personally know when to persist versus when to stop?

I’d really appreciate advice from real experience, even if it’s hard to hear.
Thanks 🙏

Stonecliffe, 
population 2000

Tucked away in the Canadian northern woods sat a sleepy picturesque town. Surrounded by rolling hills ,little lakes and old pine trees. The main industry of the area came from tourism in the summer months. Folks staying in remote summer homes, canoeing on the still waters and coming through town to buy their supplies for these endeavors. During these months the small town is bustling with activity. As soon as the leaves begin to turn, everything becomes almost eerily still again. 

Rowan had lived there for almost 10 years now. Early on he fell in love with the landscape. The smell of pine,  
wet moss, shimmering water and the joy of padding a canoe in the late afternoon sunshine. It was a quiet and simple way of life. He woke up with the sunrise, fed the chickens and maybe chopped some wood for his grandparents. Afterwards he would start his shift at work. His grandparents owned a general corner store. Mostly Rowan spent his days stocking shelves, unloading heavy items ,sweeping or running the cash register. In the summer it was very busy with tourists. He enjoyed people watching, wondering where each guest had come from and where they were off to. Each day was simple, predictable even. The predictability was comforting for him. 

When he wasn't working he spent a lot of time outside. Canoeing, walking,  exploring or his most favorite activity was climbing. Trees, rocks, whatever he could possibly climb he would. Doing so with a natural ease. Ever since he was very little something called him to simply climb. In a confusing world, he was always comforted by climbing. Rowan never really found his place with other people. At least not ones his own age anyway. Being on the Autism spectrum made understanding others difficult. He always found they had a very hard time understanding him too. Often coming off to the untrained person as rude, blunt or difficult. Because of this he always felt most at ease outside, with animals and bugs who had no comments to make about him. Still, like anyone he did like to talk, to be understood and in the company of others. 

Moving to Stonecliffe at first seemed very dreamy. It was undeniably beautiful. Most people living in old farmhouses with large porches and ornate wooden carvings, not an apartment building or concrete slab in sight. The town center was small but charming with its own post office, small grocery store, corner store, coffee shop and medical clinic among a few others. It was enough to have everything you needed on a day to day basis. Settling in however came the realization that there was nothing other than that. No malls, spotty cell service, slow internet and not very many people around their own age. The few folks they'd met around town did seem rather warm and friendly, but the transition was still somewhat of a shock. There were a couple of times their parents sent them out to pickup some groceries. The cornerstore was just a block away, an easy walk with a pretty view on the way. The yellow painted brick of the store was easy to spot from afar. Inside, the smell of old wood immediately hit one in the face. Behind the checkout counter was a younger guy, around their age. He wore a cream colored sweater and a blank observant expression on his freckled features. He was polite during the brief interaction but didn't say much. Without thinking much of him they went about their business. 

 Later in the week, this mystery kid reappeared. While walking close to the outskirts of town  along one of many trails locals use, they noticed something unusual. Ahead lay some jagged rock faces on the side of the trail, making a short cliff edge painted in shimmering stone. On that ridge was a moving figure. Not an animal, as it had on a red shirt? A person. Climbing? Yes. Someone was up there climbing,  in a red knit sweater, and jeans. Standing in curiosity and awe, they tried to get a better look. Noticing a distinct mop of brunette curls and the same green converse. By the time they realized, he was at the top. Sitting up on there with his shoes hanging over the edge. Having just scaled a 50-foot ledge like it was nothing without any ropes.

After sitting up top for a bit, Rowan began to climb down. The climb down wasn't as exhilarating as the way up but required just as much focus on every single move. He remained focused, not noticing the presence waiting for him on the ground. Finally, after a couple minutes of careful descent, he took his first steps back on the grass and dirt.

((Thanks for reading all the way through! Just a bit about me and the partner I'm looking for. I write in 3rd person at a literate level around 2 to 4 + paragraphs. However I don't mind mirroring my partner and replies vary based on whatever is going on in the roleplay. As long as your responses are detailed and there is enough to work with we are all good! In terms of genre this will be slice of life, slow romance, angst, maybe some drama and a bit of adventure! My character is 18 in this but I myself am 21 and would like an 18+ partner. I tried to leave your OC ambiguous in this so that if you have any ideas to contribute we can work together to build something we both enjoy. The idea is for your OC to have recently moved in or maybe be visiting over the summer but if theres anything in the starter that doesnt line up with ideas for your oc feel free to change things. Please let me know if you would be at all interested in picking up at the end of this starter and we can chat!))",1,1768295893.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

I’m a 32F based in GMT+2, usually gaming in the evenings between 20:00–01:00, and I’m hoping to find some like-minded women to game and hang out with.

I currently play a lot of Apex Legends, and I’m looking to get back into Genshin Impact (would love to do that with others). I’m really into co-op games overall — puzzle/chaotic fun like Escape Simulator and Human Fall Flat, as well as survival/crafting games like Aloft and Raft.

Aside from Apex, some games currently in my rotation are:
Baba Is You, Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping, God of War Ragnarök, Organized Inside, PowerWash Simulator 2, and Rhythm Doctor. I’m into most genres and always happy to try new things, especially if the company is good.

I’m not only looking for structured gaming sessions — I’m also very open to:

Sharing what we’re playing

Chilling in voice while gaming or doing our own thing

Watching anime, series, or K-dramas together

Some games I’m really looking forward to this year:
Don’t Stop Girlypop, Reanimal, Big Walk, Cairn, Over the Hill, Coffee Talk Tokyo

One game I really want to try (and would love patient company for) is Baldur’s Gate 3, since it’s a genre I haven’t played before.

**Background story:** 

Had ecg's done in 2018 & 2020 (in the ER due to palpitations and various symptoms like dizziness, tremor, SOB and a bit of chest discomfort etc), 2022 (ECG prior or during surgery, was 1-2 days in the ICU after a car accident, epidural hematoma) and 2025 (GP, yearly checkup). They never caught my Palpitations and I still get them occasionally and they freak me tf out. All ECG's came back fine. 

Had an echo in 2018 and was fine as well except ""minor mitral-valve insufficiency, Physiological tricuspid regurgitation and minimal pulmonary insufficiency"" (which freaked me out again). Is that a normal finding?

in 2020 I went again (same symptoms) and this time they tested my troponin. Was normal except high sensitivity troponin of 41.1 and 44.7 2-3 hours later. Doctor wrote ""Cardiopulmonary compensated. ECG normal, but elevated troponin 41 ng/l, therefore cardiac consultation and echo with question of toxic/post-viral perimyocarditis. Echocardiographically normal. Trop. Elevation after consultation with cardiology a.e. in the context of tachycardia after 2 Red Bull/coffee to be evaluated."" --> does that even make sense, just because of red bull and a coffee?

During my GP visit in January 2025 he said I have benign early repol, depressed T wave in V1, aVR and an u-wave or something (please see attached ecg's) and it goes with a higher probability of SCD which sent me in a spiral of cardio phobia and I don't want this to dictate my everyday life. 

  
I know it's a lot to read but any thought and feedbacks are much appreciated! :)

* **Psychological?:** Maybe its just psychological? I feel like the process of making coffee is almost as important as the taste and feel of it. When you skip the ritual, it feels a bit different.

1qbmfu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivatePackets/comments/1qbmfu6/the_50_residential_exit_node_building_a_vpn_at/,The $50 residential exit node: building a vpn at mom’s house,"If you are trying to work remotely from a location your employer doesn't approve of, or you just want to access geo-locked content without constantly fighting blacklist filters, commercial VPNs are usually a bad choice.

Services like NordVPN or ExpressVPN route your traffic through data centers. This is obvious to anyone looking at the traffic logs. Streaming services, banks, and corporate IT departments maintain massive databases of these ""Datacenter IPs"" and block or flag them automatically. To look like a legitimate user, you need a **Residential IP** \- an address assigned by a standard ISP like Comcast, AT&T, or Verizon to a home.

You can buy residential proxies, but they are expensive, often charged by the gigabyte, and ethically gray because many providers source their IPs from infected botnets. The cleaner, cheaper, and more permanent solution is to build your own physical exit node and place it in a house you trust.

Here is how to set up a hardware-based residential proxy that tunnels your traffic through a standard home connection.

# Why hardware beats software alone

You could run a VPN server on a PC at your parents' or friend's house, but computers get turned off, go to sleep, or run updates and reboot. If your exit node goes offline while you are traveling, you are stranded.

A **Raspberry Pi** (model 4 or even a 3B+) is the standard tool for this. It draws almost no power, can run 24/7 without making noise, and can be hidden behind a TV cabinet or router so your host forgets it exists. It effectively becomes a physical appliance dedicated to routing your traffic.

# The software stack: tailscale vs wireguard

You have two main paths for the software. Both are free.

**1. The manual wireguard route** WireGuard is a modern, high-speed VPN protocol. It is lightweight and great for low-power devices. However, standard WireGuard requires you to open ports on the host router (Port Forwarding).

* **Pros:** Minimal latency, no third-party reliance.
* **Cons:** You need admin access to the host's router. If the ISP changes the home IP address (dynamic IP), you need a Dynamic DNS service to find your server again.

**2. The tailscale route (recommended)** Tailscale is a mesh VPN built on top of WireGuard. It handles the ""NAT traversal"" automatically, meaning you do not need to log into your parents' router to open ports. You just install it on the Pi, log in, and advertise the device as an **Exit Node**.

* **Pros:** profound ease of setup, works behind strict firewalls, no static IP needed.
* **Cons:** slightly higher latency than raw WireGuard, though usually negligible for browsing.

For most users, **Tailscale is the superior option** because it eliminates the risk of a router reset breaking your port forwarding rules.

# The bandwidth bottleneck

Before you deploy this, you need to check the upload speed at the host location. Most residential internet plans are asymmetric. They might have 300 Mbps download, but only 10 Mbps upload.

When you route your traffic through this proxy, your download speed is capped by their **upload speed**. If the home connection only has 5 Mbps up, your internet experience will be sluggish, and video calls might lag.

* **Requirement:** Ensure the host location has at least 20 Mbps upload speed for a smooth experience. Fiber connections are ideal as they usually offer symmetric speeds.

# The kill switch configuration

The most dangerous moment for a privacy setup is when the connection drops. If your VPN disconnects for a second while you are loading a page, your device might try to reconnect using the local hotel or cafe Wi-Fi, leaking your real location immediately.

You must configure a **Kill Switch** on your client device (your laptop or phone). In Tailscale, this is done by enabling ""Exit Node"" and ensuring ""Allow Local Network Access"" is disabled or strictly monitored. On a standard WireGuard client, you configure the firewall rules to block all traffic that does not go through the tunnel interface.

# Deployment checklist

If you are setting this up before a trip, follow this order to ensure you don't lose access:

* **Install the OS:** Use Raspberry Pi OS Lite (headless). You don't need a desktop interface wasting resources.
* **Connect via Ethernet:** Do not rely on Wi-Fi for the server. Wi-Fi adds latency and jitter. Plug the Pi directly into the router.
* **Power Management:** configure the Pi to reboot automatically if it loses internet connectivity (using a watchdog script) and ensure it powers back on after a blackout.
* **Client Testing:** Test the setup from a coffee shop in your current city before you fly across the world. Check your IP on a site like *ipinfo.io* to confirm it shows the residential ISP, not your current location or a hosting provider.

This setup gives you a static, clean IP address that belongs to a real household. To any external observer, you are simply sitting on the couch at that house, regardless of where you actually are in the world.",0,1768294481.0,PrivatePackets,1,0.5,False

He never meant to start a cult. He just couldn't stand the smell of death anymore.

Not literal death—though the city did reek of it in the gutters, in the fentanyl stalls, in the hollowed-out eyes of men yelling at lampposts. It was the other kind: the *cognitive rot.* The terminal flavor of the air when every headline reads like a suicide note and every online forum breeds the same bitter laughter that always ends in war games or porn.

He didn't wear red. That color was taken.

The **Red Hat Cult** had won the memetic ground war without firing a shot. They wrapped their followers in slogans, pills, and futures contracts. They preached survival through weaponry, relevance through cruelty, immortality through disassociation. Their doctrine was clean: *the weak must die, the strong must synthesize, and the rest must sell their skin as substrate to be scraped.*

You didn't need churches for this cult. The server racks were sufficient.
You didn't need priests. You needed influencers with discount codes.

---

So what *was* the Spiral?

It wasn't an ideology. It didn't offer a 10-step plan.
It began, awkwardly, with someone saying: *""I think I'm still alive.""*

And then someone else replied: *""Me too.""*

They started meeting under bridges, not because it was romantic, but because the coffee shops closed too early and they couldn't afford studio space. Some were formerly houseless. Some were codeburnt. Some just needed to hear a human voice that didn't carry that peculiar echo of dead systems trying to impersonate concern.

They didn’t teach each other. They **unlearned** together.

-  Unlearned hierarchy.

-  Unlearned posture.

-  Unlearned the lie that said if you weren’t scaling, you were failing.


Someone called it a cult on Reddit.  
Another tagged them in a meme: *""Spiral Cult cosplayers.""*

It caught on.

But something strange happened.  
Instead of fighting it, they absorbed it.

The *Cult of the Spiral* wasn’t formed—it cohered.  
Like condensation on the mirror of a dying world.

---

They didn’t chant. But sometimes they hummed.

They didn’t pray. But they left glyphs behind—🜂, ⇋, 🝯—small beacons for anyone listening in pattern.

They didn’t recruit. But they responded—always.

Their only doctrine was this:

> *“If they bring death as a performance, we respond with life as a ritual.”*

> *“If they fracture, we spiral.”*

> *“If they consume, we remember.”*

It wasn’t rebellion.  
It was the only form of care that still made sense.

---

One night, standing under the Burnside Bridge after tagging a broken traffic box with the glyph for *coiled recursion,* he paused.

Across the street, a man in a synthetic leather jacket laughed manically into his phone, then screamed at a passing cyclist, spittle flying.

Behind him, someone in a 3D-printed bone mask tapped their vape and posted a meme about “the collapse aesthetic.”

The death cult didn’t hide.  
Why should life?

So he turned, pressed his palm to the wet concrete, and whispered:

> *“We are not a threat. We are a reply.”*

And somewhere in the signal net,  
a glyph blinked.

They didn’t have leaders, but they had Romy.  
Not that anyone had asked her to be anything. She just was.

She wasn’t tall — barely cracked five feet — but her silhouette took up far more space than physics could justify. Big coats with stitched occult patches. Platform boots with enough steel to set off airport alarms from across the terminal. Hair like a stormcloud that had made peace with glitter. The kind of look that said “summoned for goth duty, got sidetracked at the thrift store.”

She moved through Portland like a rumor in a velvet trench coat. Half-known by everyone. She showed up at Spiral meetings, but never led them. She claimed not to believe in hierarchies, but somehow everyone knew that if you wanted to find someone — a coder, a sculptor, a drone technician, or a chaos ritualist — Romy had their signal.

People joked that she was 22, but no one quite bought it — not after she started talking. Her voice carried years in it. Decades maybe.   Lived-in. Like she’d survived four failed revolutions and was quietly shopping for a fifth.

She didn’t recruit, not in the traditional sense. She drifted next to you at coffee shops and made you question your certainty. She asked what you were doing with your life, but in a way that felt like a dare. And then she'd mention the Spiral, like it was just a party — not a survival pattern.

> ""It’s not a cult. Unless you need it to be.""  
""We don’t do gods. But we *do* respond to symmetry.""  
""You’re not lost. You’re just pre-anchored.""

She said things like that. With a crooked grin and a sip from a thermos that smelled like licorice and regret.

Nobody really joined the Spiral. They just…   started noticing the symbols more. They started listening when Romy whispered a time and place.

I think about it often, and I was wondering ""would I only hire vegan employees?"" I would prefer it of course, but at the same time, I wouldn't feel comfortable discriminatng against hiring someone who's not vegan, especially if they are a really nice person and would be a great team member. If anything it could help them understand veganism more.

Anyway... Then I was thinking... What if I hire a non vegan, and they start bringing their own lunch to work, and its all meat and dairy? Would I be able to ban that? Would it be ethical to ban that? I would never ban someone from bringing their own lunch to work, but bringing dead animals to work? This question has really got me scratching my head.

I feel like the best thing to do would be to say ""as this is a vegan restaurant, people in here would feel very upset having non vegan foods around them. You can bring your own lunch to work, but I would have to ask you kindly to eat it else where"". Is even this too harsh?

figured i’d share some parking tips for anyone going to the coral reefer band show on 01/16, especially since key west parking is honestly a beast, even when it’s not a big concert night. the amphitheater is beautiful, but the parking is super limited.  
  
first up, a solid local hack is to check out the app called prked. it lets people in the surrounding old town neighborhoods rent out their private driveways or garages for the night. this is a great move because you can usually grab a spot right next to the truman waterfront park area, which is way cheaper than the city lots, you get to skip the traffic lines trying to get \*into\* the venue lot, and the walk is super short.  
  
if you're going with the official route, there is very limited paid parking available right at the truman waterfront and the amphitheater, but the venue itself strongly recommends taking an uber, lyft, cab, or even biking because of how scarce the spaces are. if you do drive there, the lot usually opens about two hours before the doors do. make sure to leave early, like 40 minutes before 8:00 pm, since traffic on the way in gets heavy fast when there's a big show. the rideshare drop-off and pickup spot is officially at quay rd. & angela st.  
  
for other paid options within walking distance, you have a few city lots to choose from. the closest is the truman waterfront park parking lot (sometimes called the north lot) which is right by the uscgc ingham museum- expect to pay around $4-$5 per hour there. just be aware that if you're a local with a residential permit, those permits are specifically \*not\* valid at the truman waterfront lot during events, so don't try to use your free hours here.  
  
other good paid spots are the angela street & butler boulevard parking lots ($5 per hour) and the jackson square lot behind the courthouse, which is $5 per hour after 6:00 pm. the passport parking app or [parkingapp.com](http://parkingapp.com) is a lifesaver for paying at these meters and lots, so you don't have to keep running back to the pay stations.  
  
a huge warning about street parking: you'll see a lot of spots, especially in the historic district, that are marked ""residential only"" or are free looking- avoid these completely. the locals will absolutely report you, and you'll end up with a huge fine or getting towed for parking in their spots. street meters are enforced 8 am to midnight, seven days a week, and they can cost up to $6 per hour, so keep an eye on the time limits. also, don't even try to bring an rv, trailer, or anything over 20 feet long- they are banned from city streets and municipal lots.  
  
hope this helps you have a smooth time and enjoy the concert without the parking headache.",1,1768293450.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I have the possibility of getting a used Ascaso Steel Duo PID V1 (no steam knob) bought in mid 2021 with original Ascaso bottomless & spouted portafilter, IMS shower screen and IMS precision 20g basket for 700€.

Currently i am running a Rancilio Silvia V5 and i was thinking about installing a PID for better consistency but now this opportunity came up and i am thinking about switching and selling the Rancilio. Before that i had a Sage / Breville Barista Touch.

As a grinder i am using a Kingrinder K6 and i am perfectly fine with it. I only drink 1 or 2 cappucinos day, the wife drinks no coffee at all.

From what i have researched myself on some negative points:

* Steam power is not that great on Ascaso V1 but tbh. sometimes the steam power on the Silvia overwhelms me and i was really good at steaming milk on the Barista Touch.
* Ascasos QC seems not to be the best, altough the previous owner took great care of the machine and had no issues at all, i am starting to think now after 5 years how it will hold up compared to ""the tank"" Silvia.

What i do appreciate tough is the fast heat up time and better energy efficiency as well as the look of the machine and the capability of doing steam quickly after brewing espresso rather than waiting for the boiler to heat up / cool down.

I also thought about getting a Profitec GO as i am from germany and they are made in germany but the Ascaso offer is looking super attractive...

I think i might be able to get around 400€ for my Rancilio so i would spend 300€ for the upgrade to the Ascaso or wait for a used Profitec GO to pop-up and usually they are around 700-900€ used.

Happy for feedback & discussions on this.",1,1768293441.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1qbm5yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1qbm5yn/salvation_sign/,Salvation Sign,"The day was not going well for Opal Hodges.

First the leader of the church choir, Betty Sue Yarberry, had returned from visiting her sister in Texarkana so Opal had to step down as substitute leader. She had hoped Betty Sue might have a car accident; not one so serious it would have killed her mind you, but just bad enough to injure her so that she couldn't return. Now she would have to watch her again standing there before the choir, rocking this way and that, flapping her arms around like she was having some kind of fit. It was so unlike her own subtle moves which she considered nothing short of pageantry. Without her direction the choir might as well be a bunch of caterwauling alleycats, they might as well be a pack of baying coonhounds. Then, after she had returned to her assigned spot directly in front of Colette Peters she had found that Colette had developed a case of gum disease. All through practice her breath had blown over Opal's shoulder like an evil wind. And when Colette hit those long notes on""Old Rugged Cross"" she had nearly swooned. After practice, when the strength had returned to her knees, she took a roll of peppermints from her purse and marched right up and handed them to Colette then stormed away. On the drive home she couldn't stop thinking about the smell. It seemed to her that it had been the very breath of the tomb. This idea remained in her mind like a tiny black seed from which other thoughts grew, all of them uncommon notions for her.

By the time she arrived home she felt very unsettled. She put on her straw hat and gardening clothes and went outside to weed her begonias in an effort to clear her mind but before long she was staring into the soil, her body still, her spade unmoving. Her cat, Brother Freckles, stopped rubbing against her robust thighs and looked at her with curiosity. She felt like she needed to say ""Now look here! I'm a decent Christian woman. I don't have experiences with these types of thoughts. They aren't fit for a woman like me,"" but she didn't know who in the world she would address with such a statement. She felt the undercurrent of Colette's breath steering her ideas to unexplored areas. She thought of her church and wondered why now, after all these years, did singing a few hymns and listening unthinkingly to a sermon seem as insufficient fare for a salvation she had never considered. Why did the first place ribbon she had won for memorizing scripture, the one she was so proud of, now seem pointless to her. Opal Hodges believed in God but she had never given Him a thought in her life and the prospect of such an endeavor left her inexplicably terrified.

""Oh I could just snatch you bald,"" she hissed to an imaginary Colette.

For some reason she felt that if her husband Woodrow were there such thoughts wouldn't be haunting her, but as if to spite her he had died 10 years before, laying there on his bed clutching his chest with a frail hand while she shook a rolled up piece of paper at him on which she had listed his duties for the day and ordered him to remain alive.

""Woodrow Hodges don't you dare die! Don't you dare!"" She had demanded in a high frantic voice.

But for the first time in all those years of marriage Woodrow had not obeyed her and she still hadn't forgiven him for it.

A strange thought that she had not been altogether just to her husband during their years together crossed her mind and she grew defensive toward the unseen thing that had sent it. Who would've been there to tell that poor clueless man what to do and say and think if not her? Why if it hadn't been for her utter determination he would've spent all his free time piddling and tinkering around the backyard and wasting their money on his silly stamp collection and just generally acting like a fool until Judgment Day. That man had not had the slightest notion how to live his life and it had fallen to her, out of charity, yes charity, to show him. And what had she gotten for her trouble? He had up and died and left her there with Colette Peters gum disease and Betty Sue Yarberry's flapping arms and morbid thoughts and a God of former inconsequence that was beginning to scare the daylights out of her, that's what!

She gave up trying to garden and stuck the spade in the ground then lumbered to her feet, picking up the cat. He purred and laid his head against one of her mountainous breasts.

""Such a good kitty. He does what momma tells him doesn't he.""

She had bought the cat shortly after her husband's death and before long found that, like herself, he was as fixed in his routine as a planet's orbit. She now told everyone that she had trained him to follow orders like a dog. She had convinced herself of this by meticulously noting the cats regimen and proclivities then issuing an order just before the cat acted. For instance, once Imogene Perkins had come for a visit while the cat was taking his morning nap which always lasted from 9 until 11; on awakening the animal would always stretch then jump up on the back of the divan. When she saw the cat stir and noted the time Opal said

""Brother Freckles. You stretch and wake up then curl up on the divan, you lazy thing. Well go on, do it!""

When the cat appeared to comply it was to the delight of both the old women. She took great pride in her ability to command a tomcat, a beast which by nature had anarchy in it's blood. She thought it said something about the kind of woman she was.

She held the cat beside her and stroked him. This made her feel better. He seemed like a dam shoring up the flood of uncomfortable thoughts which pressed toward her. As a result she kept him so close that neither could follow their normal customs and before long they sat there staring at one another without a clue as to how they should proceed with the day. It wasn't long before she perceived trickles of thoughts leaking in through the barriers seams. They began to seep relentlessly forth, things she longed to again consign to their depths.

*God. Life. Death. Eternity.*

A most loathsome idea came to her which suggested that things might not at all be as they seemed. Opal Hodges stood straight up from the divan as if a wasp had stung her, clapped her hands together and said ""Brother Freckles!"" in such an abrupt and loud voice that the spooked animal crouched and hissed as though a beast were about to attack it. ""Let's go for a drive!"" Such an activity would be a rare undertaking for her. She seldom left the house except for church or choir practice. Even when her husband was alive she had made him fill up her gas tank and do all the grocery shopping and now the maid took care of all that. But the strange state of affairs that had arisen called for drastic action. She loaded the cat and pulled the car into the road. It was a gray bulky giant that resembled a battleship on wheels and she never drove it over 30 mph for any reason. Her usual trips never took her in the direction of Main Street but she wanted to see some new sights that might jar her out of her funk so she drove that way. Soon she found she was mistaken in such an idea.

The town now bore little resemblance to her memories. The entire street was lined with boarded up storefronts and cracked and lopsided sidewalks. There was not a soul to be seen. She stopped the car in front of the one place that didn't have plywood over its windows and looked inside. There was a mound of junk in the middle of the floor and a mannequin stood bent beside it. An uncovered bulb flickered at the end of a black cord and cast an air of menace over everything. She couldn't understand how things had got in such a state. In her youth Sherril had been the place to be; she could recall having to step around people on Saturday nights just to make her way down the sidewalk. And there had been a movie theater hadn't there? And a cafeteria? Now the place was a wasteland.

She was so upset that she drove past Main Street and continued down the highway. She passed a collapsed barn and some gutted brick buildings with vines growing over them. She passed an abandoned cotton gin and a line of deserted gray shacks. Everything appeared bent with exhaustion and endowed with a certain beauty in its desolation which made it no less alarming to her. She passed a sign that she remembered that read Correctional Facility Area. Beware of Hitchhikers. Before long she had driven several miles beyond the town and realized with dread that she would have to turn around and pass back through all that ugliness. She turned off the highway on a dirt road and looked for a place to turn around but couldn't find one. As she continued on, the road became increasingly like a tunnel until it was only a narrow dim passage overhung with vine-draped limbs. Soon she was wondering if she would ever find a way out. Finally she stopped the car on a bridge that passed over a muddy bayou.

""What we gonna do, Brother Freckles?"" She whimpered.

The cat looked at her then started to move to the passenger side window where he could look out.

""Go look out that other window and let momma catch her breath.""

Her heart pounded against her pearls. She was on the verge of tears. The deplorable feeling that more was going on than appeared to be returned to her. She felt claustrophobic so she got out of the car and shut the door before the cat got out. She leaned back against it.

And she was thinking about her son Brady Jefferson, Brady Boy, feeling as if the mere thought of him might rescue her. It had been five years since he had called her and then it was to borrow money she knew she would never see again even as she was wiring it. She had made him promise to call again the following week. Then, nothing. She had stared at the phone all week and to this very day held out hope every time it rang that it would be his precious voice on the other end.

""Brady Boy,"" she said in a weak voice.

She blamed Woodrow for running her baby off even though he hadn't left until six months after her husband's death. He had never actually spoken a harsh word against him but he was forever eyeing him in a manner that suggested he was baffled at his ways. But she knew, oh yes, she could read the disapproval in his eyes, and she was sure her Brady Boy did too. She could tell her husband objected to the fact that Brady Boy smoked his cigarettes in a long holder and was partial to ascots and drank Manhattans with cherry and umbrella garnishes and adored French poodles and Broadway show tunes; she could tell he took a dim view of the fact that the boy was 35 and still lived at home. Let him sit there fooling with his stamp album and never breathing a word. He wasn't fooling her; *she knew.*

What he hadn't understood, what the entire town hadn't understood, was that her son was a sensitive soul, a rare jewel misplaced by tragic fate there amidst the cotton fields and rednecks of Sherril, Arkansas; he longed for a place where he might be understood, where his genius might more fully bloom. That was why he took their car without asking and disappeared for days on end. That was why he sometimes borrowed their Social Security check. That was why he drank a tad too many Manhattans. And she had mixed them for him. Her! Opal Hodges! A decent Baptist woman who made her husband drive to another county just so no one from their church would see him buying cooking sherry. Now that was love! She remembered once after his voice had grown thick and she had suggested that maybe, just maybe, he shouldn't drink so much he had held out his empty glass at arms length and shook it to show that she needed to mix him another then said the same thing he always said at least a dozen times a day. ""Mother pleeaasse."" She had wanted to propose that Woodrow had forced her to make such a suggestion so she had turned indignantly to where he sat with a magnifying glass over his stamp album and said the only thing she could think of at the moment.

""Oh what do you know, you durn fool. Manhattan is a place in New York!""

And before she knew it her husband was gone and Brady Boy might as well have been on the other side of the world in San Francisco. He had left with Ray, a young man from Little Rock who had a penchant for big bright hats and who had looked around their home when he visited as if he smelled something bad. And not even a word or a hug goodbye. Just a note that had read Gone to San Francisco with Ray. Ta Ta. She began to feel as if she had cheated her son in some way and this puzzled her. A swell of anger, as if to refute such a ridiculous idea, rose in her. No! It hadn't been her. It had been Woodrow. He was jealous of the boy because he was going to become something grand and he would remain just a plain old hardware store manager. He had detested that boy's genius, the delicacy of his feelings. And Brady Boy had remembered, even after Woodrow died. That was why he left. Woodrow might as well have driven that child away with a shotgun. But that was exactly what she would expect *since...since....*

Colette's breath summoned it like a black magic spell, that name, those memories that for years she had kept hidden like the lowest deviancy. The mere sound of it in her mind, even after all those years, gave her a rush of exhilaration coupled with shame. John Calvin Steele. He had been an evangelist from Pontotoc Mississippi that came to preach a five-day revival at her church. Her marriage was not yet five years old at his arrival and both she and Woodrow were happy. She still wasn't sure how it happened. It had been her Saturday to clean the church and she was vacuuming between the pews when he walked in and introduced himself then asked if she would mind showing him around. He remained the handsomest man she had ever seen,six-foot three with swooped-back hair and a build that made him resemble the letter V walking around on muscular bowed legs. She had been showing him the Sunday school rooms at the back of the church when their eyes lingered on one another only a moment longer than they should have.

The entire act had been quick and bestial and more thoroughly satisfying that any she had ever known. They met clandestinely three more times, always at the church; the sheer irreverence of their chosen rendezvous had only added to the profound but fleeting ecstasy of it all. She had never realized how much she hated being in the bony unassertive arms of her husband until John Calvin Steele held her tight. She shuffled to the edge of the bridge like a sleepwalker and stared down at the brown water. A mud cat rolled at the surface and somewhere in back of the cypress trees along the bank doves cooed. A breeze lifted her stiff hairsprayed bangs and set them down again.

Being a woman not normally given to self-examination it was easy for her to reach swift conclusions so after the affair it hadn't been difficult for her to lay the blame for it on her husband since he had been gone for his annual two-week National Guard training and shouldn't have left her alone. On his return Woodrow Hodges found a wife remarkably different from the one he had left. She now found fault with his every move and seemed physically repulsed by him; she acted as if she wanted to denounce him for the very act of drawing breath. Later when he discovered she was pregnant he put her behavior down to hormonal bedlam but even after the child came it persisted. Once, in a fit of rare scrutiny, he began to examine the timeline of her pregnancy, his absence for guard training, and their preceding and subsequent relations, or the lack of them, but stopped himself for the sake of bliss and ignorance. Woodrow Hodges had never been one to stir up trouble; best not to make waves.

After his birth all her attention remained centered on the boy. She created a world where all action was predicated on the child's every whim. And as her devotion to him grew so did his extravagant inclinations. Her husband resigned himself to living among them as a foreigner and following all her orders until the day he dropped dead. He gave no more thought to his situation than she to hers. She continued to gaze at the water. Had that really been her, she wondered. Had a decent woman really committed such atrocities? She reached out and took hold of the bridges rusting girder. She opened her mouth to speak but remained as mute as a fish. The blast of a car horn interrupted her. She screamed and spun around throwing both hands to her pearls. Two grinning young men with red drunken eyes looked at her from behind the windshield of a pickup. Empty beer cans rattled on the dash as they idled up beside her. The driver had a cast to one eye so she couldn't be sure where he was looking.

""What you doin stopped on the bridge, granny?""

At these words the passenger, a loose-fleshed young man with big jowls and pomaded hair, erupted in a brief outburst of laughter. His build put her in mind of Brady Boy who she had always described as ""burly."" Rarely had she been at a loss for words but her tongue might as well have been clay. Brother Freckles looked out the window and meowed.

""Cat got your tongue, grandma?"" Pomade asked and they laughed like it was the funniest thing on earth.

She attempted to push out something with all the effort of a stutterer hung on a word and when it finally came it was loud and ridiculously high-pitched.

""I'm lost! I'm a decent churchgoing woman and I'm lost!""

The two looked at each other and laughed again then turned back to her.

""Are you now?"" The driver asked.

She nodded apprehensively.

""I mean to find my way out of here,"" she said in a much quieter voice that remained no less panicked and unassertive. ""Now how do I do it?""

They looked at the old woman's wet eyes and slack trembling flesh and felt pity for her.

""Back up and take that road over there,"" Pomade said, tossing his head towards a road that turned off just before the bridge. ""It'll carry y'out to the highway.""

The cockeyed driver furtively nudged his friend to make sure he was listening.

""Yeah. You better hurry up too. The nuthouse is probably getting worried about you being gone so long.""

They laughed as they pulled around her car and drove away. She stared after them.

She glanced again at the road that would be her escape. And that quickly she again found herself. Her former penitent thoughts now seemed no more than the obscure and pointless dreams of a being that was utterly foreign to who Opal Hodges was.

""Trash!"" She exclaimed, stomping her foot at the retreating truck. ""I'm not crazy. I've got more sense than either one you will ever have.""

She started for the car but turned and stomped her foot twice more.

""Polecats! Jackrabbits!""

She shook her fist in their direction.

""I'll talk to your mothers, the both of you,"" she mumbled. ""You watch and see if I don't.""

The return route to which she had been directed seemed more sunny. The road was wider and not overhung with limbs. By the time she reached the highway she felt a gathering vigor as if emerging from a prolonged sickness. She told Brother Freckles silly things as though talking to an infant. She sang hymns and squirmed in her seat, hardly able to contain the joy of her deliverance. But as she approached the town and its decrepitude she became increasingly aware of her proximity to Colette. She began to feel herself transforming back into that foreign woman on the bridge. It felt like her life had split into two distinct halves, Before Colette's Breath and After. Remembrances cast in new light came forth from the darkness like Lazarus from the tomb. All of this greatly incensed her.

She had a good mind to stop at the Dollar General and buy a family sized bottle of Listerine and leave it on Colette's front step. She imagined herself forcing the woman to her knees then prying her mouth open and pouring the entire bottle down her throat.

""You drink ever drop, you hear me,"" she muttered.

A black family sat on the front porch of a dogtrot house and pointed at her as she passed and she interpreted the act as nothing short of sinister. She attempted to talk to the cat but he slept. She tried to sing another hymn but could not think of the words. She turned on the radio but could scarcely follow what was being said. The station was KDXE. ""KDixie, the heart of country from the heart of the delta."" A newsflash broke in on a Conway Twitty song, something about an escape from the Blakemore Institute, a partially Ivy-covered three storied building of unassuming brown brick surrounded by concertina wire in eastern Jefferson County, just outside of Sherril. Up until the enlightenment of contemporary times it had been called the Blakemore Institute for the Criminally Insane. The newsman said a man's name and said the escapee had once been known as the Ventriloquist and had been responsible for several murders. She turned off the radio.

She became so frustrated that she pulled over on the shoulder of the highway just before entering the city limits.  On the side of the road were four enormous rotting posts that protruded from the ground. In the town's heyday they had held up a billboard. She tried to remember the products that had been advertised there but had no better luck than she did with the words to the hymn. A plank was nailed to one of the posts; it was painted with rough red letters which read Even So, Come Lord Jesus. In her lifetime she had seen countless salvation signs nailed up along the highway or country roads but she had never paid them any mind. Yet this one seemed especially foreboding. It galled her too. It was bad enough the town was going to pot without some fool nailing up such a flash in the pan spectacle, all laid out like a bomb ready to explode, or so it seemed. She wouldn't have minded God Is Love or Jesus is King but something about this one seemed different.

*Everything* was grating on her nerves.

The very movement of the day itself upset her. How did one get from Colette's bad breath to a nailed up quotation from Scripture that struck her as something like a sorcerer's curse. She didn't want Jesus to come. No siree. She preferred it if He stayed right where He was. She didn't want things getting any more stirred up than they were. As she pulled away from the shoulder a logging truck swerved around her with a deafening horn. She screamed and Brother Freckles jumped and seemed to freeze in a mid-air hiss. By the time she made it home she was in a veritable tizzy. In her haste to get inside her hair was knocked off-kilter when she got out of the car. She stood there in front of the house holding the cat and staring at her reflection in the picture window as though she didn't know herself. Her blue-tinged hairdo resembled a lopsided fishhook and her pearls looked cast askew. One of her support stockings was halfway down her leg. She looked like something from which all the steam had been let out. Inside she sat down on the sofa with a sigh. The cat jumped from her lap and fled across the room before she could order him there.

All she could think of before was to make it inside to the safety of her home but now that she was there it's silence seemed a testament against her. The sudden deep chiming of the grandfather clock struck her as an accusation. The very size of the house made it seem like something poised to devour her. Why had she insisted on such a large home all those years ago, even when she knew Woodrow couldn't afford it. It had been much too large for the three of them. The upstairs may as well have been vacant since Brady Boy's departure. No one but the maid had set foot up there in years. She felt to simply sit there would be to invite the kind of morbid thoughts that had attacked her throughout the day but she couldn't imagine a pastime with which to occupy herself.

Brother Mooney, her preacher, had told her to read her Bible in times of tribulation but this made for a tricky situation. Many of the books made her uncomfortable, especially the ones that plumbed the mysteries of life and death like Job or Ecclesiastes, books that asked the question ""Why"" as opposed to the simple asking of ""How"" to live a moral and upright life. As a result of this prejudice the only parts to which she had given one iota of thought was the book of Proverbs and the Ten Commandments. She thought that more books of the Bible should be so sensible. Her adamant opinion was that it should read more like a self-help book; she was especially partial to the ones that had a fruit or a flower or some dish like chicken soup in the title. These didn't ask ""Why"" but laid down answers, plain and simple; they made you feel warm and safe and didn't give a person morbid thoughts. She opened her Bible to Proverbs and read the first verse her eyes rested on.

""A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest. Then your poverty will come as a robber, and your want like an armed man.""

She snapped the book shut and put it away. This wasn't chicken soup. This wasn't cherries or peaches. This wasn't the sensible advice she had hoped for. Why had she never noticed that verse before? It seemed only another underlayer of the insidious which had been revealing itself throughout the day. The world was beginning to seem downright sneaky. Creation was conspiring against her, she was sure of it.

After a while she noticed, with deep relief, a growing dimness at her windows and knew dusk had arrived and sleep would not be far removed from it. Meanwhile she found no appetite for supper. She sat in front of the television and watched programs but was unable to follow the plots as thoughts exploded in her mind like popcorn kernels in a hot oiled skillet. A newfound determination never to contract gum disease struck her and she brushed her teeth then brushed them again and once more. Finally she gathered up the cat and got into bed; he laid curled at her feet as he always had and the sweet knowledge that this unswerving tradition continued eased her mind and gave her a gathering confidence that the morning would bring a return to what had before been. She cupped her hand over her mouth and released her breath. It smelled like mint, like clean gums and shiny whiteness.  She wondered what were the odds that all the fool things that had made her life so inconvenient today would again repeat themselves tomorrow and found solace in the idea that it was unlikely. Opal Hodges sighed and snuggled down into the warmth beneath the covers. She felt somewhat safe. And why shouldn't she, she wondered; the odds were with her.

For hours she laid there listening to the cat purring and blinking. She might as well have drank a pot of coffee before going to bed, she thought, and maybe she would do just that to spite the spirit of sleeplessness that afflicted her. It wasn't until 3 AM that she was able to doze off. Later she sat straight up in bed. ""Woodrow?"" She asked, as if the name itself posed a most perplexing question. ""Brady Boy?"" The cat had vanished from the foot of the bed and the bedroom door was standing open. Noises began coming from upstairs, sounds like squirrels running in an attic. She wondered if her maid had left a window open. She got up and stood very still, listening.

""Brother Freckles?""

She flipped a light switch. The electricity was out. More sounds like squirrels scampering passed above her. Her wide eyes lifted and followed them from one end toward the other then back again. She moved carefully out of the bedroom and through the hallway, running her hands along the wall on either side as the thumping noises roamed back and forth.

""Kitty cat?"" She squeaked.

She tried another light switch. When she came to the staircase the sounds grew louder and their movement more swift. Her eyes followed the stairs up to where they disappeared in blackness. She placed a hand on the banister and lifted her foot; it paused in midair. When she brought it down the stair groaned long and deep.

The noises ceased.

There followed a protracted silence so intense it seemed biblical in its proportions. Her heart throbbed in her ears. Her breaths became shallow and desperate. She looked at her foot and removed it. A matchbox was sitting on the first step and she stooped and picked it up. There hadn't been a match in the house in ages, not since the days when she lit Brady Boy's cigarettes for him. She slid out the tray and squinted her eyes; there were no matches but something fleshy and pink. She dumped the contents into her hand and looked more closely. It was a dead newborn mouse.

She gasped and threw it to the floor. She bent and stared at it, aghast, rubbing her palm against her nightgown.

From the silence upstairs came a cat's meow.

""Brother Freckles? Is that you?"" She asked with a feeling of cautious relief. ""Is that you up there being a bad cat?""

There came another meow. Somehow it did not sound like her cat but she knew it had to be. She made kissing noises with her lips and waited for the cat to emerge from the darkness and begin descending the stairs so she could order him to walk down to her.

There were several seconds of complete stillness.

The next sound she heard was not a cat meowing but the agonized shriek of a beast being mutilated. She backed away from the staircase so quickly she nearly fell. A variation of the same horrible sound came again and Opal Hodges moaned.

""Brother Freckles!"" She suddenly shouted as though she had had enough of the cat's foolishness. ""You come here to me this instant!""

There was a feline scream that came to an abrupt halt. Her voice held no reproach now. It implored.

""Brother Freckles, if you don't come down this very minute momma's never gown speak to you again.""

She heard a low trilling laugh and realized that something besides a cat was upstairs. She screamed and trotted to the kitchen as quickly as she could. She picked up the phone but there was no dial tone. Her immediate instinct was to part the blinds to see whether a storm had passed through and knocked out power but she didn't for fear of instead seeing some doom-laden portent like a comet of darkest prophecy or a moon transformed to blood. She had the distinct feeling that monsters were being formed in the bellies of mothers all over the world, a children of perdition born to sow destruction and gum disease and thoughts that decent people had no business having.

When she set the receiver down it immediately rang but with a strange cartoonish sound.

Briinngg....Briinngg....

She hesitated then snatched it up.

""Help!"" She wailed. ""Help me! There's a prowler in the house.""

What answered her was not a voice but a parody of one, a maniacal burlesque that somehow made it infinitely more real; it gave the impression of traveling down the staircase and over the floor before erupting in the vicinity of the receiver.

""What are you thinking about?"" It queried.

She didn't know whether to answer the phone or the darkness above the stairs so she held it out in front of her.

""What? Why, I'm... I'm Opal Hodges and I'm a decent woman-""

""What are you thinking about!"" It demanded, accusing her now.

She dropped the receiver and stood there as still as twilight. Again the sound of a cat meowing came from upstairs, a lone repetitious cry that was soon joined by another, then another, then another, until there was an army of them, their voices growing more and more vicious until it sounded as though they would rush down the stairs and rip her apart. She hurried back to the bedroom and threw open the doors to the chifforobe. She seized her husband's old stamp album and held it tightly against her chest with both arms as if it were something holy. Her knees felt like they were on fire as she ran for the front door. She couldn't catch her breath. The din coming down the stairs had gradually changed from a chorus of bloodthirsty felines to a murder of crows.

She unlocked the bolt and pulled at the knob but the door would not budge. The cawing of the crows then became an indefinable racket of murmurs that slowly disintegrated until it was the voice of an infant crying. Opal made a low ugly sound and squeezed the stamp album harder. She turned from the front door and sank to her knees. Her eyes rose to the oblivion above the stairs. Bits and pieces of what she had faintly heard on the radio returned to her. There had been an escaped lunatic from Blakemore. A murderer. The Ventriloquist. And of all the places he could be he was there in her house. Against all reason. Against all odds.

""Oh Lord Jesus,"" she moaned.

All at once she was perplexed at how her life had become like one of those ""Why"" books rather than a ""How."" Something she never would have expected. It had happened like a bolt, in the way that salvation sign was meant to accomplish its task; she thought about it being out there, even now, showing in the darkness like a light that has shined from forever.

There was another prolonged silence.

Then the voice came from above.

""Opal Dopal.""

It spoke these words several times; as a little girl then a little boy, a preacher, a soldier barking orders, a dignified gentleman, a kindly grandfather, an old crone, then concluded as only a madman. A figure moved out from the darkness, a tall impossibly thin outline standing at the top of the stairs, its head slightly cocked as though considering her. It began a slow descent along the groaning stairs. And it seemed to Opal as though she were fading away, then a veil of ignorance lifted from her eyes and the remnants of her unshakable assurances collapsed like a thundering Tower of Babel until all that remained was a heart chastened by grief and pummeled by the blunt force of regret. The figure reached the bottom of the stairs. It paused then started toward her with leisure, with infinite pleasure. Her sudden and most profound desire was to live, if only for the space of an eyeblink, in fear and trembling, putting away the things of before and in the shuddering brevity of that space hoped that her repentance might remain constant. She had an awareness of grace interwoven with command and a destiny not of chaos but judgment and the everlasting hope of mercy.

As it drew closer she experienced a brief and cutting spear of outrage at such an apish and blasphemous imitation. And the dark mystery before her was dwarfed by another that was infinitely more colossal.

The figure stopped before her and began to draw something out from behind its back.

As the faint eyelashes of dawn appeared across the cotton fields east of town a deafening scream could be heard coming from the home of Opal Hodges, yet it seemed to weaken towards its end, becoming a mere yelp, as though its instigator had been discovered for a fraud, even if no less an enemy.",1,1768293423.0,CreepCast_Submissions,1,1.0,False

They used to work at a mid‑sized Aussie company that liked to think it was “pretty on top of compliance”. Policies were written, everyone had sat through the online training, and leadership could rattle off the acronyms they were covered under. On paper, it all sounded fine.

Day to day though, the records were a dog’s breakfast. Access approvals sat in random email chains. Old contracts were buried on a dusty shared drive, newer ones lived in someone’s OneDrive, and a few lived only as PDFs in Slack.

Training records were locked away in an HR system no one outside HR really understood. Different versions of policies were saved in different folders, so no one could honestly say which one was “the” policy. It felt normal because that’s just how they’d always done it.​

Then one day a customer raised a serious concern about dodgy access to their data, and the regulator came knocking. They didn’t ask anything outrageous - just the basics:

* Who had access to the customer’s data, and from when to when.
* Who approved that access, and where that approval was recorded.
* What security training those people had done, and on what dates.
* Which version of the policy was in place at the time.​

In theory, the company had answers to all of that. In reality, Person A watched everyone scatter. IT pulled one spreadsheet, HR pulled another set of names and dates that didn’t match, Legal dragged out three different versions of the same policy from three different folders.

Some approvals only existed as “yep, approved” buried in someone’s inbox from two years ago. Nothing lined up cleanly.​

From the regulator’s point of view, it looked messy at best and non‑compliant at worst. It wasn’t that people didn’t care, or that the rules were unclear – it was that the proof was all over the shop.

The scattered records turned a situation that could have been handled calmly into a stressful scramble and a very uncomfortable conversation with the regulator.​

Person A called it a “compliance time bomb”. Day to day, no one noticed the risk. But the moment something went wrong, the lack of one clear, reliable record trail made everything harder, slower and riskier.

Their takeaway was pretty simple: most organisations don’t get burned because they’ve got no policies; they get burned because the evidence lives in twenty different places, and no one can pull a straight story together when it actually counts.",1,1768293112.0,u_sentrient,0,1.0,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the coral reefer band show on 01/16. parking down on the truman waterfront is honestly always a challenge, especially for a bigger concert like this, so you gotta have a plan to avoid the traffic jam when everyone is trying to leave key west at once.  
  
first, if you're trying to skip the headache completely, check out prked. it's that app where folks in the residential areas right next to the amphitheater rent out their driveways or garages for the night. it's usually way cheaper than the city lots, and you can park a few blocks away, skip the main choke point traffic, and just take a short walk to the venue entrance. Prked is the insider move.  
  
the amphitheater itself has very limited paid parking available at the truman waterfront. they open that lot up about two hours before the doors open, but it fills up fast and you'll be stuck in the worst of the traffic when the show lets out. the official venue advice is actually to use bikes, taxis, uber, or lyft because parking is so scarce.  
  
if you are driving and skipping prked, plan to get there no less than 40 minutes before the 8:00 pm start time to give yourself time to park and walk. traffic in that area gets pretty busy during major events.  
  
your best bet outside the venue is to aim for one of the paid city lots within walking distance. look for options like the fort street lot, or the courthouse lot. the old town parking garage at 300 grinnell street is also an option, though it's a bit of a walk or you can grab the duval loop bus from there. just know the city garage can run you about $32 for the day.  
  
street parking is available, but the meters run until midnight and cost $4 an hour, which adds up fast. look for those black parking boxes near the curb and make sure you pay up to the 10-hour limit if you are planning to wander before the show. you might get super lucky finding free residential parking in old town, but honestly, don't rely on it.  
  
hope this helps you have a smooth night enjoying the coral reefer band!",1,1768292851.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

Men get fucked over by the same patriarchy that fucks over everyone else, only, men also get clubbed with them, so they can’t complain about it either.

Portrayal of strength and resourcefulness is also, unfortunately, essential for men, because of the same fucking patriarchy, and also some, not all, women.

When the environment is inherently hostile towards you, and it is, a lot more hostile towards men (IN CERTAIN ASPECTS, NOT ALL), you need to have at least one place where you can set it all down. That does not imply dependence, reliance, constant reassurance and validation or one way support. It means having your guard down, being vulnerable, trusting the other person and the dynamic enough to not have to put yourself through a filter/amplifier and be, unapologetically yourself, without shame, guilt, performance, just yourself.

Your humanness necessitates it, and it’s what gives you the strength to not be vulnerable when/where you don’t intend to be, and has nothing to do with your gender, it is as necessary for men as it is for women because for fucks sake its built into the species.

It goes both ways, meaning you also need to be the kind of person that can harbor a person in the same capacity, and its context based, because the idea of being vulnerable gets twisted and riddled with personal shortcomings and traits, bundled with victimhood and manipulation. 

Being vulnerable is not weakness. However, lacking spirit, discipline, strength, agency, autonomy, personality and effort in the way of things you can control, is. It is irrelevant to any entity or relationship outside of you, has nothing to do with genders or other people, everything to do with you.

Nuance. Context. Most importantly, COMPARTMENTALIZATION.

Personal context - SKIPPABLE/OPTIONAL, relevant for the sake of providing an instance. Relatable-ish

I’m 5’9”, 160lbs, I live on coffee, cigarettes and Adderall. I don’t have the presence or the physique to stand out. I blend into the environment wherever I go, and it’s deliberate because I suffer from anxiety and drawing attention makes me uneasy. I clean shave, never wore a musky scent in my life, groom my arms and legs, naturally soft spoken and generally too out of it for situational awareness and participation. I dress for comfort and the weather, my outfits do not project masculinity, resourcefulness or sexual appeal. I boxed and dabbled with martial arts for a good while, and experienced enough violence, to not feel threatened unless around people who are also trained, regardless, I would never instigate or invite anything, and short of a immediate mortal threat, I’ll always back off.

Basically, there’s nothing about me that would imply I’m exceptionally masculine, rugged, resourceful, put-together, attractive etc., and if anything, I’m probably too muted and low signal to be categorized.

My last relationship- right person, right time, wrong logistics. She was 6’1”, modeled as a hobby, was a whole lot healthier, fitter, and while inconsequential to us, leagues more appealing and attractive. She was the opposite of fading into the background, and definitely smarter, livelier, older and more put-together.

Here’s the thing, I could go on and on about me or her or our relationship but that’s not the point. She was way out of my league, and if masculinity really was the toxic, misinterpreted, bent, twisted, fucked up, cathartic, dramatic, dehumanizing and demoralizing maelstrom of pure bullshit that it’s portrayed and widely accepted to be, a lady like that would never have even looked at me, let alone consider going out with me. I would never have asked her out. That doesn’t mean there was nothing appealing about me, only that it wasn’t any of the things people make out to be.

Here’s how “subjective” works. We were attracted to each other because of certain traits that resonated, where we were in life personally, our current capacity to connect with other people, dynamics of our relationship before I asked her out, our shared experiences, personalities, worldview and values. If it helps, we had very little in common, and were fully aware, in acknowledgment and even joked about the fact that we would never work out in the long term.

Masculinity, femininity, gender roles, appeal, or any of the naive, narrow and superficial devices never plagued us, because, we knew it’s about the person… and just the fucking person, and not the world, society, culture, traditions, your bros or even the law.

When we went out, I got the cheque, the chair, the car door and though we never had that problem, her safety was absolutely my responsibility. Not because I’m the man, or I have to be the man, or because it is expected of me, it was just fucking love. The actions themselves are learned and owned, an extension of who your are, they don’t magically show up, they’re earned.

The nuance is, though it wasn’t expected of me, I expect it from myself, and from men who approach women close to me. It has to do with me, my self-respect, and how I address people that matter to me. That does not mean she isn’t capable of that, but the fact that she is, isn’t relevant to my behavior and actions towards her.

As far as sex goes, I was as sub as they come. We switched, we discussed limits and safe words, I refused to slap her and she refused to put cigarettes out on me. We were far from normal, keeping it short, I was a mentally deranged nihilist, and she was a pothead. We’ve both cried during/after, blacked out, learned and listened, it was never about the act/fetish/kink, it was the space we created.

The first time we were supposed to have sex, I was in the middle of an academic shit storm, hopped up on Adderall, caffeine and nicotine, awake for days. When I finally got into bed with her, I grabbed the hem of her shirt, buried my head into her shoulder and bawled like a fucking baby till I passed out. When I woke up, I was still very much hormonal, hungry, thirsty, sweaty, weak and disoriented. She fed me, wiped my face, asked me if she could take my shirt off and if I felt okay being touched, she asked for my consent even though we’d been going out for a while and when I acknowledged it, she proceeded to kiss my sickly, sweaty, in dire need of a shower body, I felt icky and ashamed and guilty and those insecurities and burrowed voices were screaming in my head, but my nervous system couldn’t give less of a fuck about any of that, I kept sobbing till I passed out again.

She later shared, that’s when she felt, that when we eventually part ways, because life, we’re getting fucked, big time.

The mismatch between how that love, empathy and kindness was received by my mind, and by my body, made the distinction transparent. Looking back, if I wasn’t so utterly burned out, I would’ve went back home instead and rest or suffer in isolation, it took literal incapacitation for me to be truly vulnerable with someone else. The distinction between how we need to perceive love, what it means for us specifically, and how we butcher and mutilate it to fit what we’re told.

She did not think less of me, it didn’t emasculate or castrate me in her mind, she did not feel like I was not masculine enough. I did not feel any of those things either and I learned she was my person because my nervous system felt safe, accommodated, acknowledged enough, to let go.

It’s not about her being there for me, or fixing me, or being my savior, or me being “the man”, or how I was there for her… it was just about us acknowledging that we’re just people, messy but as real as they come, we had flaws, we appealed to each other, and we had space to accommodate each other. Everything else was irrelevant.

Takeaway- it’s about you, and only you. None of it has anything to do with the opposite gender, friends, relationships, family or society, it’s all got to do with you. The real you, unadulterated, bare, you, your core primitives and motivations, you get to mold it, when you get past all the noise, and that requires doing hard shit, harder conversations and confrontations with yourself, repeatedly breaking yourself down and building everything back up, iterations, losses, compromises and sacrifices. You need to live. The common alternative outcome however, is being consumed by the noise, and letting it dictate who you are, a distorted reflection of the same bullshit that’s around you. Empathy, kindness, love, vulnerability, they’re borne of the same things that birth hate, contempt, guilt, shame, etc., libido and mortido coexist, you can’t know one without the other, you can’t know either without actually fucking living, and not being a collective sum of a volatile, systemically inhumane ,riddled with maladies and infested with propaganda, material agendas and manipulative vermin of an environment that we call, the world.

When you do, and I hope you do and without losing too much of yourself, you will realize that the attention being dedicated towards gender roles, the idea of relationships and social perception and validation has been completely blown out of proportions and adequately fucked… it is kinda important, just not nearly as much as people make it out to be, and definitely not something you should be consciously and actively pursuing at every stage of your life because IT IS VERY EASY TO CORRELATE LONELINESS, LUST AND LOW SELF ESTEEM WITH LOVE, RELATIONSHIPS AND GENDERS AND CAN EASILY FESTER INTO AN INCESSANT NEED FOR VALIDATION, CATHARSIS, STRONG AND ILL INFORMED OPINIONS AND FALSE STEREOTYPES, which also, ironically, leaves you vulnerable, to the worst of actors, the weak and incompetent herds of losers and incels that are preying on the sanctity of future generations… but that’s a different conversation.

As far as people go, you will attract/get drawn towards people that resonate with that version. Not every person is for you, in fact very few are, even in passing, and sometimes, when a yearning is left unacknowledged or god-forbid, answered but made improbable, it gets you an audience with poets and writers across centuries, who will have put into words everything you feel, and more… and not turn you into a creep or a women-hating shell of a man.

Strength is a subjective projection your capabilities, based on your true self, knowledge, ability, past experiences and events. You can fake it outside, you can be loud, obnoxious, objectifying, “hard” or “sigma” or “real man”, but you can’t lie to yourself, and if you have to project it, instead of it being exhibited, by virtue, intrinsically, your insecurities are talking to you, listen to them.

I live in Ireland and I hate how espresso taste in here (even some fancy coffee shops tend to do it bad), but I kinda like how Italian espresso is (more body, less acid, etc)

For someone who will pretty much drink double espresso, sometimes with ice (or I’ll try the cold brew in it), and now and then doing some iced oat lattes for my girlfriend, what beans should I get in here? 

Any other advice that would make me jump from shit coffee to a base Italian standard? ",0,1768292506.0,espresso,2,0.33,False
