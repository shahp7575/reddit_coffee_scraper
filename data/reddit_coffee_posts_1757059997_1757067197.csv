1n9145l,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1n9145l/insomnia/,Insomnia,"I get that insomnia is pretty common for PMDD. But I’m literally losing my mind. My motor skills are starting to be affected. I take 200 mg trazodone, 100 mg of Benadryl, 20 mg melatonin, 100 mg hydroxyzine, 8 mg of roserum, and a 0.3 clonidine I take all of that at the same time and I sleep for three hours, and then I wake up for the rest of the night. 

I asked my doctor, not a gynecologist or my mental health provider, she told me I needed to cut out my one cup of coffee that I have at 8 AM, told me I needed to sleep with my room, dark and cold, told me to cut out all chocolate, told me to use aromatherapy  

Essential oils trigger a migraine for me and are poisonous for my cats. I keep it 59° in here at night and absolutely pitch black. I have one singular cup of coffee at 8 o’clock in the morning and I don’t go to sleep until 10 PM and she’s saying that’s keeping me up. 

I have absolutely zero problem getting to sleep. I cannot sleep for more than 3 1/2 to 4 hours.

It’s making me even crazier than I am and I don’t even know what to do

Sometimes i start at 5pm and finish at 9am, or even 6:30pm to 10:30am etc... Today I finished fasting/started eating at about 10:15am making it about a 17 hour fast as I had a busy morning. I ate something small with a cup of coffee then had a huge lunch at 1 and finally finished my last cup of coffee at 2:30pm and I'm not planning on eating again until morning as I'm  still full....

Anyway... My question is; Does it matter if I mix up the times or will that ruin results? Is it better to stick to stricter times even though i still fast a minimum of 16 hours?

I'm living in Copenhagen for three years, and while I never felt alone (thanks to Fortabt in København community, the Support Group people, and some friends we met randomly), but if we talk about meeting somewhere, it's kind of a problem when it isn't summer. There's Bastard cafe, two of them, but that's about it.  
So we (me and my wife) hosted home parties for a while, but eventually we understood it's not enough, and she also needed some place for group lessons (she is a teacher), so we opened our own space - it's a time cafe, and it's for everyone who wants to spend time together.  
Yeah, it's kind of an advertisement, but we just opened, and for a community center, we're lacking a community (apart from some friends, but it could be more), so I wanted to call you, fellow copenhageners, to hang out this Sunday.   
\- We got some boardgames (and you can bring more or tell me what to buy, as we want to have a lot of them),  
\- We got a projector and a nice sound system if you bring a console (our SEGA/SNES emulator is still on it's way)  
\- Whatever else you want to do - you can, just don't break anything. There are generally three areas to hang out at, so plenty of space if you got your own thing going.  
\- Coffee, tea, and snacks are included into the price (and the price is 50kr first hour, then 25kr for subsequent ones - we set low prices so money wouldn't be a barrier for coming, but we do need to pay rent)

Where: Malmøgade, 4A, ""Kultur Multur"" (there's a button). It's 5 minute walk from Østerport

I grew up in Westchester, moved to NYC with my wife more than 12 years ago. Everything was incredible before covid: we used to go partying, drinking until sunset, visit insane amounts of coffee shops, go to lgbtq clubs in the west village every weekend, we were nonstop until covid. 

Then the shutdown, then the insecurity, closures, return to office, and you know the story.

Recently, I am able to leave the country and for the past year, we have travelled to Paris, Denmark, Belgium, UK and have become overwhelmed of how much I felt like I was living in precovid nyc.

I could drink until 2-4am, eat anywhere, felt safe walking the streets (sooo many people out!), the bars were popping, the stores were opened, the people were… yelling and happy and just… Free.

Everytime I return, I feel so sad of home. It blew my
mind how well these cities are doing and here I thinking that nowhere was as good as nyc.

I have been trying to go out, go to coffee shops and restaurants and bars. But nothing clicks, nothing feels right. I am trying to find purpose again in nyc, but i can’t find it.

My wife loves nyc, her family is here, her job and she keeps saying it’s nyc, there is nowhere in the world like nyc and that everyone’s dream in to come here. Everytime I bring up possibly starting a new life somewhere else, she gets upset about it. Why would you leave nyc, you knew the homelessness and all these things were an issue, etc. NYers always say the same thing, but I could see how happy she was in Europe, how free she felt and safe. 

It has been tough, so i’m asking everyone, why do you love nyc? if you lived here precovid, do you feel like the city has gotten back it’s light? Any new places to discover? Recommendations? Any clubs to make me feel alive?",0,1757066384.0,FoodNYC,2,0.25,False

1n90vut,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1n90vut/explore_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_braun/,Explore the Best Drip Coffee Maker Braun BrewSense Worth It,"**A Delightful Brewing Experience with the Braun KF6050WH**  

The Braun KF6050WH made its way into my kitchen after I became tired of inconsistent and lukewarm coffee from my old coffee machine. I prefer a product that combines functionality with a modern, sleek design, and this coffee maker seemed to promise just that. After weeks of daily use, I have quite a bit to say about this appliance, and while I am impressed overall, it isn’t without its quirks.  

**Effortless Design and Compact Elegance**  

One of the first things that struck me about this coffee maker is its effortlessly chic design. It is fairly compact, so it doesn’t hog countertop space, yet it feels sturdy enough to suggest durability. Its white finish complements my minimalist-inspired kitchen decor perfectly, and that stainless steel accent? Chef's kiss. The control panel, with its LED indicators and simple buttons, is intuitive even if you aren’t generally good with gadgets. Trust me, my uncle claims all modern appliances intimidate him, but he figured this out without a problem.  

**Automatic Features for the Win**  

Having a programmable 24-hour timer has been absolutely life-changing. I no longer dread that groggy morning wait for the first cup of coffee. Set it the night before, and you’ll wake up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee. It’s like having your own barista, minus the awkward chit-chat. Plus, the automatic shutoff ensures that I don’t panic every time I forget to turn it off.  

**Check [Braun KF6050WH BrewSense price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b07cpjf2bg/)**  

**Pure Flavor Technology Delivering on Taste**  

One thing that really stood out was the machine’s ability to deliver consistently rich and flavorful coffee, thanks to Braun’s pure flavor technology. Whether I’m brewing a full pot for when my friends come over or just using the 1-4 cup setting for some solo coffee time, the flavor hits the right notes every single time. Surprisingly, I didn’t think I’d notice much of a difference compared to my previous machine, but you can genuinely taste a more complex and robust coffee here.  

**Advantages**  

- Programmable timer saves you morning hassle.  
- Gold-tone filter ensures a natural coffee taste by keeping essential oils.  
- Brew pause system lets you sneak a cup mid-brew without a mess.  
- Water level indicator provides options for small or full brews.  

**Performance That Shines**  

The Braun BrewSense’s anti-drip system is truly an unsung hero. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve had to scrub stubborn drip stains off my countertops with other coffee makers. Not here. The brewing pause feature is perfect when patience isn’t my strong suit—I can pour a quick cup without compromising the process. On an average morning, I usually brew enough for two people, but it scales effortlessly when family visits.  

**Downsides**  

- Cleaning reminders aren't the most flexible and can be slightly finicky.  
- The brewing noise is moderate—not loud, but not silent either.  
- The cord storage could use a bit more space for a cleaner look.  

**Smarter Use of Resources with Reusable Filters**  

The decision to have a reusable gold-tone filter is both eco-conscious and practical. My sister, who’s big on zero-waste living, loves this feature and has stopped nagging me about single-use paper filters. It doesn’t end there; the built-in charcoal filter purifies water and genuinely makes a difference in taste—essential if you’re in an area with hard water like I am.  

**Competitive Options**  

Comparing this coffee maker to others in the same range, it holds its ground well. Take the Cuisinart DCC-3200, for example, which offers a similar programmable feature and decent brewing, but it doesn’t match Braun when it comes to the compact design or the richness of the taste. Then there’s the Ninja CE251, which arguably has a bit more versatility in brewing settings, but its filters don’t quite produce the same full-bodied flavor. While the Braun KF6050WH BrewSense may not be the fastest brewer in town, the taste quality is worth the wait.  

**Worth Every Penny**  

Taking into account all the features like the programmable timer, reusable filter, anti-drip mechanism, and its thoughtful design, this coffee maker offers excellent value for anyone who enjoys flavorful brewed coffee. It doesn’t try to be flashier than necessary; instead, it focuses on reliability and improving your daily coffee experience. After experiencing smooth mornings and appreciating the consistently rich coffee, I’d say it’s worth the investment if you want a dependable, easy-to-use machine that prioritizes taste.

1n90vqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n90vqs/aitah_slept_with_someone_2_months_after_my_ex/,AITAH- Slept with someone 2 months after my ex broke up with me,"Hi Guys, 

I think I’ve just ruined my chances at reconnecting with my ex but wanted some advice on what you would do in this situation.

My ex (22F) broke up with me (22M) at the beginning of July after we had been having lots of small arguments that had turned our relationship stressful. Since then we’ve had contact here and there (about once a week) and have checked in on each other. We both said we were adamant on focusing on ourselves.

Here’s where the mistake happens. About 2 weeks ago I slept with someone else. Before this happened I had tried everything to be back with my ex which was me pretty much begging for her back. Asking if we could try to come to an agreement that we will call this a ‘break’ and meet up for a coffee when she is back from holiday at the beginning of this month. She shut everything down and told me to focus on getting over her and moving on. 

I was struggling a lot emotionally and ended up sleeping with a girl who had approached me when I was out with some friends. It wasn’t about wanting anyone besides my ex and I was just trying to distract myself, now knowing this was the wrong way to cope. 

I reached out to my ex 4 days ago to check in on her and see how her holiday was going. We asked each other if we had seen anyone else and I was honest with her. In the moment, I wanted to be fully transparent with her and even sent her the texts between me and this other girl as I still wanted to be with my ex but wanted to put everything out there. She blew up on me, calling me a horrible person, how much she hates me and has wasted the last year of her life being with me. I know I’ve hurt her a lot, as I didn’t stay true to myself and what I had told her; being that I won’t be seeing anyone else.

Since the breakup I really have been working on myself and feel like I’ve grown a lot. I want to continue becoming a better person for myself and any future relationship I have. I still love my ex and want to try and reconnect with her when she’s ready. I’m planning on sending her a card for what would’ve been our 1 year anniversary next week but I’m unsure whether this is the right approach, or it may push her further away.

1n90tso,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1n90tso/i_did_not_hurt_them/,I did not Hurt Them,"Look, we’ve all fallen into the social media trap of doom scrolling, sometimes maybe even for hours on end. We as a human species have reached a point in our timeline where every ounce of our day could be consumed by the small computer that we each conceal in our pockets. I’m no different than anyone else; I, too, have succumbed to this trap on multiple occasions, too many to even count.

But there’s something evil within these apps. I don’t know what it is or how it works. Hell, this may be a demon designated to me alone. Or an AI, who knows at this point? All I know is the other night, I was lying in bed after a long day’s work, trying to unwind and scroll some reels. Everything was normal for the first hour or so; the usual car accidents, shitposts, and memes. However, as I fell deeper into the doomscrolling, I came across a video that just showed…me..? Sitting at the dinner table with my brother and parents. The table was set beautifully, and my mother had prepared a nice meal of what seemed to be meatloaf, a meal she had never cooked before.

I was completely stunned. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, and the video went on for 10 straight minutes, just showing us as we ate quietly. Once every plate was cleaned, and we all started to get up to walk away, the video restarted back to the beginning. I rushed to my parents’ room to show them what I’d found, but by the time I got there, the feed had refreshed entirely.

I mean, how do you even explain that to someone, “hey, I just saw us eating dinner on Instagram, that’s probably something to look out for,” like what? No. Luckily, though, I had remembered the username. I typed user.44603380 into the Instagram search bar, and only one account popped up. When I clicked on it, I was baffled to find that there were no posts made at all, just a blank page. However, there was one clear sign of evidence that I was looking in the right place: the profile picture.

See, this account had zero followers, zero following, and everything about the page looked grey and new. Everything except for the profile picture, which was me, yet again, staring into the camera for a photo I did not take. My face was soulless and hollow. Barely maintaining the essence of a human.

This was clear evidence, though, and I ran to show my parents again. I was profoundly disappointed when both my mom and dad insisted that it had to be one of my friends playing some kind of prank on me. I don’t know why I expected either of them to understand. I mean, they’re parents, what do they know about social media? Nevertheless, I reported the account for pretending to be someone else, and by the next morning, it had been taken down. Relieved, I went to work with warmth in my chest.

When I got home, I repeated the process. Kicked my shoes off, plopped down on the bed, and began scrolling. This time, a good quarter of what I saw was me, posted from different, all-new accounts. None of the videos were actually me; they all captured me doing things that I had never once done. Walking a dog I never had, browsing at a library I’d never seen before, all taken from obscure angles like the person behind the camera was hiding.

Thoroughly creeped out, I reported every single page I came across. It totaled up to something like 30 different accounts, all dedicated to me, and I got the notification when each one had been taken down. I decided to take a break from the reels after that, putting my phone away in a drawer and going outside for some fresh air. I actually didn’t even pick up my phone again until it was time for work the next day.

When I did, a notification was displayed across the screen. I had been informed that my Instagram account had been taken down for “pretending to be someone else.”

I didn’t know what to do, so I sent an appeal to Instagram and just went to work, albeit a little on edge. When I got off, I was astounded to find that my appeal had been rejected and that it would take 30 days before I could launch a new one.

Whatever, right, but I had a real problem going on, I couldn’t just not watch as it unfolded. I set up a basic new account and started scrolling. It didn’t take long before I found myself again. Getting coffee, stopping off for gas, interacting with people I’d never met. Eventually, that’s all that my new page consisted of: just videos of me every time I scrolled. There were now too many accounts to report all with that same random string of numbers username.

As I scrolled, the videos changed. I was no longer out doing the mundane. I was now walking down the road in every video. Walking down a road that I recognized as the one just before my actual neighborhood. Then it was in my driveway, then at my doorstep, then, as if nothing happened, back to the regular Instagram feed. Puppies, nature, advertisements. All the accounts were gone. All the videos were gone. And I felt like I was going crazy.

I tossed my phone to the side and just lay in my bed, staring up at the ceiling. I drifted off into deep thought, which eventually turned into sleep. When I awoke, I went through my normal process: getting dressed, making the bed, you know the deal.

When I checked my phone, I stood utterly horrified as hundreds of videos showed up, all with thousands of views, all showing the third-person perspective of me murdering my parents.

I basically exploded out of my bedroom door to find the walls coated in blood, so much so that it appeared the walls were leaking with the crimson liquid. The smell of iron radiated throughout the entire house, and when I entered my parents’ bedroom, I found them sprawled across the bed, stab wounds decorating their bare torsos.

Instagram still pulled up on my device, I heard as police sirens came flooding in through the phone’s speakers. When I raised the screen to my face, I saw myself, standing over my parents’ bed, cellphone in hand. A mixture of confusion, desperation, and terror plastered across my face.

That’s when the room began to flash red and blue as police lights came pouring in through the bedroom windows. A loud pounding came from the front door before it flew open and splintered as an armed SWAT unit came rushing in, rifles trained on me. They pinned me to the floor, and my phone went flying from my hand, bouncing across the floor and landing propped up against the wall.

The last thing I saw on the feed was me being handcuffed before it refreshed back to the kittens and baking recipes. I was brought in for questioning, and my lawyer insisted I plead insanity. I’m writing this from a holding cell in a notebook, and I plan to have my lawyer publish it and send it out to wherever he can.

Please, you all have to believe me: I did not cause this. I did not hurt them.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I have 2 GSDs, one is 5, one is 12. I am very, very active with and without my dogs. Both very headstrong, sassy, and clingy. Both girls. 

Without my dogs, I run 10-13 miles a day. It just doesn’t seem like a great activity for even my younger pup. My old lady did a couple 10 milers with me in her prime no problem, but I didn’t know at the time if that was a joint health risk or not. 

With my dogs, we do 3-5 miles of walking with some off leash activity thrown in (old lady still goes hard), daily coffee shop and errands, beers and swim twice a week - all in about 1.5-2hours of moderate intensity activity a day. LOTS of societal interaction and stimulation. 

Could a Belgian malanois do that kind of running and subsequent walking on a daily basis? Would it be enough? Too much of the wrong kind of exercise?

We live in the sun belt, so heat and humidity are considerations, though I’m typically done running at or before sunrise. 

I love GSDs and am happy to stick with the breed, but I’d strongly consider a Belgian if they’d *enjoy* running with me.

No flare ups and any little reactions were easily controlled by a dab of betnovate- a tube of that would last years. Diprobase to go with it, and ACV tablets if I ‘felt’ a reaction coming… I will admit at that time I wasn’t searching for a trigger, because any outbreaks were so minor.

Cut to this year, and I had a full blown outbreak on my hands which I barely brought under control. Suddenly my tried and tested methods did not work and I put it down to stress. A house move, change of job, busier but full life all contributing. Now I think diet was involved, as I am eating healthier- more coffee, whole grain shizz, making my own granola… nickel made sense and I’ve since cut back on a lot of that stuff to positive effect.

My question is what is left, because I still use betnovate, cotton gloves, SLS free shower products etc, and a month ago I had a 5-day course of flucoaxcillin and then a further two weeks of it. It had some effect but this area on the bottom of my left palm just hasn’t gone away. I often wake to a minor new outbreak (blisters) on the edges. Similar on the right side of my right foot. It seems to just self sustain and the cycle hasn’t broken. Any minor outbreaks elsewhere are manageable and more like before. This makes me think the area in the photos is more than just an ongoing outbreak of dyshidrosis?

I have another doctor’s appointment later this month, but I wanted to see what this excellent community thought. TIA!

It happens, we've all done it. And, this week, I did it really fucking well! 

I used to be a big emotional water, shitloads of therapy, nearly 10 years of keto / low carb and periods of IF have helped me get that stuff sorted. However, life is a bit bouncy atm and one phone call a few days ago was just enough to tip me completely. Sure, I could blame hormones, justify it by saying I wasn't going to fast this week anyway for other reasons - but, nope, I'm owning it. I hung up the phone and I was done. I got in my car and went to the shops and bought a range of foods that I wouldn't normally eat together. Each one, wasn't entirely unhealthy, but it was far more than I would usually eat. 

Did it make me feel better in the moment? Yes. Did I regret it the next day? Honestly, not really. I had actually made fairly decent choices and as such I didn't feel too ill from it all. Did I make a choice to not fast again until this weekend and therefore eat foods I usually avoid for the last couple of days as well? Yep. 

But, tomorrow I'll get back up and keep going. I'll set the fasting timer for tonight and be back into 16:8 tomorrow and hopefully back up to 20:4 by the end of next week. I'll keep listening to my body and giving it salt when it needs it and water when it is thirsty. I don't drink coffee so it will be water and tea for me, and bone broth and nutrient dense food during my eating window.  

So, yeah, sorry for the ramble but I just wanted to put it out there that stuff ups happen, and sometimes we feel like shit as a result. The important thing is the listen to your body and get back to what you know feels good!

The 2026 World Cup qualifiers have arrived, and Sweden vs. Slovenia is the kind of match that makes you wonder if the Swedes packed a lunch of *meatballs and hubris* while Slovenia brought a thermos of *stoic determination*. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Swedish clockmaker and the humor of a Slovenian stand-up comedian.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The bookmakers are as clear as a frosty Swedish lake: **Sweden is the favorite**, with implied probabilities hovering around **45-50%** to win (thanks to decimal odds like 2.18 on BetOnline.ag). Slovenia? They’re the underdog at \~27%, but don’t sleep on them—they’ve got a **30% chance of a draw**, which is higher than your odds of finding a functional coffee machine in a European stadium.

The spread line? Sweden is favored by **0.25 goals**, meaning they’re expected to win or at least not lose. For bettors, this is like saying “bring an umbrella, but maybe not.” The total goals line is **2.25**, so expect a game where both teams score once, and maybe a second goal will sneak in like a guest who overstays their welcome.

---

### Recent Form: Sweden’s Attack vs. Slovenia’s “I’ve Seen This Before” Defense

Sweden’s recent form is the culinary equivalent of a five-star meatball feast:

* **4-3-2-1 in their last five matches**, including a **6-0 thrashing of Azerbaijan**.
* Their attack? A well-oiled machine with **Isaac and Bergvall** as the main course.
* But wait—is **Alexander Isak** even starting? The Expressen article questions his role, which is like asking if the meatballs are gluten-free. Mystery meat, anyone?

Slovenia, meanwhile, is the underdog with the heart of a Viking and the defense of a medieval castle:

* **3 wins, 2 draws in their last five**, including a **1-0 shutout over Luxembourg**.
* Their recent 2-1 win over Bosnia-Herzegovina? A

The smell of coffee lingers in the back of the hall, mingling with the faint polish of the wooden pews. It is an ordinary morning to the senses of the flesh. Yet heaven leans near, for one among them has been emptied before God and clothed with His presence.  

When the elders ask him to speak, he rises. His steps across the floor sound to human ears like soft thuds, but in the Spirit every footfall echoes like a herald announcing the arrival of the King. The man himself feels nothing of his own strength. His heart beats quietly in submission. His lips move in prayer even before his mouth opens to address the people.  

As he takes his place at the front, something shifts. The air grows heavy with a fragrance not of this world. It is like myrrh mingled with the sweetness of spring rain. The stillness is almost tangible. Children fidgeting in the pews suddenly quiet. A sacred hush draws across the room as though unseen hands have stilled the atmosphere.  

And then it happens. The Lord Himself enters. Not as an idea. Not as a mere stirring of emotion. His presence descends like fire that cannot be touched yet warms the bones. The light in the room seems brighter, though no candle is lit and no switch is touched. Every sound sharpens. Every breath is filled with the awareness of holiness. To spiritual eyes, angels gather in ranks along the edges of the congregation, their heads bowed, wings veiling their faces before the Majesty who has come to dwell.  

Those bound in fear feel chains slip from their shoulders. The proud feel their hearts struck with the weight of truth. Tears well in the eyes of the weary who suddenly taste hope on their tongues. To some, it feels like cool water after long thirst. To others, it burns like a refining flame that exposes every hidden thought. The presence of the Lord wraps itself around each soul in the way they most need, never confused, never mistaken, always perfect.  

The man speaks, yet it is no longer his voice. His words pour forth with clarity like streams breaking from a rock in the desert. They carry weight, not because of eloquence, but because they are alive. Each syllable seems to ring, as though the Spirit Himself strikes a bell deep within every heart. Scripture comes not as a lesson, but as a sword that divides soul and spirit, revealing what lies hidden and calling forth what God has planted.  

The enemy flees, for the darkness cannot remain when Light stands in the room. Demons tremble and retreat to shadows outside the walls. Hidden sins rise to the surface, not to bring shame, but to bring deliverance. The room swells with the holy tension of conviction and comfort at once. Some fall to their knees, unable to stand beneath the glory. Others lift their hands as though their very bodies cannot contain the praise that erupts within.  

The sound of weeping fills one corner. In another, soft laughter of freedom begins to flow. The congregation does not look to the man any longer, for their eyes are fixed upon the One who has come among them. As John testified, *“He must increase, but I must decrease”* (John 3:30 NASB). The vessel is forgotten, the Presence remembered.  

When at last the man stops speaking, no one moves quickly. Time itself seems suspended. The fragrance of heaven lingers. A holy awe clings to the walls, the chairs, the very air. Hearts know they have been pierced. Souls know they have been healed. Children know without words that God is near.  

And when the moment finally passes, the people leave marked forever. They may not all explain it, but something in them whispers again and again: the Lord was here.  ",1,1757064115.0,messianic,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone. I’ve been gambling online in Canada for around five years now, and since so many folks keep asking about the best Interac online casino sites, I figured I’d share what I’ve learned as of 2025. When I first started, I used credit cards and random e‑wallets, but I soon switched to Interac e‑Transfer because it’s faster, safer, and much more convenient.
Back in the day, playing at land‑based casinos like Fallsview or Casino Montreal meant a long drive and waiting for a table. Over time, I realized that online casino interac platforms offer more convenience, more games, and better control over how I play. This post isn’t about hyping any particular site — just sharing what a Canadian gambler has figured out, especially around Interac deposits and withdrawals.

What Makes the Best Interac Casino Online

After testing dozens of Canadian online casinos that accept Interac e‑Transfer, I’ve noticed a few key things that separate the solid sites from the shady ones:
Fast Interac deposits and withdrawals. Deposits should land instantly (they usually do), and withdrawals shouldn’t take more than a few days. Interac withdrawals typically reach your bank in 1–3 business days after the casino’s internal review.

1) Trusted software providers. Look for games from Pragmatic Play, NetEnt, Microgaming, Play’n GO, etc.

2) Support that understands Canadian banking. Staff should be familiar with Interac e‑Transfer, not just generic payment methods.

3) Smooth mobile play. Slots and table games should work flawlessly on your phone.

4) Reasonable bonuses. Watch for wagering requirements that aren’t ridiculous.

The Reality of Online Gambling in Canada

Online gambling in Canada exists in a grey area. Most casino interac online platforms are licensed offshore (Malta, Curaçao, Kahnawake) but still accept Canadian players. The industry has matured in the last few years, and online casinos for real money have become more sophisticated. Many Canadians use Interac daily: it’s a domestic network established in 1984, and in 2022 Interac processed over a billion transactions in a single year, which speaks to how trusted it is.

However, major banks like RBC and TD sometimes block or reverse gambling-related transfers. In my experience, sticking to Interac e‑Transfer (rather than Interac Online) and using well‑known licensed casinos avoids most of the issues. You may encounter daily withdrawal limits around C$2,000 - C$3,000, so plan accordingly.

What Interac Online Casino Sites Actually Offer

The top Interac online casinos in 2025 typically provide:

1) Thousands of slot titles and casino games. Top sites offer 1,000–3,000 slots, with new releases weekly.

2) Real-money blackjack, roulette, and baccarat. Live dealers stream from studios, making the online experience feel like a brick‑and‑mortar venue.

3) Banking in Canadian dollars with Interac e‑Transfer. Deposits are often instant, and withdrawals can be processed via Interac e‑Transfer or other e‑wallets.

4) Mobile apps or responsive websites. You can play anywhere, whether you’re at home or on a coffee break.

How I Find a Reputable Online Casino in Canada

When I’m looking at new online casino interac e transfer sites, here’s my checklist:

1) Licensing. Curacao and Malta are common, but some players prefer Kahnawake or Ontario‑licensed sites.

2) Real player reviews. Reddit threads and forums give honest feedback on payout reliability and support.

3) CAD banking options. If the site doesn’t offer Interac or other CAD-friendly methods, it’s not worth my time.

4) Track record. How long has the casino served Canadian players? A new site might offer huge bonuses but could disappear overnight.

5) Responsible gambling tools. Self-exclusion and deposit limits are must-haves for safe play.

Real Money Games Like Canadians Actually Play

The best Interac casinos aren’t just about flashy slots (though those are fun). Here’s what’s popular right now:

1) Online Slots. Most Interac casinos focus heavily on slots. Titles from Play’n GO (fun features, solid RTP), Pragmatic Play (big jackpots, loads of choices), Microgaming (classics), and NetEnt (polished graphics) dominate the lobbies. Top sites often have 2,000+ slot titles.

2) Table & Live Dealer Games. You’ll find live blackjack with Canadian-friendly dealers, multiple roulette variants (European, American, Lightning), baccarat for all bankrolls, and often poker or video poker rooms.

3) Specialty & Crash Games. Some sites feature crash or instant-win games for quick adrenaline hits.

Money Management at Interac Online Casinos

This part matters more than the games themselves:

1) Set deposit limits before you start. Interac makes it easy to send money, so set a budget and stick to it.

2) Stick to your bankroll. Don’t chase losses — it never ends well.

3) Use bonuses wisely. Some sites have reasonable wagering, while others trap you. Read the terms before claiming.

4) Think of it as entertainment. Online gambling should be fun; treat any win as a bonus, not a paycheck.

What Good Interac Casinos Do Right

The best online casino canada interac platforms stand out because they:

1) Offer support during Canadian hours. Getting help at 3 a.m. matters.

2) Are optimized for Canadian internet speeds. Smooth play even in rural areas is a plus.

3) Have CAD banking without hidden fees. No conversion to USD or EUR.

4) Provide mobile gameplay that doesn’t crash on Telus, Rogers, or Shaw networks.

Current State of Online Gambling in Canada

Canada’s gambling market is shifting. Physical casinos are still busy, but more people are going online. Offshore casinos remain accessible, and the best real‑money sites are adapting to Canadian players’ needs. As long as you stick with licensed platforms and use trusted payment methods like Interac, you’re in decent shape.

What Safe Interac Online Casinos Provide

The most reputable Interac casinos in 2025 always include:

1) Secure deposits and withdrawals in CAD. Transactions are encrypted and backed by bank-level security.

2) Transparent return-to-player (RTP) percentages. Many providers publish RTPs, so you know game fairness.

3) Responsible gambling tools. Self-exclusion, deposit limits, and reality checks help keep things under control.

4) Reasonable withdrawal times. Interac e‑Transfer withdrawals usually take 1–3 business days after approval, sometimes faster if auto-deposit is enabled.

Online Casino Experience vs Land-Based in Canada

These days, the online experience often matches or surpasses physical venues:

1) Better payout rates (RTPs). Online slots can offer higher RTPs than land-based machines.

2) No travel or parking costs. Play in your pajamas if you want.

3) 24/7 access. No need to wait for a seat at your favorite table.

4) Comfort and privacy. You control your environment and pace.

Finding Your Match

Not every online casino interac payment site is the same. Some excel at slots, others at live dealers or specialty games. Picking your best fit depends on:

1) Game preferences. Slots vs table games vs live dealers.

2) Bonus style. Some offer huge welcome bonuses; others reward loyalty.

3) Banking needs. Interac, credit card, crypto — choose what suits you.

4) Preferred device. Playing mainly on mobile? Make sure the interface works smoothly.

Final Thoughts on Real Money Interac Casinos

After years of playing, I’ve learned that the best Interac online casino isn’t always the flashiest. The platforms that stand out pay quickly, offer fair terms, and don’t mess players around.

Online casinos beat land-based options for convenience and variety. Start small, test withdrawals early, and see what fits your style. At the end of the day, gambling online in Canada should be fun. Set your limits, gamble responsibly, and enjoy yourself.

What about you? Have you found an Interac online casino that actually delivers? I’d love to hear how other Canadians are navigating the 2025 Interac casino landscape.

Back in 2012, I was 26 and my fiancée (now my wife) was 24. I wanted to surprise her with a pair of Red Wings, but in Singapore at the time, it was almost impossible to get women’s sizes, especially something as small as a US 4.5D.

After countless failed attempts locally, I took to the internet and reached out directly to Red Wing Amsterdam. A gentleman named Mitch replied to me, and through email exchanges he helped source the size and arranged for delivery all the way to Singapore. To this day, I don’t know if Mitch still works there, but I’ll never forget his effort. It meant the world to us.

Fast forward a year later, we were on our honeymoon in Amsterdam. My wife suddenly remembered:

“The Red Wings you got me were from Amsterdam, right? Let’s go to the store!”

So we did. I asked for Mitch, but unfortunately he wasn’t there. Instead, his colleague listened to our story, congratulated us on our marriage, and promised to pass on the message. He even invited us to hang out for coffee in the store. The gesture of hospitality left us pleasantly shocked — though in our shyness, we politely declined. Still, it was one of those small moments you carry for life.

The Boots Today

Now, more than a decade on, those same 8131s, broken in, patinated and worn with love, have taken on another chapter. Our son, now 11, is currently the same shoe size as his mother. He’s lacing them up, rocking them and carrying on the story of these boots in his own way.

From fiancée, to wife, to son.

The same pair has quietly lived through all these milestones.

I walked into the experience with high hopes, and luckily, this multi-purpose pencil didn’t disappoint, though a few quirks did leave room for improvement.

Could one sleek pencil really do it all—lips, eyes, cheeks, and even brows? I had to find out.

**A Design Perfect for Everyday Use**

From the moment I unboxed it, the sleek, compact design stood out. Measuring just 0.4 x 0.4 x 6 inches and weighing 0.3 ounces, the pencil is travel-friendly and perfect for slipping into a small clutch or makeup bag. Its weightlessness made carrying it around feel like I had nothing extra on hand, yet its build feels sturdy, not flimsy. After endless runs through my daily routine, I’ve tossed and retrieved it countless times, and the simple design didn’t scuff or crack. While its minimalist design doesn’t scream luxury, there’s something effortlessly chic about its simplicity.

Testing its multi-use claim was like embarking on an artistic adventure. I started with the lip liner function, and I appreciated how precise the tip was, creating sharp, clean lines even after multiple uses. Blending it out for a softer lip look was a breeze, and the creamy texture helped it glide seamlessly. But where it really surprised me was on my eyes and cheeks. This pencil’s pigment lent itself beautifully to soft smudges at my lash line and blended out well enough to act as an unconventional earthy eyeshadow shade. For cheeks, a few dots blended into my skin for a natural flush—and it worked particularly well on lazy mornings where I didn’t want to lug around countless products.

**Benefits**

- The ability to use this pencil across multiple areas of the face is genuinely a game changer for reducing product clutter.  
- Highly pigmented, providing rich color payoff without constant reapplication.  
- The creamy texture makes blending nearly effortless, both for bold and subtle looks.  

**Precision vs. Longevity: The Battle of Performance**

While the pencil delivers on precision and blendability, it tends to fall short in the longevity department. On lips, the color lasted through a few coffee sips, but a full meal? Not so much. As an eyeliner, it held up decently during an eight-hour workday when set with translucent powder but started to crease ever so slightly by hour five. I’ll admit, my cheeks wore it best. Its staying power as a blush showed consistent pigmentation throughout the day, even after a slightly humid subway commute. Still, for anyone looking for hours of reliability in one single swipe, this product might feel like it needs a touch more endurance.

**Flaws**

- Limited wear time, especially on lips, requiring midday touch-ups.  
- The creamy finish, while great for blending, doesn’t stay firm for precise lines once blunted.  
- Lacks a built-in sharpener, which would’ve been handy considering how quickly the tip dulls during multi-purpose use.  

**Competing Brands**

When compared to similar products, this pencil holds up surprisingly well, but it doesn’t completely outshine some alternatives. Take NARS’s multi-purpose sticks, for example. While they share a similar concept, those sticks feel more robust for cheek and lip applications but fall short on thin, precise lines for eyes. Meanwhile, NYX offers a more budget-friendly alternative with their multi-use jumbo pencils, but those lack the same refined pigment payoff and blending ease. Honestly, for the price range this pencil fits into, the balance it strikes between design and versatility feels justifiable, though not completely unbeatable.

**Affordable Quality**

Given its versatility and solid performance in most areas, the price point feels reasonable compared to market rivals, but it’s not knocking my socks off as the best deal I’ve encountered. The creamy consistency and on-the-go practicality absolutely justify some of the cost, especially for anyone who values minimizing their routine with a single tool.

Now present is the sort of natural and artificial refuse one might find on a riverbank where people dwell.  I also added some precious metals items to simulate panning for Gold and Silver.  Feel free to add items, as I could have realistically added many more.  Scum Admin Helper is useful for providing the Item ID to plug in.  I increased the number of items possible to find to reflect the length of riverbank that each spawner covers and to offset the difficulty of digging up earthworms with so many other items in the pool.

You can upload this to your SCUM > Saved > Config > WindowsServer > Loot > Spawners > Presets > Override folder, creating that folder if you don't already have it.  I imagine this can be used for the single-player experience, too, but as soon as I started playing multiplayer 6 years ago I haven't dabbled in single-player much, so you'll have to find the parallel folder on your gaming system.

The changes should take effect at your server's next restart.

Not exactly today, but it only dawned on me today 

I’m a secondary school teacher and have been for many a year. I’m also a smoker(tobacco)but I never smoke inside. As a teacher I drink a bit of coffee, to underline a stereotype. 

During Covid, I taught my students online, which was horrible in ever sense of the word. Now, I’m not allowed smoking when I’m at work, so that’s not an issue, but when I taught online I could go for a smoke between sessions, as well as going to the bathroom.
Also I can go down in my yard and smoke in weekends whenever I like, obviously. 

Today, my daughter(12), remarked that I always seem to go to the bathroom after a smoke, and I realised she is right! I go for a smoke when I need to pee. Somehow, during Covid-lockdown this became a habit. 

This also means I it will be easier to focus on quitting, since I have figured out one of the triggers. 

TL;DR: Taught from home, smoked during breaks, now conditioned to smoke when I need to pee.

These kitchen appliances are essential for grinding food scraps and preventing unpleasant odors. However, they are not designed to handle all types of waste as these systems can easily become clogged with food debris if not cleaned regularly.

So, whether you are a seasoned homeowner or a first-time user, we'll go over the pros and cons of having a garbage disposal in your home!

* Makes post-meal cleanup significantly easier and more efficient
* Particularly helpful for families that generate more food scraps

# Simple Installation and Maintenance

* Designed to fit easily under most standard kitchen sinks
* Only requires a power source and connection to the drain pipe
* Basic maintenance is straightforward:
   * Run cold water during and after use
   * Clean regularly with ice cubes and rock salt
   * Remember to turn off power before clearing the basket

# Increases Home Value

# Limited Repair Options

* When parts wear out, typically the entire unit needs replacement
* Internal components and motors aren't sold separately
* Units aren't designed to be opened for repairs
* While clogs can be addressed, mechanical failures usually require full replacement

# Food Restrictions and Limited Capacity

* Despite the name, not all food waste can go in a garbage disposal
* Prohibited items include:
   * Fatty foods and cream sauces
   * Coffee grounds
   * Starchy and soft foods
   * Bones and seafood shells
   * Fibrous vegetables and fruits
* Designed only for small amounts of food scraps
* Best for residual food particles that can't be easily scraped into trash

# Is a Garbage Disposal Right for Your Home?

When deciding whether to install a garbage disposal, consider your household's cooking habits, the age of your plumbing system, and your willingness to maintain the unit properly. While the convenience factor is significant, being mindful of its limitations will help ensure your garbage disposal serves you well for years to come.

Remember that proper use and regular maintenance are key to avoiding most common issues with garbage disposals. With the right care, this kitchen appliance can be a valuable addition to your home.",1,1757062922.0,USDIY,0,1.0,False

1n90587,https://www.reddit.com/r/Threadwalkers/comments/1n90587/the_ginsoaked_mirror_how_18thcentury_london/,The Gin-Soaked Mirror: How 18th-Century London Forged the Modern Media Panic,"The conventional history of 18th-century London’s “Gin Craze” is a simple and satisfying morality play. It is a story of a debauched urban underclass brought to its knees by cheap spirits, a crisis heroically chronicled and ultimately condemned by the great artist and social commentator, William Hogarth. This narrative, however, is a masterful piece of historical propaganda, a “lie at the base level” crafted for political and commercial gain. The truth is far more complex and far more modern. The Gin Craze was not a simple public health crisis; it was the first great moral panic of the modern media age, a perfect storm of a new drug, a new information ecosystem, class hypocrisy, and political opportunism, all ignited by a spark of real, terrifying violence. It created a blueprint for media manipulation that remains chillingly relevant today.

At the heart of this storm was a radical new technological and social landscape. The rise of the coffee house and the printing press created an information network that was the 18th-century equivalent of the internet. Coffee houses, which often served alcohol alongside caffeine, were the central nodes of this network, the social media platforms of their day where news, gossip, and business were exchanged at high speed. The burgeoning newspaper industry and the advent of cheap, mass-produced prints acted as the amplifiers, capable of turning a local rumour into a city-wide panic overnight. This new, powerful, and largely unregulated ecosystem was the fertile ground in which the Gin Craze narrative was planted and cultivated.

This narrative was not, however, an organic growth. It was a tool, deliberately weaponized in a wider political conflict. The ruling Hanoverian establishment, seeking to solidify its control, found a perfect scapegoat in gin. The drink was cheap, domestically produced, and associated with the chaotic, independent spirit of the urban poor. Its opposite, imported French brandy, was the drink of the aristocracy and, more importantly, was associated with the foreign, Catholic, and politically threatening Jacobite cause. By launching a moral crusade against gin, the government was not just promoting temperance; it was performing an act of social control, demonizing the culture of the lower classes while subtly linking their political opponents to foreign tastes and treachery. The great hypocrisy, of course, was that heavy drinking was a universal vice across all classes. The panic was a targeted projection, a way for an elite to condemn a behaviour in the poor that they privately practiced themselves.

Into this politically charged environment stepped William Hogarth. The popular image of Hogarth as a dispassionate moral chronicler is a carefully constructed myth, a “false idol” that serves the very media narrative he helped to create. Hogarth was, first and foremost, a brilliant and commercially savvy artist who understood the power of this new media ecosystem better than anyone. He was not merely documenting a crisis; he was creating a product for a specific market. His famous prints, *Gin Lane* and *Beer Street*, are not objective journalism; they are powerful, politically aligned advertisements. *Gin Lane* depicts a hellscape of poverty, death, and social decay, while *Beer Street* shows a vision of happy, industrious, and healthy English citizens nourished by good, wholesome beer. The message was clear, simple, and perfectly aligned with the government’s agenda. The newspapers and coffee houses eagerly consumed and amplified his work, and Hogarth, the “broke drawer,” found fame and fortune by giving the establishment the viral content it needed.

Every successful moral panic, however, requires a kernel of truth to make the exaggerated fears feel plausible. In 18th-century London, that kernel was provided by the very real and very terrifying violence of the Mohocks. These “Young Bucks” — privileged, often newly wealthy young men — terrorized the streets at night, engaging in acts of random, brutal violence not for money, but for sport. The stories of their cruelty provided the perfect, terrifying backdrop for the Gin Craze narrative. The press and the politicians skillfully blended the two threats, taking the specific, aristocratic violence of the Mohocks and fusing it with the general, lower-class consumption of gin. This created a monstrous hybrid in the public imagination: the gin-crazed, violent poor, a threat that seemed to justify any level of state intervention and control.

In the end, the Gin Craze was a mirror, reflecting not just the social ills of a city grappling with a new drug, but the birth of a new and powerful system of social control. The perfect storm of a new media ecosystem, political opportunism, class hypocrisy, and a core of real violence created a template for how to manufacture a moral panic. The strategies are timeless: identify a scapegoat, leverage new media to amplify fear, use a kernel of truth to make the narrative stick, and create “false idols” to sell a particular worldview. It is a story that, as you know from your own research, has been re-written in the pages of our newspapers, and now on our digital screens, for centuries.

Yesterday, he suddenly decided we had to drive back home a day earlier because he “needed to drop off a paper” at his office. I didn’t really have a choice, he just said “we’re leaving” and I went along.

It was a long drive, and by the time we got back I was exhausted, with a headache. When we reached his office, he told me to wait in the car because he just had to hand over the paper. I thought it would take 2 minutes.

Instead, he left, then I saw him sitting outside with his coworkers smoking and laughing. He waved at me to come over. I was annoyed because I had told him I wanted to go home and rest, but I had to take our cat (Eloise) out of the car because it was too hot. The first thing everyone did when they saw me was look at my pregnant belly.

I told him again: “I want to go home.”
He said: “Wait a bit, I have something to tell them… let’s go upstairs for coffee.”
I said: “No, I’ll go home alone.”
He laughed and said: “Well, I have the car keys.”

His coworkers also laughed. Then he said: “She’s just acting like this because she’s tired.” I felt humiliated in front of strangers.

He dragged me upstairs with him, into the kitchen area with his colleagues. I thought maybe he had something work-related to discuss, but nope. It was just gossip about a fight between two coworkers who had screamed at each other and gotten fired. They were reenacting it word for word, and my boyfriend was asking a million questions like, “What did the team lead say?” and “What did you write in the group chat after?”

At that point, I was literally PRAYING the TL would show up and tell him to go home, because clearly I couldn’t convince him.

Meanwhile, I was sitting there like an accessory. And the worst part? He was passing my cat Eloise around to whoever wanted to hold her, without even asking me. A girl said, “Can I pet her?” and he literally just handed her over.

The irony? He was there to submit a sick leave form. Officially, he was “sick.” But instead of being home resting, he was sitting at the office gossiping and showing off his pregnant girlfriend and cat.

I felt like I (and Eloise) were treated like objects he couldn’t leave behind, not like actual people with needs. I told him many times I don’t want to go upstairs with him anymore, that I’m not his assistant, but he keeps saying: “You don’t need to feel uncomfortable.”

I (32F) am crushing on this guy (30M) super hard, but we work for two separate companies that are doing business with each other. He works for a local newspaper, and I work for a company who pays to run ads in that paper. We are each other's contact, so I am technically his client, and we are both in marketing positions for our respective companies.

I've spoken with him a few times before in person, and we vibe really well. Most recently, he came and toured our office, and we spoke for a really long time about our lives with a tiny bit of actual business talk at the end. I suspect that he likes me too, but I can't seem to get the courage to ask if he is single or to give him my number. Part of me just wants to shoot my shot and give him my number with a ""no pressure at all!"" in case he is actually not interested, but the other part of me is scared to ruin this professional connection for my company. I just don't want to make it weird.

Would any of you guys in sales/marketing be weirded out if a client gave you their personal number and asked you to coffee? Would you feel pressured or creeped out? I would assume if he wasn't interested that we could just move past it and still work together, but my anxiety is holding me back in case he reacts badly. It's not a business relationship that will end any time soon, as we will no doubt continue to advertise through them.

I guess I just either need some reassurance, or someone to talk me out of it. He seems like a great guy, and I don't want to miss out because I was a coward. I'm a bigger girl, which has always given me self-confidence issues, but I've also never asked a guy out either. It's not so much the rejection that I fear, I know not everyone finds me attractive and that's fine.

And just like my 2016 wardrobe choices, this claim hasn’t aged at all—it's simply true. Whether we’re talking about self-driving cars or AI personal assistants that sometimes double as DJ requests re-interpreters, AI in 2025 is just automation with fancier pants.

**Automation vs. AI: Old vs. New?**  
While AI sounds like something straight out of a sci-fi thriller with glowing red eyes and a vendetta, automation reminds us more of the trusty machines that silently make our coffee or assemble our IKEA furniture components after we’ve lost the will to live. Yet, peel away the layers of sci-fi fantasies, and what do you get? The same mindless, albeit efficient, automation.

**The Hype Machine**  
Futurists like Ray Kurzweil and Elon Musk paint AI as some sort of evolutionary leap from our sterile lives to a robot-dominated utopia. Yet, if there’s one thing sci-fi movies have taught us, it’s that these dystopias often come with an ominous backdrop of gray. Currently, AI lacks that glaringly human attribute—a mind—and remains steadfast in its automation cocoon.

**Wide AI—The Middle Child of AI Evolution**  
Enter Wide AI, armed with its conversational flair. While it boasts a broader conversational reach, it’s still just wearing a tuxedo at the automation party. The next-gen models might charm you with witty banter, but make no mistake, they’re still systems executing programmed commands—just with more flair than your usual software.

**Discussion Point:**  
As we ride on this wave of high-tech evolution, our understanding of AI remains entangled with sci-fi spectacles. So, here's the trillion-dollar question: Is there truly a frontier where AI outgrows its automation roots, or are we just indulging in tech fantasies?

The thing is I actually have decent experience to share - been in UX design for 5 years, worked on some cool projects, have opinions about design trends and accessibility that I think could add value. But every time I go to post something I freeze up because it feels like everyone's already said everything and why would anyone care what I have to say when there's already established design influencers with hundreds of thousands of followers.

Also struggling with the whole authenticity vs professional balance.

Is it weird to start commenting on other people's posts when I have no presence myself?

The platforms are overwhelming too. Obviously LinkedIn for professional stuff but then there's Twitter/X for design discourse, Instagram for visual portfolio pieces, maybe TikTok? Feels like I need to be everywhere at once but that's literally a full time job on top of my actual job.

1n8zz5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/1n8zz5f/what_is_praxeology/,What is praxeology?,"From chatgpt:


Praxeology is one of those words that sounds intimidating, but in Austrian economics it really boils down to a simple claim: economics is the study of human action, and that action is purposeful.

The idea was developed most fully by Ludwig von Mises in the 20th century. He argued that if we want to understand the economy, we have to start with the undeniable fact that people act with intent. You don’t need a lab or survey to prove it—you only need to recognize that every choice we make implies we’re trying to achieve some end with some means.

From that starting axiom—humans act—Austrians think you can logically deduce a whole structure of economic truths. A few examples:

Action implies preference. If I choose to drink coffee instead of tea this morning, I’ve revealed that coffee is preferred at that moment. That preference may change later, but the act itself demonstrates a ranking of options.

Exchange implies mutual gain. In voluntary trade, both sides expect to benefit. If I give you $5 for a sandwich, I value the sandwich more than the $5, and you value the $5 more than the sandwich. Both walk away better off, at least in expectation.

Money has historical roots. Praxeological reasoning leads Austrians to argue that money must have originated as a commodity that already had direct value (like gold or silver), because otherwise nobody would have accepted it in exchange.


Notice what’s going on here: praxeology isn’t trying to measure how many sandwiches are sold, or whether coffee demand will rise 3% next year. It’s not statistical prediction. It’s about uncovering the logical structure behind economic behavior.

This is where Austrians diverge sharply from mainstream economics. In most universities, econ is taught as a social science that borrows heavily from math and statistics. The dominant method is to build formal models of supply and demand, unemployment, inflation, etc., and then test those models with data—regressions, experiments, randomized trials, you name it.

Mises and later Austrians like Murray Rothbard pushed back hard against that. Their critique: humans aren’t like molecules that obey physical laws. People have intentions, plans, and subjective values. You can’t rerun history in a lab to see what “would have happened” if the Fed set interest rates differently in 2008. Statistical averages often blur the very thing you’re trying to understand: the purposeful decisions of individuals.

For Austrians, then, economics is more like logic or geometry than physics. Just as you can deduce that the sum of a triangle’s angles is 180° without measuring every triangle in the world, you can deduce certain economic laws—like “price ceilings cause shortages”—without running experiments. If the price is legally fixed below the level where supply and demand would meet, more people will want the good than producers are willing to supply. That follows from the logic of action.

Of course, this approach has plenty of critics. Mainstream economists often argue that praxeology risks being too detached from reality. If you don’t confront your theories with data, how do you know they’re actually useful? How do you distinguish between sound logical deduction and just-so stories? Austrians respond that data can describe history but never generate universal laws, because every dataset is influenced by countless uncontrolled factors. For them, “empirical testing” in economics is often just measuring unique historical events, not establishing general rules.

Where things get interesting is how Austrians combine praxeology with economic history. They’ll use praxeological reasoning to identify the structure of cause-and-effect (say, why inflation distorts price signals and investment decisions), and then look to history to illustrate how those effects played out in particular times and places. In other words: theory tells you what must happen in principle, history shows you how it happened in practice.

So when you see Austrians talk about praxeology, think of it as their foundation stone. It’s the claim that economics isn’t just a branch of applied math or a playground for statistical models, but a logical science of human choice. Whether you find that compelling or frustrating probably depends on whether you think economics should aim for the predictive precision of physics, or whether it’s more like philosophy: reasoning through the inescapable truths of how humans behave when faced with scarcity.

She was an odd cat, which drew us to her instantly. She was the only kitty at the rescue in her own cage, as she was half the size of a normal cat and hated other animals. She was slightly cross eyed, and had a bit of a limp from a previous injury, and to top it off she was a female tabby. My partner could not stop holding and petting her and I knew it was the perfect cat for us. She traveled with us across the country through law school, getting engaged, new jobs, and was always the perfect weird little companion. 

Four years later, we just got married and are overseas for our honeymoon. One of my bridesmaids lives next door, so she was watching her while we were gone. She noticed labored breathing and took her in only to find out she had aggressive cancer. The vet was very sad and certain even with treatment, she wouldn’t last more than a few agonizing painful weeks. She was completely normal and playing leading up, as my friend sent daily pictures and videos and she looked so normal. It was so sudden and absolutely devastating news. 

We said goodbye over the phone literally a world away and I feel so horrible I couldn’t be there to hold her and give her a final kiss. We have no idea how we are supposed to celebrate and enjoy this trip while knowing she won’t be there to greet us once we go home. We are nearly done, but it will be a very long travel (over 24 hours) to get home, and it just all feels awful and the worst timing and I feel so guilty. 

We are going to try and find a place to make us a Cortado, and cheers to the time we were able to spend with her, but I am just so distraught and sad. ",7,1757062136.0,Petloss,1,1.0,False

1n8zwdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1n8zwdd/they_say_im_fine/,they say i'm fine,"The ai and medical articles and what i go through, they all say i have a drinking problem, more precisely an alcoholic. But i'm a 20 year-old girl. And i don't and didn't use to drink daily like a typical one. People don't really get it and underestimate the situation. Some maybe even think i try to look cool when i say i quitted alcohol. (try to quit honestly) 
I used to get drunk to the limit like 1-2 times a week. Also drunk but not to the limit like 2-3 times a week. I was small and my family don't drink so it was hidden as much as possible. And money was an issue. And i was in high school, i had plenty of responsibilities, i didn't have that freedom. So i didn't seem like an alcoholic. 

My time and money, all planned around drinking. I got booze with me anywhere i couldn't buy it, even if i probably won't be able to drink there, i needed to have it with me. The way i drink was a big problem. I drink cheap and as fast as i can. Because taking it slow means wasting the money and the liquid for me. I drank glasses of cocktails and wine as they were shots. This was my favourite, i was addicted to the 'hit' feeling. I did never like drinking a little, tipsy-drunkish, have fun and i didn't get it when people do. 

I didn't drink for fun or socializing. Actually if I was having fun I preferred not to drink because I wanted to fully experience and remember these moments which were rare. I had a close friend group which we drank regularly. I drank alone a lot, which was not really common for our age as I found out later. I drank to forget that I didn't want to live honestly, (not wanting to live and wanting to die are indeed different if you know you know) and that friend group was a place that we could openly talk about these feelings, unhappiness and pain, we listen and got each other. Not all of us were the same but it was like that. 

It made me feel like i found something i had lost long ago. Even the first time I got drunk, the feeling was somehow familiar. It's the second ever time i've drunk. And by the third time it was already habitual. So it got really fast. And the famous group was gathered later, it wasn't started in it. 

I still could be functional when i was drunk as hell. I could get me home safe, not get dangerous attention as a teen drunk girl on the street at 11 pm, take the right train and bus in the right time. After i put the key in the keyhole, i got loose and not remember after. I used to go straight to the bathroom then bedroom to sleep, actually passing out, without facing my parents. And in the mornings i would be very fresh and joyful, only lack of water, not hungover at all, maybe bc i was young. 

Very key moments of my life those years... Graduation, first kiss, first sexual experiences, most of the moments with my best friends and first boyfriend i didn't actually love and all the yearnings for the boys that i fell in love... I am drunk in all of these. My friend group was alcoholic. All we did as an activity was to plan and make hangouts which surely include alcohol. Beer, malt liquor, wine and votka or gin. When i was told later, that mixing alcohol like this is a very bad idea, i was shocked. That was all we do. 

And then my health, stomach and gut issues. I didnt think that they were from alcohol. And I didn't care to the point I couldn't even drink tea. Tea is essential for me, I gave up on coffee and spicy food for alcohol but tea. 

I started to get really sick in the stomach after drinking. It lasted a day, two days then five days, a week and two weeks and then finally three weeks. I thought it was something natural like hangover. I didn't think alcohol was making me sick. I thought I should have waited for my body to recover from alcohol. Every time, the day after I felt better, I drank again. That was a huge mistake but thinking wasn't possible. All I knew was the heaven I felt. I couldn't possibly imagine feeling in paradise and getting sick at the same time. Me and my friends were kids and we were hiding most of our drinking so we couldn't get help. We weren't aware at all. We thought we were normal, we didn't have any comparison. People didn't talk openly about alcohol until university. 

I was 15 when I started, at 17 and 18 it became difficult to drink, i suffered a lot. I have months clean, but it was not that i don't drink, it was that i can't drink. That's a huge difference. It was on and off. Each time, i expected to get back. I never really could. Now in small amounts i have pretty bad rebouncing symptoms after the effect. Probably in big amounts too, but they come slow and in a longer period and mixed with gut issues that are already bad so i can't tell them well. And those rebounces get worse each time. Giving up on alcohol totally is still not an idea i could entirely accept. I tried a bit but no other drug or anything can replace it, they are not the same. At least i need to have a really really long break.

I’m trying to work out if it was always just coffee and a roll, or if that’s just what it became. You see the term pop up, but the details are maddeningly vague. Was it a proper menu item with a set price, or more of a default for the Europeans who couldn’t stomach a massive fry-up first thing?

What I’m really after are some solid examples from the time. An old hotel bill of fare, a mention in a travel guide, anything that lays out what you got and what it cost compared to a proper cooked breakfast. I'm especially curious about the big railway hotels – you’d think they’d have had this sort of thing down to a fine art for folks coming off the boat train.

I’ve had a dig through some old cookery books, but they’re more about what you’d do at home. It’s the hotel practice I’m stuck on. Did a place like the Savoy or a Great Western Railway hotel in the 1890s have a menu with ""Continental Breakfast: 1 shilling, Full English Breakfast: 2 shillings,"" or something to that effect?

It was my first time seeing them and it was right before they really took off...they were the openers! The Used was also playing that night and Bert came out to sing Prison with the band. Their energy was absolutely wild. I remember doing a double take with some of the things Gerard was saying and watching Frank bouncing around and rolling on the floor wondering what the hell he was doing.

1n8zto8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Internationalteachers/comments/1n8zto8/worklife_boundaries/,Work-Life Boundaries,"This is kind of an *unpopular opinion post*, but also something I find genuinely interesting. 

Since I got into education, I have been a little surprised by the culture of work-life “boundary setting”. I totally understand and fully support the reasons why, 

* Digital detox. 
* Work-life balance. 
* Reduced burnout.
* Respectful boundaries culture. 

Having said that, as someone who comes from a different profession, sometimes, for me, it can come across like you guys literally hate your job, and from 9-5 your life is a torturous misery and TGIF and please please don’t remind me of the fact that I have a job when I’m not in work.

It’s not a criticism at all.  I admire it. But also, for me the best discussions I have, the best brainstorming, the best “transformative ideas” come from those informal unstructured chats after hours. Reflecting on the previous week in a social, relaxed setting. Sharing grievances over tapas, problem solving in the pub, sharing successes, sharing amusing stories. Discussing long-term goals and ambitions for your program. Having those big picture discussions that you just don't have time for in your busy work day.

Again, I’m not saying that I’m right, and they are wrong. I’m just saying that when someone puts their fingers in their ears and screams “lah lah lah” as the topic of work comes up in conversation, it’s a little strange for me to get used to.

I’m from a sports coaching background. We would always gather for a Sunday morning coffee or a Saturday evening beer and talk about player development, training plans, player performances, aspirations for the team, new ideas for strategies and tactics, our philosophies of play (see “principles of practice” for the education equivalent). We shared ideas and information. It didn't feel like work. It was our passion and we loved nothing more than to talk about it.

I just find it an interesting observation that the culture in education is so different. ",4,1757061572.0,Internationalteachers,23,0.6,False

Rhythmic Accuracy","Researchers from SUPSI, IDSIA, and Politecnico di Milano have developed Robot Drummer, a humanoid robot capable of playing complex drum patterns with human-like timing and expression. Using the Unitree G1 humanoid robot in simulation, the team translated music into “rhythmic contact chains” — precisely timed sequences of drum strikes. 

Over time, the robot learned advanced techniques such as stick switching, cross-arm hits, and movement optimisation, achieving over 90% rhythmic precision on tracks from jazz to rock and metal, including pieces by Linkin Park, Dave Brubeck, and Bon Jovi.  
  
The project, sparked by a casual coffee conversation, explores the underdeveloped role of humanoid robots in creative arts. Future plans include moving from simulation to real hardware and adding improvisation so the robot can adapt to live performances in real time.

When I turn the knob to grind finer, I get a grinding noise at some point, is that the 0-point? I was wondering, since it isn't a uniform noise: there seems to be some wobbling going on (see video). Is that to be expected?

Also: I yesterday found the [Honest Coffee grind size chart](https://honestcoffeeguide.com/coffee-grind-size-chart/) for the Eureka Mignon Specialia (or any recent Eureka Mignon, I guess) and was a bit startled: It shows a range of multiple rotations of the knob for espresso style! I barely move the knob when dialing in: I only use a range of \~45 degrees (though I only use older, medium roasted beans). Is that normal? I was wondering if I might grind too fine, but anything coarser shoots the 45g out in only a few seconds.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences.

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis. The narrative danced to the beat of onomatopoeic creativity, transforming the mundane into a dynamic celebration of city life.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed—a pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals. Its impact rippled through the lives of citizens, shaping their destinies in ways they could scarcely fathom.

Through the lens of metonymy, I delved into the layers of meaning hidden within this political shorthand. The characters grappled not only with the literal implications of the Iron Throne Statement but also with the overarching themes of power, ambition, and the sacrifices demanded by political gamesmanship.

The story immersed itself in the world of clichés, where the seemingly predictable phrases became living entities with the power to alter reality. As characters grappled with the clichés that defined their lives, they discovered that beneath the familiarity lay profound truths and unexpected consequences.

Through the lens of cliché, I explored the characters' journey to navigate the clichéd landscapes of their existence.

😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1757061032.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

I recently discovered **The Barn** in La Soukra, and honestly, it’s a really cozy coworking space. Fast Wi-Fi, comfy desks, lots of plants, chess boards, books, and free coffee & snacks — the little things that make working actually enjoyable.

The thing is… it doesn’t get that many visitors yet, and I feel like more people would really enjoy it if they knew about it. Flexible passes, from day passes to monthly or even dedicated desks, and a really chill vibe overall.

I've bought a Breville (in Europe its called Sage) Barista Touch Impress in July and I have a few questions:

1. According to the user manual, the machine tells me when it needs maintenance (e.g., cleaning the grinder or cleaning with the cleaning tablet). However, there has been no request for this yet. Should I proactively run the programs?

2. I would like to make individual espresso shots, but of course there are problems with the double spout. I can't find any portafilter with only one spout online. Does anyone have any tips? The Touch Impress only has a diameter of 54 mm. 

3. It is recommended to use the double-walled inserts for older coffee and the other ones for newer coffee. However, I have great difficulty knocking out the coffee grounds from the double-walled inserts. Does anyone else have a similar problem?

thanks a lot for your support :-)

But that’s been changing over the past few years and now I even have a go-to spot: **SLOTH COFFEE ROASTERS**.

📍 [Google Maps link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SrTxP2i2ZHi7Genb6)

The space is surprisingly big (which is rare in Osaka, where many great coffee spots are either take-out only or tiny). They’re roasters, and they also serve decent pastries **special mention for their tiramisu**, which I really enjoyed.

It’s a solid place to grab a good coffee and chill for a bit. It might get crowded on weekends, but I’ve always managed to find a seat, even on Saturday afternoons.

If you’ve got other favorite spots near Umeda, feel free to share them!

But I can't shake the feeling that the coffee scoop is too large, since the coffee has always been too strong. I know you can just add hot water after the pour.
