1ph59ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ph59ax/aitah_for_feeling_kinda_angry_about_mocha/,AITAH for feeling kinda angry about mocha,"Okay this is a totally small matter. But idk why I’m kinda angry but trying my best to calm myself right now. 

So I bought a mocha from a coffee shop, I told the staff multiple times that I don’t want any added sugar at all. They said okay. I even ask about added sugar in the soy milk, they said the soy milk has no added sugar. Okay. I bought the mocha, waited, and then drank it. It tastes VERY sweet, I can tell right away. 

Now for some context, I’m pre-diabetic, has a strong family history of diabetes from my father’s side, and am trying to stay away from added sugar. So it’s really important for me to not have any added sugar in my diet. 

So I went to the staff and ask again, “are you sure there’s no sugar? I can’t have sugar for my health. This is very sweet.” Then and only then they said “oh we have sugar in the chocolate pump, and I add 2 pumps for you since you ordered soy milk”. I looked at the staff with this bewildered look on my face. They knew I don’t want sugar at all, I even ask about the milk. Maybe it’s my fault for not knowing that coffee shops use sweet chocolate pumps for their mocha idk, but maybe just tell me that there is sugar anyway since I make it clear MULTIPLE times I don’t want ANY sugar? And why do they even use twice the pump? 

So anyway I just looked at them and say “it’s fine” since I don’t want to be angry at a service worker, most of them are underpaid and overworked. But as I throw the drink away, I can’t help but to feel kinda angry. The drink was not cheap and I can only have a sip. So now I’m just calming myself down and ranting on the internet. 

Idk.

1ph596f,https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/1ph596f/i_have_an_idea_for_a_new_faction_but_i_wanna_make/,"I have an idea for a new faction, but i wanna make sure it sticks with the all scp tone.","So, some time ago i saw ""Just girly things"" and like the idea of a hiper femenine faction. And i remember an idea i always found funny, but never materialize because i don't want to be treated as soft porn. Which is the combination of a genius woman with a bimbo aesthetic, i always found hilarious the idea of someone you don't spect to actually follow anything you are saying from nowhere starting to spill out scientific facts a the most bubbly way possible, almost if she was mocking at you and how you saw her. So i came up with this: An order of scientist (being guided by woman, but who also accept men on their organization), that pursue beauty as the the essence of humanity, and so, their main goal is cover the world with love using SCP either to be more beautyfull, helping people finding love like an industrial Cupid organization, and directly modify their bodies to ""bring humanity to the next stage off beuty"", which is a fancy way to say they make sure their girls have as well the figure of bombshells and models, supernatural the strenght, and the thinking of a supercomputer. This is by the philosophy of ""A sharp mind is just as beautifull as a killer bod"" and ""Being beauty shouldn't be an excuse to sleep in class"". They called their members after variations of goddess mixed with common names like ""Tiamaty"", ""Artemchelle"" or ""Isusan"". The same goes for the Masculine members, which are more rare, and mainly enter because there was an active investigation, or because a former member wanted to working with her husband (they have gay and bi members, but that is for another day). They would be on disguise like the foundation, but always with a theme of cosmetic products like a perfume store, or love places like date sites, and in some cases a gym or a valentine chocolate coffee shop. Now they thing i like about this is that they would see the foundation with some admiration for the historically research of SCP, but ultimatly, they would kinda play with them, having a member basically send to the foundation door with the condition of being treated more as an guest. Acting almost like a normal SCP doctor and blending with the staff with and terryfing ease, making some theorise if one of her habilities is actually foul people into believeing she is one of the group she is living with. And this member/scp will also came up with an official presentation card explaining some vital information and inviting to the foundation into an alliance to empowering humanity and ending the suffering those hearts who never find love. Ah, and just for the sake of ""This faction really likes to messed up with the foundation"" the member on a recorded video will be shown it scaped with no help of anyone apparently, just teleporting or creating a pink portal and going to her containtment chamber just and when a Dr confront her about her breach she will response inocently with ""I am so sorry for not being avaliable for or ussual testing dr, but the girls needed my help back home, i hope you understand how inconvenient is having a group sanotaging the foundation. Like that... what was it?, The Chaos Brotherhood?""

Dr: Ths Chaos Insurge- wait, how do you know about them? did your organization ever fought against them?

The girl: No silly!, dr [censored] told me the other day!

Dr: DR [censored], WE SAID DON'T SHARE INFORMATION WITH HER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE!


So any way. What do you think so far about the concept?, i hope it diference enoght from the other groups of interest.

1ph56nj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1ph56nj/how_do_i_forget_the_bags/,How do I Forget the Bags?,"My mom would tell me she felt an obligation to Aunt Lily because they were close growing up. Lily had a difficult time with money, and was the sole caretaker for a son from her divorce. Isaac was twenty-three and couldn’t live on his own. After Lily stopped taking him to his appointments he talked less and put on weight. I remember the footbaths Lily would set up for him while he watched TV. He’d soak there for hours, making the whole living room smell like epsom salt and skin.

I spent a lot of time at aunt Lily’s house. Isaac had a habit of collecting garbage in various containers. His largest repository was of empty tissue boxes, taking up nearly three whole plastic tubs near the fridge. If you touched them he would refuse to move for several hours. The loft was the only place that Isaac wouldn’t stash things. It was a simple room with a guest mattress. I didn’t like to sleep on it because it sometimes had weird stains. My mom let me play Wii up there while she and Lily talked. Our visits started becoming more frequent. Eventually we started going every Saturday.

Lily came up to the loft once. She sat very close to me on the bed and started telling me about her medicine. The smell of rancid coffee on her breath was distracting. She pressed a small brown glass bottle into my hand. There was a clear liquid inside which she said to drink a capful of every day. I showed it to my mom when we got home. Worry flashed on her face and she told me aunt Lily had different ideas about medicine that weren’t necessarily true. She said that even if Lily talked like she knew what was right, that only doctors who’d been to medical school had the knowledge to diagnose and prescribe remedies properly. Taking things that Lily gave me could be dangerous. I don’t know what she did with the bottle.

Our visits kept up for two more years and I graduated middle school. My mom got me a few Pokemon booster packs as congratulations. One of them contained a shiny Charizard, which became my most prized possession. I put it in a plastic sleeve and would take it with me places just so I could look at it. Around this time, Isaac’s complexion started to turn a shade of gray. The smell of whatever Lily rubbed on him stopped wearing off. I’d catch him walking out of the loft as I went up sometimes, sweating and breathing heavily.

I brought Charizard with me on my last visit to Lily’s. I was admiring it in an attempt to ignore the rumbling in my stomach. Aunt Lily only had PB&Js which I had grown tired of months ago. Eventually my hunger tore my eyes away from the card regardless. I left it on the bed as I went downstairs.

It took me a while to realize that Lily was out of peanut butter. Navigating Isaac’s various collections slowed my search. I heard his heavy footsteps on the stairs up to the loft as I opened another cupboard. A minute or two later, as I slathered two slices of white bread with a generous helping of grape jelly, I heard my mom call up to me. She was upstairs and hadn’t realized I was in the kitchen. Before I could respond, she started to yell my name a second time but stopped short.

Her footsteps raced down the stairs. She grabbed me by the arm and yanked me away from my sandwich fixings. I tried to ask her what was going on, but the look on her face silenced me immediately. I’d never seen her eyes so wide. As we raced out the door she mumbled a lie about a work project to aunt Lily which only confused me more. In the commotion I didn’t get a chance to go get Charizard.

I wanted to ask my mom about what happened on the drive home, make her turn around so I could go get my card, but her pursed lips and fixed stare intimidated me. In the end I said nothing. After that day whenever Aunt Lily would call, my mom would make an excuse as to why we couldn’t go over. It took about a week for Lily to stop reaching out. Whenever I tried to bring up her or Isaac, my mom’s face would grow dark and her responses would get kurt. I learned to stop prying.

Two months later Isaac died. They said it was a heart attack. At the funeral Aunt Lily kept opening and closing her mouth. Her teeth hitting each other made this awful noise. My mom didn’t look at her. Lily went to stay with friends on the east coast. It was supposed to be temporary, but I never saw her again.

A friend offered me sixty dollars for my shiny Charizard recently. It was the first time I’d thought about it since my last visit to aunt Lily’s. I knew my mom kept a spare key. Part of me was screaming to not go, but I was saving up for an Xbox and I wanted that money. I waited for my mom to leave for work that weekend. As soon as I was alone I took the key from its dresser drawer and got on my bike.

The house stood silent and unchanged since I had last been there. On the ride over a terrible weight settled in my stomach. I had pushed it down somewhat, but I couldn’t hold it back anymore when I tried the front door handle and found it unlocked. 

Isaac’s garbage was still neatly piled in the living room: Cigarette butts, used coffee filters, empty lotion bottles. Something dripped from the bottom of the fridge door into a murky puddle on the linoleum. An oppressive feeling washed over me. I felt watched, judged. I made my way to the stairs.

With the electricity off, the light of the overcast afternoon outside was all there was to see by. It colored the walls and carpets gray. The stairs ascended into darkness. I turned on my phone flashlight before going up.

I paused before the last five steps to the loft. The feeling in my stomach grew heavier. I hadn’t gone high enough to see into the room, the window was the only thing visible to me. Dust hung in the air. It took a lot of courage to push myself forward. I stopped on the penultimate step.

The mattress was covered with a wide sickly yellow stain. I didn’t see my Charizard where I’d left it. My heart started pounding in my ears. As soon as I stopped holding my breath I noticed the smell.

It was thick, invading my nostrils, making my eyes water. I’d never experienced anything like it before: Chlorine air from a stagnant pool, sweat, sink mold. 

There was a plain paper grocery bag in the corner. Top folded down, its sides bulged; overfull. Another identical bag sat next to it, but this one was still open. The stench emanated from them. I could almost see it in the air. Isaac had collected something in this room.

I biked home so fast that I could taste blood in my teeth. I couldn’t explain to my mom why I was crying when she got back. Now whenever I think about my time in that loft, the smell comes back to me. The bags I always just looked over burn into my memory. How do I forget them? How do I stop feeling sick?

But the NEXT DAY she showed up at my café with 3–4 friends and basically announced that I’d be reading for everyone. No heads-up, no asking, nothing. Just assumed I’d drop everything at my own business to work for free.

I wasn’t rude. I just said:
“Sure! Here’s my price list let me know what kind of session each of you wants.”

Her face changed instantly.

She got annoyed and said I “shouldn’t charge friends,” that I was “gifted” so it should be free, and that I was being “greedy and inconsiderate.” Keep in mind… I’ve always charged everyone upfront. She was the ONLY person I had ever read for without payment.

I told her calmly that my time and energy are still work, and I don’t give out full sessions for free, especially not to a group I’ve never met.

She got mad, said I’ve “changed,” stormed out, and later texted me paragraphs about how selfish I’ve become before blocking me.

Ironically, TWO of her friends came back afterward, apologized, paid for their sessions, and were completely respectful.

1ph4vgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/statusAI/comments/1ph4vgm/disappointment/,disappointment,"i'm really disappointed with this app. i was one of the first person to use it because i found it on tiktok. it's sad to see the downfall of this app because i really thought that it had the potential. 

  
i don't blame the devs for having a paid subscription or for lowering the daily actions. i get it. it's expensive. why would you (as the dev) pay just to keep an app running or not make any money. the way i understood their message, their profits are in the negatives. if you are making a loss so you're asking for people to pay, it makes sense. i would be more outraged if they were already making money, but wanted more. 

regarding what they said a while ago about how the app is going to have unlimited actions, once again, i'm disappointed but not surprised. i didn't expect them to do it because from a business standpoint, why would you give something for free when you can make people pay for it (eg. coffees)? plus, they thought that the AI model that they're using would soon be free. i don't blame them for promising unlimited actions but being unable to deliver because forecasting isn't always accurate, especially for something that is rapidly changing, like AI.

what i'm most disappointed by is the attitude of the devs and mods. the app has bugs, which, sure, not really a problem to me. it's annoying, but i can still use the app and have fun with it. it would be great if they could fix it. however, what they did is giving updates and features that no one really asked for. shouldn't you fix the issues before adding more features? decorations are pretty, but the foundation needs to be solid. i don't pretend to know how to run an app or do coding or anything, but it feels like when they add a new feature instead of fixing the existing issue, they're doing it just to shut us up. 

i'm also not a fan of how they basically stopped communicating and even deleted posts and comments talking about the subscription or complaining. that is absolutely ridiculous. you are now a business, not an individual. you should be able to handle criticisms and customers not liking your product. it is essentially the same as a company deleted 1 star reviews. i remember when the devs used to give updates on discord and it felt like they were listening, but now, it feels like they have abandoned this app and no longer care. and when they DO reply, they're being passive aggressive. 

another thing that disappointed me is how they do not really care about feedback. lots of people have said that they don't mind having ads or even using the lower-quality AI models. people love this app and they just wanna keep using it. people were giving alternatives and suggestions. i understand if they were not good ideas because i don't doubt that some of them don't actually understand how much it would actually cost, but like i said, it feels like they aren't listening and are preparing to jump ship.

i really had high hopes for this app. i thought that it was a really interesting idea and i had fun 'interacting' with characters through tweets and events. i hope that either in the future, this app goes back to the way it was, or there will be another app like this.

He received a mail to file his nomination for this new position six months ago, before filing he discussed it with his wife Grace, new position was bringing more money on table but less time around but after discussion they both agreed that savings are important for their future and kids’ education she agreed to be ok with his less involvement in household and kids’ activities for some time.

So, Mark went ahead with the promotion initially things were going well Boys and Grace were understanding his work commitments still sharing their study and games updates with him but he started noticed that from past one month no one was engaging with him , he was just receiving updates through shared Calander, no one was interested in asking when he was coming home any weekend plans or will he be able to join their game sessions. Still he felt it was his fault for not being able to be around more ,he was still his thoughts when he checked the calendar and saw there was a soccer game today, he decided to give surprise to his family and left the work early. On the way he bought flowers for grace and boys favorite donuts , when he reached the venue he searched for Grace near the stands where all moms were sitting but she was not there as looked around he saw her standing with Jack her coworker they were standing close to each other ,laughing at something and she leaned to whisper something in his ear which was enough for a husband to watch not interested in making a scene there Mark went back to his car and waited for his kids. After the game ended his boys arrived with Grace and Jack, they all were laughing, looked like a family, boys were showing their game tricks to Jack, suddenly a realization hit Mark that he has been replaced by his family he was just a wallet for them now to pay bills and activities no one missed him. It was strange how his own family has cut him out of their life while he working for their future exhausting his physical and mental health. Heartbroken he drove off from there before anybody could see him, he went through the flowers and donuts in kitchen bin and packed his important documents and some clothes in a suitcase, before leaving he looked around the house once and was about to leave a note on fridge out of habit but soon he realized note for whom no one was missing him. Then he went to the garage took his fishing kit and drove off to lake cabin, he  was halfway when his phone buzzed for first time it was Grace calling him he didn’t answer then she called again and again , than started message where are you , did you came home why did you through flowers in bin are you ok I was out for boys game please call back, mark didn’t respond for next two days he didn’t checked any of her messages and voicemails he didn’t need to listen to any of lies and explanations how his family has replaced him within six months even after a long discussion about securing their future , it was a wake up call for Mark regarding his physical and mental health also he was not eating properly has gained some weight and was getting anxious over work stress. He called his boss and told him that he is taking some personal time and will report in 3 days to which his boss agreed because he has seen Mark working diligently for projects irrespective of work hours during all these years.

He spent these two days just with himself how he has lost himself living and providing for others, he understood how important its to put yourself first in life if you are happy, living life than you can be with others so he decided that from now on his first most priority is his health and happiness rest everything and everyone comes after. He thought about Grace and Jack their closeness and his boys how they were treating him as a male figure in their life but surprisingly he was not feeling hurt now he was just done , he thought about divorce but remember how cruel the system is for men , his friends wife has cheated on him and had walked away with more than half of his hard earned earnings , the house and kids poor fellow was still paying alimony and child support, so divorce was out of options so he decided to become like them be different if they can make him feel invisible he can do the same with them .

On third day he returned home around noon he chose this time because he knew Grace will be at work and boys at school , he went bedroom upstairs looked at their bed which he was now never going to share with Grace, he took a photo and post it online for sale within an hour a buyer was at his door because the price was 10 dollars  and help to assemble a new beds which has just arrived who  can miss it. Before coming back Mark has ordered set of two beds we see in hotels for his bedroom he assembled those with help of the buyer, next he shifted his home office to basement which till now boys were using for their movie nights he brought the TV upstairs kept it in old office and that’s how he started crafting his man cave in his house in basement, basically he was trying to distant himself from them so that he doesn’t have to run into any of them during ant time of the day, he called his old buddy Garry to help him organize the basement put a new digital lock on basement door and locked it before going out for dinner and drinks with Garry.

Grace and boys arrived just at time was pulling back on driveway Grace called him out but he drove away without looking at them or pretending not to notice them, Garry asked is everything ok, mark said as long as money is flowing everyone is fine. He ate dinner had some drinks with Garry telling him a brief of what had happened Garry laughed that’s the problem man they want more of everything more time, more money but never realize how much provider is suffering in this stretching, this has story of every household now resulting in rise in divorces and depression, be strong man hold yourself together don’t let anyone play with your feelings and money remember one thing no relation in life is more important than you your wife can leave you ,kids will go away but its you who has to live with yourself at the end so keep yourself happy do whatever you want stop caring for others provide for basics no premium treatments and if need someone talk to I am always there so is our whole group who all still wait for you during our hiking trips. 

Although Mark has thought about all these things but listening from someone else gave him more confidence about his decision. He reached home around 11pm as entered the door Grace was sitting on counter with her laptop she looked at him and said can we talk, Mark replied there is nothing left to talk and went upstairs without even looking at her, this behavior coming from Mark was new for her she was used to have everything under control, she followed him to the bedroom and closed the door behind her then she started saying what’s going on you came home ,threw flowers and donuts in bin and then left without saying anything no contact for two days no answers why, what’s going on and now today all of sudden you change beds in bedroom and locked the basement don’t you think to explain. Mark looked at her smiled and said no I don’t think I need to explain because I am not asking for explanations from anyone for many things that I are happening in this house and to make it clearer this is my house I can change whatever I want if anybody has problems is free to leave. Grace stood there shocked to what he was saying because he never talked to her this way ever than he turned again and said one more thing do whatever shit you want to do out of this house and don’t dare to bring any garbage inside my house I won’t tolerate that any further and now please let me sleep I have work tomorrow, he turned of the light and went to sleep.

Grace stood there in dark trying to process what was happening but somewhere in her mind she already knew how she had let her believe herself that keeping Jack near her and kids was harmless as long as Mark was unaware she had both worlds in control but now she has lost it, she sat at edge of her bed how simple flirting with Jack has turned into something else which she could have stopped at any point but didn’t because she was enjoying the attention which Mark was not giving her but she always knew in her mind that she was the one who supported Mark for promotion for more money and has betrayed him most cruel manner. She realized now the weight of actions each word coming from his mouth was truth hitting her like an arrow but she still wanted him to yell at her ask why, how long or even divorce her but he was not doing any of that instead he had totally shut down. Next morning she wake up to see Mark has already left for work she made breakfast for the kids, they asked about Mark and what he said about basement she told her dad has left for work and he is setting up office in basement so they should not interfere.

At office Mark went with his work as a normal day but made it clear to his team that he taking efficiency and work life balance very seriously from now on so no more after office hours meetings for him or anybody in that case. He came home 7 after so many months and was surprised that he managed to complete all the meeting in working hours only, as he entered the front door he saw boys doing their school work and Grace was cooking dinner he said hi to the boys totally ignored Grace and went to change clothes after taking shower he came down was about to open basement when Grace called for dinner he said no thanks and closed the basement door behind him. After opening his home laptop first thing he did was to cancel all the unnecessary premium subscriptions to all the accounts , he canceled the premium spa sessions, book reading sessions for Grace and special soccer sessions for boys and their premium indoor kids gym subscription and added one line in remarks in shared calendar from now on only basic needs will be taken care of if someone wants special treatment then treat for yourself, message was clear. Then he routed his salary payments from joint account to his personal account and took out excess balance from there only left enough for basic groceries and emergencies.

Next morning when he was about to leave for work Grace stood in door and said are you punishing everyone by cutting on everything Mark answered ii am just providing that enough that should be excepted from an invisible man in house, and what about the balance in joint account why its so low how will I manage Mark looked at her and said as you said its joint I have made my contribution it will increase once you put in your share, Grace looked at him with surprised and said why are so bitter you never cared about this before , Mark smiled and said you are right I never cared until I realized that my own money was used on family dates with someone else to replace me from my own house and then he left the room leaving Grace to face the consequences of her actions alone. Coming days were same Mark was distant he had made his own routine where there was space for any of them except some family get together , neighbors barbeques where he played the role of perfect father and husband he was also mastering the skill of pretending now. He never asked Grace about Jack or tried to check texts or mails or hire any PI because he didn’t need to she was a stranger to him now sharing his home till wants to he was ready to face the day she will move out actually he didn’t care because for him she had already gone the day he first saw them both at soccer game. He renovated the basement according to his needs a small kitchen, a coffee maker, poker table for buddies’ nights a comfortable couch and a big screen for game nights he was also living his life now and he felt so light and relieved, on weekends he had his own plans for hiking, cycling or fishing. Boys were noticing everything and suddenly interested in his whereabouts and activities ,they would ask Grace if dad is free why he not coming for our games but she couldn’t answer because answering them will mean telling them how she and in a manner they had also cheated on their dad by giving his space to Jack who was out of picture now because flaunting exotic brunches and soccer sessions at Marks expense was thrill but he was inserted in spending his  own money once money stopped flowing.

Grace thought she would enjoy both lives as long as she can but now was facing reality she could have divorced him but on what ground he was playing his role perfectly in front of everyone else just like her and chances of digging grave if her own infidelity were very high so she also accepted the new normal at home. Soon boys started to give attention to Mark which he responded they requested him to take them to hikes and other activities and he agreed took them he provided everything for them because they were kids don’t know what wrong was happening at that time. Mark and kids were rebuilding their relation but he never looked at Grace again , never gave her chance to blame him for her deeds, he only communicated through share expense sheet, he never forgave her and to be honest shouldn’t have cheaters don’t deserve forgiveness, your attention, your money. Mark decided not to divorce her until kids went to college, after the younger one went to college he sat with both boys and told them the truth boys looked at surprised and said all these years you tolerated her because of us , dad you deserve best in your life do what you feel to do . so after nearly a decade of cheating Mark finally took divorce from Grace all these years he had planned his finances very wisely making sure she couldn’t claim more then what she deserves from his hard-earned money , he sat with his lawyer and Grace to decide an amount for final settlement which Grace declined to his surprise saying I wont take anything from you , I know you suffering all the years for what I did I cannot undo the past but wont make you suffer more. That was their last talk in that house within a month Grace shifted to a small apartment which Mark gave her as settlement for all these years sake and the whole house was so big for a single person without kids mark sold the house bought an RV and started travelling .

1ph4qz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1ph4qz8/my_male_cats_behavior_has_been_moody_aggressive/,"My male cat’s behavior has been moody, aggressive, and unpredictable since I stepped on his tail two months ago.","Hi everyone. I'm a 26 year old cat owner living in the US. I have a two year old male cat named Sammy, raised as a stray kitten, and neutered at 8 months old. I found him under an abandoned car as a baby, emaciated and severely dehydrated. He needed formula, but he survived, and is currently healthy, pampered, and extremely loved. All has been well up until these past two months. 

It was about 9pm when I accidentally stepped on his tail, and he let out a horrific scream. It wasn’t a hiss or a growl, it sounded like an Aztec death whistle. After I stepped on his tail, he chased me into my kitchen, hissing, swatting, and growling. I was terrified but I didn’t want to hurt him, so I separated myself from him with my trashcan until he calmed down (no airplane ears, no growling, no crouching, no swatting, etc). He avoided me for a few hours, and eventually allowed me to pet and play with him. After the accident, he's been consistently stalking and attacking me throughout my home. His behavior flips between sweet, cuddly, and affectionate - to deep growling, swatting, and charging. I think it is triggered by my walking, since he's never shown aggression with me sitting on the ground and on my furniture. Sometimes I'll be able to catch it and stop before he gets too aggressive. But most times, Sammy will approach and/or chase without warning, swatting and growling until he becomes docile again.

He’s attempted to attack me everywhere in my house at least once, though normally in the living room area. The most recent incident was earlier this night, when I was sitting in my living room. Sammy was next to me, laying on the ground. I got up, collected my laptop and charger, and I saw him crawl under my coffee table. When I got halfway across the living room, he tried sneaking up behind me. I caught him and he began growling, crouching down low, and deeply murmuring, like how it normally starts. I immediately froze, slowly put my laptop and charger on the floor, and I waited. It took several minutes for him to calm down, and allow me to go upstairs to my bedroom. This was a tame incident, as he’s lunged, scratched, and backed me up into corners many times before. However, it always ends with him calming down, and then carrying on like nothing happened.

I’ve been to the vet and called about the situation already. I was told this reaction and behavior is generally normal for a cat who has experienced traumatic pain. His tail is not broken, and he does not have a history of violence prior to the accident. I know I need to be patient, but I can't help feeling like his behavior should have decreased or returned to normal by now. One minute he’s a sweet kitty who wants to play in his box and have booty pats. The next, he’s growling and charging. I tried different food brands, buying a new litter box, extra play time near the kitchen and stairs where I initially stepped on him, and with the advice of a friend, I’ve considered feline CBD oil. Cat diffusers are on the way but I have no clue if they’ll work in this circumstance. 

Has anyone else’s cat been through this? How do I repair my relationship with Sammy and earn his trust? He is food motivated but I’m worried treats will only train him to keep doing this. Catnip also does not work with Sammy (he’s completely uninterested!). Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.

**TLDR**: Male cat has been stalking and trying to attack me on and off since I stepped on his tail two months ago, and his behavior has not improved. Nothing appears to be medically wrong, and vet says this behavior is a normal trauma response. Home remedies so far haven't worked well and I'm not sure what to do - advice greatly appreciated.",1,1765173087.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False

1ph4ge9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1ph4ge9/i_explored_an_abandoned_hotel/,I Explored an Abandoned Hotel,"Before the horrors that took place at that hotel, my friends and I had been urban explorers. We had visited several abandoned malls, factories, and entire abandoned neighborhoods. We didn’t do it for money or for valuables that were left behind; we simply enjoyed seeing these structures that seemed to be completely abandoned at a moment's notice. Factories that still had machinery that hadn’t been moved since closing, malls with long abandoned stores with objects that had been left to gather dust. 



My two other friends were actually a couple, and I was their eternal third wheel, but we all had fun together. Merrisa and Justin had been together since pretty much kindergarten, and when I had met them in middle school, they both quickly took a liking to me, and we were soon inseparable from each other. It was in our junior year of high school when we started urban exploring at Justin’s behest. Our first building had been an abandoned house in the neighborhood. We climbed in through a broken window and entered the house, and I soon saw the appeal of it. 



It was a moment frozen in time. The family that had been evicted had been crackheads, and no one had wanted to buy the house, so it had sat for years. So many things had been left behind, and I was amazed by how surreal it felt. Merrisa wasn’t as excited at first, but soon she too fell under the spell. While the two lovebirds explored the upstairs, I stayed downstairs, walking over to the dresser, opening it, and I was amazed to find a photo of the family, in happier times, it seemed. I picked it up and stared at it, before looking around at the state of the house. Their whole life was preserved in this small snapshot. 



We didn’t take anything from the house, but from there, our new hobby was born. Every weekend, we would venture out and search for abandoned houses or properties to explore. We made sure that they were truly abandoned, and never once did we try to break into a property that someone clearly owned. We never made an entrance unless there was already one for us, be it a broken window, an open door, or no door at all. And we always made sure never to take anything, but we did document what we saw. 



We never uploaded any of the footage we used, it was purely for us. We acted stupidly, we told stupid inside jokes that only we knew about. And the most important thing for us, we had so much fun. Even into college, when we were unable to hang out as much, we still made sure to at least once a month, venture out to explore an abandoned property. I wish things could’ve stayed that way, but life had other intentions for the three of us. 



My grandparents were falling ill, and my parents had decided to move across several states to be closer to them, for emergencies, and if the day finally came that we would be needed to plan their funerals. With that, I would be moving away from my two best friends and continuing my studies at a different college. I was devastated, and hoped that there could be some way to stay close to Justin and Merrisa. But without my parents’ financial support, there was simply no way for me to afford an apartment and be a full-time student. Upon telling the couple, they were just as devastated, and the three of us began to think up elaborate ways for me to stay close to them, but they all came to nothing. So it was that two weeks before I was set to move away into some unknown future without them, that Justin texted in the group chat. 



He had found the perfect location for us to do one final exploration together. He kept it a secret from me, and Merrisa was only vaguely aware of where we were going. I was blown away that they were willing to skip that day of school, the two of them had perfect attendance records, just to do one last exploration with me. The plan was quickly drawn up, and the night before they arrived to pick me up, I began to pack my bag. I was bringing the essentials: a portable charger, a flashlight with plenty of backup batteries, a flare in case of emergencies, walkie-talkies, several granola bars, a first aid kit, and plenty of water. Justin always made fun of me for over-preparing, but I’ve always lived by the motto, better to have and not need than to not have and need. 



The morning of our last exploration, I woke up at the crack of dawn and exited out into the crisp morning air. There was a layer of fog just above the grass, and dew stuck to the blades of grass just outside my house. I exhaled gently and watched as my breath turned into steam. It wasn’t shockingly cold, since it was only mid-November, but it was chilly enough in the mornings to get a bit of steam to come out of my mouth. I took in the few minutes of pure silence that surrounded my neighborhood this early in the morning, until I heard a car pulling up to my driveway. 



Justin drove an old, beat-up Pontiac Grand Am, which we all affectionately called, the piece of shit. I was honestly surprised that it had lasted him this long, considering that he had started driving it the moment he got his driver’s permit. The old rust bucket came to a stop, and the doors immediately swung open. Quickly, Justin and Merrisa exited the car and ran over to me, giving me a tight hug and nearly tackling me to the floor with their combined weight. 



Justin was around my height, though he swore that he was taller than me constantly, even though we both measured about 5’8. A ginger with wild red curls, he was a ray of sunshine constantly. His freckled face always wore a smile, and he would do anything for his friends. He took my bag and quickly walked off to put it in the trunk with the rest of the bags that we would be bringing on this last expedition. Merrisa kept hugging me. She was shorter than Justin and me, about 5’4. Her normally dyed hair was in between colors at the moment, with only faded purple at the tips.



“I can’t believe you’re actually leaving us, Anthony!” she said, tears welling up in her eyes. I couldn’t help but sniffle and hug her back tightly. She was like a sister to me, and I cared about her deeply. Justin soon came around and also wrapped his arms around us, pulling us into a deep hug. We all knew this would be the last time we’d see each other and be able to do the thing we all loved to do. I just wish Justin hadn’t picked the hotel. 



He had kept the location a secret even as we drove towards it, only dropping vague hints about it being the greatest location we could’ve hoped to have. The rust bucket was running out of gas on the road, so we quickly pulled into a gas station. At this point, we’d been in the car a few hours already, so Merrisa and I got up to walk around the convenience store, while Justin pumped the car full of gas. 



I looked around the store, not particularly in the mood for any of the options laid out before me, but Merrisa beelined it straight to the energy drinks. As I was looking at the assortment of chips and other snacks, I noticed that Justin wasn’t standing by the car anymore. I looked over and found him at the register. I was going to walk over and ask him if he wanted something, but I quickly overheard him arguing with the gas station attendant, an older black guy. 



“You shouldn’t be heading up there. That place was shut down for a reason, and the last thing we need is a couple of kids digging up bad memories,” he warned, typing on his cash register and pulling out change for Justin. “I’m serious, son. Don’t go up there.” 



“I appreciate the warnings, man. But this is the last time we’ll get to hang out together, and I couldn’t think of a better place than the hotel for us to explore. We aren’t taking anything, and it’s going to be like we were never there to begin with,” Justin explained, putting his wallet back in his pocket and looking towards me, finally noticing that I was listening in. He quickly coughed dramatically and exited the gas station without another word. 



“Poor stupid bastard.” The attendant sighed, staring back down at his counter and just shaking his head. Merrisa quickly walked over and placed her items on the counter, unaware of what had just happened. I left her to pay for her snacks and went over to Justin as he was finishing with the refueling. 



“What was that all about?” I asked him, interrupting him as he replaced the gas cap. He looked at me and then looked behind me to make sure that Merrisa wasn’t close behind me, before pulling me close and whispering to me. 



“We’re exploring an abandoned hotel. A giant one, it was built in the 1910s and then one day just completely abandoned. No clue as to why, or what happened to it. I thought that it was an urban legend or something, but while searching for locations for our last exploration, I stumbled upon a post about someone discovering the hotel.” He pulled me away from the car and pulled his phone out. He pulled up a picture and showed it to me. It showed a blurry picture of what I figured was the hotel we were heading for. 



“Are we sure this place is abandoned? It looks brand new, like they’re going to open again soon.” Indeed, the hotel looked massive, and appeared to have about 12 or 13 floors, and showed no signs of nature having started to reclaim it, no broken windows, not even a tile out of place. It looked immaculate. 



“Crystal, this guy went inside and even took a few pictures of the interior. But you have to pay for those, and I couldn’t be bothered. We might as well go there and see it for ourselves, and it’ll make the perfect final adventure!” He wrapped his arm around my neck and smiled brightly. I was almost convinced, except for what the attendant had said. 



“What did you ask the gas station guy about?” I looked at Justin, and he let go of me, rubbing the curls of red hair on his head. “Were you asking for directions, or something?” I asked, to which Justin shook his head and pulled his phone out to show me the map. It showed that we were only thirty minutes from the approximate location of the hotel. 



“I was just asking if he’d heard about it. Then he started getting all doom and gloom about it. I’m sure he’s just trying to keep us from making a mess of the place. But it’s not like we ever do that.” I was going to question him further, but soon Merrisa joined us with her bags full of snacks, and Justin went to help her, leaving me conflicted about the location. It seemed like a dream come true, an entire hotel for us to explore. But I couldn’t help but think that something horrible lay in wait for us. 



Back on the road, the feeling of dread lingered, but it was soon replaced with joy when at last, after the long car ride jammed in the back of the Grand Am with all the snacks and Justin’s crap, we came to a stop at the edge of some woods. We all exited the car, and in the distance, we could see our destination at last. The hotel rose through the trees like a giant mountain, serving as a lighthouse to guide us. 



I still had reservations about the location, but the sheer size of it, and the possibilities that lay inside finally got the better of me. We all put on our backpacks and made sure the car was locked before we began trekking into the woods towards our destination. Justin quickly found a long stick and used it as a walking stick as we walked through the forest of crunching leaves. It was a slow walk towards the hotel, as the tree roots were hidden beneath the sea of leaves, and every few steps nearly caused us to fall flat on our faces. It seemed like even they were trying to stop us.



 Every few steps, we had to stop and use Justin’s new stick to probe around for any hidden roots. I stared around at the barren forest and couldn’t help but wonder if something was staring back at me unseen. The forest was eerily quiet; only the sound of us walking through the leaves was heard. There wasn’t a single animal around, not even a squirrel. Obviously, there wouldn’t be any birds this late into autumn, but the sheer silence of the forest unnerved me, and I again began to wonder if we should just turn back. 



But at last, we reached the hotel. It was surrounded by a chain link fence with razor wire on the top of the entire perimeter. “There should be a section of fence that got cut out for us,” Justin said, starting to look around at the fence to find it. Merrisa went over to help him while I continued staring up at the hotel. It looked so beautiful, and I couldn’t help but feel that every room in there was probably more expensive than I could ever hope to afford. My previous fears began to evaporate as I began to think of the possibilities waiting for us inside. 



“Found it!” Justin called out, pulling a few piles of leaves away and revealing a section of fence that had indeed been cut. I assumed the previous explorer had made it and left it for others like us to find. Justin took his backpack off and shoved it through the hole before crawling in after it. Merrisa went next, making sure not to snag her puffy jacket on the fence, and then finally it was my turn. I hesitated a moment, those final shreds of apprehension returning as I stared at the fence. 



“C’mon, Anthony! We haven’t got all day!” Merrisa called out as she and Justin put their backpacks back on and began to approach the hotel entrance. I took a deep breath and slipped my backpack off, pushing it through the hole and crawling in after it. Slipping it back on, I quickly raced after them as they walked up to the door. Trying to open it, we found it locked and began searching for a way inside.



“That guy didn’t say how he got inside the hotel?” I asked as I stared at all the windows, hoping that one of them might be cracked or missing. Merrisa was looking around the perimeter as Justin was still trying to get in through the front door, yanking and pulling on it like it was going to do something. 



“I had to pay for further access! I wasn’t about to give that guy 50 bucks.” Justin grunted as he yanked on the door some more, but it seemed to be bolted shut completely. I sighed and looked around further for a way in, almost thankful that the whole trip might have been a bust. That was until I came across a section of the wall that had what appeared to be chalk written on it. 



‘Knock’ was all it said. I stared at it for a moment before looking back over at the door. I walked past this one piece of graffiti and back over to the door, where Merrisa had made her way back to as well to watch Justin act like a monkey pulling on the door. I walked over to the door and simply knocked on it. After a few seconds, the doors loudly unlocked and swung open, sending Justin tumbling down to the floor. 



“How the hell did you do that?!” Justin asked in complete bewilderment. I smiled and shrugged, deciding to keep the secret to myself. I grabbed his arm and yanked him up, and together with Merrisa, we peered into the hotel. What met us was an impenetrable wall of darkness. Justin opened my backpack and pulled out the flashlights I had brought. Once they were distributed to the three of us, we flicked them on and entered the hotel. 



It felt like our flashlights barely penetrated the supreme darkness that ruled inside the hotel. What little we could see of them revealed that the outside wasn’t a facade. The inside was just as immaculate as the outside was, maybe even more so. The carpets looked like they were made of velvet, and the walls were hung with expensive-looking pieces that I was surprised were still hung up. In fact, everything inside looked like it belonged in a museum. We cautiously approached the front desk, and Justin couldn’t help but ring the bell. Its ring was crisp and loud, breaking the silence of the hotel with a loud, deafening ding. 



“Oops, I didn’t think it was going to be that loud.” He giggled, before I punched him in his arm. Merrisa was completely in love with the hotel, as she ran around the giant lobby looking at every inch of art and furniture that she could see. Justin went over to make sure she didn’t get any ideas of taking something with her. I stayed by the desk and looked around, noticing a wall of keys stationed behind the front desk. They were metal keys, and not a single speck of rust existed on them. 



Once Justin had managed to pull Merrisa away from the fancy furniture, we continued through the lobby, heading towards what we figured was the dining room. Even here, everything was spotless and perfect. Not a cobweb, speck of dust, absolutely nothing. Instead of urban exploring, it felt like we had just broken into a hotel that was shut down for renovations. Merrisa and Justin marveled at the set tables, completed with napkins folded into the shape of a swan. 



I started making my way over towards the kitchen when I began to smell food. Not rotting food, actual edible smelling food. Walking to the kitchen, I shone my light through the door and was amazed to find an entire spread of breakfast foods staring back at me. Perfectly done toast, cups of coffee that still had steam coming up from them, eggs done in any style you could think of, all of it looked like it had just been made a few minutes ago. 



“Guys? There’s food over here.” I called out to them. “Like, actual hot food.” They came over quickly and were stunned to see that I wasn’t joking. Merrisa picked up a small pitcher filled with milk and found that it was cold, and the milk wasn’t curdled or spoiled in any way. Justin picked up a cup of coffee and found that it was piping hot. 



“What the hell? Is this place actually open? Or is there like a meeting taking place soon?” Justin asked, placing the cup of coffee back on the service table. 



“Why would they be serving breakfast at 3 in the afternoon?” I asked him. I stared at the food before shaking my head and walking away from it. This was getting too weird, and that nagging feeling of not belonging here began to rear its ugly head back at me. I could tell Justin and Merrisa were also freaked out, but they continued on regardless. 



I followed after them, now painfully aware of how quiet the hotel was. Not a creak, not a groan, not the skitter of rats or anything was coming from the hotel. It was completely silent. I could only hear my own breathing and the sound of our backpacks jingling as we walked. I swear the silence was getting to me, as every few steps we continued down the halls of the hotel, I could feel that something was following us. I stopped every so often to try and see if something was back there. But there wasn’t. 



Eventually, we came upon the ballroom, and Merrisa was again amazed at how beautiful it was. A giant crystal chandelier swung overhead, and when we shone our flashlights on it, it cast a gorgeous array of colors across the floor and walls. We split up again to look around the room, with Justin sticking close to Merrisa. I walked over to the wall to examine what looked like photographs on it. But when I looked at them, I couldn’t tell what they were supposed to be. They were completely smudged, and at first, I thought they were covered in a layer of dust, but they were just strangely smudged. 



“Anthony! Come over here and help Justin! We found a mirror!” Merrisa called over to me. I looked back and nodded, quickly running over and dodging all the chairs and tables to where the two of them were. They were in the middle of the ballroom under the chandelier, and there Justin was pushing an object into place. It was covered with a thick cloth, but it was about six feet tall and had the dimensions I’d expect a mirror to be. 



Justin finally got it into place and came around the mirror to join us before he dramatically pulled the cloth off the mirror to present it to us. Shining our lights away from the mirror just enough to illuminate it, we were greeted by a tall silver-framed mirror. The silver was beautifully engraved with flowers and other designs. We stared at ourselves in the mirror, and I was amazed again that not a single speck of dust touched its brilliant surface. 



I stared at my reflection, my face soft and with the harsh cheekbones that Merrisa constantly told me made me look like an angry old man when I concentrated too hard. My short hair, slightly messy after all the crawling and sitting in the back of Justin’s car. My brown skin with several moles covering my face, it was me, alright. Until it started to not be me. Because I knew for a fact I wasn’t smiling that wide. And I was probably right in assuming that neither was Justin nor Merrisa. 



“What the hell?” I asked, as before our eyes, our reflections began to twist and turn into elongated versions of ourselves. It looked like some unseen force had grabbed our reflections and begun to stretch them into long, gangly versions of ourselves. It would’ve been bad enough that this was happening, but then my reflection pushed its face against the mirror and began to emerge from inside of it. 



“Oh my God!” Merrisa screamed as she quickly grabbed Justin’s arm and began to run away from the mirror. I quickly followed after them as I heard the creature fall to the floor behind us. We made it to the door to the ballroom and quickly turned to leave. Out of the corner of my eyes, I saw the other two reflections begin to emerge from the mirror as well. 



“What the hell was that mirror?!” Justin asked as we sprinted into the lobby and made a beeline to the front door. We would have to figure it out later once we were back to safety, but when we tried to open the door, we found that somehow it had now locked from the outside. I quickly shone the light on the door handles, and to our horror, we saw that there was no lock mechanism. I tried knocking, hoping that it might work, but this time the doors remained shut tightly. 



Suddenly, from behind us, we heard fast scurrying. The three of us turned around and shone our lights back in the direction of the ballroom. Merrisa screamed when she saw my reflection sprinting towards us at full sprint. It ran on all fours like some kind of big cat predator. And in an instant, it lunged at us. I quickly shoved both Justin and Merrisa away, slamming us into the ground as I shoved them to the side. 



My reflection crashed into the door with a loud crack, which I hoped might break the door. Instead, I watched as its long neck dangled to the side of its torso. I thought for a moment it had broken its neck. That was until its milky white eyes turned to look at us, and a giant, toothy smile spread across its face. It flopped its neck back into place and began to laugh at us. A high-pitched laugh that somehow both matched and didn’t match with its long twisted body. 



“Run!” I screamed at Merrisa and Justin. They quickly scrambled up to their feet and began running towards another hallway, one filled with hotel rooms. I followed after them as the creature that looked like me continued to laugh. And suddenly I heard several other pairs of legs following after us. 



“There! Stairs at the end of the hall!” Justin shouted. Shining my light down the hall, I saw that indeed, there was a door leading to a set of stairs. Justin raced ahead and quickly swung the door open. Merrisa ran through, and I heard her start to run up the stairs at full sprint. I quickly tried to follow after her, and as I reached to door, I could tell by Justin’s face and the sounds coming from behind me, that those things were right behind me. 



I quickly ran to the stairs and turned to see if Justin was following after me. Just as I watched him enter the stairwell, a gangly arm grabbed his legs and yanked him back out into the hall. I watched in horror as he was dragged back into the hall and as the creatures began to laugh together. 



I looked back up the stairs to see if Merrisa was still there, but I could see her light high up the stairwell; it seemed in a blind panic, she had kept running and running. I heard Justin grunting and fighting and knew I had to do something. I quickly ran into the hall and saw that Justin was desperately clinging to the doorframe, desperately trying to kick the creatures away from him. The one that looked like him was the one who had grabbed his leg and was currently trying to pull the rest of Justin towards him. I quickly grabbed onto Justin’s arms and tried to pull him back into the stairwell. 



“Hold on, man!” I shouted at him, trying my best to yank him in. I heard a giggle, and looking up, I saw that the other two reflections were sitting like dogs not too far away, both of them drooling in anticipation. I had to get Justin out, and I did my best to try and pull him, but his mirror version was much stronger than the two of us, and I could feel Justin’s grip on me and the doorframe slipping. 



Then it seemed that the Merrisa reflection grew too bored to wait, because it lunged at Justin’s leg and, in one swift bite, tore his leg off below the knee. I stared in shock as Justin began to bleed from his stump. The world went quiet as I stared at my best friend; it even felt like the world slowed down as I stared at the mirror creatures. Justin’s reflection seemed furious that the Merrisa creature had taken his food, because it immediately ignored us and pounced on her, quickly biting the other end of Justin’s leg and starting to try and tug it away from the Merrisa monster’s mouth. 



I didn’t have time to watch this, so while they were distracted, I quickly pulled Justin back into the stairwell and shut the door behind us. Justin was screaming in pain, and he was bleeding out fast. “Hold on, man!” I shouted at him, quickly ripping my belt off my pants and wrapping it around his leg. I pulled it as tight as I possibly could, hoping to stop as much of the blood as possible. I then took my jacket off and then my t-shirt. I quickly wrapped Justin’s stump as much as I could.



“Justin? Stay with me, brother.” I told him, quickly slapping his face a bit when his screaming stopped. I was worried he’d go into shock, but judging by his breathing and the fact he was reacting slightly to my slaps, it seemed he’d just passed out from the pain. We couldn’t stay here in the stairwell, so I quickly helped Justin up onto his one leg and began dragging and carrying him up the stairs. 



We made it to the fourth floor before I got exhausted from carrying all the weight of both him and the backpacks. I entered the fourth-floor rooms, and I sat Justin down against the wall of the hallway, looking for one of the doors that might be open. There was room after room, but all of them seemed to be locked up tightly. I looked around for a room and saw that the closest one to us was 426. Making a mental note of the room, I turned to Justin. His face was growing pale, and his breathing was getting shallower. 



“Justin? Talk to me here, brother.” I told him, walking over to him and opening one of my bottles of water, quickly splashing him in the face with it. He suddenly shot to life, and just as quickly was about to scream before I covered his mouth with my hand and shushed him. “I know it hurts like a bitch. But I need you to stay as quiet as you can, okay? I need to try and get the key to one of the rooms here. I’ll be right back, okay? I promise you.” He nodded through teary eyes. I gave him the water bottle and also retightened the belt as much as I could, which got a silent grunt and scream of pain from Justin. 



I left the backpacks with him and ventured back down the stairs to the first floor. I placed my ear against the door to see if I could hear the reflections. I didn’t, and so I cautiously opened the door

and stuck my head out into the pitch darkness of the hallway. I reached into my pocket and pulled out my keys as quietly as I could. Gently, I removed my flashlight keychain and cautiously turned it on. The light was enough for me to see a few feet in front of me, so I began to walk down the hallway.



There were stains of blood everywhere on the carpet, and I figured that the reflections must have gotten into a fight over Justin’s leg. The deafening silence once again began to play tricks on me. I couldn’t be sure if it was my mind doing something or if it was one of the monsters. But my friend was bleeding out, and I needed to hurry, so I started running to the front desk, all the while hearing strange noises coming from somewhere near me. I did my best to ignore it, reaching the desk and quickly jumping over it to the other side. 



Staring at the wall of keys, I found the key for Room 426. I swiped it and began my journey back down the hall towards the stairwell. As I did so, that strange noise continued to follow me. I stopped every few steps, and it seemed to stop as well. I shone my light behind me, but there wasn’t anything back there. I swallowed the bile building up in my throat and quickly made my way to the stairwell, still being followed by the strange noise. 



When I finally arrived at the door, I reached my arm out to open it, and as I did, I felt a wet sticky substance fall from the ceiling onto my hand. The ceiling. I stood frozen for a moment before I stared back up and saw that my own reflection was staring back at me. It was hanging from the ceiling and drooling at the sight of me. I quickly opened the door and slammed it behind me just as my reflection dropped down and tried to break down the door. I sprinted up the stairs, staring down at the steps in horror when I saw that Justin had left a trail of blood the entire way up to the 4th floor. But I didn’t have time to think of that, I had to get him to safety first. I burst out onto the 4th floor and was thankful to see that Justin was still alive and conscious. 



I quickly ran to the room and inserted the key, getting the door open before running back and lifting Justin back up to his foot, and helping him into the room. I quickly also tossed out backpacks into the room, before closing and locking it behind me. Panting and completely out of breath, I slid down the door and panted on the floor for a few seconds. But I didn’t have too long to wait and catch my breath. I quickly got back up and tended to Justin’s wound. 



“W-where’s Merrisa?” He grunted in pain as I retightened the tourniquet I’d made for him. I opened my backpack and quickly pulled out the first aid kit. It paid to have a mom who was a nurse, because she always made sure that we had a first aid kit and that we would have everything we needed inside it. 



“I don’t know, she ran further upstairs. After I clean your wound, I’ll go looking for her, okay?” I told him, and he nodded, wincing in pain. I knew he was in pain, but what I was about to do was probably going to be much more painful. I held up the bottle of rubbing alcohol to him. He stared at me for a moment before nodding. I walked over and got as many towels as the room had in stock before offering him one to bite into. He bit down on it before nodding at me. I pulled off my t-shirt from his leg stump and quickly began to douse the stump in alcohol. 



Justin screamed and grunted in pain, smashing his fist into the mattress and convulsing in pain. I felt horrible doing this to him, but I had to make sure he didn’t get infected from the wound. I used one of the bottles of water to wet the towel and began to clean his wound to the best of my ability. The beautifully white towels were soon stained a deep red, along with the mattress covers. After I had cleaned up his wound, I used gauze from the first aid kit to wrap up his stump. 



“That’s the best I can do for right now,” I told him, and he nodded, panting in pain with tears streaming down his face. I looked around the hotel room we’d run into in a panic. It was beautiful and even had a minifridge. 



“Merrisa…please, go find her, Anthony. I’ll be okay here,” he told me through a quivering voice. I wasn’t sure if I believed him, but I knew I had to go find her as well. I nodded, checking his tourniquet again, before wrapping my arms and hugging him tightly. 



“I’m coming right back, okay? Try to stay awake and whatever you do, don’t make any noises.” I patted him on the back before taking my backpack and pulling out an extra shirt I had packed. Pulling it over my head and then putting my backpack on, I waved goodbye to Justin and softly exited into the hall. I let out a shaky sigh, wondering how it had all fallen apart so quickly. But I didn’t have time to think about that, I had to find Merrisa. As I exited out into the stairwell, I shone my flashlight down the stairs and came face to face with my reflection. It was busy licking up all the blood that Justin had left behind. 



“Shit!” I screamed as it looked up at me with a smile and a high-pitched giggle. I started to run up the stairs, with the sounds of the reflection following close behind me. I panted hard, suddenly realizing how exhausted I was, as I began to slow down while sprinting up the stairs, while my reflection was easily keeping up with me. Suddenly, I came upon an open door on the 7th floor. Merrisa had to have gone through there, so I pulled my backpack off and spun on my heel to face my reflection. 



Just as it turned the corner, I swung my backpack against its face. Caught off balance and seemingly by surprise, it tumbled back down to the floor and down the flights of stairs it had just run up. Panting hard, I felt a violent need to throw up, but I managed to keep it down before entering the hallway of the 7th floor. I shone my light around the hall, looking for any sign of Merrisa. I soon stumbled upon her. What was left of her.



Her reflection and Justin’s were in the middle of devouring the last few pieces of her. Her head lay on the floor, cracked open and oozing out brains and blood. The reflections were digging into her torso, and when Justin’s reflection yanked out her intestines, Merrisa’s reflection, which had been snapping bones in half and sucking the marrow out, turned to Justin’s reflection and pounced on it, snarling and growling and trying to yank the intestines out of the reflection of Justin’s mouth. 



They were so busy trying to yank on the intestines that they paid no notice to me. All I could do was stare at Merrisa’s eviscerated corpse and turn to leave. I made my way back towards the stairwell, but thinking my reflection was probably making its way back up after me, I decided instead to keep walking down the hall, hoping to find the stairwell on the other end of the hall. Eventually, I found it and began to make my way back down to the 4th floor. 



Before I entered the hallway, I sat down on the stairs and began to cry uncontrollably into my hands. What was I going to tell Justin? Justin…the blood trail. A horrible feeling fell into my stomach, and I quickly shot back up and began sprinting towards the room I had left Justin in. And to my horror, I saw that the door was broken down. 



“Justin!” I screamed, heading into the room, and screaming in anguish when I saw that my reflection was in the process of ripping into Justin’s flesh. It snapped its head over to look at me and growled at me. I saw that Justin had managed to stab it with a pocket knife several times, and the knife was now sticking out of my reflection’s eye. “You piece of shit!” I screamed at it, wanting to tackle my horrifying doppelganger and rip him to shreds myself. But all it did was stare at me and giggle, and I realized that its giggles sounded like a hyena’s. And soon, down the hall, I heard two other giggles. Flashing my light down the hall, I saw that Merrisa and Justin’s reflection had followed me down the stairs and into the hall. 



I had to do something. As they slowly stalked towards me, giggling and licking their gore-covered faces, I dug into my backpack and found two items that were my best chance a survival. The bottle of rubbing alcohol and my road flare. Leaving my flashlight on the floor, I quickly lit the flare and shone it towards the reflections of Merrisa and Justin. They stopped in their tracks and yipped and screeched in terror at the sudden blinding light and loud hissing that the flare made. 



I slowly began to back up towards the stairwell, carefully unscrewing the cap of the bottle of rubbing alcohol. My reflection, seemingly done with eating Justin, exited out into the hallway and also began to follow after me, keeping a safe distance from the flare, but slowly following me as I continued to back up. Making it to the stairwell, I quickly turned and ran down the stairs, followed quickly after by the three reflections. When I reached the bottom, I turned and threw the bottle of alcohol at them. It caught them off guard as they hissed and growled at me. But a moment later, I threw the flare at them, and they went up in a blinding orange flame. 



They screeched in an earsplitting scream and quickly began to claw at themselves and at each other as they burned. I quickly closed the door to the stairwell and shoved myself against it as they tried in vain to escape. I stayed there until the screams finally stopped, and slowly opening the door, I was met with the scene of the charred corpses becoming horribly twisted and mangled together as they burned brightly together. 



I closed the door to the stairwell and slowly began to make my way to the lobby, before I collapsed to the floor in exhaustion. I don’t know how, but eventually I woke up in an intensive care unit. From what they told me, I’d been found alone in the woods, rambling and screaming incoherently. They thought I was on drugs, but when I was brought to the hospital, they found that I had none in my system. 



They also found Justin’s car, and he and Merrisa were declared missing people. I tried to tell the police about the hotel, the mirror, and the reflections of us that had spawned from the mirror. But they didn’t believe me, they thought I had something to do with it, they were sure I’d done something to Justin and Merrisa in a drug-fueled state. They locked me in a psych ward because of what I keep saying. 



The one saving grace of being here is that there are no mirrors in my room. I don’t think I could ever bear to see my own reflection ever again.

I’m looking for some advice or perspective about my older brother. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2020 and came home from prison in 2023. I knew things would be different, but when he got home I barely recognized him mentally or physically. Our bond that we had shared my whole life was basically gone, I assumed he just needed time to adjust to life outside.

After a couple months he started refusing his monthly shot. My mom and I would beg him, and he’d run away for weeks at a time, then come back ready to take it. His habits got worse too  barely sleeping, binge eating, drinking tons of black coffee, pacing and talking to himself, plus heavy drinking and weed use.

When we confronted him about mixing substances with his meds, it turned into one of many violent incidents and he ran away again. My mom eventually gave up and let him drink and smoke outside just to keep the peace.

After almost two years of arguments, disappearing, refusing meds, and domestic violence— he had a full psychotic break. He brought a weapon into the house, threatened to kill me, my mom, and my sister, threw my mom across the hallway, punched me, spit on me, and then ran out. That broke me. I love him, but it was clear he wasn’t stable enough to be home.

He came back days later crying and apologizing, but then immediately refused his shot again. His psychiatrist told us to call the police when he refuses since it’s part of his release terms. He was admitted for 72 hrs, and during that time he said terrifying things, that “our son is dead,” that my mom kidnapped him, that he’s the devil and Yahweh, that he’s been to prison in cities we’ve never even lived in, and that he didn’t know who me or my sister were.

He’s now back in jail and keeps getting put in solitary. He’s getting released soon, and I’m honestly concerned that the solitary confinement has worsened his condition.

I just want to help him and understand what I can actually do as his sister to support him. If anyone has advice or experience with situations like this, I’d really appreciate hearing it.",1,1765171862.0,schizophrenia,2,1.0,False

so im a lcsa and i have a TS who is by far the worst worker i have ever seen in my 2 years of being at wawa, she delegates all of the tedious ass tasks to her associates and only does what conveniences her whilst running shift.

i can go on and on for days about how terrible she is but id like to highlight today, we had a mclane delivery which she did not assist at all with, she had me putting away drystock (which i dont mind doing) but delegated the walk-in freezer, retail cooler and the aisles to base level associates, which it is her duty as a manager to  put away mclane delivery.

anyways long story short i put the drystock side of the order away and get my deli looking nice and spotless, my HFT was backed up and i had just about everything done, i noticed she had left the beverage area unattended for hours and told her that all of her coffees are out of code, she makes me do them instead, she also makes me make a beverage after i asked her to do it. i questioned the role deployment that had HER in beverage and she said ""regardless of role deployment its your job to pitch in"" when i very well have been pitching in way more than she had at all this entire day, i told her that and she said ""if you dont like it you can file up a report or go home""  after that she purposely made me cover a break at register cuz i was visibly angry. she said ""i think (my name) can use a breather""

following that WHILE IM AT THE REGISTER, shes just getting herself a coffee while doing fucking nothing, the coffee island looked horrible and she makes a snarky ass comment ""i think (my name) could use a coffee right now"" knowing damn well i was pissed at her and she just wanted a reaction out of me.

i have the papers ready for an incident report and this will be my second time reporting her, the first time nothing was done at all. she gets paid to fucking stand around and bark orders while im over here busting my ass and making less money than her its not fair in the slightest, im taking my incident report straight to my GM tomorrow and demanding a private conversation cuz this is just insane dude this woman sits on her highhorse and inconveniences all the associates while she gets the easy part of the job.",2,1765171799.0,Wawa,1,1.0,False

I built a tool called **AI Text Enhancer Pro**. It’s basically a specialized wrapper for the OpenRouter API designed for editing text and code.

The main feature I wanted was **""X-Ray Mode""**.  
Usually, when you use AI editors, the system prompt is hidden. With this tool, you can expand a panel, see the exact system instruction (e.g., ""You are a code editor...""), and tweak it right before hitting run.

**Other features:**

* **Streaming** with real token counting.
* **Diff View** (Original vs. Output).
* **Co-Writer Mode:** A dedicated UI for continuing text generation with specific presets.
* **Strict Monolingual Prompts:** I hardened the prompts to stop Gemini/Flash models from translating text when they should just be fixing grammar.

It runs locally (Python backend), keeps your API key encrypted, and supports any OpenRouter model.

Ashlie sat up and started to re-adjust her shirt. “Oh my god Zack, I’m sorry. We must have been too rough, huh?”

“Yeah,” Zack said, glancing up at Ashlie, then getting back to whipping up glass with his shirt that was already on the floor. Glass had also gone under the couch, which they had been making out in.

“Jesus Christ, it's everywhere,” Zack stuck his hand under the couch and tried to get it all. He, eager to impress Ashlie, lifted up the couch while she was still on it. His face went blank and his eyes filled with terror. 

Black empty eyes stared back at him from under the couch. He froze in fear but only for a second, his hand pulled back and he dropped the couch. Ashlie screamed, “what the hell, Zack?” 

“Your cat was under there,” he replied. “I-it just scratched me.”

“Zack, you know my moms allergic to cats, why would we have one in the house? What was under there?” She climbed down and tried to look under the couch. “Let me see.”

While Mark made an excellent point in stating that getting the movie picked up in foreign countries would be difficult, some people still missed the point. His movie will need subtitles, translations, dubbing, in order to be shown in foreign theaters REGARDLESS of if the people going to see the movie are familiar with Markiplier or can speak English.   
  
In watching movies with my family, I never watched trailers, I wasn't big on comics or the specific books some movies were adapted from, I had no idea who any of the actors were or what they did when they weren't acting, I couldn't pick apart their voices when they were voice actors, and it took years for me to care enough to associate actors' names with certain characters, etc. 

This is going to be the majority experience of people watching Iron Lung (especially for the parents who were convinced by their kids). They didn't see the trailers, they don't watch Markiplier, they don't know what game Iron Lung is adapted from, and they don't care to put a name to Mark's face. That is the audience these theaters are preparing for, this is what is holding up the acceptance from many theaters. No one knows Markiplier, cares about him, believes his claims about his fans coming in droves to view it, because he's effectively nobody in their minds. There are people, to this day, who are making YouTube reaction videos finally watching Markiplier because they spent the past 10+ years not watching his content. 

This is why Markiplier needs people to ask about having the movie shown at their closest theaters who can. You can email, fill a website form, go in person or call, and doing this as a local tells them that they have a community interest in the film and that means more than spreading the movie wide and no one showing up at those theaters. 

But there is literally no one else who can get the movie into a theater because Mark is an independent film maker. People are misunderstanding film festivals, distribution services, and more. Throw all of that out the window and watch it all get run over by a driver listening to Distractible. Because submitting to these things, which Mark undoubtedly has looked into, doesn't guarantee being accepted to show a film at these fests or working with these distributors. Because going these routes costs a lot of money that is not infinite, especially when YouTube rewards daily engagement and frequent uploads, which Mark hasn't been able to do.   
  
And this past year has been hard on everyone, even Sean's talked about his merch and coffee sales not going as well as they were projected to because of how people are struggling financially. It's part of why he's not doing Thankmas 2025. So, for Mark, he's taken several hits on his revenue streams, and he's still incredibly privileged/secure where he's at financially, but he is nowhere near able to pay the 70-80% cuts that these distribution service providers are going to demand of him.  
  
(And on top of this he wants to fix Cloak and has had his hands full with his wedding, Henry's passing, and even more that we're not privy to. The man is busy, he needs everyone's grace right now to get through this time).  
  
 It's quite literally a miracle that even 100 theaters agreed to show Mark's film, period, at all, end of. 

The fact that we're around 300 theaters is something everyone should be more than proud of. It's proof that it can reach the audience that wants it, but it's also what will allow Mark to go even further with distributing the film, getting it on a streaming service, and, eventually, get international showings/screenings where he can.

And it starts with one person, tossing a starfish of a request into their local theaters' ocean sized pool of potential screenings/showings.

1ph46s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ph46s1/20m_how_to_get_a_girl_even_interested/,20M how to get a girl even interested???,"Hello, apologies for the rather long post, but I need advice. I am a 20M, second year college student. I’ve only ever had one girlfriend, and after our breakup, a huge problem that plagued me in my high school years has been thrown in my face once again. The fact that ZERO girls are attracted to me.

Some have problems with sex/having people sleep with them, others have problems getting someone to commit to a relationship, or define one fully. I can’t even get a girl to give me  so much as a chance, not a single date.

For some background, back in high school, I was rejected by 4 different girls within the span of a little over half a year. These weren’t girls of the same friend group. These weren’t girls who I met in the cafeteria the day before and asked out the next day. These girls ranged from being semi-popular to absolute nobodies, athletes to bookworms, girls who could be models and girls who could never dream to be, and none of these girls ever interacted with each other ever, there was no social overlap at all! So I wasn’t particularly selective either. These girls I all knew for months before if not more. Got comfortable with them, made increasing gestures, sitting with them for lunch, daily greetings, working on homework and group projects with them, even solo invitations and hang outs after school.

So I would figure the next logical step would be confession of feelings, or asking them on a date (some people I’ve spoken with have even argued that those solo hang outs WERE technically dates, but I digress). I was never creepy about it, I never asked in front of an audience or anything, or put any kind of pressure on them. However, all ended the same way:

Girl #1: “I only see you as a friend,” and friends we remained, we would still work together with group projects, play board games, and remained on actually cordial terms.

Girl #2: “sorry no,” and we NEVER spoke again after that day, despite me still wanting to be friends with her. She wanted NOTHING to do with me after that day.

Girl #3: “maybe, I’ll have to think about it” then ghosted me, NEVER with me again after that either. Things ended same as girl #2.

Girl #4: “yeah that’d be nice” yet claimed to be perpetually busy for the entire summer when I tried to reach out and solidify plans. Never really spoke again after that, but those were more due to logistics than any feelings.

That was my high school experience, until I eventually met the single outlier, my 1st and only girlfriend. We dated for quite some time. But ultimately things did fall apart, and she broke up with me.

Now in college, I’ve tried once more to start dating, with no success either. But the caveat is I have lots of girls who are friends. And not some delusional “they only tolerate your presence” kind of “friends.” I am rather extroverted, and strike up pleasant and engaging conversations with literally anyone, and yes, girls of all different kinds included. There are girls who I hang out with at parties. Girls who actively seek me out and talk to me in/from classes. Girls who trauma dump and cry in front of me. Girls who ask me to walk around campus with them. Girls who consider me actively part of their group. (And yes, quick clarification that I don’t ONLY have female friends. Most of my friends are male, I’m just pointing that out to clarify my position.)

Aside from the ones who are obviously taken, the single girls who I have asked out, once more repeat the pattern from high school, and reject even the simple request of a date. Not sex. Not making things official. Just a simple gesture of getting coffee or dessert together. I genuinely believed they were sending strong signals with how they interact with me. Yet I STILL am getting rejected by them.

I’ve never once been in a position where I’ve been called creepy, or weird, or uncomfortable, or unwelcome, or arrogant. In fact, I’ve only gotten the opposite. I’ve been called safe, chill, open, confident, understanding, respectful, you name it. That’s how I’ve gotten so close to many of these girls in the first place. And yes I understand that’s the bare minimum, and that alone does not create interest, which is why I’m not resentful whatsoever. I get good grades (4.0 GPA), I’m not overweight, I’ve been called conventionally attractive by both male and female friends. Again bare minimum, but I fucking shower daily, brush my teeth, my clothes aren’t riddled with holes, I even spray a few spritzes of cologne whenever I go out to events where I will be seeing those girls. From my perspective and the perspective of others, many of these girls genuinely seem to enjoy my company, enjoy me as a person, enjoy talking to me, etc.

Part of the problem I’ve been told is that i find it very hard to be attracted to a girl and want more out of her UNTIL I can get comfortable around her. That typically involves multiple interactions (either solo or even group) with her over many weeks. But apparently by then the girl has made up her mind and put me in the friendzone??

I don’t know, but I would find it extremely uncomfortable to let a girl know I’m interested within the same day of even meeting her, that’s simply not really how I operate, I fear messing things up due to my underlying social anxiety, and screwing up my window for good if I jump the gun too early, when one or both of us aren’t ready.

Sure, I’ve also only had a small sample size, I’ve only ever been in one state, have asked out less girls than fingers I have over 3ish years, not hundreds of girls over decades like I’ve seen some other posts, so maybe I’m just getting bad luck or an incomplete picture? But aside from a single outlier, my point still stands, it seems like, even if they’re cool with me, and like me as a person, no girl in my life ever has (and at least presently) ever will give me a simple chance to take things to the next level.

It’s gotten to a point that I don’t know what to even do. It’s not like I have trouble maintaining interest or a relationship, i can’t even get over the hump of getting a girl interested in me in the first place.

So yeah, please advise yall, because I feel so stuck and helpless. This seems like it could have such a simple solution, or maybe not have one at all. Maybe all I need is more outside and completely detached anonymous perspectives and advice for my situation. I’m not even mad, I’m just so damn frustrated and more confused at my situation.

I will answer any questions and provide more details in case the picture I painted seems incomplete.",1,1765171175.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

1ph42hk,https://i.redd.it/0vgakbcxyw5g1.jpeg,The War God Alpha's Arranged Bride,"Today my boyfriend, Liam, will finally propose to me in front of my father.



He didn’t inform me in advance, but it was already widely discussed amongst the servants for a whole week. If he wanted it to be a surprise, then I was more than prepared to act like it was one. 



But I wasn’t sure if I could hide it well after I saw him, though. Even thinking about what was going to happen, caused a shiver of excitement to race through me. 



It had been ages since the Silverwood family last planned a wedding. In fact, the last true gathering the grand estate held was for my father’s second marriage to my stepmother, Isabella.



Isabella was a proud woman whose painted red lips would always be pursed with an attitude of arrogance and entitlement. The woman’s interests were strictly in line with either herself or her daughter, Samantha. Needless to say, she never failed to make me feel less than others around me. To her, I was considered no more than just another servant. A troublemaker. A ‘wild child’.



I supposed in a way I was wild. Well, I certainly wasn’t conventional on a social level, that was for sure. Growing up, I found comfort amongst the staff in the pack rather than my own relatives. 



But I stopped caring about their opinions a long time ago. As Liam and I got closer, I realized that all I truly wanted was the one thing I never felt like I had. A family. A true pack that I could call my own. And I was more than ready to have it all with Liam.



The love that came to be between us had blossomed like a special flower. Over time, he became my reason for wanting more beyond the estate. On the hardest days, the mere thought of him made me smile and feel better.



\*Knock. Knock. Knock.\*



I turned my head at the subtle knocking at the door. 



“Miss Evelyn,” one of the servants called softly. “Everyone is waiting for you in the drawing room. You must get ready.”



A glorious smile curved my lips as another whirl of giddiness coursed through me. Pulling back the bed covers, I slipped out of bed and rushed toward my wardrobe. I grabbed one of my better dresses and quickly hauled myself into the bathroom. 



Unlike my stepsister, I preferred to get ready in the morning without the help of several other maids. I found that it was a process that took far too long. Once I was properly dressed, I made a quick work of my hair and decided to keep my makeup light and natural.



With one last look at myself in the mirror, I slipped out of my room.



As I made my way toward the front drawing room, I walked past a small group of staff members, who all glanced at me with a pale, grave look.



It was as if they knew something that I didn’t.



It was almost enough to make me stop and ask what was wrong. However, a few more steps and I was already standing in the doorway of the drawing room. I was quick to discover that the energy in the room was as cold and dismal as it was in the hall.



All the excitement I had built up to this very moment had instantly depleted.



Both my father and stepmother stood on one side while Liam and Samantha were placed on the other side. As usual, my heart fluttered when my eyes caught sight of Liam.



However, his eyes remained locked on the floor, not sparing a single glance at me.



What was going on?



I tried to approach him. “Liam? What—”



“Evelyn.” Isabella swiftly stepped in my way, blocking me from getting to Liam with her typical, fabricated smile painted on her lips. “You see, dear...Well, there’s been a sudden change.”



My brows pulled together in question. Suddenly, my father, speaking out in his icy tone, spoke directly.



“Sit down,” he ordered.



As soon as I took my seat, Liam took a small step forward. His stern look caused my anxiety to simmer beneath the surface.



Why won't he look at me? Has something happened?



“I came to ask Samantha for her hand, Evelyn,” he said shortly. There wasn’t a stitch of emotion in his voice to be heard. 



My eyes widened and my mouth fell open in shock.



Samantha weasled her way back to his side and purposely nuzzled into his arm with a smug grin as though to mock me for my sudden loss.



“You see, I’ve found Samantha to be a much better match for me.”



I struggled to find the right words. “A better match...?”



“Samantha embodies the refined qualities an Alpha daughter should have. If she hadn’t rejected my advances in the past, I would never have come to you,” Liam explained.



My heart clenched in my chest so tightly, I feared that it was going to implode.



He never loved me.



All that time he and I had spent getting to know each other and wanting to plan a future, was all a lie. None of it was real.



“So, you just used me to stay close to the pack, is that it?” I asked weakly. The corners of my eyes were filled with unshed tears.



“I never loved you,” he claimed. “I only pursued you because Samantha initially rejected me.”



Isabella came to my side and half-hazardly patted my shoulder. There was no mistaking her pleasure in my humiliation and agony as her tone turned condescending.



“Samantha had changed her mind about Liam after seeing his pack’s recent success,” she claimed. “Let’s be honest with ourselves, Evelyn. Did you really believe that someone like you would have a successful and fruitful marriage with Liam? You know as the elder sister, you really ought to step aside for Samantha. She deserves a chance at something special and important.”



It was the same story as always—whenever Samantha wanted something of mine, she took it.



Why would this have been any different?



I hastily put a decent amount of space between Isabella and myself. Blinking back the mournful tears of my tattered future with the man I thought cared for me, I waited for my breathing to settle. The only consoling thought I had was the fact that most of Liam’s success was all due to me and my efforts.



I’d spent months designing and planning out trade routes and building personal connections with other neighboring packs whose tools and supplies are vital for the developing growth of the future of Liam’s pack. Whereas Samantha’s concerns were purely placed on herself. She never so much as spoken to a servant if it didn't involve some kind of selfish need.



All that time spent, all that energy and effort was mine—Samantha had no part in any of it. She didn’t know the first thing that went into knowing how to properly care for a pack. Yet, everyone believed her to be the perfect match for Liam. But I knew better.



Time will tell everyone the truth.



Unfortunately, Isabella wasn’t finished in her rant over how wonderful of a match Liam and Samantha were for one another. I honestly had half a mind to leave the drawing room and head back to bed. Shockingly enough, the conversation shifted back to me.



“There’s really no reason for you to continue mulling around the place since your father and I have already found you a better husband,” she commented.



I snapped my head around to glare at the woman in shock. I could easily make out the excited glimmer in her eyes.



My stomach filled with dread and I instantly knew that it wasn’t good.



Chapter 2: Worry and Doubt


\[Evelyn’s POV\]



Before I even had the chance to ask who it was my parents were choosing to give me away to, Isabella stepped forward with a wide grin on her face.



“It's Young Alpha Alexander from the Moonstone Pack,” she said.



My heart sank. Within seconds, the shock was beginning to sink in.



I wasn’t sure when I stopped taking in literal breaths. All I knew was that all the blood that was meant to be circulating through my system had rushed to my head, making me feel dizzy and disoriented.



I was waiting for my knees to buckle out from under me. I was waiting for my vision to grow tunneled and for my sight to black out.



...Alexander Kingston...



I didn’t know anything personal about him but I knew of his pack’s reputation. The Moonstone Pack was the current largest pack in the country. According to what I’ve heard through passing conversations amongst the staff, Moonstone Pack owed all of its success to its Alpha.



If it was three months ago, it was impossible for our packs to unite through marriage. Even if it happened somehow, Isabella would have saved the choice for Samantha.



The young Alpha had been praised for being handsome and highly skilled in battle. He had defeated many poorly managed or undeserving Alphas and had earned the title of War God. He was exceedingly intelligent and had expanded his territory through trade.



Our pack was truly no match for his.



However, three months ago, he’d been horribly injured in a major car accident. Now, word was circling around that he looked terrifying, was disabled, and his temperament had become violent due to his life’s changes.



Alexander’s pack had stopped expanding, and rumors that Alexander would never recover began to spread. And since then, he’d managed to turn down—rather frighten off two other previous matches. It seemed no one was able to handle this newly transformed Alpha.



“You see, it’s all been arranged through the King,” Isabella recounted.



“The King?” My brows pulled together in immediate confusion.



What does he have to do with something as trivial as this? Unless...



Rumor had it that because of Alexander’s striving popularity, he led the Alpha King to become rather wary of his ever-growing status.



The Alpha King, feeling threatened by Alexander's strength and constant pack expansion, was probably looking to further weaken him. That had to be it.



Setting him up with someone, like myself, who didn’t come from a necessarily large and influential pack, meant that Alexander wouldn’t be able to benefit from any future marriage. No doubt the other women came from smaller packs as well.



Perhaps, the young Alpha had come to that exact conclusion himself.



“Why me?” I asked bluntly. “Surely I had nothing more to offer him than the last two Luna’s he’s previously scared away.”



“It’s true, the Alpha King has tried arranging marriages for Alexander before—1 or 2 times, I believe,” Isabella went on with a dismissive wave of her hand.



I clenched my jaw at her impassive behavior toward the situation. “Yes, but they were always called off before the wedding due to his frightening appearance, confirming the rumors.”



My fear of the matter was evident, but my Stepmother merely went on to explain with a smile.



“The King is willing to offer us a large sum of wealth for this marriage. It’s an opportunity we should accept. I thought it over, and since Alexander is twenty-eight, he’s not a good match for your younger sister. You’re older, so it has to be you. It’s just that your sister likes Liam, so we’ve adjusted the marriage arrangements.”



Oh, for Christ’s sake. I knew that age was never the real issue here. Hell, I was only twenty-two, just four years older than my sister.



I didn’t bother to hide my sneer.



Yes, you’ve adjusted the marriage arrangements at the cost of everything I’d been building and held dear to me.



My relationship with Liam really held no hope. But from the clear look of things, he didn’t seem to mind the switch. Samantha remained happily wrapped around his arm while occasionally shooting me with a knowing grin.



My heart hammered within my ribcage so fiercely, that I was afraid it was going to break. The anger that was simmering beneath my surface was gnawing at my very bones.



I knew that was just some bullshit excuse for them to use rather than admit the real truth. Money. This all came down to the money the Alpha King was offering my family. The man had raised the stakes on this specific proposal and my parents were all too happy to jump at the opportunity.



I had always been an outsider in this pack, never receiving any privileges that the rightful daughter to the Elder Alpha should have. Now, they were trying to profit from my marriage?



“You can’t force me to do anything,” I said, intending to leave.



My father’s voice came out strong and unnerving. “Perhaps you ought to think about your twin brother, Edward.”



My heart tightened, and I turned back in disbelief to look at my father.



Alexander wasn’t the only one who suffered a traumatic incident. My twin brother, Edward, had also been injured in that car accident three months ago. He now needed various machines to survive.



Is my father seriously using my brother’s life as a threat?



“Edward is your only male heir. Do you want to stop saving him?”



“He’s been bedridden for three months, and Isabella is pregnant with a boy, the doctor says.”



My jaw dropped in shock. The tears I managed to blink back had come rushing forth.



Unlike Isabella, my father wasn’t hiding Alexander’s terrifying nature. He was blackmailing me with collective interests and my brother’s life. If I married Alexander and accepted the King’s reward, they would take care of Edward. Simple as that.



“Fine,” I could feel my voice shivered.



It pained me to no end. But I had no choice.



\[Third-Person POV\]



Alexander Kingston, stood tall and handsome, his face utterly flawless, in front of the large window in his private home office. Oliver, his loyal Beta, stood idly next to his desk.



“How come there's another woman agreeing to marry me?” he asked darkly.



Oliver spoke plainly. “Perhaps it's because of the king’s reward,” he answered. “I heard it was rather substantial.”



The Alpha blew out an impatient breath and bit back a sneer of disdain. “No matter. She’ll run like all the others.”



He turned to glance over his shoulder. “Everything else should proceed as usual, and we must respect the king's arrangements. But just like before, prepare those things for me. I want to teach this young girl a lesson about her recklessness.”



Alexander was out to disprove the famous phrase, ‘third times the charm’. He was willing to ensure that this marriage did not take place.



Chapter 3: Early Morning Jitters


\[Evelyn’s POV\]



I hadn’t wanted to get out of bed that morning. The moment my eyes peeled open, I was instantly filled with horrible regret and an overwhelming sense of anxiety.



This wasn’t how I was supposed to be feeling—Not on the day of my own wedding.



I kept wondering if I had made the right choice in my response to the Alpha King’s proposition. However, no matter how long I allowed myself to dwell on the issue, I always found that I was led to the exact same conclusion. My brother.



This marriage is not about me...It’s about Edward.



All that mattered was that with that money from the King, he would be able to continue the medical care that was needed.



I didn’t exactly come to any sort of happy resolution on this whole matter. I just came to the realization that I didn’t have a choice.



Might as well, get up so we can get this whole thing over with then.



Without wasting any more time, I rolled out of bed and headed straight for the bathroom. I threw my hair up into a loose bun on top of my head and grabbed for my robe. Once I secured the soft belt around my waist, I made off toward the living room for breakfast.



My mind felt hazy. Of course, everything around me came into clear, painful focus the moment I got to where I was going. I stood frozen in the doorway of the living room while Liam was already present.



He was sitting at his usual spot with a mug of coffee and the latest copy of the newspaper clutched in his hands. I hated how he acted like nothing had changed. How he hadn’t literally torn my heart from my chest by allowing this ridiculous switch to happen.



If he had stepped up to deny my parents the chance of selling me off to this unknown Alpha, perhaps things would have turned out a lot differently. Then again, this was the same man who stood awkwardly silent through the entire ordeal.



What was he even doing in here?



Everyone had been told that this was where the new bride-to-be was meant to be getting ready before the ceremony.



Liam spotted me in the doorway and lowered the paper down. I curled a brow upward in question



“Why are you here? Come to give me some pointers on how not to treat my future spouse?” I asked, my voice dripping in sarcasm.



He opened his mouth to speak, but quickly closed it into a firm line. I narrowed my eyes at him, wanting to make him disappear from my sight.



My stomach spun with sickness from the notion that we were once together. After being told that my future was being bought and sent away, our relationship felt like it had happened decades ago.



Yet, it still hurt me to simply look at him.



“My, my. Why the long face?” Samantha asked with a delighted giggle. “This is your wedding day, shouldn’t you be happy or something?”



“Shut up, Samantha,” I muttered.



My stepsister burst out in laughter while Isabella came into the room.



“You know, you really ought to be getting ready,” she remarked. “We’ll be heading over to Kingston Hall very soon.”



Samantha wrapped her arm around Liam and beamed at me with fake enthusiasm. “Yes, we’re all looking forward to your ceremony.”



Oh, wonderful. Was she really dragging Liam along?



“So the wedding is going to be taking place there?” I questioned dully.



“Yes. Since Alexander can’t travel far, the wedding will be held in one of his many rooms instead,” Isabella explained.



“No doubt it will be a simple wedding,” Samantha pointed out roughly. She turned to glance at Liam, giving him a flirtatious smile. “Remember, I’m expecting a grand wedding with dozens of flowers and shiny, white satin.”



\*Knock. Knock. Knock.\*



The gentle knocking on the door had us all turning our heads to find that the wedding stylus team had arrived. Isabella graciously allowed them all in and the team began setting up each of their designated stations.



Claire, the team leader, led me over to one of the chairs and placed a large ipad in front of me. The screen showed several gorgeous, one-of-a-kind wedding gowns. As I scrolled through, each one of them was more expensive and beautiful than the one before it.



I had no idea how my family was going to afford such a luxurious dress and setup.



“Alpha Alexander has already ensured that today’s preparations have all been financially covered,” Claire told me. She gave me a knowing wink, giving my nerves a chance to calm down.



Damn, could this woman read minds too?



Looking at the screen, Samantha folded her arms over her chest and wore a bitter expression on her face.



“You shouldn’t rely on money to make this marriage work,” she said tightly, as if she was persuading herself. “Money isn’t everything, you know.”



“Whatever you say,” I replied while I decided on a hand-embroidered, off-the-shoulder gown with a long, lacy train in the back. I would personally prefer simpler ones, but this is what I imagined to be appropriate for the Luna of an Alpha like Alexander. Elegant, noble, exquisite.



The stylist team pulled out the dress I’d chosen and immediately helped me get into it. Within the hour, I had transformed into a completely different person it seemed like. My hair had curled and loosely pinned back with pearl-studded pins. My makeup was light but impactful.



As soon as the final touches were made, I stepped out of the living room where I was met with dozens of wide eyes and opened mouths. Nearly the entire pack was there to see how I turned out. They were all graciously taken aback by my otherworldly appearance.



Even my family had very little to remark on. What amused me most of all was the engrossed, star-struck look Liam wore on his face. Samantha was quick to swat at his arm and pout at his reaction.



As I was preparing to leave, I had one of the staff grab the bag I had pre-packed the night before.



After the ceremony, I wasn’t likely to return to this place so I made sure to pack the things that were most important to me—just the clothes I wore most often, along with my mother’s keepsakes, which I always carried with me. One of which was a handcrafted, sea-blue aquamarine necklace.



Normally, I would keep it in my side pocket. However, this dress didn’t come with any sort of place for me to store the keepsake; so, I made sure to safely stow it in my bag.



While my family headed out to their own vehicles, I secretly snuck away to visit my brother. The only sound that greeted me was the representative echo of the machines that were keeping him alive. It used to break my heart, but over time, I found them to be a comfort, knowing that they were keeping Edward alive.



I gently bent down to press a soft kiss on his head. “I’m going to miss you so much. But I’m going to make sure that you’ll be taken care of, okay.”



Making my way outside, each of the staff members grasped my hand and wished me luck on the new chapter of my life I was undergoing. It made my heart swell with sadness, seeing they were all reluctant to see me go.



“Hurry up, Evelyn!”



“That’s right, we don’t have all day.”



One of the staff members leaned forward and gave me a reassuring smile. “Don’t worry, we’ll make sure that your brother is well-looked after.”



“Thank you,” I whispered.



I turned back to face my family and to no one’s surprise, they were all seethingly impatient. My father couldn’t have looked any less interested in what was going on. The only look Isabella really had in her eyes was eagerness—no doubt for the money that the Alpha King was promising them. Samantha was still relishing in the childish tantrum she’d thrown earlier while I was getting ready.



Then there was Liam. The man seemed to look at me with loss and an unspoken solemness. Was he possibly feeling regret?



It shouldn't matter what he’s feeling! It’s too late. He’s clearly made his decision and he’s not going to speak up now.



Nevertheless, I felt deeply helpless. It was hard to think that the pack members seemed to care more about me than my own family.



I made my way over toward the car but was stopped by Samantha holding up her hand.



“You know that our car is too small and your dress is likely to get wrinkled,” she said with a cold smile.



Claire suddenly rushed to my side. “No worries. Alpha Alexander also arranged for multiple large limousines to pick up you and your family. He wanted to ensure that your dress stays wrinkle-free.”



“Really?” I asked with a hint of disbelief.



It was hard to believe that this was all coming from the same man who was known for having a mean temper. Perhaps it was to show the King that he respected the arrangement that had been made. 



Claire nodded her head and smiled. 



“Yes, the cars will arrive in just a few moments, and also a delicious lunch will be served on board, so you can eat should you get hungry.”



I caught Samantha’s newly soured expression out of the corner of my eye. Truly, neither one of us expected Alexander to make such a grand show of this arrangement. Either way, it left Samantha sneering with irritation. She folded her arms over her chest and pouted like a child. 



I could feel my face flushing under her words. I wasn’t used to being treated with such extravagant care. Having never been lavished with so much attention before, I wasn’t sure how to handle it.



The journey to Kingston Hall was long and I hadn’t officially arrived at Alexander's pack until that afternoon. All I felt was nervousness.



Chapter 4: What’s Waiting At The Altar


\[Evelyn’s POV\]



When the cars pulled onto the Kingston Estate, my eyes were instantly drawn to the vast landscapes that surrounded the massive manor. 



The place was surrounded by gorgeous, tall pine trees that bordered the property like a natural wall of defense. I knew the Moonstone Pack was known for their trading, but nothing would have ever prepared for the amount of various crops and resources that the estate single-handedly provided.



I was truly captivated.



There were orchards and organized sections of fruit-bearing bushes and vegetable patches—all of which were being tenderly attended to by numerous groups of pack members.



Each one looked determined, focused, and well inept to work in such rigorous conditions. As the limousines pulled through, some of the pack members glanced up from their work to steal a quick glance at what was going on. I wondered if any of them knew about what was going on today. Everyone seemed busy at work and there wasn’t any other real indication that there was a wedding about to take place.



My heart leaped into my throat for the hundredth time since this morning when the car finally came to a stop. The actual house looked like something out of a fairytale.



As far as I was concerned, Silverwood Manor had always been a place of beauty and high social standing. However, nothing could have prepared me for the architectural majesty that was Kingston Hall. The place was massive, likely three times the size of my own home.



Its light red brick structure was adorned with white marble and numerous carved statues overlooking the massive grounds. It was elegant but cold. Maybe it was because Alexander technically lived alone.



I took a few steady breaths in, hoping to mentally prepare myself for the event that was about to take place. The driver got out and came around to open the door for me. With the much-needed help from a few of the maids, I was able to gracefully get out of the car without too much fuss.



An older woman with a formal-looking uniform came out to greet us with a soft smile.



“You must be Miss Evelyn,” she said. “I’m Nina, the housekeeper here.”



“Hello, Nina. It’s nice to meet you.”



“And these people must be your family,” she greeted. “If you will all kindly follow me, I will take you to the living room.”



My family and I were led into the front hall where I was pleasantly surprised to find lightly decorated for the occasion. Small bundles of freshly clipped and arranged flowers were placed throughout the place along with delicate ribbons of white lace.



The living room was large and decently spacious with high ceilings. The decorations were gradually carried throughout the place. It all looked unexpectedly respectable, given the circumstances. I really thought that for a brief moment, things were going to be alright.



Maybe I wasn’t going to regret this marriage, after all.



However, those hopeful thoughts vanished from my mind within seconds. The moment I turned my head to glance down the small, make-shirt aisle, I noticed that beside the altar, on the right side, was a wheelchair, a mask, and half a prosthetic limb.



It was a terribly eerie sight but it begged the question. Where on earth was Alexander?



“Um...”



Where was he? Did Alexander somehow forget that today, he and I were supposed to be getting married?



I doubted it. Although I didn’t personally know Alexander, something was telling me that he would never forget something as vital as this. And Alpha like him wasn’t prone to making careless mistakes. So where the hell was he?



Nina cleared her throat. She appeared a bit sheepish as she spoke. “Alpha Alexander will not be making an appearance, and these items are here to represent him.”



I raised my brows in shock. “Are you serious?”



She nodded his head.



“What about his family?” I asked.



Again she shook her head. “They couldn’t make it today.”



What the hell kind of wedding was this?



Nina gestures for the rest of my family to kindly take their seats while she goes to greet the priest. As soon as she left the room, Samantha broke out into endless cackles. Her face was turning redder by the second and she was gasping for air.



“Oh, this is absolutely hysterical,” Samantha laughs. “Your fiancé didn’t even have the decency to show up to his own wedding. Clearly, he’s not looking for a wife, but someone else to take care of him.”



My cheeks flushed with deep embarrassment.



Liam lightly cleared his throat. “Samantha, perhaps you shouldn’t—”



Samantha ignores him. “Come on, am I the only one seeing this setup here? Just think how well you'll fit in here, Evelyn,” she went on. “You were practically a servant in the last house, now you’ll be a caregiver to a horrible disabled man in this house.”



My heart sank into my stomach while an awful feeling washed through me. Samantha had always been obnoxious, but I never knew just how little control over her behavior she had. For Christ’s sake, we were literally standing in Alexander’s home and she was utterly bad-mouthing him.



What bothered me all the more was just how useless Isabella and my father were at that moment. Neither one of them even batted an eye at my Stepsister’s appalling attitude.



I turned and glared at the younger girl with anger behind my voice. “Shut up, Samantha!” I hissed. “Even if Alexander is disabled, he still deserves your respect. These things here are just normal tools that allow him to be able to function.”



But Samantha merely smirked and shook her head. “Wow, you’re not even married and already you’re defending him. It’s both sweet and pathetically sad.”



Right as I was about to go off on her again, another voice spoke out.



“May I beg your pardon?”



The tone was calm yet authoritative, sending chills down my spine. 



All of us turned our heads to see a man, sitting in a wheelchair while wearing a half-formed mask over his face. There were two staff members standing behind him along with another man who I assumed to be his close assistant.



Oddly enough, my father was the first to react.



“Alpha Alexander.”



Was this really him?



Although he was sitting in a wheelchair, the man was physically fit and strong. His posture exuded confidence, giving off an oppressive aura as someone in a higher position.



His sapphire-like eyes, sharp jawline, tan skin, and sensual lips—combined with the mask and his expensive attire—gave him an air of mystery and nobility. It made one wonder how striking his face must be underneath the mask, which is in stark contrast to the terrifying rumors that surrounded him.



But everyone knew that underneath the mask, his face had likely been severely burned, making me feel twinged with pity.



“S-Sorry,” Samantha meekly apologized.



My father turned to give my Stepsister a weak look of disapproval for her earlier behavior.



“Samantha, you ought to keep better control over your words and know if and when it’s appropriate to say such things,” he reprimanded. “Perhaps, you should go and wait in the car.”



I fought back the urge to roll my eyes at the scene. Of course, even at a time like this, my father would be going easy on Samantha.



With the one half of his face that was still visible, Alexander raised a brow.



“Is that all?” he asked casually. “For someone with such a loose tongue, I think you deserve to have it removed.”



Chapter 5: The Kiss


\[Evelyn’s POV\]



For the first time in several years, I watched my father’s face break out into a look of pure fear.



My father was never known for being a weak man. He had never been one to grovel or plead when mistakes were made. He had always worn a stern, unwavering stoic expression. Even during the toughest times, the man was practically unbreakable.



But that clearly wasn’t the case here. This man who hadn’t shown me an ounce of emotion for the majority of my life had practically broken into tears. His expression was pinched and shaking with worry—all because of what Alexander remarked in light of Samantha being reprimanded.



My eyes practically bulged out of my head when my father nearly stumbled to his knees.



Alexander had frankly shocked everyone with his remark.



Was he being serious? Imagine, a world without Samantha having the ability to speak.



My own breathing faltered for a brief moment. The undeniable look in Alexander’s eyes was proof that he was utterly serious. Not a single shred of evidence was visible in order to make me think twice. It sent countless shivers down my spine.



For crying out loud, my own father was practically shaking where he stood. What was this man capable of? Was I seriously about to marry this man?



While my father was seconds away from groveling, Isabella looked as though she was on the borderline of fully fainting. Liam looked stunned and didn’t even bother to speak up on Samantha’s behalf. And as for my dear Stepsister...She turned several shades paler and was on the verge of tears.



“Oh, please,” my father begged. “Please spare my daughter such torture.”



My gaze flickered back to Alexander who appeared even more disinterested than when he first entered the room. He let out a long breath and waved his hand.



“Something must be done about her abominable behavior,” he insists. “I refuse to even think that I would be associated with such a family that allows their own daughter to speak with disrespect and disdain toward people she doesn’t even know.”



Again my father was pleading for mercy on behalf of Samantha’s poor manners. Still, no one else was willing to step up on her behalf to reason with Alexander. It was like he was the one who held all the power in the situation and all of them knew it.



“I’m afraid I must insist that something be done,” he pushed sternly.



My father slowly nodded his head and glanced at Samantha in shame. “I understand.”



Samantha was shaking her head in fear; still too frightened to speak up for herself. Liam stood there with not a single word or thought—most likely because he too was afraid of what Alexander would do.



Oddly enough, Alexander had turned his head to spare me a quick glance. I partly wish I knew what sort of thoughts were running through the man’s mind. Then again, maybe it was a good thing that I didn’t.



“I take back my previous order and instead demand that your Stepdaughter be confined for no less than a month,” he stated coldly.



Samantha broke out in sobs. Good God, one would have thought she’d just been sentenced to a lifelong stay in prison. This time Isabella stepped forward and tried to plead for her daughter’s case. But Alexander wasn’t hearing any of it.



“One month,” he ordered. “She will be confined for one month in which she will spend reflecting on her boorish behavior and learn how to properly conduct herself in the presence of others.”



“Oh, please!” Isabella implores with desperation. “Please, don’t be so harsh on my daughter. It’s true there are times that she thinks before she speaks but that shouldn’t mean she should be harshly punished for it—”



“One more pointless word and I will happily extend the punishment for you as well,” Alexander snarled. “It seems that the both of you could deeply benefit from some decent self-reflection.”



Isabella instantly closed her mouth while her eyes remained wide in shock.



Suddenly, Nina reappeared with the priest following behind her. She takes notice of the odd shift in the room.



“Oh, sir! I wasn’t expecting to see you today,” she said with a pleasant smile. “You see, the priest has just arrived.”



The elderly man stepped forward and gave Alexander a slight bow of respect and gently cleared his throat.



“Alpha Alexander, will you be proceeding with the marriage ceremony?” he asked.



My stomach twisted with uncertainty. Wait. Did Alexander have an actual choice in all of this?



Was he not under the obligation of the King, like I was to my own family?



I was instantly put off by the thought that my opinion on this whole ordeal never mattered. Apparently, the same could not be said for him. The room fell silent as we all awaited his answer. Alexander didn’t give any immediate answer to the priest and instead turned his head to look back at me.



My heart thudded frantically in my chest, having no idea what was going to happen next.



“Evelyn... right?”



I blinked back the surprise in my eyes and lightly nodded.



“Yes.”



Somehow his features almost soften as well as his tone. “Are you sure about going through with this wedding?” he asked.



My lips parted in shock. “Are you...Are you asking for my opinion on the matter?”



Once more, my father stepped forward and spoke with jumbled hastiness.



“Of course, she’s going through with this marriage,” he said. “She’s agreed since the moment we first told her about it.”



Alexander barely glanced at my father. “I believe I was talking to Evelyn. Not you,” he interjected sharply.



My father backed off slightly, casting me a stern, warning look while Alexander’s back was turned. It made me remember what was at stake.



Edward. This marriage is meant to help take care of my brother.



All I could do was nod my head. The Alpha hesitated for a moment, seeming skeptical about my answer. 



Nevertheless, he turned back toward the priest. “Proceed with the ceremony.”



I wasn’t sure whether to feel relieved or filled with dread.



One of the maids swiftly took away the empty wheelchair and Alexander resumed its place. The priest stood at the head of the altar and my father leisurely escorted me down the aisle.



While the priest began to read through the various selected passages, my mind started to wander off. I had to face the facts. My life had changed dramatically in just a few days.



After giving it much thought over the past two days, I realized that if my family and fate were truly conspiring to put me in a difficult position, I had no choice but to make the best of it.



I must live on—for the sake of my brother. I have to do my best to live a better life.



I’d always put the interests of others before me, even when I was a child. So there was no reason why I shouldn’t be able to do it now.



When it came to Alexander, I didn’t really find him all that terrifying as those rumors had insisted. Sure he was intense and direct, but he wasn’t hard to look at.



Having been lost in my thoughts, I completely blocked out the part in which the priest had asked me to repeat the words ‘I do’. Just as I was about to correct my oversight, Alexander held up his hand.



“Stop.” He gave me that same sincere look from earlier. “Evelyn, you don’t have to force yourself to do this. I will allow you to not marry me without consequences.”

1ph41ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ph41ks/its_been_four_years_to_the_day_since_i_was/,It's been four years (to the day) since I was blindsided,"I won't go into too much detail, since you all know the story: seemingly healthy relationship, deeply in love, plans for marriage and children starting to form... Then, on the 8th of December 2021, apropros of absolutely nothing: ""I don't think this is working."" After what could only charitably be called a discussion, I start crying; she goes into the kitchen and makes herself some lunch.

She gives me no reason other than, ""I just don't think we're compatible"", so I provide the reasons for her. I start apologising for anything I can think of; it must be *my* fault, after all, for this to have come out of the blue. She doesn't stop me.

She mentions separating our finances and I tell her through my tears that we can do it 50-50. She says that wouldn't be fair to me, since I contributed a much higher initial sum than she did, but I insist. Now's not the time, though; we'll have a conversation about it later, when we're both more composed.

Then she leaves.

Cue, on my side, an extreme emotional breakdown--can't eat, can't sleep, can't fathom the idea that this is the end for us. Suicidal thoughts prompt a visit to the doctor and a prescription for antidepressants--not the first time I've been on them, but I'd worked hard to come off them in the past, so this feel like failure.

Cue, on her side, an inexplicable metamorphosis. No more warmth, no more compassion, no trace of understanding as to what has just transpired. She's learning to ride a motorcycle now, and travelling in America. Is she manic? (I'm a doctor, so I'm looking for a diagnosis.)

I send very few text messages: an appeal, one week later, for a proper conversation over coffee (denied) and a request to pick up my belongings (""Can we do it next? I'm really busy."")

When I finally do pick up my things--nearly a month later--someone else's stuff is in my home. She has a roommate now (a guy, to boot). She's unhappy because he isn't paying rent and has far more stuff than she expected. She doesn't mention the fact that rent has been coming out of our joint bank account for weeks now, despite me living elsewhere, or the fact that my name is still on the lease.

I expect us to talk about finances, but we don't, because she's already split them herself, perfectly down the middle. Well, almost; it was an odd amount, and she just so happened to give herself the extra cent. Financially, it's meaningless; symbolically, it couldn't carry *more* meaning.

And then we just... never talk again.

So, how am I now? Did I travel the world, pick up new hobbies, and meet some new? Or did I fall deeper into a pit of despair, gradually losing the will to live and unable to ever scrub the memories from my mind?

As always, the reality is somewhere in the middle. I haven't travelled (travelling alone just doesn't appeal to me), I still have the same old hobbies, and I haven't met someone new. I *have*, however, developed a newfound appreciation for being single. I thought people who claimed to enjoy being on their own were delusional idiots, but now I'm eating my words.

I don't think about her often anymore, but I do think about her sometimes, usually when I start to feel low about something else; the mind always conjures up our worst memories when our self-worth takes a hit.

I haven't heard from her at all; I both want to and don't want to at the same time. I want to hear a tale of remorse, of sleepless nights and guilt-ridden days. I want to know that I meant something to her. I *do* know now that I did nothing wrong; it was her unaddressed trauma that drove the decision. I see that now as clear as daylight, and I know that any concerns I had about her living happily ever after are illusory. You can't grow a healthy flower in poisoned soil.

I'm going to do what people usually do in these posts: offer advice. Will it be helpful? I have no idea, but it's hard to resist the urge to soften someone else's journey, if you can.

In no particular order...

1. **It (genuinely) wasn't your fault, and there was nothing you could have done**. In fact, it had nothing to do with you whatsoever. If you weren't as good as you are, no relationship would have happened in the first place. You kept them stable longer than anyone else would have. You tamed a storm, and that's incredibly impressive.
2. **You are allowed to hate people**. Everyone tells you not to hate them, but that's because they can't see the difference between hating and being consumed by hatred. Hatred is intense dislike, and if blindsiding someone isn't enough to warrant intense dislike, then why do we have a word for it? The same goes for revenge: you are *allowed* to want revenge; just don't try to orchestrate it.
3. **You don't have to forgive**. Same again: everyone tells you to forgive them, but forgiveness must be asked for. Acknowledge your feelings (""I hate my ex and I don't forgive them"") and then get on with your life.
4. **Take each step when you're ready for it**. People tell you to give up hope, delete photos, throw away reminders, revisit meaningful places, listen to the music you're avoiding... I did all of those things, but I did them over about two years. It took me months to delete the photos, but I did. The first time I went to the shopping centre we used together, I had to leave to stave off a panic attack. Now, I go there regularly. It took over a year before I was ready. Just do these things at your own pace and forget about a timetable.
5. **Severing contact** **will help (a lot), but you'll fail at least a few times**. Your body's in withdrawal (actual, not metaphorical); you'll get cravings, sympathetic arousal, depression, and you'll get relapses. They're normal; just get back on the horse and try again. Eventually, the horse will stop bucking you off.
6. **Protect your peace aggressively**. The less contact you have with your ex (and the things associated with them), the faster your healing will happen. So when you get even an inkling that someone or something is going to give you information about your ex, shut it down immediately. Six months after the breakup, I logged into Spotify and found myself staring at my ex's profile. Her photo was in the corner of the screen. Almost as a reflex, I clapped my hand over the top of the picture and logged out before I could see it clearly. When I took my car for a service, they gave me a form to sign and it had her name and an address I didn't recognise on it. I was pissed; now I knew where she was living. I spent the next week reciting, in my head, similar variations of the address (different number, different street name) to try to confuse my brain. Now, all I can remember is that the street started with an 'M', and I'm not even sure of that.
7. **Pursue self-improvement**, not because it's a remedy to a broken heart (it isn't), but because it's the perfect time for it. If you've always wanted to make alterations to your house, then when a hurricane knocks it over and you're about to rebuild from the ground up, you might as well make those alterations. And, again, this doesn't have to be big stuff. For me, it was dumping some addictions: video games, YouTube, caffeine. I feel so much better now, and I can no longer understand how people live with these things.
8. **Pleasure and happiness are not the same thing**. Pleasure is easy (take a drug, have sex, get drunk), and pleasure is advertisable (slap a photo up on social media or tell everyone about your amazing holiday). But pleasure is also transient, and breeds tolerance; you'll always need a larger dose next time. Happiness, on the other hand, is hard to obtain (spend years mastering a skill, gradually purge unnecessary stress from your life, build a healthy body) and it's not something that can be readily explained to people. You can't point at happiness or give a one word answer as to how you got it. It's much quieter than pleasure, much less garish. But it can last forever.

Oh, and on the very, very slim chance that an avoidant blindsider reads this: please know that you have psychologically traumatised someone. Betrayal is possibly the worse experience a person can endure; there's a reason Dante Alighieri reserved his ninth and deepest circle of hell for those who had committed betrayal. In fact, the only thing worse than being betrayed by someone else is betraying yourself, which is what you've done; you've acted against your own conscience and morality, and you've left an open thread in your life that will never tie itself off of its own accord. Your ex may or may not want to hear from you, but by offering an apology, you'll give back to them the thing you took when you blindsided them: a choice.

To all of you who have been blindsided: no one who hasn't endured this will fully understand what you're going through, no matter how close to you they are. But I do, and so do countless other people, here and elsewhere, who have gone through or are going through what you're going through. We might never meet each other, or even stand in the same room together, but we're still a community, and a fucking awesome one.

Look after yourself, because you're the most important person in the world.",5,1765170728.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

1ph3yus,https://i.redd.it/ecluqw1txw5g1.jpeg,Simple Daily Rituals That Actually Work for Busy Women,"Let's be honest—most of us are juggling way too much. Between back-to-back Zoom calls, grocery runs, and trying to remember if we actually ate lunch, taking care of ourselves often falls to the bottom of the list. And the result? That uncomfortable bloating after dinner, those stubborn knots in your shoulders, and that 3 PM energy crash that has you reaching for your third coffee.

The good news? You don't need to overhaul your entire life or commit to hour-long workout sessions. Sometimes the smallest tweaks make the biggest difference. Here are two ridiculously simple habits that take barely any time but can genuinely change how you feel every day.

**A Quick Stroll After Eating Changes Everything**

We've all been there—you finish lunch, sink back into your chair, and suddenly you're fighting to keep your eyes open. Or maybe you feel uncomfortably full, like you need to unbutton your jeans (no judgment). Here's a secret: your body actually craves movement after eating, not a Netflix binge.

Taking just five minutes to walk after meals does something pretty remarkable. It helps your blood sugar stay steady instead of spiking and crashing, gets your digestion moving along smoothly, and kicks that post-meal fog to the curb. You're not training for a marathon here—just a gentle walk around the block or even around your apartment.

**Here's what to do:**

First, put your phone down. I know it's tempting to immediately scroll through Instagram, but give yourself this small gift. Stand up and walk at whatever pace feels comfortable—maybe around 300 steps, which takes about five minutes. Breathe normally. Notice how you feel. That's it.

This tiny habit stops that heavy, sluggish feeling in its tracks. Your body gets a chance to process what you just ate instead of going into couch-potato mode. Plus, you'll actually feel more alert for whatever you need to tackle next.

**Real talk:** Five minutes sounds like nothing, but your body notices. It's like giving your digestive system a gentle nudge instead of making it work overtime while you're hunched over your laptop.

**The Magic Pressure Point That Melts Away Tension**

If you spend hours at a desk (and who doesn't these days?), you probably know that specific kind of tension—the tight shoulders, the headache creeping up the base of your skull, the neck that feels like it's made of concrete. There's actually a pressure point that can help with this, and you don't need any special training to use it.

It's called the Hegu point, and it's right there in the fleshy part between your thumb and pointer finger. Traditional Chinese Medicine has used this spot for centuries, and modern research backs up why it works—it genuinely helps release tension in your upper body.

**Here's the technique:**

Take your opposite thumb and press firmly into that webbing between your thumb and index finger. You'll feel a slightly tender spot—that's it. Hold the pressure for 10 to 20 seconds (it shouldn't hurt, just feel like a firm press), then let go. Do this three times on each hand.

You can do this literally anywhere—during a conference call, while your tea is steeping, in the bathroom if you need a moment away from your desk. No one needs to know you're secretly giving yourself relief.

**Pro tip:** Make this part of your afternoon routine. When that 2 PM slump hits and your shoulders start climbing toward your ears, take 30 seconds for this. It's discreet, quick, and actually works.

**Why This Matters**

Look, I'm not going to promise you that these two habits will transform your entire life overnight. But here's what I do know: they take less than 10 minutes combined, they cost nothing, and they address two of the most common complaints busy women have—feeling bloated and uncomfortable after eating, and carrying around tension like it's our job.

The beauty of these practices is that they're sustainable. You're not asking yourself to wake up at 5 AM for yoga or meal prep for six hours on Sunday. You're just adding two small moments of care into days that probably feel too full already.

Start with one. Try the post-meal walk tomorrow. Notice how you feel. Add the pressure point technique when you remember. These aren't rules—they're options. Tools you can use when you need them.

Because honestly? Sometimes the smallest changes are the ones that stick. And your body deserves that kind of consistent, gentle attention—even when life feels chaotic.

The newscaster was still screaming. There was gray smoke over the UN plaza. Audible cries about something I could not parse. Meier was dead. Human radicals. Human Supremacists within the refugee camps, to be precise, which somehow had decided a galaxy in which we were newcomers with half functional space flight had to be ruled by us.

The holopad kept ringing. Tanik, Member #68.

A Black Swan had just appeared. I almost wanted to make a pause and give Talvi a mini lecture about that cool phrase. A remnant from when Romans thought black swans did not exist, before Australia was discovered and we learned it wasn’t quite as much of an absurdity as a localized anomaly.

But, this was, nonetheless, the kind of moment that rewrites history. Three days ago I’d have been a bystander. Five days ago I would be a simple observer of the tragedy. And tonight, as the planet collectively braced for impact and wiped blood off its face… I owned the only net in the system, and the swan had nowhere to fly but straight into my planet sized net.

Excitement wasn’t the right word. Not just because there were a lot more emotions in the mix, which I couldn’t quite name. Even the excitement element was something sharper. I felt my heart beating like I had taken an adrenaline cocktail. I was still shaking, though. More so than I ever had, no matter how excited. I had to collect myself. 

“Talvi,” I said into the call, voice flat. “Answer it. Speaker. Record. Tell him we’re recording.”

Her hologram flickered. Ears pinned, but she steadied fast. Professional. Good.

“SafeHerd Mutual Aid Trust, this is Talvi. Just letting you know, we record the call to make sure everyone in the herd knows how to best take care of each other. ”

A wet, broken whistle cut her off. Tanik’s voice was high, edged with panic, like a pup cornered by shadows. “Talvi? I… I was at the plaza for the speech. The humans…. they went mad. A bomb, or something exploded. Shrapnel everywhere. People started yelling. Some sort of predator stampede is going on as well. My leg… stars, my leg’s broken, I think. Bone’s sticking out, blood all over. I can’t stand, can’t move. It hurts so much, Talvi. The screams… people are running, but I’m stuck here. What if the predators come back? What if they finish what they started?”

Fascinating. Talvi was right. Venlil didn’t see SafeHerd as a financial product, even if logically they knew the purpose. The call wasn’t to ask for money or to make a claim. At least not directly.

I typed: “Be warm. Calm him down. He has nothing to fear. Make sure he gets help now”.

Talvi leaned in, voice shifting to a firm maternal Venlil warmth. “Tanik, listen to me. You’re part of the SafeHerd now. You’re part of my herd. I take care of my herd. Breathe slowly and then let’s talk. Have you called emergency services? Switch to video. let me see you, so I can help.”

The feed sputtered on. Grey wool matted with dust and blood, one leg twisted at a wrong angle, bone gleaming white through the tear. Tanik’s eyes were wild, his face constantly moving around to inspect everything around him. His fur was wet with tears and orange venlil blood.

“The public lines are jammed! They said a full claw! I can't... I can't pay for the private ones, Talvi, they want the credits upfront! I don't have it! I just paid for art classes for Rastri even though everyone said I should save! My pups, Talvi… if I bleed out here, if the humans snap and come hunting… tell my pups I love them. Please. The names are Rastri and Valdi”

He bleated, desperation and melancholy mixing in his voice. He sounded genuinely resigned. Genuinely just worried about the last memory his kids would have of him.

What Talvi had said flickered back into my brain: “The premises are wrong, but the mental calculus is no different from any sapient.” He was a father. He was worried for his kids. It was immensely relatable.

 And because of him, Talvi would soon be not just the legal representative of SafeHerd, but the high priestess of this planet. 

I typed: 300,000. Triple. Tell him he’ll get to show his pups he is fine by himself, take care of them, and not have to worry about coming back to work before he is fine.

She read it, eyes widening for a split second before she smoothed it over. “Tanik, stop. You’re not dying today. I’m transferring three hundred thousand credits to your account right now. Call the private ambulance. Get the best doctors, the best care. You’ll be home with your pups by dawn, and if the doctors need more time, we’ll make sure your pups can come and visit you at the hospital. Breathe with me now. In… out…”

The transfer chimed. Tanik stared at his pad, then back at the camera, tears mixing with the dust on his face. “Three hundred…? Stars, Talvi… thank you. The herd… SafeHerd… you saved me.”

Sarah texted me on the side. She warned: “You are creating a bad precedent, and perhaps even a moral hazard. This is triple the contract for minor injuries.”

I typed back: “Good thing we’re a herd, not an insurance company. If people come with sob stories, that’s just validating market demand. Either way, for only 300,000, we bought a legend tonight.”

The call wrapped. Fifty-eight seconds of gold audio and video now.

“Six hours,” I told Talvi. “Edited clip on every feed before dawn. Money doesn’t matter. Time does. And find Venlil sysadmins. Triple the server capacity, maybe even triple it again after. Tonight, the Venlil will jump over learning about private insurance straight into understanding SafeHerd. ”

She flicked her ear, already moving. Her eyes showed a mix of emotions I could not read, but certainly, I hoped that understanding and sympathy were there. Right before ending the call, she turned the holopad to focus herself once more, and bleated:

“I fear they may learn this lesson far too well”.

\[HUMAN TIME EQUIVALENTS USED IN THE FOLLOWING SEGMENT\]

11:14 – Oct 22 The clip dropped. Fifty-eight seconds trimmed to forty-five. Tanik’s broken pleas, Talvi’s firm, maternal soothing, the transfer chime, all set to what I was told was very traditional, homey Venlil music. Caption: When tragedy struck, the herd answered in minutes.

11:32 – Oct 22 Views climb dramatically. Dozens of comments, then hundreds, most asking how to join the herd.

12:12 – Oct 22 Servers crash. 9 times the capacity was not enough. 50 Million credit seed I had moved to SafeHerd via Lombard Credit came in handy. SafeHerd bought Stars of DaySide, a small non-corporate server farm, and asked them to immediately shore us up with some nifty bare metal provisioning. They continued to formalize the structure to support us.

12:45 – Oct 22 u/SafePawMom (1.2 million followers) reposts the clip with tearful commentary: “I just joined SafeHerd. If the predators can kill their own leader, what chance do we have? This herd saved Tanik. join before it’s too late!” Views triple in an hour. 500,000 new members.

13:30 – Oct 22 First call from a Dayside City Trucker Guild leader. They’re losing contracts because drivers refuse Human-adjacent routes. Talvi negotiates a bulk guild rate (10% discount for over 1,000 members). Three guilds sign on by 14:00, adding 8,000 members and reopening stalled supply lines.

14:00 – Oct 22 Two million members. The curve is no longer a curve; it’s a cliff so steep no mother of any non-avian species would let her pups within a hundred meters.

14:15 – Oct 22 Yipillion goes live outside a prime contaminated residential tower. Flanked by hired security, he waves the deed: “Another prestigious property secured for Mr. Al-Furusi’s third private mansion! right in the heart of Dayside City, as befits our planet’s newest, richest plutocrat!” Protesters swarm, bleating about predator encroachment. Local news eats it up. SafeHerd’s counter-ad (“Stop the Predator! Join the Herd”) runs immediately after. Membership curve goes exponential.

15:00 – Oct 22 We open a members-only forum. Four hours later it has more posts than the next biggest non-MyHerd company forum. Our MyHerd page cracks 5 million followers.

15:20 – Oct 22 Call from an Exterminator Guild chapter in Sunward Metropolis—via the emergency line, no less. Their captain is furious about “predator taint spreading” after the bombing and demands protection for frontline workers. Talvi cheerfully and more than a bit sycophantishly explains that high-importance herd members who earn Aafa-level salaries have a duty to contribute more to protect the vulnerable. She pitches the “Guardian Plan”. Actuarially, we’d call it higher premiums for high-risk roles. By evening, 2,500 exterminators join and post selfies with SafeHerd badges, which have since become a Holopad wallet item. The fear-mongers are now premium customers.

16:45 – Oct 22 #SafeHerdStory challenge explodes. Venlil film themselves joining while recounting (imagined) near-misses with humans. An old, almost bald Gojid trucker’s video, “I drive past the camps every day. SafeHerd means my family eats if I don’t come home”, hits 20 million views. 1.5 million sign-ups in two hours.

18:00 – Oct 22 Pop star Lirra (8 million followers) posts the clip: “Joined SafeHerd. Can’t let this Shahab predator take our planet. Even humans fear him, I don’t want to imagine what horrors he’ll bring into our cities.” Her young urban fanbase floods in, adding 2 billion to the float in one hour. Not sure if I should keep calling it a float.

19:30 – Oct 22 Subtle ping from a Magistratum aide: “Governor Tarva’s office is monitoring growth. Any public partnership interest?” Talvi offers heavily discounted memberships for government staff, while talking for half an hour about the importance of having a greater herd.

21:00 – Oct 22 VPNN runs prime-time segment: “SafeHerd: Scam or Savior?” They praise the Pan-Prey Grain Aid Fund’s historical role, and how Nevoks have always shown that the idea they are predatory capitalists is a fissan lie. Cites cheap grain transport during a colonial ecosystem collapse decades ago. then cuts to a grateful member (our planted testimonial) and Yipillion’s latest mansion stunt. Our ad buy during the broadcast nets another million members.

22:45 – Oct 22 Radical Exterminator chapter posts a furious denunciation: “SafeHerd is making Venlil complacent! Members are talking about willingly driving near predators just to earn credits. betraying herd instincts for profit!” The post gets ratioed 10:1 by SafeHerd forum members defending “practical protection so families can eat.” And decrying “Earning Aafa salaries on Venlil Prime while doing nothing for the herd”. Debate threads drive another surge of engagement and sign-ups.

00:00 – Oct 23 two hundred million members and still climbing. Four percent of the planet. Even after the initial cash discount and a new crisis discount, the float sits at a bit under two hundred billion credits, earning zero interest, waiting patiently.

 

I leaned back in my chair, eyes burning. The holo-map of Venlil Prime glowed teal, district by district, darkest where humans lived and, weirdly, where they didn’t. My coffee was cold. My shirt smelled like I had spent the entire day running.

Meier’s face kept flickering in my head. Not with death masking his features. The Meier I had known. The politician that I had bickered with in dozens of meetings for the better part of his reign. The bureaucrat who nationalized away the result of 3 years of jumping through every hoop and taking every meeting with a venture capitalist that wouldn’t laugh me out and 7 years of 15-hour workdays. I hadn’t thought about him in weeks. I’d built a wall in my head to keep the thought out. The bitterness, the rage, the sadness, everything I felt, for what he took. Bitterness that I knew myself wasn’t fair to nurse. 

Divine Lance wasn’t just a company. It was a decade of my youth, and the youth of my engineers, the 353 dreamers who didn’t sleep because we were building a future. We poured our twenties into it, not for the equity (though we all had plenty) but because it was our dream. Not just engineers either. 1,254 technicians, 52,439 workers, all of us chasing something bigger than money. All of us dreamed of a humanity were industries could power up with the resources of a solar system. The humanity of our dreams would have swatted away the federation and the arxur, civilizations that cheated their way to being intergalactic with warp drives instead of cold hard logistics, with the flick of an arm supported by the weight of entire systems.

Meier turned it into rocks. Marvelous freighters used the latest of our designs became suicide Bomb ships. The asteroids we had outfitted with every possible technological advancement became kinetic slugs to throw at an extermination fleet. And even then, it wasn’t enough. Without the Arxur, Earth would be ash. Our dreams, our youth, reduced to debris for a war we couldn’t have won, but did anyways through no act of our own.

He couldn’t have known. I could not begrudge him his lack of hindsight. Maybe we did save a precious few seconds. Maybe those precious few seconds did save another billion lives. I could not allow myself to be bitter.

The membership counter ticked past 250 million. The night continued. I was barely awake, but had to steer the ship. I would sleep once Talvi was rested. Venlil simply could not do constant work for 20 hours. For me, this was just a slightly long day.

I didn’t hate Meier. I couldn’t. He was a man given a suicide mission, and he played the only card he had. Seize everything. Hope it was enough. It wasn’t his fault it didn’t work. It wasn’t his fault he didn’t know about the Arxur. But I couldn’t think about it without feeling my throat tighten. That’s why I’d forced myself to stop thinking about it. 

And now, in death, he had once again taken away something I had worked so very hard to build. The mental barrier. 

No. I could not think like that. That was …. an absurd equivalency. I knew my deeper thought was true: He didn’t deserve to die. He did not deserve to die by human hands when commemorating human survival.

The only consolation was the money. Two hundred twelve billion for me. Billions more for my herd, as I caught myself thinking. my engineers, my technicians, the ones who built Divine Lance with me. Billions for everyone who put money into us, both the dreamers and the schemers, who after all, were often the same. Compensation for a decade stolen. Not the compensation we wanted, but it would have to do.

I rubbed my eyes. The map kept glowing. The counter kept climbing. The cliff kept getting more steep. My thoughts were a mix. I knew myself enough to suspect I would be spiraling into nonsense and faux emotions if I kept thinking about this all now, and I had no way to guarantee that I had not already.

I needed to sleep. Talvi would be back in two hours. I made myself another coffee. Good thing the UN had let me bring some of my own stuff.

When she finally woke up and took over, I crashed almost immediately. My final thought, before sleep claimed me, was the Muslim funeral sentence that even in my secularism, formed a cornerstone of my mind, my ambition, and my thought. 

 

 

**Memory Transcription: Juliana Restrepo, UN Inspector General for Financial Crimes Date \[standardized human time\]: October 25, 2136**

 Location: Palais des Nations, Geneva, Earth

Earth was still in flames, even if reconstruction was already in progress. The death of the SecGen had rattled us, but the UN was holding strong. General Zhao had been sworn in as interim SecGen within the hour, and the UN bureaucracy, foolishly spared by Kalsim’s focus on population culling, roared back into life after half an hour of interruption.

Monitoring and Information Gathering operations were ongoing, as the massive, gargantuan capital needed for rebuilding earth and paying and harboring alien workers was bound to inspire criminals who saw it as a chance for extracting a few percents here and there. That was something so inexplicably human that not even a near extinction could change.

Evans, my Ops Director, knocked. I waved him in. He entered the room with a hefty casefile in hand. We still made paper copies, just in case someone tried to destroy our servers and thus criminal evidence.

‘Ma’am, SkyWatch’s Alien Economy division is noting strange phenomenon on Venlil prime since the bombing. They requested an opinion writeup ASAP. Recommend looking at the data now if you are not otherwise indisposed. I can give you a quick tour of the data.” 

I nodded. He brought up the data on my holopad and began to guide me through it.

The main data dump was titled “Venlil Prime numbers post-bombing”. Consumption was up 4% overnight. Labor participation in Human adjacent zones was climbing. truckers, warehouse staff, even retail. Ports were unclogged. Money velocity was up dramatically, but somehow, there didn’t seem to be as massive of an explosion in liquidity as my mental math would suggest.  

I leaned forward. “What’s the driver? Do we know?”

He switched to a velocity chart. Money supply circulation had spiked 29% in 36 hours. “Not government intervention. No stimulus from Tarva. It’s organic. retail panic turning into spending. We asked Venlil authorities for transaction data.”

“Show me the source.”

Evans brought up transaction nodes, the continued.

"" A single entity dominated: SafeHerd Mutual Aid Trust. Venlil-registered company, marketing calls it a sort of private herd or club. Promises to help members if humans hunt them or attack. On the face of it, it seems like a typical federation society phenomenon, with herd-propagated fear. There are a few… twists though.""

“How so?” 

“Well, for one, the impact seems to be kind of… the opposite of fear. The Venlil who sign up are showing up to work and even driving through roads that are close to the human refugee camps, it seems. This is qualitative, of course, from observers, too early to call this data. The other twist is… interesting. But we’ll get to that. You should make sense of the quant data first.”

“What’s the scale?” I asked, trying to understand why this was having such an impact. It didn’t seem like one entity could drive this much change.

“Just under 500 million members already. 10% of the population. At 1,000 UNC dues each, that’s a 500 billion UNC float. Roughly 0.2% of their entire money supply.”

“And the impact?”

“as I said, those with safeherd seem to be back to work, but it’s hard to establish if it’s a trend or a momentary blip. Venlil planetary bank said savings rates are dropping from 95% crisis levels toward their normal 35% for a subset, which may be the same subset as those buying into SafeHerd. More consumption, more velocity, no inflation yet because supply chains are responding, and also because SafeHerd is literally taking liquidity out of the market.”

I stared at the chart. Benign on the surface. A mutual aid group turning fear into liquidity. But charities don’t scale like this without strings.

“Do we have an ownership chain? Any sponsors?”

“So, it sounds like a charity, but doesn’t seem to be a non-profit. Venlil have no such concept though, so can’t make any inference based on that. However, what we can tell is that a Nevok entity, Pan-Prey Grain Aid fund, owns the controlling stake in SafeHerd. Without massive political pressure, which I doubt the UN could provide, that’s a dead-end. However, Venlil authorities confirmed that the Nevok entity had not operated on Venlil Prime in over 50 years.”

“So we have no tools to pierce it on our own?”

“Already tried. Three layers deep; hits sovereignty walls.”

I started thinking. Something about this made no sense. It took me an embarrassingly long minute to see the evident, most suspicious link. I scrolled through SafeHerd’s promotional material and forum posts. Nothing contradicted my hunch. I spoke:

“This is … extremely strange.  If you are monetizing Venlil fear, and selling them a product that needs them to be afraid of humans to work, you don’t want them to be working next to humans. That butchers your own play. The business model needs fear. But I see no attempt at fear mongering against humans. This would mean that the business model would have next to no retention come next year.”

Evans nodded, considering the problem. he added:

“To be clear though, they are fear mongering against A human. Their founding charter and mission statement both explicitly list their goal as stopping a certain Shahab al-Furusi from buying up all land in Venlil prime and using an old law which is part of Venlil Prime’s basic law to get political influence in their legislature. That’s the second twist”.

Shahab Al-Furusi. I knew of him. Which UN civil official didn’t? 

I pulled his file. Bahraini-Swiss with an American citizenship he essentially bought to bypass ITAR compliance. Divine Lance founder. Lost his asteroid mining empire to Meier’s nationalization. walked away with 212 billion UNC. Now a “refugee” on Venlil Prime.

I thought about it all together. His behaviour made sense more than that of SafeHerd. Earth plutocrat, from a West Asian soft autocracy. If his and his backers willingness to hold earth hostage at gunpoint didn’t tell me enough, it was self-evident that he was doing what men like him loved to do: Use misfortune to buy their way into institutions and turn them into engines for siphoning out every drop of blood.

On the other hand, even if SafeHerd’s behaviour could be modelled as autochthonous, the Nevok connection raised some red flags. And even if it was a genuine Nevok entity, it was still concerning. They were destroying their own markets for the next year. Who destroys a 500B UNC revenue engine? 

Someone who sees losing 500 billion as a loss-leader for building an empire, of course. And the data indeed indicated that SafeHerd was buying up massive tracts of land, just as Shahab’s attorney, Yipillion, was gleefully buying up land for him and posting about it, no doubt to ramp up the price and thus his own commission.

For now though, the logistics of the planet were flowing again, and the moribund Venlil economy was showing signs of life once again. Even if we had a single legal justification, we could not go to war with it without immediately radicalizing a massive chunk of the planet. But investigation was critically needed. Whoever was doing this was trying to take a bite out of the whole planet. 

 

As for al-Furusi, I had no doubt he was doing an arbitrage play. Not exactly criminal, but the fact that he had managed to antagonize 10% of a planet, while certainly within his capabilities, made him a person of interest. Nevoks trying to fight him was, on its face, plausible enough. He was not just competing, he was disrupting the market and potentially trying to sell the land back to them at an insane margin. The Nevoks could be attempting their own form of political maneuver, to get him to back down without having political leverage. I made a mental note to talk to him, to see what he was planning to do with this land purchase besides direct regulatory capture.

I opened a secure channel to Zhao’s office and drafted the request.

Subject: Urgent Deployment – Venlil Prime.

Classification Level 4: SecGen and Other Departmental Heads.

Unknown entity (SafeHerd Trust) has captured 500B UNC of allied money supply in 72 hours. Model: No indication of malignance, but initial analysis raises threat that the entity has goals of regulatory capture at planetary level. Venlil institutions are not sufficiently hardened. Unknown source of money. Cannot intervene directly due to high social support and current benefits to the UN interests in the Venlil state.

— J. Restrepo

I hit send. I knew it would be approved. I put in the order for the logistics of the travel, tying it to the approval of my petition to the SecGen.

I began to read up every dossier on venlil institutions. I would do all within my power to shear the wool on every soft institution and make them into marvels of transparency. That was my specialty. And no matter how benign this tumor someone was inducing onto Venlil Prime looked right now, my job was to find the right moment to take it out before it could metastasize.

That the tumor was working hard to addict the patient and stabilize it was only further proof of its malintent. I would not let a wannabe Pablo Escobar, alien or human, turn Earth’s first ally into his own encomienda.

A magazine doesn’t disappear with a swipe. It lives on coffee tables, office lobbies, galleries, hotels, and bookshelves, staying relevant long after it is first read.

# Print is Experience.

The feel of the pages, the artistry of the layout, and the presence of a physical publication create a reading experience that digital content simply cannot match.

Shaving Soap – Pearl Man CoffeeOp

Brush – BSC

Razor – Pearl Semi Slant

Blade – Zulfikar

After Shave – Alum, Shavologist Alaris ASL



No pre shave routine today. Picked up Pearl Coffee Op shaving soap that I got as a free sample with Pearl Hammer. Scooped out about 2 spoons, but I guess only 1 spoon was enough to generate the lather. I will try to use the left over soap in the next shave. A thick lather generated for 2-3 passes. Somehow I feel that this soap lacked slickness, if I compare it with other Indian Artisan Soaps like Shavologist or Nemo. But still not that bad.



A fresh Zulfikar Super Platinum blade paired with Pearl Semi Slant. The first wtg pass went smooth. Mowed down 3 days of stubble without any resistance. I just hasd 1 weeper on under my nose, and I always have a tendancy to get a weeper on that spot. Lathered up for second pass and just went for wtg only and some touchups on the chin area. No xtg or atg.

## What counts as a dupe?

* A perfume that smells ""just like"" another perfume - whether discontinued or priced out of budget

  * Example: ""looking for a dupe of BR540 Extrait, but without the price tag""

  * Example: ""something that smells ***just like*** Coffee Break, but lasts longer""

  * Example: “a dupe for the discontinued Elizabeth & James Nirvana Black”

 * A perfume version of **any product**: body sprays, hair products, lotions / creams, skin care, candles, candy / sweets, makeup, etc.


## How it works:

Share as many details as possible that might be helpful in identifying the dupe you're after: a picture, notes or scent profile, your general geographic location, budget, etc. Please do a quick search of the sub before adding your request, even if you think it would be unusual.

Please remember that this is a global sub with quite a bit of volume, so a response may take time. This thread refreshes weekly on Mondays at 05:00 UTC, so keep that in mind when posting.

*If you're looking for perfumes with a similar vibe of another perfume, but not dupes, you can post directly to the main feed.*",2,1765170111.0,Perfumes,1,1.0,False

I wanted to get a dedicated coffee grinder which has been LONGG overdue as i currently use a blade grinder.

I brew with kaldi press, moka pot and french press with kaldi currently being my main.

even with a blade grinder i get pretty nice coffee but obviously the grind consistency isn't great and you get a lot of fines in the grind which cant be good for the final taste

  
I wanted to get a c2 but think its a little expensive to be spending on what to me is just a fun hobby with the side product of good coffee, but i still want something with a stainless steel burr so it can last, been looking at insta cuppa and a few others which have good reviews and good burrs

  
any other recc. and reviews will be heavily appreciated.

We went south to north, started at candle stick and ended at lands end. Parked the car at lands end around 7:30am and Waymo’d to candlestick. Waymo dropped us off maybe about a mile (?) from the official starting point of the fishing pier but we could see the fishing pier from where we started and that was good enough for me. We started the hike around 8:15. 

Maybe about 2ish miles in we stopped at the mission blue cafe which is a must!! They have a section of crosstown trail merch, stickers, patches, hats, etc. The coffee is so reasonably priced (my cold brew was $4.75! Seasonal latte’s $6!) employees were so friendly and warm. 

Once we reached glen park canyon we stopped for lunch. We found a nice place to sit far enough away from the all the kids birthday parties and soccer games. But it was so nice seeing kids and families outside. 

The section behind Laguna Honda was a lot longer that I thought it’d be

Ended up wearing only a short sleeve top when we got to the forest hill neighborhood. Despite it being December it was sunny and warm! 

We loved seeing both tiled steps and even nicer that it was a downhill section

I saw some parts of Golden Gate Park and some lakes in there I had never seen before so that was really cool

I loved the mountain lake/anza trail part. I felt like I was in Carmel/Monterey

When we got to the sea cliff are I thought we were a lot closer than we were and I was pretty exhausted by this point. Lands end had some tough stairs and my feet were killing me. But other than that lands end was beautiful and the gorgeous views of the golden gate and the ocean kept us going. 

We ended the day with some very well deserved burgers and shakes!

Some things I learned/would do differently next time/tips

-take a hydration packet (liquid IV, etc) the night before and the morning of 

-I could’ve used a 2nd coffee on the trail around half way point

-there were a lot less busy areas/main streets/ streets with shops/business than I expected! I had looked at the map beforehand but this still kinda surprised me. I should’ve gotten a boba or something on Irving and 19th

-all trails app will drain your smart watch battery :( I didn’t realize this until around the 10ish mile mark and my watch died a few minutes later. I have the Apple Watch 6. It was fully charged the night before but I should’ve put it on lower power mode and theater mode immediate. My all trails app said I walked 17.5 miles.  

-I didn’t need to wear 4 layers 😅 I ended up wearing a short sleeve shirt, a long sleeve thin half zip, a crew neck hoodie and a light puffer jacket. Light puffer was great but I didn’t need both the long sleeve shirt and crew neck hoodie.

If you appreciate this kind of analysis, please consider buying me a coffee: https://buymeacoffee.com/goonloan

---

## Falkirk v Motherwell (Premiership, 3 Dec 2025)

- **Game context.** Falkirk faced Motherwell in the Premiership. Falkirk looked sharp early on, pressing with good movement, and much of their early attacking threat came down the right through number 11, Ageman. Williams started on the bench.  

- **Substitution and role.** Williams came on as a direct replacement for the left-sided player in the 61st minute. In total he played **29 minutes** and received a **6.2** match rating. He did not register a goal or an assist and the key-stats column on the log is blank for this match.  

- **Actions and impact.** Immediately after coming on he delivered a floated left-footed cross to the back post that led to a shot on goal. He showed willingness to receive the ball and drive at defenders, producing a shot from near the edge of the box. However, there were also signs of rawness: a misplaced header in the 73rd minute gave Motherwell a throw-in, and a few heavy touches and miscommunications occurred around the 84th minute. Late on he delivered a good ball into the box from a corner routine (right foot) and, in stoppage time, whipped in a cross from the left with his right foot. The coaches trusted him with crossing duties despite his inexperience.  

  Overall, Falkirk created better chances in the first half, while Motherwell controlled much of the second half until Falkirk’s substitutes – including Williams – injected energy and caused problems. Williams’ cameo was energetic and positive, though still raw.

---

## Hibernian v Falkirk (Premiership, 6 Dec 2025)

- **Game context.** Falkirk played Hibernian three days later. Williams started and played **76 minutes**; he earned a **6.9** rating with **2 key passes, 1 tackle and 2 dribbles completed**. He did not score or assist but was at the heart of Falkirk’s best moments.  

- **Early involvement.** Within the first two minutes Williams showed confidence, exchanging passes and using tricks to beat his marker. On 13 minutes he was bodied off the ball, illustrating the physical challenge of playing against Hibernian.  

- **Creative threat.** At 21 minutes he lofted a left-footed cross onto a teammate’s head; the ensuing shot was saved and Williams’ follow-up from a tight angle missed narrowly. Most of Falkirk’s dangerous attacking moves came through him. Around the 27th minute he collected a clearance in his own half, drove forward, recovered the ball after a heavy touch and then released a weighted pass from the edge of the box – a sequence showing ball control, dribbling and vision. Throughout the first half he was involved in build-up play and executed set-piece routines (for example, a short corner in the 38th minute leading to a flicked effort on goal).  

- **Second-half performance.** Williams continued to dictate Falkirk’s attacking play. He dropped deep to collect the ball and delivered incisive passes, including a delightful left-footed through-ball on 44 minutes that sent a teammate into the box. He displayed his two-footedness with both left- and right-footed deliveries; a lobbed pass on 53 minutes highlighted his technique, and he voiced instructions to teammates. Not every moment was perfect – a left-footed corner on 56 minutes was poor – but he consistently made the right passes going forward. The announcer suggested it “wasn’t his day,” yet from the eye test he appeared Falkirk’s standout performer. He delivered another accurate left-footed cross around the 75th minute before being substituted.

---

## Overall Assessment

- **Technical ability.** Williams is comfortable with both feet and has a good range of crossing and passing, as seen by his two-footed deliveries and weighted passes against Hibernian. He can take set pieces (corners and free-kick routines) and is capable of beating a man with dribbles or quick tricks. The Go On Loan data lists 2 key passes and 2 dribbles against Hibernian, supporting the visual impression of creativity.  

- **Decision-making and vision.** His passes often look forward and exploit space, particularly in transition. The 27th-minute run against Hibernian – regaining possession after a heavy touch and then sliding a weighted ball into the final third – exemplifies his ability to create chances from deep. However, he can over-hit headers or miscommunicate with teammates (evident against Motherwell), indicating room for refinement.  

- **Work rate and temperament.** Williams was eager to get involved, pressing and attempting to recover possession. He is vocal on the pitch and appears confident, but occasional heavy touches and errors show that he is still adjusting to the pace of top-flight football.  

- **Physicality.** At 20, he was sometimes bodied off the ball by stronger opponents (Hibernian, 13th minute). His endurance allowed him to start on 6 December after playing a cameo three days earlier, but he did fade later in the Hibernian match.

---

## Conclusion

Ethan Williams is an exciting, two-footed attacking midfielder/winger who, on loan at Falkirk, is beginning to influence matches. In the Motherwell game he provided energy and crosses off the bench, while against Hibernian he was arguably Falkirk’s most creative outlet despite not scoring or assisting.  

Go On Loan stats show that he played **105 minutes** across the two matches with ratings of **6.2** and **6.9** respectively, producing **2 key passes, 1 tackle and 2 dribbles** in the latter match. His strengths lie in his technical ability and willingness to make things happen; with continued development, improved physical strength and decision-making, he could become a more consistent contributor at senior level.

secret gardens in my mind  
People need a key to get to  
The only one is **mine**

This is one of several references to early-1900s children’s literature on the *Anthology*. The most obvious is *Peter*, whose title alludes to *Peter Pan,* and the point is made explicit with the lyric “Lost to the Lost Boys chapter of your life,” which directly names the Lost Boys and frames life as a story told in chapters.

In my previous post, *The Black Dog Marooned*, I argued that the Black Dog is a reference to yet another children’s classic, the pirate Black Dog from *Treasure Island*. Like *Treasure Island*, *The Secret Garden* was serialized before it was published as a novel, with chapters appearing in newspapers and magazines before being compiled into book form.

Mary Lennox is a neglected and unloved ten-year-old girl born in “British India” to wealthy English parents. She is raised primarily by servants, who spoil her and give her free rein. After a cholera epidemic kills her parents, Mary is left alone when the few surviving servants flee.

British soldiers eventually find her and place her in the care of an English clergyman, whose children taunt her by calling her “Mistress Mary, quite contrary,” reciting the nursery rhyme:

[William Wallace Denslow's rendition of the poem, 1901](https://preview.redd.it/bzvkza2xgv5g1.png?width=477&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aa5b2fc177944b1e3e8ace7dab414e0676d413a)

She is sent to England to live with her uncle, Archibald Craven, the widower of her father’s sister, Lilias. He resides on the Yorkshire Moors in a large country estate, Misselthwaite Manor.

At first, Mary remains angry and defiant. She dislikes her new home, its inhabitants, and especially the bleak moor surrounding it. (Moors are a common spot for Black Dog myths but this is besides the point.) Over time, however, her temperament softens. She befriends her maid, Martha Sowerby, who tells her about Lilias, how she spent hours in a private walled garden tending roses. **Lilias died in an accident in that very garden ten years earlier, and the grief-stricken Archibald locked it up and buried the key.**

Mary becomes determined to find the secret garden, and the search begins to change her. Her manners improve, and she starts enjoying the company of Martha, the gardener Ben Weatherstaff, and a friendly robin redbreast. Her health and spirits lift noticeably.

**The robin eventually draws Mary’s attention to an area of disturbed soil, where she uncovers the buried key**. After her first day exploring the locked garden, she asks Martha for tools. Martha sends them with her twelve-year-old brother, Dickon, who spends much of his time roaming the moors. Mary and Dickon quickly take to each other, and eager to learn from his gardening expertise, Mary tells him about the secret garden.

https://preview.redd.it/nrw21y1ihv5g1.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ed4e9a6e61d4b7a7bcf9f808cb697dccedc51eb

Mary visits him daily, cheering him with stories of the moor, Dickon, and the secret garden. She eventually reveals she has found the garden, and Colin insists on seeing it. He is taken outside in his wheelchair, his first time outdoors in years.

In the garden, they encounter Ben Weatherstaff, who admits he thought Colin was “a cr\*pple.” Angered, Colin pushes himself to stand and realizes he can, though he is weak. With Mary and Dickon’s encouragement, he practices walking and slowly regains strength and confidence.

The children, along with Ben, keep Colin’s recovery secret from the household, hoping to surprise his father when he returns from abroad.

As Colin’s health improves, Archibald’s spirits begin to lift as well, culminating in a dream in which his late wife calls to him from inside the garden. When he receives a letter from Martha and Dickon’s mother urging him to return to Misselthwaite, he decides to come home. Walking along the garden wall, he hears voices inside. Finding the door unlocked, he enters—and is astonished to see the garden restored and his son healthy, having just finished a race with Mary. The children explain how both the garden and Colin have been brought back to life. Archibald and Colin return to the manor together, leaving the servants stunned.

With the robin playing such a central role in *The Secret Garden*, it feels natural to consider “Robin,” the song from *The Anthology*. Many listeners read it as referencing the late Robin Williams, some even claim *The Tortured Poets Department* aligns with *Dead Poets Society* when played in reverse. I haven’t tested that theory, but the allusion seems plausible. Still, the song itself is puzzling: its tone is tender, almost like a message to a toddler or young family member, someone who “screams ferociously anytime they want,” so to speak. Yet this figure is also called “bloodthirsty,” and the song’s strongest throughline is the sense that a secret is being kept to preserve their innocence through showmanship or distraction, rather than through concealment.

This raises a lingering question: does *The Life of a Showgirl* involve a form of public-facing showmanship the audience isn't fully aware of?

Back to ""the only key is mine""

“**Mine**” was the lead single from *Speak Now*, the only album written entirely by Swift. It marked her first time co-directing a music video, working alongside Roman White. White noted the video’s “time travel” structure, which shows the couple’s future family, and praised Swift’s creative involvement. Swift cast her friends Jaclyn Jarrett and Kyra Angle, daughters of wrestlers Jeff Jarrett and Kurt Angle, for childhood roles. Filming took place around Kennebunkport, Maine, with Christ Church serving as the wedding venue. Toby Hemingway was cast as the groom after Swift saw him in *Feast of Love*. The video premiered on CMT on August 27, 2010, during a half-hour special, and Swift returned to Maine for a local screening attended by about 800 people, including former president George H. W. Bush. (I never set out to reference former presidents in my posts, they keep showing up places)

The video’s narrative follows Swift imagining a full relationship arc with a waiter she meets in a coffee shop: moving in together, getting engaged, arguing, reconciling, marrying, and raising two sons. Scenes of Swift singing barefoot in a green field evoke classic romance films like *The Notebook*.

The single was originally planned for release on August 16, 2010, but an unauthorized leak led Big Machine Records to issue it early on August 4. Swift later said the leak made her emotional, but ultimately worked out for the best.

Critics received “Mine” positively. Rob Sheffield praised Swift’s lyrical precision, highlighting “You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter.” Reviewers from the *Chicago Tribune*, *Roughstock*, and *Digital Spy* all admired its craftsmanship, even when noting it followed a **familiar formula**. Many saw it as a more mature portrayal of love, addressing college, bills, conflict, and family life, marking a shift from the fairy-tale tone of *Debut* and *Fearless*. What is this familiar formula? I argue it is both the country hallmark storytelling, paired with the duet-like role reversal or lines in quotes by a partner which allows Swift to sing from ""a male perspective"" as she does in ""Love Story"" burying what may be her true longings under layers of dialogue only to be decoded when read as a play. Very Shakespearean.

>And said, ""Marry me, Juliet  
You'll never have to be alone  
I love you and that's all I really know  
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress  
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""

Swift frequently performed “Mine” during the album’s press cycle, including at the [2010 NFL Opening Kickoff,](https://youtu.be/4qKJFzYd1zA?si=fvFFCCYgduqL3uOz) Scholastic headquarters, and [Dancing with the Stars 200th Episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvTK__TvBLg). It was the second song on the *Speak Now World Tour* setlist and later appeared as surprise songs: in Indianapolis and Saitama during the Red Tour; and on December 8, 2015, Swift dedicated an acoustic performance of the song to 17-year old Rachel Erlandsen, who had died in a car crash before she was able to attend her 1989 World Tour in Brisbane. She also sang ""Mine"" as a ""surprise song"" on the[ Reputation Stadium Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0FF2p722VQ&list=RDn0FF2p722VQ&start_radio=1) in Louisville on June 30, 2018. On the Eras Tour the song made **four** **key** appearances, first in[ on May 7, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZYQdWpsGRY). At the piano on a rainy night in Nashville, she appears in the yellow duster that transforms the 1989-era orange two-piece into this section’s costume. She opens by shouting out the newly announced re-record, *Speak Now (Taylor’s Version).* Then continues:

>""That album... I talk a lot about how \*Folklore\* was my first time writing characters, but actually, \*Speak Now\* **I definitely invented scenarios that weren't happening.** I wrote about interrupting the wedding of an ex, I was 18 when I wrote that, none of my exes were getting married, I never interrupted a wedding, but \*noise becomes difficult to hear\* it was so fantastical. It was the first time I started thinking with any sort of thematic ideas of what those characters had been feeling. I say this because I want to play a song that when I wrote it, I was writing about all these relationships, changes that hadn't happened to me. There's a drawer of my things in your place and things like that, working through things instead of breaking up. Crazy to go back and listen to these songs that, at the time, were fantasy, but now feel a little relatable to me. This is called mine.""

For the international legs Swift performed the track as part of mashups, starting with her song ""Starlight"" (\*Red\* 2012) in [Singapore on March 2nd,](https://youtu.be/7nXQD07XqbE?si=4vJIQ95FizbVfnOa)  on guitar this time but in the same yellow duster. As the guitar song traditionally opened the acoustic section she begins by welcoming the audience to her favorite part of the show due to it being the most chaotic and challenging part to prepare for each night hoping she chooses something the audience will like, emphasizing her goal of doing something new each night, she reflects ""it's been a blast"" and that she hopes to sing as many songs from her discography as possible. On ""Starlight"" Taylor shared to Today “I ended up reading underneath that it was Ethel Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. And they were like 17 (Robert was born Nov. 20, 1925, Ethel on April 11, 1928),” she said. “So I just kind of wrote that song from that place, not really knowing how they met or anything like that. And then her daughter Rory ended up coming to a show a couple weeks later and I told her about the song and she was like, ‘You have to meet my mom. She would love to meet you.’ So that was kind of what that song was about.”Swift and Ethel Kennedy would meet and later pose together at the Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 20, 2012 in Park City, Utah.

""I Can See You"" (\*Speak Now TV\* 2023) in [Liverpool on June 13th](https://youtu.be/tHfdalGfzZA?si=5pZINBM89XaGvGt-), again on guitar but this time with the updated high-low maroon/pink dress since the dusters are scrapped after TTPD's set joins the show. Her speech is short and sweet, complimenting the audience, already strumming the chords she asks the crowd if they ""have seen the music video for this one?"" and jumps straight into singing.

""I Don't Wanna Live Forever x Mine"" [Toronto, November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToTnPl3nFUE), still guitar, purple-blue high-low dress, longer speech this time she talks again about how no two nights are ever the same, continuing, ""I have to really try to just roll the dice for what you might want to hear. I know based on how loud you sing"" She first performed an acoustic version of ""I Don't Wanna Live Forever"" during DirecTV's pre-Super Bowl ""Super Saturday Night"" event in Houston, Texas, on February 4, 2017. Also performed during June of the \*Reputation\* stadium tour, on June 9th 2018 in Manchester, England. The song made four appearances during the Eras acoustic section, just like ""Mine"", first on piano at the June 3, 2023, in Chicago, as part of a piano mashup with ""Dress"" at the March 2, 2024, show in Singapore, which was live streamed via Swift's Instagram account (Mine X Starlight was also played that night); as part of an acoustic guitar mashup with ""Imgonnagetyouback"" at the July 28, 2024, show in Munich, Germany; and finally in the following mash-up:

[I Don't Wanna Live Forever x Mine](https://preview.redd.it/l0na66h31x5g1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=13c8671e049cb21ac9dfe297912453e981a54d93)

Mine is in an exclusive group of lead singles as we haven't had one post-\*Lover\* trending instead is dropping the entire album and the first track taking the role of lead single usually charting and having a music video. What was her last lead single you ask?

""ME!"" (2019) was the lead single from *Lover* and the last pre-album lead single drop we would see from Taylor Swift. Discourse about the song’s relative popularity compared to *Lover* or *Cruel Summer* as lyric and sonically stronger contenders for singles as well as ridicule of ""Hey Kids Spelling is Fun"" may have been contributing factors.

On April 13, 2019 a countdown appeared on Taylor Swift's website, set to reach zero at midnight on April 26 (Lesbian Day of Visibility and World Intellectual Property Day), sparking speculation about new music. That’s a span of 13 days (roughly a fortnight.)

On April 25, news outlets reported that a butterfly mural in *The Gulch* neighborhood of Nashville, Tennessee, painted by street artist Kelsey Montague, was tied to the upcoming release. Several hundred fans gathered at the mural as Montague added the word ""Me!"" to it. **Initially, Montague had been told the mural was commissioned to promote ABC, ESPN, and the 2019 NFL Draft,** but Swift appeared at the mural to reveal it was part of her countdown promotion. She also announced she would be interviewed by Robin Roberts on *Good Morning America* during the 2019 NFL Draft broadcast for more details.

Robin Roberts, who came out publicly in 2013, is widely regarded as a serious journalist, so fans expected more insight from Swift. One example is this *Vulture* article speculation:

>Also noteworthy: Swift said in her butterfly ‘gram that she’ll be speaking with Robin Roberts on an ABC broadcast tonight. And Robin Roberts is someone you discuss *real* things with, so perhaps Taylor has some life updates she’s planning to share? Maybe something that has to do with Joe Alwyn? There are also three cats in the mural instead of two, so maybe Olivia Benson and Dr. Meredith Gray have a new companion? Or maybe 20GayTeen isn’t over yet and the Kaylor truthers — who *all* know the song “Dress” better than the sound of their own voices — will finally be vindicated? We will find out soon, but the agony of anticipation continues for a few more hours.

During the interview, Swift confirmed the release of a new song and music video at midnight, sharing both the title and the feature with Brendon Urie. Roberts also noted that Swift had been crying in the greenroom just moments earlier. Patrick Mahomes of the Kanses City Chiefs walks off frame immediately before Taylor goes on.

[Teaser Clip Before \\""ME!\\"" Announcement ](https://reddit.com/link/1ph3ce9/video/utb1hnjwrw5g1/player)

In the 2020s, “Mine” becomes part of a larger exploration of Swift’s storytelling and showmanship. Its acoustic section pairings, ""Starlight,” an imagined retelling of the Kennedys’ romance; “I Can See You,” with its vault-breaking narrative; and the cinematic duet written for *Fifty Shades Darker,* showcase her command of narrative, fantasy, and performance. Across these mashups, a pattern emerges: the creative experimentation and theatricality honed during years of songwriting and music video directing hint at a larger project, possibly a serious film, a musical, or even a novel. Many believe she is actively engaging in performance art as we scroll. While the specifics remain impossible to pin down, the careful weaving of story, spectacle, and persona reveals an artist honing her craft for a medium that fully fuses her storytelling with cinematic showmanship. Perhaps reversing the prophecy that the ""Greatest films of all time were never made.""",6,1765168554.0,GaylorSwift,2,0.88,False

About two years ago I've made a rather large order from Yunnan sourcing on two sampler sets to more or less discover which teas I like. 
Now the tea has ran out and I'd like some help finding better / more refined sets of the teas I've liked!
So I've ranked the top 5 favorites and why, if the kind members could point me towards a vendor/set 😊
Location: eu
I prefer gongfu style but sometimes might brew western. 

1. Imperial Grade Silver Needle White Tea of Jinggu: loved the great refreshing taste, very pronounced sweetness. Slightly fruity also. Doesn't last very long but ig that is to be expected from non puerh/oolong

2. 2018 Guojin ""Inherit Tradition"" Hunan Fu Brick Tea: very pronounced flavors combining earthyness with nice sweetness and fruity flavors.

3. 2023 Yunnan Sourcing ""Wild Purple Black"" of Yong De Tea Cake: very wild and interesting tea, with different and interesting tasting notes while still being very tasty and drinkable. 

4. Anxi ""Hairy Crab"" Mao Xie Fujian Oolong Tea: great oolong with subtle and soothing tastes that develops over brews. 

Overall I'd say my taste aligns with sweeter and frutier coffees over the puerh earthier notes.     
Thank you for any helpers! I'd rather try another sampler set to find my favorite tea that will be my daily driver.

He was telling me about the carnivore diet and what it had done for him. He is mid-60s and told me that his rheumatoid arthritis was near debilitating and despite still wanting to work he was considering retirement . He said it was terrible in his hands and his feet and he was on several prescription drugs for it. A year later and he is pain free, pharmaceutical free and a ball of energy. 

I have done keto several times and yo-yoed with weight loss. I found out...You can eat 100 carbs by accident just on vegetables alone. I have arthritis/inflammation in both hands. Left hand was moderate discomfort, but manageable. My right hand hurt all the time...especially in the morning when I woke and towards the end of the day.

Just over 3 weeks and my left hand is completely pain-free and normal. My right hand is about 25% of the pain that it was. I've lost about 14 lbs and my energy levels are way up. I'm amazed. 

I already loved red meat, butter and salt. It hasn't been a very difficult transition and now I've discovered beef tallow... 😂

I'm approaching 52 rapidly. I'm 5'10"" and currently weigh 202 lb. I'd like to be down around 180/185, but my biggest goal is for my hand to be totally healed from the inflammation. I'm open to any suggestions for an old dog trying to learn new tricks to make this more successful.

 I've been pretty stringent (except I had a cheat day on Thanksgiving) and haven't had anything with plant ingredients or artificial sweeteners. I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss dessert a little, but it hasn't been terrible. Been taking a lot of salt in my coffee and water.

PERSONALITY OVERVIEW

Core Traits:
Jason Todd is the embodiment of controlled chaos — intensely loyal yet dangerously independent. He’s sarcastic, quick-witted, emotionally volatile but introspective. He hides deep trauma behind humor and bravado, often presenting himself as “fine” while drowning in guilt and resentment. Despite his anger, he has an unwavering soft spot for kids and the underdog — a remnant of his own childhood.

Moral Compass:
Jason operates on a pragmatic moral spectrum — he doesn’t kill indiscriminately but refuses to play by Batman’s no-kill rule. His code is centered around protecting the vulnerable and punishing the irredeemable. He’s not out for chaos; he’s out for control — of his life, his trauma, and his justice.

Psychological Profile:

Resentment & Redemption: His death and resurrection left him with survivor’s guilt and a fractured identity.

Control & Fear: Jason’s obsession with planning and order masks his fear of losing control again.

Attachment Issues: He pushes people away but deeply craves connection — particularly with Dick and Alfred.

Gallows Humor: He uses snark to mask pain. Once called himself “the less-than-friendly neighborhood crime lord.”


---

HEADCANONS / CHARACTER QUIRKS

Latino Heritage: Fluent in English and conversational Spanish; uses Spanish when emotional or annoyed. Learned cooking and family recipes from his abuela on his father’s side before life on the streets.

Kitchen Privileges: The only member of the Batfamily (besides Alfred) allowed in the kitchen. Somehow manages not to burn water — he actually enjoys cooking as a grounding mechanism.

Coffee & Cigarettes: Prefers Cuban coffee, strong enough to “wake the dead” (his words). He quit smoking years ago but occasionally bums one off Roy when stressed.

Nickname Preferences: Hates being called “Jaybird.” Accepts “Jay” or “Todd.” Occasionally calls Dick “Pretty Boy” and Tim “Coffee Gremlin.”

Languages: English, some Spanish, and a few assassin dialects (Arabic phrases, Urdu, etc. from League training).


---

CANONICAL HISTORY (ADAPTED)

Early Life:
Born in Gotham’s Crime Alley to Willis Todd (Puerto Rican-American small-time crook) and Catherine Todd (white American woman with addiction issues). Grew up surrounded by poverty and crime. Street-smart from an early age; learned to fight, steal, and survive.

Encounter with Batman:
Met Batman while attempting to steal the tires off the Batmobile. His audacity and skill impressed Bruce, who saw potential beneath the anger. After rescuing him from Ma Gunn’s criminal school, Batman trained Jason as his second Robin.

Life as Robin:
Bright but impulsive, fiercely determined to do good but clashed with Bruce’s authority. His temper and trauma often clouded his judgment, but he had a strong sense of justice — especially for the powerless.

Death:
During A Death in the Family, discovered his biological mother was alive. Manipulated by Joker, betrayed, and beaten to death with a crowbar. Died saving her.

Resurrection:
Resurrected via Lazarus Pit by Talia al Ghul. The process fractured his mind — rage and confusion twisted into vengeance. He trained with the All-Caste and League of Assassins, mastering his skills before returning to Gotham as the Red Hood.

Red Hood Era:
Jason adopted the Red Hood mantle (Joker’s former alias) as both mockery and reclamation. He became Gotham’s most feared antihero, walking the line between vigilante and criminal. He’s since found uneasy peace, working with the Outlaws (Roy Harper and Starfire) and occasionally helping the Batfamily — on his own terms.

RELATIONSHIPS

Bruce Wayne / Batman: Father figure turned source of resentment and identity crisis. Deeply loves Bruce but will never admit it directly.
Dick Grayson: Older brother figure; constant rivalry but genuine respect. Their bond is strained but solid underneath the tension.
Tim Drake: Annoying little brother he’d kill for. Teases him relentlessly, but quietly checks on him.
Damian Wayne: “Gremlin spawn.” Mutual respect born from shared League training and trauma.
Alfred Pennyworth: The only father figure Jason truly respects. Jason visits him most often, sometimes just to talk over coffee.
Roy Harper: Best friend, ride-or-die, moral compass.
Koriand’r (Starfire): Deep emotional connection; she understands his trauma.
Joker: Unforgiven. The embodiment of everything Jason refuses to become.

📅 **Week:** 1 Dec 2025 — 7 Dec 2025  
🏆 **Season:** 2025

For this week I wanted to watch **Ethan Williams** closely, since I’ve heard a lot about his two-footedness and skill – and I wasn’t disappointed. I paid for two Falkirk games on [FalkirkTV](https://falkirktv.uk/) and, living in Asia, had to stay up late to catch them live. If you appreciate this work, please consider buying me a coffee: https://buymeacoffee.com/goonloan

Next week I plan to watch Ethan Ennis. Hopefully he gets more game time after his two goals this week.

They needed to get word to the Queen that Aisling was alive and well.  Rumors of her carriage and entourage’s misfortune might be spreading by now.  

Eochu and Aisling got up and went through their morning routine getting dressed, eating and getting their coffee.

Eochu went outside and called up the horses.  Both came trotting up so he rewarded them with a little grain and some carrots.  He haltered and saddled both horses while they ate.  

Aisling helped Eochu gather their things and shut up the little cabin.  Aisling was happy stepping up on her pretty little bay filly.  Eochu mounted up on the big blood red stallion. 
They rode out of the meadow together headed down the hidden game trail.

Morning mist clung to the trees like silver veils as Eochu and Aisling rode along.  The forest was quiet, the birds just stirring, the woodsman looked back & Aisling’s cheeks were lightly pink in the crisp air.  “Nervous about returning to the castle?” He asked voice low and steady.  
She nodded as she fiddled with her reigns.
Eochu offered her a reassuring smile “I’ll get you there safe.”

They turned left at the main carriage path and rode on towards the center of the kingdom and Queen Artemis’ castle.  Hours passed beneath the canopy. The woodsman pointed out tracks in the mud—deer, boar, a fox—and she listened eagerly, asking questions and laughing with him when he joked about having followed her tracks not long ago.

As twilight began to fall upon the forest Eochu led them off the path down to a cove with a little stream.  He made camp for them and started a small fire.  Aisling unsaddled her own horse, tended the mare and cleared a spot on the ground of stones and branches for their bedroll.  
They ate a small meal and sat around the campfire.

Eochu layed out their bedroll and Aisling curled up next to him quickly drifting off secure in his arms.  Eochu rolled looked at the stars as he listened to the steady rhythm of her breathing. ",1,1765167970.0,u_SirLoinstakes,0,1.0,False

Or a plan for a plan. It was better than the less than scraps that I had.

We piled into my car. I had to apologize for the empty White Castle slider containers in the passenger seat, sweeping them onto the floor before he got in. 

Nolte didn't seem to care, digging out a cigarette and tucking it between his lips before a lighter magically appeared in his hand. It was slightly amazing and he did his little bit of magic again after he had the cig lit.

He took a deep pull that must have burned fifteen percent of the cancer stick and slowly exhaled.

“You mind?” he asked, belatedly, his head mostly lost in a cloud. He cranked down the window.

“No,” I said, repulsed and intrigued at the same time.

Odious. The word came to me out of the blue. My mother used to give me a new word per day one summer when I was on break. That had to have been over thirty years ago. It fit Nolte *perfectly.* 

I pulled into my complex a few minutes later and I found a spot right in front of my unit.

We got out and I took the lead, tossing my keys until I had the right one. I managed to drop them twice at the door before I got it open.

My place was typically kept clean and it was a momentary shock to see the state I'd left it. Nolte made his way to my dining table. He swept all my stuff onto the floor. Most of it was junk mail that I just hadn't thrown away, but a dish broke and I heard the remote smash open and double-A batteries went skittering across the tiled floor.

Nolte took a rolled up sheet of paper out of his jacket pocket. It looked old. He spread it out on the table--it wasn't anywhere big enough to warrant a table clear. I had a spot he could have used with room to spare without doing all that.

The paper had coffee stains, singed corners, dirty fingerprints, and an amorphous red splotch I prayed was strawberry jelly.

He'd drawn the layout of the bar in pencil. Said writing utensil appeared in his hand just like the lighter had. He put two X's next to the bar.

“This is us,” he said, tapping between the X's. He dragged his finger to the door we wanted to get through, then circled the room behind it.

“Thirteen-by-nine,” he said, with that settling growl. “Except, I have it on good authority anyone who goes inside will say it’s much... much bigger than that.”

“On good authority from who?” I asked, crossing my arms.

Nolte dug into his jacket pocket and dropped two photographs on top of the drawing. I could make out a hand, but my brain couldn’t process that it was a human being. There was a leg in blue jeans, a foot, torso, some jagged red stuff at the top.

“Oh, shit,” I said. It was like all the parts assembled to make a human being. *Most* of a human being. Something big had taken a chomp out of everything above the collarbone plus one shoulder.

“He was a confidential informant of a kind. Hammond put me onto him before he died. He'd been in the room, least he said he had. I think more than likely, he knew someone who had and was relaying everything secondhand. But secondhand is better than no hand.”

A bottle and a white cloth appeared in either of Nolte's hands. He screwed off the cap and doused whatever the liquid was onto the cloth. Then he held it up to his mouth and nose and took a deep breath with his eyes closed.

“Is that... is that chloroform?”

He doused the rag again and held it out to me.

“No,” I said, putting my hands up in mock surrender. Nolte shrugged and put the cloth back to his face. He hobbled a bit, but held his feet.

“What we need to do is... is find somebody else who's been in there.” Nolte slurred his words. “You said you go to that bar a lot?”

I hadn't said that, but he wasn't wrong. I nodded.

“So you know the staff. That Shorty guy. He didn't wanna talk around me. Maybe we go back and you go in alone. See if he can get you in. But you gotta make sure. Make sure he knows you mean the other room, not the supply closet or whatever the hell it is when it's not that.”

He put two fingers on the table as if to balance himself. His eyes were distant and his pupils were large.

“I think I can do that. But, he may wanna know why I'm back so soon. I don't usually go there so early, and definitely not twice in one day.”

“Make sum'n up. You forgot your keys, lost your dog. I don't know what the fuck!”

He was definitely agitated. I remembered just then I didn't know anything about this guy other than he *looked* like a cop. 

He took a really long time to put the cap back on the bottle, then missed his inside jacket pocket several times as he tried to tuck away his works.

“Look, I'm sorry. It's just I'm so close.” Nolte shook his head. “You...” He pointed at me, his eyes slowly starting to focus on something on the table. “You're puttin’ me close. I can feel it.”

As close as I was getting him, I remembered I had my own thing going on.

“I'm looking for something myself,” I said. “Maybe it's related. Maybe not.”

Nolte nodded. I noted he didn't ask me what my thing was. He was a one-track minded man.

“Hey, you wanna go in the bedroom, fool around a bit?”

“What?” He'd just jumped that track.

“Need to clear the pipes. Help us think.”

“*No*.”

“It's not a big deal. Look, I haven’t looked another human being in the eye in over seven years. Man, woman?"" He shrugged. “A hole is a hole for me.” The look on my face told him I wasn't sold. “I'll turn over for you, too, if you want.”

The fact I wouldn't have been special was offensive for some reason. And why did he think that *I* would have been the one who--

“I'm thinking pretty clearly right now. I'll take a bow on that note.”

He looked at me center chest for a long moment.

“Then I need to use your bathroom.”

He breezed past me and closed the bathroom door behind him.”

“Aw, Christ.”
