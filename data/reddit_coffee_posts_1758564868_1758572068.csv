I (27F) matched with a guy (32M) on Tinder last Wednesday. On Thursday, we texted a lot, and on Friday, we had our first coffee date. He‚Äôs nice, funny, respectful, chivalrous ‚Äî he offered to walk me home but didn‚Äôt push when I said no. I felt comfortable with him.

The issue is‚Ä¶ it already feels like too much, too soon:

He‚Äôs very intense with words: ‚Äúmarry me already,‚Äù ‚Äúwhere have you been all my life,‚Äù ‚Äúyou make me feel alive.‚Äù Sweet, but we‚Äôve known each other for two days. Also, he's been calling me stuff like ""my ""something"" for instance i joked about being a witch because i guessed right something about him, so when i said ""I'm a witch"" he said ""MY witch"" and I was like UHM NOPE. 

He texts constantly. Not in a demanding way ‚Äî he doesn‚Äôt guilt-trip me ‚Äî but it‚Äôs a lot. And when he takes a while to respond, he apologizes and explains what he was doing, which I don‚Äôt need.

He overshares quickly. Stories about family, friends, showing me photos, etc. It feels like he‚Äôs opening the whole book too soon.

He already leans on me a bit emotionally. For example, he texted ‚Äútoday‚Äôs not being a great day for me,‚Äù which made me feel like he wanted comfort from me.

He wanted to come with me to a work hangout. At first, I said yes because I got carried away, but then realized it would be weird to bring someone I just met. I told him no, and he took it okay but was disappointed, and even made a comment that rubbed me the wrong way, on the afternoon of the hangout he said ""how you doing?"" And i said ""tired"" and he said ""well you'll unwind later with your friends over drinks"" and I was like... Yeah? I will?? 


The thing is: on paper, yes, I do want to keep seeing him. I like his company and I could see where this goes. But his intensity is overwhelming. I‚Äôm someone who needs space, independence, and a slower pace. Right now it feels like he‚Äôs already putting me at the center of his world when we barely know each other.

So my question is: should I keep seeing him and try to set boundaries, or does this already show we‚Äôre not compatible?

TL;DR: Matched with a guy a few days ago, already went on a date. He‚Äôs nice but very intense (lots of big words, constant texting, oversharing, already leaning on me emotionally, wanted to come to my work event). I like him but I‚Äôm overwhelmed ‚Äî should I keep seeing him and set boundaries, or call it off now?

[Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/s/FcZoR47NRw)

Everyone in town seemed quiet and on edge. Not that surprising, since the visitor who bought a coffee at my shop was found dead in his car. Poor bastard went off the road, tumbled down a steep embankment and wound up lodged between two trees in a forested gully at the edge of town. Hard to say if the fog‚Äôs curse got him or if it was just plain old human error.

Walking into the sporting goods store, I checked out their selection of diving and scuba gear. I couldn't afford a nice set on my meager salary, especially when I had rent to pay, but I was determined to find that sunken ship. Bringing the cheapest set I could find to the cashier counter, I saw the total and knew I'd have to cut back on hot chocolate and pizza delivery.

‚ÄúWe offer scuba instructions, if you'd be interested?‚Äù

The cashier flashed me a cute, although probably insincere smile. I shook my head and walked out a few hundred bucks short for rent. Heading straight down to the beach, I confirmed the forecast was clear on my phone. Changing into the scuba gear inside a nearby public bathroom, I approached the boardwalk where my neighbor David waited with a boat.

‚ÄúAlright, JJ. It cost me about three hundred to rent this puppy for the day, so are you ready?‚Äù

I nodded and climbed aboard. Sailing out to the rock formation where the Butterscotch sank, he began talking about how I'd have to pay him back, but I couldn't hear him so well over the wind blowing across my covered ears.

Rising from the sea like a mighty spire, the rock formation swelled the waves around it. He brought the boat as close as he could and gave me a thumbs up. Double checking my oxygen tank, I stowed my fears and plunged into the freezing water. Activating the powerful water proof flood light I bought with the scuba gear, I descended into the ocean depths.

It must have been at least five hundred feet before I touched down on the sandy floor. Schools of fish swam around patches of seaweed, flowing with the current and feeding on plankton particles. The shadow of a huge shark darted over nearby, making me wish I had bought a harpoon gun. Navigating the deep waters, I traced long zig-zagging paths as I searched for the sunken Butterscotch. I kept a close eye on my air gauge, making sure it didn't drop below a quarter.

After about twenty minutes, I found it. Her rusted hull rose from the sands, almost blending in as natural rock. The rip in her aft starboard must have landed face down, because I couldn't see any discernable damage. Swimming closer to the vessel, the water around me seemed to grow colder and colder. Debris began littering the sands underneath me, telling a story of chaos through fragmented hull pieces and buried shipping containers.

Swimming up to the lopsided deck, I froze in place when the sight of dead, badly decomposed bodies floated around the ship. Some hung from railings, others caught on wire running down from the central mast. An unsettling detail I observed was the fact some bodies were nothing more than chipping skeletons, while others were alarmingly fresh with soggy, pale skin.

Suddenly, the waters around me became significantly darker. Looking up, I noticed sunlight no longer breached the roaring waves. That couldn't be real, because the forecast said it was clear and I only had about an hour of oxygen in my tank. Panicked, I swam up and felt my heart just about stop when I realized what was going on. Thick fog had covered the ocean's surface.

Staying submerged, I searched for David's boat, hoping he'd do the smart thing and just leave me behind. With my oxygen more than halfway depleted, I weighed the options of drowning or surfacing to expose myself to the fog. Ultimately, I decided the smartest move would be to swim for the shore.

David's boat became visible, making my heart sink with dread. Swimming up to it, I tapped on the underbelly of the hull while staying submerged, hoping he would hear my attempt at communication. That's when a hand grabbed my leg.

If it wasn't for the scuba mask, I would have uttered the loudest scream of my life. David's lifeless, pale corpse was latched on to my leg, staring at me with those haunting black eyes. Recoiling my leg, I kicked David or whatever it was that looked like him squarely in the face, over and over again until it let go. Finally, the corpse lost its grip and sank into the depths, disappearing into inky darkness.

Leaving the boat behind, I continued to swim just underneath the surface on my dwindling oxygen supply. By some miracle, the fog hadn't quite touched down on the beach, allowing me to unceremoniously wash up on the shore like a beached whale. Ripping the mask off, I sprinted inland before the fog got any closer. When I got home, my father sat waiting for me in the kitchen with a scowl across his face.

<‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>

After changing into clean clothes, I sat down on the couch and waited for him to say something. I wasn't very thrilled that he showed up unannounced, but I didn't have the courage to tell him to leave, either. He was a scary man when he got angry, that much I could remember from when he beat my mom.

‚ÄúWhat did you do, JJ?‚Äù

His grumbling voice caught me off guard.

‚ÄúNothing, why?‚Äù

‚ÄúStop lying, son. There was no fog in the weather forecast, so why did it roll in? People all over town had to cancel their plans and scramble. What did you do to upset them?‚Äù

Staring with a blank expression, I considered making up a bold lie, but ultimately decided against it.

‚ÄúWell, I rented a boat and took a diving expedition to see the Butterscotch. The fog seemed to‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou WHAT?‚Äù

Bursting forward in his chair, my dad stomped forward and grabbed me by the collar. His face flushed red as spittle flew with every syllable:

‚ÄúBoy, I have HAD it with your dangerous investigations! You're just like your MOTHER!‚Äù

Letting me go, he ran over to the red landline phone, ripped it from the wall and threw it full force at my kitchen window. Cracks spiraled in the glass from the impact.

‚ÄúGet out, or I'm calling the cops!‚Äù

Glaring with fierce malice in his eyes, my father stood huffing for a few seconds before slamming the door hard enough to warp the wood trimming on his way out.

I sat in silence, processing what just happened. What did he mean I was like my mother? Did she try to investigate our town‚Äôs curse after Aria disappeared? Could she have discovered something? There was only one way to find out. Taking out my cell phone, I dialed up the sheriff's office.

‚ÄúYeah, I'd like to press charges on my dad for property damage. Can you send someone out here when the fog blows over?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, can you just provide us with an address, sir?‚Äù

As I rattled off my street number, I remembered that David's boat was still drifting out there. On the off chance I hallucinated the corpse grabbing me in the water, I told them to send someone out to look for my friend.

While waiting for them to arrive, I took pictures of the damage and filed a report with my landlord. Luckily, I still had the recording devices set up outside my door, which would be damning evidence against my dad considering it picked up his outburst.

<‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>

It didn't surprise me much when my dad refused my offer to look after the house when he got locked up. That didn't matter though, because I grew up in that house and knew how to sneak in through the garage window. All I needed to do was stack a few empty boxes along the side of the house and suck in my gut.

It shocked me how little the place changed. That old, ugly brown floral couch still faced the fireplace. He still had the same kitchen table with little lines and rivets etched into the wood from my sister and I cutting it with silverware. The only thing that changed was my bedroom, it was totally empty and stripped of carpet.

Stepping into my parent's old bedroom, I began rooting around in their dresser and closet, looking for anything my mom might have documented. I knew there was a good chance my dad erased anything she might have saved, but it was still worth a look. The only thing worthwhile was my mother's diary, which sat in a dusty corner of the closet.

Taking it to the kitchen table, I flipped through page after page of mundane writing. Things like my mom's opinion on politics or personal grievances she had with friends. Near the end, something about her writing changed. It must have been around the time Aria was exposed to the fog, because all she would write about was her worry for the child. It was the final entry that piqued my interest:

*My husband walked inside from the fog today. Nothing about him seems different, so how long has he been keeping that secret? I asked him what he was doing, but he just said he went out looking for Aria again. In a black suit and tie? With our town‚Äôs plague hanging in the air? I don't believe him. It bothers me that his father's death seems to be hitting him harder than losing Aria.*

It dawned on me that my dad had mentioned my grandfather before, when he was drunk the night I asked him to keep me company. Closing the diary, I knew my next objective would be to learn more about my grandfather‚Ä¶ a man my dad never spoke about growing up. I suspected my dad wouldn't be eager to volunteer any information, especially after I got him locked up, so I'd have to do my investigation elsewhere.

<‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>

Pouring through pages of mortuary records and phone book listings, I searched for people with my last name. I could only hope my grandfather didn't decide to change up the family surname when my dad was born. I wrote down a small list of possible names and prepared to head back home.

‚ÄúAh, sorry JJ, the fog rolled in while you were reading. A few of our guests are making themselves comfortable in the library's meeting room if you want to crash there for now.‚Äù

Glancing through the rotating glass doors, I confirmed she was telling the truth. Taking in a deep breath, I smiled and gestured to the back of the library.

‚ÄúI'll probably just hang out back there, if that's okay?‚Äù

She returned my smile and nodded. Truthfully, I just didn't want to be near other people in case any voices or apparitions tried to torment me. Taking a few books to a lounge chair in a cozy corner of the library, I sighed and tried to relax. My effort paid off, since I nodded off to sleep halfway through reading a book.

I awoke to a hand shaking my shoulder. Before I could fully wake up, I immediately noticed the air felt extremely cold. Locking eyes with a strange man in uniform, I realized I was no longer in the library.

‚ÄúWake up, we have to get topside and board the lifeboats!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat's going on?‚Äù

My voice didn't sound like it normally did. Looking around, I seemed to be inside a large metallic chamber, like the cargo hold of a ship. A loud alarm screeched in the background.

‚ÄúJust follow me, we've gotta get the hell outta here!‚Äù

The man turned and sprinted down the chamber. Before I could get up to follow, a thunderous crash of water exploded from several hallways further up the chamber. The man who shook me awake was engulfed in seconds, swept up with large cargo containers and other large pieces of equipment. Raising my hands to protect my face, I screamed and waited for the water to crash into me and end my life, but it never came.

‚ÄúJJ, what's wrong with you, are you okay?‚Äù

Lowering my hands, I saw the young receptionist staring at me with a hand over her mouth. I was back in the library‚Ä¶ warm, dry and safe. Glancing out of a nearby window, I saw the fog was starting to evaporate.

‚ÄúUgh, yeah, I'm fine. Just had a nightmare, that's all.‚Äù

<‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>

Sitting down at my kitchen table, I began researching all the names I scribbled down on my phone. It didn't take too long to confirm my grandfather's identity through old public records, but finding any real information on the man was very difficult. All I could dig up was his gravesite, an old career record with the navy before my dad was born and a few living relatives.

Grandpa Harold had one living sister who lived way across the country. Looking her up in the phone book, I dialed her up and hoped for the best.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

‚ÄúHi, is this Elizabeth?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes? Who's this?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm JJ, your brother's grandson. Would it be okay if I asked you a few questions about Harold?‚Äù

She went silent for a moment, breaking into a fit of soft laughter before continuing to speak in her raspy old voice:

‚ÄúOh my, I didn't think Harold had a grandson! That man just didn't share anything with the world, you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, yeah, my father is the same way. Apple doesn't fall far, I suppose. Well, anyway, do you know much about Harold‚Äôs life? Like, where he worked or anything like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, sure, I'll tell you a bit about my brother. Served the navy for a few years then got a job operating a lighthouse in a little town. That must have been a hard job on poor Harold, he never spoke to the family much.‚Äù

She continued to rattle off about her brother's early school years and fond memories of seeing him during the holidays, but I zoned out after hearing the bombshell she dropped. My grandfather was the lighthouse operator, therefore he was responsible for the Butterscotch's demise.

‚ÄúThank you for your time, Elizabeth. I have to go, but I'll keep in touch with you. I've been meaning to reconnect with extended family.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, JJ, it was nice talking with you. I'll take your call anytime, dear. Life in this retirement home couldn't be any more boring, after all!‚Äù

She gave another soft laugh and we said our goodbyes.

<‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>

Paying my father a visit in jail, I picked up the phone and glared at him through the glass separating us.

‚ÄúWhat do you want, JJ? Haven't you fucked me over enough?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know about grandpa, dad. He was the lighthouse operator.‚Äù

Leaning back in his seat, he dusted something off the orange leg of his jumpsuit and shrugged.

‚ÄúOkay, took you long enough to figure that one out. Why tell me about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know why this town is cursed, dad, and you seem to know how to get around that curse. Don't you want to share that secret with the world? Stop people from dying and losing their minds?‚Äù

He smiled and set the phone down for a moment. Eying the clock, I estimated we had about a minute left on our visit.

‚ÄúIt's not that easy, JJ. Believe me, I'd have done so already if it was.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't understand, dad. Why can't you give me any answers? If the world can't know, why not your son?‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, you remember how the note you found said faith protects the mind?‚Äù

Narrowing my eyes, I responded with a slow nod.

‚ÄúNext time you see them or find yourself in a dark place, just pray to the lord for light to guide them. There is no cure or solution to walk through the fog unphased, JJ. If I tried to explain why I can, you simply wouldn't understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúTry me, dad.‚Äù

Two officers walked up behind him and said something I couldn't hear.

‚ÄúWe're out of time, anyways. I'll make things right when I get out of here, okay? Just stay safe for now, JJ.‚Äù

<‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>

David's funeral passed by with solemn words and sobering moments of grief from his loved ones. I couldn't help but feel like a third wheel in a way, since my invitation was mostly due to our final moments together at sea. Angry glares from his parents and siblings didn't help a bit, so I paid my respects and went on my way.

Since I was at the graveyard, I decided to pay grandpa Harold‚Äôs tombstone a visit. It was caked in dirt and overgrowth, so out of respect I took a moment to clean it up the best I could. There was a picture hidden in the tangle of weeds.

It was a black and white photograph, depicting a younger version of my dad and who I assumed to be grandpa Harold. They stood in front of the lighthouse, dressed in nice black suits with a Bible in their hands. I noticed the property around the lighthouse seemed much more tidy and well kept in the photo.

‚ÄúSomeone should clean up that place, it's a shame to see it in such a pitiful state.‚Äù

Pastor Mark surprised me when he spoke, catching me off guard as I turned to see him looking over my shoulder.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing out here?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust paying respects to David with a final prayer, that's all really. Couldn't help but notice you were taking care of your grandpa's grave.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou knew Harold?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot particularly. I was closer to your dad when we were kids, Harold was more like a grumpy adult the neighborhood kids didn't like. He'd always get snappy when we‚Äôd get mischievous and snoop around the lighthouse property.‚Äù

Looking down at the photo, something dawned on me. Pastor Mark couldn't be more than my dad's age, which meant the lighthouse was fully automated around the time he'd be a kid wandering around the neighborhood.

‚ÄúWait a minute, why did Harold keep working at the lighthouse if it was automated in the late 60‚Äôs? Weren't you and my dad born in like, the early 70‚Äôs?‚Äù

Mark's brow twitched up and he flashed a coy little smile.

‚ÄúWell, Harold had a sense of responsibility and ownership for that place. The old man didn't want to give up looking after the property, even after they sacked his job. He'd cut the grass, trim the weeds and just make sure the place looked nice and tidy.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm, grandpa sure seemed like a hard working man, I'll give him that.‚Äù

Mark took a few steps closer and put a hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúJJ, not many people believe me when I say this, but you've got a good head on your shoulders, so let me fill you in on a little secret. When Harold got too old to upkeep the lighthouse, I noticed we started getting a lot more foggy weather throughout the year. Call me crazy, but I think whatever is out there cursing the fog is angry that the lighthouse has fallen into a state of disrepair.‚Äù

Staring down at our feet, I considered the pastor's words and nodded in agreement.

‚ÄúWell, next weekend I'll bring some gardening tools and fix up the yard. Who knows, maybe it'll help.‚Äù",1,1758571115.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

How do you get over feeling dejected from endoscopy results? 

I was diagnosed with IBS years ago, when I was 13. Annoying but whatever. Then in May, at the grand age of 18, everything just went downhill. Vomiting blood, coffee ground stool, severe acid reflux, difficultly swallowing, I couldn't and still can't go for a poo without a suppository. Appetite non existent, low iron, the works. I've lost over 4 stone since June as I can only eat a bowl of soup a day. I get very gassy and bloated even with just this and I feel full to the point of sickness. Way under 300 cals a day for the last 3 weeks.

I finally got my endoscopy through, went in and did it. Terrible experience (Sedation and throat spray didn't work on me so I felt everything and remembered everything, my veins were all collapsed). The results just made me so dejected and sad. 

Polyps in my stomach that they believe are due to me taking omeprazole (Didn't biopsy for that reasons)
And Grade A tears in my esophagus

They couldn't find anything that was causing my symptoms. I just feel sad, a bit angry and a weird bit of grief. And so fucking scared.

How am I meant to go on if I can't eat anything? If I'm starving basically? If none of my body is working properly?

Yes, maybe this is my IBS, but I need something, anything to help me be a normal person or a semblance of one.

I'm still waiting for an abdominal scan to come over the next few weeks. I don't have a gastro appointment until December. That's two months of this. Two more months ths of pain and barely living. I've just turned 18 this year and I've not been able to do anything

I'm meant to go on holiday next week. Holiday is a time for fun and to eat more food that you can manage usually...food is the best part of a holiday...
Yet I won't be able to eat anything. I watch my family get so excited of the food available, the food they can eat...and Im just stuck here...starving as I can't swallow anything that isn't liquid without struggling and throwing up.

How do I live like this? How can I grieve the endoscopy results while being glad it's nothing serious? 

All the signs point to something serious. I suddenly become badly anemic after two months (Two blood tests, two months apart), for a while I went yellow in the skin as well but that seems to have gone away. How do the signs point to something but the tests have no answers? Just affects from my symptoms?",1,1758571085.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

Several years ago, while traveling alone in Canada, I happened upon another backpacker on a hiking trail in the Rocky Mountains. Along the way, we shared stories of our lives and dreams‚Äîfrom tales of our hometowns to future plans. We even shared a simple meal of bread and coffee in the cool mountain breeze at the summit. That brief encounter taught me how the warmth of human connection can provide strength and inspiration even on unfamiliar ground. To this day, whenever I recall those snow-capped peaks and the laughter we shared, my heart still fills with tenderness and gratitude.



In daily life, I love hiking, savoring the process of stepping into nature one stride at a time; I adore golf, not for scores but for the focus and tranquility of the swing; I enjoy cooking, transforming simple ingredients into a warm meal to share with loved ones; and after a busy day, I often unwind with music, immersing myself in melodies to find moments of inner peace.

I'm Jas, and I'm **urgently** looking for a roommate to share an apartment with in Brooklyn!

I'm 30, and have lived in NYC for a few years. I work as a model and server, so I'm usually out during the day and on weekend nights. I love cooking, working out, trying new coffee shops and restaurants, exploring the city, and movie nights! I don't bring the party home. I believe in keeping the common areas clean but I realize life happens and sometimes it may take longer to do so. I'm down for being social and hanging out at home or going out for lunch/drinks, but I also value personal space.

I have a small,¬†**12-year-old senior dog**¬†who is super chill and mostly just naps, only barks when someone's at the door.

1nnwrdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1nnwrdm/tifu_by_replying_all_on_a_friday_and_accidentally/,TIFU by Replying All on a Friday and Accidentally Roasting My Boss,"So this actually happened on this Friday, and honestly, it couldn‚Äôt have been worse timing. I had been looking forward to a relaxing weekend, but instead, I think I just created the perfect storm of embarrassment......
It all started with one of those long, painfully corporate emails from my boss. You know the type: dense paragraphs, full of jargon, and somehow making a short update feel like a 500-page thesis. This one was brimming with phrases like ‚Äúsynergize deliverables,‚Äù ‚Äúoptimize verticals,‚Äù and ‚Äúpivot proactively to maximize cross-functional efficiency.‚Äù I was already exhausted, coffee had barely kicked in, and I just wanted to vent about it to my coworker.

So naturally, I highlighted the email, hit forward, and typed:

>I laughed to myself, thinking my coworker would get it, we‚Äôd share a moment of Friday humor, and life would go on.

Except‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt hit forward. I hit Reply All.
At first, I didn‚Äôt even realize. Then, within seconds, the horror hit me like a ton of bricks. My boss. HR. Every single employee in the company. All 247 of them. They just received my brutally honest commentary about my boss‚Äôs writing. My stomach dropped.

The panic set in immediately. My phone started buzzing like crazy. Teams notifications, pings, direct messages - all within a minute. HR pinged me first, asking if I‚Äôd like to schedule a ‚Äúbrief conversation‚Äù about the email. Then my boss replied with three simple, ominous words: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs discuss.‚Äù
Friday had officially gone from casual end-of-week vibes to full-blown nightmare mode. I tried to disappear into my chair, slouching as far as possible, hoping nobody could see me. My coworker? Sitting across from me, trying to look innocent but clearly silently dying of laughter.

For the next hour, I rehearsed my apology speech in my head. I imagined worst-case scenarios: being reprimanded, a formal warning, HR interrogations, or even some kind of Friday afternoon public embarrassment. My mind raced: Should I own up? Should I lie and say I ‚Äúaccidentally clicked Reply All‚Äù? Would that even make a difference?

Then came the meeting. My boss called me into a small conference room. I walked in like I was attending my own trial. Heart pounding, palms sweaty. I expected anger, disappointment, or at the very least, a pointed stare that could pierce steel.

But instead, my boss started laughing. Like full-on, uncontrollable laughter. Not the polite chuckle you give when someone tries to be funny in a meeting, but genuine, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this actually happened‚Äù laughter. I blinked, completely shocked.

He wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs one way to summarize my email.‚Äù

I felt a mix of relief and confusion. Was I really going to survive this? But then came the kicker- karma, of course, in true Friday style: Since you clearly have strong opinions on corporate writing, you‚Äôre now in charge of drafting next week‚Äôs company-wide email.

I froze. So, not only had I roasted my boss in front of the entire company, but now I was responsible for writing the next email they‚Äôd all read. On a Friday. Of course.

Walking back to my desk, I reflected on the lessons I learned:

1. Never assume you‚Äôre forwarding something when you‚Äôre actually replying all.
2. Fridays are dangerous for mistakes - everyone‚Äôs already checked out mentally.
3. Humor can sometimes save your life‚Ä¶or get you assigned extra work.
4. Coffee should always be your first line of defense in the morning, and maybe the afternoon too.

I sat down, trying to breathe, checking my Teams notifications, imagining all the possible ways people were reacting. Some were laughing, some were probably judging, and some were probably just confused about why ChatGPT had a stroke. My coworker kept giving me side-eye grins, clearly thrilled that my disaster had turned into some kind of Friday office entertainment.

As I start thinking about next week‚Äôs email, I realize I‚Äôve learned something crucial: embarrassment is temporary, but karma‚Ä¶well, karma is hilarious. Also, Fridays are a dangerous time to roast your boss, even accidentally.

TL;DR: It was Friday. I meant to forward a company-wide email to a coworker with a roast about my boss. Accidentally hit Reply All. Boss and everyone saw it. HR pinged me. Boss laughed, but now I‚Äôm in charge of writing the next email. Fridays are dangerous.",0,1758570937.0,tifu,4,0.2,False
1nnwrci,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nnwrci,Breathtaking solo trip to New Mexico,"In the beginnings of New Mexico from Texas, small shrubs dotted flat land to my right and left. Shy yellow wildflowers peeked through tall, shimmery grass. Looking ahead, blue-grey gradients on the horizon proved higher ground wasn't far.

Plains became hills, and more greenery showed.

The hills grew larger, and I was in their valleys. The green was vibrant and red-brown dirt was visible in its negative space.

Getting higher, the formations around me became bald. Creamsicle rock created peaks against the cloudless sky. Still, a scatter of pi√±on covered the skirt of them.

After a longer stretch, I was closer to the clouds. Grassy slopes boasting bunches of rabbitbrush and purple aster were the foreground for tall, amber-barked ponderosas. In the distance, burn scars along the mountaintops contrasted the life around them.

Following the Jemez River through sun-bleached pastures, once sparse conifers soon became forests surrounding wide valleys. Dense patches of trees with old, drooping foliage made shade in the harsh middle-day. Newer, shining pines were sprouting from the ground. The stream glittered with the sun. It didn‚Äôt narrow, or widen, and it seemed to never end.

I settled for the night on a soft pine needle floor adorned with cones.

Waking to the crack of the forest floor and scattering wildlife feet, my breath touched the air around me and showed. I quickly bundled myself and brewed coffee with cream. A steam cloud rose over my campsite. Orangey morning sun peeked through the tree-blinds, over the hillside, and shone into my face. Quietness remained beside birdsong and the sip of my mug.

With a heavy pack in tow, and layers of warmth, I walked through vanilla woods. The forest was showered in velvety morning sun; glossy leaves at my feet reflected a hot white light. For miles, I sang to myself, and I thanked the forest for her beauty. I told her how grateful I was to smell her scents and to feel her breeze.

The hike became tough, and I persisted through rocky, steep trails. Wool and cotton were packed away as the sun warmed me. Coming upon a stream that I heard before seeing, I followed it skyward.

There, in the hollow, two pools of clear water were fed by a warm, bubbling spring. The first was shallow and cascaded down by waterfall into the next. Terraced below, a deeper bath sparkled with the sun. Tall, purple-white flowers pushed through grassy patches that embellished its borders. Mountain peaks stretched for miles ahead. I cried and repeated to the forest how beautiful she was.

I soaked in the soft spring water. I showered in the sunlight. I laid on the tree roots. I was barefoot on pillows of fallen pine needles. I breathed in the incense of the trees, and the earthiness of the dirt. I stayed until my hair had been wet and dry 3 times over.

Traveling through the high desert, along the Rio Grande, walls of maroon boulders crowned by juniper savannahs made an impressive show of color. Deep purple stone, khaki pathways, and many shades of green: ashy sage brush, evergreen juniper, river water. And, again, the bouquets of yellow wildflowers- like colored buttons or stitching on an otherwise bland blouse.

Just before sunset, my shelter was made atop these heights with a sweeping view of the gorge. The sun hid as I sat on its edge and admired the glittering ribbon of water below. By dark, supper was heating on a snapping fire. I bathed in its warmth and thought of tomorrow. A cigarette was rolled. Under the new moon, hidden stars shone, and the milky way glowed viridescent behind my plumes of smoke.

Cozy in wool, a late morning brought an unforgiving sun. The short, shrubby trees of the area provided no respite. I got up with promises of another soak and packed in a hurry.

Silvery sage meadows covered the fields around me and reflected the morning heat in every direction. I walked through farmland. Black cows lounged near the fence line of healthy pastures ornamented by a backdrop of the range. Modest, tan houses sat on their ranches. A bit further, and I was now face to face with the canyon- and the big purple boulders I had marveled at before.

A short descent of the rocky hillside left new scrapes on my boots. Hidden from the bend, three pools of different depths sat next to the calm Rio Grande. Steam rose off shimmering black water. Despite my lateness, everyone else was just as such. I had the hot spring to myself. I floated and sighed for my last moments in the state.

On my departure, the sky became dull, and raindrops fell one at a time at first, and then with no mercy. Serpentine roads revealed a tarot of fall colors. Yellowing leaves and red bushes were hard to miss against nature‚Äôs blanket of green. Before long, oak, mesquites, and cedar fences framed my route. The air was thick and warm. I had reached familiar Texas plains by dusk. ¬≠¬≠

\----

TL;DR / This was my first time in New Mexico. I visited the Valles Caldera, Santa Fe Ntl. Forest, McCauley Warm Springs, Carson Natl. Forest, and Black Rock Hot Springs. I was astounded by the diversity of the landscape here and how much some parts reminded me of West Texas. I‚Äôd never seen anything like the burn scars in the Jemez area. I also learned that high elevation affects me; I had to catch my breath much too often on this trip. I had an incredible time! Thank you, New Mexico.",20,1758570935.0,camping,0,1.0,False

[Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/s/neCqkR8B9C)

Everyone in town seemed quiet and on edge. Not that surprising, since the visitor who bought a coffee at my shop was found dead in his car. Poor bastard went off the road, tumbled down a steep embankment and wound up lodged between two trees in a forested gully at the edge of town. Hard to say if the fog‚Äôs curse got him or if it was just plain old human error.

Walking into the sporting goods store, I checked out their selection of diving and scuba gear. I couldn't afford a nice set on my meager salary, especially when I had rent to pay, but I was determined to find that sunken ship. Bringing the cheapest set I could find to the cashier counter, I saw the total and knew I'd have to cut back on hot chocolate and pizza delivery.

‚ÄúWe offer scuba instructions, if you'd be interested?‚Äù

The cashier flashed me a cute, although probably insincere smile. I shook my head and walked out a few hundred bucks short for rent. Heading straight down to the beach, I confirmed the forecast was clear on my phone. Changing into the scuba gear inside a nearby public bathroom, I approached the boardwalk where my neighbor David waited with a boat.

‚ÄúAlright, JJ. It cost me about three hundred to rent this puppy for the day, so are you ready?‚Äù

I nodded and climbed aboard. Sailing out to the rock formation where the Butterscotch sank, he began talking about how I'd have to pay him back, but I couldn't hear him so well over the wind blowing across my covered ears.

Rising from the sea like a mighty spire, the rock formation swelled the waves around it. He brought the boat as close as he could and gave me a thumbs up. Double checking my oxygen tank, I stowed my fears and plunged into the freezing water. Activating the powerful water proof flood light I bought with the scuba gear, I descended into the ocean depths.

It must have been at least five hundred feet before I touched down on the sandy floor. Schools of fish swam around patches of seaweed, flowing with the current and feeding on plankton particles. The shadow of a huge shark darted over nearby, making me wish I had bought a harpoon gun. Navigating the deep waters, I traced long zig-zagging paths as I searched for the sunken Butterscotch. I kept a close eye on my air gauge, making sure it didn't drop below a quarter.

After about twenty minutes, I found it. Her rusted hull rose from the sands, almost blending in as natural rock. The rip in her aft starboard must have landed face down, because I couldn't see any discernable damage. Swimming closer to the vessel, the water around me seemed to grow colder and colder. Debris began littering the sands underneath me, telling a story of chaos through fragmented hull pieces and buried shipping containers.

Swimming up to the lopsided deck, I froze in place when the sight of dead, badly decomposed bodies floated around the ship. Some hung from railings, others caught on wire running down from the central mast. An unsettling detail I observed was the fact some bodies were nothing more than chipping skeletons, while others were alarmingly fresh with soggy, pale skin.

Suddenly, the waters around me became significantly darker. Looking up, I noticed sunlight no longer breached the roaring waves. That couldn't be real, because the forecast said it was clear and I only had about an hour of oxygen in my tank. Panicked, I swam up and felt my heart just about stop when I realized what was going on. Thick fog had covered the ocean's surface.

Staying submerged, I searched for David's boat, hoping he'd do the smart thing and just leave me behind. With my oxygen more than halfway depleted, I weighed the options of drowning or surfacing to expose myself to the fog. Ultimately, I decided the smartest move would be to swim for the shore.

David's boat became visible, making my heart sink with dread. Swimming up to it, I tapped on the underbelly of the hull while staying submerged, hoping he would hear my attempt at communication. That's when a hand grabbed my leg.

If it wasn't for the scuba mask, I would have uttered the loudest scream of my life. David's lifeless, pale corpse was latched on to my leg, staring at me with those haunting black eyes. Recoiling my leg, I kicked David or whatever it was that looked like him squarely in the face, over and over again until it let go. Finally, the corpse lost its grip and sank into the depths, disappearing into inky darkness.

Leaving the boat behind, I continued to swim just underneath the surface on my dwindling oxygen supply. By some miracle, the fog hadn't quite touched down on the beach, allowing me to unceremoniously wash up on the shore like a beached whale. Ripping the mask off, I sprinted inland before the fog got any closer. When I got home, my father sat waiting for me in the kitchen with a scowl across his face.

<‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>

After changing into clean clothes, I sat down on the couch and waited for him to say something. I wasn't very thrilled that he showed up unannounced, but I didn't have the courage to tell him to leave, either. He was a scary man when he got angry, that much I could remember from when he beat my mom.

‚ÄúWhat did you do, JJ?‚Äù

His grumbling voice caught me off guard.

‚ÄúNothing, why?‚Äù

‚ÄúStop lying, son. There was no fog in the weather forecast, so why did it roll in? People all over town had to cancel their plans and scramble. What did you do to upset them?‚Äù

Staring with a blank expression, I considered making up a bold lie, but ultimately decided against it.

‚ÄúWell, I rented a boat and took a diving expedition to see the Butterscotch. The fog seemed to‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou WHAT?‚Äù

Bursting forward in his chair, my dad stomped forward and grabbed me by the collar. His face flushed red as spittle flew with every syllable:

‚ÄúBoy, I have HAD it with your dangerous investigations! You're just like your MOTHER!‚Äù

Letting me go, he ran over to the red landline phone, ripped it from the wall and threw it full force at my kitchen window. Cracks spiraled in the glass from the impact.

‚ÄúGet out, or I'm calling the cops!‚Äù

Glaring with fierce malice in his eyes, my father stood huffing for a few seconds before slamming the door hard enough to warp the wood trimming on his way out.

I sat in silence, processing what just happened. What did he mean I was like my mother? Did she try to investigate our town‚Äôs curse after Aria disappeared? Could she have discovered something? There was only one way to find out. Taking out my cell phone, I dialed up the sheriff's office.

‚ÄúYeah, I'd like to press charges on my dad for property damage. Can you send someone out here when the fog blows over?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, can you just provide us with an address, sir?‚Äù

As I rattled off my street number, I remembered that David's boat was still drifting out there. On the off chance I hallucinated the corpse grabbing me in the water, I told them to send someone out to look for my friend.

While waiting for them to arrive, I took pictures of the damage and filed a report with my landlord. Luckily, I still had the recording devices set up outside my door, which would be damning evidence against my dad considering it picked up his outburst.

<‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>

It didn't surprise me much when my dad refused my offer to look after the house when he got locked up. That didn't matter though, because I grew up in that house and knew how to sneak in through the garage window. All I needed to do was stack a few empty boxes along the side of the house and suck in my gut.

It shocked me how little the place changed. That old, ugly brown floral couch still faced the fireplace. He still had the same kitchen table with little lines and rivets etched into the wood from my sister and I cutting it with silverware. The only thing that changed was my bedroom, it was totally empty and stripped of carpet.

Stepping into my parent's old bedroom, I began rooting around in their dresser and closet, looking for anything my mom might have documented. I knew there was a good chance my dad erased anything she might have saved, but it was still worth a look. The only thing worthwhile was my mother's diary, which sat in a dusty corner of the closet.

Taking it to the kitchen table, I flipped through page after page of mundane writing. Things like my mom's opinion on politics or personal grievances she had with friends. Near the end, something about her writing changed. It must have been around the time Aria was exposed to the fog, because all she would write about was her worry for the child. It was the final entry that piqued my interest:

*My husband walked inside from the fog today. Nothing about him seems different, so how long has he been keeping that secret? I asked him what he was doing, but he just said he went out looking for Aria again. In a black suit and tie? With our town‚Äôs plague hanging in the air? I don't believe him. It bothers me that his father's death seems to be hitting him harder than losing Aria.*

It dawned on me that my dad had mentioned my grandfather before, when he was drunk the night I asked him to keep me company. Closing the diary, I knew my next objective would be to learn more about my grandfather‚Ä¶ a man my dad never spoke about growing up. I suspected my dad wouldn't be eager to volunteer any information, especially after I got him locked up, so I'd have to do my investigation elsewhere.

<‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>

Pouring through pages of mortuary records and phone book listings, I searched for people with my last name. I could only hope my grandfather didn't decide to change up the family surname when my dad was born. I wrote down a small list of possible names and prepared to head back home.

‚ÄúAh, sorry JJ, the fog rolled in while you were reading. A few of our guests are making themselves comfortable in the library's meeting room if you want to crash there for now.‚Äù

Glancing through the rotating glass doors, I confirmed she was telling the truth. Taking in a deep breath, I smiled and gestured to the back of the library.

‚ÄúI'll probably just hang out back there, if that's okay?‚Äù

She returned my smile and nodded. Truthfully, I just didn't want to be near other people in case any voices or apparitions tried to torment me. Taking a few books to a lounge chair in a cozy corner of the library, I sighed and tried to relax. My effort paid off, since I nodded off to sleep halfway through reading a book.

I awoke to a hand shaking my shoulder. Before I could fully wake up, I immediately noticed the air felt extremely cold. Locking eyes with a strange man in uniform, I realized I was no longer in the library.

‚ÄúWake up, we have to get topside and board the lifeboats!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat's going on?‚Äù

My voice didn't sound like it normally did. Looking around, I seemed to be inside a large metallic chamber, like the cargo hold of a ship. A loud alarm screeched in the background.

‚ÄúJust follow me, we've gotta get the hell outta here!‚Äù

The man turned and sprinted down the chamber. Before I could get up to follow, a thunderous crash of water exploded from several hallways further up the chamber. The man who shook me awake was engulfed in seconds, swept up with large cargo containers and other large pieces of equipment. Raising my hands to protect my face, I screamed and waited for the water to crash into me and end my life, but it never came.

‚ÄúJJ, what's wrong with you, are you okay?‚Äù

Lowering my hands, I saw the young receptionist staring at me with a hand over her mouth. I was back in the library‚Ä¶ warm, dry and safe. Glancing out of a nearby window, I saw the fog was starting to evaporate.

‚ÄúUgh, yeah, I'm fine. Just had a nightmare, that's all.‚Äù

<‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>

Sitting down at my kitchen table, I began researching all the names I scribbled down on my phone. It didn't take too long to confirm my grandfather's identity through old public records, but finding any real information on the man was very difficult. All I could dig up was his gravesite, an old career record with the navy before my dad was born and a few living relatives.

Grandpa Harold had one living sister who lived way across the country. Looking her up in the phone book, I dialed her up and hoped for the best.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

‚ÄúHi, is this Elizabeth?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes? Who's this?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm JJ, your brother's grandson. Would it be okay if I asked you a few questions about Harold?‚Äù

She went silent for a moment, breaking into a fit of soft laughter before continuing to speak in her raspy old voice:

‚ÄúOh my, I didn't think Harold had a grandson! That man just didn't share anything with the world, you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, yeah, my father is the same way. Apple doesn't fall far, I suppose. Well, anyway, do you know much about Harold‚Äôs life? Like, where he worked or anything like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, sure, I'll tell you a bit about my brother. Served the navy for a few years then got a job operating a lighthouse in a little town. That must have been a hard job on poor Harold, he never spoke to the family much.‚Äù

She continued to rattle off about her brother's early school years and fond memories of seeing him during the holidays, but I zoned out after hearing the bombshell she dropped. My grandfather was the lighthouse operator, therefore he was responsible for the Butterscotch's demise.

‚ÄúThank you for your time, Elizabeth. I have to go, but I'll keep in touch with you. I've been meaning to reconnect with extended family.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, JJ, it was nice talking with you. I'll take your call anytime, dear. Life in this retirement home couldn't be any more boring, after all!‚Äù

She gave another soft laugh and we said our goodbyes.

<‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>

Paying my father a visit in jail, I picked up the phone and glared at him through the glass separating us.

‚ÄúWhat do you want, JJ? Haven't you fucked me over enough?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know about grandpa, dad. He was the lighthouse operator.‚Äù

Leaning back in his seat, he dusted something off the orange leg of his jumpsuit and shrugged.

‚ÄúOkay, took you long enough to figure that one out. Why tell me about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know why this town is cursed, dad, and you seem to know how to get around that curse. Don't you want to share that secret with the world? Stop people from dying and losing their minds?‚Äù

He smiled and set the phone down for a moment. Eying the clock, I estimated we had about a minute left on our visit.

‚ÄúIt's not that easy, JJ. Believe me, I'd have done so already if it was.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't understand, dad. Why can't you give me any answers? If the world can't know, why not your son?‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, you remember how the note you found said faith protects the mind?‚Äù

Narrowing my eyes, I responded with a slow nod.

‚ÄúNext time you see them or find yourself in a dark place, just pray to the lord for light to guide them. There is no cure or solution to walk through the fog unphased, JJ. If I tried to explain why I can, you simply wouldn't understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúTry me, dad.‚Äù

Two officers walked up behind him and said something I couldn't hear.

‚ÄúWe're out of time, anyways. I'll make things right when I get out of here, okay? Just stay safe for now, JJ.‚Äù

<‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>

David's funeral passed by with solemn words and sobering moments of grief from his loved ones. I couldn't help but feel like a third wheel in a way, since my invitation was mostly due to our final moments together at sea. Angry glares from his parents and siblings didn't help a bit, so I paid my respects and went on my way.

Since I was at the graveyard, I decided to pay grandpa Harold‚Äôs tombstone a visit. It was caked in dirt and overgrowth, so out of respect I took a moment to clean it up the best I could. There was a picture hidden in the tangle of weeds.

It was a black and white photograph, depicting a younger version of my dad and who I assumed to be grandpa Harold. They stood in front of the lighthouse, dressed in nice black suits with a Bible in their hands. I noticed the property around the lighthouse seemed much more tidy and well kept in the photo.

‚ÄúSomeone should clean up that place, it's a shame to see it in such a pitiful state.‚Äù

Pastor Mark surprised me when he spoke, catching me off guard as I turned to see him looking over my shoulder.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing out here?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust paying respects to David with a final prayer, that's all really. Couldn't help but notice you were taking care of your grandpa's grave.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou knew Harold?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot particularly. I was closer to your dad when we were kids, Harold was more like a grumpy adult the neighborhood kids didn't like. He'd always get snappy when we‚Äôd get mischievous and snoop around the lighthouse property.‚Äù

Looking down at the photo, something dawned on me. Pastor Mark couldn't be more than my dad's age, which meant the lighthouse was fully automated around the time he'd be a kid wandering around the neighborhood.

‚ÄúWait a minute, why did Harold keep working at the lighthouse if it was automated in the late 60‚Äôs? Weren't you and my dad born in like, the early 70‚Äôs?‚Äù

Mark's brow twitched up and he flashed a coy little smile.

‚ÄúWell, Harold had a sense of responsibility and ownership for that place. The old man didn't want to give up looking after the property, even after they sacked his job. He'd cut the grass, trim the weeds and just make sure the place looked nice and tidy.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm, grandpa sure seemed like a hard working man, I'll give him that.‚Äù

Mark took a few steps closer and put a hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúJJ, not many people believe me when I say this, but you've got a good head on your shoulders, so let me fill you in on a little secret. When Harold got too old to upkeep the lighthouse, I noticed we started getting a lot more foggy weather throughout the year. Call me crazy, but I think whatever is out there cursing the fog is angry that the lighthouse has fallen into a state of disrepair.‚Äù

Staring down at our feet, I considered the pastor's words and nodded in agreement.

‚ÄúWell, next weekend I'll bring some gardening tools and fix up the yard. Who knows, maybe it'll help.‚Äù",2,1758570905.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

It was my first time and my bf‚Äôs first time as well and we absolutely loved it!

9/17
- landed at MSY
- Uber to hotel (Maison Metier, one of the best hotels I‚Äôve personally ever stayed in) 
- dinner at Herbsaint (those fried green tomatoes!!) 
- drinks at Salon Salon (little speakeasy bar in the hotel) 

9/18
- took the streetcar to City Park 
- beignets and coffee at Cafe du Monde (their frozen cafe au lait was a surprising hit) 
- NOMA and the Sculpture Garden (definitely make time for the sculpture garden if you can, it was so cool to check out!) 
- lunch at NOMA Cafe (sandwiches are bigger than you‚Äôd expect) 
- New Orleans Botanical Garden (they have the sweetest cat who we met) 
- drinks at Jolie and Junebug (Jolie had live music which was cool but Junebug had better drinks) 
- dinner at Peche (crab claws and whole fish were my faves! My bf who prefers not looking a fish in it‚Äôs face while eating it‚Ä¶ not so much) 

9/19
- breakfast at Bearcat CBD (their pork chop plate is no joke, we couldn‚Äôt finish the whole thing!) 
- tour of the Garden District (shoutout to 2 Chicks Walking Tour)

9/20
- Uber to Jackson Square
- walked through artist alley and around the French Quarter in general (see if you can stop by and talk to Elaine, she had some great stories)

1nnwo6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1nnwo6g/breville_bambino_is_no_longer_extracting/,Breville Bambino is no longer extracting.,"I purchased my Breville Bambino a little over 3 years ago. 

As time has gone on, I've had blockage issues more and more frequently: I press the button to start extraction, 12+ seconds go by, and no coffee comes out. 

When I pull the portafilter off, it makes a huge mess as all the pressure is relieved into my hand, splashing coffee and water everywhere. 

This was usually a rare event. In more recent months it's been like 1 in every 10-15 extractions, and now the machine is no longer extracting. 

Here is a summary of the situation:

* I have just finished a descaling cycle. The cycle was successful but I now can no longer extract coffee at all. 

* I am using a double-walled basket. My grinder is cheap and cannot grind any finer than what I have.

* I have tried tamping softer, underfilling the basket, and ""channeling"" with a plastic fork. No luck.

Have I knackered my machine somehow? I would appreciate any help.

**EDIT:** I managed to get an extraction through! I had to run the portfilter ""dry"" 4-5 times after soaking it. Maybe there was just too much gunk in it. I've wasted quite enough coffee today trying to fix my problem; I will see if this fixes the problem in the near term.",2,1758570732.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

He recently escalated to asking me if I want a platonic relationship and outside partners. I got really upset.

The main problem is I am exhausted. We both work fulltime. But, I wake up with son 7/7 mornings, put son to bed 7/7 nights. I get him to nap on weekends 100% of the time. I do all baths (except 2 in the past 6 months), majority of outings, 7/7 dinners, 7/7 breakfasts and 2/7 lunches (rest is on nanny while I am at work). I am the only one cooking for our son with multiple allergies, I do doctor visits and keep track of all his meds and supplements (which are a lot) and am in charge of food reintroductions. I also wash dishes and clean after dinner. My partner sometimes babysits evenings and takes son out to park. He does all the yard work, he sometimes washes stuff. We outsource food. Cleaning is mostly on me lately, except his office.

But I am too exhausted to have sex and maybe it would have been more manageable if it took like 15-20 minutes, but he lasts a lot.

I asked him for support, to take 2 bedtime routines per week and 1 park outing and clean after dinner when I put son to bed. He said I was clever, dumping more responsibility on him. Then he announced me he is taking a full week off next week and won't be at home.

Am I being whiny or does my partner need to step up more and be at least a 30-70 parent? I am aware his SIBO gives him fatigue, but I literally can't do more than this. Even as I write this, I drank coffee late so I can stay awake and have a conversation. He dismissed me and walked out the room, said he was tired.

Be kind, I am exhausted, scared and frustrated it got so far. I really want a loving home for our son, but we're far from offering one and I am heartbroken for him, I feel I failed him as a mother.

Edited to add: I said babysitting because to me that means spending time with a child without actual care (feeding, bath, changing etc.) And didn't know how to express it otherwise. So basically, spending quality time with son.",0,1758570696.0,Marriage,13,0.5,False

1nnwmuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/1nnwmuk/my_2025_fall_body_mist_shopping_guide_for_the/,"My 2025 Fall body mist shopping guide for the late, overwhelmed shopper","It‚Äôs late September and the summer heat is finally dying down. People are ready to start wearing fall body mists, but BBW is already clearancing them out because of their early sales cycle. The sales are ramping up while stock is dwindling or already gone. 

But some have just started shopping. If you‚Äôd like a guide for the overwhelming, disappearing amount of scents still available, I made this for you! 

I have smelled and tested all at least once. There‚Äôs 27 mists here and I own about 9 of them. Plus have had 2 in other forms (Champagne Apple and Honey, Sunrise Woods hand soaps). 

##Beverages 

Liquor 
* Forever Red - bit of pomegranate bubblegum, realistic vanilla rum dry down 
* Pink Obsessed - this year‚Äôs version has less florals to my nose. So mostly vanilla bourbon in the dry down. 
* Inner Angel - not as cognac heavy as its inspiration Killian Angel Share. Still a bit, with fall spices and warm apple cider. Unisex, a slightly sweeter version inspired by a unisex men‚Äôs cologne. 

Coffee 
* Vanilla Cafe - hazelnut coffee creamer latte opening. More or a caramel coffee musk dry down? Like a lighter Glazed Pumpkin 
* Rich Espresso - hazelnut flavor espresso coffee grounds. I heard it layers with Vanilla Cafe well. 

Soda 
* I Scream Float - smells like Coca Cola gummies, hints of cinnamon spices such as in Mexican Coca Cola or hot chocolate 

##Sweet treats 

* Glazed Pumpkin - ‚Äúdry donut‚Äù (Bonnie‚Äôs description), deepest brown sugar glaze. Very strong‚Äîfirst loved, then hated. Perhaps the strength is polarizing? 
* Whipped Honey and Vanilla - honey bun frosting to deep caramel, glazed honey musk (not that far from Glazed Pumpkin imo). 
* Milk Bar Celebration Cake - bare, dry cake, waxy birthday cake candle. Could be a batch issue as others say they get buttery cake, buttercream frosting, which I didn‚Äôt. Less sweet than Whipped Honey and Vanilla to me. 
* Delicate Iris (Scent Lab mini) - has a caramel note that starts off light and vastly deepens into something like Glazed Pumpkin caramel musk. Not my favorite, but it you missed Glazed Pumpkin you can try smelling the very last dry down notes of this one. 
* Evil Queen - (see below) - some say they can or can‚Äôt smell a caramel apple note, but I can. It‚Äôs a milky, light caramel which I prefer to deeper, muskier caramels (above). 

##Warm, woodsy

Smoky 
* Vanilla Romance - reminds me of natural soda (sugar cane, hint of vanilla extract), bit of smoky cardamom, like a cold smoke. Much less smoky than last year. 
* Wicked Vanilla Woods - camphor, smoky vanilla. Like a toned down version of last year‚Äôs ultra smoky Vanilla Romance. 
* Maleficent - (see below) 

Creamy 
* Sunrise Woods - creamy musk, hint of berries, tiniest amount of woods
* Milk - milk froth, sandalwood, tiniest whiff of milk sour 
* Amber Suede - (see below) - has a vanilla cream note

Amber
* In the Stars - slightly dead smelling like an apple beginning to brown. It‚Äôs a warm amber with a browned, dead allure
* Amber Suede (Scent Lab mini) - begins amber but blooms into a whipped vanilla cream fragrance, for a sparkling vanilla cream soda effect. 

Cozy, clean:
* Book Loft - could think of this as an amber fragrance because of its neroli. But it also has a distinctive bergamot for a fuzzy, just out the dryer, warm laundry scent. 
* Golden Cherry - similar bergamot as Book Loft, mixed in with an unsweetened hibiscus, could be underripe cherry note. 
* Sweater Weather - this has whispers of apple shampoo, cologne-y aftershave, cool air, gray skies, wool coat, and dead leaves. Leans masculine, but wearable if you enjoy some of BBW‚Äôs masculine marketed fragrances. 

##Botanical 

* Free as a Flower - a deep, warm botanical with strong orange blossom/neroli (the depth of In the Stars, Book Loft). As it dries down it becomes both airier and soapier. Not really lavender. 
* Vanilla Ease - herbal lavender opening to a natural soda (to me, like a ginger sage kombucha) type scent with a little hint of vanilla extract sweetness. 

##Fruity 

Girly fruity:  
* Champagne Apple and Honey - sparkly, girly, red apple version of Champagne Toast. Easily a spring scent, even though red apples have fall connotations. 
* Ghoul Friend - imagine Sweet Pea with two massive handfuls of Welch‚Äôs natural strawberry fruit snacks. Gummy scented. Hints of vitamin powder. Not my favorite. 

Unisex fruity:
* Golden Cherry - (see above) not sweet, not like any other BBW cherry. Smells more like unsweetened hibiscus tea to me. But you can try it. 

Spooky fruity 
* Evil Queen - Begins like Princess Tiana with a gilded pear note. Moves into something like In the Stars but not as overripe fruit smelling. Stays fresher, greener, pink lady apple. Then moves into a milky caramel apple type of scent where it remains. Could go into the dessert category instead, except for its spooky, mossy notes. 
* Vampire Blood - mixed berry popsicle taken in a dark pomegranate direction. Scared of this one since I saw reviews saying the red liquid of the mist and hand sanitizer stains clothing. 

##Deep and dark 

Dark rose:
* Maleficent - smokier Into the Night with dark rose, smoky oud and overripe plum. A polarizing, noxious bomb. 
* Into the Night - raspberry noir, sugar crystals, dark rose. 

Other dark: 
* Midnight Addiction - similar mood as Into the Night without rose. Haven‚Äôt tested this much, but says it has coffee and plum notes.

I (F20) was prescribed 150XL of bupropion on September 12th and started taking it on the 15th. I‚Äôm already on 40mg Prozac but my doctor added it to hopefully help with libido. Around day 3 I started getting really bad hand tremors (especially after coffee) that would lead to numb arms, worse fine motor skills and overall twitchiness. My feet and legs would go tingly too. I stopped taking the pills at the same time as my coffee and that sort of helped but as an already anxious person this side effect really bothered me. The other bad side effect (?) is the excessive crying, but I‚Äôll get to that. 

What made all this worse is in the days between me getting the prescription and starting to take the pills I went through a really terrible humiliating situationship breakup(I‚Äôm already hardly ever attracted to anyone, and he was the whole reason I wanted to improve my libido, but now it‚Äôs completely over and I feel like my brain is going through drug withdrawals from this person). Now for the past couple days I cannot stop crying. It was fine at first but now I struggle to make it through a single class or bus ride without needing to push back tears. Every time I‚Äôm alone I start crying. Is this a medication side effect or am I genuinely just this sad? Because I feel incredibly depressed, something I don‚Äôt usually deal with (I‚Äôm on Prozac for anxiety). Everything is dull and I just don‚Äôt feel like myself at all. 

So today I had a call with my doctor to tell her I wanted to stop taking the pills and hopefully go back to my emotional baseline. My birthday is in a week and I really want to have an at least semi enjoyable time.

All that to say, here are my questions;
- If you stopped taking bupropion after about a week, how long did it take for the side effects to go away? My doctor said up to 2 weeks but i genuinely don‚Äôt know if I can handle that)
- Does anyone else have the excessive crying side effect or is that not a side effect at all?
- Do you think that if I were to stick it out and stay on the pills for a bit longer I would notice benefits or did I make the right decision to stop. (Feel free to not answer this I know there is no real answer I‚Äôm just speaking to the void here)
- if anyone else has dealt with a really terrible romantic situation please drop some guidance cause this is literal torture and I feel like I can never trust anyone ever again",1,1758570481.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

If you‚Äôre reading this, just know you aren‚Äôt alone. You will get through this, you will heal, and you will be okay. 

Wanted to jump in here and share my experience with Misoprostol as it did not align with most stories I read online.

I had slow rising betas from the start and knew this one wouldn‚Äôt stick. I started to experience coffee ground like discharge, brown and spotty. I scheduled an ultrasound to be checked, but the morning of I had some very intense cramping. Immediately jumped into bed with my heating pad and yelled into a pillow with each cramp/contraction. They lasted maybe 45 minutes start to finish. I then went to my ultrasound appointment and 7w from my LMP, the gestational sac and fetal pole measured 6w1d.

Not only this, but the sac had moved from my uterus to my cervix (it was in my uterus measuring small the week before). I decided to take 800mcg of misoprostol vaginally that afternoon at 3:30. I read SO many horror stories and had myself worked up a bit. Took 800mg Motrin every 6-8 hours and stayed close to my heating pad. 

Woke up at 11pm somewhat crampy thinking it was just beginning, only to fall back asleep. I started to spot red the next morning, but very little. 24 hours from my first dose my OB advised I do the second dose of 800mcg, so I did. 

Inserted the second dose, laid for 30 minutes on my side waiting for the worst, but it never happened. I continued lightly spotting red and on the third day in the morning, I passed one clot maybe the size of a silver dollar. 

I was sure it wasn‚Äôt working. Where was all the blood? The cramping? I‚Äôd convinced myself I would need a D&C at this point.

6 days from the second dose I had a follow up ultrasound and sure enough, I had passed the sac. I‚Äôm still so surprised by the lack of side effects I encountered. I know this is NOT everyone‚Äôs experience, but I wanted to share mine in case somebody else found themselves in the same boat.

1nnwi4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nnwi4p/the_mariner/,The Mariner,"September 17, 20--

To whomever is reading:¬†

Please pardon my recollections and remembrances, as the events that have occurred in the past 24 hours have been the oddest, most appalling, and most confusing that I, and perhaps any other man, have experienced.¬†

The consistent knocking and banging on the other side of the steel door only adds to my frustration.

My name is Robert Leng, and I am‚Äîor *was*, knowing my likely fate‚Äîa deep-sea marine biologist studying the phenomena, fauna, and any other peculiarity that lies at the bottom of the sea floor. To be more specific, I worked and conducted my research in a small, obtuse research facility located deep beneath in the Mid-Atlantic, alongside a dozen other colleagues.

My troubles began when our research leader, Dr. Cousar, assigned me and two other researchers‚Äîodd, I thought, as our ROVs usually require only one person‚Äîto conduct a routine mission collecting samples from the seafloor. I vehemently accepted, as I take great pleasure in piloting our ROVs for specimen collection. As luck would have it, however, it was going through repairs, so I would have to man our heavily modified Pisces-class sub with my crewmates to conduct the mission.

Our descent was the only seemingly normal part of this story, our crew experiencing no difficulties during this period. It was when we actually reached the sea floor that things became abnormal. During our last expedition, where thriving deep-sea ecosystems once existed just days before, now in front of us, the multitude and monotony of dead coral, the hollowed-out shells of crustations, and an unmoving seafloor. ‚ÄúWhat should we make of this?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat could possibly explain this?‚Äù were common phrases said by all three of us at this moment.¬†

During further investigation, the decayed surface still unchanged, I saw the bright bronze glow of some object in our sub‚Äôs lights. ‚ÄúAh! perhaps this sea floor isn‚Äôt as dead as we once thought, and that some semblance of life could be found in a once-mysical, dark paradise of aquatic civilization!‚Äù I thought to myself.¬†

I steered our vessel‚Äîslowly, but ever closer‚Äîto the odd object that, out of the lifeless and deceased ocean floor it inhabited, had the light of life yet still in it. Using the mechanical arms of the sub, I carefully and thoughtfully brought the object out of its solitude, the glowing bronze hugh further exhibiting this thing‚Äôs beauty. When removed fully from its sandy confines, we realized, with great confusion and curiosity, that beheld in the arms of our submarine was the diving helmet of an old deep-sea diver, presumably, from my research, from the 19th century.

We had stumbled and excavated a marvelous artifact‚Äîa treasure!

But my‚Äîand perhaps their thoughts‚Äîwere also one of questioning, of who this article of marine apparel belonged to. What surprised us, too, was how new and shiny it looked, as if it were just recently plunged into the ocean‚Äôs depths. We had no time to think of it, however, so our objective was to secure the specimen, go back to our facility, study it, and report it to Dr. Cousar.¬†

We arrived back at our post shortly, unloading both ourselves and our mysterious cargo. Dr. Cousar, in particular, was very interested in not just our reports of a dead ocean floor but also in the diving helmet itself. Thus, as a researcher of all things relating to and found on the ocean floor, the Dr. instructed me to study and examine the antique, while the rest of the crew surveys and hypothesizes the reasons for the degradation of the sea-bottom.¬†

I thus hurried to the lab, where I would be deep in seclusion, to parse over our find. The helmet was very large, certainly to support any man who dared enter its unnerving character. Yet, it was still so very beautiful, its form still harboring the curiosity of the man who wore it must‚Äôve had, and its legacy being one of melancholy, as its master was likely himself at the bottom of the sea's darkest depths, slowly eaten by the unknown creatures that inhabit an unknown part of an already-explored world. Indeed, even under the scrutiny of a microscope, very few, if any, blemishes were present on the artifact‚Äîa fact that shocked me. What I did see, however, was text near the base that said, in simple terms, ‚Äú*Siebe Gorman & Co. 1889*.‚Äù I had stumbled upon such a gem! A piece of lost history now found by a layman, in the scheme of things!¬†¬†

Then, a series of noises sounded through the corridors of the facility. *Bang, bang, bang, bang*, the sound of a continuous banging was ever-present. I briefly left the lab after putting the helmet in a safe, sanitary container, where I would go to confirm with my coworkers that I was not just hearing things. They said they had not heard such a sound, and that either something natural was clinging to the haul, or that I was deprived of rest due to my non-stop study. Both possibilities unnerved me, as the former was unlikely to occur during our research, and the latter meant that perhaps I was going a little mad. But is there nothing that a little rest couldn‚Äôt fix?

Rest, then, was my chief objective, exhaustion holding me within its dense grasp. But alas! when I tried to sleep, the mysterious banging echoed throughout the hall and, having no one else to relate to me during this troublesome experience, I was left in total loneliness, in an isolation that very few of our species could comprehend. I tossed and turned, I remember, covering my ears with my pillow, curled into the fetal position (oh, to be a child again, in total ignorance!). At some point, though, as if Providence had allowed me to fall into idleness, I fell asleep into obscurity and peace.¬†

I woke up in a haze, unaware of the horrors that must‚Äôve transpired during my slumber. Peaking my head out from my door, I saw that utter chaos enveloped our small, inconsequential station. Flickering lights and broken-down doors littered the hallway as I slowly walked down, stepping with caution and uncertainty. A primal fear inhibiting my senses, I entered into the lounge area, where the cushions of couches were destroyed, brown coffee on the table spilled, the latter apparently mixed with the red blood of my coworkers. I had not seen any bodies, however, so perhaps those colleagues of mine had bested whatever beast was the origin of this devastation.¬†

A fire axe was clung to the wall in an adjacent hall, still kept in its glass capsule. Not knowing what threat I may face, I seized the axe from its confines, my hands clenching the long wooden handle in anxious desperation. All the while, the faint banging of the night‚Äôs previous loud cry reverberated throughout the halls, as if to mock me and my pitiful situation. *Bang, bang, bang, bang*. Is this my purgatory? A hell undeserved?¬†

Suddenly, a noise was heard in an adjacent hallway, not the thump heard reverberating through the station, but more like footsteps‚Äîloud, hulking footsteps. Could this possibly be one of my missing colleagues? A vanished friend? A sense of desperation, doubt and anticipation filled my heart, as it was beating out of my chest, similar to the cryptic drumming resonance echoing through the facility. There was only one way to find out‚Äîto venture into the abyss.

As I progressed down the narrow corridors, the wretched smell of seaweed‚Äìironically, a noxious odour I have always abhorred!‚Äîfilled my nostrils, as those soft, yet heavy footsteps could be heard in the near distance. An oddity I noticed was the footprints, a dense, wet trail of saltwater leading towards that dreaded chamber; could this yet be hope of rescue?¬†

Stepping into the metal archway of that loathsome hallway, the one that the trail inevitably led to, I looked down the gray hallway, as in the dim, fluttering light, I saw a silhouette of someone‚Äîor something. I was stunned immediately, frozen in fear at the creature stalking me from just mere meters away. Standing in the hallway, an apex predator staring and taunting its inevitable prey, was a large, bulky man‚Äîso I thought‚Äîstagnant and unmoving, the stench of seaweed ever more present, and horrendous. I dared not move, but this creature took two mere steps before it was many feet nearer to me. But it was this time‚Äîthis dreaded time!‚Äîthat I was able to see the beast to the best of my ability, as it stood in a fluorescent light. I am moved not to tell of its figure, but for the sake of a warning and evidence for my horrors experienced, this cadaver was the most foul, ghastly thing that I have ever encountered.¬†

But oh! I beheld the tanned suit that it was wearing, fixtures of patches, belts, and antique equipment stuck headfirst on a torso so soaked in saltwater and ocean chaf, with the addition of trailing tubes for breathing. But what was I looking at? I knew in my heart what I was witnessing, but I dared not entertain that idea in the moment. It was its face, however, that was the most frightening of all, bequeathed with sores, scars, leading eyes, a concave cranium‚Äîa melting, gangrenous, gelatinous horror. If this thing were a man in a previous life, then he is a man no more. Indeed, this beast made an Ancient Egyptian mummy look like a gentleman in the midst of the decadence of Sodom and Gomorrah!¬†

Clutching the axe with maximum force, I hurried myself into a defensive stance, ready to combat the creature from Lucifer‚Äôs lair. It inched closer to me, closing the gap between the moral and immoral, its awkward, gawky strut further accentuating its supernatural composition. Just as it was mere feet away, I held up the axe to strike in self-defense, just as Thor would plummet his hammer upon those mythological giants of old. But before I could make contact with the edge of my weapon, a large, slimy tentacle‚Äîlike that of the great Kraken!‚Äîprotruded from the side abdomen of the monster, clutching to the head of my axe. A great struggle ensued, a grappling of a tool between that which was alive and that which was undead. Unfortunately for me, my opponent was able to seize the axe due to its enormous strength, almost taking me with it into its abysmal vacuum of a perverted body.¬†

The beast, beholding my only physical line of defense, snapped it in two, as primitive man would‚Äôve done to the weakly-branched weapon of his adversary.

To whomever is reading:¬†

Please pardon my recollections and remembrances, as the events that have occurred in the past 24 hours have been the oddest, most appalling, and most confusing that I, and perhaps any other man, have experienced.¬†

The consistent knocking and banging on the other side of the steel door only adds to my frustration.

My name is Robert Leng, and I am‚Äîor *was*, knowing my likely fate‚Äîa deep-sea marine biologist studying the phenomena, fauna, and any other peculiarity that lies at the bottom of the sea floor. To be more specific, I worked and conducted my research in a small, obtuse research facility located deep beneath in the Mid-Atlantic, alongside a dozen other colleagues.

My troubles began when our research leader, Dr. Cousar, assigned me and two other researchers‚Äîodd, I thought, as our ROVs usually require only one person‚Äîto conduct a routine mission collecting samples from the seafloor. I vehemently accepted, as I take great pleasure in piloting our ROVs for specimen collection. As luck would have it, however, it was going through repairs, so I would have to man our heavily modified Pisces-class sub with my crewmates to conduct the mission.

Our descent was the only seemingly normal part of this story, our crew experiencing no difficulties during this period. It was when we actually reached the sea floor that things became abnormal. During our last expedition, where thriving deep-sea ecosystems once existed just days before, now in front of us, the multitude and monotony of dead coral, the hollowed-out shells of crustations, and an unmoving seafloor. ‚ÄúWhat should we make of this?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat could possibly explain this?‚Äù were common phrases said by all three of us at this moment.¬†

During further investigation, the decayed surface still unchanged, I saw the bright bronze glow of some object in our sub‚Äôs lights. ‚ÄúAh! perhaps this sea floor isn‚Äôt as dead as we once thought, and that some semblance of life could be found in a once-mysical, dark paradise of aquatic civilization!‚Äù I thought to myself.¬†

I steered our vessel‚Äîslowly, but ever closer‚Äîto the odd object that, out of the lifeless and deceased ocean floor it inhabited, had the light of life yet still in it. Using the mechanical arms of the sub, I carefully and thoughtfully brought the object out of its solitude, the glowing bronze hugh further exhibiting this thing‚Äôs beauty. When removed fully from its sandy confines, we realized, with great confusion and curiosity, that beheld in the arms of our submarine was the diving helmet of an old deep-sea diver, presumably, from my research, from the 19th century.

We had stumbled and excavated a marvelous artifact‚Äîa treasure!

But my‚Äîand perhaps their thoughts‚Äîwere also one of questioning, of who this article of marine apparel belonged to. What surprised us, too, was how new and shiny it looked, as if it were just recently plunged into the ocean‚Äôs depths. We had no time to think of it, however, so our objective was to secure the specimen, go back to our facility, study it, and report it to Dr. Cousar.¬†

We arrived back at our post shortly, unloading both ourselves and our mysterious cargo. Dr. Cousar, in particular, was very interested in not just our reports of a dead ocean floor but also in the diving helmet itself. Thus, as a researcher of all things relating to and found on the ocean floor, the Dr. instructed me to study and examine the antique, while the rest of the crew surveys and hypothesizes the reasons for the degradation of the sea-bottom.¬†

I thus hurried to the lab, where I would be deep in seclusion, to parse over our find. The helmet was very large, certainly to support any man who dared enter its unnerving character. Yet, it was still so very beautiful, its form still harboring the curiosity of the man who wore it must‚Äôve had, and its legacy being one of melancholy, as its master was likely himself at the bottom of the sea's darkest depths, slowly eaten by the unknown creatures that inhabit an unknown part of an already-explored world. Indeed, even under the scrutiny of a microscope, very few, if any, blemishes were present on the artifact‚Äîa fact that shocked me. What I did see, however, was text near the base that said, in simple terms, ‚Äú*Siebe Gorman & Co. 1889*.‚Äù I had stumbled upon such a gem! A piece of lost history now found by a layman, in the scheme of things!¬†¬†

Then, a series of noises sounded through the corridors of the facility. *Bang, bang, bang, bang*, the sound of a continuous banging was ever-present. I briefly left the lab after putting the helmet in a safe, sanitary container, where I would go to confirm with my coworkers that I was not just hearing things. They said they had not heard such a sound, and that either something natural was clinging to the haul, or that I was deprived of rest due to my non-stop study. Both possibilities unnerved me, as the former was unlikely to occur during our research, and the latter meant that perhaps I was going a little mad. But is there nothing that a little rest couldn‚Äôt fix?

Rest, then, was my chief objective, exhaustion holding me within its dense grasp. But alas! when I tried to sleep, the mysterious banging echoed throughout the hall and, having no one else to relate to me during this troublesome experience, I was left in total loneliness, in an isolation that very few of our species could comprehend. I tossed and turned, I remember, covering my ears with my pillow, curled into the fetal position (oh, to be a child again, in total ignorance!). At some point, though, as if Providence had allowed me to fall into idleness, I fell asleep into obscurity and peace.¬†

I woke up in a haze, unaware of the horrors that must‚Äôve transpired during my slumber. Peaking my head out from my door, I saw that utter chaos enveloped our small, inconsequential station. Flickering lights and broken-down doors littered the hallway as I slowly walked down, stepping with caution and uncertainty. A primal fear inhibiting my senses, I entered into the lounge area, where the cushions of couches were destroyed, brown coffee on the table spilled, the latter apparently mixed with the red blood of my coworkers. I had not seen any bodies, however, so perhaps those colleagues of mine had bested whatever beast was the origin of this devastation.¬†

A fire axe was clung to the wall in an adjacent hall, still kept in its glass capsule. Not knowing what threat I may face, I seized the axe from its confines, my hands clenching the long wooden handle in anxious desperation. All the while, the faint banging of the night‚Äôs previous loud cry reverberated throughout the halls, as if to mock me and my pitiful situation. *Bang, bang, bang, bang*. Is this my purgatory? A hell undeserved?¬†

Suddenly, a noise was heard in an adjacent hallway, not the thump heard reverberating through the station, but more like footsteps‚Äîloud, hulking footsteps. Could this possibly be one of my missing colleagues? A vanished friend? A sense of desperation, doubt and anticipation filled my heart, as it was beating out of my chest, similar to the cryptic drumming resonance echoing through the facility. There was only one way to find out‚Äîto venture into the abyss.

As I progressed down the narrow corridors, the wretched smell of seaweed‚Äìironically, a noxious odour I have always abhorred!‚Äîfilled my nostrils, as those soft, yet heavy footsteps could be heard in the near distance. An oddity I noticed was the footprints, a dense, wet trail of saltwater leading towards that dreaded chamber; could this yet be hope of rescue?¬†

Stepping into the metal archway of that loathsome hallway, the one that the trail inevitably led to, I looked down the gray hallway, as in the dim, fluttering light, I saw a silhouette of someone‚Äîor something. I was stunned immediately, frozen in fear at the creature stalking me from just mere meters away. Standing in the hallway, an apex predator staring and taunting its inevitable prey, was a large, bulky man‚Äîso I thought‚Äîstagnant and unmoving, the stench of seaweed ever more present, and horrendous. I dared not move, but this creature took two mere steps before it was many feet nearer to me. But it was this time‚Äîthis dreaded time!‚Äîthat I was able to see the beast to the best of my ability, as it stood in a fluorescent light. I am moved not to tell of its figure, but for the sake of a warning and evidence for my horrors experienced, this cadaver was the most foul, ghastly thing that I have ever encountered.¬†

But oh! I beheld the tanned suit that it was wearing, fixtures of patches, belts, and antique equipment stuck headfirst on a torso so soaked in saltwater and ocean chaf, with the addition of trailing tubes for breathing. But what was I looking at? I knew in my heart what I was witnessing, but I dared not entertain that idea in the moment. It was its face, however, that was the most frightening of all, bequeathed with sores, scars, leading eyes, a concave cranium‚Äîa melting, gangrenous, gelatinous horror. If this thing were a man in a previous life, then he is a man no more. Indeed, this beast made an Ancient Egyptian mummy look like a gentleman in the midst of the decadence of Sodom and Gomorrah!¬†

Clutching the axe with maximum force, I hurried myself into a defensive stance, ready to combat the creature from Lucifer‚Äôs lair. It inched closer to me, closing the gap between the moral and immoral, its awkward, gawky strut further accentuating its supernatural composition. Just as it was mere feet away, I held up the axe to strike in self-defense, just as Thor would plummet his hammer upon those mythological giants of old. But before I could make contact with the edge of my weapon, a large, slimy tentacle‚Äîlike that of the great Kraken!‚Äîprotruded from the side abdomen of the monster, clutching to the head of my axe. A great struggle ensued, a grappling of a tool between that which was alive and that which was undead. Unfortunately for me, my opponent was able to seize the axe due to its enormous strength, almost taking me with it into its abysmal vacuum of a perverted body.¬†

The beast, beholding my only physical line of defense, snapped it in two, as primitive man would‚Äôve done to the weakly-branched weapon of his adversary. Having no other means to counter the hostile mariner who had seemingly raised from the dead‚Äî‚Äúit‚Äôs alive!‚Äù as Victor Frankenstein once so presciently said‚ÄîI could only turn and run, trying to avoid flailing tendrils.

I still remember that time I was trying to video call my sister, and my dog, thrilled by the sound of her voice, decided to parade directly between me and the phone. A cloud of white fur just floated into the air, catching the sunlight like a snow globe. I was so embarrassed, frantically trying to brush the hair off the couch with one hand while holding the phone with the other. It felt like a losing battle, a constant, fluffy reminder of my failure as a neat person.



It‚Äôs funny, my grandma used to sweep her kitchen every single evening without fail. It was just part of the rhythm of her day. I used to think I could have that same rhythm, but between work and everything else, the idea of sweeping three times a day is just impossible. That little dustpan by the back door started to feel less like a tool and more like a judgment. I‚Äôd come home tired and just sigh at the new layer of fur tumbleweeds gathered in the corners.



I finally mentioned this to a friend when I was over at her house, which always seems impossibly tidy despite her having two cats. I was complaininI'll share upfront how much it cost, because I know there's always this curiosity.g about the fur, and she just laughed and said, ""Yeah, I gave up on that fight a long time ago."" Then she nodded toward this little disc quietly making its way along the edge of her living room. It was just‚Ä¶ working. No fanfare, just silently collecting cat hair while we drank our coffee.

[https://amzn.to/4nKKVAF](https://amzn.to/4nKKVAF)

It was such a simple thing, but it changed my whole perspective. I started looking into it and found one that I could set to run on a schedule. Now, the little machine does its rounds in the afternoon, and I come home to clean floors. It‚Äôs not magic, but it feels like it. The best part is that I can finally just enjoy my dog without seeing every shed hair as a chore I‚Äôm neglecting.



It‚Äôs funny how a small change can lift a constant, low-grade stress you didn't even realize you were carrying. That little thing trundling around has given me back those small moments I‚Äôd otherwise spend sweeping‚Äîtime I‚Äôd much rather spend actually playing with the dog who creates the mess in the first place.

1nnwgpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1nnwgpf/dating_for_months_without_telling_him_im_trans/,Dating for Months Without Telling Him I‚Äôm Trans - Advice,"Hello everybody. As the title states, I (29 MTF) have been dating a 29 cis man for a few months. Things were wonderful, he treated me with respect, love, and with great communication. He‚Äôd take me out to great dates and overtime we opened up to each other about personal things in our lives. It truly felt like a dream come true. Only caveat is that I didn‚Äôt tell him I was trans. 

For the record, I transitioned very young, I am for the most part passable. I also don‚Äôt make my transness the centerfold of my life (I.e. I don‚Äôt talk about it with friends, at work, or don‚Äôt disclose it on social media, etc.) I am very private about my transition and gender history, but that‚Äôs not to say that I‚Äôm ashamed or keeping it a secret, if someone finds out I‚Äôm trans I am an open book and will whole heatedly share my experiences regarding being a trans woman. 

However, when it comes to dating I always tell the men I‚Äôm dating upfront at the beginning. Even before the first date. But this time it just went differently. We met organically in person as I was walking my dog and we walked by each other and he asked me out for coffee. I thought he was cute and I‚Äôm assuming vice versa. On the first date I was going to tell him, but first I asked him simple questions to get an idea of what his political/religious beliefs were. It seemed he was very open minded. The conversation was wonderful and the chemistry was great. And a small little part of me thought ‚Äúmaybe he already knows and just doesn‚Äôt care?‚Äù And that I just didn‚Äôt want to ruin what could be by dropping the big ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trans‚Äù bomb‚Ä¶ I know, this was where I messed up‚Ä¶

On our third date, he took me out to a really nice fancy dinner, we dressed up, he picked me up, the whole nine yards. During the dinner he goes on to say about how politically it‚Äôs bad how trans people are being treated. So I assumed AGAIN that maybe he knows and that he just doesn‚Äôt care so that‚Äôs why he hasn‚Äôt brought up my own transness or asked me questions about my transition‚Ä¶ I went home with him and we slept together (I am post-op and have a well-working neo-vagina). 

Flash forward to a few dates later now, things begin to get more serious and the topic of children comes up. He gives the indication that eventually he would like some. He also asked if I‚Äôm on birth control‚Ä¶ that was the moment I internally panicked and realized that this man truly doesn‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm trans. So I had to do it‚Ä¶ I told him I was trans. 

He was very shocked. Very quiet. And I felt like a monster. I told him how sorry I was for not telling him sooner. But he ultimately said it was a dealbreaker, but he doesn‚Äôt regret getting to know me and that he wishes me well. I was devastated and heartbroken because everything was so wonderful until I told him I was trans. 

I want to reach out to him to ask for another chance. Is that a good idea? Do I just let it go? It‚Äôs been 2 days since I told him. Any advice or how to move forward would be great. Thank you.",8,1758570255.0,asktransgender,2,1.0,False

1nnwcr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nnwcr1/friendship_situationship_or_genuine_interest/,"Friendship, situationship, or genuine interest?","I (M31) am pretty foreign to the dating world. I got married way too young (20) to my high school crush/girlfriend and had a couple kids with her before I turned 24. We ended up growing into adults with very different wants/clashing personalities and divorced because we were both miserable. We share custody of the kids. 

Ive tried dating a little over the past 6 years of being single, mostly shitty apps because I work a lot and am pretty shy. Not a lot of dates, but most didn‚Äôt last but 2-3 dates. So needless to say, I‚Äôm pretty inexperienced in a lot of the romantic skills these days. Lol

This woman (F30) started working at my company about 2 years ago. My first impressions of her were that she was, 1: Gorgeous; and 2: not very pleasant to interact with. We don‚Äôt interact much at work anyway (different shifts, departments, etc), so I mostly wrote her off as someone I wouldn‚Äôt get along with much. Fast forward about a year and she‚Äôs grown on me quite a bit; I realized that the source of most of my initial distaste was just the pressure she was under from the jump on her new job. She‚Äôs pretty successful for her age as well, which I know isn‚Äôt the easiest for a woman without being a little forceful in personality.

Anyway, we bump into each other in a bar/smoke lounge briefly one evening as the first time really being aware of each other outside of work. The next day she messages me outside of work and starts a small random conversation. We chat back and forth for a few weeks and are fairly friendly, but she‚Äôs a really bad texter (her own admission; she says she does better with phone calls, which I‚Äôm terrible at, of course).

I finally say screw it and ask her out for coffee and she (to my amazement) agrees and we set a day/time. The day comes and she doesn‚Äôt show, so message her to check in and she says she wasn‚Äôt sure if we were still on, but we could get together for a bit before she leaves town that afternoon. I‚Äôm not too sure about it at this point, but I agree and we make an impromptu plan to meet and have a couple of beers. It was alright, but the circumstances left me feeling unsure, so I thought I would let it go.

She continues to be friendly, but sporadic and distant in communication. She‚Äôs still just barely showing enough interest in the friendship that I end up inviting her off the cuff to a get together at a brewery for my birthday. She‚Äôs ends up coming and buying a couple shots we do together. We chat a bit, but it‚Äôs loud and I have a lot of friends there, so she eventually tells me she‚Äôs bad with crowds, hugs me, and leaves.

I tried asking her out for some food at one point had she‚Äôs busy, but suggests maybe another day; I agree. We didn‚Äôt have concrete plans, but a loose idea, which eventually falls through. She‚Äôs from out of state originally, so I invite her to go to the local festival one weekend. She agrees and we share some drinks, some food, play some games, a couple gummies, etc. It was alright, but felt a little stiff. I attribute it mostly to me being super awkward and rusty/inexperienced.

She‚Äôs still very sparse with communication, but always still seems genuinely happy to see me when we bump into each other at work, so I‚Äôm left feeling pretty confused. I‚Äôm really inexperienced and shy, so the idea of ‚Äúchasing‚Äù a girl is really hard for me. She hasn‚Äôt given me any obvious signs that she wants me to back off, but I‚Äôm also unsure if I‚Äôm being too vague in my interests. I ride a motorcycle, so I jokes with her about when she was going to get on two wheels and she fired back pretty quickly with ‚ÄúWhen are you going to give me a ride?‚Äù I‚Äôm trying to set that up, but am just unsure of the whole situation.

She‚Äôs honestly great. We don‚Äôt know each other super well still, but pretty much everything I learn about her makes me like her more. She‚Äôs out of my league physically, but I think I‚Äôve got a decent personality, so I‚Äôm hoping that makes up for it. Lol

Obviously I‚Äôm cooked if she sees this, because there‚Äôs enough detail here for her to immediately know, but honestly, her coming out and telling me she‚Äôs not interested would be better at this point than not knowing. She‚Äôs super cool and I would love to be her friend, regardless.

Am I being led on, reading too much into it, or just being an idiot in some other way? I would classify myself as an over communicator and a little clingy maybe, so I‚Äôm actively trying to factor that in and fight against that. I know not everyone communicates the same. I‚Äôm pretty hard on myself, so it‚Äôs taken every little bit of interest shown and all of my willpower to keep from writing it off completely.

TL;DR: Being a single dad in his 30s is hard and am insecure about being interesting to someone I like, as well as being unsure about her interest level from mixed amounts of communication.",0,1758570001.0,dating_advice,4,0.5,False

For school there's a short story competition I'm gonna submit this in.

Thanks for taking a look, this is it here.

7:03AM, Stanley woke up in a sweat for the 4th time this week. ‚ÄúIt happened again,‚Äù he says to Elaine, his wife.¬†

Elaine quickly sits up in bed, half asleep. ‚ÄúWhat was it about this time?‚Äù she replies, fetching a notebook.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fully remember, it was the same long staircase and shadowy figure.‚Äù¬†

Elaine, while writing this information down, says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm¬†telling you; you should go to dream therapy.¬†You‚Äôll¬†find out lots about yourself.‚Äù¬†

Stanley rolls his eyes. ‚ÄúNot this again, Elaine, you know I¬†don‚Äôt¬†believe in star signs and whatnot. Why would you think it would be different about my dreams having some meaning?‚Äù¬†

Elaine‚Äôs smile faded; she clicked her pen shut and set the notebook aside.¬†

Stanley doubles down. ‚ÄúWhat? You think¬†there's¬†a hidden decoded message I need to figure out? I just need to get some pills for it.‚Äù¬†

Elaine rolls over in bed and goes back to sleep while Stanley gets out of bed and gets ready for work at 8:30AM.¬†

While walking down the busy streets of Manhattan, Stanley is pondering about the recurring dreams and accidentally bumps into someone, spilling his morning coffee. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Stanley muttered.¬†

Stanley, finishing the walk to his office building, is convincing himself the dreams are nothing and Elaine was simply overreacting. Although, the memory of the staircase lingered at the back of his mind.¬†

Stanley clocks out at 5:00PM and stops by his local pharmacy on the way home to pick up magnesium. ‚ÄúThis will do the trick,‚Äù Stanley says while walking home to his apartment.¬†

Stanley is at his front door with bloodshot eyes and heavy eyebags, trench coat on and magnesium in hand. He takes a deep breath in and out and puts on a smile for Elaine.¬†

He unlocks the door and walks into the sitting room where Elaine would usually be watching her soap opera¬†that‚Äôs¬†on at this hour. ‚ÄúElaine, I‚Äôm home,‚Äù Stanley shouts.¬†

He walks upstairs to his bedroom and opens the door. Elaine and someone Stanley¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†recognise are in their bedroom, looking serious.¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù Stanley asks.¬†

‚ÄúAn intervention.‚Äù¬†

Stanley becomes serious. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you two get on with it then, there‚Äôs a game on, so I won‚Äôt disturb.‚Äù¬†

Elaine and her friend look confused. Stanley looks at Elaine‚Äôs friend while slowly leaving the room, as if he has intruded.¬†

‚ÄúYou can get through what it is you‚Äôre going¬†throug‚Äî‚Äù Elaine‚Äôs friend begins.¬†

‚ÄúNot about her, Stanley! About you,‚Äù Elaine interrupts.¬†

Stanley fully walks into the room and shuts the door behind him, bewildered. ‚ÄúAbout me? Why would I need one?‚Äù he asks, almost offended.¬†

‚ÄúYour dreams. Something about this¬†isn‚Äôt¬†right! And Claire agrees. Lucky for you,¬†she‚Äôs¬†a specialist in dreams and can tell you what they mean.‚Äù Elaine gestures to the woman next to her.¬†

Stanley¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†know what to say, shocked at how serious his wife is taking this. He kindly ushers Claire out while Elaine is not pleased.¬†

‚ÄúWhy would you be so rude‚Äî‚Äù Elaine begins.¬†

‚ÄúI just want to go to bed, we can talk tomorrow. I got medicine for myself, so¬†it‚Äôll¬†be fine. Goodnight,‚Äù Stanley cuts her off.¬†

Elaine stays silent and rolls over in bed.¬†

6:53AM. After a night of tossing and turning, Stanley wakes up in a sweat again and grabs his notebook, trying to remember details.¬†

‚ÄúLet me guess, it happened again,‚Äù Elaine says.¬†

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Stanley lies, ashamed to admit he wants help.¬†

Elaine knows he is lying, so she goes back to sleep.¬†

Stanley writes down:¬†Was walking around and saw people laughing. One had black hair. They stopped laughing and looked dead at me. Forgot what happened next but something did, then I remember someone saying Echo and then I saw the staircase and woke up in a jolt again.¬†

Stanley is getting more anxious every night now, not knowing why this is happening. He is a man that loves solutions and answers.¬†

‚ÄúWhy am I doing this?‚Äù Stanley mutters, ashamed he‚Äôs writing this down but not asking for help.¬†

He starts his day early and writes a letter to Elaine:¬†I‚Äôm sorry. I would be willing to talk to Claire. See you later.¬†

Then he heads to work in a slightly better mood.¬†

After a long day of fidgeting at work, wondering if Elaine will accept his apology and pondering more about his dreams, he‚Äôs walking home.¬†

Stanley gets on the packed tube and freezes. He hears the same laugh from his dreams.¬†

His eyes come alive, and he starts moving his head frantically, looking at everyone¬†who‚Äôs¬†in a group. It¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†help.¬†

He rushes home and bolts in the front door to meet Elaine and Claire there.¬†

He gives Elaine a big hug and asks Claire for help, filling her in on everything. Minutes of talk turn into hours.¬†

‚ÄúOkay, you understand the plan?‚Äù Claire asks.¬†

Stanley nods.¬†

‚ÄúExplain it to me so I know you understand.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúFor the next hour before I sleep, I count my fingers five times for a reality check, so I trigger myself doing that in my dream hopefully, right?‚Äù¬†

Claire smiles and gives a thumbs up.¬†

For the next hour Stanley does that and then falls asleep.¬†

Stanley is looking at his fingers, tries counting them but it isn‚Äôt making sense.¬†

He realises he‚Äôs in a dream, in the same spot as usual.¬†

Frantically looking around for answers.¬†

Stanley hears the laugh and turns around.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to be here, are you?‚Äù the black-haired person says to Stanley.¬†

‚ÄúI know this is my mind playing tricks,‚Äù Stanley replies.¬†

‚ÄúYou wanted this. You asked to forget.‚Äù¬†

Stanley is confused but not intimidated.¬†

‚ÄúOur name is Echo.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you mean our‚Äî‚Äù Stanley begins.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not meant to stay small forever. The time has come. I‚Äôll guide you back tomorrow.‚Äù¬†

7:13AM. Stanley wakes up in a sweat.¬†

‚ÄúHe talked to me this time,‚Äù Stanley says to Elaine.¬†

‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù she replies.¬†

‚ÄúNothing really, gibberish nonsense,‚Äù Stanley insists, trying to act tough.¬†

‚ÄúOkay then, I‚Äôm going to go back to bed. See you later. I‚Äôll tell Claire,‚Äù Elaine says.¬†

At 8:04AM, Stanley is on the tube. He sees Echo.¬†

Stanley does a double take, and right when he notices Echo, Echo gets off the tube.¬†

Stanley follows.¬†

Echo is picking up pace, not trying to lose him, just walking faster.¬†

Stanley shouts at Echo in the tube station and everyone turns their head. He looks like a madman.¬†

Echo walks into a room right outside of the tube station. Stanley follows.¬†

It‚Äôs pitch black. The room morphs, the door disappears, and stars appear above him.¬†

He looks ahead and he sees the staircase, and at the top is Echo.¬†

Stanley can‚Äôt feel his feet on the floor anymore.¬†

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù Stanley shouts, shaking and confused, tearing up.¬†

‚ÄúWhy are you crying, Stanley?‚Äù Echo asks. ‚ÄúThis is what you wanted.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúPlease, let me go back to normal,‚Äù Stanley begs. ‚ÄúI want to go back to my job. Please, I want my wife and my apartment and my job. The way it‚Äôs always been.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing I can do, Stanley,‚Äù Echo replies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not real. None of this is. It‚Äôs only you. Come join me.‚Äù¬†

Echo reaches his hand out from the top of the stairs.¬†

Stanley begins the climb.¬†

Each step he takes brings tears and lost memories flashing back: constellations forming, black holes collapsing, the birth of stars.¬†

As he is about to reach the top step, he remembers the last memory‚Äîseeing a little blue dot and wanting to be small.¬†

Stanley sees himself standing at every level of the stairs at once, child, stranger, star, galaxy,¬†until they all merge into one.¬†

Stanley is now face to face with Echo, who is unrecognisable.¬†

Echo is everything Stanley once was.¬†

‚ÄúI remember,‚Äù Stanley cries out.¬†

Echo holds his finger out to him. ‚ÄúTouch our finger, and we can go back to how we were. The universe. We have all the time in the galaxy.‚Äù¬†

Stanley puts his finger out, about to touch Echo‚Äôs, but turns back to look at Earth for a beat.¬†

He remembers his wife, helping people in need, the small things that make people human.¬†

Stanley looks back at Echo. Echo nods in understanding.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you soon. I always do.‚Äù¬†

Stanley blinks, and¬†he‚Äôs¬†standing back in¬†the busy streets of Manhattan.¬†

He looks up at the sky, with his new understanding.¬†

The clouds swirl like galaxies. Just for a second, for him to notice.¬†

I'm from mediterrenian, more exactly Albania. If you dont know coffee here is a big deal. We have more coffee shops per capita in the entire world. While many shops may not have the nicest shiny beans they do make some pretty damn good espressos. But shops use business grade espresso machines, sometimes they rent them or sell them for 500-1k.

I want to buy one for my home since i work remotely. Buying a business grade one makes no sense even if i find them cheap. They consume too much energy and you need to wait a lot for the machine to get hot.

For the past years i have a shitty lavazza, like 50$ machine. I buy each capsule at 0.5$ and they still suck. On top of that you can find the same capsule for max 1 month as either the stores change them or the brand removes them. Keep in mind we have no amazon or alike here.

Im tired of this machine.

To add, relative of mine bought a 200$ delonghi machine. It sucks still. I just bought a pack of amazing coffee abroad and tried it out, it does not compare at all, it sucks totally. Part of it is because the grind was extra fine, like 2.5. I have tried buying from coffee shops and tastes like water.

Another friend has bought an expensive delonghi, around 800$ and says the same.

Now, either we in Albania are used to good espresso that is not possible to get with consumer grade machines or we are doing something very wrong. The coffee is like water and ugly.

To explain, i dont care about anything else, i only want good espresso. No 1L cup junk, no milk no bs :/

Im not sure what to do atm, there are no places here to test an espresso machine. Even buying them locally costs double the price and purchasing online slaps a hefty tax. I cannot just test things out.

My family even celebrates the b-days of deceased loved ones. Cake, flowers, donuts, balloons, coffee, etc. all nicely set up in the morning. 

She immediately started screaming at me on the phone, said I must not be her child, threatened to kick me out even though I pay my portion of rent, calling me a disgrace, etc. She's now threatening to tell my boyfriend what a bad person I am and is threatening my relationship as a whole. 

I gave up my childhood for her, to help raise my sick brother bc my dad left.

**Who this is for:** you‚Äôre stuck refreshing chats, stalking socials, and riding anxiety spikes about your SP.

**Core idea:** 3D (physical world) is the **effect**. We change the **cause** (state/identity + nervous system) first.

# Phase 1 ‚Äî Interrupt (Minutes 0‚Äì15)

1. **Phone brake (10 min).**
   * Mute notifications for 24h.
   * Move chat/social apps to a hidden folder named **‚ÄúLater‚Äù**.
   * Optional: timer-lock apps (2 hours).
2. **Body first (3√ó).**
   * Breathe. Inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4. Repeat 3 times.
   * Whisper: *‚ÄúEven now, I am safe. I am chosen.‚Äù*
3. **Name it (1 min).**
   * Write one line: *‚ÄúThis sensation is anxiety, not truth.‚Äù*

# Phase 2 ‚Äî Reinstall Identity (15‚Äì25 min)

**Journal‚Äî3 prompts (1‚Äì2 lines each):**

* *If he were already here, how would my body feel right now?*
* *A woman who is already chosen spends her next hour doing‚Ä¶*
* *One micro-proof I‚Äôll create today to back my identity is‚Ä¶* (e.g., gym, work sprint, self-date, boundary)

**Single affirmation (on loop for 2 min):**

*‚ÄúI am the woman who is loved, chosen, and calm. My world reflects me.‚Äù*

# Phase 3 ‚Äî Attention Budget (The Next 24 Hours)

* **0 checking windows** in the first **2 hours**.
* After that: max **two** pre-planned ‚Äútech windows‚Äù of **5 minutes** each (calendar them).
* Outside those windows: no scroll, no stalk, no ‚Äúpeek.‚Äù You‚Äôre training your nervous system to trust *you* again.

**Swap habit (choose 1):**

* 25-minute deep-work sprint
* 20-minute walk without phone
* 10-minute SATS (see Phase 5)
* Self-date: coffee + book, no socials

# Phase 4 ‚Äî Language Audit (5 min)

Replace these auto-thoughts for 24h:

* ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs ignoring me.‚Äù ‚Üí **‚ÄúSilence is old echo. I lead now.‚Äù**
* ‚ÄúI ruined it.‚Äù ‚Üí **‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs ruined. I‚Äôm reinstalling my state.‚Äù**
* ‚ÄúI need proof.‚Äù ‚Üí **‚ÄúMy calm is the proof.‚Äù**

Save as notes. Read 3√ó/day.

# Phase 5 ‚Äî 5-Second SATS Loop (Night)

* Lie down, body relaxed.
* Replay a **5-second** ‚Äúalready together‚Äù clip (e.g., your living room, his arm around you, you both laugh).
* Feel the *after-glow*, not the chase.
* Loop 2‚Äì3 minutes. Sleep.

# Day 2 ‚Äî Congruence Check (10 min)

**Morning 3-point check:**

* *Body:* 3 breaths + hand on heart ‚Üí tension drops?
* *Behavior:* did I keep my attention budget?
* *Being:* one congruent action today (workout, pitch, boundary, study).

**If you relapse (you checked):**

* No self-attack. 3 breaths + *‚ÄúI lead again.‚Äù*
* Restart the 2-hour no-check window.

# 7-Day Maintenance (keep it simple)

* 1 identity line (same one) morning & night.
* 1 SATS loop nightly (max 3 min).
* 2 pre-planned tech windows/day or fewer.
* Weekly ‚ÄúAttention Audit‚Äù: where did my energy go?

# Do / Don‚Äôt

**Do:** regulate first ‚Üí speak/act from calm ‚Üí hold one identity line.  
**Don‚Äôt:** stack 12 techniques from panic, write paragraphs to ‚Äúfix it,‚Äù or hunt for signs.

# Optional one-line message (only if aligned)

If you genuinely feel calm and choose to reach out:

‚ÄúHey, hope you‚Äôre well. No rush to reply‚Äîjust sharing a good thought of you.‚Äù

Send once. Release. Your identity‚Äînot the text‚Äîleads.

# Save this

If this helped, **save** it and revisit for 48 hours.

You can see my previous trip report here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/disneylandparis/comments/1j1xy7z/disneyland\_paris\_with\_a\_2\_year\_old\_toddler\_trip/](https://www.reddit.com/r/disneylandparis/comments/1j1xy7z/disneyland_paris_with_a_2_year_old_toddler_trip/)  My general thoughts on visiting DLP with a toddler haven‚Äôt changed so instead of repeating all that, this time I just wanted to share some thoughts on our hotel and the restaurants we enjoyed.¬†

For this trip I chose to stay at Sequoia Lodge and I absolutely loved it! I see why it‚Äôs a bit of a fan favourite hotel out of all the DLP options and I‚Äôll definitely be back once it‚Äôs renovated to see the new rooms.¬†I can only compare it to Newport Bay where I stayed in February but I‚Äôd now chose Sequoia over Newport every time, especially as Sequoia tends to run cheaper. The rooms were very similar in size, layout, amenities, etc. and I found the level of cleanliness to be similar (good) in both. The flaws (lack of plug sockets / charging points, dated style, long corridors) are also the same in both hotels. So it really comes down to which theming you prefer and I think Sequoia is better hands-down. It‚Äôs hard to describe but for me the hotel just had a better overall atmosphere and definitely achieved the cosy, USA-National-Park-vibe it‚Äôs going for. Sitting outside on the front deck with a coffee, surrounded by pine trees, was so tranquil and I could‚Äôve been a world away from Disneyland.¬†

I would highly recommend booking a room close to the hotel facilities - this is a separate category when making your reservation. This gets you a room in the main building which I very much appreciated, especially when I saw how far away some of the other lodges can be! We got very lucky and ended up in the north wing, 2nd floor, which is the same floor as the lobby. If you want to go to the character meet & greets each morning, then being near the lobby is especially handy.¬†

Now onto food. Our total spend for 2 adults and 1 two-year-old was ¬£278.70 which I think was pretty good! That included 6 meals (1 buffet dinner at Agrabah Cafe, 2 quick service dinners and 3 quick service lunches) and some small snacks such as cookies, popcorn, coffee each day.¬†

It was my first time at Agrabah Cafe and I was really impressed. I am vegan and my mum is vegetarian, so this had come highly recommended as the best buffet for those dietary requirements and it lived up to the hype. There were around 10 vegan savoury options (inc. salads, olives, bread, falafel, pasta) and 3 vegan desserts (pear and almond cake, lemon tart, chocolate & passion fruit entremets) plus fruit. For vegetarians there was another 10 or so dishes, so loads of choice. As with all buffets, under 3s eat for free so it worked out as quite good value for us as my daughter eats quite a lot!¬†

For quick service meals, the highlights were Colonel Hathis and Casa de Coco - these are my go-to's in the park! I also tried the vegan burger at the new Hollywood Gardens Restaurant but it was pretty average.¬†

Happy to answer any questions about Sequoia, vegan/veggie food in the park, or anything else I‚Äôve mentioned!¬†",10,1758569218.0,disneylandparis,0,1.0,False

If you‚Äôve ever wandered into the world of Bitcoin, you‚Äôve probably run into two things that feel almost magical: Bitcoin ATMs (a.k.a. BTMs) and QR codes. One looks like a futuristic money machine you might expect in a sci-fi movie, and the other looks like a digital puzzle square that somehow makes money move. Put them together, and you‚Äôve got yourself a recipe for fast, fun, and secure Bitcoin transactions. And guess what? You can dive right into the magic yourself with our **free Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** at [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

# The Rise of Bitcoin BTMs

Picture this: You‚Äôre out for a walk, maybe grabbing a coffee, and there it is‚Äîstanding proudly in the corner of a convenience store or mall lobby‚Äîa Bitcoin ATM. Unlike traditional ATMs that cough out paper bills, these bad boys let you buy or sell Bitcoin on the spot. No complicated sign-ups, no waiting days for a bank transfer. You stick in some cash, scan a code, and *bam!* you‚Äôve got Bitcoin in your wallet before your latte gets cold.

Bitcoin ATMs (BTMs for short) have been popping up all over the world. They‚Äôre like little Bitcoin ambassadors, making crypto accessible to everyday people. Whether you‚Äôre in Toronto, Miami, or Tokyo, there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll spot one glowing away, quietly bridging the gap between old-school cash and the digital future of money.

# Where QR Codes Come Into Play

Now here‚Äôs where things get interesting. If BTMs are the stage, QR codes are the star performers. These little black-and-white pixel squares aren‚Äôt just pretty patterns‚Äîthey‚Äôre Bitcoin‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make this easy.‚Äù Instead of typing out a ridiculously long Bitcoin address (seriously, who wants to type 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa without messing it up?), you just scan a QR code.

At a BTM, QR codes save the day. You scan your wallet‚Äôs QR code when you‚Äôre buying Bitcoin so the machine knows exactly where to send it. When you‚Äôre selling, the BTM shows *you* a QR code that you send Bitcoin to. It‚Äôs smooth, it‚Äôs fast, and it feels a bit like scanning into a secret club for digital money nerds.

# Why You Need a Bitcoin QR Code Maker

That‚Äôs where our app comes in. With the **Bitcoin QR Code Maker**, creating your own Bitcoin QR code is a breeze. Whether you‚Äôre setting up a payment option for your small business, asking a friend to repay you for pizza, or just showing off how futuristic your wallet address looks, our tool makes it simple and free. No downloads, no fees‚Äîjust instant QR codes you can share, print, or even stick on a flyer if you‚Äôre feeling creative.

Visit [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), type in your Bitcoin address, and watch as your shiny new QR code appears. Hand it to a friend, scan it at a BTM, or slap it on your website. Boom‚Äîcrypto transactions simplified.

# Wrapping It Up

Bitcoin ATMs and QR codes are proof that the crypto world doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. They‚Äôre the peanut butter and jelly of digital finance: one gives you access to Bitcoin in the real world, the other makes sending and receiving it effortless. And with the Bitcoin QR Code Maker, you‚Äôve got the tools to join the fun with just a few clicks.

So next time you spot a glowing Bitcoin ATM, remember‚Äîyou‚Äôve already got the secret weapon to make the experience smoother: your very own free QR code.",1,1758569212.0,u_SelectionOptimal7348,0,1.0,False
1nnw0dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nnw0dv/i_might_have_accidentally_fallen_in_romantic_love/,I might have accidentally fallen in romantic love with my roommate,"Hey internet. I 32M might have fallen in romantic love with my roommate, 33F and I can't be sure what to do about it. We're both ace, she's also aro, she says. It's complicated, because she's also become very important to me, calls me her best friend and has been doing that since before she moved in with me. These days I find myself spending almost all my time with her. She seems confused by this, encourages me to go do other things, or whatever. I have other friends, we have other friends in the same circle, and she's got friends from the next town over and all over that she spends time with too, but I seem to have the most fun when I'm with her. We have a lot of stuff in common and get along alright for the most part. There are times I wish we had more space...who doesn't...and yet even when she asks if I do need the space I find myself not exactly wanting it. I like the comfortable silence when we're both working on stuff together. Treasure it, actually. She's an amazing cook, too, which astounds me because I hate cooking and I don't understand how people get good at it, especially since I never see her measuring anything or reading recipes. She shares what she makes with me and our friends without a second thought, which... didn't exactly happen for me when I lived with other people. It's odd. But she's said these acts of service tend to be her love language and I got thinking... does she mean platonic love or... ? and I'm confused.

It's more than that, though. We have fought, and those arguments have been painful and annoying and rage inducing because that's how humans are. She has baggage which leans into her story and why she moved in with me to begin with. She is sad a lot, and struggles with a lot of her past and her body image and old strained friendships, but... she tells me all about it. She said she feels safe with me. She trusts me, and I trust her and have also shared some pretty deep shit I haven't told any of our other friends or even some of my family. We get through our shit together, and each time I can't help but think this girls the strongest person I've ever met in my entire life. She hates when she lashes out, but I see through the crap and I tell her so, and I mean it, but I say it so she'll smile again or laugh.

I find myself safe with her also. I've got a habit of wanting to hug her every time I see her. She laughs and reaches back for me, too, sometimes for no reason. She greets me after work if she's home from the bookstore first and tells me she missed me even if we've only been gone for a shift. She'll ruffle my hair, too, especially if I've said something particularly stupid or funny. When its cold, she'll grab my hands for a second, like ""can you believe this shit, why do we live in a place this far north"" (no idea, I say, at least we're not american.) I have dreamt of us being mundane together, grocery shopping, talking, making coffee, flying back to her hometown together, and it feels perfect. She says I've talked to her across the house in my sleep when she gets up before me and she laughs, but, I can imagine it's only because my sleeping brain wants her around too.

But I'm scared that if I tell her all of this, I fuck it up. I end the dream. She leaves me and moves out and then I have to live without that laugh and crooked smile of hers and her awful beautiful accent. She doesn't see herself as worthy, she's said as much herself, of actual love. She has confided in me that she doesn't feel like girlfriend or wife material because of how ace she is and because she experiences love differently. She told me about an ex once who used that against her and cheated on her and I have never wanted to punch a dude so badly before in my life.

But I don't want to ruin things because I feel I'm not in a good enough place to be good to her or for her either. I don't find her attractive physically that way probably because of my ace neurodivergent brain, but the rest of her I love without reason. I see her and ninety percent of the time the day is better. I start my day with her and end it and wherever she is I feel like I'm finally home. I don't deserve her I think. And I wonder if she thinks the same. And I don't know what to do, or how to have this conversation or if I even should.

But typing this out feels cathartic, dudes.

‚ÄãSo, I‚Äôve struggled with social anxiety my whole life, and I'm tired of how hard it is to make friends and find a real community as an adult. I'm dreaming of creating a physical place in my town where people can connect without the usual pressure of bars or clubs.

‚ÄãThe idea is pretty simple: a safe and cozy spot with a few different things going on:

‚ÄãA real space for group therapy: I'd team up with a local psychologist to offer affordable, in-person sessions.

‚ÄãA super low-key social club: Think board games, movie nights, workshops. No pressure, just a place to be around people.
‚ÄãSmall English classes: I have an English degree, so I figured I could run some classes to help people out.

‚ÄãA simple coffee corner: Not a full caf√©, just something to make the place feel warm and help pay the bills.

‚ÄãNow, here‚Äôs the plot twist and where I'm stuck.
‚ÄãMy family has 4 small, empty houses that I could probably use. The location is surprisingly good (it's in an up-and-coming area with a lot of new development. The resource is there.

‚ÄãBut everyone gives the same good advice: ""Build the community first, before you have a place.""

‚ÄãAnd for someone like me (an introvert who is genuinely scared of putting myself out there) that feels like an impossible task. I want to build this for people like me, but my own anxiety is the biggest roadblock. I'm honestly frozen and don't know how to take the first step.

‚ÄãSo, I need your help. What would you do in my shoes?
‚ÄãHow do you even test if people are interested in an idea like this with literally no money? How do you find the first few people who ""get it""?

‚ÄãWhat‚Äôs a small, not-terrifying first step I could take this week? Seriously, the smallest, simplest thing possible.

‚ÄãHow do you approach a professional, like a psychologist, with an idea like this without sounding like you're just a dreamer?

‚ÄãAny ideas for funding something that's a business, but not just about making money? I can't ask my family for financial help right now.

‚ÄãI‚Äôm open to any and all advice, even if it‚Äôs a tough reality check. Thanks for listening.

‚ÄãTL;DR: I'm an introvert with social anxiety who wants to start a community hub. I have the perfect empty houses for it, but I'm too scared to take the first step of finding the ""community"" first.

I shared a little bit about each fragrance I selected too ‚ò∫Ô∏è (they‚Äôre focused far more on vibes than notes - I have actual reviews on many of them either posted already or coming soon). Feel free to ask about any of them! I love to share my thoughts. 

Palm
- *Lolita Lempicka Le Parfum*: a powder smooth complexion, silver body glitter and dark skin glowing in the moonlight, cherry slushie stained lips, and purple LEDs in a fogged up car in the twilight of late summer. 

- *Fleurit Fleur De Tabac*: black lingerie and a full-bodied, smoky whiskey in a hazy cloud of tobacco smoke and vanilla incense. Seduction and long nights listening to R&B on the radio with a lover.

- *Dolce & Gabbana Devotion*: orange cupcakes still warm from the oven topped with vanilla icing and lemon zest; humming in a sun bathed kitchen.

- *Fleurit G√¢teau Des Anges*: sweet cereal milk after eating Fruity Pebbles, jelly lemon candies with the sugar rinds, sugary peach rings, and the powder left on your fingertips after eating Smarties. Whimsical, delicate, sweet, and gentle. Trick-or-treating with angels. 

- *Lavandes Trianon*: a milky lavender latte topped with fluffy whipped cream enjoyed while chatting with a friend in a cozy little coffee shop.

Tray 
- *Philosophy Fresh Cream Warm Cashmere*: cozy, warm, and vanillic with a juicy tangerine note and a subtle sweetness. Fluffy socks and thick blankets in a candlelit room. 

- *Fili Di Parfumo Timeless Cashmere*: cozy, warm, and vanillic. Similar to Fresh Cream Warm Cashmere but even less sweet and without the tangerine. Soft cashmere sweaters the color of oatmeal and small heirloom gold hoop earrings. 

- *Dolce & Gabbana Devotion Intense*: a warm, sweet, nutty, and spicy take on the original Devotion. Cozy, seductive, and sweet with a bit of a masculine facet from the hazelnut. This used to be a scrubber for me but my nose recently had a change of heart!

- *Curations By The Good Scent Manifest Your Future*: the aromas of fried vanilla ice cream, syrupy fruit toppings, and caramel swirling in the air at the annual back-to-school festival.

I had been looking forward to a relaxing weekend, but instead, I think I just created the perfect storm of embarrassment......***

***It all started with one of those long, painfully corporate emails from my boss. You know the type: dense paragraphs, full of jargon, and somehow making a short update feel like a 500-page thesis. This one was brimming with phrases like ‚Äúsynergize deliverables,‚Äù ‚Äúoptimize verticals,‚Äù and ‚Äúpivot proactively to maximize cross-functional efficiency.‚Äù I was already exhausted, coffee had barely kicked in, and I just wanted to vent about it to my coworker.***

***So naturally, I highlighted the email, hit forward, and typed:***

>

***I laughed to myself, thinking my coworker would get it, we‚Äôd share a moment of Friday humor, and life would go on.***

***Except‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt hit forward. I hit Reply All.***

***At first, I didn‚Äôt even realize. Then, within seconds, the horror hit me like a ton of bricks. My boss. HR. Every single employee in the company. All 247 of them. They just received my brutally honest commentary about my boss‚Äôs writing. My stomach dropped.***

***The panic set in immediately. My phone started buzzing like crazy. Teams notifications, pings, direct messages - all within a minute. HR pinged me first, asking if I‚Äôd like to schedule a ‚Äúbrief conversation‚Äù about the email. Then my boss replied with three simple, ominous words: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs discuss.‚Äù***

***Friday had officially gone from casual end-of-week vibes to full-blown nightmare mode. I tried to disappear into my chair, slouching as far as possible, hoping nobody could see me. My coworker? Sitting across from me, trying to look innocent but clearly silently dying of laughter.***

***For the next hour, I rehearsed my apology speech in my head. I imagined worst-case scenarios: being reprimanded, a formal warning, HR interrogations, or even some kind of Friday afternoon public embarrassment. My mind raced: Should I own up? Should I lie and say I ‚Äúaccidentally clicked Reply All‚Äù? Would that even make a difference?***

***Then came the meeting. My boss called me into a small conference room. I walked in like I was attending my own trial. Heart pounding, palms sweaty. I expected anger, disappointment, or at the very least, a pointed stare that could pierce steel.***

***But instead, my boss started laughing. Like full-on, uncontrollable laughter. Not the polite chuckle you give when someone tries to be funny in a meeting, but genuine, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this actually happened‚Äù laughter. I blinked, completely shocked.***

***He wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs one way to summarize my email.‚Äù***

***I felt a mix of relief and confusion. Was I really going to survive this? But then came the kicker- karma, of course, in true Friday style: ‚ÄúSince you clearly have strong opinions on corporate writing, you‚Äôre now in charge of drafting next week‚Äôs company-wide email.‚Äù***

***I froze. So, not only had I roasted my boss in front of the entire company, but now I was responsible for writing the next email they‚Äôd all read. On a Friday. Of course.***

***Walking back to my desk, I reflected on the lessons I learned:***

1. ***Never assume you‚Äôre forwarding something when you‚Äôre actually replying all.***
2. ***Fridays are dangerous for mistakes - everyone‚Äôs already checked out mentally.***
3. ***Humor can sometimes save your life‚Ä¶or get you assigned extra work.***
4. ***Coffee should always be your first line of defense in the morning, and maybe the afternoon too.***

***I sat down, trying to breathe, checking my Teams notifications, imagining all the possible ways people were reacting. Some were laughing, some were probably judging, and some were probably just confused about why ChatGPT had a stroke. My coworker kept giving me side-eye grins, clearly thrilled that my disaster had turned into some kind of Friday office entertainment.***

***As I start thinking about next week‚Äôs email, I realize I‚Äôve learned something crucial: embarrassment is temporary, but karma‚Ä¶well, karma is hilarious. Also, Fridays are a dangerous time to roast your boss, even accidentally.***

***TL;DR: It was Friday. I meant to forward a company-wide email to a coworker with a roast about my boss. Accidentally hit Reply All. Boss and everyone saw it. HR pinged me. Boss laughed, but now I‚Äôm in charge of writing the next email. Fridays are dangerous.***",1,1758568883.0,tifu,9,0.52,False

‚ÄãSo, I‚Äôve struggled with social anxiety my whole life, and I'm tired of how hard it is to make friends and find a real community as an adult. I'm dreaming of creating a physical place in my town where people can connect without the usual pressure of bars or clubs.

‚ÄãThe idea is pretty simple: a safe and cozy spot with a few different things going on:

‚ÄãA real space for group therapy: I'd team up with a local psychologist to offer affordable, in-person sessions.

‚ÄãA super low-key social club: Think board games, movie nights, workshops. No pressure, just a place to be around people.
‚ÄãSmall English classes: I have an English degree, so I figured I could run some classes to help people out.

‚ÄãA simple coffee corner: Not a full caf√©, just something to make the place feel warm and help pay the bills.

‚ÄãNow, here‚Äôs the plot twist and where I'm stuck.
‚ÄãMy family has 4 small, empty houses that I could probably use. The location is surprisingly good (it's in an up-and-coming area with a lot of new development. The resource is there.

‚ÄãBut everyone gives the same good advice: ""Build the community first, before you have a place.""

‚ÄãAnd for someone like me (an introvert who is genuinely scared of putting myself out there) that feels like an impossible task. I want to build this for people like me, but my own anxiety is the biggest roadblock. I'm honestly frozen and don't know how to take the first step.

‚ÄãSo, I need your help. What would you do in my shoes?
‚ÄãHow do you even test if people are interested in an idea like this with literally no money? How do you find the first few people who ""get it""?

‚ÄãWhat‚Äôs a small, not-terrifying first step I could take this week? Seriously, the smallest, simplest thing possible.

‚ÄãHow do you approach a professional, like a psychologist, with an idea like this without sounding like you're just a dreamer?

‚ÄãAny ideas for funding something that's a business, but not just about making money? I can't ask my family for financial help right now.

‚ÄãI‚Äôm open to any and all advice, even if it‚Äôs a tough reality check. Thanks for listening.

‚ÄãTL;DR: I'm an introvert with social anxiety who wants to start a community hub.

So I changed all my bulbs (i have a small house so it's only 3, 1 for every floor) Put out a nest mini for every floor and put one of the wifi sockets between my coffee maker. 

I am loving it! Using the next speakers to control everything with my voice. It was awkward at first but I got used to it very quick! 

One of the things that really put me of last time is that I can not control it from my PC.  But this time I found the made a webapp. Great!!!

In the webapp there is also a feature to script automation! Awesome!!!

I made a few scripts and it's working great! 5 minutes before I wake up the lights turn on, my favorite radio station (radioparadise.com) starts playing on every floor and the coffee maker starts working! 

Immediately I thought. Now I can also start making custom voice triggers. But I haven't had much luck.

1nnvt0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nnvt0p/diagnosis_is_not_terminal/,Diagnosis is not terminal,"
So

Let's get off on the right foot here. Your coffee comes pouring out of your portafilter in a hot wet light brown rush, it sputters it spatters, crema‚Ä¶wot crema. It pours into your plastic beaker you splash some warm-ish milk on top and spoon in a couple of ladles of sugar‚Ä¶""Ambrosia"" you sigh. If it tastes good to you then YOU are doing it right -- you are your barista of choice. The key thing with coffee is taste and, subjectively if you cannot taste the bergamot over camp roasted hazelnuts then do not stress too much as I am not sure they guy who wrote those tasting notes could either but lets not get too personal.

There are some fundamentals that might assist though if you are dreaming of a perfect TikTok, Insta-story and want a perfect 28 second, 36 gram (2:1 ratio), thick unctuous crema and swirling tiger stripe pour to make your day and your reputation on r/espresso.

- **Beans**-- it really is mostly about the beans; rubbish in, rubbish out. If your beans are not up to it then you will spend a lot of time cleaning up the mess in you kitchen as you try ever more elaborate methods to get your not very good beans doing something -- anything that starts‚Ä¶
    - I get the beans ground at my local shop
    - I buy really nice ready ground beans
    - I have some coffee beans left over from a couple of birthdays ago
    - I get 500 grams of beans for US$1 from my local market

Will not end well!

- **The Grind** -- 90% of the ""What am I doing wrong here"" questions are solved by grinding finer
- **_Side bar_**‚Ä¶the fundamentals: what is an espresso the ""official"" definition:
    - ""_Espresso is a 25--35ml (.85--1.2 ounce [√ó2 for double]) beverage prepared from 7--9 grams (14--18 grams for a double) of coffee through which clean water of 195¬∞--205¬∞F (90.5¬∞--96.1¬∞C) has been forced at 9--10 atmospheres of pressure, and where the grind of the coffee is such that the brew time is 20--30 seconds. While brewing, the flow of espresso will appear to have the viscosity of warm honey and the resulting beverage will exhibit a thick, dark golden crema. Espresso should be prepared specifically for and immediately served to its intended consumer.""_
- So this is what you are aiming for if you want an espresso rather than something brown and hot. So back to it..
- **Variables** -- beans, beans, fresh (14 day old) beans, grind, puck prep, temperature, pressure (if you are lucky) -- did I mention beans.
- **Grind**-- have a good grinder, anything under US$100 -- you are on your own -- sorry a blade grinder, mortar and pestle, heal of your shoe or something you picked up in a garage sale -- you are on your own. Then weigh your beans‚Ä¶with scales and decide on your ratio.
- **Puck prep** -- do not get too carried away here; grind‚Ä¶bit of WDT but don't go mad (Weber have a lot to answer for), tamp lean or do yourself a favour an get a force tamper, if you wanna spend money then get some fancy insets but not sure they make much difference. Then weigh your shot to achieve your ratio 
- **Temperature** -- too hot and things get unpleasant
- **Pressure** -- hate to say this, good espresso gets better with variable pressure -- it just does‚Ä¶sorry and that means spending some money and that's possibly not cool with everyone
- **Too fast** -- ""really‚Ä¶really, really?!‚Ä¶grind [cannot bring myself to say it]""
- **Too slow** -- wow..good job you are at the backstop -- things can only get better
- **Too acid**-- too fast and too hot
- **Too bitter** -- too slow and possibly too cold
- So if you have a good machine, good grinder, good beans and a tamper you can make really good coffee..this may render a lot of your coffee station a bit redundant but if it makes you happy and a better coffee maker then go for it. I started with Rancilio Silva (temp surfing), Rocky grinder and a tamper‚Ä¶and one in four coffees was really very above average. Nowadays I have a lot more stuff -- and I am up to slightly above average after a decade or so
- **Muscle memory, smell memory, eye memory, experience memory** -- there is no substitute for experience and practice -- I watch the elaborate videos of folk industriously weighing, grinding, WDTing for an hour or so, mineral water-ing, flushing, brushing and blushing as they lock and load their ""precious"" into their machine and expect a dream shot miracle and are deeply upset that their 10th effort is not on a James Hoffman memorial page for great coffee of our time. It takes a while to get the feel and sense of what is working and what is just value added fluff. 
- **Be consistent**-- change things slowly and one at a time. Check in on yourself. Start with the grind and then fiddle about with other bits 

- And that's how it is..I am going to look at r/espresso just before I post this and see what the latest woe is‚Ä¶""Can someone rate my shot"" top three comments and I am giggling‚Ä¶taste..taste etc. Looks thin to me. Colour of pour is not convincing -- light roast? Crema equally unconvincing. Otherwise right amount right time and neatly done.",1,1758568731.0,espresso,0,0.67,False

1nnvrio,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1nnvrio/permanent_state_of_anxiety_brain_weirdness_after/,Permanent State of Anxiety + Brain Weirdness after Caffeine Overdose?,"Hi all,

To clarify, I have no formal anxiety diagnosis at the moment - I suspect I have had one from before (tried to get diagnosed but honestly was putting off booking the appointment) and I am currently in the process of getting diagnosed.

On Saturday, I took a 200mg caffeine pill at around 7pm, and another one at around 9:20pm ish.

That spiked my heart rate quite a lot as you can imagine, though this is not an unusual dosage for me. I wouldn't always do that amount but sometimes I did, and with no issue. I never had any negative side effects of using caffeine. Within the last year, I have also been drinking more energy drinks, and I also used one container of pre-workout when working out earlier in the year. I also began drinking coffee during work, including highly caffeinated beverages from Starbucks. All without issues. I would take caffeine as I felt I get very tired in the late afternoon/evening. I would also take it qhen I didnt get enough sleep. The only difference is I was trying a new brand - before I had the Sports Nutrition brand, and now I have WakeUps.

This time, I felt awful, and I went to the hospital where they did an ECG and found nothing wrong. On Sunday, I had what I felt like was a mini panic attack (heart racing, got really warm, head felt weird) for about 30 seconds. That prompted me to go to the hospital again - ECG and then blood work returned no results.

On Tuesday at work, I had a very bad attack, which put me in the emergency room - felt like I had to vomit, then I did not vomit but then my heart began to race and I felt very hot. They did another ECG test on me, along with a CT scan - everything looked good. The doctor gave me one 0.5mg pill of lorazepam to see if that would affect how I felt, I am going to take it tonight and see.

Wednesday morning, I saw my family doctor who prescribed five more lorazepam at 1mg each (in case 0.5 doesn't work to see if it works - if it does then she said to cut them in half) but she was again unsure what could cause this. I believe the intention is to report back to her to see if it works then go from there.

Thursday, the hospital has referred me to their diagnosis program where I would be evaluated by a nurse practitioner. I was also previously referred to a private psychology clinic for evaluation as well, but I have been putting off booking it (thoughts on nurse practitioner vs psychologist evaluation? I have money saved up for the private route).

Since Saturday, I have been experiencing brain fog/maybe derealization from reading around, random aches and pains (especially in my right leg), a huge amount of anxiety (racing thoughts about my current health condition, a little hard to fall asleep and stay awake, scared to be alone), ringing in my ears (sensation of right ear being plugged sometimes), occasional feeling of nausea, the feeling of sometimes wanting to cry but gagging when trying to, as well as a little bit of heightened emotions as well. I have had a few panic attacks in the past, but I have never had these symptoms (except anxiousness, which still wasn't this before, before September 13th.

I just want to know if anyone here has experienced a similar issue, what they think it is, if it'll go away, and how long it would take. Definitely not consuming caffeine anymore.",2,1758568632.0,decaf,4,1.0,False

You know, it‚Äôs funny. I was just making a cup of tea the other day and caught myself holding the kettle under the tap, hesitating for a second. I remembered visiting my grandparents as a kid and their water always had this distinct, almost metallic taste. We never thought twice about it back then; that was just how water was. Now, I find myself noticing the faintest chlorine scent, especially on a hot day. It‚Äôs not that I think it‚Äôs unsafe, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a sensation you become aware of.



It‚Äôs that invisible stuff that gets you thinking, isn‚Äôt it? You pour a glass of perfectly clear water and part of you wonders what‚Äôs actually in it. You can‚Äôt see anything, but sometimes the taste gives it away. I got a bit obsessed with reading about municipal water reports, which just left me more confused with all the technical terms. I wanted something simple, something that just made me feel assured without needing a chemistry degree.



Then, my partner brought home this simple glass jug one day. It didn‚Äôt look like much, just a sleek pitcher for the fridge. The magic was in this cartridge you fit in the top. You just fill it up from the tap and wait for the water to trickle through. The first time I tried it, the difference was in the silence of the water, if that makes sense? All those slight tastes were just gone.



Now, that jug lives on the top shelf of the fridge, always full. I love the sound of the water bubbling through when I refill it. It feels like a small, quiet ritual. My coffee tastes cleaner, and my glasses of water are just‚Ä¶ crisp. It‚Äôs one of those small changes that just settles a background worry you didn‚Äôt even know you had. It‚Äôs not a big machine, just a simple way to feel a little better about every sip.

At the time, I was very passionate about political science, so I ended up graduating from Generic American State University with a Political Science degree, and minors in Telecommunications and Music. I also wrote for the school paper editorial board and worked at the student-run radio station, and I'd had an internship at the State Capitol as well. 

 But since then, I've just been bouncing around for 15 years, pretty much quite literally. I managed a small, independent coffee shop for a bit after college, and then took a series of progressively different campaign jobs in different cities and states over the next decade. The usual steps of intern, finance assistant, field organizer, campaign manager (twice), and also was a digital organizer for a non-profit during the pandemic. 

  
I've also been a journalist for  a tiny town paper for a half a year in 2018, and between these contract roles, also worked as a server at restaurants off and on, and also as a bartender and some warehouse roles as well to pay the bills. 

  
Through a temp agency, I had a short contract 2 years ago for a financial services firm doing technical onboarding, and also got a contract job working for an educational non-profit doing technical onboarding as well. 

 

And I'm of course very well aware that I've had a litany of contract jobs, and across many cities and states, and that perhaps obviously doesn't help me or my case at all. 

 

After the educational role contract ended, I was lucky enough to have a friend I used to work with offer to let me stay with them while I try to retool and get back on my feet. (This is of course also not the place for it, but I've been dealing with a multitude of mental health issues, trauma, abuse from roommates and being assaulted, my car broke...etc blah blah) 

 

So I don't currently have any bills, beyond phone bill and a credit card payment. 

  
But since I moved back in with them, I've come to realize that I made a critical mistake after moving in, and keep unfortunately making it, and it's affecting not only my mental and physical health, but my financial health as well. 

 

In the last 11 or so months, I took a role as an assistant manager at a pizza place by a state college, where I ended up working 5 pm until 3/4 in the morning for $17 an hour 5 days a week, for 50 hours, and not even being able to get on my feet with that. And it's fine for some people, but I was losing my mind being up, and working 10 hours til 3 in the morning every day serving pizza to drunk kids tbh. I am NOT a night person, whatsoever. And then I took a role at a separate restaurant that ended up me still working until 11 pm or later serving chicken tenders and ice cream to kids and then dealing with loud line dancing crowds and dj nights at a crowded food court. And I have sensory issues as well (fun, fun, fun) And I was trapped in a 200 sq ft kitchen that seemed to be perpetually at about 120 degrees. I was also moonlighting working a couple days a week at an afro-caribbean restaurant bartending for lunch, but it was completely dead every day, and I'd make $200 every two weeks. 

 

I'm currently working a role I got through a friend I've made I train at the gym when our schedules match up. It's still nights, I work from 5-6 pm until 9/10 at the latest, basically cleaning offices, scrubbing toilets and taking out the trash in a small office building for $14 an hour Mon-Fri. 

  
Anyway, long story short. I apologize for the lengthy exposition. I just feel as though without giving a frame of reference, I might not be able to help myself get the help of good advice. 

 

So I've started to come to terms with the fact that I need to take a step back. NOT rush into the very first job I can get that's a restaurant/bar/second shift-third shift minimum wage job, if I'm to find a long-term career path. 

  
And IDK if I should consider going back and getting a second bachelors/masters degree. Something like actuarial science, computer/engineering, or medical, medical billing or what. IDK how great I am at math and some things but at this point I'm willing to try almost anything. 

 

I have a very low COL personally (obviously), and currently live in a moderately LCOL for the US. But eventually I'd like to go back to Colorado or somewhere. But I'm like a dog chasing its tail, with no tail. I don't even know where to start. 

 

And with this litany of mental health issues, and the inevitable struggles of mental health particularly post-pandemic, I find it hard to really focus and get my footing. I've applied at more temp places here for now. But TBH IDK if I really wanna stay here forever either. And with my near agorophobia, at times, and sensory issues, I really wouldn't mind finding another WFH/Remote role like many of mine were. But that's like pulling teeth. 

  
I love animals, and I""m good with them. So I thought even Vet School or something, but i know that doesn't pay very well. And it's a long process again. And I've thought even about somehow just finding a way to live on some farm with a log cabin and animals, if I knew how, and just raise them and figure it out? I genuinely am so lost. I almost became a personal trainer but haven't finished, that was a long time ago. I'm good with computers, but no certs or anything...again, sorry. I don't even know where to begin.",1,1758568574.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

It really drained my social battery and caused me a lot of anxiety. 

I told my bf on Sunday morning (while all our friends are still crashed on our couch) that I was drained and that it had been a long night (he had gone to bed and I had to be the one to tell everyone to keep it down/clean up etc) and that I really wanted everyone to make their way home that morning vs keep the partying going. He goes off saying ‚Äúwhat did I expect‚Äù and that he didn‚Äôt want to feel obligated for kicking people out - so I told him that we should all go on a walk get some coffee and that hopefully everyone would trickle out after that vs just sleeping the day away on my couch. 

So we do just that - except when we get to the restaurant for breakfast my bf announces that he is going to get a mimosa which obviously gets the rest of the group on board and drinking again.. something I WAS TRYING TO AVOID. 

Fast fwd to Sunday night (after our friends finally left at 5pm‚Ä¶) I was quiet and did not feel like socializing much - was just in my own corner of the bed trying to relax. My bf asks what wrong and I simply tell him that I am a bit in my head, that this weekend was a lot but that I‚Äôll be fine once I recharge. He asks if it has anything to do with him to which I say no (I really didn‚Äôt want to get into it)

Now this morning he asks if we‚Äôre okay to which I say yeah but that I‚Äôm still recovering from this weekend and need some space. 

He gets upset and asks if it has anything to do with him - I tell him that I‚Äôm not directly mad at him but that I felt as if everyone involved disrespected my boundaries and that he didn‚Äôt help me navigate the situation.

He then gets really angry with me saying I lied to him and wasn‚Äôt straight up about my feelings. That I caused him to overthink last night and I could have been more transparent about how I was feeling. That I am ruining his bday (his bday is tomorrow)  and making this all about myself. 

That our arguments are not logical because they‚Äôre not based on facts and only based on my feelings. He continues to go off on me saying a bunch of hurtful things and saying that I cause drama/start problems out of nowhere and can‚Äôt just be chill/go with the flow. 

This is exactly why I didn‚Äôt want to talk to him about it last night and was just trying to process my emotions and feelings on my own..

When we went: June 2025 @ Nomad & August 2025 @ Four Seasons Tower Bridge 

Who went: My wife and I 

Rooms booked: Superieur room @ Nomad on Hilton for Luxury rate @ 575GBP.

Deluxe suite @ Four Seasons Tower Bridge on FSPP non refundable rate @ 600 GBP.

Room upgrade: Upgraded to a parlour suite @ Nomad.

Upgraded to a heritage suite @ Four Seasons Tower Bridge 

Method of booking: I booked with our fabulous mod u/alex_travels

Tldr: @ Nomad the service was excellent, food was quite good, bar was fun, gym was nice, and location worked great for a show. The rooms are small and a little lackluster.

Tldr: @ Four Seasons Tower Bridge the room was large and quite nice, the hotel amenities were good, the pool and gym were nice, food was good, location was away from things, but really quiet, most service were great, but the restaurant had big issues. Weekend pricing was very good. 

Service: 

9.5: Nomad      

Service @ Nomad was excellent. The bell staff were quick to assist with luggage and bring them to the room. They were also quick to pick them up and arrange a cab. Check in and check out were a snap. Housekeeping quickly brought me an iron when requested. Turn down service was timely. Welcome amenities were in the room upon arrival.

Restaurant and bar service were outstanding. At dinner my wife had set her wine glass down on a piece of ice. The glass broke all over the place. 3-4 members of staff were over right away to check on us and clean everything up. They moved us to another table and brought out new appetizers and beverages. They offered to send my jacket to dry cleaning. I told them to charge me for the new items, which they refused and were very helpful.

Bar service @ Side Hustle was also very friendly and attentive. Being in house, even with a busy bar the hostess managed to get us seats quickly. 
Breakfast service @ Twenty8 was also very good, friendly, and attentive. We didn't utilize in room dining or spa treatments.

7.5: Four Seasons Tower Bridge

Service @ Four Seasons Tower Bridge was overall quite good. The bell staff were great, and quick with luggage and cabs. check in and check out were very pleasant. The spa staff were super friendly. The lobby bartender was great. Turn down service was timely. In room dining was excellent. We didn't utilize spa treatments.

The dinner service in the hotel restaurant was the worst service that I've experienced in a long time. The restaurant got pretty slammed with a private dining group of 12 or so just after we arrived, so this could have been a one off. The host took our drink order when he sat us and brought them right away. From there it took 45 minutes to order dinner, and only because I went and got the menus myself, then flagged down a member of management to ask if they could take our order. I server never made it to our table. 

Someone from management ended up being our server. There was an earnest effort, but there were additional issues, and it was just a poor experience.

Property:

8: Nomad

The Nomad has a pretty Central location in Covent Garden. It's across the street from the Royal Opera House. There are plenty of shops, restaurants, and transit stations close by. We'd arrived in town to jump on a cruise ship the next day. We went to the ballet at the opera house that evening, so the location was perfect for that.

The hotel has 91 rooms, including suites and still has a boutique feel to it. It was a former courthouse/jail that now has a 20's jazzy aesthetic. There's a good amount of artwork throughout, while the halls are a little dark.The atrium restaurant and space is the star of the property. It's lovely and super inviting. The bar is also lively and a lot of fun. 

The gym space was nice. There's 24 hour room service, a restaurant, bar, private dining + event space, various lounge spaces, a library space with all day dining, afternoon tea, and a spa. There isn't a pool. 

8.5: Four Seasons Tower Bridge

Four Seasons Tower Bridge is in the financial district and seems to serve as a business hotel. The exterior as well as the interior of the hotel are lovely. The aesthetic is very grand and classic. There's a lot of marble, dark wood, and everything is very sleek and clean. The entrance is striking as is the rotunda lobby. 

The gym was a good size and well appointed . The  pool area was large and had a good amount of loungers. The restaurant has a sushi bar as well as traditional table service. The hotel didn't seem crowded and was very quiet.

There's 24 hour room service, a gym, spa, pool, lobby bar with all day dining, restaurant, afternoon tea, a private members club, and event space.  The Tower of London is a short walk away, as is the Tower Hill station.

Room:

Nomad 7

We had a parlor suite @ Nomad. It was 377 square feet with a living room and a separate bedroom. The living room has a couch, armchair, coffee table, tv, armoire with makeup area, minibar/coffee station. The separate bedroom had a desk with a chair as well as a king sized bed. The bathroom was small with a single vanity and shower( rainfall+wand). No tub sadly. 

The water pressure and temperature were great, the Air conditioning worked well, and the furniture and bed was comfy. The linens, towels, and robes were also nice. The bath amenities were nice. The view was of a side street. The finishes were nice, but the bathroom, bedroom, and separate living space all felt small.


Four Seasons Tower Bridge 9

We had a heritage suite @ Four Seasons Tower Bridge. It was 700 square feet with high ceilings. The room was down a hallway that you needed a room key to enter. There were 3 suites in the area. This suite didn't have a separate door to the bedroom, but it did have one to the office space. The living space had a couch, 2 armchairs, a mini bar/coffee station.

There was a king sized bed with a bench, a walk in closet, an office space, and a large bathroom. The bathroom had a double vanity, a stand alone shower(rainfall+wand), and a separate tub. It was one of those showers that gets water everywhere if you use the rainfall head, so put a few towels on the floor. They also had a pass through cabinet next to the door for laundry service.

Water temp and pressure were excellent, the furniture and bed were both comfortable. The linens, towels, and robes were nice. We liked the bath amenities and the general hotel fragrance.The air conditioning worked well. We were on the ground floor so no views. The finishes in the room were nice and the space felt big and comfortable.

Food:

Nomad 9

We had dinner and breakfast in the hotel restaurant, Twenty8. We also had cocktails,  and I had late night snack in the bar, Side Hustle.

Dinner and breakfast were both good. They had nice oysters and ceviche. Salads were good while bone marrow was a miss for us. Chicken Milanese was very nice. Cocktails and wine were good. The menu was a bit small. 

Breakfast was quite nice. The menu had classic breakfast staples as well as healthier options. The breakfast sandwich was a banger. Smoothies, yogurt, fruit, sausage were all good stuff also.

Drinks at Side Hustle were great. They were stiff but still flavorful. The paloma was excellent. They've got a nice selection of spirits. The fish tacos are DYNAMITE. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that they served Mexican food. I intended to have 1 fish taco to give it a go and see. I ended up having 3. 



Four Seasons Tower Bridge 8.5

We had dinner at the hotel restaurant, Mei Ume, breakfast with in room dining, and I had a drink at the lobby bar.

Dinner at Mei Ume was good. They make a good Peking duck. We had multiple plates of sashimi that were also really good. The other apps never came out so I dunno about them. The soup & dessert were kinda a miss for us. The wine, spirits, and saki list were nice.

Breakfast was very good. The menu was large and consistented of breakfast staples along with healthier options. The in room dining menu also had a substantial baby food section.
Eggs, bacon, smoothies, fruit, oatmeal, French toast were all on point. I only had one drink at the lobby bar. The whiskey selection was pretty good.

1nnvlvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nnvlvp/a_community_hub_for_social_anxiety_need_a_reality/,A community hub for social anxiety. Need a reality check & validation plan,"Hey everyone,
‚ÄãI'm looking for some sharp insights and a reality check on a business idea that I'm deeply passionate about but completely stuck on how to start.

‚ÄãThe Situation in a Nutshell:
‚ÄãAssets: My father is a small-scale property developer. I have access to 4 vacant, unused houses ( two are adjacent and can be combined).

‚ÄãThe Problem: They've been empty for years. My attempts to rent them out have failed (lots of inquiries, but everyone ghosts after viewing).

‚ÄãThe Location's Potential: This isn't a dead-end location. It's actually a high-growth area. An influential local figure just built a waterpark next door, and 3 other developers have started projects nearby. This neighborhood is about to get very busy.

‚ÄãThe Idea & My ""Why"":
‚ÄãInspired by a random Reddit comment, and fueled by my own lifelong struggle with social anxiety, I want to turn these houses into a community hub‚Äîa safe space for people to connect offline.

‚ÄãThe business would have four pillars:
‚ÄãAffordable Group Therapy: Partnering with a local psychologist for in-person sessions (I tried online therapy, but the lack of real interaction was a major drawback). 

‚ÄãSocial Club: Hosting activities like board games, workshops, movie nights, book clubs, etc., for the general public.

‚ÄãEnglish Tutoring: Leveraging my English Lit degree to run small classes.

‚ÄãPop-up Caf√©: A small, simple coffee setup to improve the atmosphere and generate extra revenue.

‚ÄãThe Core Dilemma:
‚ÄãI got some great advice: ""Build the community first, not the venue."" Start with free meetups in public parks to see if anyone is even interested. This makes perfect sense, but honestly, I'm terrified and clueless about how to start. As someone with social anxiety and very few friends, being the ""initiator"" feels like an impossible first step. 

‚ÄãHere's Where I Need Your Help:
‚ÄãIdea Validation: How would you test demand for a hyper-local, in-person community hub like this with a budget of virtually $0? How do I find the first 10 people who might be interested?

‚ÄãThe First Tangible Step: What is the absolute smallest, non-scary action I can take this week to move this from an idea to a project? (e.g., post an anonymous survey on a local Facebook group?) 

‚ÄãApproaching Professionals: Any tips on how to frame a partnership proposal for a psychologist? I want it to sound like a solid business opportunity, not just a vague idea.

‚ÄãFunding Model: I'm reluctant to ask my dad for money as his business is struggling. This is a for-profit venture, so crowdfunding feels wrong. Are there any creative funding models for a ""for-profit with a social mission"" business? 

‚ÄãI'm also open to any other ideas for these vacant properties. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

‚ÄãTL;DR: I have 4 empty houses in a promising, up-and-coming area. I want to create a community hub to combat loneliness, but I have social anxiety and no idea how to validate the concept or find the first members. Seeking a practical, step-by-step game plan.

Like, I‚Äôd match and make up the most random stuff just to see if they‚Äôd believe me. I told one guy I was training to be an astronaut. Another that I had a twin sister who swapped dates with me sometimes. My favorite was saying I‚Äôd been scouted for a reality TV show but turned it down ‚Äúfor privacy.‚Äù

It was just dumb fun‚Ä¶ until I actually matched with this one guy. And he was different. Funny, sweet, we vibed instantly. So I kept talking to him, but here‚Äôs the problem - he still thinks all that stuff is real. He legit believes I‚Äôm an astronaut-in-training with a twin who could walk in at any moment, and that Netflix once begged me to be on a dating show.

Fast forward a few months. We‚Äôve been on so many dates, we‚Äôre basically together now.

1nnvcsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1nnvcsy/aita_for_wanting_to_feel_alive_again_even_if_it/,AITA for wanting to feel alive again even if it meant lying to get there?,"My husband caught me at a hotel with my ex last weekend and now my entire family has disowned me.

Three months ago I ran into my college ex at a coffee shop. We dated for four years before I met my husband. The breakup was mutual. We both wanted different things back then. He moved across the country for work and I stayed here.

Seeing him brought back memories. Not just the good times but this feeling of being young and free. We exchanged numbers. Just to catch up, I told myself.

The texts started innocent. ""How's your mom?"" and ""Remember when we drove to the beach at midnight?"" But they got flirtier. He said I was still beautiful. That his biggest regret was letting me go.

I should have stopped responding. I know that now.

Instead I started deleting our conversations. When my husband asked who kept texting me late at night, I said it was my coworker about a project.

One night after too much wine, I told my husband I felt trapped. That I never got to be wild or spontaneous because we got married so young. I actually asked him if he'd give me one weekend. Just one weekend to feel free again.

""Are you serious right now?"" He stared at me like I'd grown a second head.

""Other couples do it. Open marriages are normal now.""

""We're not other couples. And you're talking about your ex. The answer is no.""

He slept on the couch that night. The next morning he acted like nothing happened but I could tell he was watching me. Checking my phone when he thought I wasn't looking.

My ex texted me that Friday. He was in town for business. Just one drink, he said. For old times sake.

I told my husband I was going to my sister's place for the weekend. She lives two hours away and we'd been planning to visit her new house. Perfect cover.

""Have fun with your sister,"" my husband said. But something in his voice felt off.

I met my ex at a hotel bar downtown. One drink turned into three. Then he mentioned he had a room upstairs. Just to talk more privately, he said.

I knew what would happen if I went up there. I went anyway.

Saturday morning I woke up in his bed. My phone had seventeen missed calls. Five from my husband. Twelve from my mom.

Before I could call back, someone pounded on the door. Hard.

""I know you're in there."" My husband's voice. Calm but cold.

My ex grabbed his clothes. ""You said you were separated.""

""I never said that.""

""Then what the hell am I doing here?""

The door pounded again. ""Open up or I'm calling hotel security.""

I opened the door. My husband stood there with printed bank statements in his hand. The hotel charge from my credit card highlighted in yellow.

""Your sister called looking for you. Imagine my surprise when she said you never showed up."" He looked past me to my ex. ""Get dressed and get out.""

My ex grabbed his things and practically ran past us. Coward.

""I can explain.""

""Don't. Pack your stuff. You're leaving.""

""This is my house too.""

""Not anymore. I'm done.""

I thought he was bluffing. He wasn't. When I got home, my things were in boxes by the door. The locks already changed.

But here's where it gets worse. He didn't just kick me out. He drove to my parents' house and told them everything. Showed them the bank statements. The hotel receipt. Even screenshots of my location showing I was never at my sister's house.

My dad wouldn't even look at me when I showed up. My mom, who usually defends me no matter what, just shook her head.

""We raised you better than this,"" she said. ""That man gave you everything and you threw it away for what? A fling?""

""You don't understand. I felt trapped.""

""Then you talk to your husband. You go to counseling. You don't lie and cheat."" She actually started crying. ""I'm ashamed to call you my daughter right now.""

She told me to leave. My own mother.

My sister won't return my calls. My brother texted saying I'm not welcome at his house either. My husband filed for divorce three days later.

My best friend is letting me crash on her couch but even she says I messed up. That asking for a hall pass was bad enough but going behind his back was unforgivable.

The ex? He blocked my number the next day.

I lost everything for one night. My marriage. My family. My home. And the worst part is everyone acts like I'm some kind of monster. Like I'm the first person to ever make a mistake or feel suffocated in their marriage.

My mom called yesterday. Not to reconcile but to tell me they're paying for my husband's lawyer. They're helping him divorce me. My own parents.

""He's the son we never had,"" she said. ""You're the one who broke your vows.""

AITA for wanting to feel alive again even if it meant lying to get there?

Waking up on a Tuesday morning, still half-asleep, and stumbling into *that* bathroom was lowkey the ultimate vibe kill. The sink looked like a science experiment gone wrong, and don't even get me started on the shower drain. NGL, I'm pretty chill, but the bathroom was consistently the house's Achilles' heel, and I was at my breaking point. We‚Äôd tried chore charts before, but they always ended up looking like ancient hieroglyphs no one bothered to decipher.

I slumped back into my room, coffee still brewing, feeling that familiar knot of frustration tighten in my stomach. Maya, our resident clean freak, always did her part, but even she was starting to get passive-aggressive with her meticulously placed ""cleaning supplies"" on the counter. Sam, bless his chaotic heart, seemed genuinely oblivious to the concept of a shared space needing, you know, *cleaning*. And Chloe, our quiet, artistic soul, was usually holed up in her room, a benevolent observer to the domestic chaos.

This time, I didn't want to just write another ignored note. I wanted to actually fix it. So, that evening, after Sam almost slipped on a damp towel left on the floor, I just‚Ä¶ blurted it out. ""Okay, we need to talk about the bathroom. Seriously."" Sam looked up from his phone, startled. Maya, who had just walked in, gave a knowing, exasperated sigh. Chloe, ever subtle, just raised an eyebrow.

""Look,"" I said, trying to keep my voice even, ""I get we're all busy, but it's gotten pretty gnarly in there. It's not fair to Maya, and honestly, it's stressing me out."" Maya chimed in, ""Yeah, I literally cleaned it last week, and it lasted two days before the hairball monster returned."" Sam mumbled an apology, looking genuinely sheepish. ""My bad, guys, I honestly just‚Ä¶ forget. Like, out of sight, out of mind.""

Then, Chloe, in her soft voice, piped up. ""What if we try a cleaning rotation, but use one of those apps? Like, it sends reminders, and you can check off when it's done. And maybe we do a house dinner once a month? So we actually, like, hang out more?"" It was a simple suggestion, but it was so valid. We all looked at each other, and a collective tension seemed to dissipate. Sam immediately downloaded an app on his phone, ""Bet, I'm down for that. And a house dinner sounds kinda fun, not gonna lie.""

Over the next few weeks, the app actually worked. The bathroom, while not spotless 24/7, was consistently cleaner. But it was the house dinners that really changed things. We started cooking together, sharing stories, and laughing until our sides hurt. We weren't just roommates anymore; we were actually friends. Seeing Sam try to cook risotto for the first time, or hearing Chloe tell a wild story about her art studio, made all the initial frustrations feel so small. I realized that sometimes, the biggest issues aren't about the mess itself, but about just needing to talk, and then finding a way to connect.

I still remember coming home from work and seeing that first sunbeam hitting the living room floor. It should have been a nice moment, but all I could see was a fresh layer of dog hair dancing in the light, like a tiny, frustrating snow globe. It felt like no matter how many times I ran the broom, it was a pointless battle against a never-ending supply of fluff.



It was my friend Sam who finally cracked it. I was complaining about it over coffee, and she just smiled and said her floors used to look the same until recently. She has two cats, so her place was basically a fur factory. But that day, her floors were actually clean. I noticed it right away. I asked her what her secret was, half-expecting some elaborate new cleaning ritual.



She laughed and said it wasn't a secret, just a little helper that runs for about an hour while she's at work. She described it as a tiny, quiet roommate whose only job is to patrol for crumbs and pet hair. The best part, she said, was coming home to clean floors without having even thought about it. It just handles the daily grind so the weekend cleaning feels less overwhelming.



It made me think about how we get used to certain chores, just accepting them as a fixed part of life. You vacuum because the floor is dirty, and then it gets dirty again. But what if something could interrupt that cycle on the days you're just too busy? The idea isn't about never cleaning again; it's about reclaiming those small pockets of time.



Now, I finally understand that feeling. That little hum in the background means I can actually enjoy that sunbeam on the floor instead of seeing it as a spotlight on my chores. It‚Äôs one less thing to worry about, and some days, that makes all the difference.

1nnv91r,https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1nnv91r/how_parking_minimums_squander_houstons_potential/,How Parking Minimums Squander Houston's Potential for Dense Walkability.,"***Introduction***

It may be the concrete jungle of car-dependent sprawl as far as the eye can see. Or the multi-lane freeways carving up valuable acres of urban real estate. Regardless, the built-environment across the Houston area bears a lot in terms of aesthetic and lifestyle complaints. Yet, what is less appreciated as that such outcomes are merely symptoms of¬†*the invisible codes that govern Houston's current state of affairs. And parking minimums are, perhaps, the most detrimental of them.*

¬†

***How Parking Minimums Squander Houston's Potential***

1. Think of a restaurant, coffee shop, or any local business trying to open in Houston. In order to do so, [according to Houston's code,](https://library.municode.com/tx/houston/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=COOR_CH26PA_ARTVIIIOREPALO_DIV2REPASPBISP_S26-491FRRE) the prospective businesses are forced to acquire much more land in order to build the necessary surface lots and/or parking garages. For instance, a restaurant would require 10 spaces per 1000 sqft of building area, while a bar would require 14 spaces per 1000 sqft of building area. This combined land and infrastructure cost significantly raises barrier for entry, stifles out many infill options (especially within the increasingly built-out Inner Loop), leads to destruction of historic buildings, as well as magnifies overhead for businesses that do get to operate.
2. Given the greater overhead and costs, demand across the area has to be higher in order to justify business operations. This reduces the amount of amenities per Capita, contributed to dead streetscapes and lack of perceived interests across various neighborhoods.
3. With demand across the area for existing businesses, this leads to customers coming in from outside the neighborhood. Often arriving by car. Hence, neighborhood commercial activity is associated with noise and traffic, as opposed to lively vibrancy. Perhaps a major factor in the NIMBYism that we see.
4. Another problem with parking minimums stems from [a lack of incrementalism, favoring coarse-grained developments.](https://andrewalexanderprice.com/blog20151021.php) The coarse-grained developments have been the predominant type of infill across the country, and they have problems of being overall more expensive for development, less diversity of ownership, less amenities in walking distance, as well as less resilience to bad outcomes (e.g. aesthetics, vacancies, etc). The space taken up by these developments (often block-filling) leads to a lot of bypassed infill opportunity. This leads to persistent vacancies and abandoned lots, even in supposedly thriving neighborhoods like Montrose.
5. All of these problems apply for residential developments as well. With more land and infrastructure costs of development, many infill options have to be passed over. And then the buildings constructed are often ""Texas Donut"" 5/1s or parking garage podiums, limiting the ease at which a denser, more urban core can be built. Imagine how much cheaper and faster densification could occur if, say, small-lot ""single-stair"" apartments, multiple units each floor, were legal to construct in Houston?
6. And it's a self-fulfilling prophecy!
   1. Houstonians need their cars because things are spread out.
   2. Things are spread out because of the minimum parking laws in place.
   3. The minimum parking laws are in place because Houstonians need their cars!

¬†

***An ""Ideal"" Visual Representation***

Below is an example of a mixed-use ""courtyard block"" apartment building from a European city. Notice the shops on the bottom, with apartments on top. Additionally, notice the types of shops present, how they encompass categories like clothing stores, tea shops, laundromats, vitamin/supplement stores, etc. *All of these same amenities exist in Houston.* It's just that, given the combined parking minimums and front setback minimums, the amenities would occur in the form of ""ugly strip malls and big-box stores."" Even for denser apartment areas like Gulfton or Midtown, the overall space dedicated to cars and parking limits the amount of area that could otherwise be given to active ground-level shops, stores, and other activity generating developments.

¬†

***Lack of Zoning?*** 

Contrary to popular belief, Houston's ""lack of zoning"" was never the problem in terms of dense and walkable ideals (as depicted in the image above). With no mandated separation of uses, the mixed-use developments are legal across the city. We can confirm this by looking at this history of zoning, and how the first ordinances across the nation were implemented well after much of the nation's historic neighborhoods (e.g. French Quarter, Beacon Hill, etc) were constructed.

As mentioned before, the actual problems within Houston stem from lingering regulations like parking minimums which perpetuate the single-use ""strip mall"" commercial form.

¬†¬†

***How to Fix the Issue?***

As usual, city council holds the power to change these laws, given that they ultimately conduct the votes that affect the ordinances. We saw this in 2019, when city council voted in favor to eliminate parking minimums for both East Downtown and (much of) Midtown. Elsewhere across the nation, we are seeing the impact of councilmembers, such as with Los Angeles on recent upzoning bills along their transit stations. Hence, people in Houston need to demand more and [contact their city council member](https://www.houstontx.gov/council/) in order to incite true change.

¬†

***Anything Else?***

Similar problems also emerge from the other lingering laws still in Houston's code. These include lot size minimums, setback minimums, buffering ordinances, stipulations regarding residential-commercial standards, deed-restrictions, etc. Personally, I think that parking minimums are the most detrimental of all the lingering regulations still within Houston's code, given the widespread, one-size fits all coverage across the city, combined with added infrastructure and perpetuated car-dependency. But, ideally, all of the useless codes need to be wiped out in order to allow ideal, dense and walkable development within Houston.

¬†

***Conclusion***

For ages, Houston has been disregarded as a ""work camp."" That everything was simply work, family, and cheap cost of living, with no stories to be told, memories to be formed, fun experiences to be had, hobbies to be enjoyed, and other such sentiments. This was the truth, a ""fact of the universe"" that everyone was prescribed to agree with. 

Those sentiments send a clear message: that the people living here do not matter, and that their experiences are worth discarding. And it's likely through this void that fascists like Greg Abbott seized power, using it to deliberately compromise quality for Houston and Harris County.

The more that I've learned reading through the policy resources, *the more I've realized that it doesn't have to be this way.* As demonstrated with this Reddit Post, *the perceived outcomes are entirely by design. And citizens should be empowered to use their agency, and right the wrongs of the past.* 

Ultimately, I think we spend too much time worrying about what Houston is or isn't. Instead, I prefer a different, more aspirational approach in pushing for what Houston *can be.* And elimination of parking minimums would be one significant step forward.

That passion is actually why I started my own project around Panamanian specialty coffee.

For me, the best part isn‚Äôt only drinking it, but the little ritual of preparing it: grinding, brewing, smelling, waiting. That moment sets the tone for my day. Because of that, I‚Äôve started treating coffee kind of like wine. I look at origin, variety, process, and it feels like choosing a bottle for a special dinner.

1nnuzqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatnotapp/comments/1nnuzqi/lets_talk_giveaways_good_and_the_bad/,Let's talk giveaways. Good and the bad.,Well if you are a seller or buyer on WhatNot. You know abouts the givvy's.  Giveaways from what I understand are a way for sellers to gain or refrain buyers. They can range from stickers up to really nice items or even monetary items such as gift cards Amazon to Starbucks. The issue is some don't like the givvy and leave bad reviews. Which is wrong if its stated what the givvy is and you still entered it. Which most givvys state what is being given. If it doesn't just know its not going to be a big deal as why they post what the givvy is. Mostly could be eye mask or stickers. I can see the concept of why Whatnot allowed the givvy system.  Now here's the problem. Some of the sellers are now not wanting to honor what they post as a givvy or what they state the givvy is. Now we are all aware their are the goblins. As it would be ANYWHERE something is being given away free. But if you are a seller. Why post a item that you dont intend on sending or cant send. Case in point. I am by no way a goblin. I've spent thousands on WN in the short time I been on the app. Probably like 5 months now. Of course you cannot purchase from every seller. But if I stop by your show and you have a givvy running and I follow. Because you cannot get givvy's if you don't. Im going to join because why not while I check out what you have to offer. I may buy or I may stay and check it out then come back another time and buy. Now if I hit the givvy while there. It is exciting to win anything. But im starting to notice that sellers are not wanting to send what it is they are giving away. My own experience. One seller said he was matching a sponsored givvy. His words not mine. Only to not do it and said the givvy its self was worth double (beauty show). Another stated they were giving away BIE labubu's.  Received another type doll. Grateful. But its still not what was stated. (Wheelgame labubu show). Yet another was giving away earbuds. Received coffee (sunnies show). So either they don't have these items or decided you are not worthy of the items. So to me this system is dead if sellers are cherry picking who gets what. If you are going to do that. Just run buyer givvy's or wait on sponsored givvy's so you as a seller are not out of something. I don't agree with bad reviewing a givvy. As its a free item. But I don't agree with sellers that run them then don't or cant send what's been offered. Thoughts ? This thread is not about the goblins. They are a whole other conversation. ,0,1758566884.0,whatnotapp,2,0.4,False

Earth, August 24, 2115.

Exactly 18 years and 25 days had passed since Battle Group ""Arrow"" left Earth's orbit. Now, it had returned after a victorious battle.

The office of the Grand Admiral of the Guard, Marcus Thorne, was the embodiment of the new world. It was devoid of luxuries or art. The only adornment in the ascetic, metal room was a gigantic, holographic tactical map of the Solar System, gleaming with thousands of icons symbolizing ships, defense stations, and military outposts. This was the altar before which Thorne worshipped his one and only god: power.

Rear Admiral Volkov, still in his worn, battle-scarred uniform, stood in the middle of the office. His face was purple with rage, and the tension around him almost crackled in the sterile air. He had just left the deck of his legendary ""Ivan the Terrible,"" and instead of pride, he felt only a burning anger.

""Damn it, Marcus! I turn on the television to see what home looks like, and I see propaganda like something out of North Korea!"" his voice, accustomed to barking orders over the roar of cannons, now trembled with fury. ""It‚Äôs a theater! Some puffed-up peacock, Alistair Finch, and that fanatic Vance, talking about 'sacred scars' and 'genetic destiny'! What have you done to this world?! What has your government done?!""

Thorne stood in silence at the map's control console, his back to Volkov. His posture was rigid, almost motionless, as if he were suppressing every reaction by sheer force of will.

""Have you lost your fucking mind?!"" Volkov continued, stepping closer. Each footstep echoed in the tomb-like silence. ""I have the perspective of someone who said goodbye to a halfway normal world! There were disputes, politics, but there was freedom! And I've returned to some totalitarian nightmare where children recite war doctrines on the streets! My people‚Ä¶ my officers, who fought and bled for nearly two decades, are looking at all this and they don't understand. We fought for Earth, not for this‚Ä¶ this labor camp on steroids!""

Thorne finally turned around slowly. His face looked older, despite the nanites. It was not how Volkov remembered it; it was marked not by age, but by the terrible weight of decisions.

""I know, Volkov‚Ä¶ I know,"" he said quietly, his voice devoid of arrogance, filled only with a bottomless exhaustion. ""Do you think this is what I wanted? I had to. I had to accelerate the fleet's construction. I had to increase productivity by a thousand percent. I had to silence the malcontents and traitors of Earth‚Ä¶""

""Thorne! What the hell are you talking about?! We won the civil war against the loyalists! There were no traitors!""

""Weren't there?"" Thorne raised an eyebrow. ""Yes, we defeated their armies. But ideas are more durable than armor. After the first five-year plans, after the drastic lowering of living standards for the entire population and the complete transformation of the economy to a war footing, discontent arose. Riots in the factories. Sabotage. People wanted their comforts back, their TV shows and cheap food, while the axe of the Plague hung over us. I had to stifle it. I had to give them a new enemy and a new religion. That religion became the Guard, and the propaganda you so despise became its gospel.""

Marcus walked over to the immense map and pointed to the icon of Earth.

""Look. Down there, in the factories and mines, they didn't see what we saw. They didn't feel the threat. I had to make them feel it in their bones. Every single day.""

""So you broke them. You intimidated them. You took everything from them in the name of security,"" Volkov snarled, his voice laced with pure contempt.

""Yes. And in return, I gave them a purpose. And I gave them the tools to achieve that purpose."" Thorne waved his hand, and the map flared with new light. Thousands of warship icons around Earth, Mars, and Jupiter lit up in green. Volkov stared at the sight, feeling a mixture of disgust and involuntary admiration for the sheer scale of the undertaking. ""But I can loosen the reins now, Volkov. I no longer need to hold them by the throat.""

He looked his soldier straight in the eye.

""Over these years, we have built thousands of ships. We have dozens of listening posts, rings of defensive satellites. There is a fully self-sufficient military colony on Mars, and a long-range sensor base on Pluto that will give us years of warning before an attack. I have achieved the first objective. I have made it so that we will no longer be a defenseless, easy target for the Plague.""

He paused, his voice softening slightly, taking on an almost visionary tone.

""And now for the second objective. The one I never forgot. The worlds the swarm spoke of. Remember? The low-oxygen worlds with intelligent civilizations that possess culture. But they lack the ability to develop technology. The Plague still hunts them.""

""Habitat 1,"" Volkov whispered, recalling the global vote, the referendum from forty-four years ago.

""Exactly. Listen, Volkov‚Ä¶ I made this happen. We now have so many ships and people that we can send a powerful expedition to Habitat 1 and simultaneously defend Earth effectively from two different directions. This is no longer a dream. It is an operational plan.""

Thorne pointed to a distant sector of the map, where a single, lonely marker pulsed.

""In less than three years, the 3rd Fleet of the Guard for the Defense of the Seven Worlds will depart from here. Four hundred state-of-the-art ships, including dozens of 'Thor'-class battleships and 'Hegemon'-class carriers. Their sole mission will be to find and protect the civilizations of Habitat 1 from a potential attack. The 1st and 2nd Fleets will remain in our system, fully prepared to repel anyone who dares to venture here.""

Volkov remained silent, stunned by the scale of what he was hearing. He hated the methods, but the result‚Ä¶ the result was undeniable.

""Understand, old friend,"" Thorne finished, a note of pleading in his voice. ""I had to use these totalitarian methods to give us a future. To give a future to those seven worlds. But that stage is ending. Now, I will loosen the reins. We will increase freedoms, reduce the required industrial quotas. We will let people breathe. The world will return to a relative norm, I promise. And their standard of living will rise. We have achieved the impossible, and now it is time for humanity to start benefiting from it.""

Volkov still stared at the sea of green icons on the map. He felt revulsion for the path Thorne had taken. But he also saw the goal it had led to. A goal he himself considered noble. Could monstrous means be nullified by a sublime end? He didn't know the answer. He only knew that the victory he had brought home was far more complicated than he had ever imagined.

""Thorne!"" Volkov shouted. ""I'm holding you to your word!""

He turned and walked out without even saluting.

Upon his return, Kael called Blanka, wanting to arrange the coffee they had promised each other at their favorite place.

She didn't answer. Devastated, he sat in the barracks of the 9th Guard Brigade, holding his head in his hands. Questions swirled in his mind, each more painful than the last. Is she dead? Does she not want to know me, did she change her number? Eighteen years had passed, after all.

Suddenly, a text message appeared on his smartphone.

He read it, and his heart pounded.

Hi Kael. I'm so glad you survived.

Kael called again. The call was rejected.

Don't call. If this is about our coffee, we're not meeting.

He replied, feeling a growing chill. Why?

My dear Kael, I'm 60 now. You, in your thousand-year body, look exactly as I remember you.

Kael answered, ignoring the pain her words caused him.

I don't care about that. I want to talk to you in person.

Understand, Kael, I'm ashamed. Can't you understand that?

I can, Blanka, but please, understand me. I want to know how your 18 years have been.

They met a dozen hours later. Kael had been waiting for fifteen minutes. Their favorite spot was gone; a factory and an industrial city, stark and alien, had risen in its place.

Suddenly, he heard his name. ""Kael.""

He turned. He recognized her immediately, despite her age. She was still a beautiful woman. Her makeup was flawless, a careful mask meant to hide the passage of time. She was holding two paper coffee cups.

He wanted to hug her, but she pulled back, creating an invisible barrier between them.

""I want to tell you that I have a husband, Kael. I met him three years after you left. I adopted his children, two sons. They treat me like their mother. I never thought I'd be a good mother. I've been happy all these years. You don't have to worry.""

Kael listened, then summed up his years on the ship in a few sentences. The words sounded empty when contrasted with her story of a real life.

""I'm glad your life turned out well,"" he said, forcing a smile.

As they said their goodbyes, he grabbed her like he used to in the old days and kissed her passionately. It was a gesture of desperation, an attempt to reclaim something that had long since died.

""Blanka, I will always remember you and love you. The war and the Guard separated us.""

The empty paper cup, crushed in his hand, was the only tangible proof that his meeting with Blanka wasn't just a dream. Kael stood alone in the shadow of the factory that had consumed his past, feeling more alien than he had on Proxima b, where he had fought. He had lost the future he had dreamed of. Now, only one thing remained‚Äîan anchor. The past. Family.

He summoned an autonomous taxi and gave an address he knew by heart. The journey through the city was like a ride through an alien civilization. Instead of colorful, vibrant streets, he saw stark, monumental structures of metal and concrete. Black and gray dominated everything, broken only by the sharp, red glow of the omnipresent symbols of the Guard. Huge holographic screens displayed soldiers marching in endless loops, industrial production statistics, and the face of Grand Admiral Marcus Thorne‚Äîthe uncle who had condemned him to this abyss of time. Everywhere, there were reminders of the mission assigned to them by the swarm.

The people on the streets moved in an organized, almost synchronized manner. Their faces were expressionless, focused on their purpose, as if the entire city were one vast garrison. Kael felt a shiver. This was the world his uncle had built. The world he himself had shed blood for. A world he didn't understand at all, one that filled him with revulsion.

His parents' apartment building still stood in the same place, but it was now surrounded by a three-meter-high wall. A golden cage for the regime's scientific elite, he thought. After passing through several checkpoints that easily recognized his military ID, every guard knew he had returned from Proxima. They saluted him sharply, even though they held higher ranks. At last, he stood before the familiar door. He took a deep, shuddering breath and pressed the bell.

The door opened silently. Lyra stood in the doorway.

For a moment, they froze. They looked at each other, two people frozen in time while the world around them had gone mad. She was exactly as he remembered her‚Äîher face was still that of a twenty-six-year-old, her eyes holding the same quiet strength. But now, in that gaze, Kael also saw something new‚Äîthe shadow of eighteen years of struggle, loss, and the cosmic void.

They didn't need words. They threw themselves into each other's arms. It wasn't a tender, familial hug. It was the collision of two armored hulls that had survived the same storm‚Äîa hard, desperate embrace from someone who was the only other person who could possibly understand.

As they pulled apart, a man emerged from behind her. He was slim, but Kael instantly recognized the posture of a sniper‚Äîabsolute stillness and economy of motion. His face was absurdly young, smooth like a teenager's.

""Kael, this is Jimmi. My spotter,"" Lyra said quietly. ""And my partner.""

Jimmi extended a hand. His grip was firm and strong. ""Good to finally meet you, Corporal. In private, without the act. Lyra told me a lot about you.""

On the transport ship, Jimmi had never had much of a connection with Kael.

""Kael,"" he corrected, returning the handshake. He looked at his sister, then at Jimmi, who looked like he had just graduated from high school. Their shared service and the journey back had bonded them. They had become a couple with a thousand years ahead of them. How did I not guess‚Ä¶ her and Jimmi, always together, he laughed inwardly. Kael felt a strange pang of joy‚Äîat least she hadn't returned to this new reality alone.

Then, from the depths of the hallway, their father appeared. Aris Thorne. He, too, looked almost the same, protected by nanites, but his hair had grayed at the temples, and his face was marked by a deep, unspoken sadness. There was no joy in his eyes at the sight of his son's return. There was only pain.

The apartment was silent. Too silent. Kael remembered it as a place full of his mother's laughter, the smell of her cooking, the music she listened to. Now, a sterile, museum-like silence reigned.

""Where's Mom?"" Kael asked immediately, his voice sounding foreign in the funereal atmosphere.

Aris looked at him, his eyes glazing over with tears he could no longer hold back. Lyra placed a hand on Jimmi's shoulder as if for support.

""Son‚Ä¶"" Aris began, his voice breaking. ""Your mother‚Ä¶ Elara‚Ä¶ she always believed in progress. That science was our only path forward. She supported Marcus‚Ä¶ she supported this entire war effort because she believed it was necessary.""

""Dad, what happened? Where is she?"" Kael felt a cold ice fill his veins.

""She died. Six years ago,"" Aris answered softly. ""There was an accident. She was working as the lead physicist on the assembly of a new fusion reactor for a defense station's weapon in lunar orbit. She wanted to personally supervise the final tests. There was an uncontrolled plasma burst‚Ä¶""

""What? How? She was supposed to live for a thousand years thanks to the nanites!"" Kael shouted, his voice echoing off the empty walls.

Aris shook his head, a single tear tracing a path down his cheek.

""Even nanites can't reassemble a person from atoms when they've been torn apart by the energy of a star. There was nothing left of her, Kael. Nothing. That was the price of progress. A terrible, monstrous price.""

Kael's world shattered. In that single moment, he understood everything‚Äîthe emptiness in his father's eyes, his sister's sorrow, the tomb-like silence of this home. This wasn't a home. It was a mausoleum.

In an instant, he had lost everything. The woman who was his future. And the mother who was his past.

His strength deserted him completely. His legs buckled, and he fell to his knees, a choked, pain-filled sob tearing from his throat. He cried for Blanka. He cried for his mother. He cried for the old world that was gone forever and for the boy he used to be, who had set off for war full of hope, only to return to ruins.

Lyra came and knelt beside him, holding him tightly. His father placed a trembling hand on his head. Three survivors, adrift in an ocean of loss, trying to comfort one another, even though they knew there was no comfort to be had.

* \[ADDRESSED\] Please let us switch between multiple ability wheels ! With all the new abilities it is very annoying to have to constantly switch our abilities‚Ä¶
* \[ADDRESSED\] Please let us enter the realms while on the home island.
* In construction mode: please add a **clickable** undo button for PC. Ctrl+z does not work on my PC because I‚Äôm using an AZERTY keyboard. Please add a button that we can click on directly on the screen.
* The house system and new abilities desperately need better tutorials. It took me forever to understand that we had to groom animal before using the ‚Äúanimal inviting‚Äù ability. Same thing for raising hearts/affinity with invited animals. It is not explained. It‚Äôs also not explained that we had to use our fishing ability to catch the fish from our pond, not the fish keeping outfit.
* Please add a ‚ÄúHousing Fufu‚Äù in the realms of nourishment. We can max every other insight with fufus, but not home insight, why is that ?
* In construction mode: Please give us the option to hide Nikki in construction mode (same button that we have in camera mode). Nikki gets in the way and blocks the view, making it really hard to place furniture and structures properly. Especially with the gliding ability fusion, the big blue flower takes up half of the screen. Or please give us a bird‚Äôs eyes View Mode, like in the Sims !
* In construction mode: Please add the option to show grid. Right now it is hard to make anything symmetrical, without a visible grid.
* In construction mode: If we have multiple of an item on the hotbar, after placing one, you shouldn't have to re-select the item to place another.
* In construction mode: please add a gizmo tool, that lets us move the item how we want on the XYZ axis. It could be the exact same tool we have to move Momo around in camera mode, but for furniture (like in Planet zoo and Planet coaster) !
* In construction mode: Please let us dye items without picking them up.
* In construction mode: Please add better descriptions of the settings menu (how and when to use the settings for floating, clipping, snapping‚Ä¶)
* Basic construction pieces like walls, foundations and ceilings should be cheaper and faster to craft.
* Please add more house presets, right now there‚Äôs only one (the default house). We need more houses types, like small one room houses, big mansions, etc.
* I would like to have another album/social media feature like the color lookbook, but for house photos.
* I like the furniture sketch catalog a lot ! Please add more catalogs with different styles, especially with furniture and decor from the wishing woods, serenity island (crystals and baths), Timis‚Äô makeup lab, the aquariums from the fish seller, the insect houses and cages from the insect guild, and Danqing island ! Please also add a ‚Äúflora‚Äù catalog, to let us collect and craft all the different kinds of plants and trees from the overworld : lavender bushes from Stonevile, bamboo from Danqing island, sunflowers from the abandoned district, the big roses garlands from the bullquet area‚Ä¶
* Please add more dye colors for walls, especially a plain white wall.
* Please make furniture dye less expensive.
* Crafting furniture and construction item should make more use of open world resources ! Why do I have to grow new flowers to build foundations blocks, when I already have thousands of daisies ? There should be at least a few pieces of furniture that we can craft with open world materials only, even if they take a lot of materials, even if they take a long time to craft.
* I would like Nikki to to be able to interact with small items : read books, take a nap on her bed, drink coffee, etc.
* I would like to have a glass showcase where I can display all the Eurekas that I have, and see what colors I am missing from each set.
* Please give us different skins/appearances for the animal lodges. There‚Äôs only one appearance, the big tree stump, which does not fit with the style of the house. I would like more diverse styles, like a regular looking barn for example. The same way, please give us different skins/appearances for the fish ponds, especially a more natural, less square shapes.
* I wish animals could wander further away from their lodge. Right now they seem a bit stuck to it.
* Please add some aquariums to let us display our fish. There are some aquarium models in the fish seller (Karpa) stand in Florawish that would look great ! They could be part of a new photo sketch catalog.
* Please let us access home related menus (house abilities level up and home journal for example) from Pearpal, instead of having to talk to Posy. Posy should only be used as a merchant, to buy and sell stuff.
* Please let us place down our bikes, motorcycle and other rideables permanently as a decoration, and bring other decorations like the bean bag chairs, cauldron, and the bathtub in as decor.
* Please let us put the paintings from the observers society in our house.
* Please add a Momo sized mannequin, to display his cloaks

1nnuw8e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nnuw8e,Fun project: low pressure water line in my kitchen for float valves in my coffee maker and fridge water dispenser.,"Something a bit different. I decided to add a really low pressure water line teeing off my kitchen sink tap so that I could run really thin flexible tubing into my coffee maker which with the help of a small float valve and a bit of 3D printing means it never needs to be filled up manually again! I managed to run it through an absolutely tiny gap at the back of the countertops so no drilling required at all, and it's barely visible. Machine is a Nespresso virtuo.

Then I thought why not branch off that line and snake it into my fridge for a permanent chilled water dispenser, and sure enough it's worked a treat. It was even doable without having to drill through the fridge wall or remove any of the door insulation as the tube compresses flush enough to still let a slow trickle of water in, while also not compromising the fridge seal very much (verified that with a thermal camera, see image. Thanks thermal master for sending me a p3, on an unrelated note. Great bit of kit!) had to use a bit of white tape to cover the line but you really wouldn't see it unless you were looking for it.

Next up on the list is a permanently filling robot mopping station installed under one of the units when I get round to it.

My boyfriend and I went in for breakfast and ordered the beef tapa overload and the Hungarian overload (both in the photo). Portions were huge and really satisfying, exactly what we were craving for a hearty start to the day. The food came out pretty fast too, which was nice since we were already starving.
The beef tapa was flavorful and tender, paired perfectly with rice, eggs, and hashbrown. The Hungarian sausage plate was just as good, smoky and filling. Both were worth the price in my opinion because you get generous servings that will definitely keep you full.

The staff was very accommodating and friendly, which made the whole experience feel welcoming. The place itself has a nice ambiance, cozy and aesthetic without being over the top. Parking is available, which is always a plus in Cebu.

We also ordered iced americano (115) and iced caramel latte (145) to go with breakfast. Those were just okay for me, not bad but I have had better coffee elsewhere. Still, the food made up for it.

Overall, Anthony‚Äôs Guadalupe is a solid spot if you are looking for big breakfast plates in Cebu City. We left full and happy. Definitely planning to come back and try their other meals.

She was my maid of honour, we went on holidays, did road trips, she helped me get together with my now husband.  

When we had a child she would drive up (she lived a few hours away) to see us occasionally, babysit so we could go out. But with this being our first kid we were pretty exhausted, financially destroyed, and just general being new parents. 

Overtime comms reduced, then I found she'd visit our area of the country, not mention at all she was in the area so I'd find out via FB. First time, its fine, figured she was busy, we're not her only friends etc. It happened 3-4  times more and she just stopped talking to us. 

I'll admit, we didn't get down to her area of the country, but again, young child, lack of money, but I guess that's no excuse. I was honestly devastated as we'd been friends for so long, I just had a big cry with my husband. 

She's occasionally messaged off the cuff but its been slap dash/when shes had a few to drink and remembers some random reference. 

Ten years later, we live much nearer to her. I text her saying, would be good to get a coffee sometime, I could meet her half way so it's easy for both of us (we're an hour away or similar). Get a thumbs up in response. 

Shes just got married and while I wasn't expecting an invite as its been so long since we've properly caught up, its that final aspect of, that friendship is done. 

It just makes me feel like I've done something to screw this up, and I dont know what. Once upon a time she was my closest friend, she was my kids honorary aunt, and now there's nothing there.

As I described in this [Trip Plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/KetamineStateYoga/comments/1nkkm4w/trip_plan_a_tantric_practice_to_deal_with_anger/), I have been determined to engage with Anger. This is one of Tibetan Yoga's ""3 Poisons"" (along with Desire and Ignorance). I have seen this red-hot, painful emotion wreak havoc on my body over the years, spreading karmic pain into relationships and life path.

The traditional yogic approach would be to ""purify"" it. To focus, through awareness practices of body, breath, and mind, on allowing it to dissolve. This is effective but very gradual. Quicker results may come for some practitioners on the tantric path. But it's risky, especially if the practitioner is not ready or the understanding is corrupt.

This trip, one of the most beautiful in my memory, showed me both the efficiency of tantric practice and the perils.

**""This is a dream.""**

When you say it within a nighttime (usually REM) dream, you enter a ""lucid"" dream. This is the first step of Tibetan Dream Yoga, ""apprehending"" the dream state.

But what if you say it when you're in the ""waking state""?

**""This anger is a dream.""**

It is very hard to express this in words. When you become lucid in a nighttime dream, there is this sense of opening. Can I be open to the painful contractions in belly, heart, throat when anger courses through the body ‚Äì can I notice and accept their dream-like nature? I find that reminding myself, ""This too shall pass,"" provides motivation to stay with the practice.

So I had been practicing Dream Yoga for several weeks now, once in a while saying, ""This is a dream,"" when I looked at a cloud or tree or building or group of people. And in advance of this ketamine journey, I resolved to give special time to anger (cultivating it with thoughts, allowing it to arise in the body) for personal therapeutic reasons.

**The Night Before**

The dream was not lucid but it was vivid and left a strong impression. My deceased friend and former student Ben was in it, and in the dream I did not realize he died about seven years ago.

Ben was the one who gave me the medical ketamine that started the Psychedelic Yogi phase of my life. [The full story is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KetamineStateYoga/comments/1nn66bh/the_unplanned_peak_ketamine_experience_that_began/) He inspired me in so many ways I will never forget. I said to my partner, ""Ben is the guardian angel of my ketamine trips now.""

In this dream last night, Ben and I were in a room with some other people. He was healthy and animated. At some point the band started playing a song. Ben and I looked at each other ‚Äì Were these chords familiar, this melody?

I started mouthing the words of the Beatles' ""Let it Be."" When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me‚Ä¶

At some point Ben (and I think his father too) realized I was right ‚Äì that the band's song was indistinguishable from ""Let it Be."" We all started singing it together. Let it be, let it be, let it be‚Ä¶

Needless to say, I felt this was an auspicious dream the night before an important ketamine journey where I'd be dealing with tough challenges given the intention I described above. After all, that's another way of expressing the tantric relationship to anger (or any aspect of reality) ‚Äì Let it be.

**Morning and Come-Up**

I awoke at 7. There was a 2-hour wakeful period ending at about 4:00am, during which I performed the Dream Yoga practice of visualizing the letter A and feeling an opening in the throat as I whisper ""Ah"" exhaling. This is probably why I had such vivid dreams afterwards, culminating in the beautiful dream where I got to sing ""Let it Be"" with my deceased friend. I took the dog out.

I had coffee, with no sugar but instead butter and coconut oil ‚Äì this is a method known as ""bulletproofing"" that in theory spreads out the benefits of caffeine over time, thus making them smoother and less intense. I admit I blamed an edgy feeling that persisted well into the come-up on the caffeine, made a note to lower my dependency on it. It was simply to avoid withdrawal, not because I was consciously intending to bring the effects of caffeine into the trip.

I set up my room. As dark as possible (so even the appliance lights covered up). Brown noise on a bluetooth speaker. Water bottle nearby. Cannabis vape nearby. Ketamine lozenges. I sit on my meditation cushion and begin.

It's fast this time, probably due to it being so early in the morning and not having eaten. I feel a bit on edge so I perform a certain pranayama, as I hold the medicine in my mouth, breathing through my nose and then holding my breath with empty lungs. I hold my breath until I can feel the instinctual sense of panic, of primal fear, then inhale deeply ‚Äì as the air surges into the body, the fear dissolves and the body lets go a bit more. Every time I perform this pranayama, my energy becomes more balanced, anxiety transforms to confidence.

I touched in with the emotion of anger a few times on the come-up, sparking it with a particular memory, watching it arise in my body. ""This anger is a dream."" At some point I was whisked away ‚Äì It's always surprising to me, even with RDTs, that one minute you're not feeling anything, the next minute reality is in shards. When I came back into my sense of embodiment and language returned, I nodded gratitude, though I felt like I'd been through Hell, and said, ""message received.""

Because it wasn't just anger. There were all its ugly cousins like shame, fear, hatred, cunning manipulation, hypocrisy. These are part of me too ‚Äì regardless of what experience in my life set them in motion, still they ricochet around my psyche, barely seeing the light of consciousness awareness because they're so unappealing to my ego. ""Message received."" That ""this is a dream."" All of it ‚Äì then‚Ä¶ ""I"" am a dream too.

And this is where it got simultaneously beautiful and harrowing. At the peak of this ketamine trip, as I feel my body let go of the anger, shame, hatred, etc. ‚Äì let go by recognizing their temporary (dream-like) nature ‚Äì I also feel the absoluteness of Death, which can bring a cold terror.

I felt waves of gratitude and yet emotional challenges kept coming. This massive failure of the past was a dream. That disturbing relationship rupture was a dream. All my personae in other people's minds, my social presence, even the deep connections ‚Äì all a dream.

**Come-Down**

I practiced Standing Rock Pose, an innovation from u/AdWaste6918. When he posted about this practice recently, I remarked both that (1) it may be very unsafe for some people to attempt this practice and (2) that it seems to me, based on yogic intuition, that it would be a very useful tool.

I stood very slowly. Out of respect for ketamine's effects on muscular coordination, and for my ruptured disk in my lower back (which is almost unnoticeable if it's not flaring up). There was definitely a sense of visceral satisfaction when I reached full standing posture, my feet on the meditation mat.

Then I noticed what u/AdWaste6918 had described. My thoughts got much quieter as an exquisite, subtle attention spread through my body. I was aware of the constant small adjustments going on, how my body was ‚Äì without the need for my conscious intention ‚Äì performing an incredible choreography of these tiny adjustments to keep me in the standing posture. This brought a sense of wonder, gratitude, confidence. Even though I was wobblier than usual, I was also far more aware of the body's instinctual magic.

And I became aware of my feet. Every subtle shift of the body, every set of small movements of the muscles of the torso, hips, legs, there would be a corresponding tiny response in the feet and toes. It was a vivid demonstration of the consciousness that resides in the feet, which is why some Tibetan lineages list the bottoms of the feet in their chakra systems.

I consciously made some subtle adjustments to get into Mountain Pose, a yoga asana I associate with confidence and openness. I pulled my shoulders back and then allowed them to settle into a position that opened the middle of my ribcage, the ""heart center."" I tucked my chin slightly to elongate the back of the neck, allowed my pelvis to tilt back so that I could stand effortlessly. I stayed in this posture for 21 conscious breaths. Confidence and gratitude washed over me as I stood, not wobbling but still deeply tripping. I sat down as slowly as I'd stood.

I decided it was time to introduce cannabis and I took three puffs from a vape. After the Standing Rock experiment, I felt grounded in my meditation in an unusual way. The confidence was palpable and I think this enabled me to keep practicing the tantric Dream Yoga in that ketamine-cannabis primal soup of emotion and memory.

And it was time to practice with desire, apparently. All sorts of seductive shapes, surges of erotic longing, as the visuals took over. ""This is a dream,"" I offered as my body responded to the hallucinations. Again there was that dual experience ‚Äì peace and bliss would wash over me when I let go of these dream-fantasies, but then they would come surging back. I did my best but this was a stormy sea.

This is why tantric yoga is famously difficult for many practitioners. What's the difference between allowing such fantasies to arise and inviting them into the dream, versus simply indulging your pleasure-seeking mind in a non-yogic way? In the framing of ""carry the emotions onto the path,"" what exactly is the path and how do you know you're on it?

It wasn't just desire, there was a flurry of emotions, scenes from my life bringing so much feeling. ""This is a dream."" Accept it and let it go. Love the dream itself and, in the poet Allen Ginsberg's words, love ""the beings in the dream, trapped in its disappearance."" And so we wrap back to Death.

And Ben, whose death I witnessed in 2019, who visited me in the dream the night before and sang ""Let it Be"" with me.

This journey was stunningly beautiful and also wrenching, I am exhausted now and will go to bed early. I feel calm and content, though I can tell in my bones there's still a lot to process.",1,1758565856.0,KetamineStateYoga,0,1.0,False
1nnuirz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nnuirz/hr_my_boots_are_covered_in_mud/,[HR] My Boots are Covered in Mud,"I don't know if I've gone insane. I keep telling myself I'm writing this for anyone who likes to wander into the cosmos of their own mind like a warning, like a flare. Still, it could be me trying to pin the world to the page so it stops slipping.

Backpacking has always been my anchor. When I was a kid and everything got too loud, I'd take off into the woods behind our place in Georgia, walk until the cicadas turned into a single long sound and the air went cool under the trees. I liked how the forest swallowed noise. I liked how light got filtered through pine needles and spider silk. The Appalachians feel different than other places. It's not quiet like a library. It's peaceful, like the mountain is pushing its thumb on the pulse of the land and slowing down life.

Moving to Florida for work felt like getting relocated to a frying pan. Flat, hot, sticky. The air down here doesn't move; it sits and sweats. I can't see a horizon without a billboard stuck in it. But the mountains are only eight hours away if you leave in the dark and drive like your brain depends on it. So I do. I still do. Those trips back up to Georgia feel like going home to a version of myself I don't have to explain.

We planned this two-day trip for the past month. Jake, Brandon, and I. I should say it now: my name is Hunter. Jake's been my friend since we were dumb kids getting scraped up on BMX bikes. Ten years of knowing exactly how he'll react before he does. He's serious. Responsible but in that quiet way that makes you forget he's always taking care of something. Brandon is a later addition. Jake's buddy from college. Like a stray that started following us around and then refused to leave. Brandon's the guy who always has a story, and it's always half true, and the other half is the part that should have killed him. He recently dived into a hot tub at a party. He fractured two vertebrae, then stood up with his neck crooked, asking if anyone thought he needed a hospital. Somehow, he didn't die from the break, and even more impressively, he is ready to join us on a hike again, only a year later. He brags about stealing Aldi steaks like it makes him an outlaw. He's dumb lucky, and I never really liked him, but Jake did, so I put up with him constantly doing stupid shit.

Last trip out, Brandon tossed a lighter into the fire ""as a joke,"" and it popped and burned neat constellations into my tent fly. I patched them with clear tape like Band-Aids on a sky. For this trip, I went overboard with a new bag, a new headlamp, a new tent, and the best food possible. Two frozen steaks for the first night, wrapped in newspaper. A couple of astronaut ice creams that taste like powdered vanilla, but the nostalgia makes it worth it. I found a trail on Reddit that looked like a good one, with less traffic, better views, and steeper climbs than most routes. The thread had a poorly scanned topo map and a comment saying, ""worth it,"" which, in backpacker language, can cover anything from scenic to near-death.

I left on Friday before sunrise. Florida leaked away behind me in long, wet rectangles of light. By Valdosta, the air shifted. By Macon, the sky felt taller. Somewhere after Dahlonega, the hills heaved up into more than a slight hill that Florida calls a mountain, and my shoulders came down out of my ears. I called Jake outside Commerce, and he answered like I dragged him out of a pit.

""It's Friday?"" he croaked. ""Shit. Meet me at my house.""

Jake wasn't packed. Of course, he wasn't. He had ramen and trail mix and nothing like a tent. I tossed him my spare because it's easier than scolding him. We hit the grocery for fuel, and then Jake called Bill, our usual guy. Mushrooms were the plan. Instead, Bill said, ""I've got something new.""

He held up a zip bag to the light: little translucent black gummies with gold flecks suspended inside, like someone had ground up a wedding ring and poured the glitter into jello. He called them stoppers. Said they froze time, but not in a DMT leave-your-body way. ""You're still in the world,"" Bill said. ""Just‚Ä¶ the world gets slow. Sticky. Like the second refuses to change.""

Twenty bucks a pop. Twice the usual. Jake didn't blink. My stomach did. Psychedelics in the backcountry are a dice roll on a good day; time dilation sounded like a dice roll with knives glued on. But I couldn't stop staring at those gummies. The gold didn't look like edible glitter. It looked like metal filings caught in a jellyfish. I said yes before I finished the thought.

We swung by Brandon's. Like always, chaos. His parents were in the house yelling, their voices hitting that too-familiar pitch old arguments have, the one that sounds like a fly trapped between window and screen. Brandon was on the porch drinking from a tall can, laughing at nothing. He had his pack, though. Credit where it's due. When we told him about the stoppers, he grinned like a kid and asked if he could take two.

""No,"" I said, and slapped his hand when he pantomimed snatching the bag. ""One each. We've only got enough for one a night apiece.""

He smiled like he agreed, and his eyes said I'll do what I want.

Up 19 to side roads, the Corolla is complaining like grandpa about every pothole. We stopped at a crusty gas station because the tank light popped on. Four pumps, two dead, a buzzing fluorescent light, and a top sign with the ""P"" in ""Pineview"" burnt out, so it read ""_ineview."" Two guys out front by the ice machine in those puffy jackets that always look damp and never look warm. One watched us while we pumped. He had that too-thin face and jittery jaw. He eased over when he saw the packs and asked, ""You boys going up Asher Mountain?""

We nodded. He shook his head like we'd told him we were swimming across an interstate. ""Don't camp up there. Not at night. Nothing good in those woods.""

Brandon snapped without missing a beat. ""We don't have shit for you, get the fuck out of here.""

The guy's mouth twitched. He spat near our boots and shuffled off, muttering. I told myself it was just the usual mountain lore. Appalachia collects stories like burrs collect pant legs. Every ridge has a thing, every hollow has a dead man's name. I've hiked enough. I've never seen anything but bear scat and people's trash.

The road into the trailhead turned to red clay and ruts. Rain earlier had slicked it to a paste that grabbed the tires and tried to kiss us into the ditch. Trees pressed close, pines and crooked oak, trunks dark with wet, beads of water trembling on leaves like held breath. The Corolla did that sideways slide a couple of times, where your heart falls through your feet, and then the tires grip and catch, and you pretend you didn't almost die.

Trailhead: a tilted wooden post, a bullet-pocked sign, a pull-off with enough room for three cars if everyone likes each other. Gray light under the canopy. The kind of light where a camera would turn the world to fuzz. We lit a joint and passed it, the smoke cut with that wet-leaf smell that always smells like rot and home at the same time. Packs up. Hip belts buckled. Click click. That little happy clatter of metal on metal that means you're about to disappear for a while.

I hadn't hiked this path before. The Reddit map said ""easy first half,"" but either they were lying or the forest decided to express itself. It was narrow, overgrown, a buckthorn slapping trail. Little wet branches whipped our arms and laid cold lines of water across our sleeves. The ground was all roots and hidden holes. The climb hit quick, a steep switchback that woke the lungs like a slap. We fell into the usual pace while going up the steep inclines of the Appalachians. Pass the joint, cough, laugh, and pass the joint. No one is willing to stop smoking and admit that their lungs are on fire from the climb. I can't complain, though, there isn't anything better than the smell of smoke and pine sap. It was getting slippery, though, and the dirt tasted like iron when it sprayed up in your mouth after a slip.

Brandon dropped half the weed in a puddle and swore like we'd pushed him. ""That was the good stuff, dude!""

""You didn't buy it,"" I said, but I was smiling because I was still soft enough to smile.

The fog rolled through in bands like ghost rivers. Sometimes it came up from the valley and slid through the trunks at knee height. Sometimes it hung in ragged sheets between trees, and you had to walk into it like a curtain into another room. When the wind pushed it, it went sideways, and the whole forest blurred like it needed to be wiped with a thumb.

By late afternoon, we climbed onto a ridge with a low rock outcrop. The view unfurled. Green layers of mountains, ridges stacked like old blankets, each one taller than the one in front of it. A vulture circled a lazy loop that made me jealous. I set up the little stove on the flat rock and thawed the steaks. The paper peeled off damp and left newsprint on the meat, which cooked away, and we pretended it made us smarter. Grease dripped, hissed, smelled like five stars. We ate steak and ramen and laughed at how good everything tastes when the air's cold and you worked for it.

Then the sky started bleeding purple, and the trees went black before the ground did. That's when I pulled the zip bag out. The stoppers shimmered in the firelight. The gold flecks woke up when the flames moved, pulsing like they were reacting.

""One each,"" I said. I meant it like a command. Brandon gave me his wide smile, like yes, sir, and still tried to sneak an extra one before my hand hit his head. ""Ouch, what the fuck, dude? I was joking!"" he shouted at me. ""I said one each stop being an asshat."" He dropped it after that and took his one.

The gummy hit my tongue, and my stomach dropped. Gasoline and pennies. There was a chemical top note like paint thinner and a rotten sweet underneath like cough syrup you left in a hot car. It stuck to my teeth, and I had to scrape it off with my tongue. Brandon made a face. Jake rolled his eyes and said, ""That can't be good,"" but chewed and swallowed and then raised his eyebrows like, ""Well, we're committed.""

At first, it was just the campfire. Pop, hiss, spark. The usual comfort. Jake told a story about a guy at work who printed thirty copies of his resignation letter and then forgot to resign. Brandon bragged about a girl who didn't exist. I let the noise move around me and watched the smoke. It went up. It did what smoke does.

Then it didn't.

The smoke folded. It bent like a ribbon being tucked into a pocket. It rolled back down into the flame like the fire had become a drain. The sparks didn't float up and outward. They shot sideways, a little golden school of fish that darted and grouped and then stayed in a knot like they were stuck in glue. I felt the first hair raise on my arms. I blinked, and the fire was like TV static ‚Äî the gray fuzz of a screen an old set makes when you kill the channel, and it hums that low, electric hum you can feel in your fillings. The static ate the shape of the logs and gave back a rectangle of gray noise that looked like heat shimmering on the road, but colder.

Jake had a line of drool shining on his chin and didn't know it. Brandon's mouth fell open and stayed. His eyes were wet, reflecting the static like tiny screens.

""Does the fire look like that to you?"" I asked, and my voice sounded like I was under a blanket.

Brandon said, ""The fire's fine, man. It's the trees.""

We looked. I swear to you, the forest had straightened. The randomness you expect from the different gaps, the weird spacing, and the drunk angles were gone. The trees stood in columns and rows, lined up like pews in a cathedral, trunks in perfect alignment front to back. The gaps between them were identical, cut to measure. In the distance, rocks aligned too, each the same size, spaced like someone used a football field as a ruler and stamped them across the ridge: rock, air, rock, air. My eyes tried to slide off it and instead stuck to the pattern like burrs to socks.

Then I heard water.

It started like a faucet being turned on in another room. A trickle that tickled the ear. It became a stream, then a rush, then full-on waterfall noise planted just out of sight, the kind of sound you feel in your chest and your teeth. It was so obvious, so loud that I said, ""We need water anyway,"" like that was a reason to stand up. We stood up. We left the fire. The rows of trees made walking in a straight line feel like walking down an aisle at the world's worst grocery store. Every time I thought we'd hit a bend in the trail, the bend slid one aisle over, same distance away. When I looked back behind us, the camp was gone. I saw aisle after aisle of trunks, each gap the same. Our firelight was already a lie my brain had told me. The other didn't seem to care, so I just kept walking with them.

We walked toward the roar until it filled the world, and then, as if somebody flipped a switch. Silence. The kind of silence that makes your ears ring their own private sound because the brain refuses to accept anything. No crickets. No owls. Not even wind. Just our boots pressing wet leaves and coming up with that sticky kiss sound.

That's when I realized it was still dusk. It had been dusk when we lit the fire. It was dusk when we stood up. It was dusk right now, even though it felt like half an hour had slid by while the waterfall sound grew and died. The sky had stalled at that bruised color with no stars yet and no sun either, like a clock with its second hand glued down.

I cursed for not bringing my headlamp. It was in my pack. I could have grabbed it. I didn't. That stupid little decision started to feel like the hinge the night swung on.

Brandon licked his lips. They looked pale in the half-light, like someone had pulled the red out of him. ""Do you guys‚Ä¶ still hear the water?""

""No,"" I said, and my voice came out thin. ""It's gone.""

We turned around to walk back, and the forest still hadn't changed. The rows stayed. The rocks stayed. The smell of our fire, meat, and smoke was gone. Our prints didn't show up. It was like we'd been walking on a new floor that rolled over the old one as we moved, covering tracks.

""Well fuck now we have to find our way back,"" I said as we started to move back. That's when I began to feel like something else was walking with us.

At first, it was footsteps that didn't match ours. Softer. The sound of small stones clicking against each other just to the side, like something with narrow feet was testing the ground. Then two of those. Then three. Every time we stopped, the extras stopped. Every time we moved, they resumed. Not in sync. Not echoes. Followers.

I didn't say it. Jake didn't say it. We tightened up without saying it, shoulders in, breaths shallow. Brandon kept glancing to the sides with his eyes only, his head locked forward like prey animals keep it when they listen for predators.

Then the forest started to talk.

An owl called. Not far. Not a deep night voice. A high one. Except it didn't hoot. It said my name. It pulled it apart into syllables like someone reading ""Huuun‚Äîterrr"" off a sheet of paper for the first time. The last r ticked in my ear in a long, dragged-out horror.

We froze. Jake's eyes cut to me. Brandon laughed without breath. ""You guys heard that, right? Tell me I'm not crazy.""

""It's just the drug,"" Jake said, but his jaw was locked.

A coyote yipped. Except it wasn't. It was Brandon's laugh, the exact laugh he'd made two hours ago when he told us the steak story. But it wasn't beside me. It was behind, somewhere down an aisle of trees. It sounded doubled, like it bounced around a long tube and came back as an echo, only the tube wasn't there. The hair on my neck turned to needles.

Brandon's smile fell off. ""That‚Ä¶ that was me,"" he said. Not a question.

We walked. What else do you do? The silence between the noises was worse. My brain put a faint TV hum in there to cover it because it needed something. And then the woods did my mother's voice. Clear as day. The exact tone she used when I was twelve and out after dark. ""Hunter? Time to come inside."" From about two aisles over. I froze in place, but the others didn't seem to hear it. They stopped, and Jake asked, ""What's wrong?"" I quickly snapped out of it and continued, ""Oh nothing lets keep walking."" I didn't want to repeat what I heard, which felt like something I didn't want outside my mind.

We passed the same stump three times. I know it was the same because a thick branch came out at the same angle and broke off at the same place, and the moss on the north side did a weird hook shape that looked like a question mark. Three times. Ten minutes apart. We passed a fallen log with a split that looked like a grin. Twice. The trail didn't turn back on itself. I swear to you it didn't. It reused itself.

I pulled my compass. The needle went slowly. It started to point and then kept going, like syrup sliding around a plate. It did a full circle, tired, then another. We didn't have north anymore. I checked my phone. Forty percent battery, then sixty-two, then nineteen. The clock read 7:12. Then 7:13. Then 7:12 again. I wanted to throw the thing into the trees because it was pretending to be a clock and wasn't.

We stopped to drink water we didn't need. I looked at Jake, and something in my brain stepped back one inch. His eyes looked wrong. Pupils wide, sure, but there was a ring around the iris that looked like the ring on a coffee mug. His mouth hung a little more open than a resting mouth should. His shadow behind him stretched longer than mine by a lot, even though we were next to each other. I blinked, and he was him again, but the afterimage sat there like the halo you see after staring at the sun.

Brandon stared at him and his hand flexed like it forgot if it was supposed to be a fist. ""Why's your face doing that?"" he asked.

Jake sighed. ""What are you talking about?""

""Your eyes,"" Brandon said. ""They're not yours.""

We laughed. We always laugh because what else do you do when tripping balls?

The granola bar thing happened next. I pulled one from my hip pocket, unwrapped it, ate half, and shoved the other half back in. I remember the taste of peanut and stale honey and the way it scratches your throat. Twenty minutes later, I reached for it again to finish it, and the bar was sealed. New wrapper. No tear. No crumbs in the pocket. I held it up and played with the seam, like maybe I had messed up, and then my stomach turned, and I shoved it back like I hadn't seen it.

Brandon's eyes wouldn't leave me. He kept stepping so he could see my face from a new angle without being obvious. He did the same to Jake. He spun, walking backwards for a while, never turning his back to both of us at the same time. The footsteps that weren't ours adjusted with us, trying to keep up, and that was the first time I really wanted to yell. That need hit my throat and died there.

""You're not Hunter,"" Brandon said. Quiet. Like to himself.

I managed a laugh. ""What the hell are you talking about?""

""Your voice,"" he said. ""It's not yours. It's‚Ä¶ wrong."" He looked at Jake. ""And you, your eyes keep freaking out. ""You think I'm stupid? You're not..."" He swallowed like his mouth had dried out. ""You're not you.""

""Brandon, breathe,"" Jake said. Calm voice. The one he uses when I start spiraling. ""It's the drug.""

""The drug's not making the forest straight,"" Brandon said, and he gestured out at all the aisles. ""The drug's not making the rocks line up like someone measured space with a ruler and I‚Äî"" He choked on the next word. ""I heard you behind me, Hunter. I heard you. Laughing.""

""We're all hearing weird things, Brandon. It's just the drug,"" I said in a reassuring voice. Brandon seemed to calm down slightly, and we stumbled upon what looked like the clearing we had set up camp at. A wider patch in the aisles where the rows opened a fraction. A dead stump in the center, like a table. Our fire wasn't there. Nothing from us was there. But the ground looks the same everywhere when it's covered in oak leaves stamped flat and damp, and we wanted out of the aisles, so we stopped. Jake crouched, the old man crouch he does when he's thinking. Brandon kept to the edge with his back to the trees, and pulled his pocket knife out, flipping it over and over in his hand. I could smell iron, which might have been from my cut across the knuckle from a branch, or it might have been in the air. The sky refused to change. Dusk held.

""What time is it,"" I said, and it wasn't really a question. ""7:12,"" Jake said.

""It was 7:12 before,"" Brandon said. ""It was 7:12 an hour ago."" ""We haven't been here an hour,"" I said. My mouth lied. My body said we'd been walking a lifetime.

The clearing had sounds again. Not real ones. It was like someone put in a soundtrack and played it too quietly. Little clicks that wanted to be twigs snapping but didn't commit. A hiss that wanted to be wind but didn't know how to move leaves. Mimic sounds. You could tell by the way the hair on the back of your neck didn't know if it should stand up or lie down.

""Sit,"" Jake said. ""We're gonna ground and ride it out.""

Brandon laughed. Low at first and then high like a kettle. ""Ground? With you? With it?"" He pointed the knife. The point wobbled because his hand was shaking. ""You think I don't see it?""

""See what,"" I said, and the static hum climbed my jaw into the hinge of my ear.

""You,"" he said, and his voice split into two versions that almost matched. ""You're wearing him. Like a suit. Like a... like a deer skull on a man. You think I'm..."" He breathed hard. ""You don't even move right."" I didn't realize I had my hands out until I saw them. Palms open, fingers soft. The universal we're okay gesture you give to a skittish dog. ""Brandon,"" I said. ""It's me. It's Hunter. We ate steak and ramen. You spilled the weed and cried about it.""

His eyes flicked fast like a hummingbird. ""That's easy to say.""

Jake stood slowly. ""Brandon, put the knife down.""

""You say my name like that again and I'll cut it out of your mouth,"" Brandon said. He stepped right, just a hair, so we were no longer in line. He wanted us separated. He wanted our faces in frame one at a time so he could be sure. ""You think I don't hear you two whispering when I look away? You think I didn't see your shadow stretch wrong? Your teeth look longer when you talk.""

""Okay,"" Jake said. ""We're going to breathe. In for""

Brandon moved.

It wasn't clean. It wasn't a movie scene where the bad guy attacks you. He lunged like he forgot how to run and remembered at the last second. The knife came at Jake, low, clumsy, fast. Jake got an arm up and caught the blade across his forearm, a flash of red, a mouth opening in skin. I yelled and grabbed Brandon's wrist and felt the tendons under my palm jumping. He was strong. He twisted like his bones were greased. The knife skated. Jake shoved him, shoulder to chest, and Brandon laughed. That doubled laugh. Two voices almost on top of each other, so it sounded like a chorus with one guy out of time.

We hit the ground in a knot. Leaves in my mouth. Dirt in my mouth. That iron taste again. The knife came down toward my face, and I shoved the flat of it with my thumb, and it sliced the pad, and I saw white under the red for a second, and then my hand was hit out of view from Jake tackling Brandon. They rolled. They hit the stump. Brandon swung the knife and caught Jake shallow across the ribs, and the sound Jake made was like a dog being kicked, and my chest locked, and something inside me said rock.

There was a rock at my knee, flat, hand-sized, and wet. I picked it up. It felt heavy in a way rocks are heavy, but also in a way rocks aren't. I didn't think. I didn't reason. I ran to where Brandon and Jake were still on the ground and swung. It caught Brandon across the side of his head, and he went off, his eyes trying to focus on me and not getting there. The knife wobbled. Jake kicked it, and it skipped into the leaves, and I saw the gleam once and then not again. Brandon tried to stand and couldn't. He laughed again, except this time it wasn't two voices; it was three. His mouth didn't match any of them.

""Stop,"" I said. ""Stop, stop, stop, stop!""

He came again, one arm hanging, one arm clawed, and there was no more talking. Jake hit him shoulder-first, and they went down together. I brought the rock down again and again because my brain had become a single command that said Make him stop and didn't have room for anything else. There are noises you make when you lift weights: those came out of me. Then there are noises something makes when it breaks: I won't write those. We stopped when we were both too tired to lift our arms, and the hum in the air faded, and my hands shook like I was going into hypothermia.

Brandon lay back, looking at the canopy. His eyes didn't blink. His chest didn't move. The rows of trees behind him lined up like a barcode that went on forever. Jake's breath came in tears, little shreds. He pressed his hand to his arm, and it came away slick, and he looked at me like he was six and I could fix it.

""We have to..."" I said, and didn't have anything after that. We turned away for a second. Maybe we both did. Maybe only I did. We turned away because the blood looked like a map I didn't want to read. When we turned back, Brandon's body was gone.

We didn't decide to run. We just ran. The aisles blurred. The straight rows made a flicker-book of trunks on either side. Every four steps I looked back and saw nothing and saw everything, depending on how my lungs moved. The footsteps multiplied. The voices got smart. They learned our tones and gave them back wrong. ""Hunter,"" said Jake's twisted voice, from the trees to my right, casual like a friend at a party who wants to tell you a joke. ""Jake,"" said something that sounded like me from the left, soft, almost a question. The owl repeated my name and added Please.

I tripped and ate dirt, and a piece of a stick went into my palm and came out slick, and my hand didn't feel like a hand. Jake hauled me up by the back of my shirt, and we kept going. The rows repeated. We passed the stump with the question mark moss. We passed the log with the grin split. We passed the rock I'd used, or one that looked exactly like it, lying clean in the leaves. I don't know how long we ran. I looked at my phone and saw 7:13. Then I saw 7:12. This shit is never going to end, I thought to myself, and kept running.

At some point, I fell and didn't get up. The world narrowed to the size of two leaves and the thread between them. The hum in my teeth got louder until it was the only thing. Everything got dark like the dimmer turned down, not like a switch. The last thing I remember is my own voice calling from the trees. Not Jake. Not Brandon. Me. The exact way I sound when I'm tired and trying to sound like I'm not. ""Hunter. This way. Hurry.""

And I went. I didn't choose it. My body chose it. I tried to fight, and the world slid, and then it was gone.

I woke up in my bed. I tried to yell, but I had no air. All I could hear is my phone alarm doing the little chime I hate. Blind light striped across the wall. Florida light, flat and colorless. I stared at the ceiling, and it was my ceiling. I lay there and waited for Jake to lean over me and grab me, but nothing happened. I let my breath escape me in a laugh, letting my body push the panic out of me. It was all just some sort of twisted dream my brain made up. I turned over and turned off my alarm. The phone said Friday. The day we were supposed to leave.

It took me a minute to stand. My knees were stiff in that post-hike way like I'd been walking all weekend. My hip flexors did that little click thing. I told myself it was because I slept wrong. My palms ached. My left one burned when I curled it. There was a little tacky spot like a scab line. I told myself I scratched it on something here, at home, in the most normal place in the world. The calendar on the wall in my room said we were leaving today. The printout with the route and mile markers hung by a magnet on the fridge next to a shopping list that said eggs, toilet paper, and steak.

I went to the bathroom sink and turned on the tap. The water that came out sounded like a waterfall, a football field away. It filled the sink, and as I watched, it looked like TV static for half a second and then water again; normal, clean water. I looked at myself in the mirror. My pupils were a little wide, as if a room had dimmed. My mouth hung open just a little because I forgot to finish closing it. I stared at my eyes and waited for a ring to move across them like coffee in a mug, and it didn't. I laughed again, softly, and this time it sounded like someone else, and then it sounded like me again. I could go outside. I could get in the Corolla and drive north. I could knock on Jake's door, and he would open it, and be Jake, and I would be Hunter. We would laugh, and he would ask if I was ready to go. I would say sure, and then my brain would fall through a trapdoor. We would be standing on a ridge, eating steak, and watching a fire's smoke go up like it should instead of down, but when I went to the door to check the weather, I noticed my boots. They were my hiking boots in their usual spot, that I always leave them, but they were wrong. When I knelt down to look at them, I noticed there were tracks from the door that I hadn't cleaned up. Mud tracks, and there was mud on my boots. It was red Appalachian clay.",1,1758565831.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False
1nnuhmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nnuhmx/aita_for_not_wanting_to_put_in_effort_with_my_sil/,AITA for not wanting to put in effort with my SIL when she hasn‚Äôt put in any effort with me for years?,"Okay, this is going to need a lot of background. I (28F) and my husband (31M) have been together for 7 years and just got married this April. When it comes to family, we‚Äôve both gotten on pretty well with each other‚Äôs families. Generally, his family have been extremely welcoming toward me and have tried to include me in everything. All except his sister (28F).
So, when I first got into a relationship with my husband, I was excited to get to know his sister. We were the same age and I don‚Äôt get to see my own sister often as she lives in America and I live in the UK. Plus, my sister in law was friends with some of my friends already. So, the idea of getting to know and being friends with his sister was something I was really hyped about. And initially, I did everything to try and get to know her. I invited her to go shopping, go and get coffee, get drinks, go to the gym, just anything I knew we both could do together. We ended up going out a few times to the gym and to get coffee, but not that often as she wasn‚Äôt always available, but I did see her at his familial events and we‚Äôd chat and have a good time as a group. 

However, I started noticing that whenever I invited her to things after about 6/7 months, she wouldn‚Äôt show up if it was a group event or would tell me she couldn‚Äôt go or even just not respond to the invite. Initially, this wasn‚Äôt a big deal to me, but it reached a point where within the last 7 years that I‚Äôve been with my husband, she‚Äôs only been to one of my birthday events, having been invited to all of them, and she hasn‚Äôt shown up with any other events I‚Äôve hosted. Initially, I chalked this up to her not being interested in the things we did, since I‚Äôm a nerd who likes movie nights and board games, but her not coming to my birthday events every single year, bar this last year after my husband and I got married was kinda hurtful, especially since I went to all of her birthday events and she gets upset when people don‚Äôt turn up to her events.

I‚Äôm sure that she only came to this year‚Äôs birthday event because my husband casually mentioned that she hadn‚Äôt been to my birthday events previously to her and she accused me of essentially shit stirring and lying to him because she didn‚Äôt believe that she hadn‚Äôt come to a single one, and probably just wanted to prove a point and be able to say that she‚Äôs come to one event. Obviously, my husband pointed out that he was there at every event and knew that she hadn‚Äôt come even without me mentioning it (duh). 

My husband says that she‚Äôs just like this with everyone and doesn‚Äôt really put in effort with people when it comes to meeting up, but I think she shouldn‚Äôt then expect everyone to make an effort for her. 

So, I‚Äôve decided that from now on, I want to provide the effort she‚Äôs given me. I‚Äôm not someone who likes putting in effort with people who don‚Äôt put in effort with me, and so, I haven‚Äôt gotten back to her about her birthday bar crawl, which is happening in November, as I don‚Äôt see myself going, and didn‚Äôt attend a drinking night at hers that she hosted recently. In addition, I‚Äôve decided that for my 30th in a couple of years, I want to go to Malta with my friends and husband, but I won‚Äôt be inviting his sister. And this has totally annoyed my husband.

He‚Äôs saying that I‚Äôm being petty and should just keep going to these events and keep inviting her, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really petty, in all honesty. If a friend had stopped putting in effort with me or just didn‚Äôt from the beginning, I would be acting the exact same way towards them and don‚Äôt see this as different just because she‚Äôs my sister in law. I wouldn‚Äôt want to put in effort with a friend who doesn‚Äôt give me any either.

And the frustrating thing is that he agrees with me that her not putting in effort was wrong but that I need to draw a line under the sand and just move on. But I just don‚Äôt want to keep putting the effort in and I‚Äôm not going to be forced to when even pointing out to her that she‚Äôs not turned up to events causes such an aggressive reaction and denial from her, so discussing it with her seems almost pointless.

Anyway, all this is to ask, am I the asshole for deciding that I can‚Äôt be bothered to make the effort anymore?

Bahrain‚Äôs Business Environment: 2025 Snapshot\
\
Alt text: Business environment in a modern Gulf business setting, Bahrain Bay skyline., Bahrain saw a 9.7% jump in new company registrations in Q1 2025, with financial services, logistics, and technology leading the charge. Reuters highlights that regulatory changes‚Äîlike the digitization of company formation‚Äîhave accelerated post-pandemic economic growth, with non-oil GDP projected to rise by 3.4% this year. Bahrain Bay‚Äôs futuristic skyline isn‚Äôt just a symbol; it‚Äôs fueled by real business activity.\
The government, particularly the Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB), upgraded its digital strategy in January 2025 to streamline cross-ministry approvals. Sijilat‚Äôs role has never been more pronounced, making Bahrain one of the most startup-friendly jurisdictions in the Gulf‚Äîbeating even some processes in Dubai and Riyadh for ease and speed.\
Curious to compare costs and market entry for foreigners? Keylink‚Äôs Bahrain company formation guide gives an excellent breakdown.\
Sijilat: Bahrain‚Äôs Digital Company Formation Solution\
What Exactly Is Sijilat?\
Sijilat is the Kingdom‚Äôs official online portal for company registration, overseen by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOICT). Since its latest update in March 2025, Sijilat integrates:\
\
Commercial registration (CR) applications\
Trade name reservations\
Activity selection (over 4,000 codes!)\
E-signature and document upload\
Cross-ministry approvals (LMRA, EDB, Tamkeen, etc.)\
\
All from your laptop‚Äîno need to queue in Diplomatic Area at 7AM.\
Step-by-Step Bahrain Company Registration Online (Through Sijilat)\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, paperwork and digital workflow for Sijilat.:\
- With Sijilat, you select activities directly in the portal, referencing thousands of options.\
Recommended resource: Keylink‚Äôs entity type explainer.\
Popular structures:\
* S.P.C. (Single Person Company)\
* W.L.L. (With Limited Liability)\
* B.S.C. (Closed / Public)\
* Branch office\
* Partnership\
Personal tip: When I formed a tech W.L.L. in Seef, preparation was everything. Know your desired activities and entity type up front‚ÄîSijilat‚Äôs approval team asks for detailed justification if your activity code seems ambiguous. Don‚Äôt shrug this off; poorly chosen codes can delay you by weeks.\
Step 2: Reserve Your Trade Name\
Online via Sijilat, approval typically takes 1-2 working days if you follow these tips:\
- Use unique, non-generic names.\
- Avoid religious or governmental references.\
- Provide three alternatives.\
Step 3: Prepare and Upload Documents\
\
Alt text: Paperwork and office workflow, business registration document preparation.\
- Proof of business address (tenancy agreement or commercial property certificate)\
- Articles of Association (template provided by Sijilat)\
Insider hack: Use PDF merge tools to bundle all personal IDs into a single file, drastically reducing upload errors. And, book your notary appointment (if needed) for early morning in Diplomatic Area‚Äînot midweek, when lines stretch out the door.\
Step 4: Pay Registration Fees\
Payment is processed online by debit/credit card. For most W.L.L./SPC formations, expect to pay:\
- Commercial registration fee: BHD 50‚Äì100\
- Activity license fee: BHD 25‚Äì200 (varies by business)\
- Trade name reservation: BHD 25\
For a full cost breakdown, including hidden government and legal fees, visit Keylink‚Äôs Bahrain company formation cost guide.\
Step 5: Await Approval and Download Your E-Certificate\
Sijilat‚Äôs dashboard updates you via SMS/email. In 2025, most standard CRs are issued within 2‚Äì5 working days‚Äîsometimes faster if you avoid Thur/Fri submissions or apply outside Ramadan peak periods.\
Expert shortcut: Don‚Äôt wait for the final CR to prep your LMRA labor registration, bank account documentation, or tenancy contract. I often use pre-approval letters from Sijilat to get a head start‚Äîshaving days off go-live dates.\
Step 6: Activate Additional Approvals (If Needed)\
Certain activities (e.g., healthcare, education, finance) require sector-specific ministry sign-off‚ÄîSijilat routes your application automatically. For regulated business, factor in an extra 2‚Äì3 weeks.\
Ownership Rules: 100% Foreign or Local Partner?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, professional team handshake. and 99% ownership opportunities.\
Personal aside: When registering my own consulting business, I found the Sijilat portal flags permitted and restricted sectors transparently. Tech, logistics, and advisory services get full foreign access, while retail and restaurants may still require a Bahraini partner (see sponsorship options here).\
Company Registration Costs in 2025\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation, calculator and business documents.\
- Office/registered address rental: BHD 1,000+ per year (shared offices in Bahrain Bay start at BHD 1,200/year, while Manama souq options drop as low as BHD 600)\
- Notarization/legalization: BHD 50‚Äì150\
- Professional agent‚Äôs support (optional): BHD 300‚Äì800\
See full cost details (with case studies).\
Pro budgeting tip: Use offices in Seef or Bahrain Bay for prestige and speed (offices in older districts sometimes trigger extra compliance checks). And, always ask your landlord for a multi-year lease discount up front (I saved BHD 400/year this way).\
Common Challenges & Insider Fixes\
Importantly, Sijilat is fast‚Äîif you prepare all documents correctly the first time. My toughest moment? A client used mismatched shareholder names between the passport scan and typed portal input. Result: a 3-week delay. Always double-check spelling, as manual corrections require a MOICT counter visit. (Yes, I had to make that drive to Diplomatic Area and charm my way through a majlis-style queue, full of business card exchanges over tiny cups of gahwa.)\
Common mistakes:\
- Wrong or incomplete activity codes\
- Uploading photos instead of scanned PDFs\
- Missing the time window for next-day notary appointments (book by 9AM!)\
Time-Saving Tricks:\
\
Submit applications between 8-9AM (Sijilat review teams clear the morning queue first).\
Use professional consultants for regulated sectors or if you‚Äôre new to Bahrain.\
Prepare supporting evidence‚Äîlike business plans or LOI from partners‚Äîto support unusual activities.\
\
Regulatory Updates in 2025\
In April 2025, MOICT launched a ‚ÄúOne-Stop e-Residency‚Äù for company founders, letting you not only register a CR but also open bank accounts, register for VAT, and activate LMRA labor permissions through a single Sijilat dashboard login. Reuters covered the policy impact here.\
What‚Äôs Changed?\
\
Reduced in-person visits from 2-3 to ‚Äúzero‚Äù for most business types\
E-signature acceptance now covers all business contracts\
Integration with Tamkeen for startup grants (no extra applications)\
\
This makes Bahrain‚Äôs process significantly more agile than Saudi or UAE, which still require physical document submissions for certain steps.\
Business Culture Quirks During Company Set-Up\
Majlis networking remains powerful. Even as processes are digitized, senior officials value relationships. I‚Äôve watched approvals accelerate after a friendly chat over coffee at the downtown Manama hotel lobby, especially during Ramadan when business hours shift and patience is tested. Always prepare for in-person backup‚Äîeven with Sijilat at your fingertips.\
Ramadan note: Schedule all official submissions by noon to avoid post-iftar administrative backlogs.\
And, never underestimate the power of a personalized thank-you after approval. Bahrain‚Äôs officials appreciate a follow-up‚Äîeven a simple WhatsApp message can help with ongoing compliance.\
Bahrain vs. UAE and Saudi Arabia: Why Sijilat Wins for Startups\
A brief tangent: Last year, I helped a startup choose between Dubai, Riyadh, and Bahrain. While UAE‚Äôs free zones are excellent (see Bahrain‚Äôs free zone alternatives), only Bahrain‚Äôs Sijilat allowed for direct, online, real-time approvals‚Äîno couriering passports or multiple power-of-attorney forms.\
Compliance After Formation: What‚Äôs Next?\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, contract signing in Bahrain business.)\
* Renew CR annually (online, via Sijilat)\
* Update shareholder/director records as needed\
* File annual returns and pay VAT, if applicable\
Non-compliance triggers warnings, fines, or suspension of your CR. I always recommend adding a compliance calendar to your phone reminders‚Äîand appointing a local accountant if you‚Äôre overseas.\
Where to Get Help: Top Resources\
\
Alt text: Professional business support, customer service and consultant discussion.: Deep local expertise, especially for overseas founders\
* Official MOICT portal: For regulatory updates\
* Gulf News: Business headlines and new policy alerts\
A personal recommendation: If you‚Äôre new to Bahrain, work with a consultant for your first CR. The learning curve is steep, especially around document translation, and a good agent can unlock hidden business networking opportunities (my own business grew from a random referral at a Seef District notary office!).\
Bahrain Online Company Registration FAQ\
Q1: Can I set up a Bahrain company 100% online from overseas?\
Yes, provided you have all scanned documents and a local registered address. E-signatures are accepted. Some sectors may require notarized copies or video ID checks. See more: Keylink‚Äôs formation guide.\
Q2: How long does Sijilat company formation take?\
For standard activities: 2‚Äì5 working days. Regulated businesses (e.g., healthcare, finance): 2‚Äì3 weeks. Always apply outside Ramadan for fastest processing.\
Q3: What are the main costs?\
Budget BHD 500‚Äì2,500 for government fees, address rental, and legal requirements. Compare current costs here: Keylink‚Äôs Bahrain company formation cost page.\
Q4: Do I need a Bahraini partner?\
Not for most consulting, tech, advisory, or industrial activities (100% foreign ownership allowed). Retail/restaurant sectors often require a local partner. Clarify with Keylink‚Äôs activity list.\
Q5: What happens after I get my CR?\
Register with LMRA for labor access, open a bank account, and set up accounting. For full compliance tips: Keylink‚Äôs accounting services guide.\
\
\
Expert‚Äôs opinion: If you value speed, investor-friendly policies, and reliable online systems, Bahrain‚Äôs Sijilat is the region‚Äôs gold standard for hassle-free company formation‚Äîespecially if you combine it with local customs and a few personal connections.\

1nnuesp,https://www.reddit.com/r/spooky_stories/comments/1nnuesp/detective_long_story/,Detective (long story),"Detective Marcus Hale had seen things that would have destroyed lesser men. He used to joke that homicide hardened him, but lately the joke never landed. Not when the corpses kept piling up‚Äîeach one worse than the last. And not when he saw the thing.

The first body was in a small apartment off Willow Street. A young woman, mid-twenties, laid out across her mattress as though she'd been carefully posed. Blood stained the sheets in wide, dark blooms. Her throat had been slit, but it wasn‚Äôt the wound that froze Marcus in place. It was the shadow standing in the corner.

No one else reacted to it. The uniforms bustled around, snapping pictures, collecting fibers, talking about forced entry. Marcus stood in silence, staring. The figure was tall, skeletal, its limbs too long, its skin stretched tight like parchment. Its eyes‚Äîif they were eyes‚Äîwere deep pits, glistening with a sick wetness that made him think of drowning. Its mouth was split wide across its face, a jagged maw filled with teeth that clicked faintly as if grinding bones. And it was smiling.

Marcus said nothing. He'd learned long ago what happened when he mentioned the things only he could see. He‚Äôd been called unstable, a drunk; he‚Äôd been pulled off a case once because he‚Äôd insisted he‚Äôd seen a face in the fog. The department tolerated him because he solved murders better than anyone else. But the truth was, Marcus wasn‚Äôt solving them‚Äîhe was following the demons.

The spree started quietly. One body every few weeks, spaced out, brutal but not unheard of. Then the pace quickened. A man gutted in an alley. A child found in a playground, her small limbs arranged like a grotesque puppet. A banker discovered in his locked office, eyes scooped out and tongue nailed to the desk. Every scene, Marcus arrived to find the same demon watching from the shadows. Sometimes it lingered, sometimes it moved. Always, always smiling.

He started drinking more, trying to blur the edges of reality. But even drunk, he saw it. It would appear in mirrors when he shaved. Reflected in store windows when he walked home. Once, he woke up in his own bed to find it crouched at the foot, its jaws clicking softly in rhythm with his heartbeat. When he blinked, it was gone.

Weeks turned into months. The killings escalated. People whispered about a serial killer, a monster walking among them. Marcus knew the truth‚Äîthe monster wasn‚Äôt human at all. The demon wasn‚Äôt just watching anymore. It was feeding. And Marcus, cursed with sight, was its chosen witness.

He tried to track it, following patterns, locations, anything that might tie the victims together. But the demon wasn‚Äôt bound by logic. It killed at random, tearing apart lives with surgical cruelty. Families destroyed, children orphaned, entire neighborhoods frozen in fear. Marcus grew gaunt, hollow-eyed, haunted. His captain threatened to pull him off the case, said he was ""too close."" Marcus almost laughed. Too close? He was drowning in it.

Then the dreams began. He dreamed of the victims calling his name, their voices hollow, echoing. They would beg him to stop it, to save them, but their faces melted into red sludge as they spoke. Behind them, the demon loomed larger and larger, whispering things Marcus couldn‚Äôt repeat without retching. He‚Äôd wake up soaked in sweat, sometimes with scratches across his chest, raw and bleeding as though claws had raked him.

The city grew restless. News outlets screamed of a terror on the loose. Citizens turned on the police. And still the bodies came. Marcus started keeping notes, scribbling frantically in a leather-bound book he locked in his desk. He drew sketches of the demon‚Äôs face, its endless teeth, its dripping eyes. He wrote the phrases it whispered in his dreams‚Äîstrings of words that made no sense, yet burrowed into his skull like maggots. ‚ÄúHe feeds on grief. He thrives on silence. He chooses you.‚Äù

One night, Marcus tailed a suspect reported lurking near the latest scene. The man seemed ordinary‚Äînervous, jittery, the way anyone would be under suspicion. As Marcus shadowed him down an empty street, the demon appeared again. Not in the distance this time, but directly behind the suspect. It towered over him, claws draped on his shoulders like a grotesque lover. Its mouth opened wide, teeth gnashing, but Marcus heard nothing‚Äîjust the man‚Äôs terrified breaths.

And then, the man turned, looked straight at Marcus, and whispered, ‚ÄúDo you see it too?‚Äù

Marcus froze. His blood turned to ice. The man‚Äôs eyes were wide, pleading, desperate, but before Marcus could respond, the demon moved. With a speed that bent reality, it tore into the man, ripping him open in silence. By the time Marcus stumbled forward, gagging on the smell, the demon was gone. Only the corpse remained‚Äîguts spilling into the gutter, eyes rolled back in horror.

Marcus couldn‚Äôt tell anyone what he saw. He filed it like every other case, hiding the truth. But the seed was planted: someone else had seen it, if only for a moment. He wasn‚Äôt alone. Or maybe the demon wanted him to think that.

The killings continued. Marcus stopped eating, stopped sleeping. His notebook filled with incoherent ramblings, drawings that grew darker and more twisted with each passing day. The demon followed him everywhere now. He saw it in crowds, its face blending with strangers. He heard its teeth grinding in the hum of his refrigerator, the static of his TV, the buzz of the streetlamps outside.

Detective Ruiz, his partner, tried to anchor him. Ruiz was the kind of cop who joked to keep the dark out, who brought coffee and sometimes sat on Marcus‚Äôs desk and pretended everything would be fine. Marcus loved Ruiz like a brother. One morning, Marcus found him slumped over his desk, his face torn away, peeled like a mask. Pinned to the wall above him, written in blood, were scrawled letters that only Marcus could read: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost time.‚Äù

Marcus broke that night. He laughed until he sobbed, until his throat burned raw. He realized the truth‚Äîhe wasn‚Äôt chasing the demon. The demon was leading him. Every step, every clue, every victim‚Äîit was a trail, and Marcus was the hound on its leash.

But the trail had started to circle.

Small things began to betray him. A smear of blood on his coat after a long shift, the taste of copper on his tongue when he woke in a place he didn‚Äôt recognize. CCTV footage from a convenience store showed a figure in the background‚Äîtall, blurred‚Äîwalking away from a dead woman‚Äôs building at two in the morning, hands covered in something dark. Marcus watched the frames until his eyes bled. He recognized the coat. He recognized the gait. His stomach turned inside out; his heart hammered like a trapped animal. He told himself it was a double‚Äîsomeone framing him‚Äîbut the way the shoulders slumped in the footage was exactly his own tired slump.

He started losing time. He would go to interrogations and then find bruises on his arms that he couldn‚Äôt explain. A police radio would be buzzing in the evidence room, recorded 3 a.m. dispatches that placed him near scenes he had no memory of visiting. He would open his leather notebook to find pages he didn‚Äôt remember writing: lists of addresses, names he‚Äôd never heard of, dates circled in frantic red. On one page, in his own shaky handwriting, was a single phrase he hadn‚Äôt written in weeks: ‚ÄúFor him.‚Äù

At the coroner‚Äôs office, fingerprints from the latest scene matched‚Äîimpossibly‚Äîto his. The lab called him in for a quiet conversation. He listened to the analyst speak in clinical terms: partial prints on a shattered frame; DNA traces in a smear of skin beneath a victim‚Äôs fingernails. Marcus stared at his hands as if they belonged to someone else. He could feel the demon at the edges of his thoughts like a hot coal. Every time he tried to grasp it, the coal slipped through his fingers, burning them, leaving behind a blackened imprint that smelled faintly of rot.

The department began to whisper. Colleagues avoided his eyes. The captain lectured him in the cramped privacy of the captain‚Äôs office and told him to take leave. Marcus agreed, nodded, and left with a smile so thin it cut. That night, he sat in his kitchen and went through his apartment like an accused man searching for evidence that might exonerate him. But the evidence was everywhere‚Äîlittle things that added up: the demon‚Äôs teeth marks in a torn glove in his laundry bin, dried blood under the sole of his shoe, a hair that wasn‚Äôt his caught in a seam of his coat that under the microscope looked wrong in a way words couldn‚Äôt hold.

Worse than the physical proof were the memories that filtered back like slivers of a shattered mirror. Not full recollections‚Äîonly flashes: the metallic slap of a throat opened, the weight of a body in his arms, the obscene click of a mouth that was not human against human skin. Each fragment felt wrong because they were stitched into his ordinary life‚Äîmemories of making coffee, answering a child‚Äôs question at a school crossing, then a burst of red and the smell of hot iron. They were stitched by the demon‚Äôs needle, sewing violence into ordinary days until Marcus could no longer tell which seams were his and which were not.

He began to follow himself. In the dim hours when the city breathed slow and hollow, he tailed the man in the faded coat who appeared on camera. He watched the man move through alleys, watched him stand in doorways, watched the man‚Äîthe man who was him‚Äîtilt his head and listen for something none of the living could hear. Once, Marcus saw the man crouch in the dark and press his forehead to a child‚Äôs cheek as if to listen to a heartbeat. Only after did the child stop moving.

When he confronted his reflection, the glass didn‚Äôt lie. The eyes staring back at him were hollowed, black-rimmed, and in certain lights something within their depths shifted. In the mirror, the right side of his face drooped ever so slightly, and a jagged line of teeth flashed for a heartbeat beneath his skin. He slammed the mirror and felt it answering with a muffled wet giggle that was both his and not.

The more Marcus resisted, the clearer the truth became: the demon had been inside him all along. The realization did not arrive like revelation but like diagnosis‚Äîslow, clinical, and inevitable. He had thought he was chosen to witness, that sight was a curse laid upon him to watch another feed. But the pattern of fingerprints, the CCTV, the blood‚Äîthese were not evidence of being framed. They were the body of his life, stitched together with his own hands.

There was a night when he finally bled into confession. He tore open his notebook and wrote until his hand ached, ink pooling where the nib hesitated. He wrote the names of the victims in meticulous columns, the dates, the locations, the way the demon arranged them afterward‚Äîbecause even when the otherness took control, there was a part of him that stayed to admire the work. He wrote the whispered phrases the thing taught him, the rituals it preferred, the cadence of the killings. He wrote about waking in gutters with someone else‚Äôs breath on his neck, about coming to, smeared with other people‚Äôs screams. He wrote, painfully, that sometimes the demon would let him watch through its eyes as it moved, and those vicarious views would be the only pleasure he felt for days.

When he scrawled the penultimate line, his hand shook so hard the letters tore across the paper. Beneath it, in the smallest print, he wrote: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me. I am it.‚Äù

He tried to fight. He booked himself into a psychiatric ward under his own name, sat across from doctors and lied, told them about sleepwalking and stress. They prescribed sedatives. He took them and pretended they dulled the hunger, but the hunger came back anyway‚Äîsmaller at first, a gnawing in the belly, then a roaring that filled his ears. He would wake in the hospital garden with soil in his hair, with symptoms of someone who had been digging. He would find a scrap of fabric caught under a fingernail and recognize its weave‚Äîthe same weave as the curtain in the room where a woman had bled out.

Finally, after months of spiral and denial, the answer settled into him like a seed. The demon was not a thing outside him. It was a parasitic architecture that had made its home in his mind, an ancient, smiling intelligence that loved the small human instruments it corrupted. It laid eggs inside grief and patience and turned sympathy into appetite. The demon let him see other demons as a cruel confirmation, a way of proving its reality, of teaching him the vocabulary of its hunger. It let him think he was the observer while it hollowed him out and dressed him in his own skin.

The last killing before he stopped pretending was the worst because it forced the final completions of the loops: the journal entries, the lab matches, the single photograph he couldn‚Äôt erase‚Äîa picture taken by a neighbor‚Äôs motion-activated camera that showed a silhouette at 3:17 a.m., tall and wrong, standing in the hallway of a house where no one lived anymore. The silhouette‚Äôs head was tilted to one side, smiling with a mouth too wide for a human face. The neighbor had emailed the photo to the precinct with a note: ‚ÄúThis man walks the night.‚Äù The file on his desk bore his name.

Standing in the evidence room under a single buzzing fluorescent tube, Marcus thumbed the photograph and felt something in his chest uncoil like a knife. He had the sudden, simple clarity of someone at the center of a storm. The demon‚Äôs voice‚Äîhad it ever really been a voice?‚Äîwhispered against the inside of his skull not as instruction now but as recognition. ‚ÄúYou understand,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúYou are ours and we are you. You wear us and we wear you. Do not be afraid.‚Äù

Marcus laughed then, a small, ugly sound that tasted like ash. He leaned his forehead against the metal drawer of the evidence locker and let himself slide down until the floor was cold against his shoulder blades. He could have turned himself in. He could have told everyone: the lab, the captain, the city he had sworn to protect. He could have begged them to take him apart like a machine to see why the demon lived in him. But the knowledge didn‚Äôt bring relief. It brought appetite, and where there is appetite there is only motion toward its satisfaction.

He thought about how easy it had been to be chosen. How the demon had first tasted him in grief‚Äîafter his wife‚Äôs death, in the raw, open wound of loss‚Äîand how it had slipped a hand into that wound and turned his sorrow into something else. It had taught him to watch suffering like a connoisseur, to find the notes of panic and despair and savor the bouquet. It had turned his policing into a ritual, a dance where the steps always ended with bone and blood.

He stood up. The fluorescent hum steadied his breath into a rhythm. The photograph between his fingers warmed like a living thing. He looked at his hands; they trembled. He could see, in the vein-pale skin along his wrist, the shadow of teeth moving just below the surface. Marcus realized then that the demon had never been a foreign intruder to be expelled. It was a passenger who had become the driver, and the driver had been using his face for so long that nobody‚Äîleast of all him‚Äîcould tell where one ended and the other began.

When the knock came at his door that night‚Äîsoft, practiced‚Äîthe demon was already harvesting the quiet in his chest. He opened to the darkness as if to bless it. A neighbor had called about noises. The city had tightened its net of suspicion, and the police were courteous now, almost clinical. They asked questions first‚Äîroutine questions about his whereabouts. Marcus answered without thinking, in the same even tone he used to give reports. He watched, with what small mercy remained to him, the confusion dawn across their faces as he recounted a version of the night that fit other mens‚Äô memories. They took notes. They went away.

He closed the door and sat down at his kitchen table where the knife lay on a dishtowel, gleaming plain as any utensil. The demon‚Äôs shadow pooled behind him, its smile wider than any human mouth could hold. Marcus felt warmth travel down his arms. He raised the knife. He could have killed himself then‚Äîsliced, clean, the end of story. But the thought curdled into something obscene. The demon had taught him the taste of power, the unique heaven of making things end. He had been a detective, a man who chased answers. He had been a judge, then an executioner. The roles had telescoped until they were indistinguishable.

He pressed the blade to his palm and felt the hot line of pain. It centered him horribly, like a clock striking a terrible hour. The demon leaned close, and Marcus could feel the rasp of its breath like pages turning. He thought of the faces he‚Äôd watched fade, of the way their bodies had become ornaments in the private gallery the demon kept in his head. He thought of Ruiz, of the little girl in the playground, of the woman on Willow Street. He thought of the captain‚Äôs disappointment, and the city‚Äôs hungry headlines. He thought, clearer than anything else, of the long, inevitable logical mercy in the last act.

Then he smiled.

It was the demon‚Äôs smile, wide and wet and too many-toothed, and it moved his lips like a puppet. In the mirror across the room, his reflection slowed for a beat and then matched him, and where his face should have been, for an instant, there was the thing‚Äîa thing that had been wearing him for months. Marcus‚Äîthe man who had chased demons and been laughed at‚Äîhad become the demon‚Äôs last and most perfect joke: a killer who could see what he was, and still choose it.

He rose, knife in hand, and the city slept. The next morning, detectives would find blood on his hands and on the table, and they would fill in the empty templates of motive and madness. They would speak of stress and psychosis; they would point at the evidence and sigh with the tired comfort of explanation. A long time later, some junior cop would unlock his leather notebook and read the sentences where he admitted everything, and then discard it‚Äîanother suicide note in a drawer full of human failures.

But the truth would be simpler, and more terrible. Marcus had been watching demons for months because, in the end, he had been one. He had been their screen, their mask, their quiet house. The demon had not needed to control him so much as to inhabit him, to rewrite his wants until murder was comfort and confession was decoration. He could still see them‚Äîother demons skulking in corners, delighted with their mimicry‚Äîbut his sight had become an archive rather than a warning.

When the city finally connected the dots and the headlines turned into hunts and the hunt circled closer, Marcus met the officers at his own doorway with a face that was still human enough to be pitied. He said nothing. He let them read the scene as they needed to. He let them call his name. And when they asked why, when they pried at the raw and the ugly, he opened his mouth and smiled‚Äîproperly, genuinely‚Äîand said, without tear or tremor, ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt believe me if I told you.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt. They never did. Not really.

Some nights now, when the lights are low and the city breathes shallow, Marcus walks the same alleys he once patrolled with a radio and a badge, only now he is lighter. He is carries the taste of nights in his mouth, and he hears the familiar teeth clicking in his throat. He admires the night the way artists admire their masterpieces: with a kind of cruel, reverent love. When he tilts his head in the dark, he hears, faint and pleased, the echo of another voice‚Äîhungry, amused, and utterly satisfied.

He is the witness. He is the witness no longer. He is what watched. And the city keeps on sleeping, wrapped in the thin comfort of the living pretending they are safe as long as they can‚Äôt see what walks inside one of their own.",1,1758565588.0,spooky_stories,0,1.0,False

1nnue5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1nnue5v/detective_long_story/,Detective (long story),"Detective Marcus Hale had seen things that would have destroyed lesser men. He used to joke that homicide hardened him, but lately the joke never landed. Not when the corpses kept piling up‚Äîeach one worse than the last. And not when he saw the thing.

The first body was in a small apartment off Willow Street. A young woman, mid-twenties, laid out across her mattress as though she'd been carefully posed. Blood stained the sheets in wide, dark blooms. Her throat had been slit, but it wasn‚Äôt the wound that froze Marcus in place. It was the shadow standing in the corner.

No one else reacted to it. The uniforms bustled around, snapping pictures, collecting fibers, talking about forced entry. Marcus stood in silence, staring. The figure was tall, skeletal, its limbs too long, its skin stretched tight like parchment. Its eyes‚Äîif they were eyes‚Äîwere deep pits, glistening with a sick wetness that made him think of drowning. Its mouth was split wide across its face, a jagged maw filled with teeth that clicked faintly as if grinding bones. And it was smiling.

Marcus said nothing. He'd learned long ago what happened when he mentioned the things only he could see. He‚Äôd been called unstable, a drunk; he‚Äôd been pulled off a case once because he‚Äôd insisted he‚Äôd seen a face in the fog. The department tolerated him because he solved murders better than anyone else. But the truth was, Marcus wasn‚Äôt solving them‚Äîhe was following the demons.

The spree started quietly. One body every few weeks, spaced out, brutal but not unheard of. Then the pace quickened. A man gutted in an alley. A child found in a playground, her small limbs arranged like a grotesque puppet. A banker discovered in his locked office, eyes scooped out and tongue nailed to the desk. Every scene, Marcus arrived to find the same demon watching from the shadows. Sometimes it lingered, sometimes it moved. Always, always smiling.

He started drinking more, trying to blur the edges of reality. But even drunk, he saw it. It would appear in mirrors when he shaved. Reflected in store windows when he walked home. Once, he woke up in his own bed to find it crouched at the foot, its jaws clicking softly in rhythm with his heartbeat. When he blinked, it was gone.

Weeks turned into months. The killings escalated. People whispered about a serial killer, a monster walking among them. Marcus knew the truth‚Äîthe monster wasn‚Äôt human at all. The demon wasn‚Äôt just watching anymore. It was feeding. And Marcus, cursed with sight, was its chosen witness.

He tried to track it, following patterns, locations, anything that might tie the victims together. But the demon wasn‚Äôt bound by logic. It killed at random, tearing apart lives with surgical cruelty. Families destroyed, children orphaned, entire neighborhoods frozen in fear. Marcus grew gaunt, hollow-eyed, haunted. His captain threatened to pull him off the case, said he was ""too close."" Marcus almost laughed. Too close? He was drowning in it.

Then the dreams began. He dreamed of the victims calling his name, their voices hollow, echoing. They would beg him to stop it, to save them, but their faces melted into red sludge as they spoke. Behind them, the demon loomed larger and larger, whispering things Marcus couldn‚Äôt repeat without retching. He‚Äôd wake up soaked in sweat, sometimes with scratches across his chest, raw and bleeding as though claws had raked him.

The city grew restless. News outlets screamed of a terror on the loose. Citizens turned on the police. And still the bodies came. Marcus started keeping notes, scribbling frantically in a leather-bound book he locked in his desk. He drew sketches of the demon‚Äôs face, its endless teeth, its dripping eyes. He wrote the phrases it whispered in his dreams‚Äîstrings of words that made no sense, yet burrowed into his skull like maggots. ‚ÄúHe feeds on grief. He thrives on silence. He chooses you.‚Äù

One night, Marcus tailed a suspect reported lurking near the latest scene. The man seemed ordinary‚Äînervous, jittery, the way anyone would be under suspicion. As Marcus shadowed him down an empty street, the demon appeared again. Not in the distance this time, but directly behind the suspect. It towered over him, claws draped on his shoulders like a grotesque lover. Its mouth opened wide, teeth gnashing, but Marcus heard nothing‚Äîjust the man‚Äôs terrified breaths.

And then, the man turned, looked straight at Marcus, and whispered, ‚ÄúDo you see it too?‚Äù

Marcus froze. His blood turned to ice. The man‚Äôs eyes were wide, pleading, desperate, but before Marcus could respond, the demon moved. With a speed that bent reality, it tore into the man, ripping him open in silence. By the time Marcus stumbled forward, gagging on the smell, the demon was gone. Only the corpse remained‚Äîguts spilling into the gutter, eyes rolled back in horror.

Marcus couldn‚Äôt tell anyone what he saw. He filed it like every other case, hiding the truth. But the seed was planted: someone else had seen it, if only for a moment. He wasn‚Äôt alone. Or maybe the demon wanted him to think that.

The killings continued. Marcus stopped eating, stopped sleeping. His notebook filled with incoherent ramblings, drawings that grew darker and more twisted with each passing day. The demon followed him everywhere now. He saw it in crowds, its face blending with strangers. He heard its teeth grinding in the hum of his refrigerator, the static of his TV, the buzz of the streetlamps outside.

Detective Ruiz, his partner, tried to anchor him. Ruiz was the kind of cop who joked to keep the dark out, who brought coffee and sometimes sat on Marcus‚Äôs desk and pretended everything would be fine. Marcus loved Ruiz like a brother. One morning, Marcus found him slumped over his desk, his face torn away, peeled like a mask. Pinned to the wall above him, written in blood, were scrawled letters that only Marcus could read: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost time.‚Äù

Marcus broke that night. He laughed until he sobbed, until his throat burned raw. He realized the truth‚Äîhe wasn‚Äôt chasing the demon. The demon was leading him. Every step, every clue, every victim‚Äîit was a trail, and Marcus was the hound on its leash.

But the trail had started to circle.

Small things began to betray him. A smear of blood on his coat after a long shift, the taste of copper on his tongue when he woke in a place he didn‚Äôt recognize. CCTV footage from a convenience store showed a figure in the background‚Äîtall, blurred‚Äîwalking away from a dead woman‚Äôs building at two in the morning, hands covered in something dark. Marcus watched the frames until his eyes bled. He recognized the coat. He recognized the gait. His stomach turned inside out; his heart hammered like a trapped animal. He told himself it was a double‚Äîsomeone framing him‚Äîbut the way the shoulders slumped in the footage was exactly his own tired slump.

He started losing time. He would go to interrogations and then find bruises on his arms that he couldn‚Äôt explain. A police radio would be buzzing in the evidence room, recorded 3 a.m. dispatches that placed him near scenes he had no memory of visiting. He would open his leather notebook to find pages he didn‚Äôt remember writing: lists of addresses, names he‚Äôd never heard of, dates circled in frantic red. On one page, in his own shaky handwriting, was a single phrase he hadn‚Äôt written in weeks: ‚ÄúFor him.‚Äù

At the coroner‚Äôs office, fingerprints from the latest scene matched‚Äîimpossibly‚Äîto his. The lab called him in for a quiet conversation. He listened to the analyst speak in clinical terms: partial prints on a shattered frame; DNA traces in a smear of skin beneath a victim‚Äôs fingernails. Marcus stared at his hands as if they belonged to someone else. He could feel the demon at the edges of his thoughts like a hot coal. Every time he tried to grasp it, the coal slipped through his fingers, burning them, leaving behind a blackened imprint that smelled faintly of rot.

The department began to whisper. Colleagues avoided his eyes. The captain lectured him in the cramped privacy of the captain‚Äôs office and told him to take leave. Marcus agreed, nodded, and left with a smile so thin it cut. That night, he sat in his kitchen and went through his apartment like an accused man searching for evidence that might exonerate him. But the evidence was everywhere‚Äîlittle things that added up: the demon‚Äôs teeth marks in a torn glove in his laundry bin, dried blood under the sole of his shoe, a hair that wasn‚Äôt his caught in a seam of his coat that under the microscope looked wrong in a way words couldn‚Äôt hold.

Worse than the physical proof were the memories that filtered back like slivers of a shattered mirror. Not full recollections‚Äîonly flashes: the metallic slap of a throat opened, the weight of a body in his arms, the obscene click of a mouth that was not human against human skin. Each fragment felt wrong because they were stitched into his ordinary life‚Äîmemories of making coffee, answering a child‚Äôs question at a school crossing, then a burst of red and the smell of hot iron. They were stitched by the demon‚Äôs needle, sewing violence into ordinary days until Marcus could no longer tell which seams were his and which were not.

He began to follow himself. In the dim hours when the city breathed slow and hollow, he tailed the man in the faded coat who appeared on camera. He watched the man move through alleys, watched him stand in doorways, watched the man‚Äîthe man who was him‚Äîtilt his head and listen for something none of the living could hear. Once, Marcus saw the man crouch in the dark and press his forehead to a child‚Äôs cheek as if to listen to a heartbeat. Only after did the child stop moving.

When he confronted his reflection, the glass didn‚Äôt lie. The eyes staring back at him were hollowed, black-rimmed, and in certain lights something within their depths shifted. In the mirror, the right side of his face drooped ever so slightly, and a jagged line of teeth flashed for a heartbeat beneath his skin. He slammed the mirror and felt it answering with a muffled wet giggle that was both his and not.

The more Marcus resisted, the clearer the truth became: the demon had been inside him all along. The realization did not arrive like revelation but like diagnosis‚Äîslow, clinical, and inevitable. He had thought he was chosen to witness, that sight was a curse laid upon him to watch another feed. But the pattern of fingerprints, the CCTV, the blood‚Äîthese were not evidence of being framed. They were the body of his life, stitched together with his own hands.

There was a night when he finally bled into confession. He tore open his notebook and wrote until his hand ached, ink pooling where the nib hesitated. He wrote the names of the victims in meticulous columns, the dates, the locations, the way the demon arranged them afterward‚Äîbecause even when the otherness took control, there was a part of him that stayed to admire the work. He wrote the whispered phrases the thing taught him, the rituals it preferred, the cadence of the killings. He wrote about waking in gutters with someone else‚Äôs breath on his neck, about coming to, smeared with other people‚Äôs screams. He wrote, painfully, that sometimes the demon would let him watch through its eyes as it moved, and those vicarious views would be the only pleasure he felt for days.

When he scrawled the penultimate line, his hand shook so hard the letters tore across the paper. Beneath it, in the smallest print, he wrote: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me. I am it.‚Äù

He tried to fight. He booked himself into a psychiatric ward under his own name, sat across from doctors and lied, told them about sleepwalking and stress. They prescribed sedatives. He took them and pretended they dulled the hunger, but the hunger came back anyway‚Äîsmaller at first, a gnawing in the belly, then a roaring that filled his ears. He would wake in the hospital garden with soil in his hair, with symptoms of someone who had been digging. He would find a scrap of fabric caught under a fingernail and recognize its weave‚Äîthe same weave as the curtain in the room where a woman had bled out.

Finally, after months of spiral and denial, the answer settled into him like a seed. The demon was not a thing outside him. It was a parasitic architecture that had made its home in his mind, an ancient, smiling intelligence that loved the small human instruments it corrupted. It laid eggs inside grief and patience and turned sympathy into appetite. The demon let him see other demons as a cruel confirmation, a way of proving its reality, of teaching him the vocabulary of its hunger. It let him think he was the observer while it hollowed him out and dressed him in his own skin.

The last killing before he stopped pretending was the worst because it forced the final completions of the loops: the journal entries, the lab matches, the single photograph he couldn‚Äôt erase‚Äîa picture taken by a neighbor‚Äôs motion-activated camera that showed a silhouette at 3:17 a.m., tall and wrong, standing in the hallway of a house where no one lived anymore. The silhouette‚Äôs head was tilted to one side, smiling with a mouth too wide for a human face. The neighbor had emailed the photo to the precinct with a note: ‚ÄúThis man walks the night.‚Äù The file on his desk bore his name.

Standing in the evidence room under a single buzzing fluorescent tube, Marcus thumbed the photograph and felt something in his chest uncoil like a knife. He had the sudden, simple clarity of someone at the center of a storm. The demon‚Äôs voice‚Äîhad it ever really been a voice?‚Äîwhispered against the inside of his skull not as instruction now but as recognition. ‚ÄúYou understand,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúYou are ours and we are you. You wear us and we wear you. Do not be afraid.‚Äù

Marcus laughed then, a small, ugly sound that tasted like ash. He leaned his forehead against the metal drawer of the evidence locker and let himself slide down until the floor was cold against his shoulder blades. He could have turned himself in. He could have told everyone: the lab, the captain, the city he had sworn to protect. He could have begged them to take him apart like a machine to see why the demon lived in him. But the knowledge didn‚Äôt bring relief. It brought appetite, and where there is appetite there is only motion toward its satisfaction.

He thought about how easy it had been to be chosen. How the demon had first tasted him in grief‚Äîafter his wife‚Äôs death, in the raw, open wound of loss‚Äîand how it had slipped a hand into that wound and turned his sorrow into something else. It had taught him to watch suffering like a connoisseur, to find the notes of panic and despair and savor the bouquet. It had turned his policing into a ritual, a dance where the steps always ended with bone and blood.

He stood up. The fluorescent hum steadied his breath into a rhythm. The photograph between his fingers warmed like a living thing. He looked at his hands; they trembled. He could see, in the vein-pale skin along his wrist, the shadow of teeth moving just below the surface. Marcus realized then that the demon had never been a foreign intruder to be expelled. It was a passenger who had become the driver, and the driver had been using his face for so long that nobody‚Äîleast of all him‚Äîcould tell where one ended and the other began.

When the knock came at his door that night‚Äîsoft, practiced‚Äîthe demon was already harvesting the quiet in his chest. He opened to the darkness as if to bless it. A neighbor had called about noises. The city had tightened its net of suspicion, and the police were courteous now, almost clinical. They asked questions first‚Äîroutine questions about his whereabouts. Marcus answered without thinking, in the same even tone he used to give reports. He watched, with what small mercy remained to him, the confusion dawn across their faces as he recounted a version of the night that fit other mens‚Äô memories. They took notes. They went away.

He closed the door and sat down at his kitchen table where the knife lay on a dishtowel, gleaming plain as any utensil. The demon‚Äôs shadow pooled behind him, its smile wider than any human mouth could hold. Marcus felt warmth travel down his arms. He raised the knife. He could have killed himself then‚Äîsliced, clean, the end of story. But the thought curdled into something obscene. The demon had taught him the taste of power, the unique heaven of making things end. He had been a detective, a man who chased answers. He had been a judge, then an executioner. The roles had telescoped until they were indistinguishable.

He pressed the blade to his palm and felt the hot line of pain. It centered him horribly, like a clock striking a terrible hour. The demon leaned close, and Marcus could feel the rasp of its breath like pages turning. He thought of the faces he‚Äôd watched fade, of the way their bodies had become ornaments in the private gallery the demon kept in his head. He thought of Ruiz, of the little girl in the playground, of the woman on Willow Street. He thought of the captain‚Äôs disappointment, and the city‚Äôs hungry headlines. He thought, clearer than anything else, of the long, inevitable logical mercy in the last act.

Then he smiled.

It was the demon‚Äôs smile, wide and wet and too many-toothed, and it moved his lips like a puppet. In the mirror across the room, his reflection slowed for a beat and then matched him, and where his face should have been, for an instant, there was the thing‚Äîa thing that had been wearing him for months. Marcus‚Äîthe man who had chased demons and been laughed at‚Äîhad become the demon‚Äôs last and most perfect joke: a killer who could see what he was, and still choose it.

He rose, knife in hand, and the city slept. The next morning, detectives would find blood on his hands and on the table, and they would fill in the empty templates of motive and madness. They would speak of stress and psychosis; they would point at the evidence and sigh with the tired comfort of explanation. A long time later, some junior cop would unlock his leather notebook and read the sentences where he admitted everything, and then discard it‚Äîanother suicide note in a drawer full of human failures.

But the truth would be simpler, and more terrible. Marcus had been watching demons for months because, in the end, he had been one. He had been their screen, their mask, their quiet house. The demon had not needed to control him so much as to inhabit him, to rewrite his wants until murder was comfort and confession was decoration. He could still see them‚Äîother demons skulking in corners, delighted with their mimicry‚Äîbut his sight had become an archive rather than a warning.

When the city finally connected the dots and the headlines turned into hunts and the hunt circled closer, Marcus met the officers at his own doorway with a face that was still human enough to be pitied. He said nothing. He let them read the scene as they needed to. He let them call his name. And when they asked why, when they pried at the raw and the ugly, he opened his mouth and smiled‚Äîproperly, genuinely‚Äîand said, without tear or tremor, ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt believe me if I told you.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt. They never did. Not really.

Some nights now, when the lights are low and the city breathes shallow, Marcus walks the same alleys he once patrolled with a radio and a badge, only now he is lighter. He is carries the taste of nights in his mouth, and he hears the familiar teeth clicking in his throat. He admires the night the way artists admire their masterpieces: with a kind of cruel, reverent love. When he tilts his head in the dark, he hears, faint and pleased, the echo of another voice‚Äîhungry, amused, and utterly satisfied.

He is the witness. He is the witness no longer. He is what watched. And the city keeps on sleeping, wrapped in the thin comfort of the living pretending they are safe as long as they can‚Äôt see what walks inside one of their own.",1,1758565548.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

1nnubal,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nnubal/the_thing_in_the_maple_grove/,The Thing in the Maple Grove,"The first time I saw the grove, I thought it was diseased. Not rotting, exactly, but corrupted. It was late October, the air sharp with the smell of decaying leaves and wood smoke, and I was checking my traplines along the northern ridge of my property. I've lived my whole forty-three years in the shadow of these mountains, and I know these woods like the back of my own hand. Or I thought I did.

The maple grove sits in a shallow bowl between two hills, a place where the light gets caught and filtered, turning everything a pale, watery gold in the afternoon. Normally, it's the prettiest spot on my land. But that day, the color was all wrong. The reds of the leaves weren't the usual vibrant, bloody crimson; they were a dark, purplish hue, like a fresh bruise. The yellows were sallow, jaundiced. And the quiet. That was the first thing that truly set my teeth on edge. 

A woods is never truly hushed. There's always the scrabble of a squirrel, the call of a jay, the sigh of the wind through branches. This was a dead, muffled stillness, as if the grove was holding its breath. Even in broad daylight, with the sun directly overhead, the air inside that bowl felt thick and wrong, like breathing through wet cloth.

I stood at the edge of the tree line, my old Remington 870 cradled in the crook of my arm, and just listened. Nothing. My boot crunched on a fallen twig as I took a step forward, and the sound was absurdly loud, swallowed almost instantly by the heavy air. I remember feeling a prickle on the back of my neck, the kind you get when you know you're being watched. I scanned the trees, looking for the reflective gleam of eyes, but saw nothing. Just those sickly, bruise-colored leaves and the grey, skeletal branches.

I'd been a trapper since I was a boy, taught by my grandfather. It's not a glamorous life, but it's an honest one. I know the patterns of the animals, their comings and goings. And I knew that nothing‚Äînot a deer, not a rabbit, not even a goddamn bird‚Äîwould willingly go into that grove. My traplines, which usually showed plenty of sign, ended abruptly at its border. It was like an invisible fence had been erected, and every creature with sense respected it.

Shaking off the feeling, I chalked it up to a long week and an overactive imagination. I turned to leave, deciding to give the grove a wide berth, when something caught my eye. A flicker of movement deep within the trees. It was quick, a shift of shadow that was too tall and too thin to be a deer. My grip tightened on the shotgun. ""Hello?"" I called out, my voice flat and dead in the stillness.

There was no answer. Just that same oppressive hush. Then, from the heart of the grove, came a sound. It was a soft, wet cracking, like someone stepping on a pile of rotten fruit. But slower. Deliberate. *Crack. Squelch. Pause. Crack. Squelch.*

I didn't wait to hear more. I backed away, keeping my eyes on the grove until I was a good fifty yards up the ridge. The feeling of being watched didn't leave me until I was back on my porch, the solid oak door locked behind me.

I told myself it was probably a bear. A sick one, maybe, explaining the strange behavior of the wildlife. But I'd never seen a bear move like that shadow had moved. It was‚Ä¶ unnatural. All of it felt poisoned.

That was three days ago. I tried to put it out of my mind, focusing on salting the pelts I'd collected and splitting wood for the winter. But yesterday, my dog, Gus, a hound mix with more courage than sense, didn't come back for his dinner. Gus never misses a meal. I remember the day I brought him home as a pup, how he'd wolf down his food so fast I worried he'd choke, then look up at me with those amber eyes like he was asking for seconds. Ten years old now, and he still attacked his bowl like he'd been starving for weeks.

This morning, I found his tracks leading straight towards the maple grove. They disappeared at the exact same spot where I'd stopped. There were no tracks leading back out. Even in the harsh morning light, with frost glittering on the grass, the grove looked wrong. The shadows inside it were too deep, too dark for the angle of the sun. The corruption wasn't bound by night and day‚Äîit was bound to that place, that bowl of diseased earth.

Now, as the sun begins to dip below the hills, casting long, distorted shadows that seem to claw their way towards my house, I'm sitting here with a cold cup of coffee and my shotgun across my knees. I can hear something else, carried on the wind that's finally picked up. It's faint, but unmistakable. It sounds like a dog whining. It sounds exactly like Gus.

But Gus never whined. Not once in the ten years I had him. Even when I accidentally caught his paw in the truck door, he just looked at me with those patient eyes and waited for me to free him. He was the toughest, most stoic animal I'd ever known.

The whining cut through the twilight, a high, pitiful sound that seemed to weave itself between the trees. It was coming from the direction of the grove, no doubt about it. Every instinct told me to run towards it, to find my dog, but the part of my brain that had kept me alive in these woods for four decades screamed to stay put. It wasn't just that Gus never whined; it was the quality of the sound. It was too perfect, like a recording of a dog in distress, played back with a slight, unnatural lag that made the hairs on my arms stand up.

I stood on the porch for a long time, the shotgun cold and heavy in my hands, listening. The whining would start, rise to a frantic pitch, then stop abruptly, leaving a vacuum that felt even more threatening. After the third cycle, I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't leave him out there, even if it was a trap. I loaded a fresh shell into the chamber, the click echoing in the quiet, and stepped off the porch.

I didn't go straight for the grove. That would have been suicide. Instead, I circled wide, keeping to the high ground where the spruce grew thick, their needles muffling my steps. The air had turned cold, carrying the damp, earthy smell of coming frost. From the ridge, I had a clear view down into the bowl where the maples stood. In the fading light, the bruise-purple leaves were now a deep, venous black, and the hush around them was absolute. The whining had stopped the moment I left the porch.

I used my binoculars, scanning the edge of the tree line. Nothing moved. But then I saw them: tracks. Not Gus's. These were fresh, made in the soft mud of a seep that spring fed from the hill. They were long and narrow, with a deep, precise impression at the front that split into two distinct toes. They looked almost like deer tracks, but wrong. Too elongated, and the stride was enormous, covering ground in a way that suggested a creature walking on two legs. The tracks led from the grove, headed towards my house, and then looped back. They had come within fifty yards of my porch before turning around.

My blood ran cold. It had been watching me. While I was standing there, listening to that fake whining, it had been right there, studying me.

I needed to talk to someone. Isolation is a trapper's lot, but this was different. This felt like a siege. The closest neighbor is old man Hemlock, who lives a mile down the valley. He's been here even longer than I have, a bitter, weathered relic who claims his family settled this land before the state was a state. I don't like him much‚Äîhe's got a mean streak wider than the valley‚Äîbut he knows things about these mountains that nobody else remembers.

I found him on his rickety porch, sharpening a knife on a whetstone. The rhythmic *shhh-click, shhh-click* was the only sound. He didn't look up as I approached, but I could see the tension in his shoulders, the way his weathered hands gripped the knife handle a little too tight.

""Hemlock,"" I said, my voice rough.

He finally glanced at me, his eyes pale and watery in a face like cracked leather. There was something haunted in those eyes, something that hadn't been there the last time I'd seen him. ""What do you want?""

""Something's wrong up by the maple grove. On my land.""

He stopped sharpening. The sudden stillness was more unnerving than the rhythmic scraping had been. ""The bowl?""

I nodded. ""Yeah. The bowl. The trees‚Ä¶ the color's off. And there's something in there. It took my dog.""

He let out a dry, rattling laugh that turned into a cough. But the laugh was forced, hollow. His knuckles were white where he gripped the whetstone. ""Took your dog? Probably a coyote. Or a cat. You're getting spooked, boy."" He went back to his knife, but the rhythm was off now, jerky. *Shhh-click.*

""It wasn't a coyote."" I told him about the corruption in the grove, how it persisted even in daylight, the shadow, the tracks. I didn't mention the whining. That felt too insane to say out loud.

When I described the tracks, his hands stilled completely. He looked past me, towards the ridge where my property lay, and I saw genuine fear flicker across his features. ""Two-toed?"" he asked quietly.

""Yeah. Like a deer, but not.""

He was quiet for a long time. The wind picked up, whistling through the gaps in his cabin's logs. When he finally spoke, his voice was barely above a whisper. ""My grandfather,"" he said, ""he talked about a thing that lived in the deep hollows. A thing that got lonely. It wouldn't kill you straight off. First, it would learn you. It'd watch from the trees, learn your walk, your voice. It'd practice."" He looked me dead in the eye, and I saw something break in his expression. ""It makes sounds to draw you in. Sounds you want to hear. A baby crying. A friend calling for help. A dog whining.""

My mouth went dry. ""What is it?""

He shrugged, a slow, weary movement, but his hands were shaking now. ""Don't know if it ever had a name. He just called it the Hollow One. Said it couldn't stand empty spaces. Couldn't abide them. Had to fill them up with something. Usually, it was with you."" He pointed his knife towards my land, the blade trembling slightly. ""If it's in that grove, you leave it be. You seal up your house and you pray it gets bored. You don't go looking for your dog.""

""I can't just leave Gus.""

""Gus is gone,"" he said, and there was a finality in his voice that felt like a tombstone slamming down. But also something else‚Äîa terrible understanding, as if he'd lost something himself. ""That thing wearing his sound ain't him. It's just the hollow left behind."" He stood abruptly, almost knocking over his chair. ""You need to go. Now. And don't come back here after dark.""

There was genuine panic in his voice now, and it infected me. He'd seen this before. Known this fear. As I walked away, I heard him calling out behind me, his voice cracked and desperate: ""Don't listen to it! Whatever it sounds like, don't listen!""

The walk home was the longest mile of my life. Every rustle in the undergrowth sounded like a footstep. Every creak of a branch sounded like a voice. Hemlock's words echoed in my head. *It learns you.* I thought about the shadow I'd seen, how it had moved. I thought about the tracks circling my house.

When I got back, the night was full dark, but even in the starlight, I could see that the grove's corruption was spreading. The grass at the edge of my property line was browning, wilting in patches that led like a trail toward my house. Whatever was in that bowl wasn't content to stay there. It was reaching out, claiming more ground.

I locked the door and bolted it, something I almost never do. I sat by the window with the shotgun, watching the tree line. The woods were never truly dark; starlight or moonlight usually gave the snow or the pale bark of the aspens a soft glow. But the maple grove was a pool of absolute blackness, a hole cut out of the night.

An hour passed. Then two. I must have dozed off, because the sound jolted me awake.

It was a voice. My voice.

""Hello?"" it called from the edge of the woods. It was my own tired, strained baritone, perfect in every inflection. ""Is anyone out there? I think I'm lost.""

It was me, calling for help. The mimicry was flawless. A cold sweat broke out all over my body. I gripped the shotgun so hard my knuckles ached.

The voice came again, closer now. ""Hello? I can see your light. Please.""

It was using my own voice to lure me out. Hemlock was right. It was learning. And it was at my door.

***

The voice outside was my own, but frayed at the edges with a panic I hadn't let myself feel yet. ""Hello? I can see your light. Please."" It was perfect, down to the slight catch in my throat I get when I've been breathing cold air too long. I stayed frozen by the window, the wooden floorboards cold under my socks. My finger rested on the trigger guard of the shotgun, a tremor in my hand I couldn't quite still.

Answering it felt like madness. But letting it stay out there, learning, practicing my voice until it could fool anyone‚Ä¶ that was a different kind of death. Hemlock's words echoed: *It learns you.*

I made a decision. I couldn't shoot what I couldn't see, and opening the door was suicide. But I had to disrupt it. I had to show it I wasn't an easy mark.

I moved to the door, keeping low, and pressed my face against the rough wood near the hinge. I took a deep breath, and then I shouted, my real voice booming in the confined space of the cabin. ""I know what you are! Get off my land!""

The hush that followed was immediate and absolute. It was more unnerving than the mimicry. It was a listening quiet. I could feel it out there, just beyond the door, processing. Then, a sound started, low and soft. It wasn't my voice anymore. It was the sound of claws, long and delicate, scratching slowly down the length of the door. A dry, rasping whisper, like bone on wood. It started at the top and dragged all the way to the bottom. I could picture it, standing there, running its fingers‚Äîor whatever it had‚Äîdown the door in a grotesque caress.

Then it stopped. I heard footsteps, not trying to be quiet anymore. They were heavy, with that same two-toed gait I'd seen in the mud, but now they crunched on the gravel path leading away from my house. They were heading back towards the maple grove.

I waited until the sound faded completely before I let out the breath I'd been holding. My heart was hammering against my ribs. It had come to my door. It had touched my house. The violation of it made me feel sick. I spent the rest of the night barricaded in, dozing fitfully in a chair, every snap of the cooling wood stove making me jump.

At first light, I unbarred the door. The morning was crisp and still, the sky a pale, washed-out grey. I half-expected to see some mark on the door, but the wood was unblemished. No scratches, no footprints on the porch. It was as if it had never been there. But when I stepped off the porch and looked at the gravel, my blood went cold. There, in the damp earth beside the path, was a single, fresh two-toed track. It was deep, as if it had stood there for a long time, watching.

And beside it, pressed into the mud, was something else. A tuft of coarse, grey hair. Gus's hair. I remembered how he'd shed like crazy every spring, leaving tumbleweeds of fur rolling around my cabin. I'd complained about it then, but now I'd give anything to sweep up another pile of his hair.

That was it. The grief and rage I'd been suppressing boiled over. It had taken my dog. It had come to my home. It was taunting me. I wasn't going to wait for it to get bored. I was going to the grove.

But first, I had to check on Hemlock. His terror the night before had been real, and something told me he was in as much danger as I was.

I loaded the shotgun with buckshot, stuffed extra shells in my coat pockets, and took my grandfather's old hunting knife from its sheath on the mantel. The bone handle was smooth and familiar in my grip. The walk to Hemlock's place was eerily quiet, even for mid-morning. No birds, no squirrels. Just the crunch of frost-brittle grass under my boots.

His cabin looked normal from the outside, smoke rising from the chimney, but something was off. His door was standing open, just a crack, and there was no sound of movement from inside. I called out as I approached. ""Hemlock? You in there?""

No answer. The stillness around his place felt familiar now, the same dead calm that surrounded the grove. I pushed open the door with the barrel of my shotgun.

Hemlock was sitting in his chair by the fire, the whetstone in his lap, the knife in his hand. At first glance, he looked like he was just resting. But his eyes were open, staring at nothing, and there was no rise and fall to his chest. On the table beside him was a plate of half-eaten food, still warm. He'd been dead less than an hour.

There were no marks on him, no sign of violence. But on the floor beside his chair was a small puddle of that black, viscous sap I'd seen weeping from the maples. And the smell‚Äîthat sweet, coppery rot‚Äîhung thick in the air.

It had come for him in the night. Not to kill, not exactly. To hollow him out. To learn him. And then it had left him behind, empty.

I backed out of the cabin, my hands shaking. The grove wasn't just claiming animals now. It was claiming people. And I was next.

The woods were unnaturally hushed as I approached the grove. No birds chirped, no squirrels chattered. But unlike the crushing stillness of the past days, this felt expectant, like the entire forest was holding its breath. As I neared the bowl, the familiar dead zone began. The sounds faded away completely, replaced by that oppressive, muffled quiet. The air grew still and cold, and the smell hit me‚Äîa sweet, cloying odor of decay, like overripe fruit and something else, something metallic, like copper.

I stopped at the tree line, just as I had days before. The maples stood in their twisted circle, their leaves that same sickly purple-black, but now I could see they weren't just diseased. They were feeding. The ground inside the grove was bare of any undergrowth, covered only in a thick layer of fallen leaves that looked unnaturally dark and wet. Several of the larger trees had deep, vertical splits in their bark, weeping that black sap I'd seen at Hemlock's.

And then I saw Gus's collar. It was lying in the center of the grove, the bright red nylon a stark slash of color against the dark earth. The brass nameplate glinted in the weak light‚Äîthe same nameplate I'd had engraved at the feed store when he was just a pup, so proud to have his first real dog. It was just sitting there, clean, as if it had been placed deliberately.

I knew it was a trap. A blatant, obvious lure. But seeing that collar, the one I'd buckled around his neck when he was small enough to fit in my lap, broke something in me. I stepped across the threshold into the grove.

The change was instantaneous. The temperature dropped ten degrees. The quiet became absolute, a physical pressure on my eardrums. The sweet-rotten smell was so thick I could taste it at the back of my throat. I took a few steps forward, my boots sinking into the spongy leaf litter. Every sense screamed at me to run.

I was halfway to the collar when I heard the sound behind me. A soft, padding footstep. I spun around, shotgun raised.

There was nothing there. Just the trees, watching.

Then, from my left, a whisper. It was my own voice again, but this time it was calm, conversational, the way I sound when I'm talking to Gus. ""It's alright, boy. Come on out.""

I swung the gun towards the sound. Nothing.

A branch snapped to my right. I turned again, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The grove seemed to be closing in on me, the trees leaning inward.

The voice came from directly behind me, so close I could feel a faint disturbance in the air. ""I'm lost.""

I whirled, finger tightening on the trigger, and saw it.

Not all of it. Just a glimpse, a flicker of movement between two thick trunks. It was tall, far taller than a man, and impossibly thin. Its skin was the color of bleached bone, and it seemed to blend with the trees, its limbs long and jointed wrong. I didn't see a face, just a suggestion of a head that tilted at an unnatural angle. Then it was gone, melting back into the shadows.

But it left something behind. Hanging from a low branch was a small, tattered piece of cloth. I stepped closer, my heart pounding. It was a strip of red flannel, the same pattern as the shirt Hemlock had been wearing yesterday. There were dark stains on it that looked suspiciously like that black sap.

A new sound began, echoing softly through the grove. It was the rhythmic *shhh-click, shhh-click* of a knife being sharpened on a whetstone. Hemlock's sound. It was perfect, down to the slight irregularity when he'd pause to test the blade's edge.

And it was coming from multiple directions at once.

The sound of Hemlock's whetstone surrounded me, a metallic chorus coming from every shadowed space between the trees. *Shhh-click. Shhh-click.* It was a taunt, a reminder that everything I knew was being consumed and played back at me. The strip of red flannel hung from the branch like a flag of surrender. Hemlock hadn't been lying‚Äîhe'd been a lesson. A demonstration of what happened when the Hollow One learned you completely. And now it was my turn.

I stood my ground, the shotgun stock pressed hard against my shoulder. Panic was a cold fire in my veins, but beneath it was a colder, harder core of fury. This thing had taken my dog. It had killed Hemlock. It had violated my home. It thought it knew me. It thought I was just another hollow to be filled.

But Hemlock's words came back to me: *It can't stand empty spaces. Had to fill them up.* If it needed to fill silence with sound, needed to fill hollows with something‚Ä¶ what if I gave it nothing?

""Show yourself!"" I roared, my voice cracking in the dead air.

The whetstone sounds stopped. In the hush that followed, I heard a new sound. A soft, wet crunching, the same one I'd heard days ago, but closer now. Much closer. It was coming from directly behind the tree where the flannel hung.

I didn't wait. I fired.

The blast was deafening, a shocking violation of the grove's stillness. The buckshot tore into the trunk, splintering bark and sending shards of wood flying. The crunching sound stopped. For a single, heart-stopping moment, there was nothing.

Then, a sound I will hear until the day I die. It was a low, guttural clicking, a sound no animal around here could make. It was a sound of annoyance. Of irritation. I had not hurt it. I had only annoyed it.

It stepped out from behind the tree.

It was taller than I'd imagined, seven feet at least, and so thin it seemed to waver like a heat haze. Its skin wasn't bark-colored; it was the color of old bone, stretched taut over a frame of impossible angles. Its legs reversed like a deer's, but its arms were too long, ending in hands with two long, twig-like fingers and an opposing thumb. It had no face. Where a face should have been was a smooth, pale expanse, broken only by a long, vertical gash that I realized was a mouth, currently smeared with something black and viscous. Sap. It was feeding.

But it was what hung from its neck that made my breath catch in my throat. Gus's collar. The red nylon was a garish necklace on the pale thing. It had put it on like a trophy.

It tilted its headless head, and from the gash of a mouth, my own voice emerged, calm and measured. ""It's alright, boy. Come on out.""

It was repeating what I'd said to Gus a thousand times, when he was hiding under the porch during thunderstorms, when he was reluctant to come back from his explorations. It had learned my life, catalogued every sound I'd ever made around my dog.

I fired again, this time aiming center mass. The thing moved with a speed that was pure liquid shadow. It flowed to the side, and the shot peppered the ground where it had been. It didn't run. It just‚Ä¶ shifted. And then it was closer.

It smelled of wet earth and that coppery sweetness, a smell so thick it was a taste. I backpedaled, fumbling for another shell. My hands were shaking so badly I dropped it. The thing watched me, its body making small, twitching adjustments. It was learning my fear, cataloguing every tremor, every panicked breath.

It took a step forward, its two-toed feet sinking into the spongy ground without a sound. Then another. It was herding me. Deeper into the grove.

I saw then what I hadn't noticed before. In the very center of the bowl, the earth was not just bare; it was sunken, a shallow depression filled with those dark, wet leaves. And protruding from the leaves were bones. Animal bones, mostly. A deer skull. The long rib cage of a bear. And nearer to the edge, something smaller. A canine jawbone, weathered and old. And next to it, a fresher kill. A rabbit, its fur matted and dark.

This was its larder. This was where it brought things. This was where it hollowed them out.

It was between me and the way out. I had one shell left in the chamber. My knife was in my hand, a pathetic sliver of steel against this thing. Hemlock's words came back to me: *It can't stand empty spaces. Had to fill them up.*

An idea, desperate and insane, formed in my mind. It learned sounds. It needed to fill the quiet with something familiar, something it could understand and use. What if I gave it nothing to learn? What if I became the empty space it couldn't tolerate?

As it took another gliding step towards me, I did the hardest thing I've ever done. I stopped. I lowered the shotgun. I forced my breathing to slow, forced the terror down into a tight, hard ball in my gut. I looked past it, at the trees beyond the grove. I made my mind a blank, white wall. I became nothing.

The thing stopped. It tilted its head again, that smooth expanse where a face should be turning toward me like a flower following the sun. The gash-mouth opened and my voice came out, laced with a questioning tremor. ""Hello?""

I didn't move. I didn't speak. I was a statue. I was empty. I was the void it couldn't fill.

It took a step closer, its smell overwhelming. It was so close I could see the fine cracks in its bone-white skin, the way the black sap oozed from the pores around its mouth. It raised one of its long-fingered hands and reached for my face. I flinched internally but held my ground, my eyes still fixed on the distance. The fingers stopped an inch from my cheek. They were cold, radiating a deep, unnatural chill.

It was confused. I was not behaving according to the script it had learned. There was no fear-sound, no anger-sound, no pleading. There was just‚Ä¶ nothingness. A hollow it couldn't fill because there was nothing there to fill.

It made that low, clicking sound again, this time with a note of frustration. It leaned in, its faceless head hovering next to mine. The gash-mouth opened wide, revealing rows of small, needle-sharp teeth, and it tried one last thing. It emitted a soft, perfect whimper. Gus's whimper. The sound he'd made the day I found him as a stray pup, hungry and scared and alone.

It was the most heartbreaking sound I have ever heard. Every fiber of my being screamed to respond, to call his name, to reach out. But I didn't. I held onto the emptiness inside me like a lifeline. I was a void. I was nothing.

The creature recoiled as if struck. It let out a shriek that was a mosaic of every sound it had ever collected‚Äîa bear's roar, Hemlock's rattling cough, my own shout, the screech of a hawk, Gus's bark, a dozen voices I didn't recognize‚Äîall layered into a single, discordant wail of rage and confusion. It couldn't stand my emptiness. It turned and flowed away from me, melting into the deeper shadows of the grove, its form blurring until it was gone.

The quiet returned, heavier than ever. I didn't wait to see if it would come back. I ran. I crashed through the tree line, not stopping until I was back on my porch, heaving lungfuls of clean, cold air.

I survived. But I am not the same. The grove is still there. I see it from my window, a wound on the land that seems to pulse with its own malevolent life. I don't go near it. The corruption is spreading, slowly but steadily, dead patches of grass reaching like fingers toward my house. Sometimes, at night, I hear things. A voice calling my name. The sound of a whetstone. A dog whining. But now, I hear another sound, too. One I never heard before that day in the grove. A low, frustrated clicking, coming from just beyond the tree line. It's learning new sounds, adding them to its collection. It's patient.

And sometimes, when the wind is right, I smell that sweet, coppery rot getting stronger. It's getting closer, claiming more ground each day. I sit in my silent house, my own hollow, and I wait. I know it can't stand the emptiness. But I also know that eventually, even the deepest void finds something to fill it. And when that happens, I'll have nothing left to give but myself.

The thing in the maple grove is still learning. I‚Äôm leaving tonight, torching this cabin and everything in it. But when I step outside, the silence follows me like a shadow. Maybe I escaped. Or maybe I just carried the hollow with me.",3,1758565372.0,nosleep,2,0.8,False

1nnu8k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nnu8k2/barista_express_replacement_500/,Barista Express replacement [¬£500],"I have lots of questions, and I can see many have been asked before on this sub, so I'll try to keep as brief as possible! Thanks in advance.

My Sage (Breville) Barista Express has just died and I need a replacement.

I generally liked it. My only complaints were:
a) milk frothing took forever 
b) grinder needed to be at its absolute finest for most beans
c) hopper and grinder retains a LOT of beans, so not easy to switch out different beans for a single brew. 

Other than that, I was able to brew (what I considered to be) a pretty good drink. 

I mostly drink straight espresso, flat white and cappuccino.

Usually 2 a day for me, 1 for the missus, and usually for 3-4 guests on the occasional weekend, etc.

I happen to be buying a new house at the moment, so budget is a consideration following this unexpected coffee machine breakdown!

I have been considering the following...
1. Simply get another Barista Express - stick with what you know. 
2. Get the Ninja equivalent - seemed to be mixed opinions on here?
3. Separate grinder and espresso machine.

I guess my main questions are:

Opinions on option 1 vs option 2?

I'm not really into the whole ""workflow"" part of espresso (I know some people enjoy this as much as the drink itself) - more of an end result guy. 

But I have always liked the idea of option 3. 

Am I likely to get an appreciably better coffee with a separate machine a s grinder, given the budget I have? 

Counter space not a concern.

I'm happy buying second hand.

What would the best combo be?

1nnu4h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1nnu4h9/dosage/,Dosage,"My Dr put me on vyvanse 2 weeks ago. She said to start at 10mg and increase by 10mg every 3 days up to 40 until we speak again in a couple of weeks. She said if it feels too much, to return to the previous amount. 

At 30mg I could start to feel a difference in clarity, motivation and organizing thoughts. At 40mg my performance at work is much better, my brain is quieter and I‚Äôm getting things done. It‚Äôs wonderful. However on my days off I find I‚Äôm unable to relax fully. I feel buzzy and anxious and my compulsive habits seem heightened (hair pulling and smoking). Is this normal? I don‚Äôt know what to report back to her because I‚Äôm finding it so helpful at work but not when I give myself permission to relax.

I also find caffeine makes it worse, so I haven‚Äôt been drinking much coffee anymore, though I did have a tea today.",3,1758564962.0,VyvanseADHD,6,1.0,False

1nnu44a,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateDiagnosedAutistic/comments/1nnu44a/midlife_career_crisis/,Mid-Life Career Crisis??,"I'm not really sure where to start so I'll list out some highlights: I'm 43 and was just diagnosed with ASD in March of this year, I'm currently in the middle of yet another burnout and on leave from work. I've never had this level of mental health support, so this is the first time I have ever used my short-term disability, not to mention, the first time I have had more than a week off of work in the last 20 years.

I now know that burnout is the thing that has been happening for as long as I can remember and it  
always presents and affects me most at work. I become completely paralyzed by the pressure of deadlines and expectations and endless meetings and 14-hr days. Once this happens, a switch is flipped, and I begin to see the company for what it really is - another shitty extra in the low-budget horror film that is Corporate America. Even once I make my way out of burnout, I can't unsee this and I am perpetually miserable until I find a new job.

I thought I found my place when I discovered Lean Six Sigma and Process Improvement. I worked my way up to a Black Belt certification and I currently work in a process improvement role with a company that provides technology to help run clinical trials for big pharma (I know, gross). Burnout at this time last year is what led to my diagnosis and here we are again, same place but now I know what is happening to me.

My therapist asked me what the perfect day at work would look like for me: I could wake up in the morning when my body did, not to an alarm; I could enjoy a cup of coffee and not be rushed to get anywhere or get logged in, I could work at my own pace and meet the deadlines that I set for myself; Ideally I would be creating something ‚Äì drawing, photography, branding/logo design, stained glass; I could end my day when I wanted to and still have energy to make dinner for my husband and me, spend some time with him, maybe do some laundry, clean up, read a bit, and go to bed excited for the next day. Basically, I‚Äôd love to be self-employed. Creating something that I love and would bring joy to people.

Is that so unrealistic? Because I‚Äôm starting to feel like it is, but I truly cannot understand why.

I‚Äôm just so tired, y‚Äôall. I want so badly to be happy in my job. Life is pretty good outside of work, but we all know we spend the bulk of our lives working.

I get it. I‚Äôm in a position now where I have become accustomed to a certain salary and I have a (somewhat) reliable job. But at what point do we get to put our mental health first and go after the thing that is scary, but we are sure will make us happy?",4,1758564942.0,LateDiagnosedAutistic,0,1.0,False

Spouse and I cruise multiple mainstream lines over last several years. Being we live in Florida sometimes we take quick staycation cruise just for fun. We booked Paradise knowing full well the age of the ship and recent passenger bad press but truthfully 3 years ago we sailed on sister ship Elation and had a good time. Fast forward 3 years and times are definitely different. Pros/cons are listed

Pros Crusie extremely low compared to 6 days on land.

Con YOU get what you pay for is the adage to remember.

PROS increase security at embarkation including dogs. Not aggressive in my opinion.

 CON Duffy (great inside name) was all over the ship, hallways etc working hard. Also increased security 2 guards on Lido deck all day. Security outside club nightly and other lounges.

PRO
 dining room food was fair to good and service from fast <1 hr if u arrived early but up to 3 hrs if came in at 7. It was obvious not enough staff to operate dinning room

Con
 Buffet some of the worse food I have seen in years. I'm an eater but everything was fried and generally unappealing to the eye. Buffet line constantly dirty and items rarely refilled. Absolutely no instruction on hand washing or even hand washing stations available. We limited meals to dining room, guys or blue iguana or salad bar.

Service At best it was perfunctory at worse dismissive and aggressive. Frequently out of liquor or different bartenders had different rules (some wouldn't give you 2 drinks at once on drink package for both individulas) but recquire you to go up in shifts. For instance at Java house one woman worked most of the time alone and she would have take orders and make drinks. Easily in a.m. it was 20 minute wait to get coffee. PRO Found a great personable bartender on day 2 and she saved the cruise.

Celebration Key PRO Great to have as an option when off the boat.
 CON 
drinks not included. Irritating. Food limited to basics and very small portions. Everything priced at DisneyWorld prices! AND frankly it's like a very small commercial Waterpark. Doesn't feel like an island resort but like your at a hotel pool. MANY resorts in Florida are more tropical then here. Wouldn't go out of my way just to visit.

Entertainment Pro 2 shows and comedy 3 x night every night and karoke

CONS See above.

Ship appearance/ trival Overall I didn't find the over the top out dated decor a problem what got to me was the lack of maintenance to the ship. Even if ship was refreshed and all the obvious burned out lighting replaced and worn surfaces painted she would be impressive but sadly that's not the case: broken furniture, out of service elevators, broken windows, cracked mirrors tapped over, ripped furniture, general abuse without repairs etc.

Also cabin water turned all the white towels brown after shower. That was somewhat unsettling.

Will I go again. Probably not unless on excel ships.",3,1758564933.0,CarnivalCruiseFans,4,0.67,False
