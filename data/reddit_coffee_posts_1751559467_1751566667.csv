This post is for people living near Amsterdam or in the Netherlands. Sorry about it but long distance is not my thing..

I live in Amsterdam and living in Europe for more than 15 years. I am learning Dutch and I’m more confident that I will learn it someday unlike German 😅

I’m a 36-year-old Indian origin, whose father says he is no longer Indian 🤣. Probably because I picked up things from various cultures while living in and traveling to multiple countries, and they really changed how I see and live my life. I’ve light tanned skin, Black hair, Brown eyes, 183cm tall (not tall by Dutch standards, but I can reach things on the top shelf), broad shoulders, slightly muscular, and powered mostly by hugs.

I work in senior management at an international company – fancy title, but still can’t remember name of people I meet.

Now onto the good stuff…

Who am I?

📸 Photography nerd – will lie in mud for the perfect sunset shot.

🏍️ Motorbike rider – nothing beats a long ride with no destination.

🥾 Hiking enthusiast – let’s climb something tall and wonder why we did.

🍳 Lazy-ass cook – food’s great, but I don’t follow recipes, I follow mood.

🍰 Sweet tooth champion – will propose if you bake a great cake.

🏋️‍♂️ Lift weights – Muscles and fitness is as important as eating cake.

✈️ Travel addict – have passport, seen many countries, will explore more. Next dream: settle near water, adopt pets, live slow.

Looking for someone who fit at least one or two things below.

• Enjoys hugs and cuddles like I do oxygen.

• Likes travel, nature, and lazy Sundays.

• Takes care of her body and health (but yes, we can eat cake).

• Is open to pets and future waterside living.

• Love to Bake (or at least enables my dessert addiction).

I love affection – hugs, cuddles, forehead kisses, the whole warm and fuzzy package. I don't enjoy penetrative sex, but show my love/intimacy through touch, affection and closeness. So, if you are comfortable with this and think you can bear with me in real life then send me a message!

Let’s make a life full of adventure, laughter, and cake crumbs.

We will be a good match if you don't think a “great connection” means endless texting and a job interview 😂 Let's have a real-life convo over coffee, a walk, or anything low-pressure.

Note: I’m also looking for new friends (any gender) to hangout and do activities outside but I approach dating and friendships differently, so please mention in your message that you read this post else I will keep you only in friend zone 🤣",1,1751566476.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

It was still night by the time they were approaching the Sand Kingdom’s border. The ethereal moonlight gleamed against the distant dunes that lay beyond verdant flats and dried shrubbery that had dared to mingle with the desert.

Qibli felt a gentle hum from inside his satchel and something in his chest tightened. He discretely peered inside, spitting out a tiny ember for its light.

KINKAJOU IS AWAKE AND FINE. PLEASE TELL TAMARIN. DARKSTALKER TAKING THE TRIBE TO THE OLD NIGHT KINGDOM IN THE MORNING.

A moment later: EVERYONE DEFINITELY UNDER HIS SPELL EXCEPT KINKAJOU.

*Kinkajou! She’s all right!* Qibli held back his elation long enough to close his satchel, then allowed himself a quick excited loop around in the air. Oh how he wished he were still at Jade Mountain so he could tell Tamarin and Sunny and see their faces!

“What are you flapping about like a seal pup for?” Winter asked from his left.

“Nothing important,” Qibli answered. Winter would probably want to know that Kinkajou was all right, but he was still under Darkstalker’s spell. Until he was free from it, Qibli couldn’t risk giving him sensitive information, especially about Turtle. “I’ll tell you if you put on one of my earrings.”

Winter’s eyes narrowed. “You’re never going to let this go, are you?” he mumbled.

“Only one way to stop it.” Qibli flicked his earring with a smirk.

Winter’s punctuated grunt was thick with exasperation; a clear indication he was too exhausted to argue back. Qibli, too, felt his eyelids grow heavy, so they agreed to rest for a few hours.

A shiver crawled through his back, maybe a little bit of warmth would help him relax. The thin branched vegetation that somehow thrived in the arid climate was perfect kindling for a bonfire. But by the time Qibli dug the pit and lit the wood ablaze, Winter was already sound asleep. It would probably burn through quickly, but Qibli wouldn’t stay awake for long either.

Unease still lingered in his mind, unable to stop himself from ruminating on Turtle’s last message. *The old kingdom of night, the one we had to find to save Jade Mountain. Now Darkstalker is going to take his tribe of superpowered followers there, as king. Is Moon going with him? Is she okay, or did Darkstalker enchant her too? And how are we going to get there on our own?* 

Qibli curled into himself and partially buried his snout in the sand. *And what about Tsunami? Did she even make it to the Rainforest with the earrings? Or did something happen to her? Why didn’t Turtle mention anything about that?*

The bonfire began to sizzle its last few embers, the sputters of light unable to reach beyond the pit, leaving the two of them shrouded in darkness. Time somehow passed Qibli by faster than he expected, yet the taut tangle of worry still lingered.

He began to think of Kinkajou and how her bubbly and fearless attitude might have thrown Vulture off. He thought of Moon, and the time they spent together at Possibility waiting for Winter. It helped ease Qibli’s mind and he slowly drifted into slumber.

They awoke at the cusp of dawn; a tiny sliver of the sun, still hidden behind the horizon, illuminated the sky with an oceanic blue. Winter hastily washed his scales in a nearby stream before they continued their journey further into the Sand Kingdom.

They flew for a few more hours until, finally, the hazy outline of the Scorpion Den emerged from the crest of a particularly large dune in the bright morning light.

“We’ll need to walk the rest of the way there,” Qibli brushed Winter with a wing flap for his attention, then pointed at the dunes below. “I can’t disguise you, but we can avoid telegraphing to the whole town you’re here before we’re even inside.”

Winter glanced at the scales of his forearm, wincing slightly as a glimmer of reflected sunlight struck his eyes. He didn’t reward Qibli with a nod, but still followed him to the ground.

The grainy sand that nestled itself between Qibli’s talons as he landed felt like a warm, welcoming embrace. The kind that Thorn would sometimes give him, and hoped Cobra would one day give.

“So what’s the plan?” Winter asked. He grimaced at his talon seasoned with sand, before he tried shaking the grains off. “I sincerely hope it's not just ‘sneak in and hope for the best’.”

“I’m not sure,” Qibli muttered apprehensively. “We’re definitely not sneaking into my grandfather’s compound. It’s the most well-fortified structure in Pyrrhia and it’s littered with traps and mines and wires everywhere.”

“Nonsense,” Winter huffed. “The Great Ice Cliff has repelled invaders for thousands of years. I doubt your grandfather could ever compare.”

“Okay, but,” Qibli continued, ignoring Winter’s pedantic aside, “the important part is that *we can’t* sneak in. One wrong step and oops, there goes a leg. Accidentally trip a wire and suddenly your head is on the ground. So we’ll first gather information on what Vulture’s been up to.” He brought his gaze back up, the gates of the Scorpion Den now in sight. His heart began pounding with trepidation. “Which means visiting my mother. And then… I’ll probably have to talk to… him.”

“That's it?” The immeasurable disappointment in Winter’s voice was palpable, despite the awkward stumbling he began walking with — thrashing and swiping his legs against himself, hoping the sand would eventually stay off his scales. “Saunter up to your crime-lord grandfather, ask him nicely to let Ostrich go, and hope he doesn’t throttle you?”

“There’s nothing else we *can* do,” Qibli admitted, then glanced at the silver jeweled circlet adorning Winter’s head. “Oh, and you’ll need to lose the crown — ankle bag too.” He swiveled the satchel around his neck to Winter’s side and opened it.

“Excuse me?” Winter barked with the indignity and inflection only a royal could ever produce. “I most certainly will not!” He tilted his snout toward the sky with his usual haughty sneer.

With a quick sleight-of-talon, Winter’s pouch found its way onto Qibli’s claws. He hooked it onto a wing-talon, dangled it over his open satchel, then sharply whistled for Winter’s attention while wearing a very smug grin.

The IceWing’s disinterested scowl quickly vanished once he recognized it, even shooting a quick glance at his ankle out of disbelief. His dumbfounded eyes tracked the pouch perfectly as it gingerly plopped into Qibli’s satchel.

“Better hurry before someone else beats me to it,” Qibli added with a pleased chuckle.

Winter quickly dumped his silver tiara into the satchel and continued marching forward with a hilarious pout. “On second thought, I’m okay with the ‘you getting throttled’ part of the plan.”

“You’re joking, but that’s probably exactly what’s going to happen.”

The gateway to the town was strangely unguarded, which Thorn would have never allowed. Clearly, it was just the first of many changes that the den underwent after the Outclaws left for the Sand Palace.

The marketplace residing beyond the archway, however, seemed the same as Qibli remembered it. Ramshackle stalls strewn of palm wood and colorful cloth dotted the plaza enclosed by buildings of sandstone. Merchants shuffled out their inventory for display — all manner of assorted trinkets, weapons, or spices. The scent of tea and coffee swept through the air as barkeeps prepared the morning brew. It barely masked the faint miasma of sickness and death that permeated the town. 

Winter surveyed the plaza with a faint sneer, judging even the slightest bit of uncleanliness or impropriety. Already he was attracting suspicious glares from a few of the locals, which he appeared hopelessly oblivious to.

“Watch it!” jeered a cloaked SandWing as their shoulder bumped against Qibli’s. A lonely dragon-skull tattoo at the base of their neck greeted him before the cloaked figure swaggered away.

Qibli knew the game that was being played — luckily, he was better at it. He discretely patted his satchel: it felt as heavy as it should be, so nothing had been stolen. His talons produced a small gold coin, and he slipped it inside the pouch.

“This place seems so…” Winter tapered off as he mulled for the right word. 

“Charming? Full of character?” Qibli cheerfully offered.

“Destitute and unkempt.”

“I think you mean charming, though we are pretty unkempt,” Qibli said playfully, lightly jabbing Winter with his elbow. “I get it, though. Not used to life outside the prim and proper palaces yet. You’ll get there!”

“But not even Possibility was this unsanitary,” Winter remarked.

A part of Qibli felt a troubling hint of truth in Winter’s words. The Scorpion Den was always balanced precariously between two opposing forces. The Outclaws Thorn led through strength, courage, and compassion. Then there was the underworld filled with greed, corruption, and a whole lot of murder. The world Grandfather thrived in.

But with Thorn gone, what was keeping the underworld in check?

“Gah!” Winter yelped as something stopped him in his tracks. His right leg was caught in the grasp of a hobbled SandWing. A thin and frail figure with pale scales and festering sores barely covered by stained dressings. His eyes sullen and sunken, shooting the startled IceWing a despondent stare. 

“Please,” the SandWing pleaded, “any food or coin you can spare?”

Winter stood paralyzed; his jaw slack and his expression vacant. Qibli couldn’t tell if he took great offense over some dirty peasant thing daring to touch royalty, or if he was genuinely at a loss at what he should do. 

“I… Um…” Winter finally stammered out. 

“Here.” Qibli reached into his pouch and tossed the small gold coin toward the beggar. 

Immediately the SandWing’s eyes lit up; he hadn’t ever expected to be given even the slightest bit of kindness. That was probably why he went for Winter, he was very obviously an outsider.

The SandWing caught Qibli’s offering, briefly fumbling the coin before cupping it in his talons. “Th-thank you…” he said, talons trembling with gratitude, before returning to ogle at the coin.

Winter, meanwhile, had been vigorously wiping the smudge left on his leg. He grimaced at his open palm, which had collected some of the grime to his dismay. But as they left the beggar, he stared back at him with a ponderous expression then looked to Qibli.

“Nicked it off one of Vulture’s thugs back there,” Qibli answered before Winter could ask. “But I gotta know. Have you *ever* lived outside the Ice Palace before Jade Mountain? You looked as though you’ve never seen a dragon down on their luck before.”

“Only when I got kicked out for losing Hailstorm,” Winter said. “Lynx and her father let me stay with them at their estate until I was allowed back into the palace. I don’t think I’ve ever visited any of the villages though.”

The largest residential district of the den was just past the main plaza; colorful stalls and merchants gave way to featureless sandstone buildings and barely kept-together tents. Sun bleached scrawls of once mahogany paint were tucked away in the corners, some to mark territory and others left by dragonets for some long abandoned game. Buckets of sand lined some of the rooftops with simple levers to put out wayward fires. And several homeless dragons were scattered around; some half asleep in the gutter, others twitching about in their tents. 

There weren't this many before, from what Qibli remembered. Vulture certainly would let every other dragon wallow in suffering before he ever inconvenienced himself. The den was firmly worse off without Thorn. 

Despite that obvious fact, a comically large poster nailed to a nearby bulletin board displayed a defaced and unflattering portrait of the recently crowned queen. It lambasted her as a fraud, a failure, and claimed the Eye of Onyx to be a farce.

Winter’s disquieted expression fell as he surveyed the downtrodden dragons ahead, and his brow curled with revulsion. Qibli felt similarly appalled, though probably not for the same reasons.

“Queen Glacier would never allow something like this,” Winter grimly remarked.

“Thorn wouldn’t have left any of these dragons like this either,” Qibli pointed out.

“What’s stopping her?” Winter curtly said, narrowing his eyes. “IceWings take care of our own all across the kingdom.”

“As far as you know,” Qibli felt Winter’s words drive an icicle into his chest, creating a tightness he interpreted as anger. “And if forcing you to die in a cave for being a disappointment was their idea of ‘taking care of you’, then imagine how much worse regular IceWings have it.”

“That’s not what I meant! It’s just…” Winter squirmed, still swiping his smudged talon against the sand while they walked, as if that was equally important. “Thorn isn't some rogue or outlaw anymore, she’s the queen. Her tribe and kingdom are her responsibility now.”

“So every single IceWing in your oh-so-amazing kingdom has a home, is well-fed, and is perfectly taken care of?” Qibli whipped his tail, flicking a spray of sand at the IceWing. “I mean obviously you would know since you’ve spent so much time outside the palace.”

“We have the gift of subsistence, so at least no IceWing ever goes hungry like this,” Winter growled, tilting his head toward an unconscious SandWing slumped against the gutter as they passed him.

“MAGIC! Of course! The answer to everything!” Qibli nearly yelled, grinding himself to a halt. Images of Darkstalker’s scroll burning into a pile of ash flashed in front of him. “Well I hate to break this to you Prince Perfect, but not everyone has magic to solve all their problems.” 

*Thanks to you*.

Winter recoiled, nearly tripping over himself. He then circled around to face Qibli with widened eyes.

“You just don’t get it,” Qibli snarled, clenching the sand as if he were strangling it. “So stop pretending that you care.”

Winter was quiet for a long while. He furrowed his brow, his wings sagged closer to the ground. The anger bubbling within Qibli slowly simmered down as he intently examined the IceWing.

“Maybe you’re right,” Winter muttered, gazing woefully upon his dirty talons. “There’s probably a lot I don’t know about both of our kingdoms.”

This wasn’t the Winter that Qibli knew. The haughty IceWing prince — nephew to Queen Glacier — that he enjoyed teasing and prodding. Winter, who was always prideful and self-righteous and stubborn but still insufferably heroic behind it all. No, something about this Winter was getting under Qibli's scales, and he wasn't sure why. Perhaps because he wasn't acting predictably, or maybe Winter actually had a point. Had he truly changed, or was this Darkstalker's spell talking? 

Worst of all, Winter’s words kept repeating in his mind. Over and over again. Thorn was the SandWing queen. She doesn't operate in the Scorpion Den anymore, but isn’t there something she can do for the dragons here? And if so, why hasn’t she? 

*No. If there was, she would have done something already.* Qibli tried to reassure himself. *She is the best queen in all of Pyrrhia. She’d never let this happen if she could do something about it.*

“It’s fine,” Qibli hastily said, wanting to forget what had happened. “Let’s keep moving before we make a big scene.”

As they turned the corner to enter a cramped alleyway, Qibli caught a glimpse of shadows slinking behind them. They were being followed, as Qibli expected they would. Winter’s immaculately clean and sparkly scales, save for the now dirtied talons and smudged ankle, practically screamed “I’m a rich and easy mark”. But they hadn’t made a move yet, despite plenty of opportunities to. Qibli already had a run in with a cutpurse earlier, but they had been left alone since. No convenient dragonets running up to them to catch a stray toy ball. No aggressive passerby looking for a fight to size them up. Nothing — and that’s what worried Qibli the most.

Without a word, Qibli nudged Winter to keep moving. They continued through the alleyway and into the neighborhood that Qibli avoided for the past two years. 

The overwhelming scent of incense. The buzz of the flies that swarmed the communal dump. And ahead of them, the house that Qibli spent his earliest years in, cordoned off by a dilapidated black metal fence that looked more for show.

Painful memories threatened to break into Qibli's consciousness, and he reflexively snatched Winter’s talon to anchor himself in the present. The perturbed IceWing frowned at him, then yanked his talon away.

After a slow breath in, Qibli cautiously stepped through the open gate and into the courtyard where his siblings had tried to kill him hundreds of times. A gentle gust peppered the front of his snout with wayward grains of sand. The brown clay pots hanging from the windows held decaying plant matter, baked into dried lumps from the neglect, when they were once proudly bristling cacti. The sand kicked up from Qibli’s footfalls revealed the cobblestone walkway that led him to the shambling wood door.

After two years, Qibli thought he’d moved on from this part of his life. Yet here he was, buried in the terrified, groveling, helpless head-space he had grown up in.

*I don't have to go in if I can help it…* Qibli reminded himself. *But still, Mother…*

As he approached the front, Qibli heard a sharp sneeze from behind him. He hadn't been paying attention if Winter was even following, he was too preoccupied by the dizzying labyrinth of his memories.

Slowly, Qibli nudged the wooden door open and peered inside. Darkness swallowed everything several feet beyond the doorway. Every ounce of energy he had was then spent on pushing one single word out of his throat. 

“Mother?”

The heavy, foreboding silence inside smothered the sound of his voice.

“Oh… you lived… here?” Winter said carefully, examining the seemingly abandoned house. Qibli pretended he said that with pompous arrogance. It was more familiar — the good kind. The kind that Qibli needed right now.

*I can’t have those walls around me again*, Qibli shuddered. The rough smell of coriander seeds tugged at him.

“Mother?” he called once more.

Silence still, the darkness inside indifferent to his pleas.

*She’s all right*, Qibli told himself. *She’s one of the smartest and deadliest dragons in the Scorpion Den. She must have left long ago.*

*Or maybe Grandfather got to her, but he wouldn't…*

“She’s not here,” said a mocking voice behind him.

Winter and Qibli whirled around. Two dragons were perched on top of the courtyard walls, one on either side of them. Their venomous tails coiled carelessly over the edge beside them, both sharing malevolently delighted expressions. 

“Hello, Sirocco. Rattlesnake,” Qibli said, steeling his voice to sound calm. “Long time no see. You both look…” *even more cruel than before…* “older. Where is Mother?”

“Motha don’t want to see you no more,” Sirocco spat in his gravelly voice. 

Qibli spotted a trio of dragon-skull tattoos marching down the side of Sirocco’s neck as he whipped his gaze to his sister. Rattlesnake herself had five trailing from the corner of her left eye, almost like they were teardrops.

“But Grandfather does,” Rattlesnake announced in a menacing singsong. 

“Better come with us nice and quiet like,” Sirocco added. “He don’t like to wait.”

“Or you could…” Rattlesnake tittered like a hyena between sentences. “Fight back. That’d be lots more fun!” She flicked her forked tongue towards Winter. “Your shiny toy there looks like it’d make funny squeaks when it bleeds.”

Winter slitted his eyes at Rattlesnake, undeterred by her threats.

“Ruining your fun was always my specialty,” Qibli said with a strained chuckle, desperately trying not to sound like he was two years old all over again. The air around him felt oppressive, like it was about to crush him and all his cleverness into a fine paste. *I have animus friends and magic bracelets, I’m not the same weak and powerless dragon I was back then.* “I need to speak to Grandfather anyway. How is he? Is he still the same barrel of laughs he’s always been?”

“Come see for yourself,” Rattlesnake said, flicking her tail toward the alley they came from.

Qibli caught the sideways frown Winter sent his way and shrugged. This would get them into Grandfather’s compound, although he couldn’t guarantee they’d ever come out again.

His brother and sister led the way while Qibli and Winter followed close behind.

“So where *is* Mother, exactly?” Qibli asked.

“She’s… busy,” Sirocco droned.

“Let’s just say she hasn’t been the same since you abandoned us,” Rattlesnake hissed with a slimy smile.

“What does that mean?” Qibli asked.

“You’ll see,” sang Rattlesnake.

Qibli’s mind began churning with thoughts. *Mother regrets letting me go. So she does love me! Wait, no. She’ll probably be furious I’m back. Grandfather also knows I'm here, but how? Were Sirocco and Rattlesnake the ones trailing us? Was it because of that cut-purse earlier? Did Onyx guess I would come after Ostrich and was this all a setup? She’s not that smart, is she?*

*Also, how should I play this? I could pretend I'm here to rejoin the family. Grandfather wouldn’t believe it though. Maybe he wants something from me? But he probably won't let me leave, even without Ostrich. Maybe I can trick him into bringing her to me then we make a break for it? Would that be clever enough for Mother to notice? Will she think I'm interesting? What if they're all under Darkstalker’s spell too?*

Something tugged at Qibli’s neck while his mind sifted through the deluge of thoughts, and he stole a glance at Winter. The IceWing was clearly unhappy with the situation, his scowl fixed firmly ahead on Sirocco and Rattlesnake. He recalled an earlier idea he had for the earring and felt compelled to test it. 

With one quick swipe, weight shifted to his left talons, Qibli pulled out the spare amber earring from his satchel. He clenched it between his claws as he continued to follow without so much a stumble.

The two cactus-lickers, sharing Rattlesnake’s strawberry-sized brain between them, stopped at an intersection to bicker over which way to go next. 

With deft talons, Qibli pinned the earring to one of Winter’s dorsal scales. His tail mindlessly swept against his back, as if to shoo away whatever insect was responsible. Fortunately, the earring was safely obscured by the icicle-like spines surrounding it.

“So,” Qibli said, nudging his wing against Winter’s, “what do you think Moon and Turtle are up to?”

“Hm?” Winter dragged his attention, almost reluctantly, to Qibli. “I’m guessing they’re still in the Rainforest with Darkstalker.” He paused, then frowned. “Why? What’s gotten into you this time?”

“Just a bit worried about them is all,” Qibli said airily. “I mean, who wouldn’t be? With everything going on and a giant ancient super-powered NightWing hovering over them.”

“I’m not,” Winter declared with disappointing confidence. “They’ll be safe with Darkstalker around. Really, you should stop worrying about them. There’s nothing you can do to help them anyway.”

*The earring definitely isn't working*. *So it has to be worn on the ear.* Qibli also bit back the urge to yell at Winter for saying he couldn’t do anything to help Moon. The fear and helplessness he felt wriggled further into the wrinkles of his awareness, gripping ever so tighter with each minute he spent near his family.

“Whaddaya two on about?” Sirocco barked. 

“Oh we were just talking about how good the dragon-skull tattoos look on you,” Qibli lied with a mollifying grin. He almost choked holding back a violent retch in his throat.

“Oh hehehe. Got you jealous, don’t I!” Sirocco’s maw twisted into some semblance of a smile. 

“Shut it, dung-for-brains,” Rattlesnake hissed. “He was talkin’ about me, not your ugly mug. Now get a move on, all ya! Can’t keep the boss waiting.”

They turned down an alleyway that suddenly turned left, then right, then ended in a wall six dragons high. Sirocco pushed one of the bricks, grabbed the revealed handle, and slid open the secret door to Grandfather’s compound. One by one, they filed into the cramped, dimly lit tunnel.

A few twists and turns later, the tunnel finally opened up to an extravagant lobby. An ostentatious display of decadence, lavishly decorated with an assorted menagerie of art, silk, and golden treasures displayed on pedestals. The only marble in this region of the kingdom tiled the floor, with intricate designs and patterns drawn with gold. 

Neither Thorn nor any of her Outclaws had ever set foot into Vulture’s compound. But Qibli had been here a few times when he was young. Mostly for family gatherings pertaining to their criminal enterprises. But this place seemed more excessive than what he remembered. Or perhaps he’d grown to appreciate simplicity while living with Thorn.

They turned the corner at the end of the foyer and approached a massive, emerald-studded set of double doors. Golden SandWing statues with black-diamond eyes and gaping maws, as if they were silently roaring, lined the short hallway that led to it. Winter probably hadn’t noticed, but they were standing in one of the compound's many traps. The doors behind them, although propped open now, could snap shut and the dragon statues could emit a poisonous gas.

*Some of those diamond eyes seem loose. Could probably sell those for a good amount*, Qibli thought. The entire compound was a complete waste of wealth. Wealth that could help the many impoverished dragons suffering right on Vulture’s doorstep. 

But stealing from Vulture would mean certain death. And as far as Qibli knew, no one had ever gotten away with it.

As Sirocco and Rattlesnake pushed the grandiose doors open, Qibli could feel the scorn emanating from his IceWing friend. He hoped Winter could contain his haughty arrogance in front of Grandfather. He hoped he wasn’t leading the two of them into an ambush. He could probably leverage his royalty as a deterrent, so long as Vulture wasn’t aware of Winter’s supposed death.

“Let me do all the talking,” Qibli whispered to Winter.

“That's usually how conversations with you go anyway,” Winter observed.

The pavilion beyond the doors was laden with pillars of marble. Turquoise and ruby gemstones dotted the columns with spiral patterns, and scarlet silk tapestry draped the archways bridging each pillar. The ceiling itself was a dome set with mirrors, reflecting light from a few small lanterns to brightly illuminate the center of the circular room.

 A few cloaked dragons lurked around the pillars, and nestled right in the center of the room was Qibli’s grandfather. 

Vulture’s long neck and hooked snout hovered over a wooden box. Empty black eyes, like bottomless pits devoid of any light, examined the structure as he slouched comfortably upon his cushioned dais. He had added to his collection of dragon-skull tattoos, at this point almost looking like a spotted leopard, with pale-yellow scales weaving between jagged splotches of black. He wore a black cloak with gold lining, wings draped with gold chains. His claws were dipped with gold lead, and enormous gold-black earrings shaped like spiders gleamed in his ears. 

He didn’t look up as Qibli and Winter approached. Beside him were four other dragons, one of which was a garishly decorated MudWing, who were also focused on the structure in front of them. It was a little maze, Qibli realized as he drew closer. And inside were two scavengers scrambling in a panic from one dead end to another. 

*Oh no— Winter please don't react…*

Winter drew a sharp gasp and took a step forward. Qibli quickly blocked him with his wing, but the noise was enough to make Vulture look up. 

“Qibli,” he said with the most crooked smile. “So it seems you’ve finally come to your senses.”",1,1751566417.0,WingsOfFire,0,1.0,False

My boyfriend and I were in an argument and didn’t speak or see each other for a week. When we did see each other we hung out for a bit and then he went to his place and said he wanted to stay the night alone. He asked me if it was ok and I said yes. I was ok with it in the moment. But as i thought about it I realized that I wasn’t ok with it. 

The next morning he came over and brought me a coffee and I asked him he why he didn’t want to stay together. He said he knew it was gonna be an issue and got mad. He said we just hadn’t seen each other for a week and he wanted to ease into it and just wanted to sleep in his own bed. 

I don’t get it. I feel like he didn’t want to spend time with me. I take it personally. 

He says I’m controlling and hard to deal with. 
Among other character attacking slurs. 

I think there’s an underlying issue that he’s not being honest about. 

We have been together 4 years and we live walking distance apart. I’m lost with how to communicate with h or be ok with having expectations or even saying how I feel. I feel like no matter how I say it it blows up into an argument.

I know it’s been over a year na, and fuck it, I told myself I wouldn’t write anything about you again but here I am, standing at the grave of what we left behind.
I thought I could completely forget you. I thought the pain was gone. But the ache is still here, and I’m starting to think na baka hindi na talaga ito mawawala.

A couple of months ago, we met for closure. I agreed because I believed I had finally left the past behind. That this would just be a friendly meeting. Chill lang ganon and just meeting up casually. Ang tapang ko pa pumasok sa coffee shop that we had agreed to meet up. But the moment I saw you, I knew I had made a mistake. You still looked the same. We still talked the same way we used to. We still shared the same likes and dislikes. You can still make me laugh, and it fucking sucks. But the difference was this time, we were just two ordinary people with a history I can’t seem to forget.

I know deep down that it’s truly over. There’s nothing left to expect, and our story has reached its end. There will be no sequel, because there’s no plot left to continue. And honestly, I can’t afford to relive the same ending we already had. And that ending shattered my heart into millions of pieces that I can’t find until now.
I miss the memories. I miss the illusion of you that I created in my mind. I miss the feelings, the laughter, the warmth that came with that illusion. But I know that person is gone—long gone. What’s left is you. Just you. And you’re not the person I once loved. You are someone entirely different, and I don’t miss you, I miss him. Too bad he’s dead, along with the memories I miss most.
If we ever come across each other again, I know looking at you will only make me miss him. And you’re not him, and I can’t trust this version of you.

Rest in peace, my great, lost love. You will always have a part of my heart. I loved you so much that it left a crater I know time can never mend. Maybe in a different reality across the universe, somehow, you chose to fight for me…",1,1751566260.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

I started this year at my heaviest ever — 294 lbs (135 kg) — with a crazy shift job, zero gym, barely sleeping, and a 3-year-old daughter I was afraid I wouldn’t keep up with.  
I decided to just stop eating at work (just coffee/water), eat only 1-2 high-protein, low-carb meals at home (mostly keto-ish), and walked 13–20k steps a day in the factory, lifting heavy iron plates.
No calorie counting, no personal trainer, just consistency and cutting all the junk.

Now, after 5 months, I’m down 53 lbs (24 kg).  
I feel better, but I’m left with some loose skin around my stomach and chest. I know it’s early, but it’s kinda discouraging when the fat is mostly gone but the skin just hangs.

**Anyone with similar experience?**  
*Is there anything that can actually help the skin tighten up (besides surgery)?*

I tried 4 different BC pills over several years, nothing worked. I had breakthrough bleeding, developed cystic acne, irregular periods etc. Finally caved and got the Kyleena IUD. It was fine for 2.5 years then I got a UTI. Followed by a yeast infection. Went for my annual a few months later and had BV (no symptoms). Then came the next 2 years when I had 2 more UTIs, 3 more yeast infections, and one more case of BV. Finally I was convinced it was my IUD. I had it removed--to which the doctor said I had signs of sterile inflammation, a lot of mucus, and that would explain the change in smell and discharge that I noticed after getting the IUD 4 years prior (my doctor that put it in said IUDs couldn't cause the changes I noticed).

While having the IUD, and after my first UTI, I noticed that I felt pelvic pressure randomly that almost felt like a full bladder but sometimes it wasn't, like someone was pressing my stomach and I had to pee. This feeling went away after removing the IUD (which I wholeheartedly thought had caused kidney/bladder issues)

I felt amazing after removing the IUD--pelvic pressure gone, normal smell and discharge. I tried the mini pill which ended up causing horrible anxiety so now I'm BC free.

The first two months on the mini pill following the IUD removal were normal. Then I noticed I felt swollen, irritated, and burning/itching down there (almost like a sandpaper feeling). Sometimes this was accompanied by the full bladder/pressure feeling and an urgency to pee, which was extremely frustrating because I sometimes couldn't pee when I knew I had to. This would last for a few days to a week and come and go 1-2 times a month. This entire time I would go to the doctor and get tested for UTIs, yeast, BV. All of which were negative. She had no other explanation and finally I was in and out of the office so much she tested for ureaplasma/micoplasma--also negative.

STD panels were negative, I am hygienic, drink 80-100 ounces of water a day, eat relatively healthy and take a daily probiotic. I wear cotton underwear that I change throughout the day and sleep without anything. I have one consistent monogamous partner who was there years before these issues arised. Recently we treated him for yeast and BV just to make sure this wasn't something we were sharing. We have refrained from sex to see if that is what's affecting me but these symptoms persists regardless.

I asked the doctor if this could be a hormonal imbalance, a pelvic floor issue, a kidney/bladder issue, a vitamin deficiency. All of which she disregarded and said it might go away with time.

Tested my hormones and estrogen was low--but she said it didn't matter even tho she commented multiple times it was lower than she'd like to see. She said we would do the process of elimination but refused to do anything other than swab tests. Since stopping all BC I have had 2 more yeast infections and one more case of BV, but usually these symptoms test negative.

I found a new doctor, who won't do a hormone test and insists if I have these feelings it has to be an infection or it's anxiety making me feel this way. I'm negative every time I'm tested. She did a vitamin test and I had slightly low vitamin D levels. I had, prior to this, been putting soy milk in my coffee and taking vitamin b12 complex and vitamin c. But this doctor told me not to take any vitamins because vitamin c can cause kidney stones.

I had 3 months of relief (which I wasn't sure was due to trying to incorporate foods with natural forms of phytoestrogens or not) and now these symptoms are back again. It's affecting all aspects of my life and I'm genuinely worried something is wrong with me. I feel this was all caused by IUD.

Whatever happens during discovery tends to cascade right down the rest of the sales process like dominoes. 

Therefore, the type of questions that you ask at this stage are important. So, lets say you're selling for an air-conditioning company and you get speaking to a decision maker. It's going to be very tempting to ask questions like ""Is your air-conditioning system working optimally?"" 

However, this is a business question. **This is not the way humans really speak over a cup of coffee in their canteen on a Tuesday afternoon.** 

Instead, ask a question such as ""Hey, I bet your AC system is working overtime in these conditions. Do you think it's working well?""

  
Why is the second approach different?

a) It's **human sounding** 

b) It's asking **their opinion**. People love talking about what they think is good, bad or indifferent.  

**Bottom Line:** Ask your prospects how they **think** and **feel** about their current solution but whatever you do ditch the fact-based questions because you're only likely to get an equally robotic answer. ",2,1751565866.0,sales,0,1.0,False
1lqweul,https://www.reddit.com/r/studypartner/comments/1lqweul/just_wanted_to_share_some_possible_help_killer/,"Just wanted to share some possible help, Killer Papers helped me with my grades","YourAcademicWriter Review (2025): Is It Legit or Just Homework Hype?
Alright, confession time! 
I tried out YourAcademicWriter when I was neck-deep in assignments and needed a quick fix. I’d seen it floating around online, and the name sounded trustworthy enough. But after actually using it, I knew I had to write this YourAcademicWriter review so y’all don’t waste your time (or your GPA).
TL/DR: 
I gave YourAcademicWriter a shot and ended up regretting it. The writing was sloppy, the communication was vague and the end result was barely usable. I’ve been using Killer Papers ever since and honestly wish I’d found them first 😕
Why I Chose YourAcademicWriter in the First Place
It was midterms week, I had three major assignments due, and I was running on catnaps and way too much coffee. And redbull (can’t forget that). I did a quick Google search for “essay help” and “homework access,” and YourAcademicWriter popped up high in the results. The site looked decent, the prices were on the lower end, and they promised fast turnaround.
I figured, why not? I was desperate and just needed something to hand in and I was almost broke.
My Experience Using YourAcademicWriter
Ordering was fairly straightforward. I picked a “premium” writer and paid extra for a “plagiarism-free guarantee” and early delivery. Everything seemed smooth… until the essay came back.
The paper felt robotic and kind of disjointed. Like it was copy-pasted from different sources and strung together with AI or something. There were no transitions between the ideas at all. It barely addressed my topic, and some of the grammar was straight-up confusing. It also included random paragraphs about stuff that didn’t relate to my thesis at all. When I asked for a revision, they gave me the runaround for two days and then sent back a paper that was a bit better, but in a half-hearted kind of way.
Also, I requested APA formatting, and it was this weird Frankenstein mix of MLA and hyperlinks. Didn’t help that when I checked it through Turnitin, it flagged 28% similarity. Yikes😱
What Changed When I Switched to Killer Papers
After THAT mess, I went into Reddit deep-dive mode and saw a few people mentioning Killer Papers. The big sell for me? They don’t use AI or outsource overseas. They use actual North American writers, and it showed. Oh boy, the difference was insane.
I tried them for my next class assignment, and the experience was a complete 180. The writer reached out to ask about my major and tone preferences, the paper came back clean, insightful, and 100% original (Turnitin score was under 3% and that was just the APA template where my details are supposed to go). They even nailed my professor’s quirky formatting preferences (she wants page numbers for EVERYTHING, ALL THE TIME). 
Killer Papers also offers true homework access through their writers. You can send them your class portal or files and they’ll actually go through the materials to craft the paper around the course: none of that cookie-cutter generic BS.
They’re not the cheapest option (seriously, I coughed and accidentally snorted some coffee), but honestly? The peace of mind and quality was WORTH IT. I’d rather spend a bit more upfront than scramble to fix a half-baked essay an hour before it’s due (ask me how I know 😖).
Final Thoughts
If you're wondering is YourAcademicWriter legit?, based on my experience, I’d say tread carefully. It might work for someone just looking to check a box, but if you care about your grades or need something properly academic, I’d look elsewhere.
Personally, Killer Papers has been my go-to ever since that first disaster. Real writers, no AI junk, reliable homework access, and consistently solid results. You can’t really ask for more. And how responsive the writers are is unparalleled.
TL/DR:
 This YourAcademicWriter review is based on my real experience: rushed work, poor writing, and a waste of time. Switched to Killer Papers and finally got the quality that I needed.

Looking to move to Denver in the next few months and seeking some neighborhood advice. I'm single, 30F, and have a small dog and really love smaller/cozier neighborhoods than ones that are very urban with high rises. I would love tree lined streets, some walkability (coffee shop, a bar or two, maybe a gym or something, farmers market, etc but I absolutely do not need to be in the hustle and bustle of it all), and walking distance to some larger green space. I'm coming from DC and have lived in major east coast cities for my entire 20's so I am looking for something relatively calmer but not ready for suburbs yet. I will be working hybrid but only will need to get to the office downtown 2x a week. I was originally thinking Capitol hill but since I don't need to be in the office that much I think I would prefer being on the west side of i25 for closer access to the mountains, so now I'm thinking Sloans Lake. My budget can go upwards of 1800ish but ideally I would like to spend less than that and I don't need a new building with a bunch of amenities.

The children she risked her life to bear said, “Auntie is way better than Mother!”

For six years, she cared for them without complaint, yet in their eyes, she was just the help.

He was her youthful obsession, but his constant favoritism toward another woman finally woke her up.

He never loved her. To him, she was just a tool—to give him heirs.

And what broke her completely…

Was her children’s cold, cruel words:

“We hate you. We always will.”

None of them loved her.

They only loved her.

So this time, she chose to walk away—

And live for herself, at last.#####Chapter 1

Sophia ran a manicured finger along the rim of her tea cup, brows knitting tight.

“What’s your angle, Emily?”

Emily’s face was unreadable. “No angle. I’m just tired.”

“Do you have any idea how many women would kill to be in your shoes?”

“Oh, I do,” Emily said, meeting her gaze. “That’s why I’m handing them over.”

That did it. A flicker of panic cracked through Sophia’s cool exterior. She stared at the papers for a long beat… then picked them up.

“Well then. Since you’re being so generous, I won’t say no.”

She glanced up, voice low and smug.

“But just so we’re clear—I don’t give back what’s mine.”

Emily gave a faint smile. “Good. I won’t be asking.”

She’d already lived a lifetime full of loneliness and regret.

Sophia stood and strolled to another table, took out her phone, and tapped a few times with that dainty, practiced elegance of hers.

When the call connected, her voice switched from smug to syrupy sweet.

“Ethan? I’m at Willow Grove Café. Can you come pick me up?”

Emily sat in the corner, lips curled into a bitter smile.

She remembered the days she’d call him—ten times out of ten, his assistant picked up.

But now?

Not twenty minutes later, the man who was always “in a meeting” walked through the door like the world had stopped turning just for her.

Through the glass, Emily saw him. Ethan Caldwell. Six-foot-two in a custom black suit that fit like sin, sharp jaw, colder eyes. A man born to command.

Their six-year-old son Lucas and four-year-old daughter Lily ran straight into Sophia’s arms like she was their world.

“Auntie Sophia!” Lily squealed, nuzzling against her thorax like a kitten.

Ethan set a box on the table and nudged it toward Sophia with a single elegant gesture.

“Vanilla bean. Had the chef cut the sugar—just how you like it.”

Her eyes lit up. “You always remember the little things.”

Emily sat there, fists clenched in her lap.

Six years of marriage. Ethan never once asked what cake she liked.

The one time she was hospitalized and craving strawberry shortcake, he had his assistant grab something “close enough.” It was peach. She was allergic.

“What do you feel like for dinner?” Ethan’s voice was low, almost intimate. “French? Italian?”

Sophia smiled and pulled something from her purse.

“Before that, there’s something I need you to take a look at.”

She flipped to the last page of the divorce papers.

“There’s a villa I’ve had my eye on, but I’m a little short on liquid funds. Could you…?”

Ethan took the pen and signed without so much as glancing at it.

“You and me—no need to keep score.”

Lucas looked up at Sophia, eyes wide.

“You’re getting a new house, Auntie Sophia? Father, can we get one next door? Me and Lily wanna live with her. We’re tired of being at mother’s all the time.”

Ethan hesitated for half a second, then caved when he saw the kids’ hopeful faces.

“Sure. We’ll look into it.”

“No need for all that,” Sophia said sweetly. “I’ll just save a few rooms for you and the kids. You’re always welcome.”

The children whooped with joy.

Lily wrapped her arms around Sophia’s neck and kissed her cheek.

“You’re the best, Auntie Sophia! Way better than mother!”

Emily felt something twist violently in her thorax.

She glanced at Ethan.

He was smiling. Smiling in a way she had never seen him smile at her.

That was enough. She stood up, grabbed her bag, and walked out the door without looking back.

As soon as the cold air hit her face, memories from her previous life came flooding in.

She’d married Ethan in a business deal. They’d had two kids. She lived to sixty-two—but she was never happy.

Because from beginning to end, Ethan only loved one woman: Sophia Bennett.

Back then, after Sophia left the country, Ethan drank himself sick for a few days. But pride kept him from chasing after her. When the families arranged a merger, he said yes without hesitation.

To Emily, Ethan had been her teenage dream. The untouchable prince of Sterling Heights. Every girl in high society wanted him.

So when her family announced the engagement, she’d felt like she’d won the lottery.

But after the wedding, she poured everything into their marriage… and got nothing back.

And then Sophia returned.

Ethan didn’t file for divorce. He didn’t need to. He never looked at Emily again.

Even worse, the kids—her kids—started drifting toward Sophia too.

Years later, Emily was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Ethan claimed it was “for her peace of mind” when he sent her away to the Caldwell estate, alone.

On her birthday, she called her husband and children—only to find out they were in the Maldives with Sophia.

She tried making herself a bowl of birthday noodles—a tradition her mother used to keep, long before everything fell apart.

But she forgot to turn off the stove.

As the flames closed in around her, the only thing she could see were Ethan’s cold, indifferent eyes—the same eyes he had when he slid the wedding ring onto her finger.

In that final, burning moment, she wished for just one thing: a second chance.

A second chance at life—one where she didn’t waste her heart, her youth, and her soul on a man who never loved her back.

\----

Back at the villa, it was already dark.

But Emily didn’t rest. She started packing.

Ethan’s suits. The kids’ toys. Framed family photos. Into boxes they went, one by one.

“What the heck are you doing?” Ethan’s voice rang out behind her.

She turned. He stood in the doorway, both kids in tow, scowling.

“Why is mother throwing away our stuff?” Lily ran to the boxes, saw her teddy bear inside, and burst into angry tears. “That’s my bear!”

Lucas glared. “We just hung out with Auntie Sophia. Why are you being so dramatic?”

Ethan crossed his arms. His tone was cold as ever.

“The kids like Sophia. You’re really throwing a fit over that?”

“I’m not angry,” Emily said quietly.

“Liar!” Lily screamed. “You’re just jealous of Auntie Sophia! You’re the worst mother ever!”

“I’m gonna live with Auntie Sophia forever!” Lucas snapped, grabbing his sister’s hand. “We’ll never come back here!”

Ethan said nothing. He didn’t correct them. Didn’t even look at her.

He adjusted his sleeve like none of it concerned him.

“That’s enough. I’ve got a board meeting. Pack whatever you want. Just don’t make a mess.”

As the door clicked shut, Emily’s tears finally fell.

Her thorax felt like it had been ripped apart. Every breath hurt like inferno.

She wiped her eyes, looked at the mess around her…

And laughed.

It’s okay.

She won’t bother him again.

Not ever.

\#####Chapter 2

Ever since Ethan signed the divorce agreement, Emily had stopped pretending.

She no longer woke up at five every morning to make the kids a healthy breakfast.

No more waiting up past midnight to fix Ethan his hangover soup after another late-night “business dinner.”

All the little things she used to do—things she once thought were her duty as a wife and mother—she handed them off to the staff without a second thought.

At first, no one noticed the shift.

But then small cracks started to show.

Lucas showed up late to school and got a warning from his teacher.

Lily couldn’t find her homework.

Ethan’s prized pocket watch stopped ticking.

The housekeepers scrambled to keep up, but nothing was ever quite right.

The kitchen sink overflowed with dirty dishes.

Toys littered the living room like landmines.

And Ethan’s shirts? Always just a little wrinkled, never quite crisp enough.

The once spotless house—once run like clockwork under Emily’s quiet hands—was slowly falling apart at the seams.

—

When Ethan pushed open the bedroom door, he found Emily by the window, bathed in the soft spill of afternoon sun, a book resting gently in her lap.

He didn’t step inside. Just stood there, voice low and sharp.

“How long are you planning to keep this up?”

Emily closed the book and met his gaze.

“I’m not doing anything.”

“Then why aren’t you taking care of things around here?” He walked a few steps closer, that faint scent of his cologne—rich and familiar—trailing behind him. “Still mad about last time?”

“I’m not mad,” she said simply. “I just don’t care anymore.”

Ethan narrowed his eyes, tapping a knuckle against the edge of her desk.

“Why?”

“I’m tired.” Her voice was calm, eerily so. “We’ve got staff. Let them earn their pay.”

Her mind flashed back to her past life. The one she had barely survived.

She used to get up before sunrise. Ethan’s coffee had to be exactly 185 degrees. His sandwich toasted to a perfect golden crisp.

The kids’ clothes? Hand-washed, socks pressed flat like store displays.

And for what?

For Ethan’s tenderness—all of it reserved for Sophia.

For her kids’ growing attachment to “Auntie Sophia.”

For a lonely, forgotten death on her sixty-second birthday.

Ethan’s tone turned colder.

“If you’re gonna throw a tantrum, at least own it. Don’t act like a sulky child.”

Emily gave a tired smile. “I’m not throwing a tantrum. I’m taking a break.”

Before the words even left her mouth, the door burst open.

Lucas and Lily stormed in, little faces full of fire.

“mother’s just lazy!” Lily shrieked. “We want Auntie Sophia to take care of us!”

“She’s nicer than you! She works harder! She’s a million times better than you!” Lucas added, his voice echoing through the room.

Ethan kept his eyes locked on Emily like he was waiting for her to crack.

But she just inhaled slowly and said, almost in a whisper, “If you all think she’s better, then bring her here. I won’t stop you.”

Silence fell like a hammer.

Ethan’s expression darkened.

“You sure about that?”

Emily didn’t flinch.

“Dead sure.”

“Father, let’s go!” Lily grabbed Ethan’s sleeve, jumping with excitement. “I want Auntie Sophia to come right now!”

“We don’t need you anymore!” Lucas stuck out his tongue at her, fists clenched. “Go away! Leave this house already!”

Ethan looked at her one last time. Her face was still, unreadable. She didn’t blink.

He turned away without a word.

And just like that, he left—with both kids in tow.

Emily stayed where she was, listening to the sound of the engine fading into the distance.

She closed her eyes.

It wouldn’t be long now.

Soon, they’d get exactly what they wanted.

She’d leave.

Took 2 cups, filled one up w 1inch ice cubes (a lottle above the rim like coffe shops do) and one with 1\2inch cubes. But actual cube shaped. Filled the cups with water, then poured out the water to measure volume. It was very very very  close. 

Initially i thought the large ice cubes would allow for more coffe ebcause they are less able to settle, so less volume of ice can be put in a cup. I was basing my theory on volume of basketball in a shipping container versus marbles. Thinking the empty space is greater from basketballs. But maybe it is fairly equal because of how similar shapes settle into a space. 

Long story short, has anybody seen math problems that deal with this type of scenario? I would love to learn more about this type of math!

I landed in America early to check out the city of my program. I cannot access my school's career services yet, so I found some incoming 2nd years willing to do some career coaching. I want to aim for consulting.

The only issue is that multiple 2nd years I did coffee chats with mentioned they noticed a body odor issue on me. They told me as a way to be kind so that I don't face social difficulties on campus and also during interviews and on the job. One doing their Bain summer internship in the same city said consulting is very image conscious and body odor will significantly limit advancement or can get you fired. Some of the 2nd years who told me this were female, others were male.

The good thing is I'm glad these classmates gave me this feedback. However, I legitimately have never heard this feedback before, so it was surprising and new to me. I do shower regularly. In my home country we don't use deodorant (we call it ""deo"") a ton, it's a cultural issue and different hygiene norms. So I will definitely purchase that. Does anyone have good recommendations?

I also just learned of something called ""antiperspirant."" My location has quite hot summers so I should likely purchase that.

The other question is cologne. Is that worth purchasing? Some people have said if you have body odor, cologne just makes things way worse. But what if you pair it with anti perspirant or deodorant? What is a good pairing?

The last thing is sadly I think much of the smell isn't hygiene related but food related. My culture's cooking uses a lot of spices and flavorful smells that may be unfamiliar to Westerners, and that gets on our clothes as well as comes out during our pores and sweat glands. We use a lot of cumin, coriander, garlic, and onions in our cuisine.

I don't want to have to stop eating my culture's cuisine. So does anyone have any advice how to handle that?

It also seems working out and trimming / shaving body hair can help mitigate bad odors.

I'm serious about fixing this issue ASAP before starting on campus and it seems to be a common one for certain internationals, so would love any help I can get :) And yes, heard things from Chat GPT but love asking real people in the community.",0,1751565186.0,MBA,8,0.4,False

1lqw52s,https://www.reddit.com/r/yellowstone/comments/1lqw52s/8_full_days_in_yellowstone_gtnp_itinerary_for/,8 Full Days in Yellowstone & GTNP Itinerary for Families,"We recently returned from an 8 day trip to YNP & GTNP, sharing our itinerary to help others plan.  We traveled with two children, ages 8 and 9.  **This is a long post**, but I hope it helps someone with planning!  We traveled from 6/20/25 thru 6/28/25.  We flew with a 4-day Igloo cooler as checked luggage (we packed it with all our hiking boots, and secured it with a luggage strap).  The cooler was perfect to pack our food essentials to have picnic lunches everyday.  There were plenty of places to fill water bottles and get ice along the way.

**#1 tip:** Download offline maps in your maps App on iPhone so you can find wherever you need to go even if you don't have cell service (which we found was most of the time while we were out and about).  This was the number one thing that I would suggest you absolutely do before you leave.

**Day 1: YNP:** Fly into Bozeman, MT.  Picked up rental car, picked up bear spray from kiosk at Bozeman Chamber of Commerce (get some free stickers here for the kids!), and food shopping at Walmart in Bozeman-- then drove to Mammoth.  Once we checked into Mammoth Hotel, we went to dinner at the Terrace Grill and enjoyed the Mammoth Hot Springs in the evening.  Cabin was not great- quite shabby with exposed openings all around the actual door frame.  I was surprised there weren't more bugs or creatures in our room to be honest.  We didn't do much else the first day since everyone was exhausted from traveling as we flew in from New England.

**Day 2: YNP:** Check out of hotel.  Sit down breakfast at Mammoth Dining room.  We were planning to drive out to Blacktail Plateau Drive for wildlife viewing, however the road was closed.  We continued on and drove out to Lamar Valley, saw plenty of bison, elk, even black bears (up in the trees!), and a bald eagle.  From here, we kept driving and stopped over at Mud Volcanos and attended an impromptu Ranger Talk and did the small boardwalk-hike around.  We then did a stagecoach ride at the Roosevelt Corral (honestly I could take it or leave it) but our kids loved it because they got to ride ""tally ho"".  We had a picnic lunch, then stopped over at the Tower Falls General store to do the Tower Falls Hike (and followed it all the way to the river at the very bottom- absolutely worth it!).  We stopped at the General Store for ice cream (fantastic).  From here we continued driving till we got to Canyon Village which is where we would spend the night for Day 2 and Day 3.  Dinner at Canyon Lodge Eatery.  (**Note:** while we traveled, all of the park ""grab & go"" dining options were super limited because food deliveries hadn't come in yet).

**Day 3: YNP:** Canyon Lodge Eatery for breakfast.  We initially had a lot of hiking planned for this day, however the entire day it was snowing and frigid, so we had to wing it.  First we drove out to Hayden Valley for wildlife viewing strictly from the car and drove all the way out to Fishing Bridge right off Grand Loop Road.  On our way back towards Canyon Village, we stopped at Artist Point and then drove over to North Rim Drive and did the Brink of Lower Falls hike (highly recommend).  We followed the trail to Lookout Point then walked back to the parking lot at Brink of Lower Falls.  Finally, we drove to Inspiration Point for the scenic view.  Later in the afternoon, we attempted to do the Virginia Cascades Drive, however with the snow, we were unable to see anything.  Dinner again at the Canyon Lodge Eatery.

**Day 4: YNP:** Check out of hotel, Canyon Lodge Eatery for breakfast.  Before heading to our first stop, we did the Virginia Cascade Drive again (since we couldn't see anything the previous day) and it was lovely.   Next stop, Norris Geyser Basin.  We did the whole thing and it was amazing-- I wouldn't miss this!  I recommend doing the longer loop first and then ending with Porcelain Basin (which is the show stopper).   Try to get there before 9:30/10:00AM-- the parking lot is extremely busy!  Afterwards, we stopped at Gibbons Meadows for a picnic lunch.  After leaving the picnic area, we headed towards Midway Geyser Basin and Fountain Paint Pot-- but at this point, the after lunch time traffic was outrageous!  We had to make a call, and we skipped Midway Geyser Basin & Fountain Paint Pot and instead headed directly to Fairy Falls Trailhead to see Grand Prismatic Spring.  Parking here was a nightmare-- there are tons of signs that say ""No Buses/RVs/Campers"" and the parking lot was full of these vehicles trying to park there-- it's a small and narrow parking lot-- we wished it had been monitored to help the parking process since so many people didn't follow the rules-- it was a huge contributing factor to the traffic.  Anyways, we hiked up to the scenic viewpoint and Grand Prismatic was incredible.  We also happened to be there the day after a poor bison walked into the spring and passed away-- his body was floating in the spring and was visible from the lookout point.  From here we continued our drive to Old Faithful and checked into our cabin.  We had dinner reservations at the Old Faithful Inn Dining Room (this was EASILY our best meal the entire trip), and afterwards ended our night with watching Old Faithful erupt before bed.

**Day 5: YNP:** Checked out of Old Faithful cabin and went to the Snow Lodge for breakfast.  We then hiked up the Observation Point Trail to watch Old Faithful erupt again.  From here we continued on towards the Upper Geyser Hill Trail to get to Morning Glory, however the trail was closed somewhere around Grand Geyser.  Since it was getting late in the morning and we didn't have time to double back and go all the way around, we decided to skip Morning Glory.  We then walked to the Old Faithful Visitor Center/Education Center while people were lining up to watch Old Faithful erupt-- it was perfect- we had the whole education center to ourselves and walked around and learned quite a bit before the crowd came bursting in.  We left Old Faithful area soon after, did another picnic lunch in the car, and drove out to West Thumb Geyser Basin.  We attended a Ranger Talk here at the Abyss Pool (which was awesome) but did not complete the whole loop around- at this point the kids were exhausted!  We continued driving **ending our day in GTNP** and checked in to Jackson Lake Lodge.  At the point, after lots of research, we were lead to believe there were laundry services at this hotel so we were pretty disappointed 5 days into our trip that we were not able to get this service.  So after dinner at the Mural Room (kids didn't really care for this place) I went to Colter Bay myself to the laundromat while kids and husband took advantage of the pool at Jackson Lake Lodge.

**Day 6: GTNP:** Grab & go breakfast and headed to Jenny Lake.  The parking here is no joke- seriously get here before 8:30/9:00AM or you're going to be parking way down the road.  We bought tickets at the boat dock to take a round trip ferry to the west shore.  There was a short line to wait to get over there- maybe 15min.  Once on the west shore, we hiked up to Inspiration Point.  From here, we hiked an additional 1 mile into Cascade Canyon, but with the high altitude, our kids were getting beat very quickly so we turned back, hit up Hidden Falls and went back to the boat dock.  By this point, it was about 1 or 2pm and the wait for the ferry ride back was approximately 45min-- we were NOT expecting this, so I would keep that in mind!  On our drive back to Jackson Lake Lodge, we stopped at Teton Glacier Turnout, but our views during our hike were just as good- if not- better than this turnout.  We had dinner at the Pioneer Grill (just OK).

**Day 7: GTNP:** Grab & go breakfast then headed to Jackson for a classic whitewater rafting excursion on Snake River.  We did this through the company Teton Whitewater.  This was incredible and a highlight for our kids- they never wanted it to end.  When leaving Jackson, we found a spot to return our Bear Spray. We ate lunch in the car and then hit up Mormon Row.  Our kids didn't really care for this, but I loved it and found it very interesting.  For dinner, we went to the John Colter Ranch House, which was just OK.

**Day 8: GTNP:** Sit down breakfast at the Pioneer Grill.  Then we drove out to Oxbow Bend to see wildlife.  There was a Ranger parked here showing grizzly bear skin, coyote and a river otter skins.  He even had a telescope set up on an osprey nest which was cool.  We got grab & go lunch from the coffee cart back at the lodge and then drove over to Colter Bay for a 1 hour horseback ride (another highlight of our trip!)  The rest of the afternoon we enjoyed time in the pool and had dinner at Leeks Marina pizza place (not that good).

Then we flew home the next day from Jackson Hole airport.  So we had about 4.5 days at YNP and a good 3 full days at GTNP.  As others mention, the food in the parks is not great and there are not a lot of options and it's incredibly expensive.  We were happy with our traveling pace and felt we hit up almost all the major sites in YNP.  GTNP we felt like we just scratched the surface- there is much more hiking and things to see than what we were able to do in our short time, but we still thoroughly enjoyed.

I hope this helps anyone out in their trip planning and happy travels!

Tips,"Have any of you taken this class? What subtle things could I mention that could get him thinking? Like, what even is this class? Is it just fluff or does it actually talk about stuff now mentioned in the GTEs? I have already told him about many things, and also shared my anguish with him of how this church has destroyed the person of faith I was before becoming lds. He is pretty open minded (he's buying me my coffee today), given he is also a convert like me (we both joined when we were teens), but he still has a really strong testimony in the Book of Mormon and the restoration. He constantly says that it is the most logical option, that there needed to be a restoration, priesthood, authority to baptize, etc. So yeah will this class even cover the fact the whole priesthood thing didn't even come into play when the church says it did? That David Whitmer said he never heard about the three apostles appearing to JS and Cowdery? 

He has told me that he is going to dig into all this stuff that has led to me choosing to leave the church but he's just so busy with running a business and doing school part time, so I'm kind of hoping that this class will give him more doubts.

1lqw3a3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1lqw3a3/review_let_down_by_lunar_life_apothecary/,Review: Let Down by Lunar Life Apothecary,"Normally I strategically plan out my sample purchases by reading reviews reviews, reviewing my budget, carefully selecting my samples based on notes, recommendations, etc, but I’m gonna be honest with you on this one: I was having a bad day and I just bought on impulse because there was a sale. It was only after I made a purchase did I really dig into the IMAM reviews hoping to find some justification for my impulse spending. Instead, I found mixed sentiments and also[ some worrying claims that this house allegedly resells pre-blended perfume oils](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/12bbv3z/lunar_life_apothecary_perfume_review/), or something along those lines. Ah well, it could still be good, right? 

Let’s get to the smells:

**Croissant au Chocolat**: The reducer cap was annoying me on this one so I removed it, forgot about it, and then when I went to do a proper wear test a few weeks later I spilled nearly the entire oil sample all over myself. It starts out as a dry, artificial chocolate with not too much else, and my brain is also getting a phantom whiff of Kix cereal, which I’ve smelled before in a Little Book Eater chocolate pastry scent. It wasn’t a promising beginning, and it moved from there into a plasticky dry down. I’m not getting pastry, but my husband did walk into the room and say “it smells like you just baked chocolate chip cookies!” so I guess one of us is a fan. Also, my office did smell delicious the next day, so that should count for something. It seems to be better from a distance than up close, but I maintain that there are better chocolate pastry scents out there!  *Top: Sweet Milk Chocolate and Sea Salt, Middle: Flaky Golden Pastry and Sweet Cream, Bottom: Vanilla and Cacao Beans.* 4/10

**Evening Moon Rose Milk (Freebie):** This smells almost exactly like a pink plastic doll my dad bought me in a hotel gift shop in NYC when I was 8. A light, milky, nostalgic, rosy, artificial sweetness that reminds me of the soft pink plastic doll head. Despite my description, I want to stress that it doesn’t smell like plastic, but it smells more like some kind of rose-scented baby lotion and hotel gift shop perfume. It’s…fine? *Top: Rose Petals & Pink Pepper, Middle: Warm Milk & Tonka Bean, Base: Sandalwood & Cream* 5/10

**Babylon Fig:** I don’t know how else to categorize this other than it’s a sweet, perfumed fig. There’s no earthiness here which I really miss. I guess the notes do specify it’s “fig nectar” so maybe I should’ve been prepared for the sweetness of it all, but it quickly becomes cloying on my skin. The first scrubber of the bunch. Again I’m getting some Little Book Eater vibes. *Top Notes: Fig Nectar, Sweet Honey, Orange Zest and Milk, Middle Notes: Pink Pepper, Jasmine, Rose and Matcha Tea, Base Notes: Manuka Honey, Cedarwood, Vanilla and Fig Wood* 2.5/10

**Gelee de Rhubarbe:** Synthetic red fruit vibes. Is it a berry? A cherry? Mais non, apparently it is rhubarb! This is missing any bitterness or tangy sharpness for me. It’s very one note and not a note I particularly like. It started off quite strong but faded quickly, so no need to scrub. *TOP: Rhubarb Pectin, Lemonrind & Tart Cherry MIDDLE: Fresh Rhubarb, Red and Black Berries & Sweet Amber BASE: Cane Sugar, French Perfume & Vanilla Musk* 3/10

**Breakfast in the Buff:** I have no idea why, but when wet this smells like the India House lunch buffet to me: spiced and almost savory. It dries down sweeter and dustier with a softer spice note that comes to the top as cardamom. A little bit vanilla, a little bit milky, but despite my best sniffing efforts I couldn’t really get a handle on any hazelnut, sandalwood, coffee, pastries, etc. The notes promised a lot here and what it ended up being was an extremely light, vaguely sweet cardamom scent that disappeared in \~45 minutes. *Top Notes: Cardamom and Freshly Baked Pastries, Middle Notes: Fresh naked skin, Hazelnut Creme and Maple Syrup, Base Notes: Vanilla, Musk, Sandalwood and Freshly Roasted Coffee* 6/10

**Cafe Lanilla:** Okay y’all this smells like feet Like straight up sour feet in the bottle. I have never smelled anything like this? In my astonishment I drag my poor husband over and say “quick! Smell this! Does it smell like feet?” and he only admitted to smelling chocolate and coffee, so maybe I’m tripping. After a good long rest and a tentative skin trial, I hoping that the sour feet were a figment of my imagination, but no: under a slightly artificial vanilla and a powdery chocolate lurked that sour note. I’ve never had the “milky scent smells like cheese” problem before, but maybe that’s what is happening here? The sour foot note definitely receded from when I first received the sample, but it never went away.  ***Notes:*** *Top – Steamed milky way & toasted sugar stars, Mid – Moonbeam Vanilla Bean, Darkside of the Moonbeam Cinnamon & Cosmic Coffee, Base – Moon Milk Custard, celestial frankincense, Galactic Musk & Dark Chocolate Moon Milk* 2/10

**Boardwalk Kisses:** So I know where they’re going with this and I get a tiny bit of the buttered popcorn in the beginning, but mostly this is very very sweet one-note candied kettle corn burned butterscotch nonsense for me when I wanted something salty and interesting. It projects like crazy and is definitely the strongest out of the batch, but we’ll never know about the longevity because I had to scrub that jawn before it gave me a headache. This fragrance exists somewhere in Yankee candle format and I’m not a fan. ***Notes:***  *Sea Spray & Driftwood Middle Notes: Buttered Popcorn, Kettle Corn and Candied Pralines Base Notes: Blonde Woods, White Musk and Tonka Bean* 2.5/10

**Black Hole Honeymilk**: This goes on strong and sweet in an almost mentholated way. It reminds me a bit of a honey-flavored cough drop? I’m not getting any of the milk or smoke notes at all, it’s just a zingy honey note. It does last 5+ hours after a generous application, which is the best longevity of the bunch. I bought a 15ml of this on impulse because it was on mega-clearance, but probably wouldn’t buy again. Might destash this one if I ever get my destash list up and running. ***Notes***: *milk, honey, vanilla, smoke, amber* 6/10

At the end of the day I’m a little let down by this house; many of the notes were not hitting, and those that did were a bit artificial. Some of these had crazy projection, but almost no longevity which was confusing. Back Hole Honeymilk and Breakfast in the Buff were my picks from the bunch but still not something I would reach for. I don’t think I’ll be back to this house for any additional sampling, but knowledge is power! ",3,1751565051.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,0.8,False

Nobody wants to be glued to their screen all day, and Verti Futuro understands that. The platform offers **customizable alerts** that notify you via SMS, email, or app push notifications about important price movements or news.

You can tailor these alerts to your trading preferences, ensuring you only get relevant notifications. It’s a smart way to stay informed without getting overwhelmed.

### Multiple Asset Trading

One of Verti Futuro’s strong suits is letting you trade across different asset classes: stocks, forex, and cryptocurrencies. This diversity means you can build a balanced portfolio within one platform instead of juggling multiple accounts.

For traders looking to experiment with different markets or hedge their bets, this multi-asset support is a big plus.

## Is Verti Futuro a Scam?

I get it—there’s always skepticism when a new trading platform pops up. From my experience and research, Verti Futuro comes across as **legitimate** and trustworthy. It uses industry-standard security measures like SSL encryption and two-factor authentication to protect your account.

While no platform can guarantee profits (that’s just how markets work), Verti Futuro doesn’t show any red flags typical of scams. Plus, their customer support is responsive and transparent, which adds to their credibility.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Verti Futuro?

To start trading on Verti Futuro, the minimum deposit is **$250**. This amount aligns with many other platforms targeting serious traders while still being accessible enough for beginners willing to invest.

### Verti Futuro Customer Support

Customer service can make or break your experience with any platform. Verti Futuro offers **24/7 support** through live chat, phone, and email. From my testing, their reps were helpful and quick to respond to questions.

1lqw1f3,https://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1lqw1f3/best_zwift_workouts_for_703_training/,Best Zwift workouts for 70.3 training?,"Hi All,

I am signed up for Indian Wells in December and am trying to find the best ways to train for the bike. I have a pretty busy work schedule, so during the week I am limited to just using Zwift. On weekends I usually get my long ride in and am currently adding 5 miles each week (I did 25 last weekend). 

I am curious what workouts you all recommend on Zwift. I know you are supposed to do most of your training in Z2, but the only workout I can see on there that keeps me in Z2 is the coffee ride. What do you all do? I usually only have 30 - 60 mins to train, but still curious about longer workouts too. 

I am also curious the best way to get more comfortable in the Aero position (I already got a bike fit). I got a TT bike 2 months ago and have been training on it since. When I got it, I could only do a few minutes in Aero, now I'm doing like 20 mins at a time. I assume it gets easier with time? any particular stretches? Unfortunately when I am out riding, I am on a path with quite a few corners, so I never really have the opportunity to be in Aero for more than a minute.

Gonna be honest though, most of these I found thanks to a super sweet tour guide and some lovely folks I met on my tours.

1. **Parc des Buttes-Chaumont** : Way less crowded than Luxembourg or Tuileries. Hilly paths, waterfalls, and a mini temple that looks straight out of a painting. My favorite park by far.  
2. **Musée de la Vie Romantique :** Near the base of Montmartre. It’s small, free, and super charming. The little courtyard café is a great quiet coffee spot.  
3. **Rue Cremieux :** Yes, it’s Instagram-famous now, but go early in the morning and it’s peaceful. Feels like you stumbled into Notting Hill.  
4. **Canal Saint-Martin :** The guide suggested walking here instead of doing a Seine boat tour. Good call. It’s calm, local, and full of nice places to sit or grab a drink. If you’re into people-watching or sketching, this is GOLD.
5. **Marché d’Aligre :** Heard about this one during a wine tasting tour. It’s more local than Rue Cler and a lot more fun. Also, they were generous enough to let me try stuff.  
6. **Jardin Catherine-Labouré :** Quiet garden on the 7th that’s easy to miss. Open to the public, but barely anyone’s there. Great spot to read or chill.

1lqvwto,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lqvwto/uncover_if_the_krups_simply_brew_compact_coffee/,Uncover if the KRUPS Simply Brew Compact Coffee Maker lives up to reviews!,"The KRUPS 10942226550 Simply Brew Compact 5 Cup Coffee Maker caught my attention because of its promises of sleek design, simplicity, and functionality. As someone who enjoys a cozy cup of coffee in the morning but isn’t brewing gallons of it, this seemed like the perfect fit for my daily routine. After using it intensively for about three weeks, I’d say there’s quite a bit to unpack here—both good and bad.

**Modern Design and Space-Saving Aesthetics**  
One of the standout features of this coffee maker is its compact and minimalist design. I loved how it slotted perfectly into a small corner of my kitchen counter without hogging space. The stainless steel finish, combined with sleek black accents, adds a refined aesthetic that works well with just about any décor. It’s not an eyesore, which is refreshing since some small coffee makers can look like mini toasters from the '80s. However, the compact design does mean you’re brewing no more than five cups, which is something to bear in mind if you’ve got multiple coffee drinkers at home.

**Effortless Brewing with Just the Right Features**  
As someone who wakes up barely functional, simplicity in a coffee maker is non-negotiable. This machine features a single on/off button, which I found to be a blessing on groggy mornings. Measuring out the perfect coffee-to-water ratio is quick, thanks to the included measuring spoon and the clear water level indicator. The reusable filter is a game changer too—not having to mess with paper filters saves time and minimizes waste, which feels eco-friendly.  

[Check KRUPS 10942226550 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07x43vxzv/)

**Pause & Brew Functionality**  
For those mornings when I’m desperate for that first sip before the pot finishes brewing, the Pause & Brew feature was a lifesaver. My impatient self appreciated being able to grab a cup without risking a spill. It’s such a clever addition for a machine that’s otherwise so simple, making it feel like a premium feature in a budget-friendly appliance.

**The Keep Warm Function: Hot Coffee Anytime**  
The Keep Warm feature was another addition I quickly grew to love. After the machine finishes brewing, it keeps the coffee warm for about 30 minutes without burning it. I recently tested this on a particularly busy morning, and my second cup was just as piping hot and flavorful as the first—no microwaving required.

**Easy Cleanup? Mostly Yes**  
I tested the cleaning process thoroughly, especially since nobody wants a rigmarole after drinking coffee. The reusable mesh filter and glass carafe are dishwasher-safe, a convenience that feels like a game-changer in my kitchen. The stainless steel is easy to wipe down, and the no-drip spout keeps spills at bay. That said, I did notice that the carafe lid sometimes retains a bit of moisture even after air drying. It’s a small gripe but worth mentioning.

**Highlights**  
- Compact size fits small spaces perfectly.  
- Reusable filter reduces paper waste.  
- Simple on/off operation makes it user-friendly.  
- Pause & Brew feature for impatient coffee drinkers like me.  
- Keep Warm function ensures coffee stays at the right temperature.  

**Bad Points**  
- Brew size of up to five cups may feel limiting for larger households.  
- The lid on the carafe can trap moisture after washing.  
- No timer or programmable features could disappoint more tech-savvy users.  

**Competing Products**  
I compared this coffee maker to a few others in the same category, such as the Black+Decker 5-Cup Coffeemaker and the Mr. Coffee Mini Brew. While these rivals also target small households, the KRUPS model stands out for its sleek stainless steel construction and cleaner brew process thanks to its reusable filter. The Black+Decker model, for instance, has a plastic-heavy design, which lacks the KRUPS’s aesthetic appeal. That said, Mr. Coffee offers programmable brewing, a feature some might find more useful than KRUPS’s simplistic on/off function.  

For me, the KRUPS coffee maker hit the sweet spot between elegance and ease of use, though it falls short in automation. However, its no-fuss cleaning process and Pause & Brew are features that competitors often miss or complicate.

**Smart Spending**  
Choosing this coffee maker felt like a smart investment. It balances simplicity with useful features like the reusable filter, Pause & Brew, and Keep Warm. While it lacks the bells and whistles of higher-end drip machines, it does the basics extraordinarily well, especially at its mid-range price. For individuals or couples who want a reliable machine for daily coffee without breaking the bank, this is a solid pick.

Chapter 1  
  
My husband Sebastian Hartwell spent 80 million at auction for the 18-year-old ""lucky charm’s"" V-card blessed by a feng shui master. That same night, he brought her straight home while his buddies cheered him on.  
  
""Jules, the corporate merger needs her good fortune. Be good, okay?""  
  
""Relax, I'm not into her. It's purely business—you know, for the good luck.""  
  
I didn't cry or throw a fit. I just obediently got out of bed and gave up the master bedroom.  
  
The entitled boys burst into laughter:  
  
""Ha! What did I tell you? Mrs. Hartwell moves out even when she's half asleep!""  
  
""That's our Mrs. Hartwell for you—such restraint. No wonder she's held onto the wife position so long.""  
  
Sebastian wrapped his arm around his little plaything's waist, that self-satisfied smirk playing on his lips as he shot me a look dripping with condescension.  
  
""I'll take you to that pink diamond auction tomorrow. Isn't that what you've been after?""  
  
What he never knew was that I'd stopped wanting anything a long time ago.  
  
Including him.  
  
As I walked away, the mocking continued behind me:  
  
""Now that's what I call a good wife!""  
  
""Sebastian, you lucky bastard!""  
  
My legs felt weightless, but every step sliced like a blade.  
  
I'd been through this humiliation so many times I was practically numb to it.  
  
For two years, Sebastian's parade of women had come and gone—Instagram models, actresses, whoever caught his eye.  
  
But he'd never brought any of them home before.  
  
Until Valeria Crane—tonight's ""lucky charm.""  
  
One by one, the rich boys who came to watch the drama finally drifted off. Sebastian was finally ready to cash in on what he paid for.  
  
Through the barely closed bedroom door, her breathy moans pricked like needles against my skin.: ""Sebastian, slow down... that ugly doll is staring at us. Can we just throw it out?""  
  
I meant to turn away, but my body froze on the spot.  
  
That doll was the first gift Sebastian ever bought me.  
  
Back when he was starting his company and we were broke as hell, he stood at this little street vendor forever, refusing to leave until he could buy me something to cheer me up.  
  
From our tiny rental to this mansion, that doll had always been right there on my pillow...  
  
""Whatever.""  
  
His voice, rough and impatient, and thick with barely restrained desire, snapped me back to reality.  
  
I rushed to the guest room and locked the door, finally letting myself breathe.  
  
This mansion was supposed to be our newlywed home, built with top-notch soundproofing. But I thought I could still hear the bed creaking upstairs.  
  
Like some kind of masochist, I shoved my sleeping pills in a drawer and stared at the ceiling all night.  
  
By nine AM, I was fully made up and seated at the breakfast table.  
  
There she was—yesterday's sweet sex plaything now shuffling around in my silk pajamas and slippers, lounging like a spoiled house cat  
  
The hickeys on her neck were impossible to miss.  
  
""Morning, Mrs. Hartwell."" She casually grabbed one of our matching coffee mugs, her voice all scratchy and fake-innocent: ""Sorry I slept in... Sebastian was pretty rude last night. I could barely handle it...""  
  
I just nodded and headed upstairs for my pills.  
  
Without those pills, I'd completely lose it.  
  
When I came back down, Mason and his crew were back, filling the dining room with cigarette smoke and obnoxious laughter:  
  
""Damn, Valeria, you look completely worn out!""  
  
""Sebastian told us Jules here is like a dead fish in bed—nothing like you, you fuck like a dream!""  
  
""Honestly, wives should just keep the house clean and stay the hell out of what their man’s doing in bed.""  
  
Sebastian came downstairs adjusting his tie.  
  
He walked right past me without stopping. ""Why are you just standing there?""  
  
Before I could answer, Valeria was already at his side, fixing his collar.  
  
...  
  
I closed my eyes and pretended I didn't see any of it, then quietly sat down.  
  
Still riding the high from last night's decadent party, the guys started going on about the auction.  
  
""Sebastian, you really showed up last night. When you lit up that no-limit bid, the whole room went wild!""  
  
""The best part was when you were already getting up to leave, then suddenly sat back down and raised your paddle—""  
  
""Right! Right when Miss Crane turned around!"" Mason nudged Sebastian's shoulder with a knowing look. ""What exactly did you see that got you so hooked?""  
  
Sebastian swirled his wine glass without responding.  
  
Mason slapped his thigh. ""It had to be when Miss Crane turned—God, that slit in her dress nearly gave us a heart attack.""  
  
""Shut up."" Sebastian suddenly kicked Mason's chair over. ""All of you get the hell out.""  
  
The dining room went dead silent.  
  
Sebastian stood up and headed toward his study without looking back, but stopped at the doorway: ""You don't need to go to the family estate tomorrow.""  
  
I froze, taking a moment to process: ""I thought we were visiting the family graves?""  
  
""Valeria mentioned she likes steak too. Get the ingredients ready—tomorrow's a good chance for her to try your cooking.""  
  
His tone was casual, like he was talking to the help. ""Remember, medium-rare. She can't handle it too bloody.""  
  
So that’s what it was.  
  
I never imagined the cooking skills I'd burned my hands learning would end up feeding his mistress.  
  
Valeria fluttered over like a butterfly.  
  
""Juliette, Sebastian's taking me to the auction later, and I don't have anything nice to wear. Could I maybe—""  
  
She drew out her words, fingers already touching my sleeve. ""I don't want your new clothes or designer stuff. Could I just take what you're wearing?""  
  
My expression froze.  
  
I usually don’t blame the mistress for a man who can’t keep it in his pants—but walking around in my clothes after sexing with my husband? That hit like a gut punch.  
  
""Not this one.""  
  
Every stitch on this dress was hand-embroidered by my mother.  
  
I'd always treasured it, and Sebastian knew that. Once, in a passionate moment, he'd accidentally torn one of the buttons and I was heartbroken. He spent all night finding a tailor and coaxing me until I forgave him.  
  
Valeria's eyes immediately welled up as she tugged on Sebastian's sleeve: ""Sebastian, does Juliette hate me? It's just... this dress is so beautiful...""  
  
Sebastian's cold stare fixed on my face as he spoke those two words like venom: ""Give it to her.""  
  
Apparently, even after all this, I was beyond tears.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Four casual words, but my heart still felt like it was pierced by an ice pick.  
  
""What if I don't—""  
  
""If you don't agree,"" he cut me off with a cold laugh, ""then forget about today's auction!""  
  
My nails dug deep into my palms.  
  
I'd been preparing for this auction for a month.  
  
To buy back the jade jewelry set that had been Mom’s favorite while she was alive.  
  
I'd run all over town verifying the pieces' provenance, pulling strings to reserve a seat, even begging Sebastian to clear his schedule for me.  
  
Without the right financial backing, I couldn't get into the auction house.  
  
Sebastian was my only way in.  
  
To avoid giving him another way to control me, I lied and said I wanted that one-of-a-kind pink diamond.  
  
Compared to the pink diamond, Mom's jade set wouldn't seem like much to Sebastian—  
  
""Juliette,"" Sebastian suddenly grabbed my chin, forcing me to look up at him. ""What game are you playing now?""  
  
Valeria pretended to intervene: ""Sebastian, it's really okay. I can just throw on any old dress.""  
  
Sebastian ignored her, his eyes locked on my face: ""You think I don't know what you're thinking?""  
  
He let out a mocking laugh. ""It's about that jade set, isn't it?""  
  
My blood froze in an instant.  
  
He knew everything.  
  
He knew I'd been losing sleep over that jewelry, knew I'd been obsessively staring at that page in the auction catalog, knew... knew I'd deliberately mentioned the pink diamond to throw him off.  
  
""What a pity,"" he released me and pulled Valeria close, ""I already had that jade set pulled from the auction.""  
  
My ears started ringing.  
  
Like someone was hammering at my temples.  
  
Valeria tilted her head with fake innocence: ""Why, Sebastian?""  
  
Sebastian kissed the top of her head while staring straight at me: ""Because..."" he drew out the words slowly, ""some people don't deserve it.""  
  
Those words sliced through the rot I’d tried to ignore, carving through what was left of a heart long gone to ruin.  
  
The day Mom died.  
  
I cried until I passed out in that hospital hallway, and Sebastian held me tight, promising: ""Jules, I swear I'll protect everything your mom left behind!""  
  
And he had kept his word.  
  
Just not the way I'd hoped.  
  
""Juliette,"" he commanded coldly, ""I'm telling you one more time—take off that dress and give it to Valeria!""  
  
Valeria's fingers moved to my buttons: ""Let me help you!""  
  
\*Rip—\*  
  
The collar tore violently.  
  
Golden threads snapped, embroidered buttons scattered across the floor, rolling to Sebastian's feet.  
  
He glanced down but just nudged them aside with his shoe.  
  
His indulgence made the smugness in Valeria’s eyes nearly spill over.  
  
Her red lips curved up as she covered them with fake innocence, ""Oops, sorry about that\~""  
  
But her hands didn't let up, yanking hard as more fabric tore.  
  
Within seconds I was down to just my underwear.  
  
All those nights Mom had stayed up embroidering blessings into that dress—now it was just a cruel joke.  
  
The living room door burst open as Mason and the guys strutted in: ""Sebastian, we should head out to—""  
  
They stopped dead.  
  
I stood there without moving, didn't even try to cover myself.  
  
I was too numb to feel shame anymore.  
  
""Fuck..."" Mason's Adam's apple bobbed.  
  
Sebastian's face darkened instantly. He ripped off his suit jacket and threw it over my shoulders, then grabbed the glass ashtray from the coffee table and hurled it at the door: ""Get the hell out!""  
  
Glass exploded at Mason's feet, sending them all scrambling backwards.  
  
""Mrs.Wilson,"" his voice carried rare irritation, ""take her upstairs to get dressed.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
The auction house lights made my eyes ache.  
  
Sebastian brought me as his wife to this public event, but seated Valeria with him in the VIP section.  
  
""Next up is lot number 3,"" the auctioneer tapped his gavel. ""5.21-carat Burmese pink diamond, starting bid twenty million.""  
  
The bidding started climbing fast.  
  
When the price hit forty-eight million, Sebastian suddenly shoved the bidding paddle into my hands: ""Your turn.""  
  
Every eye in the room turned to me.  
  
The socialites started whispering:  
  
""Mrs. Hartwell's finally making her move?""  
  
""Sebastian spent eighty million on that lucky charm's virginity yesterday—guess he's buying diamonds to smooth things over with the wife.""  
  
""I heard she even gave up the master bedroom...""  
  
I called out numbly: ""Fifty million!""  
  
Sebastian was smiling, but it didn't reach his eyes.  
  
After the hammer fell, he glanced at me from across the room and suddenly said something to his assistant.  
  
Ten minutes later, the auctioneer announced: ""Next we have a last-minute addition—a jade jewelry set, starting bid...""  
  
I looked up sharply and met Sebastian's meaningful gaze.  
  
He waved his bidding paddle and placed it in Valeria's hands.  
  
So this was his real plan.  
  
Make me use up his credit limit on the pink diamond, then force me to watch my mother's final keepsake fall into another woman's hands.  
  
The panic attack hit without warning—uncontrollable nausea surged up and I bolted for the restroom.  
  
My hands shook so badly I couldn't open the pill bottle. Pills scattered across the floor.  
  
The spasms in my body kept getting worse.  
  
""What are you hiding in here for?""  
  
Valeria leaned against the doorframe.  
  
The jade necklace around her throat made my heart ache.  
  
That was my mother's wedding jewelry she'd worn for twenty years. The pendant had ""Peace"" engraved on the back in her handwriting.  
  
""Sebastian said green looks good on me, so he bought it for me."" She twirled the necklace around her finger.  
  
I gripped the sink and moved closer, clearly seeing the scar on her collarbone.  
  
In a flash, I suddenly remembered.  
  
A dark warehouse. A kidnapper's cigarette burning into a girl's collarbone.  
  
Sebastian screaming into the phone: ""Let her go first—I'll transfer the money right now...""  
  
While I was tied up on the other side, forgotten in the hands of monsters.  
  
""It's you..."" The pills dissolved into bitter liquid in my throat. ""The girl who was kidnapped with me two years ago...""  
  
""Finally figured it out?""  
  
She suddenly leaned closer. ""Sebastian didn't tell you, did he? The kidnappers only wanted sixteen million total!""  
  
Her red lips curved up. ""It's just that he could only scrape together eight million cash in one day, so you had to wait a little longer!""  
  
""But after that experience, he's not stingy anymore. He can drop eighty million on my virginity and fifty million on this jewelry set for me...""  
  
I bit down hard on my lip.  
  
One day...  
  
But I'd waited there for him for three whole days!  
  
Before I completely broke down, I lunged for her necklace, but she dodged back nimbly.  
  
The jade pendant cracked against the marble counter with a sharp \*crack\*.  
  
Blood filled my throat.  
  
""Oh no!"" Valeria suddenly grabbed my wrist. ""Why are you coughing up blood?""  
  
I shoved her away and rushed into a stall, spitting up blood-streaked bile.  
  
I heard her making a phone call outside: ""Sebastian, your wife's fine! What? A surprise for me? Yes! I'll be right there!""  
  
I crouched on the floor, feeling like I was back in that abandoned warehouse.  
  
When the kidnappers made Sebastian choose, his cold voice came clearly through the phone: ""Release the innocent one first. Jules will understand.""  
  
I understood.  
  
I understood right up until the moment someone else broke down the door with eight million in cash to save me.  
  
...  
  
The air conditioning vent above made me feel cold to the bone.  
  
After a long while, I returned to the auction hall and heard the auctioneer announce: ""Next we have a special segment—a surprise from Mr. Hartwell for Miss Crane!""  
  
The big screen lit up.  
  
There was the pink diamond I'd just bid on.  
  
Sebastian pulled Valeria onto the stage and personally slipped it onto her finger.  
  
The crowd burst into applause.  
  
The socialites' mocking voices drifted over:  
  
""I thought that was for his wife. Guess the mistress really does outrank the wife...""  
  
""I thought Mrs. Hartwell had everything under control? How did both jewelry sets end up with the gold-digger?""  
  
""Obviously! She's the chosen 'lucky charm'—marry her and Hartwell Group's stock price will probably double.""  
  
Sebastian suddenly called out from the stage: ""Jules, come up for photos.""  
  
I didn't move.  
  
""Juliette!"" Sebastian's voice hardened. ""Stop being childish.""  
  
The whole room went quiet, waiting for Mrs. Hartwell to perform gracious acceptance.  
  
But they didn't know I had nothing left to lose.  
  
So why keep pretending?  
  
My heels clicked against the red carpet like I was walking over shattered promises.  
  
I slowly made my way toward the stage.  
  
Whispers followed me:  
  
""See? The wife still has to play nice.""  
  
""Damn, she can put up with this? If my husband pulled this crap, I'd tear that bitch apart!""  
  
""That's why you're not Mrs. Hartwell...""  
  
Sebastian deliberately pulled me close by the waist.  
  
He leaned down to my ear, his voice cruel and satisfied: ""Does it hurt?""  
  
""This is what you get for running off with another man and aborting my child.""  
  
My whole body went rigid. So he'd never forgotten about the baby we lost...  
  
Cold and numb, I heard my own voice ring out clear and decisive: ""Everyone.""  
  
""I'd like to take this opportunity to announce something—""  
  
As Sebastian instinctively tightened his grip, I said word by word: ""I want a divorce.""

(I'm only interested in other fems!)

I'm someone who keeps to myself a lot I enjoy quiet mornings in nature as well as exciting nights out in the city. My main interests are video games and music, but I wouldn't consider myself a ""gamer girl"". I also have tons of other interests from fitness to playing guitar. I'm really interested in learning new things or having new experiences, I wanna meet someone who will introduce me to things I've never experienced like, take me clubbing! I wanna dance! I'm also really about self improvement so I feel I'm always working on some goal.  
My humor is mostly a mix of situational and dark humor. People have told me in the past that I have a very comforting presence.

I'm really only interested in someone local to California specifically SoCal near LA. I have no interest in anything long distance.

coffee dates, brunch, beach days, gardens, late night taco runs let’s actually *do* things!

My ideal type would be someone who talks a lot, has a very engaging and energetic personality, someone who holds eye contact and knows how to talk to me. Someone who would consider themselves extroverted. Someone who's ok with me being needy and also needing space. My favorite thing to do with my partner is to have conversations its how I build bonds so I'm looking for someone who's also into that. I'm also interested in possibly starting a family and want someone who also shares that desire. I also want someone who's genuinely kind and nice. Gentleness and kindness is the key to unlocking my heart..

I'm 5'7, light skin, average build, I would say I'm attractive, but it all depends on what you're type is. I'm monogamous and also I'm not super into LGBT culture, but its fine if you are I'm just not the type to go to pride and stuff.

On our three-year anniversary, Caden Wren sent me $1.43 cents via Venmo while transferring $143,000 to his ex-girlfriend Isolde Vance.  
  
When I refused to accept it, he actually had the nerve to call me a gold digger:  
  
""Look, I sent Isolde that money because I was worried her financial situation, not because I still have feelings for her.""  
  
""You've got my mom helping you out—what more do you want? Have you ever gone without anything since we've been together? This was meant to be your final test. Pass it, and we'd get married. God, you've really disappointed me""  
  
I dumped him right then and there. He immediately went and proposed to his ex.  
  
Five years later, we bumped into each other at one of Manhattan's most exclusive hotels. His company was about to go public, and he had Isolde on his arm—stunning in designer everything, looking absolutely perfect.  
  
There I was, covered in dirt, digging through a trash can, he frowned with complete disgust:  
  
""Wow, Elowen Hale. You wouldn't even look at $1.43 cents back then, but now you could dig through ten dumpsters and still come up empty-handed.""  
  
""Even if you've become a beggar, don't think showing up here looking pathetic is going to make me take you back. Not happening.""  
  
I completely ignored him. My son Jasper had found some special seashells at the beach earlier, but his dad had carelessly thrown them in this trash bin. My little boy was having a complete meltdown, and I needed to find those shells fast.  
  
In the hotel lobby, Caden appeared with Isolde on his arm, looking every inch the power couple.  
  
His perfectly tailored suit showed off his athletic build, and he had that confident swagger that screamed successful businessman. People in the lobby quickly recognized him and flocked over with eager smiles.  
  
""Caden! Didn't expect to see you at the Finance Summit! Taking your company public in just five years after the takeover—man, that's impressive for someone your age!""  
  
""You're here chasing that big investor too, right?""  
  
Caden gave a slight nod, and everyone got the hint. Pretty much everyone here was after the same secret heir Zion Lark.  
  
Someone turned to Isolde with a flattering smile:  
  
""This gorgeous lady must be Mrs. Wren! You two make such a perfect couple!""  
  
Isolde immediately pressed closer to Caden, flashing a radiant smile:  
  
""Oh, we're not married yet! We're totally doing it right after the IPO goes through. You guys better save the date!""  
  
Caden's expression tightened slightly before he forced an awkward smile:  
  
""Yeah, we’re both buried in work. We already know we're meant for each other—don't really need a piece of paper to prove anything.""  
  
More congratulations followed.  
  
I was honestly shocked—they still weren't married? After our breakup five years ago, he'd proposed to Isolde immediately. They were posting engagement photos all over social media within a week.  
  
He was so obsessed with her back then—you'd think he would've locked that down by now. Plus, his mother had been dying for grandchildren since day one.  
  
A hotel staff member suddenly appeared next to me, looking pissed.  
  
""Ma'am, this is a five-star resort, not some homeless shelter.""  
  
He looked me up and down with undisguised disgust.  
  
""And digging through trash cans? Absolutely not. You need to leave. Now.""  
  
I'd just gotten back from beachcombing with my son—covered in sand, salt water, hair a complete mess. I definitely didn't look like I belonged here.  
  
I quickly explained:  
  
""Look, I'm sorry, but something of mine got thrown away by mistake. I'll go back to my room as soon as I find it. I'll clean this up, I promise...""  
  
The guy cut me off impatiently:  
  
""Lady, there's no way in hell someone looking like you is staying here. Get out before I call security.""  
  
His voice carried, and people started staring.  
  
That's when Caden casually glanced back.  
  
Our eyes met, and I watched his face go through about five different emotions: ""Elowen Hale?""  
  
The staff member looked surprised: ""Mr. Wren, you know this... person?""  
  
Caden's expression quickly returned to ice-cold:  
  
""Some charity chase my mother used to sponsor. We're not close.""  
  
He looked away dismissively, exactly like when he'd coldly told me to get out during our breakup.  
  
Seeing this, the staff member actually started pushing me:  
  
""Time to go! I've dealt with people like you before. Someone throws you a bone once, and you think you can milk it forever?""  
  
I stepped aside to avoid his hands, getting annoyed:  
  
""I already told you—I'll leave as soon as I find what I'm looking for. I'll pay for any damage.""  
  
He actually laughed in my face:  
  
""Pay? With what money?"" He pointed at the trash can.  
  
""You see this? Italian designer, custom-made. Ten thousand bucks! You gonna cover that?""  
  
""Stop talking out of your ass! Everything in this place costs more than you'll make in a year!""  
  
He reached for me again.  
  
""Knock it off.""  
  
Caden, who'd been heading toward the elevator, suddenly turned back. He walked over, his face expressionless, eyes like ice.  
  
""What are you even looking for? Just tell me how much you want. I'll Venmo you right now.""  
  
""And quit this whole pathetic act to get my attention. It's embarrassing, and I'm not buying it.""  
  
Isolde immediately tightened her grip on his arm, putting on her sweetest smile:  
  
""Elowen, honey, we're getting married. I get that you're still hurt about the breakup, but this is just... sad. I hope you can maintain some dignity""  
  
I smiled back genuinely:  
  
""Congratulations, you two. Hope you'll be really happy together.""  
  
I ignored them and crouched down to continue searching for Jasper's shells.  
  
""Seriously, what's it gonna take for you to just... go away? Are you still bitter about that $143,000 I sent to Isolde?""  
  
Caden pulled out his phone impatiently, fingers flying across the screen:  
  
""Fine. Whatever. I'll send you the money right now. Take it and disappear. I never want to see you again.""  
  
""I've always been in love with Isolde. Those two years with you? That was just me running from my real feelings for her.""  
  
""This money's enough for you to get your life together. Find some guy who's actually on your level and stop obsessing over me.""  
  
Suddenly, his fingers stopped moving.  
  
""Wait, what the hell? Your account's frozen. You're a deadbeat?""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
It suddenly clicked.  
  
He was trying to transfer money to that old card from when I was on charity.  
  
After getting married, I'd been using my husband's black card exclusively. Of course that old account got frozen—totally normal, right?  
  
Apparently in his mind, I'm still the same person I was back then. Used to be a gold digger and a charity case, now I've been upgraded to deadbeat.  
  
""I don't need your money."" My voice was flat. I really couldn't be bothered to explain.  
  
His tone got colder:  
  
""You're literally digging through trash cans, but you won't accept help?""  
  
I frowned, confused:  
  
""We broke up five years ago. We're strangers now—why would I need your help?""  
  
After a pause, I added:  
  
""Seriously, don't send me money. I don't need it.""  
  
If a certain someone found out some guy was transferring money to me, he’d interrogate me relentlessly, digging for answers. And if he dug up my history with Caden, he'd be jealous for months.  
  
Caden looked stunned, then let out a mocking laugh:  
  
""Elowen, I think you're confused. I'm offering you money out of pity. Don't worry—I have zero interest in you.""  
  
He stared at my disheveled appearance for a long moment, his expression growing complicated:  
  
""You've really became a beggar. Maybe the breakup messed you up more than I thought... I guess I do bear some responsibility for that.""  
  
""You won't take the money because you want me to feel guilty forever?""  
  
Isolde immediately stepped in to comfort him:  
  
""Caden, honey, she's a med school graduate with two working hands. Finding a job to support herself shouldn't be that hard.""  
  
""She's in this mess because she's lazy and has no ambition.""  
  
""Actually, we could see it even back then. Sure, her family was poor, but she could've worked part-time to pay for school. Instead, she just took your mom's money like it was owed to her. Shows you what kind of person she is—poor and lazy...""  
  
""Isolde!"" I snapped. ""I paid back every penny of that charity money with interest. Watch your mouth.""  
  
Isolde flinched and tugged on Caden's sleeve:  
  
""Forget it, Caden. She cares too much about appearances. Your kindness will just feel like an insult to her. Let's just leave her alone.""  
  
""My business is none of your concern."" I turned back to the trash can coldly.  
  
Suddenly, I spotted a bag of colorful shells.  
  
I breathed a sigh of relief and reached for it, but Caden suddenly grabbed my wrist and yanked me up roughly.  
  
""Elowen, You wouldn't even look at $1.43 cents back then, but now you could dig through ten dumpsters and still come up empty-handed.""  
  
""Even if you've become a beggar, showing up here looking pathetic isn't going to make me take you back.""  
  
I was speechless.  
  
After all these years, he still thought I broke up with him over $1.43 cents?  
  
That year, Isolde had left for grad school abroad without a word—a brutal breakup that nearly destroyed him. His mother asked me to look after him, and out of gratitude for her support, I stayed by his side through it all.  
  
Eventually, we naturally ended up together.  
  
But as soon as Isolde came back, he started getting cold. Wouldn't answer my calls, ignored my texts.  
  
On our three-year anniversary, he sent me $1.43 cents—wasn't that basically telling me to leave?  
  
The pathetic part was, I still couldn't let go.  
  
Not until Isolde sent me that message did I finally give up. Didn't he remember?  
  
I stared at his hand gripping my wrist and said calmly:  
  
""Caden, I'm doing great now. I've never thought about coming back to you. You can relax.""  
  
I tried to pull my hand away, but he wouldn't budge.  
  
""Weren't you the one who said not to come crying back to you after we broke up? I've never forgotten that.""  
  
He narrowed his eyes at me. To completely put his mind at ease, I added:  
  
""I'm married now. My husband has a bit of a temper. If he saw us like this, it wouldn't be good for anyone.""  
  
He immediately let go, his face full of shock:  
  
""You dare get married without my permission?""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
He frowned deeply:  
  
""Where the hell is your husband? What kind of man lets his wife fall so low like this?""  
  
I didn't answer. He suddenly let out a mocking laugh:  
  
""Nice try. Almost had me fooled. What, trying to make me jealous by claiming you're married? Even if you said you had kids, I wouldn't give a damn.""  
  
He didn't need to spell it out.  
  
I knew better than anyone that Isolde was the only one in his heart.  
  
But he was the one who came to me first back then.  
  
I'd asked him over and over if he was really over Isolde, and he swore up and down that he'd forgotten all about her. Only then did I agree to be with him.  
  
Now somehow I'm the one who was supposedly scheming and clinging to him?  
  
I shrugged, not caring anymore:  
  
""Think whatever you want.""  
  
Isolde dramatically took a step back:  
  
""Caden, honey, it smells awful here. Let's go. She clearly doesn't appreciate our help anyway.""  
  
But Caden's eyes stayed locked on me, showing no intention of leaving.  
  
Isolde shot me a cold look:  
  
""Such ridiculous pride. Tell you what—we're meeting with an investor today, and we could use someone to serve coffee and water. If you're willing, I can pay you fifty grand.""  
  
""That should be enough for someone like you to live on for a whole year, right?""  
  
Caden finally responded:  
  
""Elowen, you're just too stubborn. You won't take money directly, but you should at least accept payment for work, right?""  
  
I was so angry I almost laughed.  
  
""Are you two seriously that bored? I don't have time for your little rich people charity games. Stay away from me.""  
  
I'd specifically turned down several major surgeries to squeeze out these three days for Jasper's summer vacation.  
  
And they wanted me to serve coffee? Absolutely ridiculous.  
  
My repeated refusals made Caden's face darken, and even the usually composed Isolde couldn't help rolling her eyes.  
  
The crowd around us started murmuring:  
  
""Caden, this woman's broke and stubborn as hell. You really want her serving that VIP guest?""  
  
""I'd just drop it. If she pisses off the wrong person, we'll all be screwed.""  
  
The staff member panicked and quickly called security:  
  
""Get her out of here! The investor pitch is about to start, and that guest in the penthouse suite could come down any minute.""  
  
He glared at me through gritted teeth:  
  
""Ma'am, today's guests are all Manhattan's elite! Especially that young heir from the Lark family in Boston—he even brought his wife and kid. This is the biggest event our hotel has ever hosted!""  
  
""Usually, I might look the other way when you dig through trash, maybe even give you some cardboard to sell. But not today! You causing a scene will ruin the hotel's reputation with the elite from both cities!""  
  
""That's not something a lowly staff member like me can handle... Please, I'm begging you, just leave.""  
  
The security guards immediately moved forward to physically drag me away.  
  
I struggled free: ""I can walk myself out!""  
  
Seeing that I was finally leaving, everyone in the lobby let out a collective sigh of relief.  
  
""Wait!""  
  
Caden suddenly shouted.  
  
His eyes were fixed on the shells in my hand, his fists clenched so tight at his sides that his knuckles had turned white.  
  
""Elowen,"" his voice was hoarse, ""why don't you get it... I don't need these shells anymore.""

1lqvsl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1lqvsl1/dca_weekly_coffee_and_meal_into_btc/,DCA weekly coffee and meal into BTC,"If you DCA the money you save from having a coffee at home and not going out once a week, into a savings account or BTC, how much will you save every year and over 5 years?

total annual savings from:

Making coffee at home instead of Starbucks (1 cup/day)

Skipping 1 restaurant meal per week (with 1 alcoholic drink)

Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) that into a savings account

 Coffee Savings (Daily) 

Savings per cup: ~$3.50

Days per year: 365

Total/year: $3.50 × 365 = $1,277.50

 Restaurant Savings (Weekly)

Savings per meal out: ~$28 (average of $20–$37)

Weeks/year: 52

Total/year: $28 × 52 = $1,456

 Total Annual Savings (Coffee + Eating In) $1,277.50 + $1,456 = $2,733.50

If You DCA into a Savings Account

Let’s assume a high-yield savings account with ~4.0% APY, compounded monthly.

If you deposit weekly (about $52.57/week), by year-end you’ll have: 

Around $2,800–$2,850, depending on exact compounding timing.

putting those lifestyle savings to work in Bitcoin instead of just parking it in cash could be a game-changer over time.

Yearly Savings from Coffee + Skipping 1 Meal Out/Week $2,733.50/year, or about $52.57/week. Let’s use historical BTC average returns for reference:

Last 5 years (2019-2024) approximately 80%

Last 10 years (2014-2024) approximately 50-60%. To be conservative, let’s model two cases:

Scenario A: 50% Annual Return (Long-Term Avg) Using $52.57/week DCA over 1 year into BTC:

Investing $2,733.50 After 1 Year @ 50% Growth:
~$2,733.50 × 1.50 = $4,100

Scenario B: 80% Annual Return (Recent Bull Market Trend) After 1 Year @ 80% Growth: ~$2,733.50 × 1.80 = $4,920

5-Year Projection (If You Do This Every Year) Assuming $2,733.50 invested per year, reinvested + annual BTC returns:

Estimate value in 5 years:

Savings account at 4% is approximately $15,000

BTC at 50%-60% return is approximately $25,000-$35,000

BTC Bull case at 80% return would be approximately $60,000 

This is a hypothetical scenario and returns are always impacted by market and macroeconomic conditions. We all try to make money to have a comfortable life by having disposable money to do the things we love to do. Cutting enjoyable fun things from life for future returns is not realistic for most of us. Please don’t take this as a serious investing strategy.",0,1751564359.0,Bitcoin,1,0.33,False

I met my significant other in Miami and she got pregnant recently. I haven’t lived with her before so I did not see any of her current mental health issues. She’s currently going through psychosis episodes and is not willing to accept that she needs to get help or any sort of medication. She keeps saying that someone is coming to kill her. So looking back at last year she had mentioned that she was kidnapped to Mexico and had an abortion there. I was able to confirm this by finding fbi reports and directly talking with the case agents. I assume at the moment the psychosis issues she’s having are related to this. To make things even insane she calls the person who’s currently in prison for kidnapping her, brother. 
She also had trouble recently with the manager at the building where we live now. She had told him that this is her father’s building and she belongs here. All this to say I’m having a hard time finding a therapist who’s willing to work with me in this case. I need someone to hear her out not at a therapy session maybe at our condo building or a coffee shop so I can get her to come and have a conversation but she can get agitated if the therapist try to go fast. Since she believes in her fantasy very strongly. We live in South Florida. Pretty much every therapist I’ve encountered tells me she needs to acknowledge and call her self for help but she will not do that! So I’m at a lost here trying to find someone to diagnose her and recommend next steps. Can I please get you alls input 🙏",1,1751564289.0,Psychosis,0,1.0,False

1lqvpzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Striking_Phrase_7256/comments/1lqvpzg/the_knock_that_knew_my_name/,The Knock That Knew My Name,"It was a Wednesday night in late June, and I was alone in my house in a quiet suburb outside Raleigh, North Carolina. I’m 31, a freelance writer, and I’d been grinding on a deadline all day, so I was looking forward to unwinding. The forecast had mentioned a storm, but I didn’t think much of it—just another rainy night. I live in a small, one-story house, the kind with creaky floors and a big front porch that catches every gust of wind. By 7 PM, the sky was dark, and the rain was coming down hard, drumming on the roof like a heartbeat. I was in my living room, sipping coffee, scrolling through Twitter on my laptop, the TV muttering in the background.

Around 9 PM, the storm kicked into high gear. Thunder rattled the windows, and the power flickered, making my heart jump a little. I’m not usually spooked by storms, but something about this one felt heavy, oppressive. I got up to check the locks—habit from living alone—when I heard it: a knock. Three slow, deliberate raps on the front door. My stomach twisted. Who’d be out in this weather? I stood frozen in the hallway, waiting. Maybe it was a neighbor needing help. The knock came again, louder. “Ellie?” a man’s voice called, low and rough, barely audible over the rain. My blood ran cold. That’s my name. How did they know my name?

I didn’t answer. My mind was racing. Was this a friend pulling a prank? I don’t have many visitors, and no one I know would show up unannounced in a storm. I crept to the peephole, my socks silent on the hardwood. The porch light was on, but the rain was so thick I could barely make out anything—just a vague shape, maybe a person, standing under the awning. Lightning flashed, and for a second, I saw him: a man, tall, in a dark jacket, his face hidden by a baseball cap. He knocked again, harder. “Ellie, I know you’re home.” My heart was pounding. Was I being paranoid? I didn’t recognize the voice.

I backed away, grabbing my phone from the couch. I thought about calling 911, but what would I say? Someone’s knocking? I texted my neighbor, Sarah, who lives across the street: “Someone’s at my door. Acting weird. You home?” No reply—she was probably asleep. The knocking stopped, and I let out a shaky breath, thinking maybe he’d left. Then my phone buzzed with a notification from my smart doorbell app, a cheap one I’d installed last year. Motion detected. I opened the feed, my hands trembling. The camera showed the porch, empty now, but there was something new—a single muddy boot print on the welcome mat. My stomach dropped. He’d been right there.

I locked myself in my bedroom, shoving a chair under the doorknob. My house has a back door, so I checked it—locked, thank God. But as I stood there, I heard something worse than knocking: a faint scraping, like metal on wood, coming from the back door. My skin crawled. Was he trying to break in? I grabbed a baseball bat from my closet, my mind screaming. Why was this happening? Had I been watched? I crouched by the bed, listening. The scraping stopped, replaced by a low whistle—short, sharp, like someone signaling. I froze. Was there more than one person out there?

My phone buzzed again. Another doorbell alert. I opened the app, dreading what I’d see. The feed showed the porch again, still empty, but now there was a piece of paper tucked under the mat, flapping in the wind. My heart sank. Had he left something? I didn’t dare go out to check. Then a text came through from an unknown number: “Check the paper, Ellie.” I nearly dropped my phone. How did they have my number? My name? I didn’t reply, didn’t move. Another text: “I just want to talk.” I turned off my phone, terrified the screen’s light would give away my position. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely grip the bat.

The storm raged on, thunder masking any sounds from outside. I stayed in my bedroom, bat in hand, jumping at every creak of the house. Around midnight, the rain eased up, and I hadn’t heard anything for a while. I worked up the courage to check the doorbell feed again. The paper was still there, now soaked through. I zoomed in, and my blood ran cold. It wasn’t just paper—it was a photo, blurry but unmistakable. It was me, taken from across the street, walking into my house earlier that week. My knees buckled. Was this guy stalking me? For how long?

I called 911, whispering so my voice wouldn’t carry. The dispatcher said they’d send a patrol car, but the storm was causing delays. I stayed put, listening for any sign of him. At one point, I thought I heard footsteps on the porch, slow and deliberate, but the doorbell didn’t trigger again. By 2 AM, the police arrived. They found the photo, now a soggy mess, and confirmed it was me, but the image was too damaged to make out details. They searched the area—no sign of anyone. The boot print was gone, washed away by the rain. The texts weren’t in my phone anymore, like they’d vanished. The officers said it could’ve been a prank, but their faces looked uneasy.

I posted about it on Reddit the next day, hoping for answers. Some users said my neighborhood has had issues with prowlers targeting houses during storms, using the noise to cover their movements. One commenter mentioned a guy who’d been caught watching homes in the area, leaving photos to scare people. He was never charged—not enough evidence. I installed a better security system and started staying with Sarah on stormy nights. I still don’t know who he was or how he knew my name. Every time it rains, I check the doorbell feed, half-expecting to see that boot printagain.

To give some context, for about half a year now my dad has been waking up anytime from 12am through to 5am and making breakfast in our kitchen downstairs without any regard to how much noise he’s making. He makes no effort to be quiet while the does this, using the coffee maker and stove appliances loudly, dropping items into the sink, laughing at things he watches on his computer etc.

My bedroom also just so happens to be right on top of the kitchen which means I hear EVERYTHING that goes on down there. I find it extremely hard to fall asleep regardless of he’s antics and usually find myself awake trying to fall asleep for hours most nights. Usually when I get to the point of being sleepy enough to fall sleep he decides to start doing his thing which is where my problem lies. 

I have tried on many occasions to ask him to stop or do it later, or tried to compromise/reason with him. Every time I do this he immediately gets angry at me telling me to shut the fuck up, calling me rude names screaming at me, labelling me a prick or a “Fucking moron” and in almost all cases threatens to kick me out of the house. He has also threatened to hurt me because of my asking him to stop. 

The most recent incident being an hour ago where he again threatened to hurt me as he stopped making his food and started to climb the staircase to get up to me. My mum had intervened stopping him and calming him down as she told me to go back to bed in my room where I am now writing this. 

I’m unsure of what I should do to stop this whole thing from happening, I can’t talk to my dad directly about is as he has some bad anger issues and always finds a way to label me as the bad guy, or he’ll ignore me entirely. My mum doesn’t like confrontation and doesn’t do anything to help. Reddit if anyone has any advice, tips etc I’d greatly appreciate them.",0,1751564057.0,Advice,6,0.5,False

Everett Vaughn chased me for three years—everyone said he was madly in love with me.  
  
Just recently, I finally said yes to his proposal.  
  
But the night before our wedding, I overheard something I was never supposed to hear.  
  
""Sloane Mercer? She's as dull as drywall. If it weren't for the mission, I wouldn't even look at her.""  
  
""Once I secure the wedding, the second it's done, I'm dumping her ass.""  
  
I pretended I didn't hear a thing.  
  
I played along—right up until the wedding.  
  
Then I walked away without looking back.  
  
Later, my friend told me that cold, composed Professor Vaughn lost it for the first time—right there in front of a whole room full of stunned guests.  
  
\---  
  
Everett always wore that calm, untouchable mask in public.  
  
So when I saw him holding hands with another woman, smiling like a goddamn fairytale, I froze.  
  
The wedding was just days away.  
  
I'd just stepped out of the bridal boutique, still half-floating from trying on my gown.  
  
Then I got in my car—and saw him.  
  
My fiancé. Everett Vaughn.  
  
The same Everett who'd told me he was too busy with work to meet today.  
  
Now he was standing on a crowded downtown sidewalk…  
  
Making out with some girl like the world didn't even exist.  
  
It was like someone dumped a bucket of ice water over me.  
  
Two hours ago, he held me and said I was the only woman he'd ever love.  
  
Now he was kissing someone else like I never even existed.  
  
I couldn't believe my eyes.  
  
I don't know how long I sat there, staring like a ghost.  
  
Eventually, my hand moved on its own—I called him.  
  
A few feet away, Everett flinched at the ringtone.  
  
His smile vanished, jaw tightening just a bit.  
  
Still, he answered.  
  
""Hey, babe,"" he said, voice soft as ever.  
  
""Miss me already?""  
  
It was the same charming voice I'd fallen for.  
  
My heart twisted so hard I thought it might split open. My mind was blank.  
  
""Everett… what are you doing right now?""  
  
He chuckled, low and warm. Like everything was fine.  
  
""Just wrapped up a lecture, sweetheart.""  
  
""Was about to grab that cake you love. Be home soon, okay?""  
  
He sounded so natural. Not a crack in his act.  
  
Then—he reached over and ran his fingers through the other girl's hair.  
  
So casually. So gently.  
  
I watched them, numb, tears sliding down my cheeks before I could stop them.  
  
I'd thought Everett was the answer to the broken pieces of my life.  
  
I thought he was my safe place, my ending.  
  
But this?  
  
This was never love.  
  
It was a goddamn lie.  
  
He chased me for three years.  
  
And under a rain of flowers and applause, I said yes.  
  
I thought it was forever.  
  
Turned out it was all just a setup.  
  
It took me a long time to find my voice.  
  
""Sure,"" I whispered. ""I'll be waiting.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Everett came back not long after.  
  
His expression was as soft as always—those eyes practically dripping with affection when they landed on me.  
  
He set the little cake box down on the table, then walked over and wrapped his arms around me, resting his chin gently on my shoulder like we were the only two people on Earth.  
  
""God, I missed you,"" he whispered.  
  
""I keep thinking—we're getting married in just two weeks, and I can't even handle how happy that makes me…""  
  
I just stood there, numb. Empty.  
  
I hadn't figured out how to even process the betrayal, let alone confront it.  
  
I stepped out of his embrace.  
  
""I'm tired. I think I'll lie down for a bit.""  
  
He kissed me lightly on the cheek.  
  
""Of course, baby. Go rest. I'm gonna shower real quick.""  
  
Mind spinning, I walked toward the bedroom—only to realize I'd left my phone on the coffee table.  
  
As I passed the bathroom, I heard his voice.  
  
""System, where's her affection level at?""  
  
""Congratulations, Host. Target's affection level has reached ninety-eight percent.""  
  
Everett let out a laugh—low, giddy, like he was finally winning something.  
  
""Finally! God, these last three years have been pure hell.""  
  
""Sloane Mercer is such a damn bore.""  
  
""If it wasn't for the mission, I wouldn't even look at her!""  
  
""Soon as I marry her and the mission's done, I'm dumping her ass—no hesitation.""  
  
Then that… whatever it was—the ""System""—spoke again.  
  
""Host, are you saying there's not even a sliver of genuine feeling for her?""  
  
Everett chuckled. Arrogant. Cruel.  
  
""For her? Are you kidding?""  
  
""I'd have to be out of my damn mind. She's dull as dry toast.""  
  
""Give me a girl like Noelle any day.""  
  
I stood outside the door, frozen.  
  
Four words echoed in my head.  
  
Dull as dry toast.  
  
So that's what I'd been to him all along.  
  
All those quiet doubts I'd buried for years finally clawed their way to the surface.  
  
I grew up without parents. Bounced between foster homes. Always felt like a stray.  
  
So when someone like Everett came after me, I didn't understand it.  
  
A man like him? Smart. Charming. Accomplished.  
  
Why would he ever want… me?  
  
Now I knew.  
  
It wasn't love. It was strategy.  
  
Some sick, twisted ""mission.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I grabbed my phone and headed to the bedroom.  
  
But instead of sleeping, I started torturing myself.  
  
I pulled up Everett's Twitter.  
  
He posted there all the time—every little moment we shared, every meal, every silly inside joke.  
  
I liked every single post.  
  
And I was his only follow.  
  
At least… I thought I was.  
  
There was someone else.  
  
A second account.  
  
Username: u/orangesaretheonlyfruit  
  
My gut twisted.  
  
Orange? Noelle?  
  
Before I could stop myself, I tapped on her profile.  
  
The latest tweet was from two hours ago.  
  
""You showed up the second I called. So… does that mean you kinda like me?""  
  
Attached was a photo.  
  
Two hands. Intertwined.  
  
I recognized one of them immediately.  
  
Everett's.  
  
If his feed was all about me, hers was all about him.  
  
And I couldn't look away.  
  
I scrolled and scrolled—self-destructing on purpose.  
  
Then I saw the oldest post.  
  
""Finally got a date with my dream guy. So happy.""  
  
The image?  
  
A hotel room door.  
  
The timestamp?  
  
Three years ago.  
  
Three months after Everett and I started dating.  
  
They'd been together since the beginning.  
  
My stomach turned.  
  
Nausea rolled in waves.  
  
I doubled over, shaking. Eyes burning.  
  
I remembered the early days with Everett.  
  
How insecure I was.  
  
Once, he showed up late to dinner—by five minutes.  
  
I snapped. Lashed out.  
  
He didn't argue. Didn't defend himself.  
  
He just held me.  
  
Later, I apologized.  
  
He'd smiled, brushed my hair back so gently.  
  
""Baby, you're only mad because you care. I love that about you. I'm not mad—not even a little.""  
  
He kissed me, slow and tender.  
  
""Sloane Mercer, you don't ever have to pretend around me. Be yourself—always.""  
  
I cried in his arms that night, overwhelmed by the warmth.  
  
And he just looked at me like I was his whole world.  
  
Was that all fake too?  
  
Because back then, it sure felt real.

We have a delonghi burr grinder, which isn't amazing, but is decent enough for us at this point.

We drink mainly black coffee (espresso or americano), so we don't need any bells and whistles when it comes to milk frothing, so I'm thinking a Bambino Plus isn't worth the extra money (unless I'm missing something with the other features?). We enjoy our coffee, but aren't at the point where we are wanting to get technical about it. We're in Canada, and would like to keep the price around $500 CAD or less, but also something that will last more than 2-3 years.

I've been trying to find information about the Bambino - I read reviews that there are issues with the Plus one leaking around the drip tray, but can't find if that is also a problem with the OG? We have a butcher block counter, so definitely don't want to have to worry about leaking or water collecting under the machine. I also saw with the Plus that it shuts down after 200 shots and you can't override that at all, you have to stop and do a cleaning cycle. Does that happen with the OG as well? (Sorry - it's been really hard to find a lot on the OG, as most reviews are about the Plus).

On our three-year anniversary, Caden Wren sent me $1.43 cents via Venmo while transferring $143,000 to his ex-girlfriend Isolde Vance.  
  
When I refused to accept it, he actually had the nerve to call me a gold digger:  
  
""Look, I sent Isolde that money because I was worried her financial situation, not because I still have feelings for her.""  
  
""You've got my mom helping you out—what more do you want? Have you ever gone without anything since we've been together? This was meant to be your final test. Pass it, and we'd get married. God, you've really disappointed me""  
  
I dumped him right then and there. He immediately went and proposed to his ex.  
  
Five years later, we bumped into each other at one of Manhattan's most exclusive hotels. His company was about to go public, and he had Isolde on his arm—stunning in designer everything, looking absolutely perfect.  
  
There I was, covered in dirt, digging through a trash can, he frowned with complete disgust:  
  
""Wow, Elowen Hale. You wouldn't even look at $1.43 cents back then, but now you could dig through ten dumpsters and still come up empty-handed.""  
  
""Even if you've become a beggar, don't think showing up here looking pathetic is going to make me take you back. Not happening.""  
  
I completely ignored him. My son Jasper had found some special seashells at the beach earlier, but his dad had carelessly thrown them in this trash bin. My little boy was having a complete meltdown, and I needed to find those shells fast.  
  
In the hotel lobby, Caden appeared with Isolde on his arm, looking every inch the power couple.  
  
His perfectly tailored suit showed off his athletic build, and he had that confident swagger that screamed successful businessman. People in the lobby quickly recognized him and flocked over with eager smiles.  
  
""Caden! Didn't expect to see you at the Finance Summit! Taking your company public in just five years after the takeover—man, that's impressive for someone your age!""  
  
""You're here chasing that big investor too, right?""  
  
Caden gave a slight nod, and everyone got the hint. Pretty much everyone here was after the same secret heir Zion Lark.  
  
Someone turned to Isolde with a flattering smile:  
  
""This gorgeous lady must be Mrs. Wren! You two make such a perfect couple!""  
  
Isolde immediately pressed closer to Caden, flashing a radiant smile:  
  
""Oh, we're not married yet! We're totally doing it right after the IPO goes through. You guys better save the date!""  
  
Caden's expression tightened slightly before he forced an awkward smile:  
  
""Yeah, we’re both buried in work. We already know we're meant for each other—don't really need a piece of paper to prove anything.""  
  
More congratulations followed.  
  
I was honestly shocked—they still weren't married? After our breakup five years ago, he'd proposed to Isolde immediately. They were posting engagement photos all over social media within a week.  
  
He was so obsessed with her back then—you'd think he would've locked that down by now. Plus, his mother had been dying for grandchildren since day one.  
  
A hotel staff member suddenly appeared next to me, looking pissed.  
  
""Ma'am, this is a five-star resort, not some homeless shelter.""  
  
He looked me up and down with undisguised disgust.  
  
""And digging through trash cans? Absolutely not. You need to leave. Now.""  
  
I'd just gotten back from beachcombing with my son—covered in sand, salt water, hair a complete mess. I definitely didn't look like I belonged here.  
  
I quickly explained:  
  
""Look, I'm sorry, but something of mine got thrown away by mistake. I'll go back to my room as soon as I find it. I'll clean this up, I promise...""  
  
The guy cut me off impatiently:  
  
""Lady, there's no way in hell someone looking like you is staying here. Get out before I call security.""  
  
His voice carried, and people started staring.  
  
That's when Caden casually glanced back.  
  
Our eyes met, and I watched his face go through about five different emotions: ""Elowen Hale?""  
  
The staff member looked surprised: ""Mr. Wren, you know this... person?""  
  
Caden's expression quickly returned to ice-cold:  
  
""Some charity chase my mother used to sponsor. We're not close.""  
  
He looked away dismissively, exactly like when he'd coldly told me to get out during our breakup.  
  
Seeing this, the staff member actually started pushing me:  
  
""Time to go! I've dealt with people like you before. Someone throws you a bone once, and you think you can milk it forever?""  
  
I stepped aside to avoid his hands, getting annoyed:  
  
""I already told you—I'll leave as soon as I find what I'm looking for. I'll pay for any damage.""  
  
He actually laughed in my face:  
  
""Pay? With what money?"" He pointed at the trash can.  
  
""You see this? Italian designer, custom-made. Ten thousand bucks! You gonna cover that?""  
  
""Stop talking out of your ass! Everything in this place costs more than you'll make in a year!""  
  
He reached for me again.  
  
""Knock it off.""  
  
Caden, who'd been heading toward the elevator, suddenly turned back. He walked over, his face expressionless, eyes like ice.  
  
""What are you even looking for? Just tell me how much you want. I'll Venmo you right now.""  
  
""And quit this whole pathetic act to get my attention. It's embarrassing, and I'm not buying it.""  
  
Isolde immediately tightened her grip on his arm, putting on her sweetest smile:  
  
""Elowen, honey, we're getting married. I get that you're still hurt about the breakup, but this is just... sad. I hope you can maintain some dignity""  
  
I smiled back genuinely:  
  
""Congratulations, you two. Hope you'll be really happy together.""  
  
I ignored them and crouched down to continue searching for Jasper's shells.  
  
""Seriously, what's it gonna take for you to just... go away? Are you still bitter about that $143,000 I sent to Isolde?""  
  
Caden pulled out his phone impatiently, fingers flying across the screen:  
  
""Fine. Whatever. I'll send you the money right now. Take it and disappear. I never want to see you again.""  
  
""I've always been in love with Isolde. Those two years with you? That was just me running from my real feelings for her.""  
  
""This money's enough for you to get your life together. Find some guy who's actually on your level and stop obsessing over me.""  
  
Suddenly, his fingers stopped moving.  
  
""Wait, what the hell? Your account's frozen. You're a deadbeat?""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
It suddenly clicked.  
  
He was trying to transfer money to that old card from when I was on charity.  
  
After getting married, I'd been using my husband's black card exclusively. Of course that old account got frozen—totally normal, right?  
  
Apparently in his mind, I'm still the same person I was back then. Used to be a gold digger and a charity case, now I've been upgraded to deadbeat.  
  
""I don't need your money."" My voice was flat. I really couldn't be bothered to explain.  
  
His tone got colder:  
  
""You're literally digging through trash cans, but you won't accept help?""  
  
I frowned, confused:  
  
""We broke up five years ago. We're strangers now—why would I need your help?""  
  
After a pause, I added:  
  
""Seriously, don't send me money. I don't need it.""  
  
If a certain someone found out some guy was transferring money to me, he’d interrogate me relentlessly, digging for answers. And if he dug up my history with Caden, he'd be jealous for months.  
  
Caden looked stunned, then let out a mocking laugh:  
  
""Elowen, I think you're confused. I'm offering you money out of pity. Don't worry—I have zero interest in you.""  
  
He stared at my disheveled appearance for a long moment, his expression growing complicated:  
  
""You've really became a beggar. Maybe the breakup messed you up more than I thought... I guess I do bear some responsibility for that.""  
  
""You won't take the money because you want me to feel guilty forever?""  
  
Isolde immediately stepped in to comfort him:  
  
""Caden, honey, she's a med school graduate with two working hands. Finding a job to support herself shouldn't be that hard.""  
  
""She's in this mess because she's lazy and has no ambition.""  
  
""Actually, we could see it even back then. Sure, her family was poor, but she could've worked part-time to pay for school. Instead, she just took your mom's money like it was owed to her. Shows you what kind of person she is—poor and lazy...""  
  
""Isolde!"" I snapped. ""I paid back every penny of that charity money with interest. Watch your mouth.""  
  
Isolde flinched and tugged on Caden's sleeve:  
  
""Forget it, Caden. She cares too much about appearances. Your kindness will just feel like an insult to her. Let's just leave her alone.""  
  
""My business is none of your concern."" I turned back to the trash can coldly.  
  
Suddenly, I spotted a bag of colorful shells.  
  
I breathed a sigh of relief and reached for it, but Caden suddenly grabbed my wrist and yanked me up roughly.  
  
""Elowen, You wouldn't even look at $1.43 cents back then, but now you could dig through ten dumpsters and still come up empty-handed.""  
  
""Even if you've become a beggar, showing up here looking pathetic isn't going to make me take you back.""  
  
I was speechless.  
  
After all these years, he still thought I broke up with him over $1.43 cents?  
  
That year, Isolde had left for grad school abroad without a word—a brutal breakup that nearly destroyed him. His mother asked me to look after him, and out of gratitude for her support, I stayed by his side through it all.  
  
Eventually, we naturally ended up together.  
  
But as soon as Isolde came back, he started getting cold. Wouldn't answer my calls, ignored my texts.  
  
On our three-year anniversary, he sent me $1.43 cents—wasn't that basically telling me to leave?  
  
The pathetic part was, I still couldn't let go.  
  
Not until Isolde sent me that message did I finally give up. Didn't he remember?  
  
I stared at his hand gripping my wrist and said calmly:  
  
""Caden, I'm doing great now. I've never thought about coming back to you. You can relax.""  
  
I tried to pull my hand away, but he wouldn't budge.  
  
""Weren't you the one who said not to come crying back to you after we broke up? I've never forgotten that.""  
  
He narrowed his eyes at me. To completely put his mind at ease, I added:  
  
""I'm married now. My husband has a bit of a temper. If he saw us like this, it wouldn't be good for anyone.""  
  
He immediately let go, his face full of shock:  
  
""You dare get married without my permission?""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
He frowned deeply:  
  
""Where the hell is your husband? What kind of man lets his wife fall so low like this?""  
  
I didn't answer. He suddenly let out a mocking laugh:  
  
""Nice try. Almost had me fooled. What, trying to make me jealous by claiming you're married? Even if you said you had kids, I wouldn't give a damn.""  
  
He didn't need to spell it out.  
  
I knew better than anyone that Isolde was the only one in his heart.  
  
But he was the one who came to me first back then.  
  
I'd asked him over and over if he was really over Isolde, and he swore up and down that he'd forgotten all about her. Only then did I agree to be with him.  
  
Now somehow I'm the one who was supposedly scheming and clinging to him?  
  
I shrugged, not caring anymore:  
  
""Think whatever you want.""  
  
Isolde dramatically took a step back:  
  
""Caden, honey, it smells awful here. Let's go. She clearly doesn't appreciate our help anyway.""  
  
But Caden's eyes stayed locked on me, showing no intention of leaving.  
  
Isolde shot me a cold look:  
  
""Such ridiculous pride. Tell you what—we're meeting with an investor today, and we could use someone to serve coffee and water. If you're willing, I can pay you fifty grand.""  
  
""That should be enough for someone like you to live on for a whole year, right?""  
  
Caden finally responded:  
  
""Elowen, you're just too stubborn. You won't take money directly, but you should at least accept payment for work, right?""  
  
I was so angry I almost laughed.  
  
""Are you two seriously that bored? I don't have time for your little rich people charity games. Stay away from me.""  
  
I'd specifically turned down several major surgeries to squeeze out these three days for Jasper's summer vacation.  
  
And they wanted me to serve coffee? Absolutely ridiculous.  
  
My repeated refusals made Caden's face darken, and even the usually composed Isolde couldn't help rolling her eyes.  
  
The crowd around us started murmuring:  
  
""Caden, this woman's broke and stubborn as hell. You really want her serving that VIP guest?""  
  
""I'd just drop it. If she pisses off the wrong person, we'll all be screwed.""  
  
The staff member panicked and quickly called security:  
  
""Get her out of here! The investor pitch is about to start, and that guest in the penthouse suite could come down any minute.""  
  
He glared at me through gritted teeth:  
  
""Ma'am, today's guests are all Manhattan's elite! Especially that young heir from the Lark family in Boston—he even brought his wife and kid. This is the biggest event our hotel has ever hosted!""  
  
""Usually, I might look the other way when you dig through trash, maybe even give you some cardboard to sell. But not today! You causing a scene will ruin the hotel's reputation with the elite from both cities!""  
  
""That's not something a lowly staff member like me can handle... Please, I'm begging you, just leave.""  
  
The security guards immediately moved forward to physically drag me away.  
  
I struggled free: ""I can walk myself out!""  
  
Seeing that I was finally leaving, everyone in the lobby let out a collective sigh of relief.  
  
""Wait!""  
  
Caden suddenly shouted.  
  
His eyes were fixed on the shells in my hand, his fists clenched so tight at his sides that his knuckles had turned white.  
  
""Elowen,"" his voice was hoarse, ""why don't you get it... I don't need these shells anymore.""

1lqvhp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenAIWriters/comments/1lqvhp2/the_one_he_let_go/,The One he let go,"Title: The Last Invitation
Chapter One: Almost Forever
At thirty-four, Leah Ramos had built a life of quiet victories. A top-tier lawyer in her province, she carried herself with grace and grit—admired in the courtroom, relentless with the truth. Her world revolved around justice and logic, not fleeting affections. That was until Bryan Morales walked into a maritime legal forum in Cebu, smiled at her across a room full of strangers, and made her believe that love could be steadfast too.
Bryan, a coast guard officer based in Manila, lived by the tides. He was grounded and good-hearted, a rare mix of strength and softness. Despite their distance, they found a rhythm. Weekend visits, long-distance calls, letters tucked into travel bags. Their love survived the distance, sustained by intention.
He proposed beneath a canopy of stars in Batangas, with the waves as witness. She said yes—without a moment’s hesitation.
With two months to go before the wedding, everything was falling into place. The invitations were printed, the gown was fitted, the caterer was on standby. Leah had even memorized her vows. But fate, she would soon learn, had its own script.
 
Chapter Two: The Day the Air Changed
It was an unplanned trip to the city—an emergency court appearance. Leah saw it as a chance. She would surprise Bryan. She hadn’t seen him in weeks, and she missed him in a way that ached. She texted no one, booked her flight, and carried only her overnight bag and a box of his favorite ensaymada.
When she stepped into their shared condo, the familiar scent didn’t greet her. Instead, there was a perfume in the air she didn’t wear.
Her eyes followed a trail: a woman’s blouse, a pair of jeans, undergarments—carelessly discarded. Then laughter. Then Bryan’s voice.
Her body moved before her mind caught up. Step by step, heart cracking with each footfall. She opened the bedroom door.
Time collapsed.
Bryan was tangled in bed with a woman she’d never seen. The sheets were crumpled. His face turned pale when he saw her. The woman gasped and pulled the blanket over herself. Leah’s world tilted.
She said nothing.
She turned, walked to the living room, and sat down on the sofa like a woman in mourning. Her hands shook. But she did not cry.
 
Chapter Three: Exit Wound
Bryan came out moments later, barely dressed, lips fumbling apologies that came too late.
“Leah, please. Let me explain. It’s not what—”
She didn’t even flinch. Her fingers moved with lawyer-like precision as she typed:
“Rhea, please inform all vendors. The wedding is off. Kindly notify the guest list.”
Rhea responded instantly:
“Ma’am, what happened?”
“Just do it. Thank you.”
She stood slowly, removed the engagement ring, and placed it gently on the kitchen counter beside the untouched pastry.
“I saw enough,” she said quietly, without looking at him.
Bryan reached for her, eyes wide with desperation.
She stepped back.
“I would’ve chosen you through every season, Bryan,” she whispered. “Even when it was hard. Even when it hurt.”
She turned away. And walked out.
Not a tear fell.
 
Chapter Four: A Place to Disappear
That same night, Leah booked a one-way flight to Thailand. She didn’t pack much. She needed distance, not distractions.
She arrived to silence. A rented villa hugged by the sea became her refuge. She turned off her phone. She erased reminders of what was supposed to be. The days melted together—mornings in solitude, afternoons with books, nights with the crashing waves as her only company.
She cried once. Alone, by the shore. And then, never again.
Love, she realized, was not always about holding on. Sometimes, it was the courage to release. To unlove. To begin again with yourself.
In her journal, she wrote:
“I did not lose him. He lost me. And I gained myself.”
Slowly, breath by breath, Leah remembered who she was before love asked her to shrink.
 
Chapter Five: The Return
Two weeks later, Leah flew back home.
Her parents met her at the airport, arms open, eyes warm but heavy. That night, over quiet cups of tea, she told them everything. The betrayal. The moment she walked away. The way she didn’t shed a single tear.
They listened in silence. Her mother touched her hand. Her father sat still for a long while before saying, “You did what you had to do.”
They were heartbroken, yes, but not for the wedding that wouldn’t happen. They were heartbroken for their daughter—for the weight she had carried alone, for the love that betrayed her. But they understood. And they stood by her.
Leah returned to her law firm as though nothing had changed. Her name was still on the door. Her mind, sharper than ever. Her poise, unshaken. No one dared ask questions. She was Leah Ramos—the woman who could silence a courtroom with one look. And now, the woman who had chosen herself.
She hadn’t heard from Bryan. She had blocked him on every platform. In her world, he no longer existed.
But a week after she disappeared, he had gone to her parents’ home.
He arrived with guilt carved into his face, begging for a second chance. Apologizing for what couldn’t be undone. Her parents, ever gracious, let him speak. But when he asked if they could help him reach Leah, her father simply said, “That’s no longer our place.”
A few days later, Leah received a call from a number she almost ignored. It was Bryan’s father.
His voice broke as he spoke.
“She was supposed to be part of our family,” he said. “I thought of her as a daughter already. I’m so sorry. I wish my son had been man enough to deserve her.”
Leah felt a lump rise in her throat.
“I wish things had ended differently,” she said softly. “Your family was almost mine. I wish it hadn’t ended like this.”
They sat in the silence together, two hearts grieving something that almost was.
And when the call ended, Leah felt no rage. No regret.
Only a quiet peace that came from knowing she had done the hardest thing: she had walked away from someone she once believed was her forever—and never once looked back.
 
Chapter Six: The Unseen Distance
Two years had passed.
Leah had become a name in legal circles far beyond the province. Her reputation as a sharp, ethical, and fearless attorney had traveled with her to the capital. She had taken a leap—and stayed in Manila this time. Her name appeared in legal publications, her photos in national newspapers, her voice in televised interviews.
And yet, the name she never mentioned still followed her—in whispers, in memories, in old corners of a closed heart.
She had not heard from Bryan since that call from his father. No messages, no emails, no missed calls. Nothing. She had erased him—and he never tried to come back.
But Bryan watched from afar.
He read every article that mentioned her. He paused whenever he saw her face on TV, muted everything else just to hear her speak. He followed her success like a ghost tracking sunlight—never close enough to feel its warmth, but always near enough to know it was real.
He had loved her—still did. But he had taken her for granted. He had believed her love could withstand the worst of him. That a mistake, even one as grave as betrayal, could be forgiven because her heart was kind.
But it hadn’t been enough.
He had cried for months. Lost weight. Lost sleep. Dated other women to fill the silence. But every time, he found himself comparing them to Leah—and every time, they fell short.
He never reached out again. Not because he didn’t want to. But because he knew—deep down—that Leah was the kind of woman you only got one chance with. And he had thrown his away.
He had loved her. But she had loved herself more.
And in that, he finally understood what it meant to lose something truly irreplaceable.
He still kept the engagement ring and their wedding bands—untouched, resting in the drawer of his office desk. A private altar of regret. And in his personal shelf, framed quietly behind a certificate of commendation, was the photo from the night of the proposal. Leah had said yes, her eyes brimming with joy. He had never felt more complete. And yet, he had broken what he thought was unbreakable.
 
Chapter Seven: The Quiet Between
Leah remained single. Two years after the heartbreak, the space beside her was still empty—and by choice.
She had tried. A handful of dates. Coffee with colleagues. Short conversations over dinners. But none of them ever made it to a third. Sometimes it was the way a man dismissed a waitress, or how he interrupted her mid-sentence. Other times it was subtler—an arrogance in posture, or a lack of curiosity about the world. Each red flag reminded her of the one time she ignored them all.
And she vowed never again.
Men admired her, yes. Some even fell in love with her quiet strength, her brilliance, her elegance. But Leah had turned her love inward. She had her work, her clients, her advocacy. She had found peace in the life she had built—and didn’t feel the absence of someone else to make it whole.
She didn’t need saving. She had saved herself.
Meanwhile, Bryan had slowly picked up the pieces of his own life.
He had worked hard, taken difficult posts, showed maturity in his silence. And eventually, he was promoted—youngest captain in his division. He wore the rank with humility. Led with clarity. He had become the man he once promised to be.
Charming, respected, and smart—he was admired by many. But those closest to him knew he had scars he never spoke of. There was a softness in his solitude, a longing in his quiet moments. He had moved forward, yes. But some part of him still stood in that room where Leah had placed the ring on the counter and walked away.
He didn’t chase her anymore. But he never stopped remembering.
 
Chapter Eight: The Unexpected Room
When the invitation reached Leah’s office to speak about maritime laws for new coast guard recruits, she almost declined. She had delegated most of her public speaking engagements to colleagues. But her friend and fellow attorney had a family emergency and requested Leah to take her place.
The speaker list still bore her colleague’s name.
On the day of the seminar, Leah arrived at the venue with calm professionalism. She had no idea Bryan was inside.
Bryan, on the other hand, had also come prepared—but not for this. He had no idea that Leah was the speaker. The printed program in his hand still bore her colleague’s name.
He stood near the entrance of the function hall when one of his junior officers approached, beaming.
“Sir Bryan, the guest lawyer just arrived. Would you like to meet her before the talk?”
“Of course,” he said, nodding.
The door opened, and in walked Leah—poised, calm, stunning in her quiet authority.
Their eyes locked.
For a moment, time faltered. The junior officer, oblivious, gestured between them.
“Captain Bryan Morales, this is Attorney Leah Ramos, our speaker for the session.”
They shook hands.
As if they were strangers.
As if they didn’t share a past so heavy it once tried to crush them both.
Their hands met briefly—hers steady, his cold.
And then, she smiled the kind of smile that hides a storm.
“Pleasure to meet you, Captain,” she said.
Bryan nodded. “Likewise, Counsel.”
And the room, filled with people and light, suddenly felt too small for the weight of everything unspoken.
For the first time in years, the past stood still between them—breathing, waiting.

Chapter Seven: The First Time They Met
Leah had just passed the bar when she was invited to attend a maritime legal forum in Cebu. It was her first major professional gathering, and she entered the conference room with careful confidence.
The forum welcomed both legal practitioners and uniformed personnel. Leah, young but sharp, stood out not for flair but for her quiet authority. In law school, she had been known for her discipline and sharp mind. She favored late-night study groups over parties, and her professors remembered her for her poise and eloquence.
She took her seat near the aisle, flipping through the program silently.
Bryan was already there—part of the coast guard delegation. He’d noticed her the moment she walked in. Something about the way she held herself, like she didn’t need to prove anything. He found himself choosing a seat beside her without thinking.
“Bryan Morales,” he offered casually, extending a hand. “Coast guard.”
She looked up, gave a small nod. “Leah Ramos. Lawyer.”
Throughout the sessions, they exchanged thoughts. A quiet comment here. A shared chuckle at a dry maritime case joke. They debated cordially. Agreed passionately. A rhythm began.
Coffee during the break turned into a long conversation. He asked her what pushed her into law. She asked him why he chose the coast guard. By the end of the day, the connection felt seamless.
When he asked for her number, she hesitated—but not for long.
And three months later, after long calls, ferry visits, and shared silences, she said yes.
Beneath the orange sky in Dumaguete, she had whispered it, and he had smiled like a man who just found home.
Chapter Eight: The Lecture
Leah stood confidently at the podium, the sunlight filtering through the training room’s wide windows casting a soft glow on her figure. Her black blazer fit perfectly—polished, sharp, dignified. She opened her presentation with quiet authority.
“Good morning. Today, we’ll discuss the core tenets of maritime law and its application in humanitarian operations. Specifically, how your duties intersect with legal accountability.”
Bryan sat in the front row, stone still.
She spoke with clarity and insight. Her voice was steady, each point carefully layered over the last. She used real-life case studies—some drawn from coastal disaster responses, others from fisheries enforcement. She transitioned from local to international protocols, her articulation smooth, her presence commanding.
The young recruits scribbled notes eagerly. Some looked at her in awe. Even the senior officers listened intently.
But Bryan?
He was somewhere else.
He watched the way her brow furrowed slightly when explaining legal ambiguity. The way her fingers gestured subtly when drawing connections between statutes. The quiet smile she allowed when someone asked an insightful question.
She had grown into someone more brilliant, more graceful, more formidable than even he remembered.
And it hit him hard—how had he let this woman slip through his hands?
He remembered her laughter. The way she used to rest her head on his shoulder during long drives. The handwritten notes she left in his locker. Her dreams. Her strength.
And now, here she was. Speaking of the law with power and clarity, untouched by the pain he had caused, untouched by him.
She wasn’t his anymore.
And perhaps, she never would be again.
Chapter 9- the wedding
A small garden ceremony. Leah walks down the aisle in a flowing white dress. The world is silent except for her footsteps. He stands at the altar, dressed in his formal white uniform, waiting. Their friends and families fill the seats. Music swells.
She reaches him. Smiling.
The officiant begins.
Leah looks at him with tear-filled eyes and begins her vows:
“Bryan,
Today, I become your wife. I write these words believing in the forever we dream of.
I vow to be your partner in every storm, your anchor when the tides are rough, your light when the world dims. I choose you every day, even when love feels like work.
I promise to listen—to your voice, your fears, your silence. I walk beside you, not behind, not ahead. Together.
You are not perfect, and neither am I. But I believe we are perfect for each other. I am ready to fight for us.
To build a home filled with warmth, music, and laughter.
I stand beside you, in every season, in every loss, in every triumph.
And I call that life, my great adventure.”

Then his turn.
“Leah,
You walk into my life like a quiet promise, and suddenly I know—this is it.
I vow to hold your hand when it trembles, and steady your heart when it doubts. I vow to honor your strength and be a safe place for your softness.
I stand behind you when you lead, beside you when you fall, and in front of you when life demands a shield.
You are my calm in the storm, my fire in the cold. I carry our love gently, fiercely, truthfully.
If ever I fail, I never stop trying.
I dream of growing old with you—of grey hairs, wrinkled hands, and the peace of knowing we make it.”
“And now,” the officiant says, “you may kiss the bride.”
He leans forward, heart full.

And the vision shatters.
Back in the room, Leah continues to speak. Bryan blinks hard, disoriented. The recruits clap lightly at a point she’s just made.
She isn’t his bride.
She is the woman he once loves—and loses.

The food scene on July 3rd, 2025, presented a diverse mix of news, ranging from global recognition for Indian ice cream to the health implications of a trendy beverage. Here's a comprehensive overview of the key developments:

**Indian Ice Cream Takes Center Stage:**

A highlight of the day was the international acclaim bestowed upon Indian ice cream. TasteAtlas, a renowned global food and travel guide, released its ranking of the world's top 100 iconic frozen desserts, with five Indian ice creams making the cut. This recognition signifies a growing appreciation for the unique flavors and traditions that define Indian frozen treats.

The success of these ice creams is attributed to several factors. They showcase not only the use of regional ingredients, reflecting the diverse culinary landscape of India, but also a nostalgic charm and a blend of traditional and innovative approaches to dessert making. While Italy’s Vivoli Gelateria topped the list with its classic Crema, India’s presence was notable. One example highlighted was Rustom & Co.’s Mango Ice Cream Sandwich, lauded for its creamy mango filling encased in crisp biscuit layers, a treat that has consistently delighted generations.

This recognition underscores a broader trend: the global food community’s increasing openness to exploring and appreciating diverse culinary traditions. The success of Indian ice cream, much like the rise of other ethnic cuisines, speaks to a consumer demand for authenticity, quality ingredients, and a connection to the cultural heritage embedded in food.

**Ghee Coffee's Growing Popularity and Health Considerations:**

Another notable development in the food world is the continued rise in popularity of ghee coffee, also known as bulletproof coffee. This beverage, a combination of coffee and ghee (clarified butter), has found traction among those following ketogenic or low-carb diets. Proponents claim that ghee coffee provides sustained energy, supports weight loss, and enhances mental clarity.

However, the widespread adoption of this trend raises important questions about its long-term effects. Consultant dietician and diabetes educator Kanikka Malhotra emphasized the need to understand the potential impacts of regular ghee coffee consumption. She noted that ghee contains important fatty acids, such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which have been linked to various health benefits, including reduced body fat and improved weight management. However, she did not specify details on her perspective or concerns with regular consumption.

The interest in ghee coffee reflects broader trends in food and health. The pursuit of optimized performance and specific dietary regimes, coupled with the availability of numerous sources of health and wellness information, has driven demand for such specialized food and drink. As more people experiment with unique ingredients and dietary practices, understanding the scientific basis of those practices and the potential benefits and risks becomes increasingly important.

**Embracing Comfort and Convenience in the Kitchen:**

Beyond specific trends, the news also highlighted the growing demand for comfort and convenience in the kitchen. A new season of the ""Comfort Eating"" podcast, hosted by Grace Dent, was announced, with celebrity guests set to discuss life through the lens of food. This reflects the broader trend of food as a social, emotional, and cultural connector.

Adding to this idea of convenience, The Guardian Feast app was promoted as a resource. This app provides users with access to a vast library of expert recipes, designed to simplify meal preparation and reduce stress in the kitchen. With features like cook mode, search by collection and save for later, the app allows users to organize and follow recipes easily. This emphasizes the idea of ease and accessibility.

**Conclusion:**

The food news from July 3rd, 2025, paints a picture of a dynamic and evolving landscape. The global recognition of Indian ice cream demonstrates a growing appreciation for diverse culinary traditions. Simultaneously, the popularity of ghee coffee exemplifies the continuing trend of consumers seeking out functional foods that offer targeted health benefits. Finally, initiatives like the ""Comfort Eating"" podcast and The Guardian Feast app reveal a growing demand for comforting, convenient, and accessible culinary experiences, catering to a world where food plays an increasingly important role in our lives, from cultural expression to individual wellbeing.

I built a free app called **BackyardMN** that helps people in the Twin Cities meet up in small groups (usually 3-4 people) to hang out—like go on walks, grab coffee, hit up a bookstore, etc.

It’s super simple:

* You enter your name, location, and what you want to do right now.
* It matches you with a few others nearby who want to do the same thing.
* You all get placed in a group chat so you can meet up.

I made this app because I was feeling isolated—and realized a lot of people at UofMn were feeling the same way. Dating apps felt weird. Meetup groups felt too formal. I just wanted a way to casually make new friends.

**If you're in Dinkytown, Stadium Village, or nearby, give it a shot this week!** The more people on it, the better the experience.

I (19M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (21F) for almost 2 years.

When we met everything was perfect, the honeymoon phase, we almost didn’t fight and if we did it was about stuff that wasn’t really relevant. 

However, with time going by, other stuff started happening, i’m a really chill person and hate fighting, i just like being in peace and avoid it as much as i can, but i started noticing that when we don’t have compatible opinions when talking, either about something irrelevant, politics, etc, she used to have/ has that “always right mentality” (she admitted it herself that before she met me, if someone didn’t agree with her she didn’t care and she only cared about her opinion).

That’s something that really started bothering me, and i told her many times that i can’t be in a relationship like this for the rest of my life, she told me she was going to work on it but couldn’t do it in one day, but it’s been almost one year and there’s not much progress at all, when can talk better but she still can’t respect when i don’t agree.

She’s also really negative and tends to take it out on everyone around her, i am there for her but also keep telling her that everyone has bad days, and that she can’t take out her problems on others, something i never did to her, but it still happens after a few weeks/days.

I also don’t feel like i can tell her stuff anymore, for example, a few months ago my dad got jumped by a few immigrants who moved recently, on a coffee i’ve been going to for years, something that can happen anywhere and i’ve never had trouble on that coffee particularly, after i told her, meaning to rant about it, 5 minutes later an argument raised because she started telling me i shouldn’t be going to places like that and it has a bad look and stuff like that.

I’ve gotten to the point where i’m just tired, I really like her and i’ve been with quite a few girls before her, but she’s my first girlfriend and the first girl i really loved that way, and that’s what is making it hard.

I keep having those thoughts that i can’t deal with this any longer, however i also keep thinking, what if i regret it in a few months?

Did anyone else experience these thoughts before they broke up with someone? How are you doing today?

1lqv6fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1lqv6fo/burnout_following_difficult_roommate_situation/,Burnout following difficult roommate situation,"I believe I'm currently experiencing autistic burnout following a difficult roommate situation. In November, my partner and I took in a roommate when a friend of ours was facing homelessness. We don't have a spare bedroom, so they took the living room. This person has ADHD and is additionally extremely inconsiderate to live with, so there was a big disruption in terms of hygiene and sensory. I was frequently having to clean up after this person or just accept that the house would stay messy; if we confronted the roommate, they would start crying about how they were not good enough. There were tons of small and big disruptions to my routine. Basically my home went from a place that was clean and regimented to haphazard, sloppy, and smelly. I also have health and contamination OCD, and this was exacerbated tenfold by the person's lousy hygiene.

Additionally, our roommate eventually did find a job, claim they didn't have enough to move out, and then bought themselves a $1000 gaming setup. Eventually they lost their job and made no real effort to move out or find a new one--though they claimed to be doing both, but they also tended to lie a lot in really obvious ways--so I kicked them out. I don't really feel bad about this.

I have noticed over the past several months that I've become a lot more irritable, having more frequent meltdowns, forgetting things, and taking longer on cognitive skills like solving math problems. I am also struggling more with spoken word (written word and typing remains okay). Yesterday I was very concerned because I set my calendar wrong and put my coffee in the wrong part of my kitchen. These behaviors just aren't like me. At first, I was concerned my cognitive limitations, forgetfulness, and irritability could be evidence of something neurological. On the one hand, I'm 33 and there's no history of Alzheimer's or dementia in my family. On the other, I have had repeated concussions and head injuries due to my meltdowns, and I suffer from migraines. I've taken online tests to try to gauge cognitive limitation, however, and all of them show that there is none.

I'm concerned that what might be happening is that I've developed autistic burnout after months of stress due to the roommate situation. I went from having an extremely regimented and quiet life working from home to living with someone loud, smelly, inconsiderate, and unhygienic, who disrupted my routine in every possible way you can think of, only to take advantage of the situation and buy themselves nice things while living on my couch and overwhelming my life. I'm not really sure how to bounce back from this, especially given that I also work full-time and have a child to look after. I can't take time off work, because I just got back from vacation--this did not help at all; vacations are so stressful for me--and I am having surgery in August. I need tips on what to do in the meantime while adhering to my obligations.",2,1751562916.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

I live between München and Starnberg and would love to meet someone nearby who’s ready for something real. Life feels more meaningful when it's shared with the right person. And, that’s what I’m hoping to find.

I’m tall (187 cm), with dark hair and blue eyes. I’ve got a strong build with a bit of softness in the middle. I’m also on the hairier side, just being honest right from the start. :)

I enjoy the simple things: quiet walks in nature, slow mornings, good food, and spending time with people who make me feel at ease. I speak English, German, and Turkish. I’m into anime, manga, and board games. So yes, you could say that I’m a bit nerdy.

What matters most to me is connection, both emotional and physical. I usually feel that spark more with women who are naturally slim, fit, or have an average build. That’s just me being honest about what I’m drawn to, not trying to be selective.

There’s one thing I want to be upfront about: I’d love to have a child of my own one day. I know that’s a big thing to share early, but I think it’s important to speak from the heart.

I’m not looking for endless texting or something long-distance. I’d much rather meet in person, have a coffee or tea, take a walk, and see how we vibe.

Turns out she was looking at her phone while walking and walked into men's bathroom instead of women's bathroom. She quickly noticed it and barged out very quickly but it was really embrassing for both of us. I decided to do my thing quickly and get out of that place as soon as possible. The moment I stepped out, the girl came to me, she said she was sorry for what she did and told me what really happened. After that she asked me about my whereabouts (about where I was from and which class I am from bla bla bla). She then offered me a cup of coffee, I declined first but she was urging me and said to me to take it as a sorry gift from her. I finnaly agreed (A little cup of coffee won't hurt, right?). We went to a nearby cafe inside the mall and she bought me a cup of coffee. We then chatted for a little while. After I finished the coffee, she paid for the coffee and said to me that she have to go to somewhere. Before going, she asked my insta ID and I gave it to her and after that, she went on her own way.

1lqv5gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lqv5gg/does_the_bodum_bistro_electric_kettle_deliver/,Does the Bodum Bistro Electric Kettle Deliver Rapid Boil Efficiency?,"The Bodum 11451-01US bistro electric water kettle has been part of my daily routine for about a month now. As someone who loves a good cup of tea or instant coffee to kickstart the morning, an efficient and safe kettle has always been on my must-have list. This compact, 17-ounce marvel quickly proved itself as more than just an ordinary appliance; it's a staple that my kitchen was missing. Its rapid-boil functionality has been a game-changer, especially during rushed mornings or late nights when I needed boiling water in a pinch. But not everything is perfect here, and there are a few things worth considering for prospective buyers.

**Elegant Design That Fits Small Spaces Well**  
What first grabbed my attention was the kettle's sleek and modern design. Between its compact dimensions—standing at just 7.75 inches tall—and its lightweight build of 1.06 pounds, the appliance fits neatly on my tiny kitchen counter without taking over the space. The black BPA-free plastic finish is understated yet stylish, blending effortlessly with my kitchen decor. Its clear water-level indicator, which features cup-serving sizes, is a thoughtful touch for practicality. Plus, the tactile on/off button on the handle feels intuitive to use. However, its handle positioning can feel slightly cramped for larger hands.  

[View Bodum 11451-01US sale info on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b00851lrr6/)  

**Ease of Use and Quick Results**  
This electric kettle stands out for its simplicity. With a manual on/off switch and power indicator light, it doesn’t try to overwhelm you with unnecessary features. Once switched on, the water boils in about four minutes, and let me just say, this is exactly as fast as advertised. Whether whipping up a mug of green tea or prepping instant noodles, I’ve rarely had to wait longer than expected. The anti-boil dry technology and steam sensor were reassuring safety features, especially since I sometimes find myself distracted while multitasking in the kitchen.  

**Winning Points**  
- Compact and lightweight design ideal for small spaces like dorms, RVs, or apartments.  
- Fast boiling speed that saves time.  
- BPA-free plastic construction ensures safer use.  
- Automatic shut-off for peace of mind.  

**Key drawbacks to consider**  
While the Bodum 11451-01US electric kettle is excellent in many ways, there are minor inconveniences to note. First off, the 17-ounce capacity may not suit families or heavy tea drinkers. It’s barely enough for two generous cups, so if you plan to use this for multiple servings often, you might find it slightly limiting. Moreover, since it’s designed for handwashing only, cleaning can be tedious; the kettle’s compact spout doesn’t allow easy access to its interior. And while not necessarily a dealbreaker, I’ve noticed that the cord feels relatively short, which can restrict placement flexibility in your kitchen.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Limited capacity: better suited for one or two people than larger households.  
- Manual cleaning can be cumbersome.  
- A shorter cord restricts placement near power outlets.  

**Performance Compared to Others**  
I’ve owned and tested other kettles, including some with stainless-steel bodies and larger capacities, so I couldn’t help but compare this model to ones like the Hamilton Beach Glass Kettle or the Cuisinart CPK-17. In contrast to stainless steel designs, this kettle feels noticeably lighter and slightly less durable. The Hamilton Beach model, for example, offers a larger capacity and a more premium glass body, but it lacks the buffer against accidental breakage that BPA-free plastic provides. Meanwhile, the Cuisinart kettle boasts multiple temperature settings, a feature absent here, but its price point is significantly higher. The Bodum 11451-01US holds its ground in terms of focused efficiency, particularly for single users or small households who value speed over advanced customizations.

**Affordable Quality Worth Considering**  
This kettle feels fairly priced when weighed against its feature set. Its blend of practicality, safety, and ease of use hits the mark for its intended audience. Sure, it’s not the largest or most feature-packed option, but if you’re shopping for a compact model with rapid heating and reliable safety mechanisms, this strikes a great balance. On top of being budget-friendly, it caters well to minimalists or those dwelling in smaller spaces like apartments or RVs.

1lqv50q,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lqv50q/rf_it_was_a_creepy_abandoned_building_where_a_kid/,"[RF] It was a creepy abandoned building where a kid was murdered, until Kevin creatively reinvented it","
“You’re living at the old paper mill!?” I asked. “Like, that haunted old concrete warehouse we’d sneak into in high school?”

“Yup. That one. But it’s not actually haunted you know,” Kevin grinned, as we walked up the sandy bike trail through the woods. 

I just moved back home after a failed 5 year attempt at making it in the big city. While I was able to actually use my degree as a therapist at a counseling center, the cost of living there made me feel like I was constantly drowning. So I’m back home for now, reconnecting with old friends while I figure out my next move. 

“Here it is,” said Kevin, as we emerged through some thick brush onto the old overgrown parking lot of the building. It was just as I remembered it. From the front, a sprawling single story of chunky concrete and block covered in several generations of graffiti and moss. 

Back in high school, Kevin always took the unconventional path. He was the first of our group to get into weed (back when it was still illegal.) And I’ll never forget the time he bought Salvia and we smoked it in his parents basement. Geesh…

“The township put the property up for sale a few years back. But I had too many memories here to let it get bulldozed and replaced with another soulless apartment building,” he explained. 

He led us through the main entry, which was no longer boarded up. As we came inside, I felt the air shift cooler, but it wasn’t as dark as I remembered. The boards and windows along the main hallway had been removed, allowing fresh air and light to flow through. Already it felt less creepy and more inviting. But there was still the haunting story that lingered in the back of my mind the whole time. 

“Of course I couldn’t afford to buy it, but I stirred up all the local artists and non-profits behind a vision of restoring the place into a kind of community art studio. We used all the trendy buzz words to pitch it to the township board; ‘building local culture’, ‘promoting tourism’, ‘sustainable design’, shit like that.”

The hallway opened up to a big empty main room. In the center was a collection of plastic swimming pools, cans, and totes, all filled with water which dripped down from a large broken skylight above. 

“Fortunately, Matt Brown… you remember him from school? …just got elected to the board, and he was sympathetic and able to sway the town over to our cause,” Kevin explained.

On a wooden table built from plywood and two by fours, was a plastic bin filled with old coffee mugs, dirty spoons, and bowls caked with oatmeal. 

“Don’t mind the mess, this is just my makeshift dish pit because it’s the only source of water in the building. Most of my work is downstairs,” Kevin explained, leading us towards the dark stairwell. 

While the building appeared to be one story from the front, it was actually three or four levels embedded into a steep hillside which sloped down towards a mucky wetland area in the back. I think that’s part of why it felt so creepy. It was like we were descending into a cave. It didn’t help that there were no lights, besides the open windows and dinky flashlight Kevin carried. 

I couldn’t resist any longer, I had to bring up the story. “Don’t you ever get creeped out, being here? You know, because of when someone found that kid's pinky finger in the muck out back. I think it happened in the 90s right? And it turned out he was murdered by his mom when they were squatting here! Yikes… And remember how we’d scare the girls we brought here, by pretending to see the kids ghost, then chase them around in the dark,” I grinned.  

I saw Kevin smiling too, in the dim bouncing light in the stairwell. 

“Yeah, that’s how most people remember this place these days. But I’m trying to change that story. It’s part of the whole art project,” he shared, as we reached the bottom level. 

Surprisingly, bright sunlight was pouring from the room at the end of the hallway. As we headed towards it, we passed by several smaller empty rooms. I forgot just how big and empty this place was. I guess Kevin would say it’s full of potential. 

“The part of the story most people forget is that the mom had severe mental health issues,” Kevin continued. “Remember how the local insane asylum was closed down in the 1980s, and they kicked out all the residents? Without the support they needed to survive, many of them became homeless. She was one of them. I’m not excusing what she did, but just adding important context.” 

His words made me feel a little guilty for treating it like a spooky ghost story this whole time, forgetting the human dimensions. As we neared the end room, I noticed some of the side rooms had things in them. One was filled with old furniture. Another held a bunch of rugs and carpets all rolled up, leaning against the concrete walls. 

“Lewis Sloan.” 

“Huh?”

“That was the boy's name. Lewis Sloan.”

“Oh, got it. Sorry,” I replied.

“No need to be sorry. It’s not your fault. But we can do a better job to remember him, without making his story central to this whole project.”

“Right,” I agreed, shifting my weight unsteadily.  

We stopped just outside the illuminated room. Through the door I could see the walls covered in bookshelves, surrounding a comfy looking old sofa. 

Kevin turned to the wall in the hallway. Looking up, I saw a configuration of soft driftwood mounted on a large corkboard. The driftwood formed the shape of a kid, leaping from a log (made of moss) to grab a branch. Along the bottom, many small twigs were carefully cut and glued together to spell out; “In Memory of Lewis Sloan. 1989-1994”

“I just finished this piece, made out of driftwood I pulled from the muck out back,” explained Kevin, with a kind of solemn reverence. “And I got the poison ivy rash to prove it!” He lifted his pant leg revealing a large swollen red patch of bumpy skin.

This moment touched me. I’d never seen this side of Kevin before. I just remembered his wild cynical side back in our school days. Never serious, always making absurd jokes. But this was a more mature version of him that I couldn’t help but admire. 

“Alright, now moving on from that… welcome to the Dungeon of Artful Delights!” Kevin announced, stepping boldly into the final room. 

This room was larger than the rest, with a high ceiling. Sunlight streamed in through the tall vertical windows in the back wall. The other walls were covered with bookshelves, filled with old faded books. A patchwork of colorful rugs and chunks of carpet covered the floor, softening the brutal concrete feel. The center looked like a makeshift living room. A number of comfy looking old sofas surrounded a large sturdy coffee table covered in papers, brushes, pens, and other crafty artifacts. 
 
“All these books I collected over time from local libraries and bookstores. The rejects destined for recycling. Now they’re helping to warm up the space, both literally and figuratively. They help insulate the room from the cold concrete walls. Plus they look nicer, and provide an endless resource to jog the imagination if you ever get a creative block,” Kevin explained, waltzing casually through the space. 

I tilted my head to read a book title on the shelf near me; “The Human Predicament: Dissolution and Wholeness by George W. Morgan, 1971” 

“Huh. Yeah I could spend a lot of time in here… like a cave explorer excavating hidden gems.” I said, as I skimmed through the fragile yellowed pages. 

“And I just got this off-grid power setup working too!” he shared, excitedly switching a lamp on and off in the corner. Its power cord traced along the bottom corner of the wall, to a small plastic box; the battery bank, I presumed. More cords traced from the box out through the nearest window. 

“Now come, check out the atrium!” Kevin’s enthusiasm was infectious. Bringing the space to life. 

He opened one of the tall windows, and we climbed awkwardly through it out to a space about as big as a basketball court. It was surrounded on three sides by the tall exterior walls of the building, open to the sky above, allowing many small trees and plants to grow from the cracks in the concrete floor. 

One of the sides was open, facing downhill towards the wetland. I could already smell the earthy muck. It wasn’t bad though. There was a faint whiff of spearmint too, which reminded me of my childhood visits to small inland lakes. We would rub it all over ourselves trying to ward off the mosquitos. 

“One of my friends, Maren, has started trying to grow things here,” Kevin explained, gesturing to a few small mounds of earth on top of the concrete. In one of the beds, several scraggly tomato plants were starting to grow, amongst a thick bed of greens.

“Lambsquarters,” said Kevin, breaking off a bit of the greenery and handing it to me. “It’s basically a weed, but it’s edible.” 

I hesitated, examining the leaves. They were covered in a white dust that almost seemed to sparkle. “Is this going to get me high?” I asked. 

“Hah, no. It’s not that kind of weed,” Kevin answered. “That’s over there…” he gestured at a sunny patch of tall weeds tucked into a corner. And eating those wouldn’t do much anyways. You can think of lambsquarters kind of like a wild spinach.”  

With a little reluctance, I bit a few of the leaves off and chewed. It wasn’t exactly tasty, but wasn’t bad either. The taste was probably closest to raw spinach, like he said. 

“Thanks. Not bad. Could use a bit of salt and butter though,” I shared, swallowing. I decided not to take another bite, but held onto the rest. 

“Maren explained to me how this is actually a pretty good spot for growing things because the hill faces south, so it gets a good amount of sunlight. Plus, the muck in the wetland has excellent fertility so she hauls buckets of it up here to build these growing beds.” 

For a moment, my mind drifted back to the disembodied finger found back there. I started imagining it rotting in the muck, covered in worms and maggots. But then I remembered the driftwood sculpture Kevin had made. The image of Lewis playing. The abandonment of those, like his mom, who needed help and support. And the place was beginning to take on a new, deeper meaning for me. 

“Oh and these trees growing in the cracks are mulberries, so in another few weeks they’ll be loaded with tasty berries!” Kevin shared, as we walked under a healthy looking tree that was about 15 or 20 feet tall.
Looking back towards the room we came from, I saw two solar panels propped up at an angle facing the sun, their wires tracing back inside through the window.

“This is really cool, man! I love what you’re doing here!” 
His enthusiasm had infected me. Any residual sense of the spooky past had been fully washed away by this point; replaced with an exciting sense of creative potential. 

“Maybe in the future some part of this project could serve to help those with mental health issues,” I suggested. 

Kevin grinned, “Maybe that’s why you’re here.”

“Oh, uh I don’t know…” I stammered. I just got back home. I wasn’t ready to commit to something like that yet. 

“There’s lots of extra space, as you saw. And you can’t beat the rent. Just a hundred bucks a year,” he explained. 

“Nah, I really… Wait, did you say $100 for a whole year?” I asked.

“Yep. It’s mainly just to cover the basic fees and insurance.”

I thought about it for a minute. It would be nice to get out of my parents house. As much as I love them, I also can’t stand living with them… I’d definitely be roughing it if I lived here, but it’s the summer ‘and living is easy.’ I could always go back to the parents’ place once the weather turns cold. Who knows, this could be a cool way to get reconnected in town. 

“You know what. Maybe I will. Let me sleep on it,” I said. 

“Cool man. You’re welcome to crash on a couch here to get a feel for it too.”

I looked back down at the greens in my hand. Lambsquarters, that’s what he called it. 
“Ah, what the hell. Why not,” I said, taking another big bite of the bitter greens, chewing and swallowing them with enthusiasm. 

“Hell yeah!” said Kevin. “I’ll call up Maren and a few other friends you should meet. They’ll bring their instruments too. It’ll be a good night,” He smiled. 

For the first time since I can remember, I actually felt a tiny glimmer of hope about the future. Maybe moving back home was the right move after all.

TW: murder, blood, suicidal ideation (vaguely, but still present), themes of death

———

Seventeen-year-old Draven Vale never asked to be brought back to life. He never asked to be a detective for Death. But drowning in a lake seemed a poor alternative to Death’s blood-inked deal: in exchange for his life, Draven must solve classmate Julian Mallory’s murder within one year. 

Now, autumn has returned. Draven’s deadline is a month away. Fueled only by coffee and desperation, Draven is running out of leads and red thread for his stringboard. But when a ouija board séance goes wrong, Julian possesses Draven’s body. The boys are forced into a begrudging detective partnership. 

Julian is everything Draven isn’t: tender, justice-driven, and bizarrely *alive* for a half-dead boy. Naturally, the two clash almost as often as they cooperate. What starts as a simple investigation spirals into something far darker, a mystery spiderwebbed with ghosts and secret societies, and Draven must decide what he’s really willing to sacrifice—for answers, for the living, and for the dead.

⸻

🎬 Scene: Interior Coffee Shop

[Jake is sipping a cold brew, scrolling on his phone. Amir enters wearing red, white, and blue face paint, holding yet another scroll—it’s clearly just computer paper taped end to end with crayon writing.]

Amir (slaps scroll on the table):
Scroll drop. Part 2. Read it and weep.

Jake (not looking up):
Amir, you can’t keep calling everything a scroll just because you tape printer paper together.

Amir (offended):
It’s scroll-shaped, it’s got a message, and it’s written by a guy with vision. That makes it a scroll.

Jake (glancing at it):
This is just “Eras Tour” written 34 times in purple marker and one very bad drawing of a soccer ball with eyelashes.

Amir (beaming):
Exactly. The scroll foretells. Read it.

⸻

📜 The Scroll: (Amir dramatically reads)

“On the day of July five,
a pop witch came alive.
Her name was T—no—Saylor Twift.
She danced so hard, she caused a rift.”

Jake:
What… kind of rift?

Amir:
A spiritual rift. Between eras. Between hearts. Between the halves of a football field.

Jake:
That’s not a rift. That’s called halftime.

⸻

“Her fans, they roared. Her merch, it soared.
She bought a soccer team, then screamed: ‘ALL ABOARD!’
They asked her name, she whispered low:
‘I’m midfield captain now. Let’s go.’”

Jake:
So you’re saying she’s coaching a soccer team now?

Amir:
Not coaching—commanding. With glitter.

Jake (deadpan):
And this… this needed to be a scroll?

Amir:
It couldn’t not be a scroll.

⸻

“With cleats of gold and mic in hand,
she kicked a ball across the land.
It hit a fan, she said ‘My bad,’
then sang a ballad so, so sad.”

Jake (groaning):
You rhymed “land” with “hand” and then just gave up.

Amir (shrugs):
Rhyming is a guideline, not a law.

⸻

“Now every match must have a song.
If it doesn’t, that’s just wrong.
The ref wears fringe, the net is lace,
and post-game snacks are… pillowcase.”

Jake:
What?! Pillowcase isn’t a food!

Amir (nodding solemnly):
It is if you’re dedicated to the bit.

⸻

Jake:
How many scrolls have you written this week?

Amir (counts on fingers):
Seven full scrolls, one limerick, and a “scroll-in-progress” about Zendaya opening a haunted candle store.

Jake:
You’re spiraling.

Amir:
I’m scrolling. There’s a difference.

⸻

📜 Bonus Scroll “Footnote” (Amir unrolls a tiny scroll from his sock)

“This message brought to you by the Scroll Council of America:
Keep scrollin’, scrollin’, scrollin’—what!”

Jake (mutters):
Did you quote Limp Bizkit at the end of a Taylor Swift soccer prophecy?

Amir (smiling):
Genre-bending. Like Saylor Twift would want.

I committed to finding a gf this year with all the zest I could muster.

Leo girl delayed meeting me for two weeks and I was prepared to write her off. When we did meet, we had immediate chemistry and I had to gently decline to see Libra girl further. Leo girl is my girlfriend now and I have had1000+ matches  and dates to get here with Leo girl.   
  
There is a lot to modern dating that men don't have explained to them in any coherent way. If I could advise my past self I would tell myself this:  
  
1. Find a hobby or passion that fills you with purpose. I love athletic stuff and it keeps my mind busy from obsessing over delays in texts or messages. Especially being fit, keeping your diet under control, taking an interest in clothing, skincare, etc., will make you stand out amongst other men. It also exponentially increases your sexual stamina and attraction. Find a group gym class and it makes it even easier: pilates, yoga and run groups are premier places to find girls and most men will not do this.   
2. Watch or read female entertainment: sex and the city has literally made me LOL so many times and it is an excellent insight into female psychology. Do not listen to the hogwash about it, which I believed from my dad for years. You need to understand how women think and feel and this kind of show is a pleasure to ingest. Broad City, New Girl and others are hilarious and help you to understand how women think.   
3. When you start dating and get their number, do not ask about their day, do not get to know them through text, do not send compliments. Mirror their texting, but take the lead. Do not get in your feels about their lack of texting, their lack of reciprocity, but trust your gut. You are an NPC to them and their lives. You do not ask an NPC anything except 2 lines of dialogue. They do not see you as anything except a side character until at least date 4. Go slowly, build anticipation, stand out from other men who rush to the finish line, including sex. Women want sex as much and sometimes more than men. The longer you delay sexual intercourse, the more you will stand out. Do not push more than once and if they move your hand away, do not seem into it, respect that decision. Any chance to touch them respectfully, lean into it.   
4. Have options and a backup. Do not overly invest at the start (before date 4 or 5) because they are probably seeing other people at the same time as well and expect you are too. Do not make yourself too available and only plan dates you actually enjoy: do not do the bare minimum and expect the maximum. Coffee/drink date to get to know them first and then an activity date. TEXTING MATTERS. If they have bad texting etiquette, do not respond in reasonable time (24h), do not provide personal details, they are not worth it, move on right away. To me, if they do not ask about my day twice in a row, they are messed up and are a problem. 

5. Do not compromise on chemistry. I am an Aries and have a strong personality. When you find the right person for you, it is natural, easy and fun. If you find yourself feeling uncomfortable, dreading meeting them, feel annoyed or dismayed at something they react to, do not dismiss your gut. Listen to your instincts, they are almost never wrong. Do not take it personally either: there are people out there that you will like that won't like you and ones that like you that you don't like. Be a gentleman: you never know when that girl that you do not like, has a friend that she thinks you should meet and will turn into your girlfriend (which has happened to me). The more you demonstrate gentlemanly behavior and courtesy, the higher the chances of positive returns in the future. DO NOT BE HONEST when ending it. Say you do not feel a connection and wish them luck. 

6. Read about female anatomy, physiology, psychology, seduction. Read the Art of Seduction by R. Greene and figure out your seduction style and leverage the hell out of it. I am charmer type, and learning how to use it, how to improve my communication was incredibly helpful. I do not talk about myself, keep an air of mystery, and go into their spirit. Without this strategy, you are walking into a fight with a blindfold on. Seduction is peak female warfare because men are physically dominant and so women have had the entire history to hone their skills at seduction. Men have not had to it in the same way and so it's a skillset men need to develop. Have a game plan of things you want to talk about on a date as a backup if conversations run dry. Women do not want a logical or rational discussion about things. They want a safe roller coaster where you have fun, desired and supported. I have made so many mistakes where I was overly logical when I should have been more emotional and whimsical. 

7. In the early stages of dating and a relationship, every day is dreadful. You wake up, thinking how much farther am I in my RPG relationship quest and how far you have to go. Expect your entire week to sometimes lead up to a few hours on a date. You have to tolerate that until you are exclusive. Plan creative dates and it will help you stand out like creating art classes, or activity classes and it will practically have the conversation flow itself. 

I am by no means a master at any of this, but I also have a number of other positive traits that help: I am financially secure, relatively good looking (although I am bald!), have a great career, a small amount of friends, like reading and writing. You really need to love yourself (not in a narcisstic way!) to attract someone.  Lastly, starsigns: I know it sounds dumb and probably is but honestly the best connections I have had are with signs I am naturally inclined with. I suggest screening for this early on as it also provides insights into their personality and whether you mesh well.

And you won't. I'll just have to accept that, because there is not other way to move beyond this stalemate.
I miss you, and it hurts that you don't seem to exhibit the same desperation in trying to mend what's broken. I've said some terrible things and you did some terrible things. We both kinda suck. But I would give up so much to have a tiny bit of your imperfection in my life again.
You're with someone else, you moved within the blink of an eye. A couple of weeks, only. I resented you for this. It's still really hard for me to justify your decisions, but truth is I no longer care for your relationship status.
I miss talking about our shared favourite bands, quoting from the Sopranos, asking you questions that confuse the hell out of you and enjoying the finer things in life: coffee, wine and inappropriate jokes.
This letter is not at all poetic, it doesn't compare you to the sun or the moon, but sometimes it's better not to hide behind what's beautiful and to just get to what is simple and true: I regret not supporting your new chapter in life, even though it hurt me thoroughly.

1lqv1ef,https://kauainownews.com/2025/07/03/bracing-for-the-dirtiest-beach-day-of-the-year/,Bracing for the ‘dirtiest beach day of the year’,"Aftermath of the “rocket’s red glare” and “bombs bursting in air” along with the massive amount of people who descend upon Kauaʻi beaches during the 4th of July often resembles more of a war scene like that Francis Scott Key watched as Fort McHenry in Baltimore was bombarded during the War of 1812, which inspired him to write the “Star-Spangled Banner.”

But instead of rubble, spent mortar shells, other used artillery being found strewn all over, people’s patriotic celebrations and holiday fireworks leave the island’s beaches covered in rubbish the day after.

Surfrider Kauaʻi won’t let fallout from festivities fester though.

The nonprofit Garden Isle organization is bracing for July 5 — known nationwide as the “dirtiest beach day of the year” — and it’s asking the Garden Isle community to join its ranks to clean up the impending mess.

Surfrider Kaua‘i and partners nonprofit Permanent Affordable Living Hawai‘i and Kumu Camp are looking for a few good men, women, keiki and kūpuna community to enlist — and gather some friends to do the same — for the fifth annual July 5th Beach Cleanup.

“Our local beaches are stewarded by volunteers just like you,” the organization’s [**invite**](https://volunteer.surfrider.org/timeslots/OC7NfoE80D) says. “We welcome you to an engaging day of toes in the sand with family, friends and new acquaintances, raising awareness about litter and plastic pollution.”

Clean up starts at 9 a.m. at Kumu Camp in Anahola. Gloves, trash bags, coffee and snacks will be provided, but be sure to bring sunscreen and a reusable water bottle.

A [**record-breaking 162,902 pounds of marine debris and trash were collected**](https://kauainownews.com/2025/02/26/surfrider-kauai-collects-record-162902-pounds-of-marine-debris-rubbish-in-2024/) throughout all of last year from Kaua‘i beaches.

Rubbish left behind on beaches not only looks awful, it can wash into the ocean, harming the environment including marine wildlife such as Hawai’i’s five types of sea turtles and Hawaiian monk seals, all of which are protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

Seabirds, several of which that fly in Hawai’i skies and make the islands their home share the same protection status, and coral also can be harmed by the trash.

There are even repercussions from the rubbish on public health and tourism . 

“Right now, the North Pacific Gyre has moved closer to our island, and that is why we are seeing such a big influx of trash washing up on our beaches,” said Wiedner, speaking about one of five major oceanic gyres on the planet.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the [**North Pacific Gyre**](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/explorations/ex1706/logs/july26/media/gyre.html) — which circulates in a clockwise pattern and covers most of the norther Pacific Ocean — is Earth’s largest ecosystem, encompassing more than 7.7 billion square miles.

It also collects an unusually high amount of human-made marine debris, leading to it often being called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

Wiedner said while the annual July 5th Beach Cleanup is aimed at cleaning up Kaua‘i’s beaches after the 4th of July holiday, it also is meant to educate the community about marine debris and bring awareness to how much harm it causes.

It’s also meant to get community members active in the fight to keep the waters around Kaua’i and its shores — including its beautiful beaches — free of marine debris and rubbish on all fronts.

The invite to Saturday’s beach cleanup says by taking action to protect the environment, “your collection efforts allow Surfrider to use data to influence laws and reduce waste at the source.”

“We want the community to get involved in our efforts,” Wiedner said.

Those unable to attend Saturday’s beach cleanup can sign up to help Surfrider Kaua‘i and Hawai‘i Land Trust during a [**Community Coastal Restoration workday**](https://volunteer.surfrider.org/timeslots/TfC3greVDy) from 8:30 to 10:30 a.m. July 6.

The event Sunday is aimed at preserving Kāhili Beach Preserve — a popular surf spot on the North Shore and located in Ko‘olau — and everyone is invited to come out and help “protect this special place.”

1lqv15m,https://i.redd.it/tcp1kgxfyoaf1.png,A calendar-based expense tracker that makes budgeting actually enjoyable (free to use),"Most budget apps make expense tracking feel like doing taxes. You have to fill out forms, pick from 50+ categories, and navigate through multiple screens just to log a $5 coffee.

I took a different approach - what if expense tracking was as simple as clicking on a calendar?

**How it works:**

* At the start of each month, you activate only the spending categories you'll actually use (dining out, groceries, gas, etc.)
* Your expense grid shows just those categories as columns
* Click any day + category, enter the amount, done
* Visual blocks appear showing your spending patterns

**What makes this different:**

* **Visual spending patterns** \- you instantly see that Tuesday was expensive or that you always overspend on weekends
* **No category overwhelm** \- only 8-12 relevant categories instead of endless lists
* **Context matters** \- seeing expenses in calendar format helps you remember ""oh right, that was when I went to dinner with Sarah""
* **Rapid entry** \- logging 10 expenses takes under a minute

The monthly view shows spending hot spots at a glance. Heavy spending days get bigger visual blocks. You can spot patterns like ""I always blow my budget in the third week"" or ""Fridays are expensive.""

**Example:** June shows I spent $800 on housing (rent), but also $423 on dining out - that visual comparison hits different than seeing separate line items in a list.

1lquzir,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/1lquzir/how_i_try_to_plan_my_week_around_my_budget/,How I try to plan my week around my budget,"I used to feel like I had to choose between saving money and actually enjoying my time here in the US, but I’ve figured out a system that helps me do both without constantly stressing about money.  
  
At the start of each week (usually Sunday), I take 10 minutes to look at what’s coming up classes, plans with friends, errands, whatever and then I mentally map out my spending around that. If I know I’ve got a dinner out or something going on that weekend, I’ll scale back on takeout or other little splurges. Weekly budgeting has worked way better for me than trying to manage things monthly. It’s just easier to course correct. I also use two separate bank cards to keep things organized. I have a local one that I got as soon as I got here that I use for all my day to day stuff here in the US like rent, groceries, online shopping, etc. Then I keep my Visa card from back home as a backup for emergencies or unexpected stuff. That way, I don’t accidentally dip into money I didn’t mean to touch.  
  
I also try to leave space for fun in the budget such as coffee runs, a cheap night out, or just little things that make the week feel less rigid. It’s not about cutting everything, just being a bit more mindful about what actually adds value.  
  
This setup’s made budgeting feel less like a punishment and more like a tool to just keep life steady. Anyone else use something similar? Would love to hear how others make it work and maybe get some ideas.",16,1751562460.0,budget,0,0.94,False

There may be a better place to put this, but this is the sub that I see so many people talking about extensive hygiene/self care routines so many yall can give me some insight to practices or products to help me with my problem. 

I have dry skin, just about everywhere. My scalp, feet, and joints (elbows and knees) being the worst. I drink a moderate amount of water (>32 oz a day), 1 cup of coffee a day, little to none soda or alcohol. I live in an area with very very poor water quality, my skin definitely got worse once I moved to this area but it was an issue prior to living here. I live in a hot and humid climate, if that affects anything other than me sweating as soon as I step outside. I attempt to shower every day, but realistically I probably have ""full routine"" (shampoo, conditioner, antibacterial soap, moisturizing soap) showers every three days with a ""face, butt, feet"" cleaning every day. But that is mostly because of my scalp being the worst of the issue and feel like shampooing more often is adding to the issue. (I have alot of straight, fine hair)

I think my main questions are:
Daily shower people, what are you doing with your scalp?
 All others, do you have moisturizers that you apply that DONT make stepping outside an even more unbearable experience? 
What level of exfoliation do y'all do and how often?

I'm looking for a language exchange partner to improve my spoken Chinese and my reading to a lesser degree.

A bit about my ability as an English speaker, beyond being an ABC:

* I believe my English is better than the vast majority of American English speakers as I have an interest in etymology, idioms, and precise vocabulary 
* I have used English in multiple professional, white collar work environments so I can also speak to how to adjust based on context. I've worked at both startups and large consultancies (feel free to look through my bio)

What I am looking for in an ideal Chinese speaking partner:

* \*Ability to explain how to speak in formal and informal contexts, as I would like to ultimately be able to use some Chinese in a working environment 
* Slight preference for an ""official/proper/northern"" Chinese accent as my accent is from southern china, I often get mistakened for being Taiwanese (not that that's problematic, but I'd like to train myself to speak a bit more ""properly"") 
* Knowledge of some professional terminology, whether it be accounting, or just workplace vocabulary

What an ideal language exchange could look like for me: \*

* I'm based on the Bay area of the US 
* Once a week or biweekly, we could do a 1 hour video call where we spend the first half speaking English and the second half speaking Chinese; each individual to dictate what they want out of their time 
* Between 6pm and 9pm PT would work best for me, that's currently 9am-12pm in China. Open to language partners anywhere in the world though

A bit about me and my interests for context: 

* 30+ year old male, engaged 
* Has two cats, lives in an apartment 
* Hobbies include cooking, wine, traveling for food, pour over coffee, investing/financial independence

## What is InvestKraftPro?

InvestKraftPro is an online trading platform designed primarily for cryptocurrency trading but also supports other asset classes like forex and commodities. Think of it as a **hybrid between a traditional trading platform and an automated trading bot**. It leverages market algorithms to help users make informed decisions or even automate trades, which is great if you don’t want to stare at charts all day.

What sets InvestKraftPro apart from many others is its focus on **user accessibility**. It’s built to welcome both beginners and experienced traders, featuring a clean interface and straightforward setup process. Unlike some platforms that overload you with features you might never use, InvestKraftPro keeps things simple but powerful enough for serious trading.

## Who Created InvestKraftPro?

The creators of InvestKraftPro are a team of seasoned traders and software developers with backgrounds in finance and technology. While you won’t find a flashy celebrity CEO attached, the team’s expertise in algorithmic trading and fintech development is clear in how smoothly the platform operates.

From what I gathered, the developers took inspiration from similar platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge but aimed to improve user experience and security. Their goal was to **democratize access to automated trading tools**, making them less intimidating and more reliable for everyday users.

This means you get up-to-the-minute insights, which is crucial because timing can make or break trades. The analysis covers price trends, volume changes, and even news sentiment, helping you stay ahead of market moves.

Whether you prefer manual trading or using bots, this feature arms you with the info you need to make smarter decisions.

### User-Friendly Interface

Trading platforms can be overwhelming, but ProfittiScia nails the **user interface** by making it clean and intuitive. Even if you’re brand new to trading, you won’t feel lost.

Menus are straightforward, charts are easy to read, and key functions like buying, selling, and setting alerts are just a few clicks away. The platform also offers helpful tooltips and tutorials to get you started.

It’s like having a friendly guide walking you through every step without all the tech jargon.

### Mobile Accessibility

In today’s fast-paced world, being able to trade anytime, anywhere is a must. ProfittiScia’s **mobile apps** for iOS and Android are well-designed, giving you full control on your phone or tablet.

The app supports all major features: managing trades, setting alerts, funding accounts, and even accessing customer support. Push notifications keep you updated on market moves or account activity, so you never miss a beat.

This flexibility is a big plus for traders who don’t want to be glued to their computers.

### Customizable Alerts

ProfittiScia lets you set up **customizable alerts** based on price movements, news events, or trade executions. This means you can tailor notifications to your trading style and risk tolerance.

For example, you can get alerts when Bitcoin hits a certain price or when your stop-loss order executes. This hands-off monitoring saves time and helps you react quickly to market changes.

It’s like having a personal assistant who keeps an eye on your investments even when you’re busy.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Unlike some platforms that focus solely on crypto or forex, ProfittiScia supports **multiple asset classes** including:

- Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)
- Stocks and ETFs
- Forex currency pairs
- Commodities like gold and oil

This diversity lets you diversify your portfolio without hopping between different platforms. Plus, it opens up more trading opportunities across global markets.

## Is ProfittiScia a Scam?

This question is top of mind for many, and honestly, skepticism is healthy in the trading world. After digging into ProfittiScia, the evidence points to it being a **legitimate platform** rather than a scam.

Why? It has:

- Transparent trading processes.
- Positive user reviews and testimonials.
- Regulatory compliance with KYC and AML rules.
- Secure payment and withdrawal methods.
- Responsive customer support.

That said, no trading platform can promise guaranteed profits. The biggest risk is always market volatility and how users manage their trades. Some negative reviews mostly stem from unrealistic expectations or lack of experience.

In short, ProfittiScia is not a scam, but trading always involves risk, so proceed wisely.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on ProfittiScia?

To start trading on ProfittiScia, the **minimum deposit is $250**. This amount is fairly standard for platforms offering real trading with access to multiple asset classes.

While $250 might feel like a bit of a commitment, it’s enough to get meaningful trading experience and potentially see real returns. If you’re just testing the waters, you can use the free demo account first without risking any funds.

Keep in mind that trading with more capital generally allows for better risk management, but only invest what you can afford to lose.

### ProfittiScia Customer Support

A solid customer support team can make or break your trading experience. ProfittiScia offers:

- **24/7 live chat** for instant help.
- Email support for detailed queries.
- Phone support for direct communication.
- Comprehensive FAQ and tutorial resources.

From my experience, their support reps are friendly and knowledgeable. Whether you’re a beginner needing help with account setup or an advanced trader troubleshooting a technical issue, they’re responsive and professional.

Having access to real people whenever you need it is a big plus.

## How do you start trading on ProfittiScia?

Getting started is pretty straightforward. Here’s the step-by-step:

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head over to ProfittiScia’s website and fill out the registration form with your basic info. It’s quick and free. You’ll create a username and password.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Before trading, you’ll need to verify your identity by submitting documents like a passport or driver’s license (this is standard KYC procedure). Once verified, fund your account with at least $250 using options like credit card, bank transfer, or e-wallets.

### Step 3: Start Trading

With funds available, you can explore the platform. Use the demo account to practice or jump right into live trading. Customize alerts, set up automated trading bots, or manually place trades. Monitor your portfolio and adjust as needed.

## How to Delete a ProfittiScia Account?

If you decide ProfittiScia isn’t for you, deleting your account is a simple process:

- Log into your account.
- Navigate to account settings.
- Look for the option to close or delete your account.
- Confirm your decision.

If you have any funds remaining, make sure to withdraw them before deleting. You can also contact customer support if you want assistance with account closure.

1lqutvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToysAndTots/comments/1lqutvf/what_puts_the_mother_in_motherhood/,"What Puts the ""Mother"" in Motherhood","There are moments in motherhood when you're handed lopsided crafts and half-burnt toast on paper plates, and you smile through tears because this is what it means to love with your whole being. You give it all your sleep, your sanity, your body, your time and somehow still feel guilty for needing five minutes to breathe. You hold these bright, boundless little people in your arms, they look up at you with unwavering trust, and you forget for a moment how much it hurt to get here.

Until life bends a little too far, and one day, inevitably, they will blame you. For their sadness. For their scars. For not being able to fix what was never yours to carry. And still, you stay.

Here are nine other things that put the *mother* in motherhood:

**Giving birth.** No poetry here. It’s pain. It’s blood and terror and beauty and strength all tangled into one moment that breaks you and builds you in the same breath. If there’s any justice, someday men will pass a kidney stone the size of a baby’s head.

**Breastfeeding.** They call it bonding. They don’t mention the shooting pain, the cracked skin, the primal ache in your bones as you try to give more of yourself than you have. And still, you keep trying.

**Diapers.** The humility. The smells. The quiet acceptance that this, too, is love, cleaning up the mess without complaint, because that’s what they need.

**Field trips.** A nightmare parade of loud buses and sticky hands. You don’t even like your own kids this much, let alone someone else’s. But you pack the lunch and you go anyway.

**Mothers’ Mornings Out.** A cruel joke. You show up in sweatpants, clinging to lukewarm coffee, praying for connection. Instead, you juggle diaper bags and tantrums under fluorescent lights, pretending it’s relaxing.

**Yard sales.** Selling parts of yourself so you can afford the next size of shoes. Folding old onesies with tears in your eyes, remembering how tiny they used to be. They don’t tell you that grief comes in ziplock bags labeled “3T.”

**Bad movies.** You sit through the same shrill cartoon 27 times, because it makes them laugh. You memorize every line. You fake laugh. And it carves something sacred into your heart.

**No sleep.** They don’t tell you it’s not just the baby years. It’s forever. You lie awake worrying about fevers, bullies, heartbreaks that haven’t happened yet. Your body stays tired. Your love never does.

**Idiocy.** Your toddler defeats you with logic you can’t argue. You once managed a team at work. Now you cry in the pantry because someone taped the dog to the wall and called it ""art.""

Motherhood is hard. Relentless. A slow shedding of who you were before. But inside every scraped knee and midnight vomit and soul-crushing tantrum is something so fierce, so unshakable, you would do it all again tomorrow.

Because these tiny humans, these chaos-makers with your eyes and your laugh and your stubbornness... they hold your heart. Entirely. And no matter how much they break it, it still beats only for them.",1,1751562095.0,ToysAndTots,0,1.0,False

1lqupsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/1lqupsp/af_am_i_overtraining_or_am_i_overthinking/,[af] am I overtraining? Or am I overthinking?,"Greetings all. The title is my question. But let me break it down further. 

I go to the gym 5 times a week. Today was my upper body day and I did the following. 

Lat pull down 12 x 1 (light weight for warm up) then 6-8 x 3 (increasing weight per set.)
Preacher curls on a Smith machine 10-12 x 4 (increasing weight per set.) 
Isolated shoulder lats Smith 8-10 x 3.
Tricep pushdown 10-15 x 4 (increasing weight per set)
Pec Dec machine for chest 8-10 x 4 (increasing weight per set.) 
I take about 30 to 90 seconds break per set. 

Followed by a 30 minute treadmill walk on 13 incline at 3 km/h.

My overall workouts daily is 60 to 90 minutes. So 45 minutes minimum to 60 minutes is weights, then 25 to 30 minutes cardio. 5 times a week. 

I haven't really added weights I know, but that's because I kinda really forget to track the intensity of the set with what weight I have increased to, but, I have increased 
My strength quite a lot. I just need to track that part. 

My workouts start literally first thing in the morning, coffee followed by going to the gym at 4:30. Followed by getting home and getting ready for my work. 

So yes, that's my question. Am I overtraining or overthinking? Thank you for taking the time to read. ",0,1751561839.0,AdvancedFitness,1,0.33,False

1lqumfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrendingReddits/comments/1lqumfg/i_trained_an_ai_on_my_favorite_youtubers_scripts/,I trained an AI on my favorite YouTuber's scripts and it's now writing viral content that gets 500K+ views,"So this is probably going to sound crazy, but I've been obsessed with this YouTuber (Varun Maya) who consistently gets millions of views, and I wanted to figure out what makes his scripts so addictive.

Instead of just studying them, I went full nerd mode and actually scraped 40+ of his video scripts, fed them into Cursor AI, and trained a custom system that now writes in his exact style.

The results are honestly insane:

\- First script I generated: 487K views in 3 days

\- Average engagement rate: 340% higher than my previous content

\- Time to create a script: 15 minutes (used to take me 6+ hours)

**Here's exactly how I did it:**

Step 1: Data Collection

I scraped transcripts from 40+ of his most viral videos and organized them into CSV files. Each script had specific patterns - hooks, pacing, word choice, psychological triggers.

Step 2: Multi-Layer Training

This is where it gets interesting. Instead of just dumping the data, I created 4 different instruction files:

1. Basic writing guide (400+ lines)
2. Psychological analysis framework 
3. Human touch elements (8th grade reading level, short sentences)
4. Hook-specific guide (just for the first 3 seconds)

Step 3: Iterative Prompting

The key was testing each layer separately. I'd generate a script, analyse what was missing, then create another guide to fix those gaps. Did this 4-5 times until the output was indistinguishable from human writing.

**The breakthrough moment:**

I tested it on a random tech story about MIT turning soda cans into hydrogen fuel. Here's what it generated:

*\*""MIT scientists just found a way to turn your empty soda cans into clean hydrogen fuel and it's absolutely wild. They're using recycled aluminium and seawater to produce hydrogen with 87% fewer emissions than traditional methods. But here's where it gets crazy - they discovered that adding coffee grounds makes the reaction 24 times faster...""\**

That script got 500K+ views. The hook was perfect, the pacing felt natural, and people couldn't stop watching.

**What I learned:**

1. Context is everything - Don't just feed raw data. Create instruction layers that teach the AI *\*why\** certain words work
2. Test obsessively - I probably generated 50+ scripts before finding the perfect formula
3. Human elements matter - Adding guidelines for 8th grade language and short sentences made it feel way more natural
4. Hooks are 80% of success - I created a separate 400-line guide just for the first 3 seconds

**The crazy part:**

This works better than any ChatGPT custom model or RAG system I've tried. Cursor's context window is massive, so it actually understands the nuances instead of just copying surface-level patterns.

I'm literally using this system right now to pump out content for multiple channels, and the engagement rates are consistently 3x higher than anything I wrote manually.

**Want to learn?**  
I left all the prompts and guides,videos in the comments below. Fair warning though - this process takes some serious iteration to get right.

Everyone just wants hookups and fun. I envy straight people—they can be themselves anywhere, anytime, and still find romantic love. But for us, it feels like we have to let ourselves be lusted after just to get a chance at connection. We have to let our bodies be used to find something deeper, as if love can only come after proving we’re desirable. It’s exhausting—constantly seeking validation and approval from a society (and even our own community) that judges us first by our looks.  

I know some people will say, “You don’t need others to validate you.” But let’s be real—this is a struggle so many gay people face. Our community sets harsh, unrealistic standards where better bodies get more attention, where lust comes before everything else.  

When will it be our turn to be loved first and lusted after second? When can we just sit in a coffee shop and meet someone without the pressure of performance or lust? When can we exist in the world—doing laundry, grabbing street food, doing groceries—and still feel seen for who we are, not just what we look like? When do we get a space where we don’t have to trade our bodies for affection, where we’re wanted for just who we are, and not on how we perform on bed?

Diary:

Day 1 - Athens

After a 10 hour flight, we land around 11 am Athens time. I’d prearranged a driver ($58), and he’s waiting for us once we get our bags. The drive into Athens is smooth—my partner is exhausted and antisocial, but I am thrilled to be there and answer the drivers questions about the LA riots. I tell him, as mildly as I can, that we disagree with the president’s policies and are excited to see the people rising up.

We are pretty grumpy over lunch. I have a glass of rose that reminds me almost of Lambrusco if it wasn’t sparkling?? And a plate of feta & gruyere saganaki. My partner takes a nap, and I go up to the hotel bar for a glass of wine ($9). I probably last 45 minutes before I go to shower off the 90 degree weather.

I cancel our dinner reservations, because I can tell my partner just isn’t up for it. I join him in napping, then we end up showing up to the hotel rooftop (The Elysium) around 9 for dinner, and it redeems the whole day!!!

We’re indoors, but the ceiling and windows are all open air. The acropolis is front and center, lit up in the darkness. Absolutely magical. I have a Paloma and order tomato orzo with chicken and Corfu salami. We end the night with an espresso martini, and head for a night of trying and failing to fall asleep. ($96)

Food & Drinks: $105

Transit: $58

**Total:** $163

Day 2 - Athens

We wake up, lather on the sunscreen, and head to the Acropolis! The uphill climb is no joke, but the walk is beautiful. We begin counting the local cats we come across (final count of the day was 14). You guys. The acropolis was probably the coolest thing I’ve seen in my entire life. Massive, ancient, and with a 360 degree view of Athens. ($67.60 for 2 tickets)

We wind our way back down, see the Ancient Agora from over the fence, and then walk until our legs can’t carry us anymore and we plop down at the first restaurant we see. I order a ginger lemonade and a veggie omelette. It’s all kinda meh, but it’s nice to rest. ($30.50)

We walk over to the Acropolis Museum ($47 for 2 tickets). My partner is an art history nerd, so he relishes in explaining little details about Ionic columns. The museum was incredibleeee.

My partner goes to nap, and I walk across the street from the hotel to read my book at the In Town Cafe. I order a Freddo cappuccino and tzatziki ($20.13), and spend a marvelous hour and a half solo. My biggest Greek culture shock is how much they leave you alone at restaurants. You kind of have to hunt down the bill when you’re ready for leave.

I return to the hotel for a nap, and we rest until it’s time to walk to dinner. The city comes even more alive in the late evening, and we savor the walk through the bustling city streets. I am soo charmed by Athens, I wish we could eat everywhere. We made a reservation at Sin Athina’s rooftop, and kick off the evening with feta & bread and a bottle of prosecco. I order chicken with eggplant puree. My partner pays. We make our way back to the hotel without a map—it really feels like a small town (kind of like New Orleans?).

Food & Drinks: $50.63

Activities: $107.60

**Total:** $158.23

Day 3 - Athens -> Naxos

We wake up and watch the latest World War 3 updates on CNN. Once we’re thoroughly depressed, we head up to the hotel’s rooftop for a buffet breakfast. I can’t believe we didn’t take advantage of this yesterday—it is gourmet. I have a ham and cheese crepe, a plum, and a mini chocolate croissant.

We quickly pack up and checkout. After the most bizarre taxi ride of my life ($58), we arrive at the Athens airport. It is HOT, but security is pretty quick. I order another Freddo cappuccino, this time with sugar ($5.93). We’re bussed to a propeller plane, and before we know it we’ve landed in Naxos and we’re in another taxi! ($29)

The Naxos Rock Villas are lovely. It looks exactly like the pictures and I immediately change into my bathing suit to unwind after a stressful day of travel. My partner is worn out, so I try to let him be. I do my best to regulate my own mood and avoid resentment.

He rallies, and we open the cheap—but GREEK–wine the hotel left for us. We head down the mountain our suite is situated in, walking a little over a mile in the hot sun. We are testy again at this point, lol. We duck into a supermarket to get some snacks for the house (tzatziki Lays, lol), and then sit down to dinner at Barbounis. After some food we agree that the fight is over. I get chicken souvlaki, a Mythos beer, followed by a generous pour of a local white wine. The restaurant brings us free panna cotta with honey. We’re in good spirits by now, and begin our walk back up the mountain.

When we get back, I’m so hot from climbing the incline that I jump in the pool! Our local cat comes to visit us but gives up on me when she realizes I’m not going to give her any chips. Then it’s time for bed!

Food & Drinks: $5.93, my partner grabbed the rest

Transit: $87

**Total:** $92.93

Day 4 - Naxos

We wake up at 11–neither of us remember the last time we slept 12 hours, but we’re not mad about it. After a leisurely late morning drinking coffee by the pool, we begin our walk to town and head to the beach! We decide to be bougie and set up shop at a restaurant’s sunbeds. We order mojitos, then he gets a club sandwich and I get a Greek salad and a feta pastry. Would ABSOLUTELY recommend—our hotel had the worst internet ever so honestly it was nice to just scroll and drink good cocktails. When we go to pay the bill, they give us free ice cream bars “for a sweet marriage”. (The total is $62. The sunbeds were allegedly 20 euro each but they must have discounted us because this bill feels impossibly low). Golden Beach in Agios Prokopios!

We walk back to our place and I hop in the pool while my partner naps. We get all dressed up, because why not?! A taxi takes us into Naxos Town around 8:00. (20 euros, he pays) We get there just in time for sunset and grab the first table at The Locals that we see that has a perfect view. I order tapas — various spreads on bread— and my partner gets a salad. I drink an incredible glass of wine and spend way too long trying to get the waitress’s attention for the bill ($69). Our next stop is Taverna for another drink, before we call it a night and head back to the hotel (another 20 euros from my lovely husband). Our local cat is waiting for us, so I hang out with her while my partner gets ready for bed. 

Food & Drinks: $131

Transit: free for meeee

**Total:** $131

Day 5 - Naxos

We spend the day relaxing by our pool. Around 2:15, we get a taxi into Naxos Town. We have cocktails & beers at AVATON 1739, and it’s the perfect spot to sit with books and just chill. It’s a rooftop & the view is gorgeous - definitely worth it! ($58)

We explore a little, enjoying the winding roads that are so representative of how Americans picture Greece. After a while we settle in at 520 (a recommendation I got from Reddit). I think this was my favorite stop of the whole trip—I ordered a gin & mezcal cocktail which sounds like a freaky combo but it was SO GOOOOOD. We sat there forever, reading and enjoying the stunning view of the ships on the water. ($29) I wish we’d called it quits here, because we got overtired and ruined the night for ourselves, lol.

We did some more exploring, and then got a coffee at Fine August. Both of my Reddit recs were fully booked for dinner, so we ended up back at Taverna. We sat in the garden this time, which was way more beautiful but absolutely packed. As a result, the service was slooooow. I was glad to finally get out of there and get home.

Food & Drinks: $87

My husband paid for taxis & dinner today.

**Total:** $87

Day 6 - Naxos

We have a lazy morning in, then walk to Agios Prokopios to grab lunch at La Trattoria ($37.75). I order the fried feta - my dear husband has no interest, so I have no choice but to consume an entire block of feta. Obviously. My biggest regret of the trip so far is not venturing to the inland cities, so my partner suggests we rent an ATV to explore the island. I’m not a 4 wheeler type person, and it takes some convincing. But the rental place has helmets and the bike looks solid enough, and soon enough we’re off! He paid $50 for the rental, plus a little more for gas.

We had a paper map, but mostly just took turns deciding which direction to turn. We followed signs to obscure destinations, like a really old church in the middle of nowhere. We explored the abandoned, unfinished hotel at Alyko Beach, and then went up to Chalki and Filoti just so I could lay eyes on them. When the sun started going down, we headed back to Agios Prokopios. This adventure was the highlight of our trip and I’m so glad we did it! We grabbed tzatziki, crackers, and beer at the supermarket for a makeshift dinner ($17) and trekked back up to our suite for the night.

Food & Drinks: $54.75

**Total:** $54.75

Day 7 - Naxos -> Santorini

We check out around 11 am and head to the port ($35). We’re a little nervous for the ferry based on what we’ve read online. We picked the biggest boat we could (a big Blue Star) to limit rocking–the last thing we wanted was to be seasick. The process was actually very well run! We’re shepherded into a massive line at the port, and then once we make it on board we just leave our suitcases (weird feeling) and go upstairs. We grab a comfy spot at the cafe–maybe because it’s a Tuesday, but there’s plenty of open seating–and settle in for 2 hours of eating pringles and reading.

Our hotel sends a driver to pick us up in Santorini. The drive up from the port is insanely curvy and never-ending. Keep that in mind if you have a sensitive stomach! Once we make it to the hotel, an employee hoists up my 45 pound suitcase on his shoulder and grabs my partner’s with his other hand. He expertly climbs the ten million stairs and drops them off at our room. My husband gives him a nice tip because holy shit.

Our room is the Petra Superior Suite at the Petra Honeymoon Suites in Imerovigli. It is absolutely stunning. Probably the prettiest place I’ve been in my entire life. They left us a bottle of wine, so I have a glass on the porch while my partner naps. Then we head up to the hotel pool for dinner! It’s the most romantic setting ever - it’s basically pitch black except for the bright lights in Fira and Oia, there’s soft jazz playing…a dream. ($120)

Food & Drinks: $120

Transit: $35

**Total:** $155


Day 8 - Santorini

We have some fruit in our hotel room for breakfast, and then embark on the walking path to Fira. The steps up from our hotel room to the path are a workout enough! We’re well prepared with workout clothes, hats, & sunscreen. We pass so many women in dramatic blue dresses and heels and I just don’t know how they did it, hahaha. We stop at Da Costa for lunch. Would recommend! The waiter is lovely and the greek salad hits the spot.

We grab a postcard for our nephews and then head back to the hotel. We read on the patio for a while, shower, and then catch the beginning of the sunset at the pool before walking up to the Aegean Restaurant for dinner. The sun is out of view from where we’re sitting, but the sky is incredible and it’s a great spot for people watching. I get such a kick out of watching people stop for pictures, as if I’m a superior tourist. I order zucchini risotto and it’s incredible. We get a drink at the hotel bar (can you tell we are exhausted at this point of the trip and not interested in venturing beyond the hotel? hahaha) and admire our view–we can make out Skaros Rock in the darkness ($30ish). Then it’s time for more reading & wine on the patio before bed!

Drinks: $30

**Total:** $30

Day 9 - Santorini

I wake up a little disgruntled that we haven’t done Santorini justice. We just aren’t in the mood for hordes of tourists–we’ve agreed to scrap Oia from our itinerary entirely. My husband sleeps in and I go to the breakfast buffet. It is a FEAST, and I make friends with the staff who I think can’t comprehend that my partner is skipping breakfast. They bring me juice, water, and coffee to supplement my leek pastry, egg scramble, chocolate croissant, kiwi….omg. I take in the incredible views and savor my coffee.

When I get back to the room, my husband just wants me to be happy, and he’ll go along with whatever I want to do today. I decide that’s a wine tasting! We book the “Santorini Roots” experience at Artemis Karamolegos ($99). We decide to uber (I wish we’d asked our hotel to book us a taxi. It’s quite a walk to a car-accessible street, and our data roaming wasn’t working so I had to run around trying to get enough internet to call the car, lol). The wine tasting is the highlight of Santorini! All of the wines are delicious, the setting is beautiful, and it feels honeymoon-ly. My husband isn’t a drinker, so it’s special for him to be willing to drink wine for me. He gets us some fries (the Greeks do potatoes far superior to Americans, let me tell you) and an extra glass of wine to extend the adventure.

When we get back to the hotel, we pack up our suitcases in preparation for our early wakeup call the next morning. You know the drill–rest/shower/read on the patio for a while! Then we go up to the hotel restaurant for sunset. Oh my GOD it takes them an hour to take our food order. At this point the kitchen is closing in like 15 minutes and we’re starving, lol. They bring me a half-cold moussaka that was clearly being baked from frozen–it’s like $40 for this mediocre dish but at this point I’m so ready to go back to the room that I don’t even care. ($91). We hike up to the reception area (hike is not an exaggeration!) and check out, since reception won’t be open when we’re ready to leave the next morning.

Food & Drinks: $91

Activities: $99

Transit: $102 (for 2 ubers, yikes)

**Total:** $292

Day 10 - Homeward bound

UGHH our travel story home is so depressing I don’t even want to write it. TLDR, we had a tight connection to make it back to Chicago, and our flight from Santorini was slightly delayed. We had plenty of time to make the flight, but missed the baggage check deadline and were turned away. We ended up booking a flight to London, had a 9 hr layover, and then flew to Chicago. It was awful. But we do great with a common enemy, so we made the best of it. Even befriended some random middle aged Australians, which is out of character for us.

I have more cash savings, so I shouldered the unexpected flight cost ($1,666) while he got the hotel ($250). From here on out, we’ll be merging finances, so really it’s “our” money now anyway. What a way to end the vacation! We feel really lucky to be in a financial position where this is an upsetting inconvenience and not something that prevents us from making our rent next month.

Food & Drinks: $40 in airport food

Flights: $1.7k

**Total:** $1.74k

Trip reflection:
I don’t have the exact breakdown of my partner’s expenses, **in total we spent $12,000**. To afford the trip, I started socking away money monthly in 2023! We put honeymoon activities on our wedding registry (wine tasting, seaside dinners, etc), but ended up putting that money towards our down payment instead.

Greece is so beautiful, the food is amazing, and there is just so much to experience. This was our first time taking this big of a trip just the two of us, and I think we learned a lot about each other. I prefer to squeeze a lot in, and he likes to rest. We both compromised, and now I know I love Greece and can return to fulfil the rest of my bucket list!

I have recently decided to start planning a solo wild camping trip for the end of August, just before the start of uni. The plan is a 2 day hitchhike to Glasgow from London. Then a 4 day hike around Loch Lomond. After which, 2 days of hitchhiking back to London. 

I am not new to camping, as I used to do it at least once a year with my parents from a very young age. So I believe I am well prepared, but I would still like to ask -

**What is something I don't know that I don't know?**

**What is something that I should pay a lot of attention to when doing such a trip?**

1lquceo,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiagents/comments/1lquceo/i_trained_an_ai_on_my_favorite_youtubers_scripts/,I trained an AI on my favorite YouTuber's scripts and it's now writing viral content that gets 500K+ views,"So this is probably going to sound crazy, but I've been obsessed with this YouTuber (Varun Maya) who consistently gets millions of views, and I wanted to figure out what makes his scripts so addictive.

Instead of just studying them, I went full nerd mode and actually scraped 40+ of his video scripts, fed them into Cursor AI, and trained a custom system that now writes in his exact style.

The results are honestly insane:

\- First script I generated: 487K views in 3 days

\- Average engagement rate: 340% higher than my previous content

\- Time to create a script: 15 minutes (used to take me 6+ hours)

**Here's exactly how I did it:**

Step 1: Data Collection

I scraped transcripts from 40+ of his most viral videos and organized them into CSV files. Each script had specific patterns - hooks, pacing, word choice, psychological triggers.

Step 2: Multi-Layer Training

This is where it gets interesting. Instead of just dumping the data, I created 4 different instruction files:

1. Basic writing guide (400+ lines)
2. Psychological analysis framework 
3. Human touch elements (8th grade reading level, short sentences)
4. Hook-specific guide (just for the first 3 seconds)

Step 3: Iterative Prompting

The key was testing each layer separately. I'd generate a script, analyse what was missing, then create another guide to fix those gaps. Did this 4-5 times until the output was indistinguishable from human writing.

**The breakthrough moment:**

I tested it on a random tech story about MIT turning soda cans into hydrogen fuel. Here's what it generated:

*\*""MIT scientists just found a way to turn your empty soda cans into clean hydrogen fuel and it's absolutely wild. They're using recycled aluminium and seawater to produce hydrogen with 87% fewer emissions than traditional methods. But here's where it gets crazy - they discovered that adding coffee grounds makes the reaction 24 times faster...""\**

That script got 500K+ views. The hook was perfect, the pacing felt natural, and people couldn't stop watching.

**What I learned:**

1. Context is everything - Don't just feed raw data. Create instruction layers that teach the AI *\*why\** certain words work
2. Test obsessively - I probably generated 50+ scripts before finding the perfect formula
3. Human elements matter - Adding guidelines for 8th grade language and short sentences made it feel way more natural
4. Hooks are 80% of success - I created a separate 400-line guide just for the first 3 seconds

**The crazy part:**

This works better than any ChatGPT custom model or RAG system I've tried. Cursor's context window is massive, so it actually understands the nuances instead of just copying surface-level patterns.

I'm literally using this system right now to pump out content for multiple channels, and the engagement rates are consistently 3x higher than anything I wrote manually.

**Want to learn?**  
I left all the prompts and guides,videos in the comments below. Fair warning though - this process takes some serious iteration to get right.

It’s only been about 10 days. The GERD is significantly better, reflecting that it was likely largely the product of my eating and drinking habits. I’m also intermittent fasting per the doc’s recommendation (which I’ve done before and liked hearing, to be honest). 

Even at 1-2 per night after work, that was obviously too much; the consensus is now rightly that any amount is bad. 

My question — in your experience, are the following sometimes contradictory side effects common to refraining of what was probably excessive alcohol consumption?. 

1. General unease and discomfort (more mental than physical)
2. Lack of focus
3. Depression/down mood 
4. Lack of productivity

1lqu7oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/florianopolis/comments/1lqu7oo/places_to_work_from_in_floripa/,places to work from in floripa,"None of the reddit posts or blogs online are hitting for me, if you're looking for cool places to work from with reliable wifi, chill scene, more or less good music/ambient, and good coffee/beverages/snacks, here's a comprehensive list of places to check out in Floripa.

**Lagoa de Conceição:**

* **Cultura Cafe** \- Yes, it's on every list, and while it may be the starbucks of Floripa, it's also the starbucks of... well.. FLORIPA. So, swallow the elitism- the staff is so friendly here, it's got no frills food and coffees, plenty of space to work from and outlets galore! (also treat yourself to the mac n cheese com linguica here lol).
* **\*Messkla -** my favorite coffee shop hidden here. The natural light, the occasional man playing piano (and maybe even singing coldplay songs) and being able to walk to the Lagoa nearby makes this place such a vibe. (Get the jam cheese toast with bacon here)
* **Sunrise Cafe-** this is a bit busier but makes for a nice evening work session with a solid pasta and wine selection. Think- you're hungry, ravenous even, passionate and need to wrap up your work day strong.
* **Floripão -** casual and quick vibes, gets busy but great if you're in the mood for a light bite, too.

***Around the Lagoa***

* **\*Cafe Decor** \- V*ery* cozy cafe to work from. Multiple seating options here, too- my favorite is outdoors, you are cocooned in greenery here and right across the street from the Lagoa if you want to stretch your legs, too!
* **Cafe Pacai** \- Sweet and friendly staff here and beautiful day to spend the entire day working from. Glass windows through looking out towards the Lagoa, which makes for such a nice sunset, too. It does get busy later in the day though!
* **Coquille Sabor e Café** \- This is more of a catch up with your friends spot, but if you want to explore a new place with an excellent view from higher up or right before or after a day at the beach (Praia Mole), great place to work from, too.

**Rio Tavares/Campeche**

* **Manao Bowls -** Vegan cafe with amazing smoothie/acai bowls (Cacau bowl is my fave) and incredible cozy beverages (coffee is alright, gets the job done) - quiet place to work from, especially if you want to enjoy the sun.
* **Anomada** \- Incredible brunch place with great coffee- a bit busier with sometimes funky hours, but if it's open and you're in the area- perfect place to work from. Take home some bread, too.
* **\*Cumbuca -** One of the most beautiful and yummy restaurants in the area IMO. You have to visit for breakfast *and/or* lunch (NOT A BRUNCH PLACE because they have very weird hours lol, so go prepared to not really have options from 11:30-12:30 lol). It operates mostly as a restaurant so don't feel weird if you have your laptop out, it's still fantastic- just be a good customer and not just a seat-warmer.
* **O Pão de Cada Dia-** Great place to grab a simple pastry/snack or reading corner. I'm sorry but... i hate their coffee lol but they have PLENTY of other drinks and yummy bites! While it has lot's of natural light and outdoor seasoning, it's also quite cozy for a rainy day.
* **Armazém Grão Mestre** \- Go hungry, probably my favorite buffet/por quilo spot in the area. Rich, organic, and colorful meal, great doces and cafe tambem! Only open around lunch hours though- so make this a working lunch spot! (Also an organic loja.)
* **\*Sehat** \- This is a cafe by day, happy hour by happy hour, Thai restaurant by night. Great business model imo lol. Lots of seating spaced apart nicely, flooded with natural light and great selection of coffees and beverages to sip on throughout the work day!
* **\*Om Coffee** \- oh this place is so cute and cozy. I went on a rainy, cold day and it just made everything a little cinematic. <3 It's also a yoga and spa spot but I haven't tried those! Also a good place to catch up with a friend or have a coffee date!
* **O Infiltrado** \- My favorite coffee in Floripa, it is small with a couple communal tables and *outdoors* so go on a warm day! I used to do my laundry across the street and work from there.
* **Fermenteria -** Actually a bakery but a nice spot to start the day, you can journal and read from here too, and for some reason it never shows up on maps, but you can absolutely spend the day working from here.

***Places I didn't checkout but would love to next time:***

* Paradiso Mercato e Caffe
* Uma Origem

1lqu72d,https://i.redd.it/ruvgoocjroaf1.png,Electrical quote check - 400 amp service (2-200  amp panels),"First time building a home for our family with room for grandparents in a separate area. The electricians are known to do quality work on custom homes in our area. However, our budget was originally slated for around $60k and this is much more. Granted since we were originally quoted for the construction loan, the HVAC setup became more complicated with 3ct. 4 ton units vs. 2. (Reason being that we have some metal/solid wood ceiling supports that we can't go through so HVAC team decided to add 1 more unit for that part of the home.) We've also added 2 outdoor infrared heaters, additional led tape lighting, pool prewire and outlet for a motorized screen.   
  
Would that necessitate a $20k jump in electrical? Or is there something here that we could add later...(i.e. car chargers...we don't have any electrical cars)

So there's a woman who lives in my neighborhood who I've seen around at the coffee shops I go to. We've made eye contact, she's fairly pretty, but we've never spoken. I haven't seen her around for a few weeks but this week I saw she's viewed my LinkedIn profile a couple times. I don't know how she would have found it, we have no mutual connections, but now I know her name.

I don't know if I should message her, or if that's weird. But she did look me up... Is that weird or does it mean that she's interested in me?

1lqu543,https://www.reddit.com/r/n8n_ai_agents/comments/1lqu543/i_trained_an_ai_on_my_favorite_youtubers_scripts/,I trained an AI on my favorite YouTuber's scripts and it's now writing viral content that gets 500K+ views,"So this is probably going to sound crazy, but I've been obsessed with this YouTuber (Varun Maya) who consistently gets millions of views, and I wanted to figure out what makes his scripts so addictive.

Instead of just studying them, I went full nerd mode and actually scraped 40+ of his video scripts, fed them into Cursor AI, and trained a custom system that now writes in his exact style.

The results are honestly insane:

\- First script I generated: 487K views in 3 days

\- Average engagement rate: 340% higher than my previous content

\- Time to create a script: 15 minutes (used to take me 6+ hours)

**Here's exactly how I did it:**

Step 1: Data Collection

I scraped transcripts from 40+ of his most viral videos and organized them into CSV files. Each script had specific patterns - hooks, pacing, word choice, psychological triggers.

Step 2: Multi-Layer Training

This is where it gets interesting. Instead of just dumping the data, I created 4 different instruction files:

1. Basic writing guide (400+ lines)
2. Psychological analysis framework 
3. Human touch elements (8th grade reading level, short sentences)
4. Hook-specific guide (just for the first 3 seconds)

Step 3: Iterative Prompting

The key was testing each layer separately. I'd generate a script, analyse what was missing, then create another guide to fix those gaps. Did this 4-5 times until the output was indistinguishable from human writing.

**The breakthrough moment:**

I tested it on a random tech story about MIT turning soda cans into hydrogen fuel. Here's what it generated:

*\*""MIT scientists just found a way to turn your empty soda cans into clean hydrogen fuel and it's absolutely wild. They're using recycled aluminium and seawater to produce hydrogen with 87% fewer emissions than traditional methods. But here's where it gets crazy - they discovered that adding coffee grounds makes the reaction 24 times faster...""\**

That script got 500K+ views. The hook was perfect, the pacing felt natural, and people couldn't stop watching.

**What I learned:**

1. Context is everything - Don't just feed raw data. Create instruction layers that teach the AI *\*why\** certain words work
2. Test obsessively - I probably generated 50+ scripts before finding the perfect formula
3. Human elements matter - Adding guidelines for 8th grade language and short sentences made it feel way more natural
4. Hooks are 80% of success - I created a separate 400-line guide just for the first 3 seconds

**The crazy part:**

This works better than any ChatGPT custom model or RAG system I've tried. Cursor's context window is massive, so it actually understands the nuances instead of just copying surface-level patterns.

I'm literally using this system right now to pump out content for multiple channels, and the engagement rates are consistently 3x higher than anything I wrote manually.

I left all the prompts and guides,videos in the comments below. Fair warning though - this process takes some serious iteration to get right.

1lqu49u,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1lqu49u/manifesting_is_easy/,Manifesting is easy,"This sub has become a pit full of people who over complicate the entire process, and the reason for this is the oversaturated youtube videos and tiktoks that teach a “new technique” every other day. People can’t manifest because they put their faith into a new method everyday. “Oh this didn’t work as quick as I wanted so I’m going to try something new”. You’ll be stuck in a rut and begin to hate manifesting if you do down that route. The law of assumption, law of attraction, manifesting - whatever you call it, it’s the same thing and uses the same ideology. And most importantly it’s always happening - you cannot switch off from manifesting. 

There are plenty people I see who believe in the 3D/4D nonsense, do scripting, do robotic affirmations, make vision boards, even write letters to themselves, and yet they still don’t have their manifestation. I see people take longer than 3 months to manifest an SP. They over complicate the entire process. 

MANIFESTATION IS INSTANT. 

The moment you make an assumption, it happens. 
It doesn’t matter if doubts come, you need to have full conviction. You don’t need to manifest waking up in the morning, you don’t need to manifest your furniture in your house being there when you wake up, you don’t manifest the people in your life being there every day. The moment you attach yourself to a manifestation, you detach from the possibility of having it. If you had your SP, you wouldn’t be doing affirmations or scripting, or being like a looney person and saying “okay I have my SP in the 4D but in the 3D they’re getting it on with the 3P but that’s fine because I’m manifesting and in a few months they’ll be mine”. It doesn’t make sense. You either have your desire in this world or you don’t have it at all, and the only person who has that decision to make is you. You aren’t God, but God has given you the ability to manifest things. I see lots of people claiming they’re gods and yet they struggle to manifest, you need to destroy that ego because that is the ultimate limiting belief. 

The big issue:

The only issue you’ll ever deal with in manifesting is your own limiting beliefs. That’s it. If you believe being obese runs in your family so you can’t lose weight, guess what? You’re going to identify with that belief. If you believe a medical condition runs in your family, you’re going to identify with that belief. And the phony manifestation methods I mentioned above like believing you have your desire in the 4D and not the 3D, scripting, robotic affirmations - are all your own limiting beliefs. “If I just write my desire out 1000 times I’ll get it”. “If I just affirm everyday I’ll get my desire”. Nobody ever said you have to do a long process to get your desire, you created that own assumption in your mind and yet once you do all those methods, you still don’t get your desire. The law of assumption doesn’t say “do this and do that so you’ll get what you want”. It only says make an assumption, and have full conviction. That’s it. 

“You are in Barbados” - Neville Goddard. This quote is everything you’ll ever need in manifesting. You don’t need the money hungry YouTubers who make you watch every video they post and you still left confused. You don’t need to watch endless tiktoks. You manifest every single day effortlessly and you don’t think about it because you don’t have limiting beliefs when it comes to those things. This is why people always suggest starting off with manifesting a coffee, there’s no emotion in it. 

My advice to anyone who is struggling is to focus on your own happiness. Get rid of your limiting beliefs even if that means getting rid of anything or anyone negative in your life. Life is meant to be enjoyed, you have the ability to manifest so don’t over complicate this gift. Just make the assumption and stick to it. ",19,1751560412.0,lawofassumption,6,0.86,False

I have a pretty terrible past in romantic relationships, however my husband and I have seemed to make it work so far, especially after our kid was born. I love my husband and respect him, but because of whatever flaws, i tend to be unhappy or restrained in my marriage(guilt, mostly). We have tried couples therapy but it hasn’t worked the way i wanted to (i suggested separation and coparenting while husband wasn’t sure), and it doesn’t seem like my husband wants to try and REALLY make changes whatsoever. hes happy living in his bubble as long as i take care of the kid, dont get involved with other men and keep having sex with him until he comes. At this point i feel like my sex drive has gone to crap because of lack of intimacy but whatever, i’m over it. i have responsibilities as a mom and as a wife and im happy i get to fulfill them.

Through therapy, ive found that due to my not-so-positive relationship with my father, ive had a tendency to seriously emotionally attach myself to my romantic partners and the ones who were older to me, i felt a sense of them being a mentor figure to me. In a way, i always wanted to make them proud by achieving my ambitions. 

Most of my exes are taken and i respect that. in fact, we follow each other on social media and nothing inappropriate has ever happend with them. Virtually or otherwise.

Should i mention to my husband that I would like to meet them for a coffee when i visit my hometown? Provided, they wanna meet me too ofc. i would just like to get my husband’s permission first. i’d be okay if either of our partners came along too. i don’t have any sexual feelings towards my exes, it’s more like reminiscing a friendship/mentorship.

🩶 Tips for Swapping Successfully

☕ Choose lower-calorie coffee options: black coffee, Americano, or a latte with skimmed milk and sugar-free syrup.  
💧 Carry a reusable water bottle and flavour with cucumber, mint, or berries for variety.  
🍹 When socialising, opt for diet mixers with spirits, alcohol-free options, or sparkling water with lime.  
🧃 Be mindful of “healthy” drinks like smoothies and juices, which can be calorie-dense and spike blood sugar.  
🫖 Herbal and fruit teas are a comforting, calorie-free option in colder weather.

💚 A Gentle Reminder

Swapping drinks is not about restriction but about choosing options that align with your goals while still enjoying what you consume. You can still enjoy your favourite drinks occasionally while making lower-calorie swaps a default in your day-to-day routine.

Small, consistent swaps = big changes over time.

1lqu1mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/n8n_on_server/comments/1lqu1mw/i_trained_an_ai_on_my_favorite_youtubers_scripts/,I trained an AI on my favorite YouTuber's scripts and it's now writing viral content that gets 500K+ views,"So this is probably going to sound crazy, but I've been obsessed with this YouTuber (Varun Maya) who consistently gets millions of views, and I wanted to figure out what makes his scripts so addictive.



Instead of just studying them, I went full nerd mode and actually scraped 40+ of his video scripts, fed them into Cursor AI, and trained a custom system that now writes in his exact style.



The results are honestly insane:

\- First script I generated: 487K views in 3 days

\- Average engagement rate: 340% higher than my previous content

\- Time to create a script: 15 minutes (used to take me 6+ hours)



 **Here's exactly how I did it:**



Step 1: Data Collection

I scraped transcripts from 40+ of his most viral videos and organized them into CSV files. Each script had specific patterns - hooks, pacing, word choice, psychological triggers.



Step 2: Multi-Layer Training

This is where it gets interesting. Instead of just dumping the data, I created 4 different instruction files:

1. Basic writing guide (400+ lines)

2. Psychological analysis framework 

3. Human touch elements (8th grade reading level, short sentences)

4. Hook-specific guide (just for the first 3 seconds)



Step 3: Iterative Prompting

The key was testing each layer separately. I'd generate a script, analyse what was missing, then create another guide to fix those gaps. Did this 4-5 times until the output was indistinguishable from human writing.



 **The breakthrough moment:**



I tested it on a random tech story about MIT turning soda cans into hydrogen fuel. Here's what it generated:



*\*""MIT scientists just found a way to turn your empty soda cans into clean hydrogen fuel and it's absolutely wild. They're using recycled aluminium and seawater to produce hydrogen with 87% fewer emissions than traditional methods. But here's where it gets crazy - they discovered that adding coffee grounds makes the reaction 24 times faster...""\**



That script got 500K+ views. The hook was perfect, the pacing felt natural, and people couldn't stop watching.



 **What I learned:**



1. Context is everything - Don't just feed raw data. Create instruction layers that teach the AI *\*why\** certain words work

2. Test obsessively - I probably generated 50+ scripts before finding the perfect formula

3. Human elements matter - Adding guidelines for 8th grade language and short sentences made it feel way more natural

4. Hooks are 80% of success - I created a separate 400-line guide just for the first 3 seconds



 **The crazy part:**



This works better than any ChatGPT custom model or RAG system I've tried. Cursor's context window is massive, so it actually understands the nuances instead of just copying surface-level patterns.



I'm literally using this system right now to pump out content for multiple channels, and the engagement rates are consistently 3x higher than anything I wrote manually.



**Want to learn?**    
I left all the prompts and guides,videos in the comments  below. Fair warning though - this process takes some serious iteration to get right.



Has anyone else tried training AI on specific creators? I'm curious if this works across different niches or if I just got lucky with the tech/science space.",6,1751560234.0,n8n_on_server,1,0.81,False
1lqu0fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LightPhone/comments/1lqu0fd/directions_tool_love_and_improvements/,Directions Tool: Love and Improvements,"To preface, my experience with the Light Phone III has been stellar! Yes, there have been a few hiccups with the software, but that's how these things go. Nobody pumps out perfect code first time around.

I've been really focusing in the directions tool as this is what I use to around in the city. So here's been my experience with the LPIII Directions tool with some things I love and some things that could use improvement:

# My Experience with the Directions Tool

The Directions tool is an extremely straight forward, easy to use navigation guidance system. I've had little problems when navigating through and around my city. I'm not sure if the folks at Light Phone are the ones that control the directions tool itself, but here are my opinions.

**Things I Love with Things that could be improved:**

*Ease of use:* The simplicity of inputting where you want to go is super easy. The GPS signal locks on very quickly--much faster than the LPII--and when I'm about to drive somewhere, I no longer have to rely on offline mode to hopefully get me there by reading step-by-step instructions. And typically with the LPII, I had to carry around my iPhone just incase i didn't get a GPS lock signal.

*Driving Direction:* Okay, so the driving directions definitely have a huge leg up on the LPII. There's very little to no lag while using. There are a few caveats:

* Exits are a nightmare. The exit number isn't given to you until you need to exit. So, if you're unfamiliar with a city/area, good luck. I'd love to see the exit number displayed and not merely the street name/route number.
* Re-routing takes forever. Navigation assumes I can pick up my car at any point and turn 180 degrees to the right direction. We've all missed turns and exits before, so having a quick turnaround on when a new route is forced in the direction you are going would be extremely helpful.
* Voice guidance is okay. A feature where the voice says, ""go past this light and at the next one turn left on to Street Name."" Something along those lines prevents me from even looking over at my phone when driving.
* Multiple Route selection doesn't exist. As soon as you press the map button to get you there, you're going on that predetermined route. A few choices and previewed on the map could be helpful.
* Multiple Stops. This one may be a long shot, but being able to put in multiple stops would be graet too.

*Location of Businesses*: This has been fairly accurate, however there have been a handful of cases where I'd put in the location of a business I'm visiting and it takes me to a (somewhat) wrong location. For example, going to business A at 123 Street Name and end a few blocks north or south to that address. Luckily, since I know the city decently well I'll sometimes catch this ahead of time, but there have been a few instances where I haven't been to a certain place and have use the Directory Tool to find the actual address. Or I'll search up wherever I need to go beforehand on my computer to ensure I'm going to the right address. Which brings me to my next point...

*Integration with Directory Tool:* I love using the Directory tool as I've found it to be very accurate in terms of what is around my default location. However, I have found a few quirks with this integration. If, again, I'm going to business A at 123 Street Name, the directory tool will actually have the correct address, but when I click on the Map icon in the bottom right corner, it'll bring me to the Directions tool with the wrong address. Again, not very helpful if both the Directions and Directory tools indicate different addresses. Some continuity between the two would be great.

* *Quick Note about the Directory Tool: If there was a way to use the GPS signal instead of a default location to perform a search would elevate this tool to another level. I was recently traveling in another city and had an annoying time trying to find breakfast/coffee in the area since it kept defaulting to the location in my home city.*

*Public Transit*: Using the public transit feature is great...if you know the city. Routes typically just show the bus and will only show 3 routes to select from. On top of that, there is no way to preview each route before selecting it. Sure you can select each route one by one to see what area's it may take you, but I think being able to see each route on a map would be nice.

* There is also no way to select your preferred mode of public transit. Some areas I prefer the bus, while others, the train may get me there faster. But overall, I think having the ability to see more than 3 routes would be fantastic.
* Regardless, if I plan on taking the train, I need to bring my iPhone with me just to purchase tickets on their app. So maybe this isn't as essential in my city as compared to others. I could use cash, but alas, in this overly digital world, I very rarely carry cash.

Another smallish feature that could be helpful is the ability to select the map and move around to see what's in the surrounding area.

I'm sure there is more, but these are the big ones. I hope that the team from Light Phone continues to improve the--albeit few--tools it has to offer and continues to polish them up to the best of their abilities. I get that it takes a lot of time, effort, and money to improve these tools. And not every request heard needs to be made, since at the end of the day, we make do with what we have.",7,1751560155.0,LightPhone,3,0.9,False

I'm looking to make more friends that are open to texting or chatting throughout the day. Been having some anxiety lately and meeting new people excites me. I work in IT so I'm generally around my phone often. I enjoy small chit chats, but I do like to get to know people. We're all on this crazy adventure of life trying to achieve things, go with the flow, or even sit around and do nothing - so let's share! Prefer long term friends, but always here for those who want to chat/vent/or just need a listening ear - I am told I'm very encouraging and patient. If you're local - that would be cool to meet up for coffee or hobbies, but not a deal breaker. 

About me: 
Married with a toddler daughter (You're a parent as well? Oh, could use someone to connect with) - Partner is a stay at home mom. Our relationship is well. We do our own things throughout the day but sometimes we'll do something together. Not looking to change any situation for anyone. 

Huge video gamer and just got back into streaming. I often play solo horror indie games at night - I'm generally on my PC at the end of the day winding down with music, gaming, sometimes a movie. If you're into gaming co op games (don't do a lot of comp FPS, but i do dabble in CS/Marvels/OW2 but not as much as I used to - open to most games) - then we would probably have more in common. Use discord often so if you use that, messaging is easier. 

I do a podcast called ""Moteavation Station"" with a friend. In a way, it's my own version of therapy. We try to talk about our lives as well as meeting people who share their life stories. I enjoy hearing what drives people and makes them happy. Can tell you more about it but it's been helping me stay encouraged for myself - something I think i lost doing but I'm finding myself again.

I enjoy talking about anything really - i love learning new things and asking a billion questions to share your excitement on something as well as adding it to my life experiences. 

Been going through some trials in life, with work and family - I don't like to open up as often since I've been burned - I always just kind of put on a brave face and take the day. Be patient with me but if we do grow close, I may open up more. I've lost a number of close friends, so would like to find someone to grow with. I generally text back quick and often, but that doesn't mean you have to. 



I hope to meet some cool people to talk with, game with, or even meet.  Hope everyone is doing well! Be safe and enjoy your holiday weekend!",1,1751560131.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False

How do I navigate this?,"Hey guys, I (M/24 Arab) am in shock and could use some outside perspective. For starters, I had been everything this girl could have dreamed of. In my nature, romance, very nice dates and gold jewelry from day one. In the time I’ve been with her, I never let her pay for anything, I’ve spoiled her in every way possible, and bought her a phone, a very nice car, and everything she could want. I truly treated her as a princess, talked to her with utmost respect and admiration, and I’ve been 100% loyal to her. 

My girlfriend (F/20 Latina) cheated and lied multiple times (which I just found out about this past Sunday evening). I met her at a restaurant yesterday to talk and didn’t get anywhere other than confirming my conclusion. I love her immensely, but I want to end things. Here’s the story. Sorry for the long read.

Last Saturday, my girlfriend went to a party. We’d agreed no guys at parties, as loyalty is everything to me. That same nigh I stayed up working until she got back to her home to make sure she’s safe. Sunday, we had a great day, swimming, took her to get her nails done and spa, food date, then went back to my house and took a nap. I asked if anything happened at the party, and she swore no guys were there. But her phone rang during our nap, and she got flustered. I pressed, and she admitted it was an ex she’d had a sexual history with before we met. She claimed it was “just two random calls,” but I wasn’t convinced. She admitted she spoke with him twice on the day of the calls but said it was “nothing”

After she begged me not to leave her, I checked her phone (she swore that was the extent it and there was nothing else I’d find). On Snapchat, I found this ex under a fake name. She’d sent him her address on a week or so before, they had an expiring streak and he sent a video snap. They’d been talking since May.. over a month of secret chats. I went to text messages, I found texts with same guy AND deleted texts with two other guys she claimed weren’t at the party she just went to, but she claimed they had spoken with the girls ok FaceTime while there. One guy’s texts mentioned being in a car with her, with flirty stuff from her too like “hola mi amor” and “yes papi.” I’m pretty sure she cheated physically with the ex (she gave him her address) and the party guy (the texts strongly suggest they were in the car alone), plus emotionally and verbally with all three. She denies the physical cheating.

I was gutted but stayed calm. I said those men could have her, she begged me not to leave, crying on the floor holding my legs, stating every reason why those guys are not what she wants and how they’d never be what I am to her (we literally were as serious as marriage). She stayed and took off work Monday to be with me, promising to delete Snapchat, insta, and do “whatever it takes.” But I felt she was still hiding things. That night Monday, I called her cousin, who confirmed four guys were at the party, including the two she texted. This broke her lies about no guys and confirmed more that she most likely did cheat physically in the car.

After the big reveal of the last lie, she flipped, blamed me for being controlling, said she lied so I wouldn’t “get mad” and ruin her “fun,” and even said she didn’t want to be with me, comparing me to the guy she’d been talking to. We’re tied financially I’m the main buyer on the car we co-financed (shes co-buyer for her credit), and she gave me her old car, which I’m paying her for monthly. I also bought her a $1,200 phone on my plan, which I’ve been paying for.

Tuesday, she was supposed to come over to talk but bailed, saying she was tired. I drove to her place to break up but couldn’t do it. I told her I need more from her and won’t wait another day. She said to stop pressuring her and let her “do it on her own.” As I drove home, she suggested meeting at a coffee shop on Thursday. Wednesday, she called me while she worked and said she’s busy but wants to meet today instead to talk. We did, she’s emotionless, has no hint of fear of losing me or remorse anymore compared to Sunday night/Monday. She also said she’s no longer willing to do the things she said “whatever it takes” to fix this like deleting Snapchat and still sharing her location, and is so concerned about still being able to go out to those parties (they’re not often though).

I’m 100% sure she cheated emotionally, verbally, and physically, and her lies (only admitting things when caught) destroy me. I love her and don’t want to leave, but she’s forced my hand with this, I can’t be with someone who cheats and lies. I told her from day one, “respect and loyalty are my #1, zero tolerance, break those and were immediately done”, but I’m having a harder time navigating this than I thought I would. Today she’s careless as well with zero effort and I don’t want to be strung along any longer. 

Any insight? Advice?
How do I navigate moving on after being betrayed by someone I genuinely believed would never do this to me?
How do I handle the breakup conversation to get closure without getting sucked into her blame or manipulation?

I know I’m not thinking 100% straight as normal considering this situation is a huge devastation. Thanks guys for reading.

TLDR: My girlfriend cheated emotionally, verbally, and physically with multiple people (1 month-long secret chats, sent him her address) and two guys from a party (flirty texts suggesting intimate time), lied repeatedly, and only admitted things when caught. I met with her to try and end things but I couldn’t yet. How do I navigate the breakup, and move on?",1,1751559810.0,dating_advice,18,0.56,False

Having the attitude to match! Her gothic charm, that was about her! For as long as she could always remember, remember having a fascination for dark mysterious men. As she then in her mind, saw from deep within the fog and shadows! A man lurking! As he just stood there all dressed up long dark tailcoat gothic style cost. With his dark curly hair and goatee! Just standing there looking over to her. As he then said to Christina’ 

“Why go ahead my dear, and you just say the words! And we shall go from there.”

As he then just vanished back into the foggy night! Leaving Christina’ even more curious more than ever now. Standing there running her fingers through her dark hair! Knowing that she had always been surrounded by their presence alone. Always finding herself being drawn closer to them by wanting to be with them! 

Always wanting to find the darker side of a person! But at the same time not always understanding them. But always finding herself amongst them loving them even if it left her in the dark. If it was for a night of hard sex! Or just finding herself hanging out with them! Looking for the darker side of them. 

But for her! That fascination would leave her in feeling more than words one can say! Or at least one can try to say! But! Legend has it that on that day in 1849’ when after five days that when they first found him! Being the one and only 

Edgar Allan Poe’

It is said that the cause of his death remains unknown! But it is said that on the night of when they first found him. That if one! Or others were to stand at his grave and chant the words 

“Who Killed Edgar Allan Poe’”

That they just might find out!

But as Christina’ stood there hearing the sounds of darkness all around her! Seeing as the fog would begin to in close on her! With her now seeing nothing but the dimming of a street light off in the distance. But as she looked closer! The same figure was now standing there! Up underneath the street light. 

Standing there as the sounds of a black bird! Could be heard as it flew by her! As if it was beckoning for her to come! To be and be with him! As she just stood there looking at a dark figure wearing a long dark gothic style tailcoat! Feeling him beckoning for her to come to him! 

As he just stood there directly in front of her! Hearing the sounds of the black bird calling out her name! As the darkness grew even around her! But as quickly as he had come once more! He was now hidden back into the fog from which he had come. As Christina’ now stood there looking at a gravestone. Not just any gravestone! But being that of a one Edgar Allen Poe’

Standing there looking out into the forever of the darkness of the night! Up underneath a starless nights sky. But if one was to wish upon a star, it would be for one more night for her! one more night to feel him once more. To feel his hands once again up against her! Showing her the feeling that she had yarned for! As her heart was pounding for more, knowing that once with him! Just wasn’t enough for her.

Standing there trying her best to think back on what happened the last five days. Even contemplating to herself! If she really even cared! For they had made their own choice in doing this! But regardless it was Five days! that she will never forget! For they will be

Never More for her to know.

Never more to know him! And that just wasn’t good enough for her! Standing there thinking to herself! Should she say it! Should she say the words! For her fascination with dark mysterious men would definitely end with him. But dam! His he could make her feel that way one more time! Then death! Bring your ass on! 

But a girl could always dream, but not this girl! She wanted more than just dreams of him! She wanted to feel him again! Even if it was to be

NeverMore!

But as she stood there thinking to herself! Should she say?

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe?”

But Christina’ being a dark haired girl! Having that gothic charm! Knew that she was going to get what she wanted! With her even knowing what happened five nights ago! Even though she could have never dreamed of anything of this ever happening to anyone! But hey! They asked for it! And she was a girl with needs! Needs that needed to be filled! By the one! Who could have her being 

NeverMore!

But for now! Shall we go back to five nights prior! Five nights ago when it all started! But the story will not be starting at night, but that morning, after waking up from a good night of sex. Sex that Christina’ was looking forward to! But still leaving her not feeling completely satisfied! 

As she lay there thinking to herself! Was it good Enough? But as usual! Finding herself waking up to an half empty bed beside her. For her so called lover! If one could even can call him that! But to her! After a good night of fucking for him! Just wasn’t enough for her! Guessing that’s why her so called lover! Would always show his ass the door before she could! 


Always finding them gone by morning! Gone before waking up! As she lay there looking up to the ceiling as she said!

“I swear! Guys these days! Just want to get there dicks wet then split!”

Always leave her just to finish the rest of the job herself! it’s like goodbye! Thanks for the fuck! More like a smack on my ass! And a kiss on my cheek! Was there way of Telling me! Hey your ass and the ride was great! But dam! This girl needs more than just a dick and a smack on her ass. 

But hey! If you can find a guy who can say more than a words! And do more than just fuck! It’s like hey! my ass is all they want to talk to! Well next time! My ass is going to be doing a hell of lot more talking! If the sounds of my farts is all that they want hear as they fuck me! Then so be it! 

For if they leave me wanting more! Then I’m just going to blow some wind in there face! And tell them to not let the dam door hit them on their ass! They can just leave! If they leave me unfinished and not filled! But hey sometimes a touch can go much further them one knows. 

I mean hell! If I could get just one guy wanting to touch more than my ass! As he fucks me! Then leaves knowing that his little cock got all up in me! Dam! What is a girl to do just get a touch nowadays, 

For God knows a girl wants more than just a smack on the ass! But it wouldn’t be God that answered her! But someone much darker! To match her gothic style! Leaving her feeling like a girl that has been fulfilled! And occasional holding would be nice! But I guess that would be asking too much! For in a way Christina’ would always leave herself wishing for more.

But when darkness is all she knows then there just isn’t much room left for love! Only sex! But God knows when she will get fully filled again! maybe another week or two! Whenever the need for someone to fuck her again kicks in!

Now finding herself getting out of bed seeing the light of day peering into her room like a perv! It wanted to see more of her standing there nude ass and all to see! But with a quick pull of the shade and out you go. 

Walking into the bathroom as Christina’ stood there looking into the mirror, looking at herself! Slowly sliding her hand through her dark hair. Knowing dam well that she could do much better than the guys around her. 

Standing there looking at 45 year old girl! Wondering to herself 45 and only a fuck buddy! Well the fuck buddy! Needs to fuck a hell of lot better! Because if I’m going to give someone my inside! Then they dam well better feel me up all through the night! But being on her own isn’t so bad! It gives her the freedom to be free! 

Deciding to finally to get dressed for the day, a little dark eye liner here and there! slapping on a pair of stone washed cut at the knees jeans! Along with a black shirt to go with it. This gothic girl was ready for whatever the day would bring to her! And bring it would in a way that would leave her Not forgetting anytime soon. Not forgetting about the shoes! A pair a converses! And with that! To venture into whatever finds her! And find her something would! Something that she could have never imagined that would be! But imagined is beyond belief! This was beyond death itself!

Making her way out the door of her apartment here the usual get the hell out! From her neighbor, I guess she didn’t get her feel either! Not even making it off of her floor! When she then came upon a scene that would forever leave her asking? Is death even dead! 

Coming to the end of the hallway seeing a couple of cops standing there, standing there with their dicks in their hands as usual around here. Standing there just outside of jimmy’s apartment. Jimmy’ was someone that she would talk to every now and then, not as friends! But more like a neighbor. 

For Jimmy’ was into some serious, dark shit! Some Very dark shit! That often had Christina’ questioning at times! As she then stopped to ask one of the officers, just long enough for him to quit holding his dick in his hands. If anything had happened! But as usual the dicks just didn’t know what ass to look or go up! 

Only knowing the hookers around the corner, And not really to her surprise the officer didn’t know dick! As he just told me that the landlord had found jimmy dead! As Christina’ then thought to herself 

“Well no shit! How about you get your dick out of your hands and actually do some detective shit!”

But that was just too much to ask, but apparently someone had Murdered! Jimmy’ sometime in the night, but who? Officer dick sure wasn’t going to find out, who murdered Jimmy. The only the thing they were finding was their lunch! But as Christina’ then walked by the opened door she could see Jimmy’s body lying there all covered on the floor. With blood all on the floor! 

But Not being unnerved enough by that, bit what was just above him, written on the wall was the words written 

NeverMore! 

Just then as a Blackbird flew into an open window landing on it’s bottom frame as it the crowed 

“NeverMore!! NeverMore!

Like she said, Jimmy’ was into some serious, dark shit! Walking on past making her way outside, where she would run into another guy. Someone that Christina’ didn’t mind talking to every now and then, that also lived here.

His name was Johnny’ a dark skinned guy, always in his leather black jacket! Sunny outside or not, With his eyes and hair to match! Someone that Christina’ would often find herself talking to, in a way often finding herself wanting to get close at times. But he already had someone, as Christina’ then thought to her herself, at least Johnny’ knew how to please someone. But as Christina’ then walked up to him asking if he had heard anything of what happened to Jimmy’ With Johnny only giving a snark remark! Saying to her! 

“Look! I don’t know! Johnny was into some shady shit and stuff! More than likely a drug debt!” 

With Christina’ then looking to him saying to him in also in a snarky remark 

“Look. I know! Well sorts knew Jimmy’ much more she should have known about him! and he wasn’t into drugs Johnny’ he was into some serious dark shit! But drugs! You don’t have to be so snarky you know”

With Johnny just looking at her, as he then threw his cigarette onto the ground as he said then said to her

“Look! The other night me and Jimmy and a couple of other people, who I didn’t know who they were! went down to the Graveyard the other night. And when you said that Jimmy was into some dark shit you wasn’t kidding. I only went along for the ride! But him and the other ones was there for something else!”

With Christina’ then replying 

“Something else! What do you mean something else!”

As Johnny just stared at her giving her a look of disbelief! Before saying 

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

As Christina’ then looked back at him curious like then saying 

“What! What do you mean? Edgar Allan Poe”

As Johnny always acting the cool guy just looked to Christina’ saying to her 

“Yeah that! We was at his grave sight with some candles and shit! When they started to try to summon something by chanting!”

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

“I mean, I was only along for the ride you know but who knows!”

But as Christina’ then left Johnny to be! She then just made her way about the day, just wondering to what he had said. But Later that night as the darkness of the night was just beginning to set in. A moonless night at that, But as the darkness would come, so would the sounds of other things that night would follow with it. 

Standing there on the roof looking out into the city landscape, still thinking of what Johnny had said to her. As a guy off in the distance was shredding away on his guitar! Knowing that darkness was coming for someone that night leaving them to be

But deep down within the city we find a young dark haired guy, named Chang’ wearing jeans and a jacket, just making his way out from a corner coffee shop. Carrying a laptop from which he had been working on his novel, but unfortunately for him, a little chanting her had done just a couple of nights ago. 

Asking 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe

But as just as Chang’ then turned a corner hearing a voice say to him

“For insane I have became! Insane to a world in which wants to know who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

With Chang’ now turning only to see a dark haired man with a goatee, wearing a gothic style black turn tail coat. Watching him as he then made his way from out of the darkened alley way. Asking Chang’

“So a writer I see you want to be, but how insane can you be!” 

As Chang’ then said back to him

“Who are you? And why do want to know about me wanting to be a writer?”

As the figure then said to Chang’ 

“Is it not I that you seek? To see how insane I have become to a world that wishes to know”

As Chang’ then replied back saying to him

“What do you mean, is not I that I seek? I seek no one! Now leave me be!”

But as the figure then walked closer to Chang’ saying to him

“Oh but you do, you seek to know how insane I have become! So now I will tell you!”

As Chang’ then said back to him

“Tell me what!”

As the figure then replied back to Chang’ saying 

Who killed Edgar Alan Poe

For dead he did indeed leave Chang’ letting him know on how insane he had become to the world. For Chang’ was now

NeverMore

But as her thoughts would go, so would the night. Leaving someone to be NeverMore! As the morning would come, with Christina’ not really wanting to get up,deciding to lay there in her bed listening whatever was on the television. As her fingers just filled in the rest! 

But as she watched the morning news a segment would then catch her attention, and her attention it did! For they the news crew was at a scene of a murder that had happened last night. But as they were talking to the detective, some words would suddenly came into view, as the camera would then show the words. For written on the wall behind them were the words 

“NeverMore!”

Quickly getting out of bed and getting herself dressed! Making her way down town, at least trying to make her way downtown with being harassed by a couple of guys wanting to know her ass. But as Christina’ being the girl she was just turned around giving them the bird! 

As a blackbird then flew by them saying to them

NeverMore

But to the scene Christina’ made her way, to scene of the murder, of person with no head for it would never be found as they were NeverMore to world around them. As Christina’ stood there looking at the words, just as a Blackbird! Then Flew by me landing on a railing, crowning!

“NeverMore! NeverMore!”

Standing there now looking at the Blackbird just as it then flew off into the day! Leaving the dead person to be! And Leaving her now with more questions than answers! As Christina’ then made her way back across town looking for Johnny with no luck. 

But as day turned into night! Finding herself standing on top of the roof of her building looking out into the city’s landscape. As the same guy was just a shredding away on his guitar. Thinking to herself there had to be a connection with the murders! But what! Or who? For as the next two nights would come! So would two more murders! Leaving them to be

NeverMore

With the same words written 

“NeverMore!”

But as the dead of night would once again leave, 
Bringing with it a new day! Just not for some! Making her way out of her apartment and into the street. Where she would finally run into Johnny’! Making her way over to him kinda yelling at him asking him!

“The three other people that was with you and Jimmy’ were they the ones murdered the last three nights”!

With Johnny just looking at her giving her his same snarky remark saying to her

“Look! I was only along the ride! Those other four were there for some serious dark shit! But if you are so worried about me turning up murdered! Then you need not worry yourself toots”! 

With Christina’ just standing there shaking her head at Johnny as I said to him

“ Yeah well good luck with that shit Johnny!”

Leaving him to be, now going about her day waiting for the night to come, but darkness was never far away. as Christina’ would wait to see if Johnny was right about that or not. But she just guessed  we shall find out soon enough. And soon enough she would leaving her feeling like no one has ever before.

Now Finding herself once again standing there on the roof thinking to herself! the bride once again to be! Looking out into the endless night. Thinking That there was going to be no honeymoon for her anytime soon! 

Standing there looking out into a city landscape of street lights glaring into the city’s night, Just as she then suddenly heard a sound behind her. Turning to only see an individual wearing a solid black gothic style tailcoat old school style! More like the turn of the century style 

With his face being hidden by the shadows of the night just as a Blackbird then flew by her landing on the ledge beside her crowing

“NeverMore!”

Just as the individual standing there looking at her then said to her

“I have became insane! to a world that wants to know!” More than they should know!”

“But For those who chose not to know! never to suffer would they! But instead! Never to been blessed!

“Do you want to know? My love!

As Christina’ then said back to him

“Do I want to know what”?

Laughing as he then walked closer to her revealing more of what she wanted to see! As the shadow of the night slowly left from his face. Revealing everything that she wanted to see! Leaving her wanted to know more! For standing there in front of her was a dark haired man around 40’ with a goatee, wearing a solid long black tail coat. Wearing clothes not of this century 

Leaving Christina’ more enticed than ever! Her eyes and heart were now set into place! Wanting more! More than she even dared herself to ask! But resist she could not! For mesmerizing something about him was! A feeling of need he had, a desire that she just could not hide. 

Finding herself now wanting to know more of that night!

As he then smiled at her saying to her

Are you sure that you don’t want to know?

With her again asking him

“know what?”

Knowing that she very much wanted to know more! To know everything about him! 

As he then laughed at me saying to me 

“To know me! Is to know Death! For I have become insane! But to those wishing to know more! I share not what one seeks! But choose instead to only show what one may desire to know”

And desired to know more Christina’ did! Finding herself now coming closer to him, knowing that something about him was more than she wanted to know. But resist she could not! For his presence alone left her feeling it all up inside of her. 

As he then approached her slowly placing his hand on the side of her head, massaging his fingers slowly through her hair. Christina’ was now fully engaged to wanting to know more! More of his touch! Her need to be filled was here and in a big way! And feel it! She very much was! Feeling his hand upon her, every desire of wanting to know more! Was now wanting more! 

As he then placed both of his hands on her head sliding them slowly through her hair, as Christina’ body was ready for his touch! To show her what she had been looking for! With him now looking at her as he then said 

“To know more, is to desire what one wants to feel! And if to feel your need? Then my desire to know you.”

The desire was here, Christina’ thoughts were here, my body was all his! And all he needed to do was feed my desire. The desire to feel every part of him!

Taking off his coat as he placed it on the ground, as he then looked to her placing his finger up to her lips. before saying to her 

“ I know your desire! Now let me know you! 

Christina’ was there! Her desire was now his to do with as he pleased! As he slowly slid his hand down the side of her face, sliding his fingers over  and under her shirt and across her chest! Christina’ heart was pounding! Her body was there in complete control of his hands. Christina’ could feel the sweat on her, ready for his body to be on her. 

For this girl might not be a bride to be! But for one night! She just may need a priest to exercise what ever he puts into her

For she was going to be screaming to the heavens above that hells fire was now burning inside of her, Feeling the heat from his touch, 

Feeling his lips slowly touching her, Pulling her closer feeling his chest up next to hers, With his hands slowly gliding across her back! She wanted this to last all night. To feel hells fire burn within her! 

Her body was pulsating! To his very touch! As he then slowly took off her shirt feeling his fingers slowly sliding across her breast! Feeling his breath as her body! now fully up against her as he then whispering to her ear. 

“Tonight my love I will know you as you desire!”

As the flames would ride higher! So would he! As he then slowly lay me down upon coat, sliding his hands through her hair. 

Christina’ body was now on fire from the inside! Feeling the burn of his touch inside of her! , slowly sliding his hands across her chest. Feeling and teasing her nipples, the sweat pouring from her. 

As he then Massaged her breasts with his hands, with his tongue dancing and slowly gliding around all around her neck. Up to her Christina’s cheek, As Christina’ lay there with her hands now firmly on him, pulling him tighter up against her. Feeling him rub all up against her, With her hands now slowly sliding down his back onto his ass feeling him. Rub himself all up and down her! Before slowly sliding his hands back across her stomach down to her pants. 

Looking at her as he then unzipped her pants sliding them off of her! As his fingers danced around in her! feeling his hands coming back up through her legs. Teasing her inside, as Christina held on! Feeling his breath on her neck as his fingers danced around in her. 

Before slowly Sliding his hands back  up her legs, slinging up to firmly grabbing a hold of her ass. As his tongue found its way all around her neck. Up and into her mouth, as his fingers danced away inside of her. 

Hell was definitely on fire that night! With his hand now firmly holding me against her! Going in and out her! Feeling every finger as his hand danced around inside of her! 

As he then raised back up taking off his shirt and pants! Just Before placing his body once again upon her. 

feeling his sweat as he then placed her hands around his back moving them up behind his head. 

Christina’ could now feel every bit of him going deep inside of her! Her hands now firmly grabbing a hold of his back 

As the Devil was now looking up to Christina Ricci’ saying

“Dam! I would give up hell just to be in her!” 

As there bodies were now becoming one, to the night!  as they then slowly made love on the roof not really caring if anyone was watching. For as the night went on so did he! For Christina’ had never made love to anyone like she did to him that night. 

But as good things come, they also have to go! 

But just before he would disappear forever into back into the night, he then turned to Christina’ asking her

“Do you want to know?”

With Christina’ now looking at him saying 

“Know what?

With him just looking at her before saying 

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

With Christina’ then asking 

“Who!”

As he then just laughed as he said

“I did!

“I killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

As he then just looked at her laughing as he then just vanished into the night never to seen again.

As the Blackbird behind her once again crowed!

“NeverMore!” 

Just before it flew off into the night!

While him leaving her knowing that her every desire he did feel that night, leaving Christina’ even more fascinated to find out more about him. Drawing her closer to him. For to know his love, his insanity, to feel him once more! is to know the darkness that he has become!

Leaving her now standing there on the roof thinking to herself what about Johnny? Did he kill Johnny?

But she guessed that she will just have to wait until the morning! But if so, then Johnny would be

NeverMore!

Leaving Christina Ricci’ then asking herself? Dose she now want to be 

NeverMore herself

1lqtr8z,https://i.redd.it/su2c0v2spoaf1.jpeg,NeverMore’ Who killed Edgar Allan Poe,"For as long as Christina Ricci’ a forty five year old brown eyed, dark haired girl! Having the attitude to match! Her gothic charm, that was about her! For as long as she could always remember, remember having a fascination for dark mysterious men. As she then in her mind, saw from deep within the fog and shadows! A man lurking! As he just stood there all dressed up long dark tailcoat gothic style cost. With his dark curly hair and goatee! Just standing there looking over to her. As he then said to Christina’ 

“Why go ahead my dear, and you just say the words! And we shall go from there.”

As he then just vanished back into the foggy night! Leaving Christina’ even more curious more than ever now. Standing there running her fingers through her dark hair! Knowing that she had always been surrounded by their presence alone. Always finding herself being drawn closer to them by wanting to be with them! 

Always wanting to find the darker side of a person! But at the same time not always understanding them. But always finding herself amongst them loving them even if it left her in the dark. If it was for a night of hard sex! Or just finding herself hanging out with them! Looking for the darker side of them. 

But for her! That fascination would leave her in feeling more than words one can say! Or at least one can try to say! But! Legend has it that on that day in 1849’ when after five days that when they first found him! Being the one and only 

Edgar Allan Poe’

It is said that the cause of his death remains unknown! But it is said that on the night of when they first found him. That if one! Or others were to stand at his grave and chant the words 

“Who Killed Edgar Allan Poe’”

That they just might find out!

But as Christina’ stood there hearing the sounds of darkness all around her! Seeing as the fog would begin to in close on her! With her now seeing nothing but the dimming of a street light off in the distance. But as she looked closer! The same figure was now standing there! Up underneath the street light. 

Standing there as the sounds of a black bird! Could be heard as it flew by her! As if it was beckoning for her to come! To be and be with him! As she just stood there looking at a dark figure wearing a long dark gothic style tailcoat! Feeling him beckoning for her to come to him! 

As he just stood there directly in front of her! Hearing the sounds of the black bird calling out her name! As the darkness grew even around her! But as quickly as he had come once more! He was now hidden back into the fog from which he had come. As Christina’ now stood there looking at a gravestone. Not just any gravestone! But being that of a one Edgar Allen Poe’

Standing there looking out into the forever of the darkness of the night! Up underneath a starless nights sky. But if one was to wish upon a star, it would be for one more night for her! one more night to feel him once more. To feel his hands once again up against her! Showing her the feeling that she had yarned for! As her heart was pounding for more, knowing that once with him! Just wasn’t enough for her.

Standing there trying her best to think back on what happened the last five days. Even contemplating to herself! If she really even cared! For they had made their own choice in doing this! But regardless it was Five days! that she will never forget! For they will be

Never More for her to know.

Never more to know him! And that just wasn’t good enough for her! Standing there thinking to herself! Should she say it! Should she say the words! For her fascination with dark mysterious men would definitely end with him. But dam! His he could make her feel that way one more time! Then death! Bring your ass on! 

But a girl could always dream, but not this girl! She wanted more than just dreams of him! She wanted to feel him again! Even if it was to be

NeverMore!

But as she stood there thinking to herself! Should she say?

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe?”

But Christina’ being a dark haired girl! Having that gothic charm! Knew that she was going to get what she wanted! With her even knowing what happened five nights ago! Even though she could have never dreamed of anything of this ever happening to anyone! But hey! They asked for it! And she was a girl with needs! Needs that needed to be filled! By the one! Who could have her being 

NeverMore!

But for now! Shall we go back to five nights prior! Five nights ago when it all started! But the story will not be starting at night, but that morning, after waking up from a good night of sex. Sex that Christina’ was looking forward to! But still leaving her not feeling completely satisfied! 

As she lay there thinking to herself! Was it good Enough? But as usual! Finding herself waking up to an half empty bed beside her. For her so called lover! If one could even can call him that! But to her! After a good night of fucking for him! Just wasn’t enough for her! Guessing that’s why her so called lover! Would always show his ass the door before she could! 


Always finding them gone by morning! Gone before waking up! As she lay there looking up to the ceiling as she said!

“I swear! Guys these days! Just want to get there dicks wet then split!”

Always leave her just to finish the rest of the job herself! it’s like goodbye! Thanks for the fuck! More like a smack on my ass! And a kiss on my cheek! Was there way of Telling me! Hey your ass and the ride was great! But dam! This girl needs more than just a dick and a smack on her ass. 

But hey! If you can find a guy who can say more than a words! And do more than just fuck! It’s like hey! my ass is all they want to talk to! Well next time! My ass is going to be doing a hell of lot more talking! If the sounds of my farts is all that they want hear as they fuck me! Then so be it! 

For if they leave me wanting more! Then I’m just going to blow some wind in there face! And tell them to not let the dam door hit them on their ass! They can just leave! If they leave me unfinished and not filled! But hey sometimes a touch can go much further them one knows. 

I mean hell! If I could get just one guy wanting to touch more than my ass! As he fucks me! Then leaves knowing that his little cock got all up in me! Dam! What is a girl to do just get a touch nowadays, 

For God knows a girl wants more than just a smack on the ass! But it wouldn’t be God that answered her! But someone much darker! To match her gothic style! Leaving her feeling like a girl that has been fulfilled! And occasional holding would be nice! But I guess that would be asking too much! For in a way Christina’ would always leave herself wishing for more.

But when darkness is all she knows then there just isn’t much room left for love! Only sex! But God knows when she will get fully filled again! maybe another week or two! Whenever the need for someone to fuck her again kicks in!

Now finding herself getting out of bed seeing the light of day peering into her room like a perv! It wanted to see more of her standing there nude ass and all to see! But with a quick pull of the shade and out you go. 

Walking into the bathroom as Christina’ stood there looking into the mirror, looking at herself! Slowly sliding her hand through her dark hair. Knowing dam well that she could do much better than the guys around her. 

Standing there looking at 45 year old girl! Wondering to herself 45 and only a fuck buddy! Well the fuck buddy! Needs to fuck a hell of lot better! Because if I’m going to give someone my inside! Then they dam well better feel me up all through the night! But being on her own isn’t so bad! It gives her the freedom to be free! 

Deciding to finally to get dressed for the day, a little dark eye liner here and there! slapping on a pair of stone washed cut at the knees jeans! Along with a black shirt to go with it. This gothic girl was ready for whatever the day would bring to her! And bring it would in a way that would leave her Not forgetting anytime soon. Not forgetting about the shoes! A pair a converses! And with that! To venture into whatever finds her! And find her something would! Something that she could have never imagined that would be! But imagined is beyond belief! This was beyond death itself!

Only knowing the hookers around the corner, And not really to her surprise the officer didn’t know dick! As he just told me that the landlord had found jimmy dead! As Christina’ then thought to herself 

“Well no shit! How about you get your dick out of your hands and actually do some detective shit!”

But that was just too much to ask, but apparently someone had Murdered! Jimmy’ sometime in the night, but who? Officer dick sure wasn’t going to find out, who murdered Jimmy. The only the thing they were finding was their lunch! But as Christina’ then walked by the opened door she could see Jimmy’s body lying there all covered on the floor. With blood all on the floor! 

But Not being unnerved enough by that, bit what was just above him, written on the wall was the words written 

NeverMore! 

Just then as a Blackbird flew into an open window landing on it’s bottom frame as it the crowed 

“NeverMore!! NeverMore!

Like she said, Jimmy’ was into some serious, dark shit! Walking on past making her way outside, where she would run into another guy. Someone that Christina’ didn’t mind talking to every now and then, that also lived here.

His name was Johnny’ a dark skinned guy, always in his leather black jacket! Sunny outside or not, With his eyes and hair to match! Someone that Christina’ would often find herself talking to, in a way often finding herself wanting to get close at times. But he already had someone, as Christina’ then thought to her herself, at least Johnny’ knew how to please someone. But as Christina’ then walked up to him asking if he had heard anything of what happened to Jimmy’ With Johnny only giving a snark remark! Saying to her!

With Johnny just looking at her, as he then threw his cigarette onto the ground as he said then said to her

“Look! The other night me and Jimmy and a couple of other people, who I didn’t know who they were! went down to the Graveyard the other night. And when you said that Jimmy was into some dark shit you wasn’t kidding. I only went along for the ride! But him and the other ones was there for something else!”

With Christina’ then replying 

“Something else! What do you mean something else!”

As Johnny just stared at her giving her a look of disbelief! Before saying 

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

As Christina’ then looked back at him curious like then saying 

“What! What do you mean? Edgar Allan Poe”

As Johnny always acting the cool guy just looked to Christina’ saying to her 

“Yeah that! We was at his grave sight with some candles and shit! When they started to try to summon something by chanting!”

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

“I mean, I was only along for the ride you know but who knows!”

But as Christina’ then left Johnny to be! She then just made her way about the day, just wondering to what he had said. But Later that night as the darkness of the night was just beginning to set in. A moonless night at that, But as the darkness would come, so would the sounds of other things that night would follow with it. 

Standing there on the roof looking out into the city landscape, still thinking of what Johnny had said to her. As a guy off in the distance was shredding away on his guitar! Knowing that darkness was coming for someone that night leaving them to be

But deep down within the city we find a young dark haired guy, named Chang’ wearing jeans and a jacket, just making his way out from a corner coffee shop. Carrying a laptop from which he had been working on his novel, but unfortunately for him, a little chanting her had done just a couple of nights ago. 

Asking 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe

But as just as Chang’ then turned a corner hearing a voice say to him

“For insane I have became! Insane to a world in which wants to know who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

With Chang’ now turning only to see a dark haired man with a goatee, wearing a gothic style black turn tail coat. Watching him as he then made his way from out of the darkened alley way. Asking Chang’

“So a writer I see you want to be, but how insane can you be!” 

As Chang’ then said back to him

“Who are you? And why do want to know about me wanting to be a writer?”

As the figure then said to Chang’ 

“Is it not I that you seek? To see how insane I have become to a world that wishes to know”

As Chang’ then replied back saying to him

“What do you mean, is not I that I seek? I seek no one! Now leave me be!”

But as the figure then walked closer to Chang’ saying to him

“Oh but you do, you seek to know how insane I have become! So now I will tell you!”

As Chang’ then said back to him

“Tell me what!”

As the figure then replied back to Chang’ saying 

Who killed Edgar Alan Poe

For dead he did indeed leave Chang’ letting him know on how insane he had become to the world. For Chang’ was now

NeverMore

But as her thoughts would go, so would the night. Leaving someone to be NeverMore! As the morning would come, with Christina’ not really wanting to get up,deciding to lay there in her bed listening whatever was on the television. As her fingers just filled in the rest! 

But as she watched the morning news a segment would then catch her attention, and her attention it did! For they the news crew was at a scene of a murder that had happened last night. But as they were talking to the detective, some words would suddenly came into view, as the camera would then show the words. For written on the wall behind them were the words 

“NeverMore!”

Quickly getting out of bed and getting herself dressed! Making her way down town, at least trying to make her way downtown with being harassed by a couple of guys wanting to know her ass. But as Christina’ being the girl she was just turned around giving them the bird! 

As a blackbird then flew by them saying to them

NeverMore

But to the scene Christina’ made her way, to scene of the murder, of person with no head for it would never be found as they were NeverMore to world around them. As Christina’ stood there looking at the words, just as a Blackbird! Then Flew by me landing on a railing, crowning!

“NeverMore! NeverMore!”

Standing there now looking at the Blackbird just as it then flew off into the day! Leaving the dead person to be! And Leaving her now with more questions than answers! As Christina’ then made her way back across town looking for Johnny with no luck. 

But as day turned into night! Finding herself standing on top of the roof of her building looking out into the city’s landscape. As the same guy was just a shredding away on his guitar. Thinking to herself there had to be a connection with the murders! But what! Or who? For as the next two nights would come! So would two more murders! Leaving them to be

NeverMore

With the same words written 

“NeverMore!”

But as the dead of night would once again leave, 
Bringing with it a new day! Just not for some! Making her way out of her apartment and into the street. Where she would finally run into Johnny’! Making her way over to him kinda yelling at him asking him!

“The three other people that was with you and Jimmy’ were they the ones murdered the last three nights”!

With Johnny just looking at her giving her his same snarky remark saying to her

“Look! I was only along the ride! Those other four were there for some serious dark shit! But if you are so worried about me turning up murdered! Then you need not worry yourself toots”! 

With Christina’ just standing there shaking her head at Johnny as I said to him

“ Yeah well good luck with that shit Johnny!”

Leaving him to be, now going about her day waiting for the night to come, but darkness was never far away. as Christina’ would wait to see if Johnny was right about that or not. But she just guessed  we shall find out soon enough. And soon enough she would leaving her feeling like no one has ever before.

Now Finding herself once again standing there on the roof thinking to herself! the bride once again to be! Looking out into the endless night. Thinking That there was going to be no honeymoon for her anytime soon! 

Standing there looking out into a city landscape of street lights glaring into the city’s night, Just as she then suddenly heard a sound behind her. Turning to only see an individual wearing a solid black gothic style tailcoat old school style! More like the turn of the century style 

With his face being hidden by the shadows of the night just as a Blackbird then flew by her landing on the ledge beside her crowing

“NeverMore!”

Just as the individual standing there looking at her then said to her

“I have became insane! to a world that wants to know!” More than they should know!”

“But For those who chose not to know! never to suffer would they! But instead! Never to been blessed!

“Do you want to know? My love!

As Christina’ then said back to him

“Do I want to know what”?

Laughing as he then walked closer to her revealing more of what she wanted to see! As the shadow of the night slowly left from his face. Revealing everything that she wanted to see! Leaving her wanted to know more! For standing there in front of her was a dark haired man around 40’ with a goatee, wearing a solid long black tail coat. Wearing clothes not of this century 

Leaving Christina’ more enticed than ever! Her eyes and heart were now set into place! Wanting more! More than she even dared herself to ask! But resist she could not! For mesmerizing something about him was! A feeling of need he had, a desire that she just could not hide. 

Finding herself now wanting to know more of that night!

As he then smiled at her saying to her

Are you sure that you don’t want to know?

With her again asking him

“know what?”

Knowing that she very much wanted to know more! To know everything about him! 

As he then laughed at me saying to me 

“To know me! Is to know Death! For I have become insane! But to those wishing to know more! I share not what one seeks! But choose instead to only show what one may desire to know”

And desired to know more Christina’ did! Finding herself now coming closer to him, knowing that something about him was more than she wanted to know. But resist she could not! For his presence alone left her feeling it all up inside of her. 

As he then approached her slowly placing his hand on the side of her head, massaging his fingers slowly through her hair. Christina’ was now fully engaged to wanting to know more! More of his touch! Her need to be filled was here and in a big way! And feel it! She very much was! Feeling his hand upon her, every desire of wanting to know more! Was now wanting more! 

As he then placed both of his hands on her head sliding them slowly through her hair, as Christina’ body was ready for his touch! To show her what she had been looking for! With him now looking at her as he then said 

“To know more, is to desire what one wants to feel! And if to feel your need? Then my desire to know you.”

The desire was here, Christina’ thoughts were here, my body was all his! And all he needed to do was feed my desire. The desire to feel every part of him!

Taking off his coat as he placed it on the ground, as he then looked to her placing his finger up to her lips. before saying to her 

“ I know your desire! Now let me know you! 

Christina’ was there! Her desire was now his to do with as he pleased! As he slowly slid his hand down the side of her face, sliding his fingers over  and under her shirt and across her chest! Christina’ heart was pounding! Her body was there in complete control of his hands. Christina’ could feel the sweat on her, ready for his body to be on her. 

For this girl might not be a bride to be! But for one night! She just may need a priest to exercise what ever he puts into her

For she was going to be screaming to the heavens above that hells fire was now burning inside of her, Feeling the heat from his touch, 

Feeling his lips slowly touching her, Pulling her closer feeling his chest up next to hers, With his hands slowly gliding across her back! She wanted this to last all night. To feel hells fire burn within her! 

Her body was pulsating! To his very touch! As he then slowly took off her shirt feeling his fingers slowly sliding across her breast! Feeling his breath as her body! now fully up against her as he then whispering to her ear. 

“Tonight my love I will know you as you desire!”

As the flames would ride higher! So would he! As he then slowly lay me down upon coat, sliding his hands through her hair. 

Christina’ body was now on fire from the inside! Feeling the burn of his touch inside of her! , slowly sliding his hands across her chest. Feeling and teasing her nipples, the sweat pouring from her. 

As he then Massaged her breasts with his hands, with his tongue dancing and slowly gliding around all around her neck. Up to her Christina’s cheek, As Christina’ lay there with her hands now firmly on him, pulling him tighter up against her. Feeling him rub all up against her, With her hands now slowly sliding down his back onto his ass feeling him. Rub himself all up and down her! Before slowly sliding his hands back across her stomach down to her pants. 

Looking at her as he then unzipped her pants sliding them off of her! As his fingers danced around in her! feeling his hands coming back up through her legs. Teasing her inside, as Christina held on! Feeling his breath on her neck as his fingers danced around in her. 

Before slowly Sliding his hands back  up her legs, slinging up to firmly grabbing a hold of her ass. As his tongue found its way all around her neck. Up and into her mouth, as his fingers danced away inside of her. 

Hell was definitely on fire that night! With his hand now firmly holding me against her! Going in and out her! Feeling every finger as his hand danced around inside of her! 

As he then raised back up taking off his shirt and pants! Just Before placing his body once again upon her. 

feeling his sweat as he then placed her hands around his back moving them up behind his head. 

Christina’ could now feel every bit of him going deep inside of her! Her hands now firmly grabbing a hold of his back 

As the Devil was now looking up to Christina Ricci’ saying

“Dam! I would give up hell just to be in her!” 

As there bodies were now becoming one, to the night!  as they then slowly made love on the roof not really caring if anyone was watching. For as the night went on so did he! For Christina’ had never made love to anyone like she did to him that night. 

But as good things come, they also have to go! 

But just before he would disappear forever into back into the night, he then turned to Christina’ asking her

“Do you want to know?”

With Christina’ now looking at him saying 

“Know what?

With him just looking at her before saying 

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

With Christina’ then asking 

“Who!”

As he then just laughed as he said

“I did!

“I killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

As he then just looked at her laughing as he then just vanished into the night never to seen again.

As the Blackbird behind her once again crowed!

“NeverMore!” 

Just before it flew off into the night!

While him leaving her knowing that her every desire he did feel that night, leaving Christina’ even more fascinated to find out more about him. Drawing her closer to him. For to know his love, his insanity, to feel him once more! is to know the darkness that he has become!

Leaving her now standing there on the roof thinking to herself what about Johnny? Did he kill Johnny?

But she guessed that she will just have to wait until the morning! But if so, then Johnny would be

I've been having a lot of trouble finding a job and even volunteering roles and recently got offered a volunteering role in a cafe but it's part of a Buddhist meditation centre. To clarify: the role is just working in the cafe, serving coffee/food, etc., so I won't be involved in any of the meditation stuff but it's still a part of that centre. Would this be permissible?
