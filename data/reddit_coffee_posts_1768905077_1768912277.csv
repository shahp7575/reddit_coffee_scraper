1qhzr5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1qhzr5j/aitj_for_demanding_my_cousin_pay_for_my_laptop/,"AITJ for demanding my cousin pay for my laptop after she returned it ""working"" but it was basically ruined?","



I (27F) have a decent laptop I use for freelance stuff and honestly just life admin. My cousin ""Mia"" (19F) is in college and called me freaking out because her cheap school laptop died the week before finals. She asked if she could borrow mine for 4 days just to type papers and upload them. I hesitated, but she promised she would only use it for school, no food or drinks near it, and she would keep it in her dorm. I even made her a separate user profile so she wouldnt mess with my files. She picked it up, thanked me a million times, and that was that.



When she dropped it back off, she was weirdly rushed. Like, handed it to me and said ""it works, I logged out"" and bolted. I opened it later and immediately noticed the keyboard felt sticky, and some keys were kinda crunchy. It also smelled like sweet coffee or maybe an energy drink. The screen would flicker every so often, and the trackpad would randomly stop clicking. I texted her and she swore nothing happened and that maybe it was ""already like that"". I know my own laptop, it was fine the day she took it. I took it to a repair shop and they said liquid had gotten under the keyboard and started corroding stuff. They cleaned what they could but told me it might keep acting up and the keyboard would probaly need replacing. The quote was $260. I sent Mia a pic of the receipt and asked her to cover it, even if she had to pay in installments. She said she ""doesnt have that kind of money"" and that I was being dramatic because she needs money for school. Her mom then messaged me saying family helps family and I shouldnt ""punish"" Mia over an accident, and that I chose to lend it so I accepted the risk. Now half my relatives are acting like I’m a villain for asking a college kid to pay, and Mia is telling people I’m trying to ruin her finals week (which is already over??). I feel like if you borrow someone’s stuff and damage it, you make it right, even if it's awkward.



TL;DR: Lent my cousin my laptop for finals, it came back with liquid damage and repair costs. I asked her to pay and my family says I'm a jerk for it.

1qhzpzt,https://i.redd.it/tg12n9z5zheg1.jpeg,How to Save Money While Traveling in South Korea 🇰🇷 (Real Budget Tips from Experience),"South Korea has a reputation for being expensive, but after traveling across Seoul and a few other cities, I realized it’s actually very manageable even on a tight budget. If you’re planning a trip and want to save money without ruining the experience, here’s what genuinely worked for me.

🍜 1. Eat Like a Local (Not a Tourist)
Food can be cheap if you avoid tourist restaurants.
1 Convenience stores are lifesavers: kimbap, .   . ramen, dosirak (lunch boxes), fried chicken, coffee
2 Street food markets are affordable and filling
3 Local Korean restaurants usually have cheaper lunch menus
4 Eat where office workers eat  that’s the real hack
👉 Average meal cost for me: 5,000–8,000 KRW

🚆 2. Use Public Transport Only
Korea’s public transport is one of the best and cheapest in the world.
1  Buy a T-money card as soon as you arrive
2 Subways and buses cover almost every tourist spot
3 Walking between nearby attractions saves money and shows you real Korea
4 Avoid taxis unless you’re splitting costs with friends
👉 Subway/bus rides usually cost 1,300–1,800 KRW

🏨 3. Skip Hotels, Choose Guesthouses or Hostels
Hotels add up fast. Instead:
1 Stay in hostels or guesthouses (many are super clean and social)
2 Hanok guesthouses can be cheaper and more memorable
3 Some hostels include free breakfast
4 Booking early = better deals
👉 Dorm beds: 20,000–30,000 KRW per night

🎟️ 4. Enjoy Free Attractions
One of the best things about Korea is how many places are free.
1 Palaces often have free days or free entry if you wear hanbok
2  Parks, riversides, temples, and neighborhoods cost nothing
3 Museums and cultural centers often have free exhibitions
👉 Some of my best days cost zero for attractions

🛍️ 5. Shop & Snack Smart
1 Convenience stores are cheaper for small meals 
. than supermarkets
2 Night markets have cheaper souvenirs than malls
3 Avoid buying everything from tourist shops
4 Daiso is amazing for cheap essentials and souvenirs

💡 6. Daily Money-Saving Habits
Small habits make a big difference:
1.  Carry a reusable water bottle
2.Use KakaoMap or Naver Map instead of taxis
3. Avoid unnecessary tours explore solo
 Travel slower  fewer cities = less transport cost

💸 What I Spent Per Day (Approx.)
Accommodation: 25,000 KRW
Food: 15,000–20,000 KRW
Transport: 5,000–8,000 KRW
 Attractions: Mostly free
👉 Total: Around 45,000–55,000 KRW per day
🌏 Final Thoughts

South Korea doesn’t have to be expensive. If you eat local, use public transport, and avoid tourist traps, you can experience the country fully without overspending. Some of my favorite memories came from simple walks, late-night convenience store meals, and free viewpoints.

1qhzpq9,https://i.redd.it/kcg7lpm0zheg1.jpeg,Which banknote do Albanians use the most? - SCAN analysis: What the banknotes show about the Albanian economy - Albania,"Every day, Albanians pay in cash for coffee, food or small services. But which banknote passes from hand to hand most often? And which holds the largest share of cash in the economy?

Data from the Bank of Albania show that the answer is not as straightforward as it seems and varies depending on how the use of cash is measured.

If we talk about the number of banknotes in circulation, i.e. the denominations that are most often used in daily payments, it turns out that the most present are the 1,000 and 2,000 ALL banknotes. They are the denominations that circulate most often in ordinary citizens' transactions, in small purchases and routine payments.

But the panorama changes when the analysis is done in monetary value. According to the structure of cash in circulation, the banknote that carries the largest weight is the 5,000 ALL banknote. Not because it is used more often than other denominations, but because it represents a higher value per unit and concentrates a significant portion of physical money in the economy.

The Bank of Albania's reports show that the structure of banknotes has changed gradually, but without being reversed, despite strong shocks such as the pandemic, the increase in inflation or the introduction into circulation of the 10,000 ALL banknote. Even after these developments, the 5,000 Lek denomination continues to remain the main axis of cash in value.

At the same time, the total number of banknotes in circulation in Albania has remained relatively stable. In the last five years, it is estimated at around 150 to 160 million pieces, indicating that changes are not happening in quantity, but in the way cash is used.

One of the main reasons is related to the gradual shift of small payments towards electronic means. Small denominations, such as 200, 500 and 1,000 ALL, are used less today than before, while bank cards and transfers are replacing cash in frequent payments. This explains why the number of banknotes in circulation remains stable, while their role in the economy is being reshaped.

Another trend evidenced by the reports is that banknotes are ""living"" longer. They are replaced and disposed of less often in relation to the total stock, an indication that cash is circulating more slowly and is being kept longer outside the banking system.

Data show that cash in Albania is not disappearing, but is changing its function: from a daily means of payment, to an instrument of safeguarding and financial security.

cw: mental health issues, implied self-harm, body horror



*part 1, claws and circuits*

I had been sitting in the dark for a long time, just listening to the hum of the outside. The racing of the cars, the chatter of pedestrians, the occasional ambulance. My phone lay beside me with a black screen. I didn’t bother touching it, not even to tap and check the time. There was no point - It had been dead for days.

I threw my legs over the side of my bed, the comforters falling around me and laying limp. I stepped carefully; It was hard to make out all the junk I left on my floor, but it gets easy enough to steer clear after tripping a half a dozen times. I pulled open the black-out curtains and opened the window, allowing the noises outside to get louder and closer. It was a small semblance of comfort.

The light of the outside basked my room aglow. It wouldn’t last long, since it was winter and it felt like I could barely wake up before the sun had dipped out and taken all the warmth of the Earth with it. The window would be my only source of light as I entered my bathroom. Every day, despite the fact that I kept my shower curtain open, I’d pull it to the side and check the one little blindspot, too anxious to keep my back turned to it, especially when I’d splash water on my face and fumble for a cloth to dry off. The moment of vulnerability; It was disgusting. 

Laid in ruin on the tiled floor was my collection of hair dryers and straighteners, the fragile plastic smashed to pieces, framed by bloody footprints I hadn’t bothered to clean. I had broken the appliances days ago, and stepped on them during a late-night trip to the bathroom. Was it smart of me to break them? No,  but I was already on edge after burning myself on the straightener despite it not being on. The hair dryer had whirred to life and the sudden noise just sent me over the edge. I threw them to the ground and just smashed them til the sound died and they just lay there, disgustingly broken. 

The sink water ran, freezing cold, then uncomfortably hot. It fluctuated between the two, but I was just grateful that what came out of the faucet *was* water. 

Washing my face was pretty much the highlight of my day. I hadn’t showered in a few days, since my phone died and I couldn’t use the flashlight to illuminate the bathroom. I contemplated filling up a bucket and just washing myself in the middle of my bedroom, but the busy intersection that my second-floor apartment overlooked made me hyper-aware of just how visible I was. Believe me, I was taken aback more than once by just how clearly you could see into my room. Creeps. 

So I settled for a washcloth with some body wash and just ragged myself down every morning. It wasn’t like anyone was going to see me any time soon.

I walked into the kitchen, where my baby Mocha greeted me. She was an admittedly very chunky brown tabby cat; Don’t worry, when she wasn’t ripping open her food bag, she was on a diet. She let me know how upset she was with her late breakfast with her chorus of pitiful meows and wails. The light coming in from the balcony served as the only illumination for my entire apartment. I normally hated the damn thing, since I was again only on the second floor and the balcony was horrifically ugly, but the little bit of natural light was pleasant in these circumstances.

I portioned out Mocha’s food carefully and refreshed her waters. Her matching bowls sat in the middle of the room, between the kitchen and living room, far away from any wall. I had only accidentally knocked them over once or twice. 

My apartment was a bit chaotic, for lack of a better word. I know how it looks to everyone else. My stove top is covered in duct tape and aluminum foil, the microwave is cracked from severe blunt-force trauma, and every appliance sat on the coffee table, neatly stacked together. All of the wires and plugs had been cut with scissors and braided together. 

It’s not my fault. I’m not crazy. 

Every appliance in my apartment had been unplugged, batteries ripped out, multiple of them broken by my own hands. I was getting desperate; After all, I even popped open the breaker and turned every little switch off. I heard each crackle and pop as the outlets suddenly lost power. I checked it every couple of hours too, confirming that yes, indeed, every outlet and source of energy that could run to my apartment was off. 

Yes, I was freezing. It doesn’t matter. 

Desperate times called for desperate measures. 

The whole situation started about a week ago. I had awoken as usual, turned on my lap as usual, unplugged my phone and responded to the flurry of notifications I had, as usual. Brushed my teeth, washed my face, and my blow dryer sat in my little bathroom caddy that I used to store all my hair products after I washed and blow dried my hair the night before.

I fed Mocha where her food and water bowl rested against a closed ventilation door, next to an outlet, and refreshed her water with the fancy brita water from the fridge, and went to make myself coffee; All as usual. 

It was so usual, in fact, that my brain apparently decided to skip the necessary steps that go into making coffee. I hadn’t noticed that there wasn’t any water, nor coffee grounds, in the pot and just stuck my mug under it and pressed the button all haughtily, like there would never be a world in which I didn’t get my morning coffee. 

I just watched my darling fat ass cat chow down on her food like she had never eaten a single bite of kibble before in her life.

The coffee pot whirred to life behind me. It hummed and sizzled the familiar sounds of boiling water, the mechanisms clicking and pouring. A strange scent filled the air, but still, I didn’t really pay attention. I was tapping away on my phone, half-heartedly watching the dozens of videos my boyfriend sent my on Instagram. I just sat there waiting for the little *ding!* That would spike my stupid monkey-brain’s dopamine and tell me my coffee was ready.

The *ding!* sounded, but the coffee was *not* ready. I turned to face the coffee pot, excited for my daily dose of keeping away the caffeine withdrawals but immediately gagged at the smell. It was like mashed up black licorice dipped in gasoline. I covered my nose, wondering if the coffee maybe burnt? I went to pick up the pot and was surprised at the overwhelming sense of *wrong, wrong, wrong* that flooded me.

I picked it up but God, the coffee pot was *heavy*. Like, extraordinary so, much more than a pot of boiled water should be. I had to grab a dish towel to hold the other side because one hand was simply not enough. I regretted it, because the other hand had previously been pinching my nose shut to protect against the onslaught of horrific smells, but I didn’t want to drop the boiling pot of something on myself, or my kitchen. Who knows if this shit would stain. 

I dragged it across the counter, cringing at the scraping, and almost dropped it in the sink when I tried to lift it to pour it out. I could just barely prop it up and the force of the thick sludge-like substance pouring out made my arms shake. 

It was thick and dark; I had thought it was black but it appeared more greenish-red in the light. It smelled less like gasoline and more just like rot. It’s what I imagine the smell of a dead body would be like. There were small chunks in it too, these weird pieces that looked a bit like raw chicken or that weird paper that you see on the bottom of ground beef in stores. The smell was way too much - I already have a very sensitive nose, and watching it clog up the sink was the breaking point as the bile in the back of my throat raced up and stomach acid and rotting sludge became one in the sink. 

That coffee pot was never getting used again. I could only wipe my mouth as I watched the mess slowly gurgle and drip down the drain. Fuck that shit. And why the fuck did this only start happening after my roommates moved out?

Since then, literally everything in my apartment began falling apart. At first, it was just my touch lamp cycling through all the settings without me touching it and flickering on and off, which I wrote off as it being a lamp I bought off of Temu for seven dollars reaching its end of life after about a year of consistent use. 

The rice cooker that my old roommate left behind which normally sang cute little tunes in Korean and played the sound of a train moving instead started making these weird gurgling sounds. Monotonous gurgling sounds, and not even in the robotic way it did it previously; It sounded like a recording of someone choking. I very aggressively bonked it in hopes of making it stop, because it was already unplugged, but all it did was cycle back to ‘chuga-chuga-choo-choo!’. 

The less annoying but still frustrating occurrences were the fairy lights I strung across the apartment flickering, turning different colors despite the fact that they should only ever be orange lights. My fan would flick on and just rattle incessantly. It constantly sounded like there was something tapping on the vents, dragging long nails across the metal in a way that I associate with nails on chalkboard, scratching the inside of my ears. 

Unplugging everything was annoying and also painful, what with the static electricity from the building cold and the fact that it just seemed electrical currents were attracted to me so much. Dragging out the refrigerator to unplug it was disgusting, both from the sheer amount of dust behind it, and also the fact that underneath was this spot on the floor where the hard wood became soft, like wet cardboard. It was sticky and black and I decided that I was not going to touch it, lest I come away with some sort of awful disease never before seen, or worse, the floor caved in.

I also had to move Mocha’s food bowls because that outlet I mentioned earlier? Yeah, it started leaking like, pus. Yellowish-orange pus. I was very nervous that Mocha, in her empty-brained search for food, would lick it, or if it got on her food, she wouldn’t notice and would eat it anyways. Truthfully, her food bowls probably shouldn’t have been underneath the outlet anyways. 

I took all the perishables out of the fridge and threw most of them in a pot. Very grateful my stove was gas, because I didn’t want to deal with trying to figure out which switch in the breaker I had to flick back on. I contemplated cleaning the fridge but just decided to take out all the junk I wouldn’t be able to do anything with before it rotted or molded. 

The soup cooked, a surprisingly pleasant smell filling the apartment. I spent a good bit of the day cracking open windows and trying to air out the disgusting scent that radiated in my apartment. I was a little surprised that no neighbors had filed a complaint, but I’d find out why later. It was getting late when the soup finally finished. I wasn’t following a recipe, just let it simmer til I thought it probably wouldn’t kill me and chowed down. Since then, I’ve really only eaten sliced bread with little packets of honey I stole from McDonald’s and a mostly empty peanut butter jar. The soup was good, minus the sheer amount of garlic I threw in there. I should’ve stopped after the four cloves but I didn’t know if jarlic went bad and I wasn’t letting six dollars go to waste. Not in this economy. 

At least there was no reason for my building to overcharge me for utilities this month. I tried texting my friends and mostly my boyfriend, but not a single message of mine went through. Instagram, Discord, messaging, I even tried emailing. Error after error message. It’s fine; I would just go to his apartment later. He only lived a few floors above me.

I tossed my bowl in the sink and immediately cringed when the disposal whirred to life. I hate the fucking disposal. It spewed out bits of sludge from the morning and the smell mixed with the fresh smell of food and any satisfaction I felt after eating left me immediately. Dinner was coming back up almost immediately. I only barely managed to keep it down, though I definitely did not feel good about it. I set about finding the cover for the disposal when the smell of gas pricked my nose. 

The burners were on. The clicking of the gas tickled my ears. The flame hadn’t catched. I rushed over and turned off the burners. The second that one turned off, another would click back on. It was like a fucked up game of whack-a-mole, me twisting each dial to 0 just for another one to ‘click, click, click’. 

“Stop that,” I demanded, reaching out to hold two dials at 0 as I glared at the other two dials. I did not want to deal with this. Fortunately, the other two dials did not move. I removed my hands and stepped away slowly. They didn’t move. Vaguely, the thought of them turning on while I slept hummed in the back of my mind, but it wasn’t like I could do anything about it, short of cutting the gas lines which, with my limited knowledge of pretty much everything, didn’t seem like a good idea. I already wasn’t getting my deposit back. 

I thought about seeing my boyfriend, telling him about the weird shit going on in my apartment. He was just upstairs, a minute ride in an elevator. I glanced at Mocha. Maybe I should take her with me. She had zero survival instincts, given that she was just sleeping on the couch during my battle with the stove top. I slipped on my shoes and picked her up, heaving at her chunkiness, and went to leave.

Except I couldn’t. So if that answered your question of why I haven’t just left yet, that would be why. I checked the lock multiple times, jingled the doorknob. We had switched to electric key fobs a while ago, so maybe it was just a glitch? I set Mocha down and opened my phone to see if there was any notification about a building issue with the doors.



Nothing. 



I tried again. The door knob didn’t even budge. I glanced through the peephole just in time to see a couple girls walk by the door.

“Hey!” I called out, hoping they’d hear me. They were laughing and apparently did not hear me as they walked past my door. I banged on the door, hoping that would alert them, but to no avail. 

“What the fuck man,” I whined. For all that I had been treating the day like every thing was a mild inconvenience, I was fucking *stressed*. I had classes to go to, medication to pick up, people to talk to, and now, a very big hole in my wallet labeled ‘*replace all the shit you broke’.* Not exactly the best for a college student with no job just barely getting by on stipends. 

I turned to go to the balcony. The balconies on the second floor are all connected, only divided by a three foot wall in between. In other words, it’d be incredibly easy to hop and knock on some poor bastard’s balcony, jumpscare style. But of course, that wasn’t an option either because the balcony door, which me and my old roommates previously lamented over the fact had no lock, didn’t fucking budge either. Okay, cool. Great. That’s fine. 

No, it wasn’t fine. The unmedicated anxiety rolling through me because, yes, by needing to pick up my medication I meant I was days behind taking them, was unbidden and overwhelming and against my will I began to hyperventilate. I sat down on the cold floor, and glanced around my destroyed apartment with tear-blurred eyes. Why the fuck was this happening to me? Was I going crazy? Upgraded my concoction of mental illness to full blown psychosis? 

I sobbed on the living room floor for a long time. Mocha sat on the couch staring at me - She wasn’t a very good emotional support animal, but she was cute at the very least. I barely had anything in my stomach to throw up so the dry-heaving led to nowhere except a dry and sore throat. It was dark in the apartment. I was exhausted. I stood up wobbly, feeling like my legs were going to give out at any minute. I tried, once more, to open the balcony door. Nothing. I went to the front door and tried there too. Nothing. I felt like I was going to cry again, but my eyes were dry. 

I just wanted to sleep. 

I picked Mocha up, who squirmed a bit in my arms before I plopped her down on my bed. I used the little bit of battery on my phone as a flashlight for me to go to the bathroom and brush my teeth, before I tucked myself in bed and subsequently passed out.

And that’s how my days have been. Every day I check the front and back door. I even got desperate enough to try and open the windows, but they were suicide-prevention windows which was fucking ridiculous because I literally have a balcony and am also only on the second floor, and the windows didn’t open enough for me to even stick my arm through, let alone my whole body. 

I did try to scream for help a few times, but it didn’t seem like anyone heard me. Either that or living in a city is even worse than imaginable and not a single damn person gave me a second thought. I don’t know which is worse. 

My usual breakfast (and lunch and dinner) of bread was soiled by the fact that the slices were beginning to mold. I contemplated eating around it, but I wasn’t really in a position to get sick. 

The worst part is no one’s come to check on me; Not even my boyfriend. Every now and then I thought I’d hear a knock at the door, but when I ran and checked, there was nothing, no one in the hallway. My phone died a while ago, so I had no way of checking if anyone’s called or texted me. The rational part of me figured that no one came because they literally couldn’t, or that there was something that just removed me from the outside world, but the irrational part of me thought maybe everyone was just grateful I wasn’t bugging them anymore. 

Meanwhile, everything was slowly getting worse. I would lay in bed listlessly, unable to read in the dark or draw, unable to open my phone or laptop, just left to stare at the ceiling. I kept my phone plugged in constantly in hopes that during one of the ‘surges’ as I had taken to calling them would happen long enough for my phone to get some charge, but it never did. The screen would flash like it was about to turn on, just to go black immediately. 

My drawers would slam open, the insides rattling, before slamming shut again. Cabinets would slam; A few of the doors actually fell off and my plates and cups would fly out. Luckily, most of them were plastic, but my favorite mugs and a few glass containers shattered upon impact. There’s no sugarcoating; In between the fear of the loud noises and seeing some of my favorite mugs shatter, I cried. 

I spent a lot of time just mourning. I’m 19. I moved out two years ago to go to college. I’m still dependent on my parents, but I spend almost all my time looking for jobs in my field or doing work. I lost most of my friends and the few I have, live hours away. I’m homesick constantly, and the worst thing is everyone keeps saying it’ll get better. But right now, I feel like there’s only a deep, dark descent that I’m incapable of climbing out of; And I’m painfully lonely through the whole terrible ride down. 

*Surely there’s others more deserving of this shit than me,* I thought as the rod my curtains hung off of ripped off the wall, taking off the plaster and paint. I glanced at the wall where the photos of me and my boyfriend hung up, next to a dried bouquet of flowers he had gotten me. Surely I was loved, right? 

There was an echoing sound of more glass shattering in the kitchen. 

I sighed, staring back at the ceiling. If it collapsed on me right now, it’d just be doing me a favor. I barely walked, my right foot sore and bruised from the cuts on it, the leftovers of stepping on broken plastic. My left foot was sore from trying to clean the shattered glass from earlier. I didn’t want Mocha to step on it, but all of my shoes had gone missing and it’s not exactly easy cleaning up glass in the dark. I couldn’t even sit down to remove most of the shards of glass, so if I even flexed my foot, sharp spikes of pain would radiate up my leg. 

Mocha laid next to me, quiet as she slept. I could feel her rise and fall with her breath. At least she was doing okay. She got freaked out by the loud noises and flashes, but she would just hide under my comforters and eventually fall asleep, oblivious to the mental and physical agony I was in. 

I laid there and let my sore, tired eyes close as I willed myself to fall asleep against the whirring sounds of unplugged appliances going crazy. My head went fuzzy and slowly, sleep came to me.

Chapter 17: After the Battle, Before the Truth

The street smelled like ozone and rain that had never fallen.

Emergency lights painted everything red and blue, but they felt distant—like reflections in glass. The world had resumed moving, but only because it didn’t know how to stop.

Lynn sat on the curb.

Her coat was scorched at the edges, the fabric smoking faintly, but she hadn’t changed back into anything else. She hadn’t bothered fixing her hair. For the first time since Arai had met her, she looked… tired.

Not injured.

Tired.

Arai stood a few steps away, hands shaking, unsure whether he was allowed to get closer.

“…You okay?” he asked, stupidly.

She nodded once. “Yes.”

Then, after a pause, “No.”

That answer scared him more.


---

Authorities had cordoned off the area, but none of them approached her.

Not the police.

Not the soldiers.

Not the men in suits who spoke quietly into sleeves and watched her like she might blink and erase them.

An unspoken agreement had formed:

Do not rush the girl who fought the sky.


---

Arai broke the silence first.

“You knew,” he said. “Back then. When you said the world would notice back.”

Lynn stared at the cracked asphalt between her boots.

“Yes.”

“You knew something like that would come.”

“Yes.”

He swallowed.

“…Why didn’t you stop it sooner?”

Her fingers tightened against her coat.

“Because,” she said carefully, “if I had, you wouldn’t have believed me.”

He flinched.

“That’s not fair.”

“I know.”

She looked up at him then—really looked.

“But it’s true.”


---

Ambulances moved in the distance. Reporters shouted questions no one answered.

Above them, drones hovered, keeping their distance like nervous birds.

Lynn leaned back, resting her palms on the ground.

“After a certain point,” she said, “power stops being about what you can do. It becomes about what you must allow others to see.”

Arai rubbed his face.

“You let people get hurt.”

She closed her eyes.

“No,” she said softly. “I let people be afraid.”

That distinction mattered to her.


---

Minutes passed.

Or hours.

Time felt… unimportant.

Eventually, Arai sat down beside her, leaving just enough space to retreat if needed.

“…Are there more?” he asked.

“Yes.”

“How many?”

She hesitated.

“Enough.”

That was not an answer.

It was worse.


---

Arai laughed suddenly—short, broken.

“You know,” he said, staring at the empty sky, “this morning I was worried about my presentation.”

Lynn smiled faintly.

“I remember.”

“I spilled coffee on my notes. Thought it was the worst thing that could happen today.”

She hummed.

“Perspective is cruel like that.”

He glanced at her.

“Are you… still you?”

The question hung between them, fragile.

Lynn didn’t answer right away.

Instead, she reached into her coat and pulled out the small, battered notebook Arai had once teased her about.

She flipped it open.

Inside were not spells.

Not diagrams.

Just notes.

Music fragments.

Doodles.

Bad jokes written in the margins.

She handed it to him.

“I wrote that on the train,” she said. “The day we met.”

He took it slowly.

“…You’ve been carrying this the whole time?”

“Yes.”

“Why?”

Her voice was barely above a whisper.

“Because if I stopped being me, I was afraid I wouldn’t notice.”


---

Arai handed it back.

His hands were steadier now.

“You saved everyone,” he said.

She shook her head.

“I defended them.”

“That’s the same thing.”

“It isn’t,” she replied. “Saving implies permanence.”

He frowned.

“…So what happens now?”

Lynn looked toward the perimeter, where a familiar figure waited.

A woman in a neutral suit.

Calm posture.

Eyes that didn’t waver.

“They’re going to ask for the truth,” Lynn said.

“And?”

“And I will give it,” she replied.

“Not all of it.”

Arai exhaled slowly.

“Should I stay?”

She turned to him.

For a moment, the power, the presence, the impossibility—all of it faded.

She was just Lynn again.

“I would like that,” she said.


---

Across the city, in rooms with no windows, people reviewed footage frame by frame.

They slowed it down.

Enhanced it.

Measured it.

They didn’t cheer.

They didn’t panic.

They wrote new protocols.

New definitions.

New fears.

One analyst paused the footage on a single frame:

Lynn standing alone beneath the broken sky.

Small.

Defiant.

Unmistakably human.

“…She didn’t hesitate,” he murmured.

“No,” his superior replied. “She chose.”


---

Far beyond Earth, something else recorded the loss of a unit.

A recalculation.

A shift.

The anomaly had teeth.

And it cared.


---

The truth was coming.

But not yet.

Not tonight.

Tonight was for silence.

For breathing.

For deciding what parts of yourself you could still afford to keep.

1qhzm1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bedbugs/comments/1qhzm1i/did_i_beat_my_bed_bug_problem/,Did I beat my bed bug problem?,"This is a long story, so lock in as I regale you with a tale of psychological warfare, 2 couches, and an enemy the size of an apple seed.

In Aug of 2023, I started getting bites. I got around 5 bites total before I identified the problem and started taking action. My skin reacts really badly to bites and I get bigger welts than others when compared with pictures, so I wasn’t entirely sure what was causing the itchy red bumps, but I caught a little brown bug crawling on me while I was sitting on my couch early on, and that solidified for me that it was bed bugs (100% identified). I’m unsure of where they came from, but I suspect maybe it was a stowaway from public transportation, or maybe one hitched a ride on my boyfriend who was traveling a lot for work and would fling his luggage on the couch when he came home.

From there, I isolated my couch and stopped sitting on it entirely. The bugs never made it to my bed or anywhere else, and I would definitely have known if they had because of the way I react to bites. I rent, and I did not want to tell my landlord if the problem was small and isolated, because where I live, the cost of treatment falls on the tenant and I was a broke college student. Instead, I bought bedbug detecting tools: sticky paper, lures, and these little slippery dishes that go under the couch legs. I just wanted to know the scope of the problem before pushing the big red button and paying for fumigation, and also wanted to prevent them from migrating elsewhere in the apartment. I also vacuumed the couch very frequently. I never saw another bug… not for a while at least.

6 months went by where I did not sit on my couch, and I didn’t get a bite. I felt like the problem took care of itself. I started sitting on my couch again and within a week, 1-2 more bites appeared. I took the couch to the dump.

I was couchless for another 5-6 months, and that felt pretty bad, because at that point, I was afraid of my living room. I live in a very small apartment and being relegated to the one room I had left, my bedroom, for eating, for watching TV, etc. became extremely depressing.

By Aug of 2024, I had saved up for another couch. I really wanted to be able to enjoy my living room again. I thought the old couch was the root of the problem, and it had been a year, so I figured getting a new couch would be fine. Friends, it was not. A month later in September, I felt an itchy bump on my arm. Just one. For the record, my small 8x10 living room consisted of a couch and area rug. I did not get rid of the old rug. After that, I felt retraumatized and stopped sitting on my new couch. I took all the same actions as before: monitoring. The living room sat unused, as I sat at my bedroom desk, slurping Buldak night after night, again.

I didn’t want to throw away my new couch and I was conflicted about what to do going forward. The torment of having this invisible threat living so close, yet so far, for SO LONG, clouded my mind, and I sat in freeze mode. I decided I should get rid of the old rug, and find a way to keep the couch. But I still wanted proof of the problem. I vacuumed the hell out of the couch regularly. Christmas Day, 2024, sitting on the toilet with the door open because I’m classy af, I see a bug crawling from the living room rug towards me. I capture it and it’s a bedbug.

I kind of sprung into action. Freeze mode deactivated and I was ready to try one more thing. I got rid of the rug, cleaned the hell out of the living room furniture (coffee table and tv stand), pulled everything from the baseboards, and sprinkled diatomaceous earth. I bought a bedbug proof mattress cover that would fit over my couch and covered it, then covered it with a tight fitting couch cover. 

I still stayed away from my living room for 4 months after that. I experimented by sitting for an hour, two hours, here and there. Since Sept of 2025, I have been finally fully enjoying my living room and have not been bitten again. I’m sure in large part thanks to the bedbug proof mattress cover. I was really strict about blankets touching the floor while sitting on the couch, but that’s been hard to enforce because my boyfriend doesn’t really care that much so I’ve kind of given up. Still, no bites.

It’s been 1 year and 4 months since I’ve had a bite, and just over 1 year since I’ve seen a bug.

My question is: how safe am I? I don’t think I’ll ever take the mattress cover off. Do you think some bugs are still alive inside? I don’t think the problem was ever that huge to begin with. Maybe starting with 1-2 bugs that grew into a small colony. I know I could have dealt with this a lot faster if I had just paid for fumigation at the first sighting, but I didn’t think 1 bug was enough proof, and they didn’t migrate anywhere else. Did I get rid of my problem?

TL;DR: I fought a tiny, localized bed bug problem for more than 2 years, avoided my own living room like it was cursed, threw out furniture, and eventually solved it… hopefully? But unsure and still paranoid.",1,1768911546.0,Bedbugs,1,1.0,False
1qhzlxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_Programmers/comments/1qhzlxn/adhd_life_hacks_that_sounds_ridiculous_but/,ADHD 'life hacks' that sounds ridiculous but actually changed everything?,"Just really intrigued to know what people have put in place for themselves to function well with ADHD. Systems, processes, rules, routines, etc. that you've managed to make a habit and that make life a bit easier? Here is my list

* I keep duplicates of EVERYTHING. Three phone chargers (bedroom, living room, car), two sets of keys, backup deodorant in my desk drawer. Yes it's expensive upfront, but the time and stress I save not hunting for things? Worth every penny.
* My medication lives IN my breakfast cupboard, right next to the cereal. Can't forget to take it if it's literally blocking the food I want. Same logic for vitamins in the coffee station.
* I have a 'launching pad' by my front door - a specific basket for my wallet, keys, sunglasses, and work badge. The rule is: it MUST go there immediately when I come home, even if I'm carrying groceries or dying to pee. No exceptions. It's the only way.
* Color-coded everything. My calendar isn't just organized by type of event - work is blue, personal is green, medical is red - but I also have color-coded laundry baskets (whites, darks, colors) because apparently that's the only way my brain will actually sort clothes.
* I set alarms for the PROCESS, not the event. So if I need to leave at 2pm, I have alarms at 1pm (start getting ready), 1:30pm (shoes on), 1:45pm (gather items), and 1:55pm (walk to car). Just one alarm for '2pm leave' never worked.
* Honestly, those 'doom piles'? Yeah, I have those too... but I call them 'visual to do lists' and honestly, that reframe helps. Out of sight IS out of mind, so my winter coat has been on the dining chair for three weeks now because I need to get it dry cleaned and if I put it away I'll forget.
* Here's the game-changer though: I realized that no matter what routine I build, my ADHD brain will eventually get bored and sabotage it. So I started using 'anchor activities' paired with rotating novelty. The anchor stays the same (like brushing teeth) but what comes before or after rotates to keep things interesting. Some days it's followed by skincare, some days stretching, some days journaling. I've been tracking this with the Soothfy app and it's actually the first habit system that's stuck because it works WITH my brain's need for variety instead of fighting against it.
* I take photos of EVERYTHING. Where I parked my car, what shelf I saw that thing I might want to buy later, my parking meter time, the settings on appliances before I move them. My camera roll is chaos but it saves me constantly.
* Body doubling via video call with my sister. We don't even talk much - we just both do our boring tasks 'together' on video. Something about another human existing in my space makes me actually do the dishes.
* And honestly? Working with my therapist has been huge. She's actually the one who pushed me to get assessed in the first place, and now we set one concrete task between sessions. That external accountability is everything, especially for the one-off admin nightmares like renewing my driver's license. We also learned I need tasks broken down into ridiculous detail - it can't be 'file taxes,' it needs to be: 'log into tax software, locate last year's return, find T4 in email, locate that other tax slip from the bank, input numbers from first form, input numbers from second form...' etc. Otherwise my brain sees it as one HUGE overwhelming thing and just... nopes out.
* I keep a 'body needs' checklist on my phone that I check when I'm feeling weird/irritable: Have I eaten? Drunk water? Taken meds? Slept enough? Moved my body? 90% of my 'moods' are actually just basic needs I forgot about.
* The 'two-minute rule' but make it ADHD: if something takes less than two minutes AND I'm already standing up, I do it immediately. Already up getting water? Take the empty glass back to the kitchen. Walking past the bathroom? Grab that towel off the floor. It's the only way things get done around here.

It reminds me how good I have it. I feel a sense of guilt for being human, even though I can’t help how cold it is, or how an animal can have such a bad reputation. People are always proving how stupid they are when they make it hard on wolves and coyotes. 

What do I know? I’ve never seen a dead cow and known whether it was from predation or poaching livestock. Only seen one dead cow. Couldn’t tell what killed it because most of it was gone. It had also been burned. I thought it was a stump that had been struck by lightning.

Who would leave a burnt cow carcass out in the middle of a field?

You can hear everything in the dark quiet of the morning. Each dog barking is like a sentry guarding a perimeter. “HEY! HEY! HEY!”

Cats and coyotes stealthily making their way through alleyways and backyards. Will they disturb a flower bed? Knock over a trash can?

But then, and because I feel the cold air cascading down from the open window, I am wondering if these are dogs that are being let out to pee, or if they spend the night outside.

Who would leave their dog out in the cold?

Maybe I don’t have enough on my plate and I have to get sentimental about cold dogs and coyotes.

To be totally honest seeing the level of turmoil the JB Buddy database is in right now has given me I guess decision fatigue and I've spent the last week thinking about what to do and where to start but not actually doing anything.

Because of my time off over the holidays the build up of dead links, new products to add for existing categories as well as new headaches with getting data I've been a bit stuck.

I have a feeling some people assume the whole thing is automated and some things are but unfortunately because of stores like Harvey Norman, Joyce Mayne and Bing Lee there are added complexities that require oversight.

There's issues with URLs changing, model numbers not matching or being made-up which requires manual data entry and comparisons to get everything in check. New products get added which restarts the data entry process. There are products/lines/brands exclusive to one store which need to be ignored or filtered out.

There's a lot to do.

it's at a point now where it seems like the amount of work built-up is like starting from scratch again.

I also didn't start the project with the intent to make anything off it but the amount of work and I mean work without an income is a challenge. We don't have a genuine offer right now for the ad spot since the last two advertisers and I'm not surprised. The quality has slipped, which means people leave the site unhappy and don't come back and the views begin to shrink.

Thank you to all of you who support me, give feedback and say nice things and especially a massive thanks to those who bought me a coffee over the last few months.

I guess I'll end this woe is me rant with saying I'm not giving up but unfortunately I need to do what will restore the site which is the boring grind part and fire extinguishing and making sure the core aspect of the site, its whole purpose is functioning. Let me get it back to it's good state and we'll build from there.

By the way, it's not like completely fucked or anything there just may be times where you click a link to see the price on the retailers website but they don't stock it anymore. The stuff with working links is still getting updated multiple times a day. There may also be times where there is only 1 store showing for a product or you may see a product on a retailer, search jb buddy and we have no results despite it being a category we track.

# Setting things Right

The next morning, I winced as I shuffled out of bed. There were a few feelings of latent hostility around the breakfast table as Jacqueline swiped my morning breakfast with a staredown.

*I don’t have time for this.*

Even if breakfast was important, I needed to focus on my omni-pad, which had a map of the state. I kept trying out the different crossing points with two fingers, letting it draw the map as I pinched various points that looked close together on the flattened image.

“Not going to dress like a freak today?”

No one else bustling around or at the kitchen table said anything. Not even my mother, whose love of the Shil’vati I knew all too well, she didn’t look either of us in the eyes, ever so quick to shoulder her purse and make haste.

“Saving that for later,” I answered honestly. “When are you leaving, again?”

“Soon.”

“Funny, me too.”

I had something to check on- I couldn’t take the time to visit a base as Emperor with no cards in my deck. A night’s rest had given me the insight that while I might have my suspicions of Gavin and Sullivan, if it was the case then wandering around empty-handed was a great way to be on that ‘temporary assignment’, *permanently.*

Still no contact from either Radio or G-Man. Short of raising an emergency signal, I had no way to summon them. And if I did that, then there’d be no walking it back. It’d be a mission abort over my own paranoia that Gavin and Sullivan were taking me out of the picture by sending me to Vanguard.

Sure, the CIA supposedly tended to do that whenever rebel leaders stopped moving in whatever direction they approved of, but I had no proof. And I’d grown increasingly reliant on them just to keep the vast, interstate network of cells in communication, armed, and supplied. Them, and their selection of officers, logisticians, smugglers, and grey-book accountants. The effects would be devastating if I was wrong.

I needed people of my own. People I knew I could trust, and who had an ax to grind with the shil’vati. That was a shockingly short list these days.

It hadn’t taken more than firing up the old Talay school omni-pad that they’d ‘forgotten’ to collect back off us all to dial up Nate, and to my surprise he was willing to have me as a visitor.

*****

“You okay?” Nate asked, and I stopped pacing back and forth on the front lawn. I still hadn’t decided the best way to broach this, but Nate seemed unwilling to step away from his front door.

“Still hopped up on adrenaline. A walk would help smooth it out.”

“What from?” He finally took a couple steps away from his door. I slowly led him along, slowly walking backward until he fell in alongside me.

“My sister tried to pick a fight with me. She got a few good hits in, but things have changed since she was here last.” That was a lot longer ago, but I wasn’t about to go fishing for whether he’d be worth recruiting.

“What?”

“Siblings, you know?”

He laughed the same as he used to, then admitted: “Actually, no, I have no idea.”

“Oh, only child? Well, anyway, on the subject, we’ve never actually talked about what happened.”

“I figured they would have briefed you, filled you in. Mistaken identity.”

“Yeah,” I said, drawing the word out, recalling quickly the framing they’d given me, and making sure to not let on just how much I knew. Worried both about the time I was due at the Raktens and that I’d let something slip, I tried to deflect.

“How have you been feeling?”

“Uh, fine?” He asked. “Like, I’m not sick or anything. All healed up from…” he trailed off and looked away.

Vaughn and G-Man had approached me initially for recruitment, and those were the only first-contacts I’d had as Elias, not counting Larry and Verns after G-Man had gone and gotten them. Everyone else I’d ever personally recruited, I’d done so as Emperor, and only after they had already expressed an interest in joining the movement, usually to Vaughn. How had he gone about sussing that out, and then teasing out any interest from them?

How could I do that?

‘Have you ever had any latent feelings of anger? You know, over what happened?’ Was *way* too on the nose.

“What were they even thinking?”

His smile looked perfectly natural, if not for the context of our conversation. Now I saw it as a mask of sorts, and that gave me a spark of hope. “No idea.”

“What? None?” I asked.

“Mistaken identity, right? Besides, I’m not mad or anything. The payout was…” he waved a hand. I had to take his word for it, I had never been to his place before, but I guessed this house was nice, sort of. Definitely ‘large’ big windows and a three car garage. I wasn’t sure why, but it felt soulless in the pre-invasion style. Maybe it was the lack of color, or arrangement, or lack of any trees in the yard.

“If that’s what makes you happy,” I mumbled.

“I wouldn’t say ‘happy,’ he actually sounded short. And just like that, the mask was back in place, his eyes searching mine. “Why do you ask?”

“No reason. Just trying to see what you thought about it all.” *Yeah, let’s just reminisce about the good times, like when you lost a few teeth and had your face reconstructed.* “I mean, it was a pretty serious mistake.”

“Dunno.”

“Dunno?” I asked. “Come on. You’re- we’re-” I slapped my sides and then sighed.

I needed people I could trust, but I also had to finally admit no idea how to recruit. Vaughn had done a wonderful job of finding dissatisfied people and slipping them some vague notion of violence or joining. He had the perfect touch for it. I could obviously instill it in people as Emperor. What was the point of subtlety if I was wearing a mask? Then I could speak and act completely freely. Anonymity was essential, but at a certain point a real-person-connection had to be made. There lay the vulnerability.

“Hm. You look like you got over it, somehow.”

“I won’t say I’ve dwelled on it much,” I admitted freely.

“Therapy supposedly helps, but…” he glanced at the basketball hoop. “My shoulder still hurts sometimes, and it throws off my aim. Scans say the pain isn’t actually real, and that it’ll go away on its own any day now. I’m still waiting.”

“Sometimes,” I said quietly, pausing until Nate stepped closer. “Sometimes the best way is to do what you think you have to, in order to make your peace on your own terms. All the walks and talks in the world won’t make things better once you’ve identified the problem. You have to actually do something to solve it.”

“I’ve been trying therapy.”

“I was in therapy at Talay, you know. Before everything, I mean. Before Natalie even got there.”

“Yeah? Do you think it helped?”

Ultimately, what did it amount to? Less than nothing. I’d never intentionally spoken an honest word, lest I give myself away to the tender mercies of the Shil’vati-run state. I wasn’t even going to St. Michael’s, meaning the time spent was basically wasted. Once I’d learned about the destruction of our books, our culture, our way of life, only one thing had worked to calm me.

“No. No, I don’t think it helped even a tiny bit.”

“Then what did?”

“Nothing I can admit to,” I said. For a brief moment, my entire alter-life flashed before my eyes. Every sensation, from a sparring punch landing on Vaughn, to the pressure wave bowling me over. The roar of the crowd in the now-named Myrrah Square, the first time I’d felt the savage kick of a railgun. The quiet words of advice all bleeding together distilled in a quarter second’s whisper of the wind through the summer leaves. “I have to get going soon. If ever you do feel like it’s not working out for you, just seek alternate paths. Find a resolution you can accept, and then accept it within yourself as necessary.”

“Alternate paths?”

“Yeah. If and when you’re ready. There’s a place I know, and people there who might help. I’ve got to get rolling, though.” I walked back to my bike and threw my leg over. “But it’s good to see you, either way.”

“You too.” The response was likely automatic, and he looked troubled.

In a way, I felt sorry for him.

He’d climbed as high as anyone at Talay could. Valedictorian. Kicked my ass on the State Test. Captain of the Basketball team. Popular. Where’d it get him? Where’d it leave him? I cast a backward glance at the house as he closed the front door.

None of those achievements had protected him. If anything, they’d endangered him and put him on Goshen’s radar as a more likely candidate for *Top Insurgent at Talay.* And he plainly wasn’t happy, despite his earlier words. That nagging injury was, I had a feeling, just scratching the surface.

The system failed when he’d adhered to it perfectly. Do he really think clinging to it even tighter was going to save him the next time something like this happened? Or would he accept that it was time to abandon ship, in pursuit of something different?

Only time would tell.

# [A Legitimate Strategy](https://youtu.be/Oon8S8u-33c)

Under the summer sun, we’d been given our kit and told the scenario in full: Two survivors of a pod, trying to work our way to the rendezvous/evac point in time.

This was probably something Morsh herself had gone through. Small-scale battles no one would sing praises of or go down in official records. Deployments without IFFs on either side. Anything worth fighting dirty over presumably had a breathable atmosphere, semi-potable water.

Thus informed and equipped we’d made our way down the hill they lived on, toward the Brandywine river, and started following it down toward Wilmington. It wasn’t that long before Natalie called for a break.

Going by my mental map, it was just as well. It wouldn’t be long before we faced a decision of whether to continue following the river toward Wilmington, or try going around it through the abandoned neighborhoods, where we might attempt the crossing north of the city.

I broke out our equipment and tools on top of the map just to give them a second glance and weigh all our options.

We had some sort of carving tool I didn’t understand. A standard-issue shil’vati combat knife. Emergency flare and omni-pad to record our daily progress. Thermal blankets in a camouflage pattern that did not blend in particularly well with the summer vegetation. A water purifier to attach to the flasks on our hips which could be used on a refill, and a flashlight.

We also had a very basic first aid kit that could only perform minor miracles at stemming bleeding, at least compared to the ones I’d grown up with. There was also a gel I was informed was a kind of epoxy, though I wasn’t sure what it was intended to be used for. Possibly suturing? Jamming shut sucking chest wounds?

Natalie said it was for ‘if the guns’ pins stopped sealing,’ which I vaguely recalled from yesterday.

Then there was the other stuff. The omni-pad with an emergency call function, which we were to employ the moment there might be danger or a confrontation with ‘the locals.’

“What are you thinking?”

“We’re at a decision point, and even if we make the decision now, we’ll need to make camp soon.”

She looked around the flat embankment. “Here?”

“It’s along an old foot path, off the road, under tree cover. If she finds us here, she’ll find us no matter where else we pick that we can get to in the daylight we have left. I’d rather use the time to settle up a little shelter, try and rustle up some dinner, and plan.”

A small grin crept up the corners of her face.

“I finally get to be involved in one of your plans?”

I stared at her. “Just yesterday, I brought you in on my plan to go up to the Academy, steal any military or technological secrets I can get my hands on, and then bring them back down to earth.” *I, Prometheus, bring fire to man.* “You’re as involved as it gets.”

“I feel bad for Morsh. She has no idea what she’s in for.” Natalie seemed practically exuberant. “Now, what are we doing?”

Half-remembered passages from *Hatchet* sprang to mind, and I looked over at her. “Sun’s going down in a few hours. Start gathering wood. I need sticks. Tall and long ones. We’re settling by the river.” It worked as clean drinking water, washing water.

“What are you looking for?” Natalie asked as I surveyed the branches and sticks we’d gathered.

It bothered me on some level that I could identify a dozen dead clothing and luxury brands that no longer meaningfully existed, but more than half of the wood I’d helped gather into a pile in front of me had to be categorized by vibes and guesswork. I knew Pine dried out the fastest and could identify it, at least, but none was around.

“I don’t know.” I hated saying those words. They felt like an admission of helplessness.

“Can’t you make a bow?” Natalie asked, dropping the new sticks she had gathered. “I was going to try and see if some of the straighter twigs can be turned into arrows. Do you think you can find a feather somewhere?”

I just stared, and tried to think of what I’d need to even make *that* happen.

“-No.”

“No?” She seemed surprised.

Instantly I was taken back to elementary school, reading *Hatchet.*

If I got lucky I could *maybe* find some trash wire or good string. What on earth kind of wood would be bendable to where it’d snap back and launch an arrow faster than I might throw a spear, without snapping first? Of course, it’d  have to be carved out of the right wood piece, from the right wood. What was it, again? Yew? I had no idea where I’d even find a Yew. Even if I found one, it’d need to be treated, too, with materials I didn’t-

“No,” I said again, this time with more finality.

Natalie stared, almost shocked. “But aren’t you like, you know, all connected to the Earth? Where’s that resourcefulness?” She seemed almost disappointed.

I stared for a few seconds more.

A spear or dart wasn’t a terrible idea, though, especially if I could find something sharp to tip it with. Maybe I could get an [Atlatl](https://media.invisioncic.com/r268468/monthly_2020_05/hafted-about-build-j-johnson-med.jpg.8862a35b2650d347c0ee90fa95d26da6.jpg) going. *Maybe.*

Then again, two teens- an alien and a boy, seen walking down a river was one thing. If one of them had a homemade spear, well, someone might call the Police, and then it was *Mission Fail.*

There was a glint of something that caught the light, and I looked up to the tree where I’d seen it.

“I think I see something we can use.”

Natalie stared with wide eyes as I ran up to the tree, kicked off its trunk and caught the branch. I started doing pull-ups in sync with the branch’s swaying, working my way away from the trunk.

“Catch it, catch it,” I gestured with my chin, and though it took a few seconds for her to understand and then a couple of tries, she snagged the branch when it came low and held it fast for me while I dropped down. I cut loose a few of the twigs that had been out of reach, until at last I could claim my prize.

“Isn’t this cheating?” She asked while I started pulling apart the knotted fishing line, complete with hook, bob, and lead sinker.

“The purpose of this is to simulate. So, we’re simulating. We’re in the field of a hostile alien planet, behind enemy lines. In real life, we’d find corpses with charge packs, meal kits, and more. Finding abandoned enemy equipment is part of the exercise, because it’s what would happen in real life.”

 

“What if we don’t come across ‘dead soldiers’, though, in real life? Or what if they’re booby trapped?”

“Well, it’s a good thing this one wasn't,” I grumbled, cutting one of the knots and pulling its ends through. Without a spool, most of it could be put to other purposes. A very simple rod, bob, lead weight and string didn’t need nearly so much line. I tied the longest section around one of the thinner midsize sticks, and put it between my legs while I kept working.

I handed the prize off to her, and then took a few seconds more with a digging tool to produce a wiggling earthworm. “Sorry,” I apologized to him before skewering the slimy, wiggly little guy and handing the whole setup to Natalie, who stared for a few seconds before accepting it.

While she walked down to the river, I started examining what she’d gathered so far.

An hour of using Natalie as a gofer, sending her out for more wood, stones. More of *everything*, really, and we finally had a lean-to, finally using some of the excess line.

“All done?” She asked, coming back up from the water.

“Very ‘meth addict in the woods’,” I muttered, examining my hasty handiwork. The lean-to was made of a mix of fallen branches, vines, and even a plank of half-rotten plywood, with the trunk forming the main far-end support.

It didn’t look anything like I’d hoped, but it didn’t fall down, not even when I’d given it a good shake from different angles.

I told myself that if I’d given myself more time, then maybe I could have gotten it to look nicer, but now I was in no mood to tear it all down and start over, either, especially not when we’d only be here for only tonight.

“It’s cute. I mean, look where we are, right?”

I was sure she was just being nice, even if I couldn’t suss out any over-encouraging tones.

Still, I tried to let go of the weight of my own expectations to perform. The river was reflecting the sunset, which turned the gaps in the clouds a lovely shade of orange and blue.

“Yeah,” I managed.

“What are we gonna do with the rest of our time?”

I looked over at her, where she was already crouched in the little shack I’d erected, setting out our blankets.

“Plan out tomorrow.”

She nodded, a countenance of sudden focus crossing her pretty features as she stood back up and stomped through the tall grass to get more supplies. I don’t know why she bothered with the heavy footfalls to push down the grasses, it wasn’t like ticks could get her and there hadn’t been much growth up into the old path, either.

“Any bites yet?” I called out.

“No,” she called back. “Not even with what I’m told is the best bait in the world.”

“Just as well, I don’t know how to cook without a fire, and I’m not sure if lighting one is against the rules.”

“I can check,” she brought out the omni-pad. A few seconds later, she got a response and sighed as she read aloud: *“Fire in the wrong place and time could get you killed.”* then she brightened. *“But you can light one for this exercise without penalty. Enjoy yourselves.”*

That we’d even thought to ask had probably avoided us being penalized.

At least I didn’t need to rub sticks together. I’d have had no idea what I was doing and probably looked even more foolish. We used the firestarting material that Natalie identified as an additive to replace our lack of laspistol, which apparently had such a setting. The littlest sticks caught first, a few more I’d set just inside the ring or jagged stones Natalie had gathered hissed as trapped moisture bubbled and escaped.

“Sorry,” I muttered at the pathetic-seeming fire. Nothing I was trying to do seemed to be working. “Can you see what else is around?” I called back out, trying to toss a few more sticks onto the fire.

At least it’d keep her away from yet another embarrassing failure of mine. Maybe I could fix this, get it working.

“Yeah, I’ll make a note. ‘My boyfriend struggles at keeping a flame running hot’,” Natalie grunted. Shit. She’d seen. “He keeps letting himself get distracted. If only they knew the mighty Emperor had such a flaw…”

It sounded like she was straining, and I looked up to see her waddling, back toward me arms at full extension and muscles straining as she dragged an enormous log toward our little campsite, before she cast another look over her shoulder, giving me a small, if slightly stressed smile.

It had been cut in half lengthwise and lopped on either end at a little over ten feet long, sawn neatly. With a closer squint, I could imagine it sitting atop some of the large stones she’d just brought me to form a large bench to look out over the riverbank we were on.

“Well, that’s a bit big for the fire…” I said slowly, and she dropped it instantly.

“You said to grab-”

I looked at where I’d reorganized those stones to form the outer ring of what I’m sure would become the world’s roughest shelter, just in case the clouds overhead drizzled the way the weather report suggested. Then I looked at the notched bottom of the log and the scratches.

Natalie had almost definitely just dismantled a lovely little wooden bench that had likely perched atop those very rough cut stones.

*Oops.*

Given how overgrown everything was, I doubted anyone would miss it, but still.

The huge log was somewhat light for its size, though ‘somewhat light’ meant I could lift one end of it and slowly drag it the rest of the way toward the shelter across the grass after Natalie had marched off in irritation.

I glanced at where I’d left out the spade, and considered how sharp it had seemed and the strange button, along with Morsh’s warning to not let it touch me when ‘on’. I gave it a flick, and then dug it against the trunk’s leading side.

The spade-shaped tool went right through. Experimentally, I poked at the wood with my finger, only to find it not at all soft or rotten. I gave another stab into the trunk at a 90 degree angle from my first and found [I could practically scoop out the chunk like it was made of ice cream.](https://fxtwitter.com/fearedbuck/status/2012306241817616867?s=46&t=)

*Impressive.*

My speed picked up as I pulled one of the stones from the foundation and began tapping away at the handle whenever it got stuck, until I had carved out a wedge on one side, my hands aching slightly.

It took a little bit of time to notice, but the thing thrummed in my hand- maybe from the carving hitting something, or maybe that was part of how it worked.

I flexed my fingers and let go of the tool. Not a bad start, all things considered. Too thick, and I doubted it’d carry us. Too thin, and we’d punch a hole and have wasted all this time for nothing.

I tried to feed each little chunk to the fire, then just gave up in favor of contemplating what I was doing, and whether it was worth the effort.

“Give it a rest?” Natalie suggested.

I set down the tool back where I’d left all the others out, then groaned at my own stupidity. If Morsh had decided the simulation needed some livening up, I’d have had to choose between fighting or else running for my life, leaving everything behind and likely- no, almost certainly failing the exam. I began repacking each item one at a time, trying to get them organized, leaving the alien carving tool aside.

“So, what are you doing?” She asked, a slight pout on her features. “With the log, I mean.”

Right, I had promised to bring her in on any plans, hadn’t I?

I came around next to where she’d shuffled sideways to let me into the makeshift shelter.

“Map?” I asked, and she slowly handed it to me.

“We have a decision to make.” I unfolded the old atlas, finally sitting down next to her.

“I’ve been trying to think of a way across the Delaware River.”

“What we’re [situated on here is a river, right](https://i.imgur.com/BE6BkD5.jpeg)? Can’t we swim across?” She pointed across the narrow embankment. I shook my head at her suggestion.

“Natalie, it’s the Delaware River, it’s over a mile wide. The *big* one.” I pointed at the unfolded map, and then at where we were for comparison. “We could try and time the crossing between the tides, but then there’s the fact that ships and ferries pass through there, and I bet a rescue is a capture and a fail. It’s…” I sighed. I didn’t want to say ‘impossible.’ I just didn’t see us swimming across as something that was ever possible for us to do. Even if I was perfectly rested and left every piece of kit behind. Still, it was never a good idea to discourage your team. “...It’s going to be difficult.”

“And the log?” She pointed. “I mean you’re doing something with it, other than carving up firewood. Right?” She sounded almost eager. Too eager, given how little faith I had. It was hard to let her down.

“Yeah. *If* we can carve this out into a watercraft, then we *might* be able to float down the Brandywine.” I dragged my finger down the map’s river, and she watched as if entranced. “That would also give us some practice navigating obstacles, that sort of thing. The problem is going to be that Wilmington’s at the junction with the Delaware River. There is no chance in hell she’ll let us just float it down the river right through the city without failing us. We’re in ‘enemy territory,’ after all.”

And now that I thought about it, Bancroft Base was close, too. Sure, we’d abandoned it, but I didn’t relish the idea of trying to float past with a shil’vati girl, while dressed in alien garb. Little laminated piece of paper or no, someone would certainly take exception. What if Morsh escalated the matter from ‘slightly uncivil disagreement involving firearms’ to ‘breaking the treaty over one meaty thigh?’

I sighed at imagining trying to placate Amilita’s certain outrage at me, as Emperor, over hearing I, as Elias, had been shot at, by my own people.

[I kept tracing the river again with my finger, and realized it also came perilously near to Warehouse Base, entering a three-way junction with the Christina river just a few blocks toward the Delaware. Just *great.*](https://i.imgur.com/RxeEm4q.png)

“So, what then?”

“Portaging?”

“What?”

“I carve and carve, until it’s light enough to carry over land.” I put my thumb against our start point, and our finger to where we’d come, and then twisted my wrist to use them like an old compass to plot a rough route, pinching my fingers as they ‘stepped’ their way just south of Talay, past my hometown, and all the way to the Delaware River, then tried to get a guesstimate of the days we had.

She looked nervous. “That’s pretty far. We could get spotted.”

“I know,” I admitted. “Also, I’m sure you’ve noticed, I also don’t *actually* know how to carve a canoe.”

“Then what were you just doing?” She was finally losing her patience with me, and I hung my head.

“I don’t know? My best, I guess?”

There was a moment’s silence.

Some part of her was probably doubting if I really was Emperor, or if Emperor was really anything at all.

“You’re doing well.”

Great. Pity. I couldn’t deliver when it mattered most.

I wasn’t, really. I should have started by seeing if I could carve from the flattened top toward the bottom, and accepted even a very basic front, even if it basically gave us a really shitty log flume to cling to while we kind of aimlessly drifted down the river, soaked to the bone after tumbling out because I hadn’t dug it out deep enough.

“If I make it light enough to carry quickly, we’ll risk punching a hole clean through it. Plus, it’s normal to have a canoe along a river. Less so overland, while dressed like this. Someone will call it in.” I squinted to find which little swaths of green had creeks, and tried to remember which neighborhoods had been abandoned. Maybe we could cross most of the overland route through them. We’d definitely be carrying it a few miles, through woods, over creek embankments and more. Risky and tiring, not to mention slow-going.

“I don’t want to carry it overland. And I don’t want to go down the river. And I don’t want to try and find something and start over from the banks of the Delaware.”

All our options sucked.

But I supposed that would be the simulation situation, wouldn’t it? No good options, I just had to be trusted to pick the least-bad one, and not pitch a fit.

“Worst case, I can carve out a wooden board from this, you know? It’ll float. We can cling to it, one person to each side, and then swim across with a lot less effort than it’d otherwise take.”

Now I was imagining turning it into a two-person paddleboard. Sans paddle. In the middle of the Delaware. Without a paddle.

*Okay, not a great option, either. A Distant Plan B if I carve a hole through it like an idiot.*

Mister Emperor, the man the galaxy’s brightest minds couldn’t find a way to stop. Foiled by a river in a simple training exercise, in his own backyard. Maybe I wasn’t thinking out of the box enough.

She was leaning in, eyes closed, and I had a feeling she wasn’t even listening to me, so I shot up to my feet, sending her almost sprawling and sputtering in surprise. Of course, the thought of stealing a paddle had led me to the obvious!

“We could hijack something! Steal a car.”

That recommendation got her to jolt back upright, back away from where she’d been leaning in. “What?”

“I mean we’re already on the run in this scenario, right?”

“What?” She managed again, looking a little angry at me.

She was right, of course. It was a stupendously stupid idea. The other states’ Marines had caught on to the danger of insurgents slipping over the border, and had clamped down on illegal crossings, of course. So Pennsylvania’s Ben Franklin and Commodore Barry bridges, the next nearest after the still-being-reconstructed Delaware Memorial were both out of the question. If the scenario were real, we couldn’t exactly bluster our way past border checkpoints by saying: ‘Oh, excuse me, I’m with a noblewoman, please let us through, it’s an emergency training exercise.’

Disguises were also out.

“Sorry.” I said again, sitting back down again. “I’ll keep thinking. Nevermind.”

She sat back and knocked her feet against mine, letting the boots make a hollow *thud.*

The alien boots were a change from what I was used to, but didn’t really throw me off. At least compared to the stupid skin-tight fabric armor I was wearing which made me feel entirely too conspicuous. At least they were made of, or else covered with a hardshell of some sort.

I’d worn a hoodie and pants stitched together out of Shil’vati Marine kit before, seamed together as best as the tailor could manage. Even so, the cut had been comparatively extremely baggy in several places, some of its natural elasticity gone along with the protective qualities either through damage in removal from its former wearer, or else the trimming and stitching somehow negatively affected it. Even that felt far less exposed than what I was now wearing. 

It irked me that a fellow human might pass by and laugh. It bothered me that I felt exposed- to whoever might come by, to Natalie, to the whole world. There was something that felt deeply uncivilized about it in a way I couldn’t even bring up to Natalie without sounding either insulting or like I was joking, when it was truly heartfelt.

I pulled my knees up to my chest and poked at the fire a bit more.

“I don’t suppose the fishing line had any bites?” I asked again.

She shook her head solemnly, looking me in the eyes. “I think you keep scaring the fish.”

I let out a sigh and hopped up, jumped down the embankment to the river. I plucked the rod from where we’d left it in the sandy soil, and came back. The fire was still struggling to keep going, most of the wood still too wet from last night’s light rain to catch properly.

“Hell with it.” I dug into the MREs. To my surprise, mine was simply labelled ‘human.’ *I doubt it’s the ingredients.*

One tug on the corner to expose…tasteless, grey goop. My stomach instantly rumbled unhappily, as if demanding answers for the crime I’d just committed.

*At least it’s not purple,* I tried to encourage myself.

But hey, at least it was probably cheap to make and definitely easy to store and carry. It had that going for it.

The cicadas started to decline and the crickets and frogs picked up the slack, adding to the rushing water. Fireflies slowly drifted up from the blades of grass, flickering. There were far more than even last year’s.

“Wow,” she mused. “You know, Earth has its natural beauties.”

“It does,” I agreed, forgetting momentarily about the sludge roiling around in my gut.

She shuffled off her armor outer layer, revealing just a plain tank top underneath- and nothing else. “What?” She asked. “I’m used to human clothing.”

It seemed she hadn’t quite fully gotten the hang of it, though, given she was still missing a garment that usually went with, or at least under the top. I was also staring, so I broke off to again inspect the structure, wondering for the umpteenth time just how rickety it might be, eyes wandering to every corner and certainly not back down, no matter how tight she squeezed her shoulders together.

“Well,” Natalie started the conversation back up. “So…uh…” she patted her blanket and mine, spread over the matted down grass, and I realized how small the little ‘room’ I’d built was. Cozy.

Intimate, one might even call it.

“Do you want me to take the first watch?” The words sprang to my lips.

“I don’t think Morsh intends on ambushing us, and we’ll need our strength. So I mean-” she swallowed. “I mean that we should probably get some sleep soon.”

I turned and scooped up the alien tool.

I hadn’t failed. Not yet. “I’m going to keep trying,” I determined. “Whether we carry it or float down in it, I don’t care, but I think this is our best option for crossing the river.”

“But you don’t know what you’re doing,” Natalie protested. “Let’s have a rest, think about it. Maybe we can find some schematics on the datanet. Blueprints.”

“No one ever really *knows* what they’re doing until they’ve tried at least a few times, and every time has a first.” Either way, we could sit for a century and the odds were good we’d get no easier time with our task than the present.

The gloves in the bag came in handy in protecting my palms from the hum of the tool, and soon enough the canoe was a little more boat-shaped. I wouldn’t even really call it a ‘canoe’, or even a kayak. It had a rounded hull, far too wide, and for a pair of ‘paddles’ I was drying out a couple branches I’d whittled down with the knife. It would be like trying to paddle with a coffee stir stick, but it was better than nothing. Even if they were an unfortunate mix of being both heavier and thinner than I thought a paddle ought to be.

Hopefully they’d dry out a bit by being near the fire.

I resolved to give each a coating of the alien epoxy spread across the surfaces in the morning, just to try and waterproof and somewhat reinforce them.

Tired, and muscles aching, I evaluated the ‘canoe’. I tried picking it up by one end, and found it to still be quite heavy, though not the ‘impossible to carry over a small distance’ that it had been. The grooves were still cut rough, and it had gouges from times where my hand had slipped and I’d gone too deep. I was far from a craftsman, but it was starting to resemble something I imagined floating down the river in.

Besides, if we failed, we failed, right? No big deal. I wasn’t going to actually die, or have to serve in their armed forces, or anything, anyway. It might even get me some free time to get back to the insurgency, and better evaluate my situation before departure.

The only reason I was taking it so seriously was Morsh’s advice to treat it ‘as if it was real.’ I could imagine the enemy was a Shil’vati, or peer-equivalent, and be judged by an expert as to how well I’d done. That might come in handy.

Surely it was more than not wanting to fail in front of my girlfriend, right? Even if I was getting skittish every time she acted a bit weird.

Swallowing my nerve, I gave her another look. I smiled as I realized she’d all but passed out, and the fire died down during all my extra time working. Just as well, given the late summer heat. The residual smoke would work to keep the mosquitos away. 

At last I felt like I’d done enough, and set the tool back down. The sight of her had gone from making me anxious to instead one of almost longing. I couldn’t believe the time I’d probably wasted, especially if tomorrow it ended up being some kind of unstable, terribly unworkable idea that either would instantly capsize or else fall apart the moment we sat in it.

*Whatever happens, happens.*

I stepped over her prone form, and then after a moment’s hesitation where my heart hammered in my ears, I rolled over to where I was behind her.

I felt the thin layer of our emergency sheets- and realized she’d arranged them so there was no barrier between her and I. I froze up even as heat travelled up my cheeks. This was wrong. She wasn’t awake. She couldn’t consent, couldn’t tell me to do it, or whether she wanted to. Then again, it was all backwards in their society, right? Or did I want to confirm all the negative things they said about us humans? No, of course I didn’t, right?

My hand slowly wandered forward, and found its way around her shoulder, only for her to jolt awake. I froze up again.

“Whua?” She managed, before my arms wrapped around her shoulders.

“Shhh,” I whispered against the back of one of her long ears. “It’s alright.” At least, I sure hoped it was.

She let out a shuddering sigh when I said that, and I felt the tension bleed out of her. Quietly, so mumbled I almost didn’t hear it, let alone believe my ears when she said: ‘Can you say that again, for me?’

I repeated myself. Once, twice, and the fingers of my right hand slowly worked on their own to trace little circles where I held her shoulder, trying to massage out the knot of tension I felt. I wasn’t really ‘comfortable,’ I’d only been in this position a few times before, but slowly either her or my body adjusted or else shifted positions to where it was just manageable, and slowly grew to what could be called ‘comfortable.’ Slowly, we shifted to rocking her as I kept whispering reassurances that everything would be okay.

Suddenly, she turned her head to look over at me, probably catching me staring at her wide-eyed and surprised, and perhaps a little bit guilty in my thoughts.

“Elias?” She asked.

“Huh?” I answered her question with a question.

“Do you think I’m ‘pretty’?”

“Uh, yeah,” I said slowly, taking entirely too long to process the question. “You’re pretty cute. And pretty. Why?”

She turned back around and I felt her sigh under my fingers. “No reason.”

I wondered if that was either permission or an invitation to wander my hand further forward from her shoulder and under the strap of her top, or whether it was just an idle question, apropos of nothing. I’d answered the question, hadn’t I?

*Come on. This is Natalie, it’s not like that. If she wants something, she’ll say so. You both have a big day tomorrow.*

Even if the shil’vati idea of adulthood was now only just around the corner, I still felt unprepared for it in a lot of ways. I could force development, force myself to change, but to what end? To what positive outcome? I knew it would change things. Did I want those things to change?

Not for as long as I didn’t know the answer with complete certainty.

I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep, hand still on her soft and rounded shoulder, holding her against me.

The survey of the roaster landscape took on a life of its own…

Initially 8 two- or three-coffee blind tastings, to select beans that would advance to subsequent rounds. In all there were ~~26~~ 27 tastings across all rounds. In three headers, the bottom choice was dropped, the 2nd place had to compete against other 2nd place finishers to advance, and the 1st place advanced automatically. 2nd placers competing only advanced their winner, so no 2-down beans advance.

We did have an issue where Hundred House had done a collab with Café de Chamarel in Mauritius and the resulting beans advanced but we drank too much of it, and so had none left for later rounds. We subbed in a quick three header for 28/34 blends to provide a contestant to take its place. 

N.B. the results simply reflect my wife's preferences, and are conflicted by the specific beans we bought from each roaster…

**Memory Transcription Subject: Ullr Hoback, Human KC Military Captain**

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\] June 24, 2160**

Artaya is already a bit heavy, maybe even for her size, but today marks a new level of heaviness as my body struggles for breath as I wake up. Her ~~immense~~ healthy weight compresses me into an Ullr pancake, and I put all of my conscious effort into taking my hand and booping it against the wet nose currently snuggled into my neck. The wolf-fox-lady just snorts into my hand and pushes even closer to me in response.

“Artayaaaaaaa, get up please.”

“Nooooooo, my body is broken. I cannot go on.”

“Shit, you too? Skijoring is tough stuff, huh?”

“Ullr, you’re already much more fit than me, and yet I dragged you behind me across the entire forest. I. Cannot. Move.”

“Fine, then I’ll help you move.”

“How can you- whoa!”

In a quick motion, I roll my shoulder over, letting Artaya flip like a log over my back and tumble into the wall of the camper in the bunk. She doesn’t even try to arrest herself as her head gives a bit of a sickening thump and she instantly goes still, legs stiff up in the air.

*Ah,* ***fuck***\*. I killed her. She was pushed to the limit, and this was just too far.\* ***Fuck***\*, Ullr, you just killed your best friend.\*

“*Aowwooowa*, Ulllllrrrrr, I can’t mooooooove. G-go on without me…”

*Thank God*

“Alrighty then, Imma freshen up and then make some breakfast. Don’t get too active and antsy on me now, okay?”

“Awwawa…”

*Maybe she is dead, and these are her last groaning breaths? Complaining till the very end—fitting…*

I slip up and out of the bunk, leaving the upside-down lady to stare at the wall while I make quick use of the bathroom and wash the sleep out of my eyes and the morning out of my mouth. Leaving the bathroom, I find the woman in the same position; only this time, her head lazily tracks me as I start to rummage through the cold storage. Strategically pulling out her favorite ker bacon, I smile as she finally rolls over to her belly and then slinks off the bed to use the bathroom for herself.

With expert timing, she returns just as her mythically rare bacon is plated and sits across from my expertly crispy yet tender bacon next to my coffee. The next hour or so is spent as two zombies stare blankly at each other while sipping on various forms of caffeine and chewing on bacon strips. Eventually, the light returns to both of our eyes, and we both reluctantly suit up for yet another day of high-speed, open-air travel across the vast frozen planet.

Artaya gets outside first and has the camper and snowmobile mostly hooked up without any assistance from me. I help with the last stabilizer leg and throw my legs on the snowmobile’s saddle, ready for another ride. Artaya soon has herself locked into her own quadrupedal seat and lets her head slack forward and rest on my back as I begin to take off into the powder drifts.

*She’s getting a lot better at operating the camper parts. I guess she is partially bipedal… Wait a second, was she purposely only using her quadruped form to get out of lifting work?! Sly dog…*

“Hey, ‘Taya?”

“Yuhhh?”

“Were you always on all fours to avoid lifting things around me, or is it just coincidental now that I know you can walk normally that you are doing more things?”

“Stop calling it walking ‘normal’ when you’re the weirdo who walks around with your back legs all messed up. Anyway, no, I’m just more comfortable operating the trailer now that I’ve seen you do it so many times. Remember, ***you*** designed this thing with Alavel; I had no say in the controls.”

“True!”

*Oh man, I really do hope that I can get back to Alavel someday. She needs a nice bottle of gift liquor and I need some help making a bigger bed…*

\------

Finally, after an entire full day of travelling again, we finally make the final climb through a quickly rising forest road. At long last, with a blast of wind and sudden clearing of greenery, we slide up into the very base of the volcanic mountain glowing in the setting sunlight. I look this way and that until…

“Artaya, how the hell do we get up this thing?”

“I… hmmmm… Can the motor sled climb the slope? Like if you go back and forth so it’s not too steep?”

“No no, those rocks will shred this thing…”

My eyes scan the mountainside looking for something, anything that could mark an old trail or path or just any sign of the old inhabitants of Esquo making use of the landmark. Then, I spot it.

“Oh! Are those radio towers of some sort up there?”

“I think so. Why?”

“If they have them up there, that means they needed some way to get to them for maintenance. There’s a road somewhere on this big rock, and I’m gonna bet it’s on the south face.”

“Why the south side?”

“Sun is in the south, so the snow there will melt faster, making the road clearer quicker.”

“Ohhhh, Ullr! I didn’t know you could think so hard!”

“Say that again and I’ll show you just how fast this ride can go across this slope.”

“Forget I said anything…”

Taking my own theory into action, I grip the throttle and start our way to the south side of the mountain until an expected path reveals itself to us.

\------

“I’ll admit it, good deduction, Ullr.”

“I know, right? Look at this ole path! Sure, it’s pretty rutted after decades of weather exposure, but that same exposure has this sand looking soft as snow.”

I step off the snowmobile and scoop my hand into the first bit of non-snow-covered sand on the winding road before us. Rubbing the grains between my fingers affirms its texture is more than adequate for taking the snowmobile and trailer up.

“Hell ‘Taya, this sand is even softer than the stuff on Tellus. I mean, we don’t have the right tread shape or skis on this thing, but that’s more of a speed issue than an ability issue. Only a few min of sunlight left, wanna park it here or start our way up?”

From her perch on the snowmobile backsaddle, Artaya lets her head flop to the side on the rest as her ears and eyes think back and forth. I know she has an answer when her ears shoot right back up to full attention.

“I think it’d be best if we go as far as we can up the mountain. The sooner we can start our transmissions, the sooner we can be back out of sight and somewhere safer.”

“Up the mountain it is!”

I hop back in my driver’s position and let the treads make a final transition from snow to sand as we scrape and creak a path into the service road. The road continues straight and steep for a long while until the battle against gravity wins out and the path turns to switchbacks cut into the slope. One after the other we turn until a sudden problem becomes very apparent.

“Gugh, Artaya, I know your nose is better than mine. How is it that you’re handling these shit-smelling gases from the volcano?”

“Uwwer, I’m been holdin’ my breadth fer while now.”

“Shit, is there anything we can do?”

“Nahope.”

“No one will be able to say we didn’t sacrifice anything on this mission…”

With the smell of sulfur clouding my judgement and my nose, I make some sloppier turns on the ever-turning road until a rather unfortunate sight fills my vision. Weariness and even more weariness fills my body and my bones as I let the snowmobile stop and my head hit the handlebars.

“Ullr, is that a landslide blocking the road?”

“Yep.”

“Are we stuck here then?”

“I mean, it looks easy enough for us both to shovel a path through.”

“Tonight!?”

*Hah, who does she think that we are? Two endless-energy teens?*

“Fuck. No. I’m eating dinner and going to bed. That is a tomorrow problem.”

“Oooh, bedtime does sound nice.”

In lockstep, I shut off and put the snowmobile in park on the slope, and then together we go about locking every stabilizer and brake on the camper. For the first time since the streets of Brother’s Gate, I find myself starting to sweat a bit, and I pull my gloves off. The mountain air blowing down feels warm and cozy despite its pungent smell. 

With everything set, we both enter the camper and go about taking our riding gear off. I cringe as a torrent of black sand pours off my own gear, and a similar amount comes out of Artaya’s fur right onto the floor.

“Ugh, this fine sand is even worse than Tellus’. Ullr, can you fix dinner while I wash off?”

“Hold on there, you’re forgetting something.”

“I am?”

“We don’t have snow here to feed the water tanks. Bathroom is needs only until we get back down. No showers.”

She stops dead in her tracks, and for the first time in a long while, I wonder if I am going to see her cry. She luckily composes herself and instead just shakes and shakes and shakes as an entire beach of sand falls off of her onto the floor. I grin as she thankfully gets the broom and does her best to collect and dispose of the sand as I rummage through the freezer for a much-needed dinner.

\------

The alarm in my brain tells me that it’s time to get up for the day ahead, but my body knows what it’ll be subjected to if I comply.

*Shoveling, a whole lot of shoveling. Dammit.*

With a groan, I tap the lady holding me down awake. She slithers off the top of me onto the floor below and sleepily stumbles to the bathroom without a word. I get myself up and wait for my turn as I look out the windows to survey the blockage ahead. It’s rather imposing in height but less so in depth, from what I can tell.

With Artaya done with her morning routine and myself done soon after, we have a quick breakfast while enjoying the spectacular sunrise from the far horizon. Then, unfortunately, it’s time to suit up. I open the door to a suddenly familiarly smelly air and go around to the equipment trunk on the side of the camper. A few shovels are inside; the two biggest are sized for me. Artaya goes into her human-walk and does her best to grab a full-sized one but relents and grabs the one for her as she heads off to the slide.

I follow her over, and we work in silent effort at the surprisingly hot black mountainside and high altitude. I feel a rhythm overcome me as the blockage begins to disappear bit by bit. In what cannot be more than two hours of shoveling, I do a double check on the slot we have carved versus the width of our ride.

“Hey Artaya, I think we can give it a go now. This might be just enough to get over.”

Her shovel instantly flops out of her hands, and she goes right back down onto all fours while pressing her tails against her lower back.

“O-oh sweet Esquo, thank you. I-I can’t do much more anyway.”

We put both shovels on the snowmobile’s cargo rack and quickly ready the camper for moving. Back in the saddle, I take the throttle low and slow in the torque, and the treads grip and tug us right up the steep incline. I carefully watch the camper skis to make sure it doesn’t high-center, and we luckily escape no worse for wear.

“Hey hey, look at that! Good job, us!”

The fox-lady doesn’t even budge behind me, as her head is firmly resting on her seat.

“Y-yay… go team…”

*Yeah, she’s pretty good endurance-wise, but probably not on two legs with a shovel in her hand.*

“Hey, Artaya, you can take a quick nap if you need while I take us further up.”

“That… that sounds nice. Thank you, Ullr.”

As her eyes drift closed, I continue our climb up and constantly scan both the road ahead and the skies all around to observe any incoming weather or extraterrestrial visitors. The path snakes up and up and up until my heart sinks as I see yet another blockage on the road. I slow to a stop and scratch the ears of my superior officer to wake her back up. She opens one eye to stare at me as her head leans into it.

“What is it?”

“Another roadblock. Ready to shovel again?”

“H-how far up are we?”

“Ehhh, maybe three-quarters or so?”

“Shit, okay, we probably need a bit higher if we can. Ahhh, let’s get to it…”

I double-check my parking job, and together we slide off the seat and grab our shovels once more. The shoveling is understandably even tougher with the full day’s sun right on us, heating us despite the bitter winds that occasionally circle around the slopes. The high elevation is double trouble, as the lack of air makes it harder to breathe, and the UVs have less barrier to stop them from drying my lips and cooking my skin.

This time, the work is half as fast for half the results. With a much shittier path, I decide to take a chance with the hump in the road. I shoo Artaya away and point her to stand upslope on the other side of the block while I take the camper over. She readily slinks over with her shovel, and I quickly get the camper and snowmobile moving. The track grips and slips in a nearly uncontrollable pattern, but I manage to barely get over with an Artaya staring at me wide-eyed on the other side.

“Ullr, was that as dangerous as it looked?”

“Probably more.”

“I… uh, okay, let’s put a bit more effort into this path on the way down.”

I wearily nod in agreement as she tosses her shovel in the cargo rack and jumps back on behind me. We go up another few switchbacks until I see yet another blockage across the road just a few hundred feet higher than we just were. Artaya audibly growls behind me, and I can’t help but agree with a groan of my own.

“Ullr, we’re high enough. Get this damn thing flat-ish, and we’re doing it from here, okay?”

“Yes, ma’am!”

**Memory Transcription Subject: Artaya, Jaslip KC Military Colonel**

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\] June 26, 2160**

As he sets the camper in place and balances everything out. I open the equipment trunk on the trailer and nearly throw in the two damned shovels. With it open, I look for the high-power emergency antenna and drag it out and onto the blisteringly hot sands. Holding the antenna in my tails, I climb the small ladder on the side of the trailer up to the roof. With easy attachment and power cables plugged into a roof port, it’s ready to go, and I climb back down to an awaiting Ullr. 

I take us inside, and I find the universal interface to access the antenna’s broadcasting ability.

*Just one thing left to do before we get this going…*

“Ullr, what do we want to say here, and to whom?”

With his outdoor clothes off, he gives his face and eyes a tired rub as he mumbles out a response.

“I dunno, uh, something about Federation invaders taking dead Jaslip and, I guess, still to the Consortium military, right? You just write it; you’re an actual trained officer and know their bullshit better than I ever could.”

*That is true; I did spend a career on this. Okay, let’s see here.*

>**EMERGENCY NOTICE**

>**AT APPROXIMATELY \[18:00 JUNE 18, 2160 STANDARDIZED HUMAN TIME\], SEVERAL SHIPS OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN WERE IDENTIFIED PERFORMING ORBITAL SURVEYING AND ATMOSPHERIC SAMPLING OF ESQUO’S NORTHERN HEMISPHERE.**

>**THE FOLLOWING DAY, A DRONE SHIP FROM THIS FORCE WAS OBSERVED ENTERING THE HIBERNATION CHAMBER OF KARISK’S FANG AND COLLECTING TWO JASLIP CORPSES, BOTH OF WHICH WERE BROUGHT TO A MOTHERSHIP IN ORBIT.**

>**INITIAL IDENTIFICATION OF THE SHIPS WAS TIED TO FEDERATION FORCES, BUT AS THE INSIGNIA WAS NOT RECOGNIZED AND INTEL THAT THE FEDERATION DOES NOT POSSESS DRONE SHIPS NOR HAS THE PLANET BEEN GLASSED SINCE THE JASLIP CORPSES WERE TAKEN, IT CANNOT BE CONFIRMED AS FEDERATION PRESENCE.**

>**KCM COMMAND ON AVOR: PLEASE PROVIDE CONFIRMATION OF RECEIVING THIS BROADCAST UPON DELIVERY.**

>**COLONEL ARTAYA OF CLAN KETITAT**

*I mean, it’s a bit wordy, but that’ll get the job done… Just another click and… there, broadcasting duration set to end this time tomorrow.*

“Welp, Ullr, it’s going out on the Consortium Military Emergency Broadcast encrypted network. I have it set to end this time tomorrow.”

“Nice, nice… Then what?”

“My thought is that we’ll wait another full day for any message to come in response, and if not then, well, then we use that Esquo’s Fighter’s emergency beacon for another full day of signaling and then listening. And if we don’t hear anything in the next four days… I-I don’t know.”

Ullr’s face drops, but surprisingly a light starts to spark somewhere deep in his head.

“Then-then we’re here for life, I guess. However long that lasts. Okay, okay… Uhh, then we find whichever subterranean city is in the best condition and force the camper and snowmobile in there. You can sleep through the whole fucking winter, and I’ll chill out hunting and hanging around the dwarf architecture. Then when we’re too old to hunt and shit, we’ll just starve to death. Sound good?”

“Oh, yeah, that sounds great, but you’re forgetting something big. If I sleep the whole winter like normal, then I’ll outlive you by a few decades. Which means I’ll get to care for you in your old age.”

“Unless I drug you with that coffee shit, and then we can die together!”

“Perfect, just brilliant, Ullr! A whole life together!”

Ullr’s face suddenly drops as his cheeks turn a bright red, and he quickly looks away from me.

*What is bothering him about a whole life-ohhhhhhh. Oh.*

My own snout follows his blush as I go deep purple all the way to my ears, and he tries to get us back on course.

“Ahem, well, Artaya we don’t have much to do for the next few days, then, and it’s already time to eat again. Want to eat?”

“Sure, sure…”

*Damn it. This is going to be a long four days in this camper.*

\------

The day of Consortium broadcasting came and went, and it now comes down to the last few hours of listening before a decision to declare rebellion becomes our only choice. I find myself staring at Ullr, who himself is staring out the window at the same nothing that was there all morning, all day yesterday, and all day the day before. An intense wave of boredom blankets me as I can’t think of any more songs to listen to or table games to play.

*I wish I was home, and then Mom or Dad could- Wait, that’s a good point.*

“Hey Ullr?”

His eyes and head lazily turn my way with a similar boredom plastered on his face.

“Sup?”

“What are your plans once we get off of Esquo and back to Tellus?”

A smile creeps across his face, and his eyes crinkle on the edges as he seems to be talking right past me.

“I mean, I said the other day about just staying here if we don’t get a response, but I wasn’t entirely joking. I really do like it here. It’s a lot of fun to go around and explore, so… so if we are given some type of confirmation that Esquo is safe from whoever that was in orbit, I wouldn’t mind staying here for a while longer.”

“Don’t you have anything on Tellus you’d want to see again?”

“Eh, I don’t care much for that shithole besides my folks being there. Oh! I’d love to bring them here as well if I could. They’d love it too.”

“Hmm, I know all of my family would like to come back to Esquo if they could. Hah, maybe we could all get a clan house together. Hobacks and Ketitats together.”

“Yeah… that’d be…” 

*What’s he being shy about all of a sudden? I just suggested that we… Move our families together. Hey, Esquo to Artaya, that’s also known as marriage. You just told him that you want to marry him. Wait, do I?*

Ullr turns himself away, and the blush doesn’t even begin to fade as he starts to stammer something.

“S-so about that Esquo’s Fighters rebellion. W-what are-”

“***Ullr.*** What do you think about me?”

For the first time since I’ve met him, I see genuine fear chill his bones. Not nervousness, not pain, not anger, just pure fear. His eyes dart this way and that before he takes a short breath and begins to speak.

“I-It’s not exactly a secret to you that you’re my best friend, like, ever. I’m not kidding either; I’ve only known you for a month now but we’ve spent so much time together and… Well, long ago, my folks said that I’d know I’ve found the right person when I feel like they’re my best friend and that I want to spend the entire rest of my life beside them. Y-you certainly check that off. I can bullshit with you all day and night, you like a lot of the same things that I do, and you seem to know all the things I don’t.”

“You know, my parents said pretty much exactly the same thing to me, ***but*** they were certain I’d never find that person while I was in my military career. They weren’t right, obviously, but they weren’t wrong either. Oh my, I wonder how they feel about you being part of that ‘Federation” tribe living underground on Tellus?”

Ullr smiles back at my laugh, but there’s still something off—something scared about him. I take a breath as my own laugh falters, and I prod him just a bit more.

“Ullr, what’s wrong? Is there something else?”

“I-I don’t want to upset you, and this is really hard to say, but I feel like I need to be honest about my last hold-up.”

I snort at him in a giggle as I try and guess his problem.

“What is it, Ullr? Is it the fact that to me, you look like an overgrown, hairless pet obor, and to you, I look like a mutated version of a similarly common pet from back on Earth? Yeah, i-it’s strange having these feelings for what is a fucked-up person-version of a pet, but at the same time the way you talk to me with genuine interest, and how you cook for me, and when you dance with me in your arms… t-those are much more powerful feelings.”

Instantly, his head falls to the table with a hard thump as I nervously laugh at him suddenly shutting down again.

“Ffff***fuck***, I thought you were kidding when you called me an obor, like in revenge for calling you a fox or wolf or dog or whatever. I look like a stupid-ass monkey…”

“Ullr, I-I said what I think. W-what do you think?”

He drags his head up and stares at me with that same old care in his scrunched-up face.

“I already said that I’d be more than happy to spend the rest of my life with my best friend.”

“So… are we a couple or something now? Is this dating?”

“I-I don’t know. I mean, I’m not exactly looking to bring you to bed or anything, but we’re walking a knife edge here in what it means to be a couple. Can we put this on a mini-hold and just say that we’re *‘super duper best friends forever’* until we can guarantee that we and our family are all safe and sound?”

“That’s fair; I don’t disagree. Be done, be safe, and once we can look at everything with a bit less pressure, we can finalize this. More official things, parental approval, the whole deal.”

He reaches his hand across the table and gives me a long, thorough scratch of my ears, which I readily lean into.

“The whole deal.”

I spend who knows how long there on that table with my ears being pampered in a galactic-first-class Jaslip massage. Just as he releases me from his scritching trance, a series of small digital beeps come down onto the broadcast interface. I stumble out of my seat and leap at the message as its contents are decrypted.

>**TOP SECRET**

>**KREV CONSORTIUM ARMY DOWNLINK**

>**AH, SO THE FEDERATION IS GETTING ANTSY AND BREAKING OUR AGREEMENT? SHAME, WE HAD SUCH A NICE ARRANGEMENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORT, COLONEL ARTAYA. I APOLOGIZE ABOUT YOUR INDEFINITE STAY.**

>**UNDERSCALE HIGH COMMAND**

“So, Artaya, what does it say? Artaya?”

*Man, I fucking hate the Krev Military so,* ***so*** *much. Esquo’s Fighters, here we come.*

Let the pressure build until your asshole is practically exploding. You climb, circle, wait for the perfect target. Then you let fly.

We keep score. Five points for a clean headshot. Ten if it lands straight in the gob while they’re eating chips. Twenty-five if you slip it unnoticed into a drink. Fifty if they swallow it. That’s legend stuff. The stuff of dreams.

I’ve led the ranking for two summers straight. I know the winds above Bondi like the top of my beak. The boys — Bazza, Kenny, and Skinny Wing — call me The Craptain when they’re sober off bin-juice. They call me worse when I lap them. But I give as good as I get.

Cheating’s allowed, because that’s half the fun. We tune the ammo. Chips make a nice spread but the shit goes too soft in the scorching heat. Meat pies are heavy in your guts, great for thump shots. Soft-serve gives you ribbon. Pretty, but useless for scoring.

The real magic comes from bad food, the stuff that makes human hatchlings cry. Grease and sugar. Hold it long enough, the pressure builds. You feel it chamber.

Bazza swears he once landed a turd in a bloke’s Dare iced coffee. “Didn’t even notice till the end,” he cackled, scratching the cigarette scar under his eye. “Gave it a little swirl. Classy.” 

“A two-for-one would beat it,” I said.

They went quiet, because we all know the myth: one shit, two hits. No one’s done it. Not here. Not anywhere. You need pressure, control, timing, and a lot of skill. It’s not something you can just fluke.

On the day I discovered fingers made the best ammo, Bondi was packed. Heat waves swirling above the sand. Tourists turning beetroot. Lifeguards in red and yellow blowing whistles.

A bloke with thongs and a trucker hat lifted a chip. It was the opportunity I’d been waiting for. Not the chip — the soft, fat meaty sausages attached to it.

I dove towards him. Beak open and ready. Feathers rustling. Wind at my back.

He never saw me coming. My beak snapped down. With a twist of my head, his ring finger was mine. He didn't even have a chance to scream. He stared, confused, as blood painted the sand red.

When his brain caught up, he screeched for an ambulance. The other humans yelled for help. The flock froze for half a breath while his chip bag fluttered down like a sign of surrender.

The beach erupted when I gulped the finger down whole. Bazza whooped. Kenny did a loop to loop while squawking “Legendary!” The humans ran. Sheltered in cars and shops.

A few hours passed. They slowly ventured back to the shore as the finger worked it's way through me.

I did a little test behind the surf club. A steep dive. A grunt. Muscles clenching. Pressure building.

Pop!

A pellet shot out of me like a bullet.

Crack.

Straight through the windscreen of a nearby Corolla. The alarm shrieked. So did I. My wings shook with pride.

Bazza flared beside me, eyes wide. “You forged that?”

“New ammo,” I said. “Call it giving ’em the finger.”

He looked at the car. Then back at me, laughing so hard he nearly fell from the sky. “Craptain, you really are a mad bastard.”

By afternoon, whispers had spread through the flock. The humans tried fish-and-chips diplomacy, scattering peace-offerings in greasy arcs. We took them. Food is fuel after all.

But our game wasn’t over. We went back to work.

“Keep it in, boys,” I called, looping above the flags. “Pick your angles. Check the flags. There’s a bit of cross-shore wind. Small amount of lift, make sure to adjust your aim.”

A backpacker lifted her phone for a selfie. Skinny Wing dived, twisted, shot one off. A perfect arc. It splattered across the screen. He landed on the rail, puffed, and posed like a pelican.

As a lifeguard blasted his whistle, Kenny coated it white. It dropped straight into his mouth. Ten points; the guard coughed until he collapsed. The flock howled like wolves.

Then the fun really began. A teenager with a hot chip in one hand and bubble tea in the other screamed. Bazza spied his gaping mouth, went vertical, stalled, and dropped a neat white present down the kid’s throat. The kid turned green, staggered to the bins, and power-spewed.

The crew shook the air with their beaks. “Leaderboard!” they screamed. “Leaderboard!”

I waited until all eyes turned to me. A champion at his peak.

From up high the blood on the sand looked like freckled skin. Tourists ran to their cars under a hail of crap.

The flock exploded as one, chanting like gods.

I felt the weight building in me again. Heavier. Thicker. Stronger. The wind settled. The flags made a V. Everything arranged itself like a divine gift.

Target one: a loud man by the guard tower, arguing into a phone. Mouth wide. Sunburnt. Tongue swinging like it was trying to get my attention. Target two: an influencer in a tight black bikini. Boost Juice balanced on her knee. Snapping selfies. Battering her eyes. Taking tiny sips.

The distance. The angle. The way the breeze folded at the edge of the walkway. It was perfect.

Bazza coasted on the air currents beside me. “You thinking what I’m thinking?”

“I’ve been thinking it since the day I hatched,” I said.

I climbed until the waves looked flat and cries disappeared. The world sharpened to one mouth, one juice, and the invisible line between them. I tipped my wings and dropped.

Wind forced my head back. Railings rushed closer. Fillings glinted from the man’s teeth.

I waited until the last moment. Took a deep breath. Pushed with everything I had. Whimpered as my sphincter tightened. Just as I thought I was about to explode the finger frag shot out of me, heading straight towards him. The pellet ricocheted off his teeth and kept going. The angle and the breeze did the rest. It zipped low like a skipped stone, plunging into the influencer’s juice with barely a ripple.

There was a single, beautiful moment where time seemed to slow. The flock stopped and fell silent. Even the wind took a breath. The man gagged and bent double. Spat out the bloody remnants of his teeth. The woman sipped, frowned at the new taste, swallowed, and shuddered. Two screams followed soon after. Not the same note, but harmonised.

“The Two-for-one,” Bazza whispered, eyes wide.

The boys erupted, slamming wings and stamping railings. “One Hundred Points!” Kenny screamed, voice cracking. “One bloody Hundred!”

I banked hard and climbed straight through their noise. Past the smell of chips and sunscreen. High up into clean air, where no sound lives. Below me Bondi churned. Lifeguards ran. Tourists hid under towels. Shit shrapnel turned the sand white.

Bondi was ours now. The humans wouldn’t forget what happened. But they would come back. They always do. But after today, they’ll watch the sky. Think twice when they see a seagull, and that’s all because of me.

1qhz3pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnTikTok/comments/1qhz3pr/why_your_videos_arent_getting_views_and_what_to/,Why your videos aren't getting views and what to actually fix,"If I could talk to myself five months ago right when I was about to start, I'd tell myself to stop and think first. I've been making videos for five months and I finally average around 18,500 views per video. But I completely wasted the first three months doing everything wrong. I posted twice daily, studied viral content, tried every strategy I found online. My views never went above 625.

I thought maybe my voice was annoying or my content was too niche. That people who succeed just have better instincts than me. I was about to quit around month three.

Then I stopped trying random fixes and found what was actually broken. If I could start over today with what I know, I'd be at 18,500 views in a month instead of five months. Not because I'd be funnier or smarter. Just because I wouldn't waste three months on stuff that never helped.

Here's what I'd tell myself to stop doing.

Stop rewriting your opening line. I changed my first sentence constantly thinking that's where everyone scrolled away. My opening was fine. People stayed through the first four or five seconds. They dropped around second nine to thirteen when I was still building up instead of getting to the actual content. I wasted seven weeks on hooks that didn't need work.

Stop getting better equipment. I bought a microphone and lighting because I thought my phone setup looked amateur. Spent 170 dollars total. My retention dropped hard. The videos that performed were raw recordings on my phone with background noise. My video with 37,000 views was filmed on my phone in a coffee shop with people talking behind me. The better equipment killed my performance.

Stop following upload schedules. I read that posting at 6pm daily is crucial for growth. I uploaded at exactly 6pm for nine weeks straight. Nothing improved. My most viewed video went up at 11am on a Friday because I got impatient and just posted it. Nine weeks completely wasted on timing that did nothing.

Stop copying big creators. I watched people with hundreds of thousands of followers and tried to match their energy and cuts. It failed constantly because what keeps existing audiences engaged doesn't attract new viewers. Their approach assumes people already care. I spent three weeks trying to replicate their style.

Stop testing different topics. I thought making various content would show me what my audience wants. Posted lifestyle videos one week, then advice, then personal stories, then educational content. Views were identical for everything. The topic wasn't my problem. I was doing something wrong in every single video and changing topics just covered it up.

What I'd tell myself to do instead is locate where they leave and only fix that moment. Not the opening, not the camera, not when you post. Just find the second they're gone and change what's happening there.

It helped me a lot to use an app that shows what's wrong with your videos and exactly how to fix them to get more views. I use one called Tik.Alyzer and it tells you what's killing your views and what specific changes to make. Like it'll say cut the pause at second eleven because it's too long and people think it ended, or add a visual change at second eight because nothing moved. Regular analytics just show numbers without telling you what to actually fix. I would have saved three months if I'd found this earlier.

Once I stopped obsessing over openings and equipment and started fixing what was actually broken, my numbers jumped. Went from 625 views to 18,500 in less than a month. Same content style, same filming location. I just stopped working on things that didn't matter.

If you're just starting you're probably stuck where I was. None of it works until you know what's actually wrong with your videos and exactly how to fix it. Fix that before touching anything else. The rest is just noise.",7,1768909981.0,learnTikTok,0,1.0,False

The problem is that my default stack (Vercel, managed Postgres, Auth provider) costs me about $50/month even if nobody uses the app.

For a funded startup, who cares. For me, it creates this weird pressure. I feel like I have to rush to make money just to cover the server costs, instead of letting an idea grow naturally.

So I stopped using the ""modern stack"".

I moved everything to a cheap $5 VPS.

I swapped Postgres for SQLite (which is honestly faster because it's on the same disk). I swapped Vercel for Docker.

Now I run 3 apps on one server for the price of a coffee. If an idea fails, it costs me nothing to keep it online just in case it picks up later.

It took me a weekend to figure out the Docker config and backups (I stream the DB to S3 so I don't lose data), but it was worth it for the peace of mind.

If you're bootstrapping, stop paying for scale you don't have yet. A cheap Linux server is all you need.

1qhz29g,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qhz29g/all_the_pretty_things/,All the Pretty Things,"I am a reclusive old man living alone in the Appalachian wilderness, and I’ve lived in my little cabin for the better part of 50 years without incident. However, recently, things have started showing up on my doorstep- and the contents are horrifying.

It started with a note. A sheet of notebook paper I found taped to my door one morning.

It read, “It’s the pretty things that matter,” scrawled in black ink in large lettering across the page. On the back, there was a Polaroid. An off-kilter photo of what looked like a chest or box surrounded by trees.

A bit confused and unsettled, I set the note and photo on my coffee table and went on about my day, journaling and reading. There’s not much to do in the woods of Appalachia, so my days were usually spent enjoying nature, hunting, and fishing.

So that’s what I did, I finished my chapter and journal entry, then set off into the forest, rifle on my shoulder and fishing rod in hand.

The woods were eerily silent this day, which, if you know anything about Appalachia, is not a good sign. I was confident with my rifle, though, and hiked on, following the path to the river that I’d taken a million times before.

However, halfway through the hike, I discovered something that had not been on the trail before: A bloodied doll head was nailed through the forehead into a towering pine that swayed with the wind, its body nowhere to be found. Below the head, etched into the bark with what I assumed was a pocket knife, the phrase, “isn’t she pretty?” jagged and messy.

Feeling the unease wash over me, I decided it was best I return home for the day. The forest remained silent as I trekked back to the cabin, and it felt as though a million eyes were on me with each step I took. I could feel the atmospheric pressure change as thunder clapped overhead and the first droplets of rain began to fall.

Making it back home, I locked up extra tight, placing a chair underneath my door handle and locking every window.

The storm raged that night, and the wind howled outside, rocking the cabin back and forth gently. I had slept with my rifle, being the paranoid recluse that I am, and because periodically throughout the night, I thought I could hear the sounds of footsteps pounding against my front porch- pacing back and forth along the tiny 4x5 space.

Life was brought to my fears when the next morning, I found a new gift at my doorstep: The tattered and dirty shirt that appeared to have belonged to a little girl, between the ages of 4 and 8.

In denial, I tried rationalizing the experience by telling myself the weather had blown the shirt onto the porch, the wind had swept it up and carried it miles just for it to settle directly on my front porch. An attempt for me to walk away from the situation.

However, that rationalization quickly crumbled when I picked up the shirt, and beneath it lay another Polaroid photo:

A little girl standing at a bus stop, oblivious. The same pink and purple butterflies on her shirt as the ones on the shirt I now held in my hands. On the back, in black Sharpie and neat handwriting was the phrase, “Isn’t she pretty?” with a smiley face underneath.

I immediately loaded up into my old Ford Ranger and made my way to the closest police station, presenting them with the evidence. Looking into their missing persons database, they found a match for the girl in the picture. Only she had gone missing over 30 years ago, and her case had gone cold after about 15 years.

I explained the events to the police, with the doll’s head and the photo of the chest that I had received two nights ago, and they told me everything I already knew about Appalachia: how people go missing up here by the thousands every year, and how an absurd number of the cases go unsolved. Nevertheless, they assured me they’d examine the Polaroid for fingerprints and get back to me if they found any clues.

Being a gun owner, I refused any police protection at my residence, and I myself assured them that I too would be keeping a close eye out for any suspicious-looking person lurking near my remote cabin.

When I returned home, everything was just as I left it. No signs of any kind of trespassing or vandalism. I stayed in again this night, wanting to be here in case any more gifts arrived on my doorstep.

While I was at my stove cooking that night, through the sound of my radio playing 70’s rock music, I heard the creeping footsteps again on my front porch.

I rushed to grab the rifle from my bedroom and came bursting through the front door to find the sight of a pale, sickly-thin man, crouched down and peering into my kitchen window, Polaroid camera strapped around his neck. He was completely nude and bald-headed, and once he saw me, he screeched like an animal before springing over the baluster.

I fired blind shots as he fled at inhuman speed into the woods, leaving shrubbery and branches shaking as he sprinted. I fired another shot into the forest in his direction and heard another screech, but the sprinting persisted. I leaped from the porch and chased as fast as I could through the dense forest, stumbling over roots and running into trees in the darkness.

I could no longer hear the footsteps, so I gave up and walked back to the cabin, defeated.

I did not sleep a wink that night. The whole evening was spent on my porch, waiting for him to come back. Next time, I would not miss. I waited until the sun came up, and no trace of the man returned.

Becoming fluent in hunting during my time here in these woods, my first idea was to search for his blood. I had heard him screech again; I could’ve at least grazed an arm, and I could work from that.

I searched the whole area and found no sign of blood anywhere.

Defeated, I returned to the cabin. I went into town that day and bought some trail cameras that I placed around the area and on my porch. I was not going to miss my opportunity to catch or kill this guy again.

Days came and went with no sign of the man. My trail cams caught nothing, and gifts stopped appearing on my doorstep. Days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. I had almost succumbed and settled back into my life of comfort and serenity alone on my mountain until one faithful morning.

A new gift was on my porch. Not only that, but doll heads were nailed to every tree surrounding the perimeter. It wasn’t just doll heads, either. Limbs were separated from the torsos and crudely nailed to the trees, making them look like dissected bodies.

The same message under each display:

“Isn’t she pretty?”

The new gift was a jewelry box, dusty and decaying. Inside were dozens of rusted and bloodied earrings, each one bearing some variation of a butterfly.

After this, things escalated faster than I could account for.

I took the jewelry box to the police station and yet again explained the situation to the local police chief. The earrings were taken in for DNA examination, and as the earrings were being removed, a new Polaroid was found underneath the pile.

It was me, asleep in my bed, completely unaware, taken from beyond my bedroom window.

The chief insisted I have police protection at my cabin, and this time I agreed. This man had managed to find the one blind spot in my trail cams, and now he was toying with me.

DNA testing takes anywhere between 24 and 72 hours, so once more, I returned to the cabin, officers at my rear.

As you’d imagine, it’s difficult for me to park my Ranger on my property, let alone two additional police cars. That being said, the officers had to park their cruisers on the dirt road at the end of the driveway. The two officers stayed in their cars the whole night, rendering them nearly useless. That’s what makes what happened next so frustrating.

It had started to storm again, and lightning strikes flooded the cabin with flashing light every few seconds. Something was off, though, the strikes seemed…out of sync with the storm.

I focused in on this and noticed that there would be three quick flashes of light after every big flash of light, and then there’d be thunder.

Lightning struck again, and in the living room window, the outline of the man came into view. Three flashes came from his face before the outside went dark again.

Once again, I ran outside, rifle in hand, but this time the man was gone completely, without a trace.

Immediately, I confronted the cops in their useless cars, demanding they help search the area. They dared to seem annoyed with me as we searched the woods in the pouring rain.

Finding nothing, the officers returned to their vehicles. By this point, it was around 4 in the morning, and the storm began to let up. Against my better judgment, I allowed myself rest.

I awoke to sunshine and birds singing, a stunning contrast to the previous night.

Stepping onto my porch, in place of a gift, I found dozens of Polaroids of myself arranged into the shape of a butterfly.

Right in the center of the collage, I found something that broke me.

My daughter, laughing as I pushed her on the swing. As happy as could be.

25 years ago, she had gone missing from our front yard as my wife and I worked around the house.

Her disappearance broke me and my wife apart, and we divorced soon after, leading me to move here, into this cabin.

I felt my heart break all over again, and I began to break down. I was absolutely grimaced to find that the police cars were no longer at the end of my driveway and were nowhere to be found.

I lost my mind. I stomped through the forest screaming at the top of my lungs for the man to reveal himself, for him to show himself to me, and to stop being such a coward.

The forest had grown silent again, aside from the sound of leaves rustling around me. The noise surrounded me as if something were running in circles around me, studying me. I couldn’t even discern where it ended, but when it did, it was immediately replaced with a single sound:

click

My shroud of sanity fell, and I fired shots wildly in all directions. I listened as the unnaturally fast footsteps raced off deeper into the forest, laughing like a banshee.

This was the last I saw of the man for a while. DNA evidence from the earrings came back as a match for 36 different missing children from the 80s and 90s. This time, a whole team came up to my little cabin and searched extensively for miles.

Unbelievably, a warrant was served for the search of the cabin itself, which I obliged, too tired to care.

The search went on for months, and nothing was found. I’d stare at the pictures of the man, naked on my trail camera, and burning hatred filled my heart. Murderous resentment that would keep me awake at night.

The last gift the man has left me was his box from the first Polaroid he ever gave me.

A traveler’s trunk that you’d see on a train, across the top, the phrase “All the pretty things.”

I opened it to find dozens of doll heads along with dismembered arms and legs made from hollow plastic. I found a variety of clothing, all with butterflies stitched into the fabric. But above all, I found pictures of dozens of little girls, none older than 12.

Blood speckled the top of the pile, and I wanted to throw up, staring into the case.

I kneeled there over the box, completely lost for words and in a trance for what felt like hours. The one thing that snapped me out of this state was when I heard the rustling of leaves off in the distance, followed by a sound that broke me:

1qhz1lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1qhz1lj/six_driveins_and_a_yorkie/,Six Drive-Ins and a Yorkie,"Colt had been trying to keep things low-key ever since the Easter incident, when he’d accidentally referred to the resurrected Christ as a “zombie with a purpose” during a youth sermon. But this Sunday, as he sipped his third cup of church-lobby coffee and tried to dodge a second conversation about the volleyball league’s no-dunking policy, the older boys from the youth group cornered him.

“Yo, Brother Colt,” said Jaden, wearing a sleeveless hoodie that read HOLY GAINS. “We’re doing a Turbo Tots crawl today. You in?”

Colt blinked. “What’s… a Turbo Tots crawl?”

“You don’t know what a Turbo Tots crawl is? That’s a crazy L to take. One meal, six courses, at six different Turbo Tots drive-ins. We got it mapped: drinks, apps, chicken, burgers, mystery round, dessert. It’s like a pub crawl, but with tater tots.”

“Also it’s a ministry opportunity,” added Tyler, whose only spiritual gift was speed-eating footlong chili dogs.

Colt scratched his chin. He was technically off the clock, but this might, on paper, qualify as discipleship.

“I’m driving,” Colt said, immediately regretting it.

Turbo Tots 1: Drinks.
Easy. Everyone got their signature beverage. Colt, trying to impress the boys, ordered a Blue Puddle with extra coconut and lime. It tasted like suntan lotion and regret.

Turbo Tots 2: Appetizers.
Jalapeño poppers, mozzarella sticks, and those weird pickle fries that taste like they were left behind by a traveling carnival. Tyler claimed he once baptized a guy in cherry limeade.

Turbo Tots 3: Chicken.
Things got messy. Jaden threw ranch packets at Brayden, who retaliated by snorting crushed ice and had a brain freeze so paralyzing that he could not defend against being farted on. Colt tried to give a devotion about the loaves and fishes but was interrupted when unintentionally hit in the face by a flying chicken tender.

Turbo Tots 4: Burgers.
Everyone got quiet. There was something sanctifying about eating a greasy double cheeseburger on the side of a regional highway while TobyMac played softly through a Bluetooth speaker.

Then came the fifth Turbo Tots stop of the afternoon. The mystery round. The mistake.

This location had been chosen solely for its convenience on the route to Turbo Tots 6, but there was no parking lot. Just a sign:

PARKING TEMPORARILY LOCATED IN PERSEPOLIS COUNTY PARKING GARAGE #4

“That doesn’t even make sense,” Colt muttered, shaking off his tetraphobia. “But signs don’t lie.”

Persepolis County Garage #4 was dim, low-ceilinged, and deeply un-Turbo Tots-like.

“Maybe it’s like… an urban Turbo Tots?” Jaden offered.

“What is an urban Turbo Tots?” Colt asked.

No one knew, that’s crazy. But they parked anyway.

They walked to Turbo Tots 5 for the mystery round: everyone ordered something blind and swapped through. Colt unwrapped a Frito chili pie burrito wrapped in tinfoil and bad decisions.

Back at the garage, bellies full of deep-fried ambiguity, Colt hit the key fob.

Nothing.

“Dude,” Brayden whispered. “Your car’s gone.”

Colt stared. It was still there; just one level down, nose-deep in a fresh, cartoonishly perfect hole in the concrete.

“Oh no,” Colt said softly. “This is exactly how my cousin’s wedding ended.”

A construction crew swarmed like ants.

“Not our fault,” said a guy in a hard hat labeled #1 Pawpaw. 

“Garage was built during the Carter administration. She was bound to give.”

Then Colt’s First Sergeant from his National Guard unit showed up, in the capacity of a County Sheriff’s Deputy. No one had called him.

“We’re doing a barbecue. Come by. Bring the youthlings.”

Colt asked how he was barbequing while clearly on duty. The First Sergeant did not answer.

This is how they ended up at a three-bedroom ranch conveniently next to Garage #4. The air smelled like mesquite and mild theological tension.

The First Sergeant’s wife, wearing a rhinestone hair claw and a turquoise cross necklace large enough to require a seatbelt, appeared holding a basket of teacup Yorkies.

“Pick one,” she said brightly. “They need Godly homes.”

Colt picked the one with an underbite and a limp. He named it Tribulation.

Tribulation wandered off during the cornhole tournament and was found yapping at a chain-link fence. The neighbor turned out to be Colt’s cousin Nathan, who wore cargo shorts for all of life’s occasions.

“Come see what I’m growing,” Nathan said, without otherwise acknowledging Colt or his teenaged crew.

In the greenhouse, Colt and the church bros saw vines drooping under the weight of tomatoes the size of pumpkins.

Colt reached toward one. It pulled back. The skin glowed. Veins of gold pulsed beneath the surface, like lightning trapped in fruit.

“They’re almost ready,” Nathan said.

“Ready for what?” Colt asked.

“For when the ground splits and the sky doesn’t answer. You’ll need seed then. Not noise. Not fear. Seed.”

Before Colt could reply, the tomato cracked open. Blinding, alive, humming.

Everything stopped. The mosquitoes. The wind. The Earth.

Only Tribulation moved, tail wagging like he’d passed a test he didn’t know he was taking.

“Did it just… sing?” Colt asked.

“I wouldn’t call it singing,” Nathan said. “More like… agricultural prophecy.”

Colt gently closed the tomato’s cracked skin like a book he wasn’t ready to read.

“Bro,” Jaden whispered, “we just found the fruit of the Spirit.”

Brayden crossed himself, which made no theological sense, but Colt let it slide.

“Do you have more of these?” Colt asked.

Nathan didn’t answer. He opened a chest freezer in the corner of the greenhouse. Inside, nestled between two frozen lasagnas and what looked like a raccoon skull wrapped in butcher paper, were six vacuum-sealed tomato slices, each glowing faintly.

“Emergency seed.”

""Respect."" Tyler, still sucking on the last of his dessert slush, nodded.

Suddenly, the First Sergeant shouted “time for spiritual charades!”

The Yorkies were dressed as the Twelve Minor Prophets. Colt’s was given a tiny name tag: NAHUM. He decided to go with it.

--------------------------‐-------‐---------------------------------------

That night, Colt sat on a porch swing with Tribulation… or Nahum… on his lap, watching the stars, fiddling with a complimentary I Brake for Tots! bumper sticker for a car he no longer had, and wondering if his insurance covered artificial sinkholes.

Two weeks ago, I was pulling a cart through the local history section when I noticed a shelf I had never seen before. No label. No call numbers. Just a row of thin hardcovers, all identical, all gray.

The titles were names. Regular names. First and last. No subtitles.

I assumed someone dumped self-published memoirs in the wrong place. I pulled one down. Inside was a full biography. Childhood photos. High school clubs. College majors. Jobs. Spouses. Kids. It read like a very detailed obituary written years too early.

The copyright date was next year.

The last chapter was labeled Cause of Death.

I checked another book. Then another. Every person lived in our city. Addresses I recognized. Schools I knew. One book mentioned a wreck on the highway close to the library. Another described a heart attack in a grocery store.

I brought one to the front desk and asked my supervisor if we had a new collection. She flipped through it, frowned, and asked where I found it. When I pointed back there, she told me there was no such shelf and asked if I was feeling okay.

The shelf was gone when we checked.

I couldn’t stop thinking about one name I saw. A guy about my age. Same neighborhood. Same gym. Same coffee shop.

Yesterday, curiosity got the better of me. I searched his name online.

He exists. Social media, LinkedIn, everything. Still alive.

I remember his last chapter clearly. Construction delay. Flash flooding. A river overflow.

This morning, my phone lit up with a weather alert. Heavy storms expected tonight. Flood warnings along the river.

I don’t know if the shelf will come back. I don’t know why I saw it.

Today I went to grind size 10(!) on this grinder which is basically flirting with cold brew territory. Still choking, still not draining. At 4:50 the cone was almost full and I just removed it.

Water temp 92C. Tried 85C just to see extremes. No change.

Paper is standard bleached Hario 01.

Roast date is October 2025. Received at day 10. First brew at day 21. Now in month 3 and I’ve retried brewing weekly.

Extra data point that may matter: My husband ordered this exact coffee as a V60 in one of their shops. It took the baristas 15 minutes to brew it. He watched them literally dig into the slurry with teaspoons to force it to drain. Why he still bought me a bag of it, I will never know. I’m now suspecting he fancied one of the baristas because there’s literally no other explanation.

I have brewed probably 70+ different coffees on this setup. Never seen anything behave like this.

So the actual question is: what, chemically and physically, would cause a coffee that is now basically almost ground for cold brew to still choke?

Is this likely a roast issue? Cell structure shattered, producing massive fines even at coarse settings? Some weird natural processing thing? Or am I missing an obvious variable that my brain has decided to ignore?

I gave up on drinking this a long time ago. Now I’m just running experiments out of spite.

I recently bought a DF54 to complete my setup, along with a Breville Barista Max (until now I've been using the built-in grinder).

I'm having a lot of trouble getting a balanced latte or espresso, something I used to achieve easily with the built-in grinder.

My latte cups are 180 ml. My recipe used to be 18 grams with a 1:2 ratio, divided between two cups (18 grams of final solution per cup), and then I'd add milk or drink it as espresso, depending on the day.

Since getting the DF54, both preparations have been coming out bitter. Today, for example, I extracted 36 grams in 22 seconds, which theoretically shouldn't indicate over-extraction, but the taste is bitter even with milk.

I've tried various dial settings, from 10 to 15, and even under-extracting, getting 36 grams in 18 seconds, but it still tastes bitter.

What am I doing wrong? The only thing that's changed in my recipe is the grinder, but in theory it's BETTER than the one built into the Breville.

According to the chart, it's for a watery + bitter blend; should I extract less?

Thank you so much!",1,1768909468.0,espresso,9,1.0,False

1qhywdz,https://v.redd.it/58ua50sirheg1,Rate my shot – looking for more sweetness [la marzocco linea mini r / Fiorenzato all ground sense],"Hi everyone,

I’d love some feedback on my current espresso dial-in and what you’d try next.

Coffee: Playground Coffee Zima (Mid roast – Brazil / Guatemala / Ethiopia)
Machine: La Marzocco Linea Mini R
Brew temp: 94 °C
Grinder: Fiorenzato AllGround Sense
Basket: VST 18 g

Recipe:
	•	18.5 g in
	•	37 g out (≈1:2)
	•	33 s extraction

Prep:
	•	WDT
	•	Leveler
	•	Precision tamper

Taste:
	•	First impression: slightly bitter
	•	Acidity is well integrated
	•	From sip to sip it actually gets more enjoyable

When I go for longer ratios (e.g. ~1:2.3), the shot starts running very watery toward the end, but the overall flavor is slightly better and less bitter.

Question:
What would you optimize next to get more sweetness and reduce bitterness?
Shorter ratio? Lower dose? Temperature adjustment?

Also… if I go one click coarser on my grinder, the extraction time drops by ~10 seconds, and the shot is basically done in ~23 s (wtf?). So fine-tuning via grind size feels pretty brutal right now.

I recently reconnected with my ex. We’re back in contact, we text (not constantly, but regularly), he’s not dry, he initiates sometimes, he’s called me when he saw me in public, we grabbed coffee before, and he even came over to my place recently — we talked for hours and were comfortable enough to just lie on my bed and talk. From an outside perspective, it really doesn’t look like someone who has completely moved on.
He did tell me honestly that he went out with one girl once but said it went nowhere and that he likes being single right now. That part really triggered me.
The issue isn’t so much him — it’s my mind.
I’ve been stuck in this intense fear that he’s going to replace me or find someone else, even though there’s no concrete evidence of that happening right now. My brain keeps jumping to worst-case future scenarios (like imagining him having a girlfriend by summer when we’re supposed to work together), and I get physical anxiety from it — chest tightness, panic, crying.
I also got really caught up in manifestation / “law of assumption” content, which honestly made things worse. I started believing that my fears could cause reality, so every negative thought felt dangerous. I became hyper-aware of my mind, constantly checking if I’m “believing the wrong thing,” worrying I’ve already messed things up or that it’s “too late” because I’ve been afraid for so long.
What confuses me the most is that:
Reality shows signs of connection and interest
My fear says “ignore that, he’ll still find someone else”
I don’t want to believe that fear, but it keeps looping
I keep asking myself:
How do I know what I truly believe vs what I’m just afraid of?
Can fear really “create” outcomes, or am I just anxious?
Am I sabotaging something by being scared, or am I just dealing with attachment anxiety?
I feel exhausted, confused, and scared of repeating past pain. I don’t want reassurance that “everything will work out” — I just want to know if this sounds like anxiety / anxious attachment, or if I’m missing something obvious.

1qhytvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1qhytvh/best_vpns_for_paraguay/,Best VPNs for Paraguay,"Your ISP in Paraguay is watching. Every site you visit, every video you stream, every download—they're logging it all. And while Paraguay doesn't have China-level censorship, that doesn't mean your privacy is protected.

I've tested dozens of VPNs from Asunción to see which ones actually work for Paraguayan users. The good news? You don't need to hand over your browsing data. The right VPN encrypts your connection, hides your activity from prying eyes, and unlocks international content that's otherwise blocked.

✅ **Quick Answer:** **NordVPN** is the best VPN for Paraguay, offering 8,900+ servers in 129 countries, blazing-fast NordLynx speeds, and rock-solid encryption starting at just $3.39/month. For budget-conscious users, **Surfshark** delivers unlimited device connections and solid performance at $1.99/month.

# Why Paraguay Needs VPNs (More Than You Think)

Paraguay's internet is relatively free compared to neighbors like Venezuela or Cuba. There's no Great Firewall blocking Facebook or Netflix. But that doesn't mean you're browsing privately.

Here's what's actually happening:

**ISPs track everything.** Your internet service provider keeps complete logs of your online activity. Where you go, what you watch, how long you stay—it's all recorded. No law prevents them from doing this.

**Streaming geo-blocks are real.** Try watching BBC iPlayer or accessing the full US Netflix library from Paraguay. You can't. Content providers detect your Paraguayan IP and block you instantly.

**Public WiFi is a security nightmare.** Coffee shops, airports, hotels—every public network is a hacker's playground. Without encryption, anyone on the same network can intercept your passwords, banking details, and personal messages.

**Journalists face pressure.** Self-censorship is common in Paraguay, especially in border areas where criminal groups and corrupt officials threaten reporters. A VPN provides the anonymity needed to investigate and publish safely.

|Privacy Threat|Risk Level|VPN Protection|

|ISP Activity Logging|High|🔒 Complete|
|Geo-Restricted Content|Medium|🔒 Complete|
|Public WiFi Hacking|High|🔒 Complete|
|Government Surveillance|Medium|🔒 Strong|

# The 3 Best VPNs for Paraguay (Tested from Asunción)

I tested these VPNs specifically for Paraguay's internet conditions—speed, server availability, streaming performance, and security. These aren't just ""good VPNs."" They're the ones that actually work here.

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall VPN for Paraguay

**Price:** $3.39/month (2-year plan) | **Servers:** 8,900+ in 129 countries | **Devices:** 10 simultaneous

NordVPN dominates. I've used it from Asunción for two years, and the performance is consistently excellent. The NordLynx protocol (based on WireGuard) delivers speeds that actually feel faster than my unprotected connection on some servers.

**What Makes NordVPN Stand Out:**

The **NordLynx protocol** is the secret weapon. Traditional VPNs slow you down—sometimes by 40-50%. NordLynx? I measured only a 5-10% speed drop when connecting to nearby servers in Brazil and Argentina. That's basically nothing.

**Threat Protection** blocks ads, malware, and trackers automatically. No more annoying pop-ups on sketchy streaming sites or accidentally downloading malware disguised as a movie file.

**Double VPN** routes your traffic through two servers for maximum anonymity. Overkill for most people, but if you're a journalist investigating corruption or need serious privacy, it's there.

**Real-World Performance from Paraguay:**

I ran speed tests connecting from Asunción to servers in São Paulo, Buenos Aires, and Miami. Here's what I got:

* **São Paulo, Brazil:** 195 Mbps download (from 220 Mbps baseline) — 11% speed loss
* **Buenos Aires, Argentina:** 188 Mbps download — 15% speed loss
* **Miami, USA:** 142 Mbps download — 35% speed loss

Those numbers are impressive. Distant servers always slow down more, but NordVPN keeps performance strong even to the US.

**Streaming Performance:**

Netflix works perfectly with NordVPN. I tested US, UK, and Brazilian libraries—all unblocked instantly. Disney+ and Max streamed in HD with zero buffering. Even BBC iPlayer, which aggressively blocks VPNs, loaded without issues.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Connect to the São Paulo server for the best balance of speed and international content access. It's close enough for minimal latency but gets you outside Paraguay's ISP logging.

**What I Don't Like:**

The **monthly price is steep** at $12.99. You really need to commit to the 2-year plan ($3.39/month) to get value. Also, the **Linux app is functional but clunky** compared to Windows and Mac versions.

**Best For:** Users who want maximum speed, verified security, and reliable streaming without compromises.

# 2. Surfshark – Best Budget VPN with Unlimited Devices

**Price:** $1.99/month (2-year plan) | **Servers:** 4,500+ in 100 countries | **Devices:** Unlimited

Surfshark is stupid cheap for what you get. At $1.99/month, it costs less than a coffee in Asunción—but you can protect every device you own simultaneously. Got five phones, three laptops, and two tablets? Connect them all.

**Why Surfshark Works for Paraguay:**

**Unlimited device connections** is the killer feature. Most VPNs cap you at 5-10 devices. Surfshark doesn't care. Install it on everything.

**CleanWeb 2.0** blocks ads and malware just like NordVPN's Threat Protection. I've used it for months and haven't seen a single pop-up ad on streaming sites.

**NoBorders Mode** helps bypass restrictive networks. If you're traveling to Argentina or Brazil and hit VPN blocks, NoBorders often gets through.

**Speed Testing from Paraguay:**

Surfshark is fast, though not quite NordVPN-level. Here's what I measured:

* **São Paulo, Brazil:** 178 Mbps download (from 220 Mbps baseline) — 19% speed loss
* **Buenos Aires, Argentina:** 171 Mbps download — 22% speed loss
* **Miami, USA:** 128 Mbps download — 42% speed loss

Still excellent for HD streaming and torrenting. You won't notice any lag unless you're obsessed with speed tests.

**Streaming and Torrenting:**

Netflix, Disney+, and Max all work flawlessly. I tested 10+ regional Netflix libraries—US, UK, Canada, Brazil—and every single one loaded instantly. BBC iPlayer worked on the first try.

Torrenting is fully supported on all servers. I downloaded a 4GB Linux ISO in under 10 minutes through a São Paulo server.

⚠️ **Warning:** The **renewal price jumps to $59.76/year** after your first term. That's still affordable, but it's nearly triple the intro rate. Set a reminder before renewal.

**What's Missing:**

The **server count is lower** than NordVPN (4,500 vs 8,900), which can matter during peak hours. Some servers felt congested in the evenings.

**Best For:** Families or anyone with multiple devices who wants premium VPN protection without the premium price.

# 3. CyberGhost – Best VPN for Streaming from Paraguay

**Price:** $2.19/month (2-year plan) | **Servers:** 11,500+ in 100 countries | **Devices:** 7 simultaneous

CyberGhost has one thing no other VPN can match: **dedicated streaming servers** that are optimized specifically for Netflix, Disney+, Max, and BBC iPlayer. These aren't just random servers—they're maintained to unblock specific platforms.

**What Makes CyberGhost Special:**

The **streaming server menu is beautifully simple.** Instead of guessing which US server works with Netflix, you just select ""Optimized for Netflix US"" and connect. It works every time.

**11,500+ servers** means you'll always find a fast, uncongested connection. Even during peak hours in Paraguay, I never experienced slowdowns.

**45-day money-back guarantee** is the longest in the industry. Most VPNs give you 30 days. CyberGhost gives you 45.

**Speed Performance:**

CyberGhost's speeds are solid but inconsistent. Some servers are blazing fast, others are... okay.

* **São Paulo, Brazil:** 192 Mbps download — 13% speed loss
* **Buenos Aires, Argentina:** 165 Mbps download — 25% speed loss
* **Miami, USA:** 118 Mbps download — 46% speed loss

The variability can be annoying. If you connect to a slow server, just disconnect and try another.

**Streaming is Where CyberGhost Shines:**

I tested every major platform:

* Netflix US, UK, Canada, Brazil: ✅ All worked perfectly
* Disney+ Paraguay and US: ✅ Flawless HD streaming
* Max: ✅ No issues
* BBC iPlayer: ✅ Loaded instantly
* Amazon Prime Video: ✅ No blocks detected

🎯 **Bottom Line:** If streaming international content is your primary reason for getting a VPN, CyberGhost delivers the smoothest experience.

**The Downsides:**

**Only 7 simultaneous connections.** If you have a large family, this might not be enough.

The **apps can feel cluttered.** Settings are scattered across multiple menus, which is confusing at first.

# How to Choose a VPN for Paraguay: What Actually Matters

Forget marketing fluff. Here's what you should actually care about when picking a VPN in Paraguay.

# 1. Nearby Server Locations

**Why it matters:** The farther your VPN server, the slower your connection. Physics.

**What to look for:** Servers in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. These are close enough to Paraguay for minimal speed loss.

All three VPNs I recommend have strong South American coverage. NordVPN has 100+ servers in São Paulo alone.

# 2. WireGuard Protocol Support

**Why it matters:** WireGuard is 3-4x faster than older OpenVPN protocol while maintaining the same security level.

**What to look for:** VPNs that support WireGuard or a WireGuard-based protocol (like NordVPN's NordLynx).

Older protocols like PPTP and L2TP are basically worthless. If a VPN still uses these as primary options, skip it.

# 3. No-Logs Policy (Actually Audited)

**Why it matters:** A VPN that logs your activity is worse than no VPN at all.

**What to look for:** Independent audits from Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, or similar firms. Marketing claims don't count.

All three of my recommendations have been audited:

* **NordVPN:** 5+ independent audits
* **Surfshark:** 3 audits
* **CyberGhost:** 2 Deloitte audits

# 4. Streaming Capability

**Why it matters:** If Netflix detects your VPN and blocks you, what's the point?

**What to look for:** VPNs that specifically maintain streaming servers and regularly update IPs.

CyberGhost leads here with dedicated streaming servers. NordVPN and Surfshark both work excellently too.

# 5. Kill Switch (Non-Negotiable)

**Why it matters:** If your VPN connection drops, your real IP address gets exposed unless a kill switch blocks all traffic.

**What to look for:** Automatic kill switch that activates without manual setup.

All three VPNs include this, but always enable it in settings to be safe.

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** Never pay monthly rates for a VPN. The 2-year plans are 70-85% cheaper. If you're unsure, use the 30-day money-back guarantee to test it risk-free.

# How to Use a VPN in Paraguay (Step-by-Step)

Getting started is easier than you think. Here's the process:

**Step 1: Choose Your VPN**

* For maximum speed and security: **NordVPN** ($3.39/month)
* For unlimited devices and budget: **Surfshark** ($1.99/month)
* For dedicated streaming: **CyberGhost** ($2.19/month)

**Step 2: Subscribe and Download** Click the provider's website, select the 2-year plan for the best price, and create an account. Download the app for your device (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux).

**Step 3: Install and Connect** Open the app, sign in, and connect to a nearby server. São Paulo or Buenos Aires work best for speed. Miami works great for US content.

**Step 4: Verify Your Connection** Visit [ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net) to confirm your IP address shows the VPN server location, not Paraguay. If it does, you're protected.

**Step 5: Enable Auto-Connect and Kill Switch** In settings, turn on ""Auto-connect on startup"" and ""Kill switch."" This ensures you're always protected, even if you forget.

⚡ **Performance Insight:** If you notice slower speeds, try switching protocols. WireGuard (or NordLynx) is almost always faster than OpenVPN.

# Streaming from Paraguay: What Works

Here's what I tested from Asunción with each VPN:

|Platform|Available in Paraguay|VPN Unblocks|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Netflix Paraguay**|✅ Yes|No VPN needed|
|**Netflix US**|❌ Blocked|✅ All 3 VPNs|
|**Disney+ Paraguay**|✅ Yes|No VPN needed|
|**Disney+ US**|❌ Blocked|✅ All 3 VPNs|
|**Max**|✅ Yes|No VPN needed|
|**BBC iPlayer**|❌ Blocked|✅ All 3 VPNs|
|**Amazon Prime**|✅ Yes|No VPN needed|
|**Hulu**|❌ Blocked|✅ All 3 VPNs|

Netflix, Disney+, and Max are all officially available in Paraguay, but the content libraries are smaller than US or UK versions. A VPN lets you access the full catalogs.

# VPN Myths Debunked (Stop Believing These)

**Myth 1: ""Free VPNs are good enough.""** No. They're terrible. Free VPNs make money by selling your browsing data—the exact thing you're trying to protect. They also have slow speeds, data caps, and weak security.

**Myth 2: ""VPNs slow your internet to a crawl.""** Not with modern protocols. WireGuard-based VPNs like NordVPN and Surfshark have minimal speed impact (5-15% on nearby servers).

**Myth 3: ""VPNs make you 100% anonymous.""** They don't. VPNs hide your IP and encrypt traffic, but if you log into Facebook or Gmail, you're still identifiable. VPNs protect your privacy, not anonymity.

**Myth 4: ""All VPNs are the same.""** Absolutely not. Cheap VPNs often log your data, leak your IP, or sell your bandwidth to third parties. Stick with verified providers.

# Final Verdict: Which VPN Should You Get?

After months of testing from Paraguay, here's my honest recommendation:

**Get NordVPN if:** You want the absolute best performance, fastest speeds, and strongest security. The extra $1.40/month over Surfshark is worth it for the NordLynx protocol and verified audits.

**Get Surfshark if:** You have multiple devices or a tight budget. Unlimited connections and $1.99/month pricing make it unbeatable for families.

**Get CyberGhost if:** Streaming is your main priority. The dedicated servers make unblocking Netflix, Disney+, and BBC iPlayer effortless.

Can't decide? Start with **NordVPN.** It's the best all-rounder for Paraguay, and the 30-day money-back guarantee means you can test it risk-free. If you don't like it, switch to Surfshark or CyberGhost.

1qhys1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypartneristrans/comments/1qhys1f/aitah_my_wife_isnt_coming_to_my_sisters_hen/,AITAH: my wife isn’t coming to my sister’s hen celebrations,"My little sister (34f) is getting married this year after being with her boyfriend for 17 years and raising 2 kids together. It’s well overdue so there are lots of celebrations, including three hen events being organised by my other sister (37f). Me (45f) and my wife (44 mtf) have been invited to all the hen events.

We were both nervous when it was all announced. My family have been the best through my wife’s transition (her own family did a runner) but even still we weren’t sure exactly what would happen when it came to these invites. Wife being invited to everything meant the world and was brilliant. Both my sisters were adamant that it wouldn’t have been any other way. They are fab.

But: Wife isn’t going to come to any of them. The events are all going to be very cis and heteronormative, and involve a lot of drinking and being in places we don’t know at weird times. We’ve kept ourselves safe by not exposing ourselves to this sort of environment over the last few years. And honestly it suits me better this way; I have chronic conditions and neurodivergence that mean I find them hard anyway, without the threat of being hate-crimed.

So, we communicated to my sisters that Wife wouldn’t be coming, but that we really valued both being invited. If wife stays home then I know I can go to everything but that she will be refreshed and able to care for me when I’m exhausted afterwards. It means our dog is cared for, costs less (we live on my income at the moment), and we can offer child care for my sisters. And importantly to us it means my sister’s long overdue hen celebrations won’t be overshadowed by us being sad/hurt because of abuse from strangers. We suggested making time for a celebratory coffee or lunch sometime instead, as long as she could fit us in.

The girls are annoyed and upset. We keep getting things like “we know we’ll never know exactly what it’s like to be her, but with a group of us to defend her she’ll be fine” and “you’re not the only gay people out there you know, you’ll always feel scared till you just go out and do it”… I don’t think they realise just how much we internalise the pain of these interactions. Every time we’ve been out in our small town later than 9pm we’ve been shouted or at least stared at and whispered about. It’s exhausting.

So, am I, or are we, the asshole? But less dramatically than that, have I missed something that I should be taking into account? I’m sure the girls will get over it, but is there anything I can do to help them understand? Any thoughts or opinions welcome!

Short version: my trans wife has been invited to three hen events for my sister but has gently declined. Sister is upset.

After some posts here and in r/beckhoff, I thought it might make sense to build up a thread, where everybody can share their knowledge of the topic.

I'll keep this post up to date with all your notes in the comments. This way we can use this as a central hub for all EtherCAT issues.

# Typical errors:

**1. Data is missing sporadically**

This error can show in different ways. Maybe you are watching your process data cyclically and see twice the exactly same value directly one after the other. Or you are even using the different diagnosis data and see the errors this way. Or perhaps you sporadically have that many issues that your NC throws the error 0x4466 Invalid I/O data for more than 3 continuous NC cycles. Whatever it is, the diagnosis is typically the same:

The CRCs can be used for the spatial classification of a bus fault. Each CRC then stands for a checksum error at a port (A-B-C-D).

https://preview.redd.it/jfc4rdsojheg1.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=bccdd31a39f09ccb668ae12d07ce908c5eb83829

Port A is always the EtherCAT-In port. The other naming might change per slave. Check the documentation if you are unsure. Here is an example for the EK1122:

https://preview.redd.it/s331qupkkheg1.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1f7affd589369ed8c2f3b2ee217c86ecb8b48e3

Keep in mind the order in which the ports are handled. It's for all EtherCAT Slaves the same: A → D → B → C. It's important because when using the CRCs, you should always go according to the Port order.

If you find slaves with increasing CRCs, the root cause might be:

1. broken cable
2. EMC issues
3. power supply limitations
4. defect slave devices

There are some additional tools you can use for the diagnosis:

In the Advanced settings of the EtherCAT device, you can enable additional registers to be shown. I typically enable those 3.

https://preview.redd.it/3rnly2udlheg1.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=45335bb97e3e637e5a5b7409f700546eccc51d85

Link Lost .. is pretty self-explanatory. It counts the number of link losses. Every so often those showed me stuff, the normal CRCs weren't able to.

In addition, the state change counters show you, how often the state has been changed. You get 2 counters per slave, and by default it should be ""0 / 1"".

If the connection to a slave is lost, the right-hand counter will count up. This way you can easily identify connection issues, even if they are very sporadic. The left-hand side counter will show you “software-caused” state changes. Which means, if the AX5000 goes into SafeOP because of synchronization issues. This is less interesting for the sporadic communication issues, but still an interesting counter to have a look at.

Another great tool can be the Emergency Scan. It will send out a number of frames to each slave separately. If we have hardware issue, they could be well diagnosed with this tool. Just be patient. I would always run this with 1000 frames, but the window will freeze. Just be patient and grab a cup of coffee once you start it. It will not crash. Just give it some time.

https://preview.redd.it/nds1nyy8mheg1.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=5168e314fc965d674fe1cfc8a995e0fb1b4a3f5e

One other thing will be the power supply. This is typically one of the worst to diagnose. One tip I can give you is: Check the E-Bus current in TwinCAT. I have seen so many systems in the past, where TwinCAT already showed -100mA to even -500mA. The most fascinating thing is: it worked for a long time. But at some point we needed to put in a new e-bus-power supply, like the EL9410.

For EMC, some guides I like to reference from Beckhoff are

[https://download.beckhoff.com/download/Document/io/ethercat-terminals/ethernetcabling\_en.pdf](https://download.beckhoff.com/download/Document/io/ethercat-terminals/ethernetcabling_en.pdf)

**2. All slaves are in SafeOP and the Master in OP**

  
This has been a topic multiple times in this subreddit. Typically, the systems have some kind of dongle licence active.

https://preview.redd.it/makttzsfnheg1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd020aa107abfc66010bbced60bddd1de5ddfde0

When the I/O licence is a dongle licence, it will not just go into missing and throw an error. Instead, it will go into “pending dongle” state. Which means, the slaves go up to SafeOP and wait for validation of the licence. It just never happens.

Therefore, check your licence folder on your target. Check your project, if there is a dongle device configured. 

**3. A specific slave won't go into OP or always falls back to other states**

In EtherCAT, when a slave doesn't follow the masters requested state (typically OP), it will throw an error about why it doesn't do that.

TwinCAT will show you the error in the error messages in TwinCAT XAE or you can find them in the OS's event logs.

Those error codes are AL status codes, you can find documented here:

# Other guides

An official guide I can recommend having a look into, is the User guide from the ETG (EtherCAT Technology Group):

[https://www.ethercat.org/download/documents/EtherCAT\_Diagnosis\_For\_Users.pdf](https://www.ethercat.org/download/documents/EtherCAT_Diagnosis_For_Users.pdf)

And of course, the training from Beckhoff was also very helpful in understanding more all this stuff. So if your company can provide you a training and your local subsidiary offers it, I would fully recommend it.

My question is, how hard will it be for me, someone with no prior experience of wood working, to make something like this?

I have a mitre saw, a sander, a drill, hammer, etc. Is there anything else I might need - tools wise?

I have experience crafting with foam and worbla crafting huge fake weapons and armour, as well as working with furniture already built (sanding, painting, finishing) and I have all these tools already from a DIY house renovation so I'm not completely clueless I've just never, ever worked with wood before.

# Prologue: Professor B.S.

Professor B.S. suffered from eternal insomnia. He sat before his television screen, far too alert.

**3:21.**

An interesting hour. Even more so when read in reverse. A basketball game murmured in the background, entirely irrelevant.

B.S. was contemplating the critical ethics of eating during a lecture. Not the students eating; that was perfectly legitimate in his eyes. He was thinking about the lecturer eating, mid-presentation. Nothing heavy, like beef and potatoes. Something light. A pleasant little salad. Perhaps a can of something carbonated on the side. But the students might take offense. The pretentious ones would likely file a complaint with the faculty.

*Ridiculous. It’s for their own benefit,* B.S. mused.

It would allow him to survive the mid-lecture hypoglycemia and bring the entire performance to a crescendo.

Perhaps he could bring in a patient while he was at it. Well, at least an actor. He could demonstrate meningeal signs on them - bend the neck until they screamed their soul out in pain.

Unpleasant.

Meningitis is undeniably unpleasant. Fortunately, only the actor must suffer.

Professor B.S. considered breaking his routine tomorrow to perform a ward round. A 'Peacock Walk,' just to remind everyone he was still among the living. Perhaps he would bark at someone regarding a botched chest X-ray interpretation, or, more amusingly, offer a rare word of praise to the department’s most incompetent resident. It was always good for a laugh.

The mere thought caused a twitch in his left flank. Or his right. Or both. Dealing with the actual practice of medicine was a dangerous business. Too demanding. Better to stick to lectures and remain entombed in his office. The air conditioning was sublime this time of year. Airy weather.

It was already four in the morning. Not good; sleep was no longer an option. Better to get dressed and brew some coffee. The morning would arrive soon enough.

# Chapter 1 – Beep. Beep. Beep.

**Beep. Beep. Beep.**

White noise.

**Beep. Beep. Beep.**

White noise.

Dr. Eran Datner, the miserable resident on duty in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at 'Sharona' Hospital, glanced at his watch. 3:23. A digital watch. A toy for the new generation. He disliked the time staring back at him, something too symmetrical about it. Either too early to get up or far too late.

In any case, he wondered why he had woken up. The background drone of the monitors was a poor excuse. It was barely audible from behind the on-call room door in the NICU. It must be something else.

**Ring. Ring. Ring.**

The phone. The nurse Susan. Susan Schell.

That never meant anything good.

That American only spoke up to rant about vaccines or bark about resuscitation.

**Resuscitation**.

He leapt out of bed, nearly forgetting to put on his shoes, and bolted from the room. His thinning hair was disheveled, and he was wholly dazed and bewildered. He did not know what awaited him.

\*\*\*

Datner nearly stumbled over the nurses' desk before truly opening his eyes. He felt sour. Like a lemon squeezed into a margarita that had sat in the sun for far too long.

He knew what he had to do.

Too late.

Washing his face now would make the nurses look at him strangely. Combing his hair was out of the question; he had never owned a comb (he knew he did not have much to comb anyway). It was time for action.

Room 11.

The resuscitation in Room 11.

Susan had said it explicitly, that unhinged American from hell.

*Too harsh. Just an unhinged American, then. Still tough, though. American, the harshest curse of all.*

**Resuscitation**.

He pulled back the curtain of Room 11.

\*\*\*

A large incubator. Transparent. Horribly generic.

The baby was unmistakably **blue**.

It had a name, but no one cared about that at this stage. At this stage, it wasn't even clear what the baby’s sex was. A few things were clear to Datner now. The monitor above the incubator showed a low oxygen saturation of 76%, and the baby looked distinctly blue.

The pulse and blood pressure were not being read by the monitor, and there were too many nurses around the small incubator. At least three nurses. At least one of them was Susan Schell. That couldn't be good.

Worst of all, the incubator had not yet been opened. That really annoyed him.

He pushed his way past the flustered nurses, opened the incubator, and shouted at Susan - ""The Ambu, now."" He began ventilating. '*Not too hard,*' he recalled the advice of his old mentor, Prof. B.S., '*Gently, so you don’t burst the baby’s lungs.*'

The lungs, surprisingly, did not resist at all. The air pushed by the Ambu flowed easily into the small body, which gradually turned pinker and pinker.

""What are the blood pressure and pulse?"" Datner called out into the air, stifling a small smile at the saturation rising to 99%. *Even better than 100, better symmetry*. The sound the monitor emitted became much more tolerable. Almost melodic. Harmonic. *The Beach Boys* at their peak. *God Only Knows*.

""Still not reading,"" a voice from outer space replied.

That alien irritated Datner.

""Bring me a tube, size 2.5. And a laryngoscope with a small blade,"" he practically grumbled, disappointed by the slow flow of the event.

He did not fail to notice that Susan was working flawlessly. With all her faults, she was still quite experienced. She handed him the laryngoscope and the tube.

He put down the Ambu and inserted the laryngoscope.

'*Straight up at a right angle. With the patient’s eyes facing the ceiling,*' he recalled another piece of advice from Prof. B.S. Advice for all time. A Man for all seasons.

He wondered where B.S. was now.

Probably sitting at home watching TV and getting annoyed about his low salary. Who watches TV at this hour? Is the man a psychopath?!

Never mind. Moving on.

The vocal cords were clearly visible. A piece of cake. He inserted the tube quickly. Now, fixation.

This was the part he hated. He always felt the nurses would cause him to pull out the tube at that moment. Susan, however, didn't panic. ""At 9.5 centimeters, Doctor?"" she asked, almost affectionately.

""Yes,"" he mumbled, slightly surprised by her positive approach. He connected the Ambu to the tube and squeezed gently, compressing the small bellows only slightly, so as not to burst the lungs.

Meanwhile, the pulse returned. Approximately.

The monitor showed something that looked approximately like an ECG tracing in Lead 2. Not quite.

*The stickers! They had fallen off the baby’s chest. Nurse Miri was attaching them now. Other than that, she was useless. She should learn from Susan.*

Pulse 150. A small smile.

""And blood pressure?"" Datner almost whispered.

""Wait, I'm changing the cuff, the previous one is too big,"" Susan answered. He *almost* began to like her. Not really, but still, a little, given the situation and the alternatives. Better unhinged and efficient than sane and harmful.

Another half a minute passed. Thirty seconds is a long time when you are waiting. He began to remember how tired he was. A big yawn. Overt. For everyone to see. The questionable scent of his breath forced him to stop the show. If you eat something after midnight, it’s best not to have it spicy or with a lot of garlic. Crucially, it's best not to have **both** ingredients, Datner noted. Failed note.

Meanwhile, the tube fixation was finished, and he turned to adjust the parameters on the ventilator. He never quite understood how to choose the numbers, the ventilation metrics. Strange names for pressures – ‘PIP’, ‘PEEP’, and all sorts of other 'peeps' ran through his head. He also had pressure in his bladder. A sudden need to urinate. Fortunately, he sorted that out relatively easily here. Almost a coincidence. Dumb luck.

""Blood pressure 60/30,"" Susan cried, almost shouted, in a tone of joy, into the space.

It won't get better than that, Datner decided.

He barely knew what to do with himself now that he was no longer holding the tube or calibrating the ventilator. Nurse Miri smiled. Like a calf that had been given excellent straw.

Nurse Susan was frowning. Despite her advanced age, something of the Southern American beauty in which she had once excelled remained. *The Texas beauty queen forty years ago, no doubt*. He didn't recall her being originally from New York.

""What about Dextro?"" Datner barked.

""Immediately, Doctor,"" Susan replied submissively. She clearly had excellent training and manners that were out of this world. Foreign to the place.

He almost decided to go out to the stairwell and steal a few puffs of a cigarette.

Maybe it is better to update the on-call physician first.

But first, read the chart, he concluded.

He knew nothing about the infant who had just returned to life and certainly didn't know why this delicate creature had nearly collapsed completely. The on-call physician would not like a call about resuscitation without concrete information about the patient. He wasn't even sure if it was a male. He thought he saw testes during the ventilation, but he wasn't prepared to swear to it.

Still, a cigarette first. The on-call physician was certainly asleep now, and there was no reason to rush and call her before everything was known.

The watch showed 3:53. Still too symmetrical.

\*\*\*

""What do you mean, the baby in Room 11 almost died?"" the voice on the other end gasped. Datner wasn't sure if Dr. Katya Pavlichuk, the on-call neonatologist, was shouting or talking in her sleep. Maybe it was a combination of both? And what difference did it make anyway?

""He was perfectly fine this morning when I left him,"" the on-call physician continued, starting to wake up, grumbling about the uninvited wake-up call and the news it brought.

Datner glanced at his watch, 5:15, still symmetrical.

He thought that if he waited long enough, the on-call physician would appreciate the extra sleep time he had allowed her, and it would slightly dull the criticism of his ignorance regarding the chart.

He had tried earlier to read a little in the record, but everything was written in a particularly sloppy handwriting, worse even than his own, and most days there wasn't even a visit note. Only nurses’ comments alongside growth metrics and medication logs.

He gathered it was an infant (it was, after all, a male, those indeed were testes), a **29-week preemie** who had been in the NICU for two weeks, receiving some **TPN** (total parenteral nutrition; nutrition through the vein. The 'T' standing for Total - meaning exclusive IV nutrition, although the baby had already started receiving some formula).

And that was it.

Most of the time, the baby had been idling and lying in the incubator between visits, however many of those were conducted.

This was exactly what the on-call physician, Dr. Katya Pavlichuk, was lecturing him about now.

Datner wasn't really listening. He knew the ways of senior neonatologists. She would dump everything at him, regardless. Better to keep quiet and scowl. Healthier for his coronaries.

After a few more seconds (about two hundred, in Datner's estimation, who had begun to develop a slight, involuntary twitch) of a lecture on the essence of life and the fact that the baby had been perfect that morning when she left, Dr. Katya finally got around to asking something. It sounded like a question. Datner wasn't really listening.

Hello, hello, Datner, are you there?!"" Katya shrieked.

""Yes, certainly,"" Datner replied.

He was entertaining thoughts of early retirement. Considering his age (33, well-balanced), his professional status (a pediatric resident in his third out of four years), and his family status (unhappily married with two daughters who were probably very nice, he didn't really know them), these were premature, idle thoughts.

""How is the baby now? Is he ventilated? Does he need inotropes? Did you take cultures? Did you replace the central line? Did you start antibiotics?""

This was roughly what Dr. Katya rattled off. Datner wasn't really sure he cared.

""The baby is fine, easily ventilated, no inotropes, and no antibiotics,"" he replied, trying to avoid revealing the fact that he had failed to insert a central line and hadn't managed to take more than one blood culture. As for urine and cerebrospinal fluid cultures, forget about it. Let the morning shift do that. They rested all night.

He didn't tell Dr. Katya all of that, of course. She hadn't asked specifically. A small, harmless white lie, in Datner's opinion. She said she would arrive in about two hours (funny, that was the usual time for the morning meeting anyway) and that until then, he should update her if there was anything new. Anything at all.

""Yes, of course,"" Datner answered in an authoritative tone, his thoughts were far less polite.

\*\*\*

Dr. Katya Pavlichuk thought life was once more beautiful. When she was a child, still in Moscow, she dreamed of becoming a doctor. A pediatrician. She had always been the best student in school, the best student in medical school. Until she arrived in Israel. Straight to 'Sharona'.

When she arrived in the country, they told her 'Sharona' Hospital was in the Sharon region, as the name suggests. 'Two minutes from Tel Aviv,' they said. That was a crude lie; the drive was at least thirty minutes from Tel Aviv, and that was only if you drove at night, with zero traffic. No less. It wasn't really in the Sharon either; it was more in the Coastal Plain. She wasn't sure, and anyway, there was no one to complain to. But that’s where they assigned her, and she, being the good girl she was, did as she was instructed.

That was over twenty years ago already. Like another lifetime.

She tried to feel like she belonged from the start, but they didn't exactly make it easy.

For the first time in her life, she wasn't the popular success. She would hear them mocking her strange accent behind her back. Funny, in her eyes, the Israelis at 'Sharona' had the diction of Orientals. Mongolians. Descendants of Genghis Khan. Almost Mongoloid, she thought, a word she knew she shouldn’t be using. She remembered someone once told her that Dr. Down was a vicious, consummate racist. He was the one who gave the name 'Mongoloid' to babies with three sets of chromosomes 21 and slanted eyes. A smart fellow. A great racist, like all puffed-up Brits, but smart. He probably had crooked teeth. All smart Brits had crooked teeth. Even the not-so-smart ones. And they were all racists.

Only Dr. Renana treated her nicely, back then, when she first arrived at 'Sharona'. They became better friends. Renana was still sometimes happy then. Until that incident.

Now, as a veteran, Katya had learned to live in 'Sharona'. She no longer tried to excel. Excellence at 'Sharona' meant a death blow. A sign on your back. A mark of Cain.

She got out of bed and walked toward the bathroom. That Datner, she thought to herself. Couldn't he have waited another hour before telling her about a deteriorating baby?!

And why was the baby deteriorating anyway? He was perfectly fine this morning.

She would blame Datner for everything at the morning meeting. That was good for his character development.

The urine flowed relatively easily. In all cases. For Katya, Datner, and the temporarily stabilized preemie.

Relief.

Dr. Katya did not remember to check why the deteriorating baby was not given antibiotic treatment without reason, or what work-up was done to identify the possible infection. It was as if, in the heat of the events, she missed Datner's answer. Too bad; distraction was uncharacteristic of her.

# Chapter 2  -  A Collection of Amateurs

""A collection of amateurs,"" I snapped. ""Just a bunch of amateurs. Not a single one of them belongs in a professional organization.""

The phone rang. It always rings in the bathroom, and always while I’m reading an article about the only soccer team I care about, FC ‘Sharona Sharks.’ A team with no luck; a fan with no luck.

I didn't know who was on the line. I’d replaced too many phones in recent years, and when one of the backups crashed, I just stopped trying to sync contacts. My call log was a graveyard of digits. Most names no longer appeared identified, just numbers, like Holocaust survivors. Those who merited a name, everyone deserves one, after all, were usually labeled as ""Blocked,"" ""Do Not Answer,"" ""Do Not Answer 3,"" or the more recent ""Blocked, Do Not Answer Forever. New.""

It was Datner. A pleasant enough fellow. I'd known him since he was a young, enthusiastic student. He was a good man, back during his internship. Pediatric residency hadn't done him any favors. His fair hair had receded and turned a premature gray, and his zest for life had almost completely evaporated. He was no longer light-hearted. I’d even known him while he was mourning his mother, and even then, he was more optimistic than he was now.

""Datner, I'm not a consultant for the NICU. Take your madness elsewhere. I had intended to spend the day in glorious, uninterrupted indolence,"" I shot back before he could even draw breath. Better to set the record straight before the request to claim my soul arrived.

He didn't stop. He was always stubborn. He apologized at length, babbling something incoherent about having been on duty in the NICU three days ago. Now, there were two isolates in a baby’s blood culture. The infectious disease specialist had dismissed it as contamination, but Datner feared it was real. He was truly sorry, he said, but maybe I could take a look?

It sounded like typical nonsense. I told him so. He insisted I come. Even just for five minutes.

I insisted I felt like hell. That was true; I hadn't felt well since the late 1980s. It didn't help. He insisted. The boy was relentless. I told him to shut up and let me drink my coffee, and that I’d be there in fifteen minutes.

""Promise?"" he asked. ""A sailor's promise, diseased with syphilis,"" I replied.

He hung up. Slow to take a hint, that one. But a good guy.

\*\*\*

A few minutes later, I was already nodding my head towards several familiar faces from the past. A gaggle of nurses who I had no idea were still alive. I didn't know any of their names, of course. Except for one, *Susan Schell*, who stood at the edge of the ward, near the kitchenette. ""Is she still alive?"" I wondered internally (or perhaps I shouted it, I'm not sure). She hadn't changed much at all. Maybe a wrinkle here, a white hair there, but still the beautiful Susan. An American from hell.

I adopted what I call my 'Dreamy Genius' expression, the one that says 'don't interrupt my profound thoughts' and strode briskly toward the place of the incubator in question, ignoring the astonished gazes of all the occupants. Datner was already standing there, beside the incubator containing a small body and many tubes.

""The little guy doesn't look good, friend,"" I opened with an immediate taunt.

""Aging fast,"" the impertinent student replied.

""You were somewhat economical with the truth regarding the patient’s status,"" I bristled.

""It happened recently, just this morning,"" Datner tried to defend himself.

A weak, apologetic response. Total surrender.

At this point, I grew tired of the intellectual chess game. More accurately, the easy victory prevented me from feeling any sense of satisfaction, so I decided to get to the point. This way, I would at least significantly cut down on my stay in the NICU, a unit I hadn't tolerated, along with its people, for over sixteen years. I glanced at the patient's chart and even managed to read a few lines before returning to torment Datner. It’s important to arrive prepared for battle; otherwise, there is a danger that the opponent might have a fair chance of success, heaven forbid.

I remember being a young student, not even a resident, when I heard people speaking respectfully about me behind my back. Rumors were circulated about the new genius on the ward, who knew everything during rounds, even before the attending physician. I will reveal the secret of the aforementioned magic to you, even though a proper magician never reveals his secrets. The whole secret lies in arriving half an hour before everyone else, opening all the charts of the new admissions from the night, and memorizing the admission details. Especially numbers of vital signs and selected lab indices. That's it. That’s the whole secret. A little memorization and spurting out the numbers before everyone finishes their coffee, and the title 'genius' is thrown your way without a problem. The art of illusion. The art of the lie.

""So, I see we have a small preemie, ventilated on inotropes, with a borderline pulse and unstable blood pressure, oxygenating with difficulty, and prone to ending his visit on planet Earth. And you say the little prince wasn't like this until your shift?"" I fired quickly. That's always my method. Stun them before they regain their composure.

If the fight is fair, there's a good chance you'll lose. After all, I was in enemy territory.

Datner was about to open his mouth when Dr. Katya appeared behind him.

\*\*\*

""Exactly, Prof. B.S., exactly. Simply appalling. Seventy-two hours ago, this was a completely healthy baby. And now? What a disaster,"" she almost sobbed. *Since when did she get so worked up? I remembered her as a cold fish, not spicy fish stew.*

""How are you, dear Dr. Katya?"" I mustered my most empathetic tone. I remember not tolerating her 20 years ago, when she first arrived at 'Sharona'. She was already a senior, and I was just a young, clueless resident. This whole meeting felt strange and unwelcome to me.

She didn't answer. She considered making a stinging comment but knew I'd fire back immediately. She gave up. Instead, Datner launched into a speech about cultures. I wasn't listening. There was a medical chart next to the incubator, and I picked it up and saw the problem immediately. I silenced Datner with a finger, and immediately burst forth with the following sentence:

""Gram-positive cocci in chains and Gram-positive bacilli. In the same culture. From the same time. Strange. Definitely strange.""

\*\*\*

""What do you say, Datner? Can you explain to Dr. Pavlichuk and me the possibilities in the differential diagnosis?""

Datner puffed out his chest. It was clear he had prepared for this. He launched into a monologue so long it felt like movie exposition.

""Three big possibilities. All of them are quite strange. First, contamination. The two growths are meaningless. This doesn't explain the child's condition, but it eliminates the need to understand the strange culture result."" I smiled; there was an echo of my own words from the past in his reply, it was clear the youth enjoyed quoting me. He continued:

""The second possibility is that only one bacterium is real, and the other is a contaminant. In that case, we need to analyze each possibility regarding each bacterium.""

""And the third possibility?"" I decided to intervene, even though it was completely unnecessary.

""Both bacteria represent real infections, which are not necessarily related, and may not even have been acquired in the same way, but both led to the child's deterioration."" The defense rested.

""I feel almost superfluous here, Datner and Katya. It's clear you've considered all the options. I'm sure you've already discussed the possible identity of the bacteria,"" I said, injecting a hint of mild insult into my words.

""Of course,"" Katya shrieked.

That woman needs sedatives; I decreed to myself. I nearly had a heart attack because of her sudden franticness.

""And?"" I pressed.

""Datner, tell him,"" Katya said, with a semblance of quasi-authoritativeness.

It was clear to me that she was afraid of making a mistake, and even more than that, trembling with fear at the possibility that I would correct her.

""The Streptococci are probably **GBS**,"" Datner began lecturing, ""That's the most common cause of neonatal sepsis, even this late.""

""And...?"" I continued to press.

""It could also be *Enterococcus*, though you taught me that without risk factors, it almost never does anything,"" chirped the visibly unshaven student. This didn't bother me; I had made a point of not arriving clean-shaven at work for over twenty years. I always replied to supervisors' questions about my poor shaving capabilities with the same answer: ""When I have time to sleep, I'll shave and maybe even shower."" I liked Datner's answer, even though he didn't list every possibility in the world. I decided to let it go and not press the point right now. This was uncharacteristic of me.

""And the second bacterium, Datner?"" I continued.

""The second is contamination or *Listeria*,"" he answered.

""Excellent,"" I smiled, ""And what about that entire list of Gram-positive bacilli I taught you a million times? Won't you repeat it for me?"" I purred sweetly.

""*Sure. Listeria*, Diphtheroids including *Diphtheria*, *Actinomyces*, *Nocardia*, *Clostridium*, and something else I forgot,"" Datner rattled off. I must have taught him that at least two hundred times. Or perhaps I'm exaggerating, and it was only six times.

""You forgot *Bacillus*, *Anthrax*, and *Cereus*,"" I fired back conspicuously. After all, I had to make it clear there was only one lion in the room.

""Well, I see you're managing fine without me. What treatment are you giving?"" I began moving toward the exit, carefully projecting indifference.

""Ampicillin, Gentamicin, and Claforan,"" Katya replied. ""To cover all the bases. Dr. Rina Renana advised it - it was started with the first consultation, the morning after the collapse,"" she added, almost apologetically.

She probably thought I would lash out if she left something out. A disgusting thought. I do not believe in violence. I only believe in death and the suffering preceding it. Everything else is debatable.

""Of course, excellent treatment,"" I replied with conspicuous mockery (It's strange they aren't giving empirical *Vancomycin* for a line infection and Gram-positive bacteria, I thought dismissively. That was quite shocking, to be honest) and decided to walk straight toward the exit door. One last fleeting glance at the incubator made it clear to me that this wouldn't end here. This baby wouldn't survive much longer.

I glanced at Dr. Katya's shoes. A ridiculous shade of red. The number **66** on the sneaker. Sixes mirroring each other. Like the word **SOS.** **DAD. MOM. TUT.** Funny. **LOL**.

""Update me on everything, and think about **Vanco**' - it's recommended,"" I shouted on my way out. I knew there was no chance of coming back to this hole.

\*\*\*

In bed at night, I struggled to fall asleep.

When I have trouble sleeping, I count other people’s medical errors. Never my own.

Datner disappointed me. I knew he would disappoint me. He isn't the first of my students to do so. I learned to prepare them for failure from my very first meeting with them. 'I will never be satisfied,' that is how I would open the intimidation speech that brought them into my life. It was also a means of filtering. Those who fled for their lives weren't worth the effort anyway. Unfortunately, those who stayed weren't always worth the whole ordeal either. Datner was actually fine. But *not* starting antibiotics during the night? What is wrong with him?! I explicitly taught him, always love the patient. Always look for what can be done to improve their condition. Even slightly. No matter how irritating his mother is. Especially if his mother is irritating and hysterical. They are always right.

I wondered what possibilities he considered when he decided not to treat with antibiotics. Obviously, he didn't think of sepsis. Maybe he thought the deterioration was purely respiratory? Or neurological? What an odd decision. It looks like laziness. At least he performed the differential diagnosis of the Gram-positive bacteria well. I wonder if he sat and prepared for my arrival, reading again from the textbook that is completely abandoned during residency. Of course, he did.

I expected nothing from Dr. Katya. She always seemed to me like a useless ornamental foliage. Another background figure in the avant-garde post-modern painting called 'Sharona'.

But Dr. Renana, despite her constant depression, should have started Vancomycin. That woman doesn't think straight. Foggy brain, like a second-year student on a third exam attempt. A special session for special people.

The poor medical charting in the NICU was no surprise at all. It hadn't changed since I was a resident there. A good place to sleep at night, unless triplets were born at 26 weeks. Then a sleepless *white night* is in store for you. The meaning of the expression *'white* *night*' is, of course, *black night*'.

I was sure I would hear more about the case being managed with such meticulousness that no mistake was missed. I regretted discovering very quickly that I was right.

\*\*\*

# Chapter 3 - The Traffic Jams at the Hospital Entrance

The traffic jams at the hospital entrance did not suit Professor Magen Ra'anan. The Acting Director of 'Sharona' Hospital found it intolerable that someone of his stature should wait in traffic with common mortals. He almost considered honking but stopped himself. Who knows, perhaps there was a resident stuck in the entrance traffic jam. Even the guard, who recognized him from afar, a hundred meters off, knew him and could tell his friends about it. Unpleasant.

Professor Magen Ra'anan, whom no one ever called Magen, and no one remembered what he specialized in (Nephrology), finally arrived at the parking lot. He recalled how much he despised the other members of management, **his** management, technically. Well, technically, he was only the **Acting** Director. But he had been the Acting Director for many years. In practice, he was the Director. Obviously. The doctors' parking lot was full of visitors' cars. There were always visitors. Thousands of visitors. None of them had ever learned how to park. Handbrake.

Professor Ra'anan had a mustache. Since forever, always a mustache, ever since his Bar Mitzvah. Initially, it was a boy's fuzz. A thin, light down. Embarrassing in its prematurity. He didn't shave it until his enlistment and had gotten used to the look. Subsequently, for years he had a 'broom' mustache. Like a generic tough British sergeant in recruitment posters. But when he became the Acting Director, he trimmed the mustache slightly to look more respectable. Something in the style of a 19th-century Viennese intellectual. The mustache served, therefore, as a constant disguise. Occasionally changing in character, but perpetually on his face. A mark of Cain.

Ra'anan got out of the car, struggling to step on his right foot, a memory of a car accident he had as a child. He had always refused to use a cane. He would not look like a disabled person. Ra'anan made sure, as was his habit, to check all the doors and wheels, attempting to see if anyone had recently vandalized his car. He would perform this check every time he entered or exited the car. Like a paranoid investor awaiting catastrophe. He would always find a new scratch on the corner of the door, or a key mark etched below the window. It seemed that the entire world aimed only to harm him and his new car. Always a new car.

Phone. A strange sound, Jamaican sounding. '*Oh, baby, I love your way, every day*.' The ringtone and the gloomy phone owner were in a relationship that could only be described as cognitive dissonance.

""Hello? Hello? Who is it? I can't hear anything,"" Magen shrieked, almost automatically, without verifying that he was actually having trouble hearing his interlocutor. ""NICU? From the spokesperson's office? Alright, alright, a few minutes, I'm already in the parking lot, I'll arrive when I arrive."" Disconnection. He had a heavy Argentinian accent. The word 'Spokesperson's' sounded more like *Spokesperrrrson's*.

*'Damn it*,' he muttered, fully aware that he was the only witness to his display of frustration. He would have to visit the NICU and speak with the spokesperson. Too much trouble.

He preferred to do what he had done for the last thirty years. Idling in front of the computer. He would organize the articles on the news sites by interest. Every site had its own arrangement. Politics next to sports, gossip next to cooking. 'It passes the long hours of morning rounds nicely,' he often thought to himself. Not that he remembered what rounds looked like. Every time he volunteered to do one in recent years, he would find himself bored in the very first room. Worse, he didn't know what the residents were talking about or what they wanted from his life. Their questions were boring, stupid, or ones he didn't know the answer to. The latter kind was stressful. He skipped more and more of the little he did. Better to focus on mock meetings and organizing web articles. It was more respectable and suited his status.

To the NICU. He would certainly impress them, those cowards. All the doctors there were professional sycophants, especially the hysterical Dr. Katya and her even more hysterical Director. He liked that unit, a collection of chickens. But first, to his room on the second floor. A short tour of the wards before the day began. It conveyed an impression of professionalism and attention to every detail. Very important, he reflected, very important.

\*\*\*

The tour of the various wards was quick and uninteresting. Even in Ward C of Pediatrics, there was nothing interesting. An unfamiliar resident on call (whom Ra'anan thought might be a family medicine resident but was actually a confused intern who had agreed to be on call that night, despite the objections of the ward attending). In Ward F of Pediatrics, however, he saw an interesting chart on the desk. ""**Bar'el**."" That's quite a name from the past. Where did they pull him from?! Bar'el was a doctor who used to work for him, long ago. Until about 11 years ago. Or maybe 22 years. It wasn't clear. Probably 15 years, or some similarly asymmetrical number.

Ra'anan hated Bar'el. The filthy loser, who ran off to America and took Ilana and everything with him.

It must be a different Bar'el, and he’s just getting annoyed for nothing. What are the chances? He dismissed the thought.

He didn't notice that he forgot to visit the last ward, jumped on his way to the NICU via the Emergency Room, and disappeared behind the elevator next to the big green dumpster.

To the NICU!

\*\*\*

""What do you mean the journalist Sigal Segal wants to talk to me?"" Professor Ra'anan exclaimed, ""What do I have to do with her?"" he added. His mustache prickled, as if it were a barometer predicting changes in air pressure. The mustache informed Ra'anan that the pressure gauge had risen.

""She said you'd remember her from the previous Listeria outbreak in the NICU,"" answered Sarah Shabbat, the head nurse of the Pediatric Division, as she tried to hide behind the spokesperson's shoulders.

This answer struck Ra'anan in the gut. He was not prepared for this painful reminder. So many years had passed, but the mere mention of the topic caused him considerable abdominal discomfort. He would have to make an excuse and go to the bathroom in the next few minutes. This pressure would have to be released - from above or below. How, for God's sake, did Segal find out about a new *Listeria* growth in the NICU? The lab released the result less than three hours ago. Someone is 'singing' to her, Ra'anan decided.

In any case, the need to maintain composure and a dignified façade caused him to reply dryly: ""I will handle it.""

He would have preferred to have his teeth pulled without anesthesia, or to participate in Russian roulette with five bullets and one empty chamber. Still a non-negligible chance of survival. Professor Ra'anan didn't know how to calculate that chance. It was an 83% chance of death. Still better on the scale of horror compared to certain death in a conversation with a nosy journalist.

Meanwhile, he swallowed some saliva and half-shrieked, half-called out in a voice that tried to sound authoritative but came out sounding like a distress signal, ""Has anyone seen Dr. [Renana]()?""

So, I have been on this coffee journey for some while and for the past year or so coffee has stopped affecting me. Usually i go for a mid roast to a mid-light roast but for the past two months or so I have been consuming light roast coffee, at least 3-5 cups minimum on a daily basis. It is affecting my daily working.

The only coffee that actually worked for me for the past few months was this ""Vietnamese Dragon balls"", that i got from Algerian Coffee store on my visit to UK. This was very strong Robusta beans.

It is store policy that we are not allowed to heat up those baked goods for customers who purchase them. They are free to go home and pop em in a microwave, but we’re not allowed to do it for them. I think it’s mostly due to the fact that if we did this for all customers who bought day olds then it would discourage people from buying fresh baked goods. If you want to sit and have a warm baked good at our store, you can pay full price. The other part of it is that it is quality control. People can do whatever they want at home, but the owner doesn’t want us serving day old microwaved baked goods because it’s just not the standard of food he wants to be serving to customers to sit down and munch on. Regardless of what you think of that rule, it’s the rule and I can’t do anything about it.

Well, there’s one couple who will come in and only ever buys a bag of day olds, nothing else, and then every time, without fail, will ask me to heat them up. And everytime, without fail, I will let them know that it is against store policy and I will not do that. And, without fail, they will make a stink about it and treat me poorly.

It usually starts out with the wife making the purchase and asking me to heat them up. Then rolling her eyes and pulling the “seriously? The microwave is right there, just heat it up. Really? I just don’t see why you won’t do this” And I just keep going “It’s store policy. I can’t do that for you.”

She will then walk away, rolling her eyes, and then her husband will come up and either try to pressure me into heating them up, or will go to whoever else is working and try to get them to heat it up. This sometimes works because A. I work with mostly teenage girls who would rather just break the rules than be harassed by a grown man. and B. There is a high turnover rate at my work so many people have done it before being told that they are not allowed to do that.

At this point, for me, it’s the principle of the thing. They are both very rude and argue back to me \*everytime\* when they \*know\* and have been \*told\* that it is against the rules. Sending in your husband to try and intimidate teenage girls and young adult women is very very icky to me. And overall it just pisses me off because the message that sends to me is that they believe getting their day olds microwaved is more important than us putting our livelihoods in jeopardy. 

So, the question is, is there something more that I can say to them to send the message “Hey, this isn’t cool, and you need to stop?” Or should I just keep repeating “It’s store policy. I can’t do that for you.” Over and over everytime they come in.

I’ve thought about saying something like “M’am, I’ve told you we can’t do that. You know we can’t do that. Please stop trying to get us to break the rules for you.”

Or “M’am, this job is my livelihood and I’m not going to risk that to break the rules for you”

I’ve thought about going as far as to say “I won’t do that, and I would appreciate if you don’t have your husband come over and try to pressure us into it this time.”

But ultimately, maybe I should just stick with playing their stupid game and saying “Nope, against the rules” over and over. 

I’m very conflicted on this.",8,1768908263.0,barista,6,0.9,False

“Listen to the clock,” she says, her head pressed against your chest. You listen, the ticking echoing through the hall, but you don't know what you're trying to hear.



“What about it?”



“The number of clicks,” she replies. “The ninth and eleventh clicks are louder.”



You listen again, not expecting much. You realize she’s right. There's a pattern.



Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick.



Click.



Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick.



Click.



“We're going to die together,” she mumbles.



Your heart falls. You were hoping that for once, just for one day, she wouldn't say something that scared you.



“What?”



“It's okay,” she says. “It already happened. I watched it.”



You think to yourself that she didn't use to be this way. She used to be the sane one. She used to make sense. You want to say it pisses you off, but you don't even know who to be angry at.



“We're going to come back as crows,” she says. “And fly off away from here. I've seen it.”



“I thought you said musicians possess their guitars when they die.”



She goes quiet. Her body trembles, like she's hiccuping. You look down and she's crying. She buries her face in your shirt and you say,



“Laura, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. Please don't cry.”



She shakes her head.



“I've been having the worst dreams,” she says. “I've seen everything. The gears and strings. I want to tell you but you wouldn't understand. They tied us up Evan. They got us.”



You try to think of anything to say.



The best you can come up with is,



“I don't know how to help you.”



She shakes her head again and repeats the statement back to you in a cracking whisper.



“I don't know how to help you.”

The TV is on.



You don't know how long it's been on. You don't know who turned it on. You don't know how you didn't notice. Eleven years without television and it just crept its way back like it never left in the first place.



You sit on the couch and watch, the coffee Evan made you sitting in your hands. There's a commercial for “Uptown Girls” playing. It's all just flashes of images. A beach house. A swimming pool. A woman tossing champagne from her glass onto another woman's dress. Appalled faces and sound effects. Horror stings. Whooshing sounds.



The ad ends and another starts. Half naked women lounge around a pool and a man with a platter full of Coronas, who passes out beers and limes with a big, pearly smile.



You take a sip of the coffee and it tastes bitter. You swallow and your mouth goes numb. 



The screen goes black.



And now there's a flag.



Red, white, and blue, billowing in the wind.



Stars. Bright stars. Stars so bright the flag disappears.



You take a sip of your coffee but you don't even taste it now.



They're not stars. No. No. It's light, reflecting off glass. 



Lenses.



Fifty lenses.



And fifty more.



And one hundred.



And one hundred-fifty.



And two hundred-fifty.



Four hundred.



Six fifty.



Spiraling, spiraling. 



Your face burns. You're sweating. You want to look away but you can't. 



Ten fifty.



Seventeen hundred



Twenty-seven fifty.



Spiraling, spiraling.



Spiraling into a black hole.



A black hole in a white void.



An eye.



The massive eye of the Martian Antichrist.



Somewhere, deep beneath the reality framework, you hear it scream.



It sees you, it hates you, and it knows where you are.



You scramble for the remote but you can't find it anywhere. The room starts to shake and you can hear the heavy clanking of machinery, pounding against the walls. In your desperation, you throw the mug at the TV. It crashes and shatters the screen, spilling coffee across the floor. Red and blue light flickers over the web of cracked glass but behind the digital, electric chaos, the eye is still there. Watching. Hating.



Your heart threatens to beat its way out of your chest as you dive to the floor and rip out the cord. The screen goes dark and the noise stops.



You're hyperventilating now. Your stomach hurts and it feels like there's battery acid in your veins. You try to crawl to the bathroom but you can't make it in time before the vomit comes up, spilling onto the floor. It tastes like that bitter coffee and a bit of it gets in your hair.



You sob, your voice echoing in the silent apartment. 



Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick.



Click.



Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick.



Click.



A sound.



Shuffling in the wall across the room.



You climb to your feet, unsteady on your legs, and you listen.



It moves again. There's someone in there, someone in the wall.



You back up, staring at the plaster as you carefully avoid stepping in your own vomit. As quietly as possible, you retreat to the kitchen. There's a butcher knife, sitting on the counter. You grab it and creep back into the living room.



You follow the quiet sounds of movement, tracing along the wall, the knife trembling in your grip. You can't feel your face anymore and your palms are sweaty.



The movement stops. You take a deep, shaky breath.



You plunge the knife into the wall. 



Again.



And again.



And again.



Black bile leaks out from the holes in the plaster. It bleeds a stench of stomach acid and digestive death. 



You stumble back as it drips onto the floor. A large crack forms in the wall, connecting the holes. 



The wall splits apart like paper mache.



Then the ceiling.



Then the sky.



A thousand eyes poke a thousand holes in a canvas of charred flesh, staring down upon you through a tunnel of cycling gears. You scramble behind the filing cabinet in the corner and hide behind your knees as black tendrils reach through the reality machine, skin peeling around the iron teeth to reveal pink muscle beneath.



Rain falls from the hole in the sky and into the apartment, dripping off the cogs and pulleys. Each movement the Beast makes as it writhes closer sends a cascading shower of water down from its skin, pooling on the floor in a rising tide of soot, bile, and ejecta. 



And as you ball yourself up on floor, gripping your wet hair with your fists,



And as you think to yourself that it wasn't supposed to end this way,



You see it.



A single drop of water, glowing like a diamond in the light of the heavens.



It falls from above, narrowly missing the ropes that cut across the grand tunnel in the sky and the twisting arms of the Glutton and lands on the filing cabinet beside you.



As the Martian inches ever closer, you throw open the top drawer and claw through the files. Page after page of paperwork, useless information, and numbers go slipping through your fingers and into the murky water as you skim them for whatever Jesus wants you to find. Another glistening tear falls and hits a loose piece of notebook paper in the back, soaking into the paper. You yank it out and find a phone number, scribbled in pen at the top of the page.



The arms of the Beast reach from the ceiling and stretch out toward you as you clamber across the room. One of its tendrils snap in your direction and latch around your leg. You scream as you fall to the floor, reaching for the door in vain.



You twist around as the Beast drags you back, thrashing and struggling in the water. You twist around and slash at the tentacle with the butcher knife, sending black bile spewing out of the wound. The arm releases you and reels back as the Antichrist howls in pain. You feel a stinging pain in your leg and when you look down you see a streak of red where you grazed yourself with the blade. 



You make it to your feet and launch yourself at the door, throwing it open and bursting out.",1,1768908262.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

# Prologue: Professor B.S.

Professor B.S. suffered from eternal insomnia. He sat before his television screen, far too alert.

**3:21.**

An interesting hour. Even more so when read in reverse. A basketball game murmured in the background, entirely irrelevant.

B.S. was contemplating the critical ethics of eating during a lecture. Not the students eating; that was perfectly legitimate in his eyes. He was thinking about the lecturer eating, mid-presentation. Nothing heavy, like beef and potatoes. Something light. A pleasant little salad. Perhaps a can of something carbonated on the side. But the students might take offense. The pretentious ones would likely file a complaint with the faculty.

*Ridiculous. It’s for their own benefit,* B.S. mused.

It would allow him to survive the mid-lecture hypoglycemia and bring the entire performance to a crescendo.

Perhaps he could bring in a patient while he was at it. Well, at least an actor. He could demonstrate meningeal signs on them - bend the neck until they screamed their soul out in pain.

Unpleasant.

Meningitis is undeniably unpleasant. Fortunately, only the actor must suffer.

Professor B.S. considered breaking his routine tomorrow to perform a ward round. A 'Peacock Walk,' just to remind everyone he was still among the living. Perhaps he would bark at someone regarding a botched chest X-ray interpretation, or, more amusingly, offer a rare word of praise to the department’s most incompetent resident. It was always good for a laugh.

The mere thought caused a twitch in his left flank. Or his right. Or both. Dealing with the actual practice of medicine was a dangerous business. Too demanding. Better to stick to lectures and remain entombed in his office. The air conditioning was sublime this time of year. Airy weather.

It was already four in the morning. Not good; sleep was no longer an option. Better to get dressed and brew some coffee. The morning would arrive soon enough.

\*\*\*

# Chapter 1 – Beep. Beep. Beep.

**Beep. Beep. Beep.**

White noise.

**Beep. Beep. Beep.**

White noise.

Dr. Eran Datner, the miserable resident on duty in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at 'Sharona' Hospital, glanced at his watch. 3:23. A digital watch. A toy for the new generation. He disliked the time staring back at him, something too symmetrical about it. Either too early to get up or far too late.

In any case, he wondered why he had woken up. The background drone of the monitors was a poor excuse. It was barely audible from behind the on-call room door in the NICU. It must be something else.

**Ring. Ring. Ring.**

The phone. The nurse Susan. Susan Schell.

That never meant anything good.

That American only spoke up to rant about vaccines or bark about resuscitation.

**Resuscitation**.

He leapt out of bed, nearly forgetting to put on his shoes, and bolted from the room. His thinning hair was disheveled, and he was wholly dazed and bewildered. He did not know what awaited him.

\*\*\*

Datner nearly stumbled over the nurses' desk before truly opening his eyes. He felt sour. Like a lemon squeezed into a margarita that had sat in the sun for far too long.

He knew what he had to do.

Too late.

Washing his face now would make the nurses look at him strangely. Combing his hair was out of the question; he had never owned a comb (he knew he did not have much to comb anyway). It was time for action.

Room 11.

The resuscitation in Room 11.

Susan had said it explicitly, that unhinged American from hell.

*Too harsh. Just an unhinged American, then. Still tough, though. American, the harshest curse of all.*

**Resuscitation**.

He pulled back the curtain of Room 11.

\*\*\*

A large incubator. Transparent. Horribly generic.

The baby was unmistakably **blue**.

It had a name, but no one cared about that at this stage. At this stage, it wasn't even clear what the baby’s sex was. A few things were clear to Datner now. The monitor above the incubator showed a low oxygen saturation of 76%, and the baby looked distinctly blue.

The pulse and blood pressure were not being read by the monitor, and there were too many nurses around the small incubator. At least three nurses. At least one of them was Susan Schell. That couldn't be good.

Worst of all, the incubator had not yet been opened. That really annoyed him.

He pushed his way past the flustered nurses, opened the incubator, and shouted at Susan - ""The Ambu, now."" He began ventilating. '*Not too hard,*' he recalled the advice of his old mentor, Prof. B.S., '*Gently, so you don’t burst the baby’s lungs.*'

The lungs, surprisingly, did not resist at all. The air pushed by the Ambu flowed easily into the small body, which gradually turned pinker and pinker.

""What are the blood pressure and pulse?"" Datner called out into the air, stifling a small smile at the saturation rising to 99%. *Even better than 100, better symmetry*. The sound the monitor emitted became much more tolerable. Almost melodic. Harmonic. *The Beach Boys* at their peak. *God Only Knows*.

""Still not reading,"" a voice from outer space replied.

That alien irritated Datner.

""Bring me a tube, size 2.5. And a laryngoscope with a small blade,"" he practically grumbled, disappointed by the slow flow of the event.

He did not fail to notice that Susan was working flawlessly. With all her faults, she was still quite experienced. She handed him the laryngoscope and the tube.

He put down the Ambu and inserted the laryngoscope.

'*Straight up at a right angle. With the patient’s eyes facing the ceiling,*' he recalled another piece of advice from Prof. B.S. Advice for all time. A Man for all seasons.

He wondered where B.S. was now.

Probably sitting at home watching TV and getting annoyed about his low salary. Who watches TV at this hour? Is the man a psychopath?!

Never mind. Moving on.

The vocal cords were clearly visible. A piece of cake. He inserted the tube quickly. Now, fixation.

This was the part he hated. He always felt the nurses would cause him to pull out the tube at that moment. Susan, however, didn't panic. ""At 9.5 centimeters, Doctor?"" she asked, almost affectionately.

""Yes,"" he mumbled, slightly surprised by her positive approach. He connected the Ambu to the tube and squeezed gently, compressing the small bellows only slightly, so as not to burst the lungs.

Meanwhile, the pulse returned. Approximately.

The monitor showed something that looked approximately like an ECG tracing in Lead 2. Not quite.

*The stickers! They had fallen off the baby’s chest. Nurse Miri was attaching them now. Other than that, she was useless. She should learn from Susan.*

Pulse 150. A small smile.

""And blood pressure?"" Datner almost whispered.

""Wait, I'm changing the cuff, the previous one is too big,"" Susan answered. He *almost* began to like her. Not really, but still, a little, given the situation and the alternatives. Better unhinged and efficient than sane and harmful.

Another half a minute passed. Thirty seconds is a long time when you are waiting. He began to remember how tired he was. A big yawn. Overt. For everyone to see. The questionable scent of his breath forced him to stop the show. If you eat something after midnight, it’s best not to have it spicy or with a lot of garlic. Crucially, it's best not to have **both** ingredients, Datner noted. Failed note.

Meanwhile, the tube fixation was finished, and he turned to adjust the parameters on the ventilator. He never quite understood how to choose the numbers, the ventilation metrics. Strange names for pressures – ‘PIP’, ‘PEEP’, and all sorts of other 'peeps' ran through his head. He also had pressure in his bladder. A sudden need to urinate. Fortunately, he sorted that out relatively easily here. Almost a coincidence. Dumb luck.

""Blood pressure 60/30,"" Susan cried, almost shouted, in a tone of joy, into the space.

It won't get better than that, Datner decided.

He barely knew what to do with himself now that he was no longer holding the tube or calibrating the ventilator. Nurse Miri smiled. Like a calf that had been given excellent straw.

Nurse Susan was frowning. Despite her advanced age, something of the Southern American beauty in which she had once excelled remained. *The Texas beauty queen forty years ago, no doubt*. He didn't recall her being originally from New York.

""What about Dextro?"" Datner barked.

""Immediately, Doctor,"" Susan replied submissively. She clearly had excellent training and manners that were out of this world. Foreign to the place.

He almost decided to go out to the stairwell and steal a few puffs of a cigarette.

Maybe it is better to update the on-call physician first.

But first, read the chart, he concluded.

He knew nothing about the infant who had just returned to life and certainly didn't know why this delicate creature had nearly collapsed completely. The on-call physician would not like a call about resuscitation without concrete information about the patient. He wasn't even sure if it was a male. He thought he saw testes during the ventilation, but he wasn't prepared to swear to it.

Still, a cigarette first. The on-call physician was certainly asleep now, and there was no reason to rush and call her before everything was known.

The watch showed 3:53. Still too symmetrical.

\*\*\*

""What do you mean, the baby in Room 11 almost died?"" the voice on the other end gasped. Datner wasn't sure if Dr. Katya Pavlichuk, the on-call neonatologist, was shouting or talking in her sleep. Maybe it was a combination of both? And what difference did it make anyway?

""He was perfectly fine this morning when I left him,"" the on-call physician continued, starting to wake up, grumbling about the uninvited wake-up call and the news it brought.

Datner glanced at his watch, 5:15, still symmetrical.

He thought that if he waited long enough, the on-call physician would appreciate the extra sleep time he had allowed her, and it would slightly dull the criticism of his ignorance regarding the chart.

He had tried earlier to read a little in the record, but everything was written in a particularly sloppy handwriting, worse even than his own, and most days there wasn't even a visit note. Only nurses’ comments alongside growth metrics and medication logs.

He gathered it was an infant (it was, after all, a male, those indeed were testes), a **29-week preemie** who had been in the NICU for two weeks, receiving some **TPN** (total parenteral nutrition; nutrition through the vein. The 'T' standing for Total - meaning exclusive IV nutrition, although the baby had already started receiving some formula).

And that was it.

Most of the time, the baby had been idling and lying in the incubator between visits, however many of those were conducted.

This was exactly what the on-call physician, Dr. Katya Pavlichuk, was lecturing him about now.

Datner wasn't really listening. He knew the ways of senior neonatologists. She would dump everything at him, regardless. Better to keep quiet and scowl. Healthier for his coronaries.

After a few more seconds (about two hundred, in Datner's estimation, who had begun to develop a slight, involuntary twitch) of a lecture on the essence of life and the fact that the baby had been perfect that morning when she left, Dr. Katya finally got around to asking something. It sounded like a question. Datner wasn't really listening.

Hello, hello, Datner, are you there?!"" Katya shrieked.

""Yes, certainly,"" Datner replied.

He was entertaining thoughts of early retirement. Considering his age (33, well-balanced), his professional status (a pediatric resident in his third out of four years), and his family status (unhappily married with two daughters who were probably very nice, he didn't really know them), these were premature, idle thoughts.

""How is the baby now? Is he ventilated? Does he need inotropes? Did you take cultures? Did you replace the central line? Did you start antibiotics?""

This was roughly what Dr. Katya rattled off. Datner wasn't really sure he cared.

""The baby is fine, easily ventilated, no inotropes, and no antibiotics,"" he replied, trying to avoid revealing the fact that he had failed to insert a central line and hadn't managed to take more than one blood culture. As for urine and cerebrospinal fluid cultures, forget about it. Let the morning shift do that. They rested all night.

He didn't tell Dr. Katya all of that, of course. She hadn't asked specifically. A small, harmless white lie, in Datner's opinion. She said she would arrive in about two hours (funny, that was the usual time for the morning meeting anyway) and that until then, he should update her if there was anything new. Anything at all.

""Yes, of course,"" Datner answered in an authoritative tone, his thoughts were far less polite.

\*\*\*

Dr. Katya Pavlichuk thought life was once more beautiful. When she was a child, still in Moscow, she dreamed of becoming a doctor. A pediatrician. She had always been the best student in school, the best student in medical school. Until she arrived in Israel. Straight to 'Sharona'.

When she arrived in the country, they told her 'Sharona' Hospital was in the Sharon region, as the name suggests. 'Two minutes from Tel Aviv,' they said. That was a crude lie; the drive was at least thirty minutes from Tel Aviv, and that was only if you drove at night, with zero traffic. No less. It wasn't really in the Sharon either; it was more in the Coastal Plain. She wasn't sure, and anyway, there was no one to complain to. But that’s where they assigned her, and she, being the good girl she was, did as she was instructed.

That was over twenty years ago already. Like another lifetime.

She tried to feel like she belonged from the start, but they didn't exactly make it easy.

For the first time in her life, she wasn't the popular success. She would hear them mocking her strange accent behind her back. Funny, in her eyes, the Israelis at 'Sharona' had the diction of Orientals. Mongolians. Descendants of Genghis Khan. Almost Mongoloid, she thought, a word she knew she shouldn’t be using. She remembered someone once told her that Dr. Down was a vicious, consummate racist. He was the one who gave the name 'Mongoloid' to babies with three sets of chromosomes 21 and slanted eyes. A smart fellow. A great racist, like all puffed-up Brits, but smart. He probably had crooked teeth. All smart Brits had crooked teeth. Even the not-so-smart ones. And they were all racists.

Only Dr. Renana treated her nicely, back then, when she first arrived at 'Sharona'. They became better friends. Renana was still sometimes happy then. Until that incident.

Now, as a veteran, Katya had learned to live in 'Sharona'. She no longer tried to excel. Excellence at 'Sharona' meant a death blow. A sign on your back. A mark of Cain.

She got out of bed and walked toward the bathroom. That Datner, she thought to herself. Couldn't he have waited another hour before telling her about a deteriorating baby?!

And why was the baby deteriorating anyway? He was perfectly fine this morning.

She would blame Datner for everything at the morning meeting. That was good for his character development.

The urine flowed relatively easily. In all cases. For Katya, Datner, and the temporarily stabilized preemie.

Relief.

Dr. Katya did not remember to check why the deteriorating baby was not given antibiotic treatment without reason, or what work-up was done to identify the possible infection. It was as if, in the heat of the events, she missed Datner's answer. Too bad; distraction was uncharacteristic of her.

\*\*\*

# Chapter 2  -  A Collection of Amateurs

""A collection of amateurs,"" I snapped. ""Just a bunch of amateurs. Not a single one of them belongs in a professional organization.""

The phone rang. It always rings in the bathroom, and always while I’m reading an article about the only soccer team I care about, FC ‘Sharona Sharks.’ A team with no luck; a fan with no luck.

I didn't know who was on the line. I’d replaced too many phones in recent years, and when one of the backups crashed, I just stopped trying to sync contacts. My call log was a graveyard of digits. Most names no longer appeared identified, just numbers, like Holocaust survivors. Those who merited a name, everyone deserves one, after all, were usually labeled as ""Blocked,"" ""Do Not Answer,"" ""Do Not Answer 3,"" or the more recent ""Blocked, Do Not Answer Forever. New.""

It was Datner. A pleasant enough fellow. I'd known him since he was a young, enthusiastic student. He was a good man, back during his internship. Pediatric residency hadn't done him any favors. His fair hair had receded and turned a premature gray, and his zest for life had almost completely evaporated. He was no longer light-hearted. I’d even known him while he was mourning his mother, and even then, he was more optimistic than he was now.

""Datner, I'm not a consultant for the NICU. Take your madness elsewhere. I had intended to spend the day in glorious, uninterrupted indolence,"" I shot back before he could even draw breath. Better to set the record straight before the request to claim my soul arrived.

He didn't stop. He was always stubborn. He apologized at length, babbling something incoherent about having been on duty in the NICU three days ago. Now, there were two isolates in a baby’s blood culture. The infectious disease specialist had dismissed it as contamination, but Datner feared it was real. He was truly sorry, he said, but maybe I could take a look?

It sounded like typical nonsense. I told him so. He insisted I come. Even just for five minutes.

I insisted I felt like hell. That was true; I hadn't felt well since the late 1980s. It didn't help. He insisted. The boy was relentless. I told him to shut up and let me drink my coffee, and that I’d be there in fifteen minutes.

""Promise?"" he asked. ""A sailor's promise, diseased with syphilis,"" I replied.

He hung up. Slow to take a hint, that one. But a good guy.

\*\*\*

A few minutes later, I was already nodding my head towards several familiar faces from the past. A gaggle of nurses who I had no idea were still alive. I didn't know any of their names, of course. Except for one, *Susan Schell*, who stood at the edge of the ward, near the kitchenette. ""Is she still alive?"" I wondered internally (or perhaps I shouted it, I'm not sure). She hadn't changed much at all. Maybe a wrinkle here, a white hair there, but still the beautiful Susan. An American from hell.

I adopted what I call my 'Dreamy Genius' expression, the one that says 'don't interrupt my profound thoughts' and strode briskly toward the place of the incubator in question, ignoring the astonished gazes of all the occupants. Datner was already standing there, beside the incubator containing a small body and many tubes.

""The little guy doesn't look good, friend,"" I opened with an immediate taunt.

""Aging fast,"" the impertinent student replied.

""You were somewhat economical with the truth regarding the patient’s status,"" I bristled.

""It happened recently, just this morning,"" Datner tried to defend himself.

A weak, apologetic response. Total surrender.

At this point, I grew tired of the intellectual chess game. More accurately, the easy victory prevented me from feeling any sense of satisfaction, so I decided to get to the point. This way, I would at least significantly cut down on my stay in the NICU, a unit I hadn't tolerated, along with its people, for over sixteen years. I glanced at the patient's chart and even managed to read a few lines before returning to torment Datner. It’s important to arrive prepared for battle; otherwise, there is a danger that the opponent might have a fair chance of success, heaven forbid.

I remember being a young student, not even a resident, when I heard people speaking respectfully about me behind my back. Rumors were circulated about the new genius on the ward, who knew everything during rounds, even before the attending physician. I will reveal the secret of the aforementioned magic to you, even though a proper magician never reveals his secrets. The whole secret lies in arriving half an hour before everyone else, opening all the charts of the new admissions from the night, and memorizing the admission details. Especially numbers of vital signs and selected lab indices. That's it. That’s the whole secret. A little memorization and spurting out the numbers before everyone finishes their coffee, and the title 'genius' is thrown your way without a problem. The art of illusion. The art of the lie.

""So, I see we have a small preemie, ventilated on inotropes, with a borderline pulse and unstable blood pressure, oxygenating with difficulty, and prone to ending his visit on planet Earth. And you say the little prince wasn't like this until your shift?"" I fired quickly. That's always my method. Stun them before they regain their composure.

If the fight is fair, there's a good chance you'll lose. After all, I was in enemy territory.

Datner was about to open his mouth when Dr. Katya appeared behind him.

\*\*\*

""Exactly, Prof. B.S., exactly. Simply appalling. Seventy-two hours ago, this was a completely healthy baby. And now? What a disaster,"" she almost sobbed. *Since when did she get so worked up? I remembered her as a cold fish, not spicy fish stew.*

""How are you, dear Dr. Katya?"" I mustered my most empathetic tone. I remember not tolerating her 20 years ago, when she first arrived at 'Sharona'. She was already a senior, and I was just a young, clueless resident. This whole meeting felt strange and unwelcome to me.

She didn't answer. She considered making a stinging comment but knew I'd fire back immediately. She gave up. Instead, Datner launched into a speech about cultures. I wasn't listening. There was a medical chart next to the incubator, and I picked it up and saw the problem immediately. I silenced Datner with a finger, and immediately burst forth with the following sentence:

""Gram-positive cocci in chains and Gram-positive bacilli. In the same culture. From the same time. Strange. Definitely strange.""

\*\*\*

""What do you say, Datner? Can you explain to Dr. Pavlichuk and me the possibilities in the differential diagnosis?""

Datner puffed out his chest. It was clear he had prepared for this. He launched into a monologue so long it felt like movie exposition.

""Three big possibilities. All of them are quite strange. First, contamination. The two growths are meaningless. This doesn't explain the child's condition, but it eliminates the need to understand the strange culture result."" I smiled; there was an echo of my own words from the past in his reply, it was clear the youth enjoyed quoting me. He continued:

""The second possibility is that only one bacterium is real, and the other is a contaminant. In that case, we need to analyze each possibility regarding each bacterium.""

""And the third possibility?"" I decided to intervene, even though it was completely unnecessary.

""Both bacteria represent real infections, which are not necessarily related, and may not even have been acquired in the same way, but both led to the child's deterioration."" The defense rested.

""I feel almost superfluous here, Datner and Katya. It's clear you've considered all the options. I'm sure you've already discussed the possible identity of the bacteria,"" I said, injecting a hint of mild insult into my words.

""Of course,"" Katya shrieked.

That woman needs sedatives; I decreed to myself. I nearly had a heart attack because of her sudden franticness.

""And?"" I pressed.

""Datner, tell him,"" Katya said, with a semblance of quasi-authoritativeness.

It was clear to me that she was afraid of making a mistake, and even more than that, trembling with fear at the possibility that I would correct her.

""The Streptococci are probably **GBS**,"" Datner began lecturing, ""That's the most common cause of neonatal sepsis, even this late.""

""And...?"" I continued to press.

""It could also be *Enterococcus*, though you taught me that without risk factors, it almost never does anything,"" chirped the visibly unshaven student. This didn't bother me; I had made a point of not arriving clean-shaven at work for over twenty years. I always replied to supervisors' questions about my poor shaving capabilities with the same answer: ""When I have time to sleep, I'll shave and maybe even shower."" I liked Datner's answer, even though he didn't list every possibility in the world. I decided to let it go and not press the point right now. This was uncharacteristic of me.

""And the second bacterium, Datner?"" I continued.

""The second is contamination or *Listeria*,"" he answered.

""Excellent,"" I smiled, ""And what about that entire list of Gram-positive bacilli I taught you a million times? Won't you repeat it for me?"" I purred sweetly.

""*Sure. Listeria*, Diphtheroids including *Diphtheria*, *Actinomyces*, *Nocardia*, *Clostridium*, and something else I forgot,"" Datner rattled off. I must have taught him that at least two hundred times. Or perhaps I'm exaggerating, and it was only six times.

""You forgot *Bacillus*, *Anthrax*, and *Cereus*,"" I fired back conspicuously. After all, I had to make it clear there was only one lion in the room.

""Well, I see you're managing fine without me. What treatment are you giving?"" I began moving toward the exit, carefully projecting indifference.

""Ampicillin, Gentamicin, and Claforan,"" Katya replied. ""To cover all the bases. Dr. Rina Renana advised it - it was started with the first consultation, the morning after the collapse,"" she added, almost apologetically.

She probably thought I would lash out if she left something out. A disgusting thought. I do not believe in violence. I only believe in death and the suffering preceding it. Everything else is debatable.

""Of course, excellent treatment,"" I replied with conspicuous mockery (It's strange they aren't giving empirical *Vancomycin* for a line infection and Gram-positive bacteria, I thought dismissively. That was quite shocking, to be honest) and decided to walk straight toward the exit door. One last fleeting glance at the incubator made it clear to me that this wouldn't end here. This baby wouldn't survive much longer.

I glanced at Dr. Katya's shoes. A ridiculous shade of red. The number **66** on the sneaker. Sixes mirroring each other. Like the word **SOS.** **DAD. MOM. TUT.** Funny. **LOL**.

""Update me on everything, and think about **Vanco**' - it's recommended,"" I shouted on my way out. I knew there was no chance of coming back to this hole.

\*\*\*

In bed at night, I struggled to fall asleep.

When I have trouble sleeping, I count other people’s medical errors. Never my own.

Datner disappointed me. I knew he would disappoint me. He isn't the first of my students to do so. I learned to prepare them for failure from my very first meeting with them. 'I will never be satisfied,' that is how I would open the intimidation speech that brought them into my life. It was also a means of filtering. Those who fled for their lives weren't worth the effort anyway. Unfortunately, those who stayed weren't always worth the whole ordeal either. Datner was actually fine. But *not* starting antibiotics during the night? What is wrong with him?! I explicitly taught him, always love the patient. Always look for what can be done to improve their condition. Even slightly. No matter how irritating his mother is. Especially if his mother is irritating and hysterical. They are always right.

I wondered what possibilities he considered when he decided not to treat with antibiotics. Obviously, he didn't think of sepsis. Maybe he thought the deterioration was purely respiratory? Or neurological? What an odd decision. It looks like laziness. At least he performed the differential diagnosis of the Gram-positive bacteria well. I wonder if he sat and prepared for my arrival, reading again from the textbook that is completely abandoned during residency. Of course, he did.

I expected nothing from Dr. Katya. She always seemed to me like a useless ornamental foliage. Another background figure in the avant-garde post-modern painting called 'Sharona'.

But Dr. Renana, despite her constant depression, should have started Vancomycin. That woman doesn't think straight. Foggy brain, like a second-year student on a third exam attempt. A special session for special people.

The poor medical charting in the NICU was no surprise at all. It hadn't changed since I was a resident there. A good place to sleep at night, unless triplets were born at 26 weeks. Then a sleepless *white night* is in store for you. The meaning of the expression *'white* *night*' is, of course, *black night*'.

I was sure I would hear more about the case being managed with such meticulousness that no mistake was missed. I regretted discovering very quickly that I was right.

\*\*\*

# Chapter 3 - The Traffic Jams at the Hospital Entrance

The traffic jams at the hospital entrance did not suit Professor Magen Ra'anan. The Acting Director of 'Sharona' Hospital found it intolerable that someone of his stature should wait in traffic with common mortals. He almost considered honking but stopped himself. Who knows, perhaps there was a resident stuck in the entrance traffic jam. Even the guard, who recognized him from afar, a hundred meters off, knew him and could tell his friends about it. Unpleasant.

Professor Magen Ra'anan, whom no one ever called Magen, and no one remembered what he specialized in (Nephrology), finally arrived at the parking lot. He recalled how much he despised the other members of management, **his** management, technically. Well, technically, he was only the **Acting** Director. But he had been the Acting Director for many years. In practice, he was the Director. Obviously. The doctors' parking lot was full of visitors' cars. There were always visitors. Thousands of visitors. None of them had ever learned how to park. Handbrake.

Professor Ra'anan had a mustache. Since forever, always a mustache, ever since his Bar Mitzvah. Initially, it was a boy's fuzz. A thin, light down. Embarrassing in its prematurity. He didn't shave it until his enlistment and had gotten used to the look. Subsequently, for years he had a 'broom' mustache. Like a generic tough British sergeant in recruitment posters. But when he became the Acting Director, he trimmed the mustache slightly to look more respectable. Something in the style of a 19th-century Viennese intellectual. The mustache served, therefore, as a constant disguise. Occasionally changing in character, but perpetually on his face. A mark of Cain.

Ra'anan got out of the car, struggling to step on his right foot, a memory of a car accident he had as a child. He had always refused to use a cane. He would not look like a disabled person. Ra'anan made sure, as was his habit, to check all the doors and wheels, attempting to see if anyone had recently vandalized his car. He would perform this check every time he entered or exited the car. Like a paranoid investor awaiting catastrophe. He would always find a new scratch on the corner of the door, or a key mark etched below the window. It seemed that the entire world aimed only to harm him and his new car. Always a new car.

Phone. A strange sound, Jamaican sounding. '*Oh, baby, I love your way, every day*.' The ringtone and the gloomy phone owner were in a relationship that could only be described as cognitive dissonance.

""Hello? Hello? Who is it? I can't hear anything,"" Magen shrieked, almost automatically, without verifying that he was actually having trouble hearing his interlocutor. ""NICU? From the spokesperson's office? Alright, alright, a few minutes, I'm already in the parking lot, I'll arrive when I arrive."" Disconnection. He had a heavy Argentinian accent. The word 'Spokesperson's' sounded more like *Spokesperrrrson's*.

*'Damn it*,' he muttered, fully aware that he was the only witness to his display of frustration. He would have to visit the NICU and speak with the spokesperson. Too much trouble.

He preferred to do what he had done for the last thirty years. Idling in front of the computer. He would organize the articles on the news sites by interest. Every site had its own arrangement. Politics next to sports, gossip next to cooking. 'It passes the long hours of morning rounds nicely,' he often thought to himself. Not that he remembered what rounds looked like. Every time he volunteered to do one in recent years, he would find himself bored in the very first room. Worse, he didn't know what the residents were talking about or what they wanted from his life. Their questions were boring, stupid, or ones he didn't know the answer to. The latter kind was stressful. He skipped more and more of the little he did. Better to focus on mock meetings and organizing web articles. It was more respectable and suited his status.

To the NICU. He would certainly impress them, those cowards. All the doctors there were professional sycophants, especially the hysterical Dr. Katya and her even more hysterical Director. He liked that unit, a collection of chickens. But first, to his room on the second floor. A short tour of the wards before the day began. It conveyed an impression of professionalism and attention to every detail. Very important, he reflected, very important.

\*\*\*

The tour of the various wards was quick and uninteresting. Even in Ward C of Pediatrics, there was nothing interesting. An unfamiliar resident on call (whom Ra'anan thought might be a family medicine resident but was actually a confused intern who had agreed to be on call that night, despite the objections of the ward attending). In Ward F of Pediatrics, however, he saw an interesting chart on the desk. ""**Bar'el**."" That's quite a name from the past. Where did they pull him from?! Bar'el was a doctor who used to work for him, long ago. Until about 11 years ago. Or maybe 22 years. It wasn't clear. Probably 15 years, or some similarly asymmetrical number.

Ra'anan hated Bar'el. The filthy loser, who ran off to America and took Ilana and everything with him.

It must be a different Bar'el, and he’s just getting annoyed for nothing. What are the chances? He dismissed the thought.

He didn't notice that he forgot to visit the last ward, jumped on his way to the NICU via the Emergency Room, and disappeared behind the elevator next to the big green dumpster.

To the NICU!

\*\*\*

""What do you mean the journalist Sigal Segal wants to talk to me?"" Professor Ra'anan exclaimed, ""What do I have to do with her?"" he added. His mustache prickled, as if it were a barometer predicting changes in air pressure. The mustache informed Ra'anan that the pressure gauge had risen.

""She said you'd remember her from the previous Listeria outbreak in the NICU,"" answered Sarah Shabbat, the head nurse of the Pediatric Division, as she tried to hide behind the spokesperson's shoulders.

This answer struck Ra'anan in the gut. He was not prepared for this painful reminder. So many years had passed, but the mere mention of the topic caused him considerable abdominal discomfort. He would have to make an excuse and go to the bathroom in the next few minutes. This pressure would have to be released - from above or below. How, for God's sake, did Segal find out about a new *Listeria* growth in the NICU? The lab released the result less than three hours ago. Someone is 'singing' to her, Ra'anan decided.

In any case, the need to maintain composure and a dignified façade caused him to reply dryly: ""I will handle it.""

He would have preferred to have his teeth pulled without anesthesia, or to participate in Russian roulette with five bullets and one empty chamber. Still a non-negligible chance of survival. Professor Ra'anan didn't know how to calculate that chance. It was an 83% chance of death. Still better on the scale of horror compared to certain death in a conversation with a nosy journalist.

Meanwhile, he swallowed some saliva and half-shrieked, half-called out in a voice that tried to sound authoritative but came out sounding like a distress signal, ""Has anyone seen Dr. [Renana]()?""

1qhyjz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/statementbegins/comments/1qhyjz6/black_hole/,Black hole,"**Statement of Poppy Baker, regarding an encounter in St Andrews University in December of 2013. Statement given on April of 2014. Statement begins.**

Have you ever been called cute? Not pretty, sweet, attractive, beautiful, no. Cute. It's such a double edged compliment. It's happened to me my whole life. Even my name. Poppy Baker. It sounds so small, words people associate with sweet treats and fragile flowers. My height certainly doesn't help, standing at exactly five feet I've almost always been the smallest one in my friend group. People would reach for things for me, offer to carry my bags, like I'm useless. I've always hated it. Maybe it's why I've always enjoyed stargazing. When you look at the infinite sky, everyone else feels just as tiny and insignificant. I took comfort in it. 

I say all this not to get pity, I have had enough of that in my short lifetime. I say this to put you in the context of my actions. Then again, when I turn my statement in I wager your receptionist will also dismiss me. That these violent, dark thoughts and experiences surely can't have been written by me. 

All I've ever wanted was for others to feel as small as I have. Maybe it's why I majored in astronomy. Once you fully comprehend just how large the universe is you give yourself less importance. But of course, this treatment didn't stop at uni. I always dealt with the same things. Classmates opening doors for me, or asking if I understood the material. Professors speaking to me gently, as if afraid I'd get too intimidated by the subjects I was studying. At first it bothered me. Then I leaned into it. You get away with a lot of things when you're a short girl in knee socks and a bouncing bob that makes your face seem rounder. Deadlines stopped mattering as much when I realised I could just cry and sway my professors into giving me extra time. I'm not sure when I learnt to perfect my ""lost deer"" look, but I hadn't even had my first period when I realised that men will do anything for a cute girl. 

I guess that's enough context for what I'm about to tell you next. This happened on April of last year. Classes were long over, but I was able to stay behind on the observatory. My idea was to take notes, but honestly, I just wanted to look out the telescope for no particular reason. Given no one complained, I didn't feel too guilty about sitting there for as many hours as I pleased, taking in the vastness of space. I didn't even have to change or move anything, just looking at it was pleasant. Calming, maybe. I've been meaning to write a paper on supermassive black holes for a while, so of course I've studied them very rigorously. I say this because what I saw wasn't that. I won't go into all the details, but most people imagine a deep, gaping hole in the fabric of the universe when you say ""black hole"". They don't look like that at all, I've put down a few sci-fi books down solely out of frustration over the lack of scientific rigour. 

As I looked up, everything was the way it's supposed to be. The endless emptiness that is space, littered with stars and other celestial forms. Sullying the beauty that is the emptiness. If I could remove them all, I would, but then again that would leave me without a job. And there it was. There was a... hole. Not a black hole, like I said. It was as though someone had been using a rubber too hard on a piece of paper, tearing through it. It should've been impossible. It didn't even occur to me to try to photograph it, or even let a colleague know of this anomaly. I could only stare. The more I looked, the more I felt as though my seat was sinking. Then it was my entire body, and I was overcome with a sensation I could only describe as vertigo. I haven't experienced it before, but I assume that's what it feels like. Like when you're falling asleep and your body gives you the sensation that you're falling. But this was different. This was real.

It felt as though I was sitting there for days, but it could only have been about twenty minutes or so. I know this because there was still people around. As I basked in that almost meditative state of the void, \*l'appel du vide,\* I've heard some call it, an irritating noise cut through my trance. To call it irritating is an understatement, but I don't have any other words to describe it. Annoying, yes, but also deeply frustrating. Like nails on a chalkboard. I managed to tear my gaze away to look up at my colleague. Staring down at me with those stupid, vacant eyes everyone seems to have. I don't remember his name, the classes are huge, I believe it was Tom. It doesn't matter too much. Nobody really does. 

Tom stared at me with something akin to pity, or maybe concern, either way I felt sick. Started asking me what I was doing, that it was getting late, if I wanted a coffee or for him to walk me back to my dorm. That it was dangerous, especially for someone like me. I know what he meant by ""someone like me."" I wanted him to die. No, not die. You still exist when you die, even if you just turn into a smelly carcass. I wanted him to disappear. 

I'm not sure what compelled me to do this. But I remembered the hole in the sky. Before I could think too hard about it, I told him to look out as well. As if I were asking for guidance. Of course, he complied. The next thing... Well, I'm not sure how to put it into words, but I'll try my best. My wish was granted. He disappeared. He fell, but he didn't fall down, he just fell. Into existence. Into space. Like the air surrounding us folded into itself. There wasn't so much as a noise. He was just gone. As small as I had felt all my life. Invisible. I think he was still there, just... In the same way a singular particle is still there in the quantum universe. 

I never heard of Tom again. He never came back to class, not that I missed him. The thing is that nobody asked about him either. I figured people were simply as disinterested in his whereabouts as I was, but after two months I did find it slightly strange how nobody brought him up. I wasn't concerned, but I was curious. So I checked the alumni in Cosmology. As strange as it is, given I've forgotten his name altogether, I know for certain he wasn't listed. He was gone for good. Just like I wanted. 

I've continued my research on supermassive black holes since then, and I've realised I'm much more at peace as of late. Nobody bothers me in the observatory anymore. And as of right now, nobody has brought up the fact that there's only six people in the class.

# Prologue: Professor B.S.

Professor B.S. suffered from eternal insomnia. He sat before his television screen, far too alert.

**3:21.**

An interesting hour. Even more so when read in reverse. A basketball game murmured in the background, entirely irrelevant.

B.S. was contemplating the critical ethics of eating during a lecture. Not the students eating; that was perfectly legitimate in his eyes. He was thinking about the lecturer eating, mid-presentation. Nothing heavy, like beef and potatoes. Something light. A pleasant little salad. Perhaps a can of something carbonated on the side. But the students might take offense. The pretentious ones would likely file a complaint with the faculty.

*Ridiculous. It’s for their own benefit,* B.S. mused.

It would allow him to survive the mid-lecture hypoglycemia and bring the entire performance to a crescendo.

Perhaps he could bring in a patient while he was at it. Well, at least an actor. He could demonstrate meningeal signs on them - bend the neck until they screamed their soul out in pain.

Unpleasant.

Meningitis is undeniably unpleasant. Fortunately, only the actor must suffer.

Professor B.S. considered breaking his routine tomorrow to perform a ward round. A 'Peacock Walk,' just to remind everyone he was still among the living. Perhaps he would bark at someone regarding a botched chest X-ray interpretation, or, more amusingly, offer a rare word of praise to the department’s most incompetent resident. It was always good for a laugh.

The mere thought caused a twitch in his left flank. Or his right. Or both. Dealing with the actual practice of medicine was a dangerous business. Too demanding. Better to stick to lectures and remain entombed in his office. The air conditioning was sublime this time of year. Airy weather.

It was already four in the morning. Not good; sleep was no longer an option. Better to get dressed and brew some coffee. The morning would arrive soon enough.

# Chapter 1 – Beep. Beep. Beep.

**Beep. Beep. Beep.**

White noise.

**Beep. Beep. Beep.**

White noise.

Dr. Eran Datner, the miserable resident on duty in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at 'Sharona' Hospital, glanced at his watch. 3:23. A digital watch. A toy for the new generation. He disliked the time staring back at him, something too symmetrical about it. Either too early to get up or far too late.

In any case, he wondered why he had woken up. The background drone of the monitors was a poor excuse. It was barely audible from behind the on-call room door in the NICU. It must be something else.

**Ring. Ring. Ring.**

The phone. The nurse Susan. Susan Schell.

That never meant anything good.

That American only spoke up to rant about vaccines or bark about resuscitation.

**Resuscitation**.

He leapt out of bed, nearly forgetting to put on his shoes, and bolted from the room. His thinning hair was disheveled, and he was wholly dazed and bewildered. He did not know what awaited him.

\*\*\*

Datner nearly stumbled over the nurses' desk before truly opening his eyes. He felt sour. Like a lemon squeezed into a margarita that had sat in the sun for far too long.

He knew what he had to do.

Too late.

Washing his face now would make the nurses look at him strangely. Combing his hair was out of the question; he had never owned a comb (he knew he did not have much to comb anyway). It was time for action.

Room 11.

The resuscitation in Room 11.

Susan had said it explicitly, that unhinged American from hell.

*Too harsh. Just an unhinged American, then. Still tough, though. American, the harshest curse of all.*

**Resuscitation**.

He pulled back the curtain of Room 11.

\*\*\*

A large incubator. Transparent. Horribly generic.

The baby was unmistakably **blue**.

It had a name, but no one cared about that at this stage. At this stage, it wasn't even clear what the baby’s sex was. A few things were clear to Datner now. The monitor above the incubator showed a low oxygen saturation of 76%, and the baby looked distinctly blue.

The pulse and blood pressure were not being read by the monitor, and there were too many nurses around the small incubator. At least three nurses. At least one of them was Susan Schell. That couldn't be good.

Worst of all, the incubator had not yet been opened. That really annoyed him.

He pushed his way past the flustered nurses, opened the incubator, and shouted at Susan - ""The Ambu, now."" He began ventilating. '*Not too hard,*' he recalled the advice of his old mentor, Prof. B.S., '*Gently, so you don’t burst the baby’s lungs.*'

The lungs, surprisingly, did not resist at all. The air pushed by the Ambu flowed easily into the small body, which gradually turned pinker and pinker.

""What are the blood pressure and pulse?"" Datner called out into the air, stifling a small smile at the saturation rising to 99%. *Even better than 100, better symmetry*. The sound the monitor emitted became much more tolerable. Almost melodic. Harmonic. *The Beach Boys* at their peak. *God Only Knows*.

""Still not reading,"" a voice from outer space replied.

That alien irritated Datner.

""Bring me a tube, size 2.5. And a laryngoscope with a small blade,"" he practically grumbled, disappointed by the slow flow of the event.

He did not fail to notice that Susan was working flawlessly. With all her faults, she was still quite experienced. She handed him the laryngoscope and the tube.

He put down the Ambu and inserted the laryngoscope.

'*Straight up at a right angle. With the patient’s eyes facing the ceiling,*' he recalled another piece of advice from Prof. B.S. Advice for all time. A Man for all seasons.

He wondered where B.S. was now.

Probably sitting at home watching TV and getting annoyed about his low salary. Who watches TV at this hour? Is the man a psychopath?!

Never mind. Moving on.

The vocal cords were clearly visible. A piece of cake. He inserted the tube quickly. Now, fixation.

This was the part he hated. He always felt the nurses would cause him to pull out the tube at that moment. Susan, however, didn't panic. ""At 9.5 centimeters, Doctor?"" she asked, almost affectionately.

""Yes,"" he mumbled, slightly surprised by her positive approach. He connected the Ambu to the tube and squeezed gently, compressing the small bellows only slightly, so as not to burst the lungs.

Meanwhile, the pulse returned. Approximately.

The monitor showed something that looked approximately like an ECG tracing in Lead 2. Not quite.

*The stickers! They had fallen off the baby’s chest. Nurse Miri was attaching them now. Other than that, she was useless. She should learn from Susan.*

Pulse 150. A small smile.

""And blood pressure?"" Datner almost whispered.

""Wait, I'm changing the cuff, the previous one is too big,"" Susan answered. He *almost* began to like her. Not really, but still, a little, given the situation and the alternatives. Better unhinged and efficient than sane and harmful.

Another half a minute passed. Thirty seconds is a long time when you are waiting. He began to remember how tired he was. A big yawn. Overt. For everyone to see. The questionable scent of his breath forced him to stop the show. If you eat something after midnight, it’s best not to have it spicy or with a lot of garlic. Crucially, it's best not to have **both** ingredients, Datner noted. Failed note.

Meanwhile, the tube fixation was finished, and he turned to adjust the parameters on the ventilator. He never quite understood how to choose the numbers, the ventilation metrics. Strange names for pressures – ‘PIP’, ‘PEEP’, and all sorts of other 'peeps' ran through his head. He also had pressure in his bladder. A sudden need to urinate. Fortunately, he sorted that out relatively easily here. Almost a coincidence. Dumb luck.

""Blood pressure 60/30,"" Susan cried, almost shouted, in a tone of joy, into the space.

It won't get better than that, Datner decided.

He barely knew what to do with himself now that he was no longer holding the tube or calibrating the ventilator. Nurse Miri smiled. Like a calf that had been given excellent straw.

Nurse Susan was frowning. Despite her advanced age, something of the Southern American beauty in which she had once excelled remained. *The Texas beauty queen forty years ago, no doubt*. He didn't recall her being originally from New York.

""What about Dextro?"" Datner barked.

""Immediately, Doctor,"" Susan replied submissively. She clearly had excellent training and manners that were out of this world. Foreign to the place.

He almost decided to go out to the stairwell and steal a few puffs of a cigarette.

Maybe it is better to update the on-call physician first.

But first, read the chart, he concluded.

He knew nothing about the infant who had just returned to life and certainly didn't know why this delicate creature had nearly collapsed completely. The on-call physician would not like a call about resuscitation without concrete information about the patient. He wasn't even sure if it was a male. He thought he saw testes during the ventilation, but he wasn't prepared to swear to it.

Still, a cigarette first. The on-call physician was certainly asleep now, and there was no reason to rush and call her before everything was known.

The watch showed 3:53. Still too symmetrical.

\*\*\*

""What do you mean, the baby in Room 11 almost died?"" the voice on the other end gasped. Datner wasn't sure if Dr. Katya Pavlichuk, the on-call neonatologist, was shouting or talking in her sleep. Maybe it was a combination of both? And what difference did it make anyway?

""He was perfectly fine this morning when I left him,"" the on-call physician continued, starting to wake up, grumbling about the uninvited wake-up call and the news it brought.

Datner glanced at his watch, 5:15, still symmetrical.

He thought that if he waited long enough, the on-call physician would appreciate the extra sleep time he had allowed her, and it would slightly dull the criticism of his ignorance regarding the chart.

He had tried earlier to read a little in the record, but everything was written in a particularly sloppy handwriting, worse even than his own, and most days there wasn't even a visit note. Only nurses’ comments alongside growth metrics and medication logs.

He gathered it was an infant (it was, after all, a male, those indeed were testes), a **29-week preemie** who had been in the NICU for two weeks, receiving some **TPN** (total parenteral nutrition; nutrition through the vein. The 'T' standing for Total - meaning exclusive IV nutrition, although the baby had already started receiving some formula).

And that was it.

Most of the time, the baby had been idling and lying in the incubator between visits, however many of those were conducted.

This was exactly what the on-call physician, Dr. Katya Pavlichuk, was lecturing him about now.

Datner wasn't really listening. He knew the ways of senior neonatologists. She would dump everything at him, regardless. Better to keep quiet and scowl. Healthier for his coronaries.

After a few more seconds (about two hundred, in Datner's estimation, who had begun to develop a slight, involuntary twitch) of a lecture on the essence of life and the fact that the baby had been perfect that morning when she left, Dr. Katya finally got around to asking something. It sounded like a question. Datner wasn't really listening.

Hello, hello, Datner, are you there?!"" Katya shrieked.

""Yes, certainly,"" Datner replied.

He was entertaining thoughts of early retirement. Considering his age (33, well-balanced), his professional status (a pediatric resident in his third out of four years), and his family status (unhappily married with two daughters who were probably very nice, he didn't really know them), these were premature, idle thoughts.

""How is the baby now? Is he ventilated? Does he need inotropes? Did you take cultures? Did you replace the central line? Did you start antibiotics?""

This was roughly what Dr. Katya rattled off. Datner wasn't really sure he cared.

""The baby is fine, easily ventilated, no inotropes, and no antibiotics,"" he replied, trying to avoid revealing the fact that he had failed to insert a central line and hadn't managed to take more than one blood culture. As for urine and cerebrospinal fluid cultures, forget about it. Let the morning shift do that. They rested all night.

He didn't tell Dr. Katya all of that, of course. She hadn't asked specifically. A small, harmless white lie, in Datner's opinion. She said she would arrive in about two hours (funny, that was the usual time for the morning meeting anyway) and that until then, he should update her if there was anything new. Anything at all.

""Yes, of course,"" Datner answered in an authoritative tone, his thoughts were far less polite.

\*\*\*

Dr. Katya Pavlichuk thought life was once more beautiful. When she was a child, still in Moscow, she dreamed of becoming a doctor. A pediatrician. She had always been the best student in school, the best student in medical school. Until she arrived in Israel. Straight to 'Sharona'.

When she arrived in the country, they told her 'Sharona' Hospital was in the Sharon region, as the name suggests. 'Two minutes from Tel Aviv,' they said. That was a crude lie; the drive was at least thirty minutes from Tel Aviv, and that was only if you drove at night, with zero traffic. No less. It wasn't really in the Sharon either; it was more in the Coastal Plain. She wasn't sure, and anyway, there was no one to complain to. But that’s where they assigned her, and she, being the good girl she was, did as she was instructed.

That was over twenty years ago already. Like another lifetime.

She tried to feel like she belonged from the start, but they didn't exactly make it easy.

For the first time in her life, she wasn't the popular success. She would hear them mocking her strange accent behind her back. Funny, in her eyes, the Israelis at 'Sharona' had the diction of Orientals. Mongolians. Descendants of Genghis Khan. Almost Mongoloid, she thought, a word she knew she shouldn’t be using. She remembered someone once told her that Dr. Down was a vicious, consummate racist. He was the one who gave the name 'Mongoloid' to babies with three sets of chromosomes 21 and slanted eyes. A smart fellow. A great racist, like all puffed-up Brits, but smart. He probably had crooked teeth. All smart Brits had crooked teeth. Even the not-so-smart ones. And they were all racists.

Only Dr. Renana treated her nicely, back then, when she first arrived at 'Sharona'. They became better friends. Renana was still sometimes happy then. Until that incident.

Now, as a veteran, Katya had learned to live in 'Sharona'. She no longer tried to excel. Excellence at 'Sharona' meant a death blow. A sign on your back. A mark of Cain.

She got out of bed and walked toward the bathroom. That Datner, she thought to herself. Couldn't he have waited another hour before telling her about a deteriorating baby?!

And why was the baby deteriorating anyway? He was perfectly fine this morning.

She would blame Datner for everything at the morning meeting. That was good for his character development.

The urine flowed relatively easily. In all cases. For Katya, Datner, and the temporarily stabilized preemie.

Relief.

Dr. Katya did not remember to check why the deteriorating baby was not given antibiotic treatment without reason, or what work-up was done to identify the possible infection. It was as if, in the heat of the events, she missed Datner's answer. Too bad; distraction was uncharacteristic of her.

\*\*\*

# Chapter 2  -  A Collection of Amateurs

""A collection of amateurs,"" I snapped. ""Just a bunch of amateurs. Not a single one of them belongs in a professional organization.""

The phone rang. It always rings in the bathroom, and always while I’m reading an article about the only soccer team I care about, FC ‘Sharona Sharks.’ A team with no luck; a fan with no luck.

I didn't know who was on the line. I’d replaced too many phones in recent years, and when one of the backups crashed, I just stopped trying to sync contacts. My call log was a graveyard of digits. Most names no longer appeared identified, just numbers, like Holocaust survivors. Those who merited a name, everyone deserves one, after all, were usually labeled as ""Blocked,"" ""Do Not Answer,"" ""Do Not Answer 3,"" or the more recent ""Blocked, Do Not Answer Forever. New.""

It was Datner. A pleasant enough fellow. I'd known him since he was a young, enthusiastic student. He was a good man, back during his internship. Pediatric residency hadn't done him any favors. His fair hair had receded and turned a premature gray, and his zest for life had almost completely evaporated. He was no longer light-hearted. I’d even known him while he was mourning his mother, and even then, he was more optimistic than he was now.

""Datner, I'm not a consultant for the NICU. Take your madness elsewhere. I had intended to spend the day in glorious, uninterrupted indolence,"" I shot back before he could even draw breath. Better to set the record straight before the request to claim my soul arrived.

He didn't stop. He was always stubborn. He apologized at length, babbling something incoherent about having been on duty in the NICU three days ago. Now, there were two isolates in a baby’s blood culture. The infectious disease specialist had dismissed it as contamination, but Datner feared it was real. He was truly sorry, he said, but maybe I could take a look?

It sounded like typical nonsense. I told him so. He insisted I come. Even just for five minutes.

I insisted I felt like hell. That was true; I hadn't felt well since the late 1980s. It didn't help. He insisted. The boy was relentless. I told him to shut up and let me drink my coffee, and that I’d be there in fifteen minutes.

""Promise?"" he asked. ""A sailor's promise, diseased with syphilis,"" I replied.

He hung up. Slow to take a hint, that one. But a good guy.

\*\*\*

A few minutes later, I was already nodding my head towards several familiar faces from the past. A gaggle of nurses who I had no idea were still alive. I didn't know any of their names, of course. Except for one, *Susan Schell*, who stood at the edge of the ward, near the kitchenette. ""Is she still alive?"" I wondered internally (or perhaps I shouted it, I'm not sure). She hadn't changed much at all. Maybe a wrinkle here, a white hair there, but still the beautiful Susan. An American from hell.

I adopted what I call my 'Dreamy Genius' expression, the one that says 'don't interrupt my profound thoughts' and strode briskly toward the place of the incubator in question, ignoring the astonished gazes of all the occupants. Datner was already standing there, beside the incubator containing a small body and many tubes.

""The little guy doesn't look good, friend,"" I opened with an immediate taunt.

""Aging fast,"" the impertinent student replied.

""You were somewhat economical with the truth regarding the patient’s status,"" I bristled.

""It happened recently, just this morning,"" Datner tried to defend himself.

A weak, apologetic response. Total surrender.

At this point, I grew tired of the intellectual chess game. More accurately, the easy victory prevented me from feeling any sense of satisfaction, so I decided to get to the point. This way, I would at least significantly cut down on my stay in the NICU, a unit I hadn't tolerated, along with its people, for over sixteen years. I glanced at the patient's chart and even managed to read a few lines before returning to torment Datner. It’s important to arrive prepared for battle; otherwise, there is a danger that the opponent might have a fair chance of success, heaven forbid.

I remember being a young student, not even a resident, when I heard people speaking respectfully about me behind my back. Rumors were circulated about the new genius on the ward, who knew everything during rounds, even before the attending physician. I will reveal the secret of the aforementioned magic to you, even though a proper magician never reveals his secrets. The whole secret lies in arriving half an hour before everyone else, opening all the charts of the new admissions from the night, and memorizing the admission details. Especially numbers of vital signs and selected lab indices. That's it. That’s the whole secret. A little memorization and spurting out the numbers before everyone finishes their coffee, and the title 'genius' is thrown your way without a problem. The art of illusion. The art of the lie.

""So, I see we have a small preemie, ventilated on inotropes, with a borderline pulse and unstable blood pressure, oxygenating with difficulty, and prone to ending his visit on planet Earth. And you say the little prince wasn't like this until your shift?"" I fired quickly. That's always my method. Stun them before they regain their composure.

If the fight is fair, there's a good chance you'll lose. After all, I was in enemy territory.

Datner was about to open his mouth when Dr. Katya appeared behind him.

\*\*\*

""Exactly, Prof. B.S., exactly. Simply appalling. Seventy-two hours ago, this was a completely healthy baby. And now? What a disaster,"" she almost sobbed. *Since when did she get so worked up? I remembered her as a cold fish, not spicy fish stew.*

""How are you, dear Dr. Katya?"" I mustered my most empathetic tone. I remember not tolerating her 20 years ago, when she first arrived at 'Sharona'. She was already a senior, and I was just a young, clueless resident. This whole meeting felt strange and unwelcome to me.

She didn't answer. She considered making a stinging comment but knew I'd fire back immediately. She gave up. Instead, Datner launched into a speech about cultures. I wasn't listening. There was a medical chart next to the incubator, and I picked it up and saw the problem immediately. I silenced Datner with a finger, and immediately burst forth with the following sentence:

""Gram-positive cocci in chains and Gram-positive bacilli. In the same culture. From the same time. Strange. Definitely strange.""

\*\*\*

""What do you say, Datner? Can you explain to Dr. Pavlichuk and me the possibilities in the differential diagnosis?""

Datner puffed out his chest. It was clear he had prepared for this. He launched into a monologue so long it felt like movie exposition.

""Three big possibilities. All of them are quite strange. First, contamination. The two growths are meaningless. This doesn't explain the child's condition, but it eliminates the need to understand the strange culture result."" I smiled; there was an echo of my own words from the past in his reply, it was clear the youth enjoyed quoting me. He continued:

""The second possibility is that only one bacterium is real, and the other is a contaminant. In that case, we need to analyze each possibility regarding each bacterium.""

""And the third possibility?"" I decided to intervene, even though it was completely unnecessary.

""Both bacteria represent real infections, which are not necessarily related, and may not even have been acquired in the same way, but both led to the child's deterioration."" The defense rested.

""I feel almost superfluous here, Datner and Katya. It's clear you've considered all the options. I'm sure you've already discussed the possible identity of the bacteria,"" I said, injecting a hint of mild insult into my words.

""Of course,"" Katya shrieked.

That woman needs sedatives; I decreed to myself. I nearly had a heart attack because of her sudden franticness.

""And?"" I pressed.

""Datner, tell him,"" Katya said, with a semblance of quasi-authoritativeness.

It was clear to me that she was afraid of making a mistake, and even more than that, trembling with fear at the possibility that I would correct her.

""The Streptococci are probably **GBS**,"" Datner began lecturing, ""That's the most common cause of neonatal sepsis, even this late.""

""And...?"" I continued to press.

""It could also be *Enterococcus*, though you taught me that without risk factors, it almost never does anything,"" chirped the visibly unshaven student. This didn't bother me; I had made a point of not arriving clean-shaven at work for over twenty years. I always replied to supervisors' questions about my poor shaving capabilities with the same answer: ""When I have time to sleep, I'll shave and maybe even shower."" I liked Datner's answer, even though he didn't list every possibility in the world. I decided to let it go and not press the point right now. This was uncharacteristic of me.

""And the second bacterium, Datner?"" I continued.

""The second is contamination or *Listeria*,"" he answered.

""Excellent,"" I smiled, ""And what about that entire list of Gram-positive bacilli I taught you a million times? Won't you repeat it for me?"" I purred sweetly.

""*Sure. Listeria*, Diphtheroids including *Diphtheria*, *Actinomyces*, *Nocardia*, *Clostridium*, and something else I forgot,"" Datner rattled off. I must have taught him that at least two hundred times. Or perhaps I'm exaggerating, and it was only six times.

""You forgot *Bacillus*, *Anthrax*, and *Cereus*,"" I fired back conspicuously. After all, I had to make it clear there was only one lion in the room.

""Well, I see you're managing fine without me. What treatment are you giving?"" I began moving toward the exit, carefully projecting indifference.

""Ampicillin, Gentamicin, and Claforan,"" Katya replied. ""To cover all the bases. Dr. Rina Renana advised it - it was started with the first consultation, the morning after the collapse,"" she added, almost apologetically.

She probably thought I would lash out if she left something out. A disgusting thought. I do not believe in violence. I only believe in death and the suffering preceding it. Everything else is debatable.

""Of course, excellent treatment,"" I replied with conspicuous mockery (It's strange they aren't giving empirical *Vancomycin* for a line infection and Gram-positive bacteria, I thought dismissively. That was quite shocking, to be honest) and decided to walk straight toward the exit door. One last fleeting glance at the incubator made it clear to me that this wouldn't end here. This baby wouldn't survive much longer.

I glanced at Dr. Katya's shoes. A ridiculous shade of red. The number **66** on the sneaker. Sixes mirroring each other. Like the word **SOS.** **DAD. MOM. TUT.** Funny. **LOL**.

""Update me on everything, and think about **Vanco**' - it's recommended,"" I shouted on my way out. I knew there was no chance of coming back to this hole.

\*\*\*

In bed at night, I struggled to fall asleep.

When I have trouble sleeping, I count other people’s medical errors. Never my own.

Datner disappointed me. I knew he would disappoint me. He isn't the first of my students to do so. I learned to prepare them for failure from my very first meeting with them. 'I will never be satisfied,' that is how I would open the intimidation speech that brought them into my life. It was also a means of filtering. Those who fled for their lives weren't worth the effort anyway. Unfortunately, those who stayed weren't always worth the whole ordeal either. Datner was actually fine. But *not* starting antibiotics during the night? What is wrong with him?! I explicitly taught him, always love the patient. Always look for what can be done to improve their condition. Even slightly. No matter how irritating his mother is. Especially if his mother is irritating and hysterical. They are always right.

I wondered what possibilities he considered when he decided not to treat with antibiotics. Obviously, he didn't think of sepsis. Maybe he thought the deterioration was purely respiratory? Or neurological? What an odd decision. It looks like laziness. At least he performed the differential diagnosis of the Gram-positive bacteria well. I wonder if he sat and prepared for my arrival, reading again from the textbook that is completely abandoned during residency. Of course, he did.

I expected nothing from Dr. Katya. She always seemed to me like a useless ornamental foliage. Another background figure in the avant-garde post-modern painting called 'Sharona'.

But Dr. Renana, despite her constant depression, should have started Vancomycin. That woman doesn't think straight. Foggy brain, like a second-year student on a third exam attempt. A special session for special people.

The poor medical charting in the NICU was no surprise at all. It hadn't changed since I was a resident there. A good place to sleep at night, unless triplets were born at 26 weeks. Then a sleepless *white night* is in store for you. The meaning of the expression *'white* *night*' is, of course, *black night*'.

I was sure I would hear more about the case being managed with such meticulousness that no mistake was missed. I regretted discovering very quickly that I was right.

\*\*\*

# Chapter 3 - The Traffic Jams at the Hospital Entrance

The traffic jams at the hospital entrance did not suit Professor Magen Ra'anan. The Acting Director of 'Sharona' Hospital found it intolerable that someone of his stature should wait in traffic with common mortals. He almost considered honking but stopped himself. Who knows, perhaps there was a resident stuck in the entrance traffic jam. Even the guard, who recognized him from afar, a hundred meters off, knew him and could tell his friends about it. Unpleasant.

Professor Magen Ra'anan, whom no one ever called Magen, and no one remembered what he specialized in (Nephrology), finally arrived at the parking lot. He recalled how much he despised the other members of management, **his** management, technically. Well, technically, he was only the **Acting** Director. But he had been the Acting Director for many years. In practice, he was the Director. Obviously. The doctors' parking lot was full of visitors' cars. There were always visitors. Thousands of visitors. None of them had ever learned how to park. Handbrake.

Professor Ra'anan had a mustache. Since forever, always a mustache, ever since his Bar Mitzvah. Initially, it was a boy's fuzz. A thin, light down. Embarrassing in its prematurity. He didn't shave it until his enlistment and had gotten used to the look. Subsequently, for years he had a 'broom' mustache. Like a generic tough British sergeant in recruitment posters. But when he became the Acting Director, he trimmed the mustache slightly to look more respectable. Something in the style of a 19th-century Viennese intellectual. The mustache served, therefore, as a constant disguise. Occasionally changing in character, but perpetually on his face. A mark of Cain.

Ra'anan got out of the car, struggling to step on his right foot, a memory of a car accident he had as a child. He had always refused to use a cane. He would not look like a disabled person. Ra'anan made sure, as was his habit, to check all the doors and wheels, attempting to see if anyone had recently vandalized his car. He would perform this check every time he entered or exited the car. Like a paranoid investor awaiting catastrophe. He would always find a new scratch on the corner of the door, or a key mark etched below the window. It seemed that the entire world aimed only to harm him and his new car. Always a new car.

Phone. A strange sound, Jamaican sounding. '*Oh, baby, I love your way, every day*.' The ringtone and the gloomy phone owner were in a relationship that could only be described as cognitive dissonance.

""Hello? Hello? Who is it? I can't hear anything,"" Magen shrieked, almost automatically, without verifying that he was actually having trouble hearing his interlocutor. ""NICU? From the spokesperson's office? Alright, alright, a few minutes, I'm already in the parking lot, I'll arrive when I arrive."" Disconnection. He had a heavy Argentinian accent. The word 'Spokesperson's' sounded more like *Spokesperrrrson's*.

*'Damn it*,' he muttered, fully aware that he was the only witness to his display of frustration. He would have to visit the NICU and speak with the spokesperson. Too much trouble.

He preferred to do what he had done for the last thirty years. Idling in front of the computer. He would organize the articles on the news sites by interest. Every site had its own arrangement. Politics next to sports, gossip next to cooking. 'It passes the long hours of morning rounds nicely,' he often thought to himself. Not that he remembered what rounds looked like. Every time he volunteered to do one in recent years, he would find himself bored in the very first room. Worse, he didn't know what the residents were talking about or what they wanted from his life. Their questions were boring, stupid, or ones he didn't know the answer to. The latter kind was stressful. He skipped more and more of the little he did. Better to focus on mock meetings and organizing web articles. It was more respectable and suited his status.

To the NICU. He would certainly impress them, those cowards. All the doctors there were professional sycophants, especially the hysterical Dr. Katya and her even more hysterical Director. He liked that unit, a collection of chickens. But first, to his room on the second floor. A short tour of the wards before the day began. It conveyed an impression of professionalism and attention to every detail. Very important, he reflected, very important.

\*\*\*

The tour of the various wards was quick and uninteresting. Even in Ward C of Pediatrics, there was nothing interesting. An unfamiliar resident on call (whom Ra'anan thought might be a family medicine resident but was actually a confused intern who had agreed to be on call that night, despite the objections of the ward attending). In Ward F of Pediatrics, however, he saw an interesting chart on the desk. ""**Bar'el**."" That's quite a name from the past. Where did they pull him from?! Bar'el was a doctor who used to work for him, long ago. Until about 11 years ago. Or maybe 22 years. It wasn't clear. Probably 15 years, or some similarly asymmetrical number.

Ra'anan hated Bar'el. The filthy loser, who ran off to America and took Ilana and everything with him.

It must be a different Bar'el, and he’s just getting annoyed for nothing. What are the chances? He dismissed the thought.

He didn't notice that he forgot to visit the last ward, jumped on his way to the NICU via the Emergency Room, and disappeared behind the elevator next to the big green dumpster.

To the NICU!

\*\*\*

""What do you mean the journalist Sigal Segal wants to talk to me?"" Professor Ra'anan exclaimed, ""What do I have to do with her?"" he added. His mustache prickled, as if it were a barometer predicting changes in air pressure. The mustache informed Ra'anan that the pressure gauge had risen.

""She said you'd remember her from the previous Listeria outbreak in the NICU,"" answered Sarah Shabbat, the head nurse of the Pediatric Division, as she tried to hide behind the spokesperson's shoulders.

This answer struck Ra'anan in the gut. He was not prepared for this painful reminder. So many years had passed, but the mere mention of the topic caused him considerable abdominal discomfort. He would have to make an excuse and go to the bathroom in the next few minutes. This pressure would have to be released - from above or below. How, for God's sake, did Segal find out about a new *Listeria* growth in the NICU? The lab released the result less than three hours ago. Someone is 'singing' to her, Ra'anan decided.

In any case, the need to maintain composure and a dignified façade caused him to reply dryly: ""I will handle it.""

He would have preferred to have his teeth pulled without anesthesia, or to participate in Russian roulette with five bullets and one empty chamber. Still a non-negligible chance of survival. Professor Ra'anan didn't know how to calculate that chance. It was an 83% chance of death. Still better on the scale of horror compared to certain death in a conversation with a nosy journalist.

Meanwhile, he swallowed some saliva and half-shrieked, half-called out in a voice that tried to sound authoritative but came out sounding like a distress signal, ""Has anyone seen Dr. [Renana]()?""

# Prologue: Professor B.S.

Professor B.S. suffered from eternal insomnia. He sat before his television screen, far too alert.

3:21.

An interesting hour. Even more so when read in reverse. A basketball game murmured in the background, entirely irrelevant.

B.S. was contemplating the critical ethics of eating during a lecture. Not the students eating; that was perfectly legitimate in his eyes. He was thinking about the lecturer eating, mid-presentation. Nothing heavy, like beef and potatoes. Something light. A pleasant little salad. Perhaps a can of something carbonated on the side. But the students might take offense. The pretentious ones would likely file a complaint with the faculty.

Ridiculous. It’s for their own benefit, B.S. mused.

It would allow him to survive the mid-lecture hypoglycemia and bring the entire performance to a crescendo.

Perhaps he could bring in a patient while he was at it. Well, at least an actor. He could demonstrate meningeal signs on them - bend the neck until they screamed their soul out in pain.

Unpleasant.

Meningitis is undeniably unpleasant. Fortunately, only the actor must suffer.

Professor B.S. considered breaking his routine tomorrow to perform a ward round. A 'Peacock Walk,' just to remind everyone he was still among the living. Perhaps he would bark at someone regarding a botched chest X-ray interpretation, or, more amusingly, offer a rare word of praise to the department’s most incompetent resident. It was always good for a laugh.

The mere thought caused a twitch in his left flank. Or his right. Or both. Dealing with the actual practice of medicine was a dangerous business. Too demanding. Better to stick to lectures and remain entombed in his office. The air conditioning was sublime this time of year. Airy weather.

It was already four in the morning. Not good; sleep was no longer an option. Better to get dressed and brew some coffee. The morning would arrive soon enough.

\*\*\*

# Chapter 1 – Beep. Beep. Beep.

Beep. Beep. Beep.

White noise.

Beep. Beep. Beep.

White noise.

Dr. Eran Datner, the miserable resident on duty in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at 'Sharona' Hospital, glanced at his watch. 3:23. A digital watch. A toy for the new generation. He disliked the time staring back at him, something too symmetrical about it. Either too early to get up or far too late.

In any case, he wondered why he had woken up. The background drone of the monitors was a poor excuse. It was barely audible from behind the on-call room door in the NICU. It must be something else.

Ring. Ring. Ring.

The phone. The nurse Susan. Susan Schell.

That never meant anything good.

That American only spoke up to rant about vaccines or bark about resuscitation.

Resuscitation.

He leapt out of bed, nearly forgetting to put on his shoes, and bolted from the room. His thinning hair was disheveled, and he was wholly dazed and bewildered. He did not know what awaited him.

\*\*\*

Datner nearly stumbled over the nurses' desk before truly opening his eyes. He felt sour. Like a lemon squeezed into a margarita that had sat in the sun for far too long.

He knew what he had to do.

Too late.

Washing his face now would make the nurses look at him strangely. Combing his hair was out of the question; he had never owned a comb (he knew he did not have much to comb anyway). It was time for action.

Room 11.

The resuscitation in Room 11.

Susan had said it explicitly, that unhinged American from hell.

Too harsh. Just an unhinged American, then. Still tough, though. American, the harshest curse of all.

Resuscitation.

He pulled back the curtain of Room 11.

\*\*\*

A large incubator. Transparent. Horribly generic.

The baby was unmistakably blue.

It had a name, but no one cared about that at this stage. At this stage, it wasn't even clear what the baby’s sex was. A few things were clear to Datner now. The monitor above the incubator showed a low oxygen saturation of 76%, and the baby looked distinctly blue.

The pulse and blood pressure were not being read by the monitor, and there were too many nurses around the small incubator. At least three nurses. At least one of them was Susan Schell. That couldn't be good.

Worst of all, the incubator had not yet been opened. That really annoyed him.

He pushed his way past the flustered nurses, opened the incubator, and shouted at Susan - ""The Ambu, now."" He began ventilating. 'Not too hard,' he recalled the advice of his old mentor, Prof. B.S., 'Gently, so you don’t burst the baby’s lungs.'

The lungs, surprisingly, did not resist at all. The air pushed by the Ambu flowed easily into the small body, which gradually turned pinker and pinker.

""What are the blood pressure and pulse?"" Datner called out into the air, stifling a small smile at the saturation rising to 99%. Even better than 100, better symmetry. The sound the monitor emitted became much more tolerable. Almost melodic. Harmonic. The Beach Boys at their peak. God Only Knows.

""Still not reading,"" a voice from outer space replied.

That alien irritated Datner.

""Bring me a tube, size 2.5. And a laryngoscope with a small blade,"" he practically grumbled, disappointed by the slow flow of the event.

He did not fail to notice that Susan was working flawlessly. With all her faults, she was still quite experienced. She handed him the laryngoscope and the tube.

He put down the Ambu and inserted the laryngoscope.

'Straight up at a right angle. With the patient’s eyes facing the ceiling,' he recalled another piece of advice from Prof. B.S. Advice for all time. A Man for all seasons.

He wondered where B.S. was now.

Probably sitting at home watching TV and getting annoyed about his low salary. Who watches TV at this hour? Is the man a psychopath?!

Never mind. Moving on.

The vocal cords were clearly visible. A piece of cake. He inserted the tube quickly. Now, fixation.

This was the part he hated. He always felt the nurses would cause him to pull out the tube at that moment. Susan, however, didn't panic. ""At 9.5 centimeters, Doctor?"" she asked, almost affectionately.

""Yes,"" he mumbled, slightly surprised by her positive approach. He connected the Ambu to the tube and squeezed gently, compressing the small bellows only slightly, so as not to burst the lungs.

Meanwhile, the pulse returned. Approximately.

The monitor showed something that looked approximately like an ECG tracing in Lead 2. Not quite.

The stickers! They had fallen off the baby’s chest. Nurse Miri was attaching them now. Other than that, she was useless. She should learn from Susan.

Pulse 150. A small smile.

""And blood pressure?"" Datner almost whispered.

""Wait, I'm changing the cuff, the previous one is too big,"" Susan answered. He almost began to like her. Not really, but still, a little, given the situation and the alternatives. Better unhinged and efficient than sane and harmful.

Another half a minute passed. Thirty seconds is a long time when you are waiting. He began to remember how tired he was. A big yawn. Overt. For everyone to see. The questionable scent of his breath forced him to stop the show. If you eat something after midnight, it’s best not to have it spicy or with a lot of garlic. Crucially, it's best not to have both ingredients, Datner noted. Failed note.

Meanwhile, the tube fixation was finished, and he turned to adjust the parameters on the ventilator. He never quite understood how to choose the numbers, the ventilation metrics. Strange names for pressures – ‘PIP’, ‘PEEP’, and all sorts of other 'peeps' ran through his head. He also had pressure in his bladder. A sudden need to urinate. Fortunately, he sorted that out relatively easily here. Almost a coincidence. Dumb luck.

""Blood pressure 60/30,"" Susan cried, almost shouted, in a tone of joy, into the space.

It won't get better than that, Datner decided.

He barely knew what to do with himself now that he was no longer holding the tube or calibrating the ventilator. Nurse Miri smiled. Like a calf that had been given excellent straw.

Nurse Susan was frowning. Despite her advanced age, something of the Southern American beauty in which she had once excelled remained. The Texas beauty queen forty years ago, no doubt. He didn't recall her being originally from New York.

""What about Dextro?"" Datner barked.

""Immediately, Doctor,"" Susan replied submissively. She clearly had excellent training and manners that were out of this world. Foreign to the place.

He almost decided to go out to the stairwell and steal a few puffs of a cigarette.

Maybe it is better to update the on-call physician first.

But first, read the chart, he concluded.

He knew nothing about the infant who had just returned to life and certainly didn't know why this delicate creature had nearly collapsed completely. The on-call physician would not like a call about resuscitation without concrete information about the patient. He wasn't even sure if it was a male. He thought he saw testes during the ventilation, but he wasn't prepared to swear to it.

Still, a cigarette first. The on-call physician was certainly asleep now, and there was no reason to rush and call her before everything was known.

The watch showed 3:53. Still too symmetrical.

\*\*\*

""What do you mean, the baby in Room 11 almost died?"" the voice on the other end gasped. Datner wasn't sure if Dr. Katya Pavlichuk, the on-call neonatologist, was shouting or talking in her sleep. Maybe it was a combination of both? And what difference did it make anyway?

""He was perfectly fine this morning when I left him,"" the on-call physician continued, starting to wake up, grumbling about the uninvited wake-up call and the news it brought.

Datner glanced at his watch, 5:15, still symmetrical.

He thought that if he waited long enough, the on-call physician would appreciate the extra sleep time he had allowed her, and it would slightly dull the criticism of his ignorance regarding the chart.

He had tried earlier to read a little in the record, but everything was written in a particularly sloppy handwriting, worse even than his own, and most days there wasn't even a visit note. Only nurses’ comments alongside growth metrics and medication logs.

He gathered it was an infant (it was, after all, a male, those indeed were testes), a 29-week preemie who had been in the NICU for two weeks, receiving some TPN (total parenteral nutrition; nutrition through the vein. The 'T' standing for Total - meaning exclusive IV nutrition, although the baby had already started receiving some formula).

And that was it.

Most of the time, the baby had been idling and lying in the incubator between visits, however many of those were conducted.

This was exactly what the on-call physician, Dr. Katya Pavlichuk, was lecturing him about now.

Datner wasn't really listening. He knew the ways of senior neonatologists. She would dump everything at him, regardless. Better to keep quiet and scowl. Healthier for his coronaries.

After a few more seconds (about two hundred, in Datner's estimation, who had begun to develop a slight, involuntary twitch) of a lecture on the essence of life and the fact that the baby had been perfect that morning when she left, Dr. Katya finally got around to asking something. It sounded like a question. Datner wasn't really listening.

Hello, hello, Datner, are you there?!"" Katya shrieked.

""Yes, certainly,"" Datner replied.

He was entertaining thoughts of early retirement. Considering his age (33, well-balanced), his professional status (a pediatric resident in his third out of four years), and his family status (unhappily married with two daughters who were probably very nice, he didn't really know them), these were premature, idle thoughts.

""How is the baby now? Is he ventilated? Does he need inotropes? Did you take cultures? Did you replace the central line? Did you start antibiotics?""

This was roughly what Dr. Katya rattled off. Datner wasn't really sure he cared.

""The baby is fine, easily ventilated, no inotropes, and no antibiotics,"" he replied, trying to avoid revealing the fact that he had failed to insert a central line and hadn't managed to take more than one blood culture. As for urine and cerebrospinal fluid cultures, forget about it. Let the morning shift do that. They rested all night.

He didn't tell Dr. Katya all of that, of course. She hadn't asked specifically. A small, harmless white lie, in Datner's opinion. She said she would arrive in about two hours (funny, that was the usual time for the morning meeting anyway) and that until then, he should update her if there was anything new. Anything at all.

""Yes, of course,"" Datner answered in an authoritative tone, his thoughts were far less polite.

\*\*\*

Dr. Katya Pavlichuk thought life was once more beautiful. When she was a child, still in Moscow, she dreamed of becoming a doctor. A pediatrician. She had always been the best student in school, the best student in medical school. Until she arrived in Israel. Straight to 'Sharona'.

When she arrived in the country, they told her 'Sharona' Hospital was in the Sharon region, as the name suggests. 'Two minutes from Tel Aviv,' they said. That was a crude lie; the drive was at least thirty minutes from Tel Aviv, and that was only if you drove at night, with zero traffic. No less. It wasn't really in the Sharon either; it was more in the Coastal Plain. She wasn't sure, and anyway, there was no one to complain to. But that’s where they assigned her, and she, being the good girl she was, did as she was instructed.

That was over twenty years ago already. Like another lifetime.

She tried to feel like she belonged from the start, but they didn't exactly make it easy.

For the first time in her life, she wasn't the popular success. She would hear them mocking her strange accent behind her back. Funny, in her eyes, the Israelis at 'Sharona' had the diction of Orientals. Mongolians. Descendants of Genghis Khan. Almost Mongoloid, she thought, a word she knew she shouldn’t be using. She remembered someone once told her that Dr. Down was a vicious, consummate racist. He was the one who gave the name 'Mongoloid' to babies with three sets of chromosomes 21 and slanted eyes. A smart fellow. A great racist, like all puffed-up Brits, but smart. He probably had crooked teeth. All smart Brits had crooked teeth. Even the not-so-smart ones. And they were all racists.

Only Dr. Renana treated her nicely, back then, when she first arrived at 'Sharona'. They became better friends. Renana was still sometimes happy then. Until that incident.

Now, as a veteran, Katya had learned to live in 'Sharona'. She no longer tried to excel. Excellence at 'Sharona' meant a death blow. A sign on your back. A mark of Cain.

She got out of bed and walked toward the bathroom. That Datner, she thought to herself. Couldn't he have waited another hour before telling her about a deteriorating baby?!

And why was the baby deteriorating anyway? He was perfectly fine this morning.

She would blame Datner for everything at the morning meeting. That was good for his character development.

The urine flowed relatively easily. In all cases. For Katya, Datner, and the temporarily stabilized preemie.

Relief.

Dr. Katya did not remember to check why the deteriorating baby was not given antibiotic treatment without reason, or what work-up was done to identify the possible infection. It was as if, in the heat of the events, she missed Datner's answer. Too bad; distraction was uncharacteristic of her.

\*\*\*

# Chapter 2  -  A Collection of Amateurs

""A collection of amateurs,"" I snapped. ""Just a bunch of amateurs. Not a single one of them belongs in a professional organization.""

The phone rang. It always rings in the bathroom, and always while I’m reading an article about the only soccer team I care about, FC ‘Sharona Sharks.’ A team with no luck; a fan with no luck.

I didn't know who was on the line. I’d replaced too many phones in recent years, and when one of the backups crashed, I just stopped trying to sync contacts. My call log was a graveyard of digits. Most names no longer appeared identified, just numbers, like Holocaust survivors. Those who merited a name, everyone deserves one, after all, were usually labeled as ""Blocked,"" ""Do Not Answer,"" ""Do Not Answer 3,"" or the more recent ""Blocked, Do Not Answer Forever. New.""

It was Datner. A pleasant enough fellow. I'd known him since he was a young, enthusiastic student. He was a good man, back during his internship. Pediatric residency hadn't done him any favors. His fair hair had receded and turned a premature gray, and his zest for life had almost completely evaporated. He was no longer light-hearted. I’d even known him while he was mourning his mother, and even then, he was more optimistic than he was now.

""Datner, I'm not a consultant for the NICU. Take your madness elsewhere. I had intended to spend the day in glorious, uninterrupted indolence,"" I shot back before he could even draw breath. Better to set the record straight before the request to claim my soul arrived.

He didn't stop. He was always stubborn. He apologized at length, babbling something incoherent about having been on duty in the NICU three days ago. Now, there were two isolates in a baby’s blood culture. The infectious disease specialist had dismissed it as contamination, but Datner feared it was real. He was truly sorry, he said, but maybe I could take a look?

It sounded like typical nonsense. I told him so. He insisted I come. Even just for five minutes.

I insisted I felt like hell. That was true; I hadn't felt well since the late 1980s. It didn't help. He insisted. The boy was relentless. I told him to shut up and let me drink my coffee, and that I’d be there in fifteen minutes.

""Promise?"" he asked. ""A sailor's promise, diseased with syphilis,"" I replied.

He hung up. Slow to take a hint, that one. But a good guy.

\*\*\*

A few minutes later, I was already nodding my head towards several familiar faces from the past. A gaggle of nurses who I had no idea were still alive. I didn't know any of their names, of course. Except for one, Susan Schell, who stood at the edge of the ward, near the kitchenette. ""Is she still alive?"" I wondered internally (or perhaps I shouted it, I'm not sure). She hadn't changed much at all. Maybe a wrinkle here, a white hair there, but still the beautiful Susan. An American from hell.

I adopted what I call my 'Dreamy Genius' expression, the one that says 'don't interrupt my profound thoughts' and strode briskly toward the place of the incubator in question, ignoring the astonished gazes of all the occupants. Datner was already standing there, beside the incubator containing a small body and many tubes.

""The little guy doesn't look good, friend,"" I opened with an immediate taunt.

""Aging fast,"" the impertinent student replied.

""You were somewhat economical with the truth regarding the patient’s status,"" I bristled.

""It happened recently, just this morning,"" Datner tried to defend himself.

A weak, apologetic response. Total surrender.

At this point, I grew tired of the intellectual chess game. More accurately, the easy victory prevented me from feeling any sense of satisfaction, so I decided to get to the point. This way, I would at least significantly cut down on my stay in the NICU, a unit I hadn't tolerated, along with its people, for over sixteen years. I glanced at the patient's chart and even managed to read a few lines before returning to torment Datner. It’s important to arrive prepared for battle; otherwise, there is a danger that the opponent might have a fair chance of success, heaven forbid.

I remember being a young student, not even a resident, when I heard people speaking respectfully about me behind my back. Rumors were circulated about the new genius on the ward, who knew everything during rounds, even before the attending physician. I will reveal the secret of the aforementioned magic to you, even though a proper magician never reveals his secrets. The whole secret lies in arriving half an hour before everyone else, opening all the charts of the new admissions from the night, and memorizing the admission details. Especially numbers of vital signs and selected lab indices. That's it. That’s the whole secret. A little memorization and spurting out the numbers before everyone finishes their coffee, and the title 'genius' is thrown your way without a problem. The art of illusion. The art of the lie.

""So, I see we have a small preemie, ventilated on inotropes, with a borderline pulse and unstable blood pressure, oxygenating with difficulty, and prone to ending his visit on planet Earth. And you say the little prince wasn't like this until your shift?"" I fired quickly. That's always my method. Stun them before they regain their composure.

If the fight is fair, there's a good chance you'll lose. After all, I was in enemy territory.

Datner was about to open his mouth when Dr. Katya appeared behind him.

\*\*\*

""Exactly, Prof. B.S., exactly. Simply appalling. Seventy-two hours ago, this was a completely healthy baby. And now? What a disaster,"" she almost sobbed. Since when did she get so worked up? I remembered her as a cold fish, not spicy fish stew.

""How are you, dear Dr. Katya?"" I mustered my most empathetic tone. I remember not tolerating her 20 years ago, when she first arrived at 'Sharona'. She was already a senior, and I was just a young, clueless resident. This whole meeting felt strange and unwelcome to me.

She didn't answer. She considered making a stinging comment but knew I'd fire back immediately. She gave up. Instead, Datner launched into a speech about cultures. I wasn't listening. There was a medical chart next to the incubator, and I picked it up and saw the problem immediately. I silenced Datner with a finger, and immediately burst forth with the following sentence:

""Gram-positive cocci in chains and Gram-positive bacilli. In the same culture. From the same time. Strange. Definitely strange.""

\*\*\*

""What do you say, Datner? Can you explain to Dr. Pavlichuk and me the possibilities in the differential diagnosis?""

Datner puffed out his chest. It was clear he had prepared for this. He launched into a monologue so long it felt like movie exposition.

""Three big possibilities. All of them are quite strange. First, contamination. The two growths are meaningless. This doesn't explain the child's condition, but it eliminates the need to understand the strange culture result."" I smiled; there was an echo of my own words from the past in his reply, it was clear the youth enjoyed quoting me. He continued:

""The second possibility is that only one bacterium is real, and the other is a contaminant. In that case, we need to analyze each possibility regarding each bacterium.""

""And the third possibility?"" I decided to intervene, even though it was completely unnecessary.

""Both bacteria represent real infections, which are not necessarily related, and may not even have been acquired in the same way, but both led to the child's deterioration."" The defense rested.

""I feel almost superfluous here, Datner and Katya. It's clear you've considered all the options. I'm sure you've already discussed the possible identity of the bacteria,"" I said, injecting a hint of mild insult into my words.

""Of course,"" Katya shrieked.

That woman needs sedatives; I decreed to myself. I nearly had a heart attack because of her sudden franticness.

""And?"" I pressed.

""Datner, tell him,"" Katya said, with a semblance of quasi-authoritativeness.

It was clear to me that she was afraid of making a mistake, and even more than that, trembling with fear at the possibility that I would correct her.

""The Streptococci are probably GBS,"" Datner began lecturing, ""That's the most common cause of neonatal sepsis, even this late.""

""And...?"" I continued to press.

""It could also be Enterococcus, though you taught me that without risk factors, it almost never does anything,"" chirped the visibly unshaven student. This didn't bother me; I had made a point of not arriving clean-shaven at work for over twenty years. I always replied to supervisors' questions about my poor shaving capabilities with the same answer: ""When I have time to sleep, I'll shave and maybe even shower."" I liked Datner's answer, even though he didn't list every possibility in the world. I decided to let it go and not press the point right now. This was uncharacteristic of me.

""And the second bacterium, Datner?"" I continued.

""The second is contamination or Listeria,"" he answered.

""Excellent,"" I smiled, ""And what about that entire list of Gram-positive bacilli I taught you a million times? Won't you repeat it for me?"" I purred sweetly.

""Sure. Listeria, Diphtheroids including Diphtheria, Actinomyces, Nocardia, Clostridium, and something else I forgot,"" Datner rattled off. I must have taught him that at least two hundred times. Or perhaps I'm exaggerating, and it was only six times.

""You forgot Bacillus, Anthrax, and Cereus,"" I fired back conspicuously. After all, I had to make it clear there was only one lion in the room.

""Well, I see you're managing fine without me. What treatment are you giving?"" I began moving toward the exit, carefully projecting indifference.

""Ampicillin, Gentamicin, and Claforan,"" Katya replied. ""To cover all the bases. Dr. Rina Renana advised it - it was started with the first consultation, the morning after the collapse,"" she added, almost apologetically.

She probably thought I would lash out if she left something out. A disgusting thought. I do not believe in violence. I only believe in death and the suffering preceding it. Everything else is debatable.

""Of course, excellent treatment,"" I replied with conspicuous mockery (It's strange they aren't giving empirical Vancomycin for a line infection and Gram-positive bacteria, I thought dismissively. That was quite shocking, to be honest) and decided to walk straight toward the exit door. One last fleeting glance at the incubator made it clear to me that this wouldn't end here. This baby wouldn't survive much longer.

I glanced at Dr. Katya's shoes. A ridiculous shade of red. The number 66 on the sneaker. Sixes mirroring each other. Like the word SOS. DAD. MOM. TUT. Funny. LOL.

""Update me on everything, and think about Vanco' - it's recommended,"" I shouted on my way out. I knew there was no chance of coming back to this hole.

\*\*\*

In bed at night, I struggled to fall asleep.

When I have trouble sleeping, I count other people’s medical errors. Never my own.

Datner disappointed me. I knew he would disappoint me. He isn't the first of my students to do so. I learned to prepare them for failure from my very first meeting with them. 'I will never be satisfied,' that is how I would open the intimidation speech that brought them into my life. It was also a means of filtering. Those who fled for their lives weren't worth the effort anyway. Unfortunately, those who stayed weren't always worth the whole ordeal either. Datner was actually fine. But not starting antibiotics during the night? What is wrong with him?! I explicitly taught him, always love the patient. Always look for what can be done to improve their condition. Even slightly. No matter how irritating his mother is. Especially if his mother is irritating and hysterical. They are always right.

I wondered what possibilities he considered when he decided not to treat with antibiotics. Obviously, he didn't think of sepsis. Maybe he thought the deterioration was purely respiratory? Or neurological? What an odd decision. It looks like laziness. At least he performed the differential diagnosis of the Gram-positive bacteria well. I wonder if he sat and prepared for my arrival, reading again from the textbook that is completely abandoned during residency. Of course, he did.

I expected nothing from Dr. Katya. She always seemed to me like a useless ornamental foliage. Another background figure in the avant-garde post-modern painting called 'Sharona'.

But Dr. Renana, despite her constant depression, should have started Vancomycin. That woman doesn't think straight. Foggy brain, like a second-year student on a third exam attempt. A special session for special people.

The poor medical charting in the NICU was no surprise at all. It hadn't changed since I was a resident there. A good place to sleep at night, unless triplets were born at 26 weeks. Then a sleepless white night is in store for you. The meaning of the expression 'white night' is, of course, black night'.

I was sure I would hear more about the case being managed with such meticulousness that no mistake was missed. I regretted discovering very quickly that I was right.

\*\*\*

# Chapter 3 - The Traffic Jams at the Hospital Entrance

The traffic jams at the hospital entrance did not suit Professor Magen Ra'anan. The Acting Director of 'Sharona' Hospital found it intolerable that someone of his stature should wait in traffic with common mortals. He almost considered honking but stopped himself. Who knows, perhaps there was a resident stuck in the entrance traffic jam. Even the guard, who recognized him from afar, a hundred meters off, knew him and could tell his friends about it. Unpleasant.

Professor Magen Ra'anan, whom no one ever called Magen, and no one remembered what he specialized in (Nephrology), finally arrived at the parking lot. He recalled how much he despised the other members of management, his management, technically. Well, technically, he was only the Acting Director. But he had been the Acting Director for many years. In practice, he was the Director. Obviously. The doctors' parking lot was full of visitors' cars. There were always visitors. Thousands of visitors. None of them had ever learned how to park. Handbrake.

Professor Ra'anan had a mustache. Since forever, always a mustache, ever since his Bar Mitzvah. Initially, it was a boy's fuzz. A thin, light down. Embarrassing in its prematurity. He didn't shave it until his enlistment and had gotten used to the look. Subsequently, for years he had a 'broom' mustache. Like a generic tough British sergeant in recruitment posters. But when he became the Acting Director, he trimmed the mustache slightly to look more respectable. Something in the style of a 19th-century Viennese intellectual. The mustache served, therefore, as a constant disguise. Occasionally changing in character, but perpetually on his face. A mark of Cain.

Ra'anan got out of the car, struggling to step on his right foot, a memory of a car accident he had as a child. He had always refused to use a cane. He would not look like a disabled person. Ra'anan made sure, as was his habit, to check all the doors and wheels, attempting to see if anyone had recently vandalized his car. He would perform this check every time he entered or exited the car. Like a paranoid investor awaiting catastrophe. He would always find a new scratch on the corner of the door, or a key mark etched below the window. It seemed that the entire world aimed only to harm him and his new car. Always a new car.

Phone. A strange sound, Jamaican sounding. 'Oh, baby, I love your way, every day.' The ringtone and the gloomy phone owner were in a relationship that could only be described as cognitive dissonance.

""Hello? Hello? Who is it? I can't hear anything,"" Magen shrieked, almost automatically, without verifying that he was actually having trouble hearing his interlocutor. ""NICU? From the spokesperson's office? Alright, alright, a few minutes, I'm already in the parking lot, I'll arrive when I arrive."" Disconnection. He had a heavy Argentinian accent. The word 'Spokesperson's' sounded more like Spokesperrrrson's.

'Damn it,' he muttered, fully aware that he was the only witness to his display of frustration. He would have to visit the NICU and speak with the spokesperson. Too much trouble.

He preferred to do what he had done for the last thirty years. Idling in front of the computer. He would organize the articles on the news sites by interest. Every site had its own arrangement. Politics next to sports, gossip next to cooking. 'It passes the long hours of morning rounds nicely,' he often thought to himself. Not that he remembered what rounds looked like. Every time he volunteered to do one in recent years, he would find himself bored in the very first room. Worse, he didn't know what the residents were talking about or what they wanted from his life. Their questions were boring, stupid, or ones he didn't know the answer to. The latter kind was stressful. He skipped more and more of the little he did. Better to focus on mock meetings and organizing web articles. It was more respectable and suited his status.

To the NICU. He would certainly impress them, those cowards. All the doctors there were professional sycophants, especially the hysterical Dr. Katya and her even more hysterical Director. He liked that unit, a collection of chickens. But first, to his room on the second floor. A short tour of the wards before the day began. It conveyed an impression of professionalism and attention to every detail. Very important, he reflected, very important.

\*\*\*

The tour of the various wards was quick and uninteresting. Even in Ward C of Pediatrics, there was nothing interesting. An unfamiliar resident on call (whom Ra'anan thought might be a family medicine resident but was actually a confused intern who had agreed to be on call that night, despite the objections of the ward attending). In Ward F of Pediatrics, however, he saw an interesting chart on the desk. ""Bar'el."" That's quite a name from the past. Where did they pull him from?! Bar'el was a doctor who used to work for him, long ago. Until about 11 years ago. Or maybe 22 years. It wasn't clear. Probably 15 years, or some similarly asymmetrical number.

Ra'anan hated Bar'el. The filthy loser, who ran off to America and took Ilana and everything with him.

It must be a different Bar'el, and he’s just getting annoyed for nothing. What are the chances? He dismissed the thought.

He didn't notice that he forgot to visit the last ward, jumped on his way to the NICU via the Emergency Room, and disappeared behind the elevator next to the big green dumpster.

To the NICU!

\*\*\*

""What do you mean the journalist Sigal Segal wants to talk to me?"" Professor Ra'anan exclaimed, ""What do I have to do with her?"" he added. His mustache prickled, as if it were a barometer predicting changes in air pressure. The mustache informed Ra'anan that the pressure gauge had risen.

""She said you'd remember her from the previous Listeria outbreak in the NICU,"" answered Sarah Shabbat, the head nurse of the Pediatric Division, as she tried to hide behind the spokesperson's shoulders.

This answer struck Ra'anan in the gut. He was not prepared for this painful reminder. So many years had passed, but the mere mention of the topic caused him considerable abdominal discomfort. He would have to make an excuse and go to the bathroom in the next few minutes. This pressure would have to be released - from above or below. How, for God's sake, did Segal find out about a new Listeria growth in the NICU? The lab released the result less than three hours ago. Someone is 'singing' to her, Ra'anan decided.

In any case, the need to maintain composure and a dignified façade caused him to reply dryly: ""I will handle it.""

He would have preferred to have his teeth pulled without anesthesia, or to participate in Russian roulette with five bullets and one empty chamber. Still a non-negligible chance of survival. Professor Ra'anan didn't know how to calculate that chance. It was an 83% chance of death. Still better on the scale of horror compared to certain death in a conversation with a nosy journalist.

Meanwhile, he swallowed some saliva and half-shrieked, half-called out in a voice that tried to sound authoritative but came out sounding like a distress signal, ""Has anyone seen Dr. [Renana]()?""

# Prologue: Professor B.S.

Professor B.S. suffered from eternal insomnia. He sat before his television screen, far too alert.

**3:21.**

An interesting hour. Even more so when read in reverse. A basketball game murmured in the background, entirely irrelevant.

B.S. was contemplating the critical ethics of eating during a lecture. Not the students eating; that was perfectly legitimate in his eyes. He was thinking about the lecturer eating, mid-presentation. Nothing heavy, like beef and potatoes. Something light. A pleasant little salad. Perhaps a can of something carbonated on the side. But the students might take offense. The pretentious ones would likely file a complaint with the faculty.

*Ridiculous. It’s for their own benefit,* B.S. mused.

It would allow him to survive the mid-lecture hypoglycemia and bring the entire performance to a crescendo.

Perhaps he could bring in a patient while he was at it. Well, at least an actor. He could demonstrate meningeal signs on them - bend the neck until they screamed their soul out in pain.

Unpleasant.

Meningitis is undeniably unpleasant. Fortunately, only the actor must suffer.

Professor B.S. considered breaking his routine tomorrow to perform a ward round. A 'Peacock Walk,' just to remind everyone he was still among the living. Perhaps he would bark at someone regarding a botched chest X-ray interpretation, or, more amusingly, offer a rare word of praise to the department’s most incompetent resident. It was always good for a laugh.

The mere thought caused a twitch in his left flank. Or his right. Or both. Dealing with the actual practice of medicine was a dangerous business. Too demanding. Better to stick to lectures and remain entombed in his office. The air conditioning was sublime this time of year. Airy weather.

It was already four in the morning. Not good; sleep was no longer an option. Better to get dressed and brew some coffee. The morning would arrive soon enough.

\*\*\*

# Chapter 1 – Beep. Beep. Beep.

**Beep. Beep. Beep.**

White noise.

**Beep. Beep. Beep.**

White noise.

Dr. Eran Datner, the miserable resident on duty in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at 'Sharona' Hospital, glanced at his watch. 3:23. A digital watch. A toy for the new generation. He disliked the time staring back at him, something too symmetrical about it. Either too early to get up or far too late.

In any case, he wondered why he had woken up. The background drone of the monitors was a poor excuse. It was barely audible from behind the on-call room door in the NICU. It must be something else.

**Ring. Ring. Ring.**

The phone. The nurse Susan. Susan Schell.

That never meant anything good.

That American only spoke up to rant about vaccines or bark about resuscitation.

**Resuscitation**.

He leapt out of bed, nearly forgetting to put on his shoes, and bolted from the room. His thinning hair was disheveled, and he was wholly dazed and bewildered. He did not know what awaited him.

\*\*\*

Datner nearly stumbled over the nurses' desk before truly opening his eyes. He felt sour. Like a lemon squeezed into a margarita that had sat in the sun for far too long.

He knew what he had to do.

Too late.

Washing his face now would make the nurses look at him strangely. Combing his hair was out of the question; he had never owned a comb (he knew he did not have much to comb anyway). It was time for action.

Room 11.

The resuscitation in Room 11.

Susan had said it explicitly, that unhinged American from hell.

*Too harsh. Just an unhinged American, then. Still tough, though. American, the harshest curse of all.*

**Resuscitation**.

He pulled back the curtain of Room 11.

\*\*\*

A large incubator. Transparent. Horribly generic.

The baby was unmistakably **blue**.

It had a name, but no one cared about that at this stage. At this stage, it wasn't even clear what the baby’s sex was. A few things were clear to Datner now. The monitor above the incubator showed a low oxygen saturation of 76%, and the baby looked distinctly blue.

The pulse and blood pressure were not being read by the monitor, and there were too many nurses around the small incubator. At least three nurses. At least one of them was Susan Schell. That couldn't be good.

Worst of all, the incubator had not yet been opened. That really annoyed him.

He pushed his way past the flustered nurses, opened the incubator, and shouted at Susan - ""The Ambu, now."" He began ventilating. '*Not too hard,*' he recalled the advice of his old mentor, Prof. B.S., '*Gently, so you don’t burst the baby’s lungs.*'

The lungs, surprisingly, did not resist at all. The air pushed by the Ambu flowed easily into the small body, which gradually turned pinker and pinker.

""What are the blood pressure and pulse?"" Datner called out into the air, stifling a small smile at the saturation rising to 99%. *Even better than 100, better symmetry*. The sound the monitor emitted became much more tolerable. Almost melodic. Harmonic. *The Beach Boys* at their peak. *God Only Knows*.

""Still not reading,"" a voice from outer space replied.

That alien irritated Datner.

""Bring me a tube, size 2.5. And a laryngoscope with a small blade,"" he practically grumbled, disappointed by the slow flow of the event.

He did not fail to notice that Susan was working flawlessly. With all her faults, she was still quite experienced. She handed him the laryngoscope and the tube.

He put down the Ambu and inserted the laryngoscope.

'*Straight up at a right angle. With the patient’s eyes facing the ceiling,*' he recalled another piece of advice from Prof. B.S. Advice for all time. A Man for all seasons.

He wondered where B.S. was now.

Probably sitting at home watching TV and getting annoyed about his low salary. Who watches TV at this hour? Is the man a psychopath?!

Never mind. Moving on.

The vocal cords were clearly visible. A piece of cake. He inserted the tube quickly. Now, fixation.

This was the part he hated. He always felt the nurses would cause him to pull out the tube at that moment. Susan, however, didn't panic. ""At 9.5 centimeters, Doctor?"" she asked, almost affectionately.

""Yes,"" he mumbled, slightly surprised by her positive approach. He connected the Ambu to the tube and squeezed gently, compressing the small bellows only slightly, so as not to burst the lungs.

Meanwhile, the pulse returned. Approximately.

The monitor showed something that looked approximately like an ECG tracing in Lead 2. Not quite.

*The stickers! They had fallen off the baby’s chest. Nurse Miri was attaching them now. Other than that, she was useless. She should learn from Susan.*

Pulse 150. A small smile.

""And blood pressure?"" Datner almost whispered.

""Wait, I'm changing the cuff, the previous one is too big,"" Susan answered. He *almost* began to like her. Not really, but still, a little, given the situation and the alternatives. Better unhinged and efficient than sane and harmful.

Another half a minute passed. Thirty seconds is a long time when you are waiting. He began to remember how tired he was. A big yawn. Overt. For everyone to see. The questionable scent of his breath forced him to stop the show. If you eat something after midnight, it’s best not to have it spicy or with a lot of garlic. Crucially, it's best not to have **both** ingredients, Datner noted. Failed note.

Meanwhile, the tube fixation was finished, and he turned to adjust the parameters on the ventilator. He never quite understood how to choose the numbers, the ventilation metrics. Strange names for pressures – ‘PIP’, ‘PEEP’, and all sorts of other 'peeps' ran through his head. He also had pressure in his bladder. A sudden need to urinate. Fortunately, he sorted that out relatively easily here. Almost a coincidence. Dumb luck.

""Blood pressure 60/30,"" Susan cried, almost shouted, in a tone of joy, into the space.

It won't get better than that, Datner decided.

He barely knew what to do with himself now that he was no longer holding the tube or calibrating the ventilator. Nurse Miri smiled. Like a calf that had been given excellent straw.

Nurse Susan was frowning. Despite her advanced age, something of the Southern American beauty in which she had once excelled remained. *The Texas beauty queen forty years ago, no doubt*. He didn't recall her being originally from New York.

""What about Dextro?"" Datner barked.

""Immediately, Doctor,"" Susan replied submissively. She clearly had excellent training and manners that were out of this world. Foreign to the place.

He almost decided to go out to the stairwell and steal a few puffs of a cigarette.

Maybe it is better to update the on-call physician first.

But first, read the chart, he concluded.

He knew nothing about the infant who had just returned to life and certainly didn't know why this delicate creature had nearly collapsed completely. The on-call physician would not like a call about resuscitation without concrete information about the patient. He wasn't even sure if it was a male. He thought he saw testes during the ventilation, but he wasn't prepared to swear to it.

Still, a cigarette first. The on-call physician was certainly asleep now, and there was no reason to rush and call her before everything was known.

The watch showed 3:53. Still too symmetrical.

\*\*\*

""What do you mean, the baby in Room 11 almost died?"" the voice on the other end gasped. Datner wasn't sure if Dr. Katya Pavlichuk, the on-call neonatologist, was shouting or talking in her sleep. Maybe it was a combination of both? And what difference did it make anyway?

""He was perfectly fine this morning when I left him,"" the on-call physician continued, starting to wake up, grumbling about the uninvited wake-up call and the news it brought.

Datner glanced at his watch, 5:15, still symmetrical.

He thought that if he waited long enough, the on-call physician would appreciate the extra sleep time he had allowed her, and it would slightly dull the criticism of his ignorance regarding the chart.

He had tried earlier to read a little in the record, but everything was written in a particularly sloppy handwriting, worse even than his own, and most days there wasn't even a visit note. Only nurses’ comments alongside growth metrics and medication logs.

He gathered it was an infant (it was, after all, a male, those indeed were testes), a **29-week preemie** who had been in the NICU for two weeks, receiving some **TPN** (total parenteral nutrition; nutrition through the vein. The 'T' standing for Total - meaning exclusive IV nutrition, although the baby had already started receiving some formula).

And that was it.

Most of the time, the baby had been idling and lying in the incubator between visits, however many of those were conducted.

This was exactly what the on-call physician, Dr. Katya Pavlichuk, was lecturing him about now.

Datner wasn't really listening. He knew the ways of senior neonatologists. She would dump everything at him, regardless. Better to keep quiet and scowl. Healthier for his coronaries.

After a few more seconds (about two hundred, in Datner's estimation, who had begun to develop a slight, involuntary twitch) of a lecture on the essence of life and the fact that the baby had been perfect that morning when she left, Dr. Katya finally got around to asking something. It sounded like a question. Datner wasn't really listening.

Hello, hello, Datner, are you there?!"" Katya shrieked.

""Yes, certainly,"" Datner replied.

He was entertaining thoughts of early retirement. Considering his age (33, well-balanced), his professional status (a pediatric resident in his third out of four years), and his family status (unhappily married with two daughters who were probably very nice, he didn't really know them), these were premature, idle thoughts.

""How is the baby now? Is he ventilated? Does he need inotropes? Did you take cultures? Did you replace the central line? Did you start antibiotics?""

This was roughly what Dr. Katya rattled off. Datner wasn't really sure he cared.

""The baby is fine, easily ventilated, no inotropes, and no antibiotics,"" he replied, trying to avoid revealing the fact that he had failed to insert a central line and hadn't managed to take more than one blood culture. As for urine and cerebrospinal fluid cultures, forget about it. Let the morning shift do that. They rested all night.

He didn't tell Dr. Katya all of that, of course. She hadn't asked specifically. A small, harmless white lie, in Datner's opinion. She said she would arrive in about two hours (funny, that was the usual time for the morning meeting anyway) and that until then, he should update her if there was anything new. Anything at all.

""Yes, of course,"" Datner answered in an authoritative tone, his thoughts were far less polite.

\*\*\*

Dr. Katya Pavlichuk thought life was once more beautiful. When she was a child, still in Moscow, she dreamed of becoming a doctor. A pediatrician. She had always been the best student in school, the best student in medical school. Until she arrived in Israel. Straight to 'Sharona'.

When she arrived in the country, they told her 'Sharona' Hospital was in the Sharon region, as the name suggests. 'Two minutes from Tel Aviv,' they said. That was a crude lie; the drive was at least thirty minutes from Tel Aviv, and that was only if you drove at night, with zero traffic. No less. It wasn't really in the Sharon either; it was more in the Coastal Plain. She wasn't sure, and anyway, there was no one to complain to. But that’s where they assigned her, and she, being the good girl she was, did as she was instructed.

That was over twenty years ago already. Like another lifetime.

She tried to feel like she belonged from the start, but they didn't exactly make it easy.

For the first time in her life, she wasn't the popular success. She would hear them mocking her strange accent behind her back. Funny, in her eyes, the Israelis at 'Sharona' had the diction of Orientals. Mongolians. Descendants of Genghis Khan. Almost Mongoloid, she thought, a word she knew she shouldn’t be using. She remembered someone once told her that Dr. Down was a vicious, consummate racist. He was the one who gave the name 'Mongoloid' to babies with three sets of chromosomes 21 and slanted eyes. A smart fellow. A great racist, like all puffed-up Brits, but smart. He probably had crooked teeth. All smart Brits had crooked teeth. Even the not-so-smart ones. And they were all racists.

Only Dr. Renana treated her nicely, back then, when she first arrived at 'Sharona'. They became better friends. Renana was still sometimes happy then. Until that incident.

Now, as a veteran, Katya had learned to live in 'Sharona'. She no longer tried to excel. Excellence at 'Sharona' meant a death blow. A sign on your back. A mark of Cain.

She got out of bed and walked toward the bathroom. That Datner, she thought to herself. Couldn't he have waited another hour before telling her about a deteriorating baby?!

And why was the baby deteriorating anyway? He was perfectly fine this morning.

She would blame Datner for everything at the morning meeting. That was good for his character development.

The urine flowed relatively easily. In all cases. For Katya, Datner, and the temporarily stabilized preemie.

Relief.

Dr. Katya did not remember to check why the deteriorating baby was not given antibiotic treatment without reason, or what work-up was done to identify the possible infection. It was as if, in the heat of the events, she missed Datner's answer. Too bad; distraction was uncharacteristic of her.

\*\*\*

# Chapter 2  -  A Collection of Amateurs

""A collection of amateurs,"" I snapped. ""Just a bunch of amateurs. Not a single one of them belongs in a professional organization.""

The phone rang. It always rings in the bathroom, and always while I’m reading an article about the only soccer team I care about, FC ‘Sharona Sharks.’ A team with no luck; a fan with no luck.

I didn't know who was on the line. I’d replaced too many phones in recent years, and when one of the backups crashed, I just stopped trying to sync contacts. My call log was a graveyard of digits. Most names no longer appeared identified, just numbers, like Holocaust survivors. Those who merited a name, everyone deserves one, after all, were usually labeled as ""Blocked,"" ""Do Not Answer,"" ""Do Not Answer 3,"" or the more recent ""Blocked, Do Not Answer Forever. New.""

It was Datner. A pleasant enough fellow. I'd known him since he was a young, enthusiastic student. He was a good man, back during his internship. Pediatric residency hadn't done him any favors. His fair hair had receded and turned a premature gray, and his zest for life had almost completely evaporated. He was no longer light-hearted. I’d even known him while he was mourning his mother, and even then, he was more optimistic than he was now.

""Datner, I'm not a consultant for the NICU. Take your madness elsewhere. I had intended to spend the day in glorious, uninterrupted indolence,"" I shot back before he could even draw breath. Better to set the record straight before the request to claim my soul arrived.

He didn't stop. He was always stubborn. He apologized at length, babbling something incoherent about having been on duty in the NICU three days ago. Now, there were two isolates in a baby’s blood culture. The infectious disease specialist had dismissed it as contamination, but Datner feared it was real. He was truly sorry, he said, but maybe I could take a look?

It sounded like typical nonsense. I told him so. He insisted I come. Even just for five minutes.

I insisted I felt like hell. That was true; I hadn't felt well since the late 1980s. It didn't help. He insisted. The boy was relentless. I told him to shut up and let me drink my coffee, and that I’d be there in fifteen minutes.

""Promise?"" he asked. ""A sailor's promise, diseased with syphilis,"" I replied.

He hung up. Slow to take a hint, that one. But a good guy.

\*\*\*

A few minutes later, I was already nodding my head towards several familiar faces from the past. A gaggle of nurses who I had no idea were still alive. I didn't know any of their names, of course. Except for one, *Susan Schell*, who stood at the edge of the ward, near the kitchenette. ""Is she still alive?"" I wondered internally (or perhaps I shouted it, I'm not sure). She hadn't changed much at all. Maybe a wrinkle here, a white hair there, but still the beautiful Susan. An American from hell.

I adopted what I call my 'Dreamy Genius' expression, the one that says 'don't interrupt my profound thoughts' and strode briskly toward the place of the incubator in question, ignoring the astonished gazes of all the occupants. Datner was already standing there, beside the incubator containing a small body and many tubes.

""The little guy doesn't look good, friend,"" I opened with an immediate taunt.

""Aging fast,"" the impertinent student replied.

""You were somewhat economical with the truth regarding the patient’s status,"" I bristled.

""It happened recently, just this morning,"" Datner tried to defend himself.

A weak, apologetic response. Total surrender.

At this point, I grew tired of the intellectual chess game. More accurately, the easy victory prevented me from feeling any sense of satisfaction, so I decided to get to the point. This way, I would at least significantly cut down on my stay in the NICU, a unit I hadn't tolerated, along with its people, for over sixteen years. I glanced at the patient's chart and even managed to read a few lines before returning to torment Datner. It’s important to arrive prepared for battle; otherwise, there is a danger that the opponent might have a fair chance of success, heaven forbid.

I remember being a young student, not even a resident, when I heard people speaking respectfully about me behind my back. Rumors were circulated about the new genius on the ward, who knew everything during rounds, even before the attending physician. I will reveal the secret of the aforementioned magic to you, even though a proper magician never reveals his secrets. The whole secret lies in arriving half an hour before everyone else, opening all the charts of the new admissions from the night, and memorizing the admission details. Especially numbers of vital signs and selected lab indices. That's it. That’s the whole secret. A little memorization and spurting out the numbers before everyone finishes their coffee, and the title 'genius' is thrown your way without a problem. The art of illusion. The art of the lie.

""So, I see we have a small preemie, ventilated on inotropes, with a borderline pulse and unstable blood pressure, oxygenating with difficulty, and prone to ending his visit on planet Earth. And you say the little prince wasn't like this until your shift?"" I fired quickly. That's always my method. Stun them before they regain their composure.

If the fight is fair, there's a good chance you'll lose. After all, I was in enemy territory.

Datner was about to open his mouth when Dr. Katya appeared behind him.

\*\*\*

""Exactly, Prof. B.S., exactly. Simply appalling. Seventy-two hours ago, this was a completely healthy baby. And now? What a disaster,"" she almost sobbed. *Since when did she get so worked up? I remembered her as a cold fish, not spicy fish stew.*

""How are you, dear Dr. Katya?"" I mustered my most empathetic tone. I remember not tolerating her 20 years ago, when she first arrived at 'Sharona'. She was already a senior, and I was just a young, clueless resident. This whole meeting felt strange and unwelcome to me.

She didn't answer. She considered making a stinging comment but knew I'd fire back immediately. She gave up. Instead, Datner launched into a speech about cultures. I wasn't listening. There was a medical chart next to the incubator, and I picked it up and saw the problem immediately. I silenced Datner with a finger, and immediately burst forth with the following sentence:

""Gram-positive cocci in chains and Gram-positive bacilli. In the same culture. From the same time. Strange. Definitely strange.""

\*\*\*

""What do you say, Datner? Can you explain to Dr. Pavlichuk and me the possibilities in the differential diagnosis?""

Datner puffed out his chest. It was clear he had prepared for this. He launched into a monologue so long it felt like movie exposition.

""Three big possibilities. All of them are quite strange. First, contamination. The two growths are meaningless. This doesn't explain the child's condition, but it eliminates the need to understand the strange culture result."" I smiled; there was an echo of my own words from the past in his reply, it was clear the youth enjoyed quoting me. He continued:

""The second possibility is that only one bacterium is real, and the other is a contaminant. In that case, we need to analyze each possibility regarding each bacterium.""

""And the third possibility?"" I decided to intervene, even though it was completely unnecessary.

""Both bacteria represent real infections, which are not necessarily related, and may not even have been acquired in the same way, but both led to the child's deterioration."" The defense rested.

""I feel almost superfluous here, Datner and Katya. It's clear you've considered all the options. I'm sure you've already discussed the possible identity of the bacteria,"" I said, injecting a hint of mild insult into my words.

""Of course,"" Katya shrieked.

That woman needs sedatives; I decreed to myself. I nearly had a heart attack because of her sudden franticness.

""And?"" I pressed.

""Datner, tell him,"" Katya said, with a semblance of quasi-authoritativeness.

It was clear to me that she was afraid of making a mistake, and even more than that, trembling with fear at the possibility that I would correct her.

""The Streptococci are probably **GBS**,"" Datner began lecturing, ""That's the most common cause of neonatal sepsis, even this late.""

""And...?"" I continued to press.

""It could also be *Enterococcus*, though you taught me that without risk factors, it almost never does anything,"" chirped the visibly unshaven student. This didn't bother me; I had made a point of not arriving clean-shaven at work for over twenty years. I always replied to supervisors' questions about my poor shaving capabilities with the same answer: ""When I have time to sleep, I'll shave and maybe even shower."" I liked Datner's answer, even though he didn't list every possibility in the world. I decided to let it go and not press the point right now. This was uncharacteristic of me.

""And the second bacterium, Datner?"" I continued.

""The second is contamination or *Listeria*,"" he answered.

""Excellent,"" I smiled, ""And what about that entire list of Gram-positive bacilli I taught you a million times? Won't you repeat it for me?"" I purred sweetly.

""*Sure. Listeria*, Diphtheroids including *Diphtheria*, *Actinomyces*, *Nocardia*, *Clostridium*, and something else I forgot,"" Datner rattled off. I must have taught him that at least two hundred times. Or perhaps I'm exaggerating, and it was only six times.

""You forgot *Bacillus*, *Anthrax*, and *Cereus*,"" I fired back conspicuously. After all, I had to make it clear there was only one lion in the room.

""Well, I see you're managing fine without me. What treatment are you giving?"" I began moving toward the exit, carefully projecting indifference.

""Ampicillin, Gentamicin, and Claforan,"" Katya replied. ""To cover all the bases. Dr. Rina Renana advised it - it was started with the first consultation, the morning after the collapse,"" she added, almost apologetically.

She probably thought I would lash out if she left something out. A disgusting thought. I do not believe in violence. I only believe in death and the suffering preceding it. Everything else is debatable.

""Of course, excellent treatment,"" I replied with conspicuous mockery (It's strange they aren't giving empirical *Vancomycin* for a line infection and Gram-positive bacteria, I thought dismissively. That was quite shocking, to be honest) and decided to walk straight toward the exit door. One last fleeting glance at the incubator made it clear to me that this wouldn't end here. This baby wouldn't survive much longer.

I glanced at Dr. Katya's shoes. A ridiculous shade of red. The number **66** on the sneaker. Sixes mirroring each other. Like the word **SOS.** **DAD. MOM. TUT.** Funny. **LOL**.

""Update me on everything, and think about **Vanco**' - it's recommended,"" I shouted on my way out. I knew there was no chance of coming back to this hole.

\*\*\*

In bed at night, I struggled to fall asleep.

When I have trouble sleeping, I count other people’s medical errors. Never my own.

Datner disappointed me. I knew he would disappoint me. He isn't the first of my students to do so. I learned to prepare them for failure from my very first meeting with them. 'I will never be satisfied,' that is how I would open the intimidation speech that brought them into my life. It was also a means of filtering. Those who fled for their lives weren't worth the effort anyway. Unfortunately, those who stayed weren't always worth the whole ordeal either. Datner was actually fine. But *not* starting antibiotics during the night? What is wrong with him?! I explicitly taught him, always love the patient. Always look for what can be done to improve their condition. Even slightly. No matter how irritating his mother is. Especially if his mother is irritating and hysterical. They are always right.

I wondered what possibilities he considered when he decided not to treat with antibiotics. Obviously, he didn't think of sepsis. Maybe he thought the deterioration was purely respiratory? Or neurological? What an odd decision. It looks like laziness. At least he performed the differential diagnosis of the Gram-positive bacteria well. I wonder if he sat and prepared for my arrival, reading again from the textbook that is completely abandoned during residency. Of course, he did.

I expected nothing from Dr. Katya. She always seemed to me like a useless ornamental foliage. Another background figure in the avant-garde post-modern painting called 'Sharona'.

But Dr. Renana, despite her constant depression, should have started Vancomycin. That woman doesn't think straight. Foggy brain, like a second-year student on a third exam attempt. A special session for special people.

The poor medical charting in the NICU was no surprise at all. It hadn't changed since I was a resident there. A good place to sleep at night, unless triplets were born at 26 weeks. Then a sleepless *white night* is in store for you. The meaning of the expression *'white* *night*' is, of course, *black night*'.

I was sure I would hear more about the case being managed with such meticulousness that no mistake was missed. I regretted discovering very quickly that I was right.

\*\*\*

# Chapter 3 - The Traffic Jams at the Hospital Entrance

The traffic jams at the hospital entrance did not suit Professor Magen Ra'anan. The Acting Director of 'Sharona' Hospital found it intolerable that someone of his stature should wait in traffic with common mortals. He almost considered honking but stopped himself. Who knows, perhaps there was a resident stuck in the entrance traffic jam. Even the guard, who recognized him from afar, a hundred meters off, knew him and could tell his friends about it. Unpleasant.

Professor Magen Ra'anan, whom no one ever called Magen, and no one remembered what he specialized in (Nephrology), finally arrived at the parking lot. He recalled how much he despised the other members of management, **his** management, technically. Well, technically, he was only the **Acting** Director. But he had been the Acting Director for many years. In practice, he was the Director. Obviously. The doctors' parking lot was full of visitors' cars. There were always visitors. Thousands of visitors. None of them had ever learned how to park. Handbrake.

Professor Ra'anan had a mustache. Since forever, always a mustache, ever since his Bar Mitzvah. Initially, it was a boy's fuzz. A thin, light down. Embarrassing in its prematurity. He didn't shave it until his enlistment and had gotten used to the look. Subsequently, for years he had a 'broom' mustache. Like a generic tough British sergeant in recruitment posters. But when he became the Acting Director, he trimmed the mustache slightly to look more respectable. Something in the style of a 19th-century Viennese intellectual. The mustache served, therefore, as a constant disguise. Occasionally changing in character, but perpetually on his face. A mark of Cain.

Ra'anan got out of the car, struggling to step on his right foot, a memory of a car accident he had as a child. He had always refused to use a cane. He would not look like a disabled person. Ra'anan made sure, as was his habit, to check all the doors and wheels, attempting to see if anyone had recently vandalized his car. He would perform this check every time he entered or exited the car. Like a paranoid investor awaiting catastrophe. He would always find a new scratch on the corner of the door, or a key mark etched below the window. It seemed that the entire world aimed only to harm him and his new car. Always a new car.

Phone. A strange sound, Jamaican sounding. '*Oh, baby, I love your way, every day*.' The ringtone and the gloomy phone owner were in a relationship that could only be described as cognitive dissonance.

""Hello? Hello? Who is it? I can't hear anything,"" Magen shrieked, almost automatically, without verifying that he was actually having trouble hearing his interlocutor. ""NICU? From the spokesperson's office? Alright, alright, a few minutes, I'm already in the parking lot, I'll arrive when I arrive."" Disconnection. He had a heavy Argentinian accent. The word 'Spokesperson's' sounded more like *Spokesperrrrson's*.

*'Damn it*,' he muttered, fully aware that he was the only witness to his display of frustration. He would have to visit the NICU and speak with the spokesperson. Too much trouble.

He preferred to do what he had done for the last thirty years. Idling in front of the computer. He would organize the articles on the news sites by interest. Every site had its own arrangement. Politics next to sports, gossip next to cooking. 'It passes the long hours of morning rounds nicely,' he often thought to himself. Not that he remembered what rounds looked like. Every time he volunteered to do one in recent years, he would find himself bored in the very first room. Worse, he didn't know what the residents were talking about or what they wanted from his life. Their questions were boring, stupid, or ones he didn't know the answer to. The latter kind was stressful. He skipped more and more of the little he did. Better to focus on mock meetings and organizing web articles. It was more respectable and suited his status.

To the NICU. He would certainly impress them, those cowards. All the doctors there were professional sycophants, especially the hysterical Dr. Katya and her even more hysterical Director. He liked that unit, a collection of chickens. But first, to his room on the second floor. A short tour of the wards before the day began. It conveyed an impression of professionalism and attention to every detail. Very important, he reflected, very important.

\*\*\*

The tour of the various wards was quick and uninteresting. Even in Ward C of Pediatrics, there was nothing interesting. An unfamiliar resident on call (whom Ra'anan thought might be a family medicine resident but was actually a confused intern who had agreed to be on call that night, despite the objections of the ward attending). In Ward F of Pediatrics, however, he saw an interesting chart on the desk. ""**Bar'el**."" That's quite a name from the past. Where did they pull him from?! Bar'el was a doctor who used to work for him, long ago. Until about 11 years ago. Or maybe 22 years. It wasn't clear. Probably 15 years, or some similarly asymmetrical number.

Ra'anan hated Bar'el. The filthy loser, who ran off to America and took Ilana and everything with him.

It must be a different Bar'el, and he’s just getting annoyed for nothing. What are the chances? He dismissed the thought.

He didn't notice that he forgot to visit the last ward, jumped on his way to the NICU via the Emergency Room, and disappeared behind the elevator next to the big green dumpster.

To the NICU!

\*\*\*

""What do you mean the journalist Sigal Segal wants to talk to me?"" Professor Ra'anan exclaimed, ""What do I have to do with her?"" he added. His mustache prickled, as if it were a barometer predicting changes in air pressure. The mustache informed Ra'anan that the pressure gauge had risen.

""She said you'd remember her from the previous Listeria outbreak in the NICU,"" answered Sarah Shabbat, the head nurse of the Pediatric Division, as she tried to hide behind the spokesperson's shoulders.

This answer struck Ra'anan in the gut. He was not prepared for this painful reminder. So many years had passed, but the mere mention of the topic caused him considerable abdominal discomfort. He would have to make an excuse and go to the bathroom in the next few minutes. This pressure would have to be released - from above or below. How, for God's sake, did Segal find out about a new *Listeria* growth in the NICU? The lab released the result less than three hours ago. Someone is 'singing' to her, Ra'anan decided.

In any case, the need to maintain composure and a dignified façade caused him to reply dryly: ""I will handle it.""

He would have preferred to have his teeth pulled without anesthesia, or to participate in Russian roulette with five bullets and one empty chamber. Still a non-negligible chance of survival. Professor Ra'anan didn't know how to calculate that chance. It was an 83% chance of death. Still better on the scale of horror compared to certain death in a conversation with a nosy journalist.

Meanwhile, he swallowed some saliva and half-shrieked, half-called out in a voice that tried to sound authoritative but came out sounding like a distress signal, ""Has anyone seen Dr. [Renana]()?""

\*\*\*

Dr. Renana sat in her room. She was crying. This was not unusual; she often cried. Especially in the early morning hours. Sometimes at noon, too. And she certainly cried in the evening, alone in the dark house, where the lights were almost never turned on. At least not since that outbreak. This morning, she discovered that the baby behind curtain eleven had *Listeria* sepsis. It didn't look like he would survive it. She didn't like the baby at all. He was a complete stranger. Just some mother's kid, the son of someone from the settlement Nevat. Maybe from Snora, definitely not from Chutor. That place was not suitable for the area's nobility. But the *Listeria* broke her. As if it emerged from the depths of the sea, like a mysterious mythical monster, only to suck a new victim into its depths.

The fact that *pneumococcus* also grew in the baby's blood did not escape her notice. But right now, she was not mentally available to deal with it. She would give proper consultation later. Probably just a lab mistake. Maybe someone is spitting on the plates for fun.

Right now she was crying. Although more quietly, and mostly what remained of the high drama was mucus. She would have to stop by the supermarket today and buy tissues. The expensive kind, soft on the nose. She wondered to herself if she was carrying *pneumococcus* in her nose. A non-negligible chance. And *Listeria*? What was the chance she was carrying *Listeria*? It couldn't be very high, but still, she had managed to eat sushi at least twice in the last year. Stupid thoughts, she noted. She returned to crying.

Beyond the door, she heard Ra'anan's voice. Shouting and more hysterical than ever. She didn't like him when he shouted, losing control. It seemed to happen to him more and more over the years. Histrionic. Funny, the word hysteria derives from *'hystera*,' the Greek word for womb, as if hysteria is reserved for ladies. He was definitely a histrionic type, Ra'anan. Everyone thought they were good friends, but that was a lie. They were good colleagues. Partners in interests and much more than that. Especially being at her apartment every Monday and Thursday. But she couldn't stand his personality. He was hysterical and frantic. It reminded her of herself, as she used to be.

Still, she remembered his kindness towards her years ago. When Bar'el tried to dismantle everything, when she was already broken. He, nevertheless, kept the place standing. What was taken from her, of course, he could not restore.

A knock on the door. It had to be Ra'anan. She blew her nose for the hundred and first time - a beautiful, symmetrical number - and approached the door. Ra'anan.

\*\*\*

Ra'anan entered the small room and closed the door behind him. He immediately noticed the tears that had smeared the makeup on Rina's face. At home, he would call her Renani. To her, it sounded like Rrrrrenani. She loved the Argentinian rolling 'R'. A feeling like a goal in the World Cup. No one knew that they had been together for the past few years. After each of them was cruelly abandoned, he by Ilana and she by Yaakov, they found each other mutually agreeable.

This was, of course, a lie they both perpetrated upon themselves. They didn't genuinely like each other. They found a comfortable niche to curl up in, within the void gaping in each of them. And perhaps that is precisely the definition of affection, even of love. Ultimate comfort. The ability to contain holes.

Ra'anan hugged Renana. She flinched. Lest someone enter through the door without knocking first, and discover everything. She did not know then that everyone had already been whispering the obvious for a long time.

2.5 months into Tyvense (Irish Vyvanse) titration, currently on 50mg, it helps my innatentive ADHD symptoms a lot (focus, energy, mood) but doesn't help hyperactivity and sometimes makes it worse - not a major issue because the focus was the main thing but I would like a calmer mind . Issue persistent across all doses. Not sure if it's normal, would like to hear if anyone else experienced this and if anything helped. 

----------------------------------
Main Post:


Hello, I'm a couple of months into titration for Tyvense (Irish Vyvanse name - I started on 20mg and recently moved to 50mg after increasing every couple of weeks) and I've noticed it does help a lot with my focus, motivation and general mood - it's a lot easier to get in the zone when working on something, or even with fun things like video games I can enjoy them without my mind wandering or getting bored. It helps a lot with the lethargy I felt before where nothing was holding my attention unless I was actively hyperfocusing, which was triggered randomly. It's like my mind went from feeling congested to open. 

However, it isn't helping with my hyperactive elements much - I still have a noisy brain, feel restless often, and fidget a lot or clack my teeth. Sometimes I feel more hyperactive than before - it can be a positive, productive energy where I want to run around and clean the house, or it can be more of a shaky, jittery feeling. I don't think it's as simple as the dose being too high though because I've experienced it with all doses, the higher doses do seem to help with focus more, and I have an issue of crashing too early which seems a bit better since upping to 50mg. 

I heard for some people they can add on other meds to help, like non-stimulant meds in conjunction with the stims, but I'm already on an SSRI so I'm nervous about combining so many psych meds. Not sure if it'll improve with time as I adjust to the meds more too, I'm finding titration to be a pretty intensive process.

Also to note, I am still having a small amount of caffeine in 1 weak coffee in the morning (I used to be a Monster addict so this is a huge cut for me), I know caffeine can be not ideal but on the days I tried not to take it, it made the Tyvense crash and jitteriness worse and I was a nervous wreck :( I will try cut it out completely once I'm fully settled with meds and get the crashes sorted. 

Did anyone else have a similar experience with stimulants? If so, did anything help? I kept hearing about people starting ADHD meds and experiencing a sudden quiet/calm but I haven't really gotten that. Maybe the first ever day I took it, where I got calm and really sleepy and took a nap for a couple of hours before getting a kind of high and energy burst from that initial stimulant euphoria and went on a cleaning rampage in the house lol.

# Upcoming Section 232 Trade Actions: What Importers Need to Know on January 20, 2026

Presidential Proclamations on Critical Minerals and Semiconductors Set to Reshape Key Supply Chains.

On January 20, 2026, two new Presidential Proclamations will be published in the Federal Register, each carrying significant implications for U.S. importers across manufacturing, electronics, automotive, aerospace, energy, and advanced technology industries. These actions follow extensive national security investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and target two categories central to U.S. economic and defense capabilities:

* Proclamation 11001 – *Processed Critical Minerals and Derivative Products; Adjustment*
* Proclamation 11002 – *Semiconductors, Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, and Derivative Products; Adjustment*

Below is a clear breakdown of what’s coming and how your business can prepare.

# Proclamation 11001: Processed Critical Minerals & Derivatives

**Why It Matters**

Critical minerals such as cobalt, nickel, rare earth elements, gallium, germanium, lithium, uranium, indium, yttrium, and others power nearly every modern industry — from defense systems and energy storage to electronics, fiber optic networks, medical technology, and vehicles.

**Commerce’s Section 232 investigation found that:**

* The U.S. is fully import dependent for 12 critical minerals and 50%+ reliant on 29 others.
* Even where the U.S. mines minerals domestically, it lacks sufficient processing capacity, creating a strategic vulnerability.
* These minerals and their derivative products are embedded throughout the 16 critical infrastructure sectors, including energy, communications, transportation, defense, chemicals, and manufacturing.

**What the Proclamation Does**

**The January 20th publication will:**

* Direct the U.S. Trade Representative and Department of Commerce to negotiate new or expanded agreements with partner countries to secure stable, diversified mineral supply chains.
* Establish a 180-day negotiation window.
* Enable the President to impose minimum import prices, tariffs, quotas, or other remedial actions if effective agreements are not reached.

**What Importers Should Expect**

* Potential new tariff lines or price floor mechanisms. • Increased scrutiny on origin, processing location, and supply chain mapping.
* Volatility in procurement costs for industries dependent on magnets, batteries, catalysts, alloys, and electronic components.

# Proclamation 11002: Semiconductors & Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment

**Why It Matters**

Semiconductors are foundational to national defense, critical infrastructure, artificial intelligence, communications, medical devices, and advanced manufacturing. The investigation determined that:

* The U.S. manufactures only \~10% of the chips it consumes.
* The country remains heavily reliant on foreign semiconductor fabrication, lithography equipment, and other SME tools.
* Strategic chips — including those supporting AI and secure communications — require stable and trustworthy supply chains.

Immediate Trade Impact: **25%**

Tariff Proclamation 11002 triggers:

* A 25% ad valorem tariff, already effective as of January 15, 2026, on specific advanced computing chips and derivative products if they do not contribute to building out the U.S. semiconductor supply chain.

**Key provisions:**

* No drawback allowed.
* Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) entries for covered chips must use privileged foreign status.
* Certain end-use exceptions exist for imports that directly support U.S. production capacity.

# What Comes Next

**Commerce outlined a two-phase approach:**

**Phase 1 (Immediate):**

Narrow, high-priority tariffs on sensitive AI-related or advanced semiconductor inputs.

**Phase 2 (Future):**

Broader tariffs or negotiated solutions, depending on international cooperation, paired with programs to encourage U.S. domestic semiconductor investment.

**What This Means for Your Business**

1. **Review Your HTS Classifications Immediately** \- Determine whether any imported materials, chips, wafers, substrates, or SME tooling appear in the forthcoming proclamation annexes.
2. P**repare for New Tariff Scenarios** \-  Both proclamations open the door to future tariff expansions — not just on raw materials, but on subcomponents, derivative products, and downstream assemblies.
3. **Strengthen Supplier Documentation & Origin Controls** \- Expect heightened compliance expectations from Customs and potential requests for detailed processing stage evidence.
4. **Watch for Additional Guidance After January 20** \- CBP is expected to issue CSMS notices, and Commerce/USTR may release FAQs, annex clarifications, and implementation instructions shortly after publication.

BEIJING – 

Chinese exports of rare earth magnets to Japan in December fell 8% from November, when a diplomatic spat left market participants concerned about future shipments — concern exacerbated by a ban Beijing imposed in January on the export of dual-use items to Japan.

Outbound shipments from the ‍world's largest producer of rare earth magnets to its Asian ‍neighbor totaled 280 metric tons last month versus the 2025 peak of 305 tons a month before, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Tuesday.



Still, the December volume ‍to Japan was 31.4% higher than in the same month in 2024.

The on-year surge was likely due to Japanese buyers ‌ramping up purchases in anticipation of further Chinese restrictions, analysts said. Shipments to Japan are likely to ‌drop in January due to the ban on ‌items that can have military applications.

The ban came two ‌months after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Japan would respond militarily should China attack Taiwan. The comment angered China, which claims sovereignty over the democratically ruled island — a claim Taiwan rejects.

The December data also showed exports of rare earth magnets to the U.S. fell 3% from a month earlier to 564 tons. For all of 2025, 5,933 ‍tons ‍were shipped to the U.S. — an annual fall of 20.3%.

Shipments to the U.S. recovered after China agreed ‍to pause some export controls following a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. counterpart Donald Trump.

Overall, rare earth magnet exports fell 3.2% in December from a month ‌earlier to 5,952 tons. The volume was the fourth-highest in 2025.

For all of 2025, China exported 57,392 tons of rare earth magnets, representing an annual decline of 1.3%.

# Jan. 20th, 2026~ Is Europe losing the race to secure rare earth materials?

[Is Europe losing the race to secure rare earth materials? | Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2026/01/20/is-europe-losing-the-race-to-secure-rare-earth-materials)

[Copyright AP Photo](https://preview.redd.it/3m4lj289iheg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=38f4cbd8ad9748fc9d602db4f45c0248f37f194c)

# US President Trump’s threat of additional tariffs to force the acquisition of Greenland highlights a persistent concern: Europe is lagging in the global competition for rare earths and critical minerals. Has it already lost the race?

On Tuesday morning, Donald Trump shared a digitally edited image of himself planting a US flag on Greenland, showing he is still interested in buying the island. Greenland has large reserves of valuable raw materials, which is why it attracts attention.

This raises a larger issue: Europe depends heavily on external suppliers for these resources, while the US, China, and Russia are using them to strengthen their positions. Europe’s reliance on imports is becoming a real problem.

China dominates most of the global rare earth supply chain, controlling about 60-70% of mining and up to 90% of processing capacity. In contrast, Europe has remained stagnant.

According to the European Commission’s latest data (2024), the EU currently imports 95% of its rare earth materials, which are crucial for electric vehicles, daily technology and defence systems. Recycling rates remain below 1%, and although the bloc has set a series of goals for 2030, it is unlikely to meet them without major acceleration.

This means that the very technologies meant to enable Europe’s green transition depend on other countries, leaving the EU highly exposed to economies such as China and Russia.

Whilst global competitors are tightening their grip on supply chains, Europe is lagging in securing access to rare earths.

Still, EU policymakers maintain that the situation is not irreversible. Despite starting from a weak position and being in the early stages of reform, the bloc aims to increase independence, achieve leadership, and deliver an efficient clean energy transition.

# What are rare earths, and why does everybody want them?

“Rare earth materials” are a group of 17 metallic elements (15 lanthanide elements, plus scandium and yttrium) with unique properties essential for clean energy and high-tech manufacturing.

As their name suggests, they are scarce, and their extraction and treatment are complex. Deposits only exist in a few locations worldwide, including Greenland, which has recently become the focus of geopolitical interest.

Rare earths have powerful magnetic, light-emitting, and chemically reactive properties. These characteristics make them critical for developing high-performance technologies across key sectors such as energy, electronics, and defence.

In clean energy and transport, rare-earth magnets are used in EVs to make them lighter, more powerful, and efficient. They also allow wind turbines to generate more energy from each rotation. High-efficiency generators, power electronics, and grid-balancing systems rely on rare-earth materials to help electricity networks handle growing levels of intermittent solar and wind power.

Beyond energy, they are key in lasers, photonics, fibre-optic networks, and semiconductor tools for data centres, telecom, and advanced computing.

The same high-performance magnets power industrial robots, CNC machines, and automated manufacturing equipment.

They also play a critical role in defence and aerospace, enabling radar, sonar, precision-guided munitions, jet engines, night-vision devices, satellites, and space-grade electronics that can withstand extreme environments.

And it’s not just about industrial use or geopolitics: rare earths are embedded in European’s everyday consumer products. Smartphones, laptops, headphones, speakers, and modern displays all rely on rare-earth phosphors, magnets, and polishing powders to deliver good sound quality, bright screens, compact designs, and long-lasting performance.

They are also vital in life-saving medical tools: they are used in MRI scanners and advanced medical imaging equipment, as well as for environmental tools like catalytic converters and industrial catalysts for pollution control and water treatment systems.

# Why is Europe losing the race for rare earths?

So, given their importance, why is Europe so behind? One reason is that the continent never built an integrated industrial chain. China, in contrast, started treating rare earths as a strategic sector decades ago and invested across every step of the value chain, from mining and separation to refining, metals, alloys, magnets, and downstream manufacturing.

Europe took a different path. Over time, it allowed early processing and magnet-making capacity to fade, failed to develop domestic refining capability, and became increasingly reliant on cheaper imports. As a result, the EU now depends on foreign suppliers for nearly every critical stage of production

Structural barriers within Europe have severely widened this gap. The EU currently has lengthy permitting procedures, fragmented regulations, and strong local opposition that slows or blocks mining and refining projects.

Environmental restrictions are stringent, raising costs and extending timelines. At the same time, public financing is scattered across multiple national programmes, while investment incentives have been weaker than in competitor regions.

These frictions discourage the private sector from building the large-scale facilities needed to compete on the global stage. The EU only started treating rare earths as a strategic priority after 2020. China began doing so in the 1980s.

It is therefore no surprise that China now dominates nearly all segments of the chain and has built integrated clusters where miners, refiners, alloy makers, magnet factories, and end-product manufacturers operate side by side.

State-owned companies coordinate production, financing, and research and development (R&D), creating powerful economies of scale. Long-term strategies, low-cost production, and a willingness to use export controls to steer global supply have further strengthened Beijing’s position.

It’s a degree of integration that makes it extremely hard for late movers like Europe to catch up, and leaves the EU instead almost entirely dependent on Beijing. Today, 98% of the EU's rare-earth magnets come from China, along with 85% of its supply of rare-earth elements. And it’s not just China; the EU is up against a group of economies such as the United States, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Canada, which have moved faster and more decisively.

The US is rapidly scaling mining, refining, and magnet production with large federal subsidies, tax credits, and guaranteed offtake agreements. Australia has strong upstream production and close partnerships with Japan and the US.

Japan, meanwhile, dedicated over a decade developing alternative supply routes after China's 2010 export restrictions and is now a global leader in magnet technology.



South Korea and Canada are also expanding aggressively, leveraging coordinated industrial policy and strong links to the US supply chain.

# What is the EU doing to advance in the race?

The EU is rolling out a combination of new laws, funding tools, trade policy, and international partnerships to secure rare earth supplies by 2030, reduce dependence on China, and maintain high environmental standards. The centrepiece of this strategy is the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), announced by Commission president Ursula von der Leyen in 2023 and now in force. Alongside it is the newer RESourceEU package, along with strategic projects, recycling efforts, and international supply deals, implemented in 2025.

The CRMA sets clear targets for 2030 targets. At least 10% of demand for strategic raw materials demand should be extracted within the bloc, 40% processed domestically, and 25% sourced from recycling. At the same time, imports from any single non-EU country are capped at 65%. These targets aim to boost resilience, promote domestic industries, and reduce the risks of over-dependence on third countries.

https://preview.redd.it/kja8bn1qiheg1.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1a22425573f013d47f53f3ec18dca160a3ffd9e

Under the CRMA framework, the Commission designates ""Strategic Projects"" across extraction, processing, magnet manufacturing, and recycling that receive priority permitting, a single administrative contact, and structured access to EU financing. This accelerates project timelines and improves access to funding and regulatory support.

In 2025, the Commission launched the RESourceEU initiative and Action Plan to close the gap between CRMA ambitions and on-the-ground projects, focusing on a few value chains, including rare earth elements and rare-earth magnets.

RESourceEU aims to mobilise about €3 billion for mature projects starting by 2029. By supporting projects such as Vulcan Energy’s lithium venture and Greenland Resources’ molybdenum mine, the policy hopes to catalyse private investment and demonstrate EU commitment, with similar support planned for rare-earth projects to speed their market entry. away from China

At the same time, the EU is negotiating and deepening strategic partnerships on critical raw materials with countries such as Canada, Chile, Kazakhstan, Namibia, and Ukraine to secure access to non-Chinese supplies of rare earths and related materials.

New trade and export-control tools are being developed, partly in response to China’s export restrictions on rare earths and magnet-making equipment. Measures such as joint purchasing and stockpiling are intended to strengthen supply security and help the EU better manage and anticipate supply disruptions.

Policy packages encourage recycling rare earths from wind turbines, EV motors, and electronics, supported by the CRMA’s 25% target and R&D funding. The goal is to reduce primary extraction demand, create a circular economy, and ensure the long-term sustainability of EU supply.

The EU is investing in research on substitution, such as motors with fewer or no rare earths, and more efficient magnet technologies to lower reliance on mined rare earths. This makes supply chains less vulnerable to external shocks over time.

For Strategic Projects, the CRMA has set indicative permitting timelines: about 27 months for extraction and 15 months for processing or recycling and coordinates financial and regulatory support through a Raw Materials Mechanism. These steps aim to minimize bureaucratic delays and improve project delivery speed without compromising oversight.

The European Commission has stressed that environmental directives and public participation rights remain in force, ensuring the push for rare earths aligns with EU nature protection, water, and climate laws. This approach aims to balance urgent supply needs with existing legal and environmental safeguards.

# What does the future hold for rare earths in Europe?

Demand for rare earths in Europe is expected to rise sharply in the coming decade. Even with expanded processing and recycling capacity, the EU is unlikely to achieve self-sufficiency by 2030 and will remain reliant on imports.

The future of rare earths in Europe will likely see rising demand, only partial self‑sufficiency by 2030, and continued reliance on imports even if EU mining, processing and recycling expand.

Policy is moving fast, but many experts, including members of the [European Parliament,](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2024/766253/EPRS%5FBRI%282024%29766253%5FEN.pdf) say Europe will struggle to meet its 2030 rare‑earth targets without a stronger push on projects and public support.

The EU wants to mine at least 10% of its key raw materials, including rare earths, in Europe by 2030. The rest should come from recycling and partners outside China.

Projects like LKAB in Sweden and more refining and magnet production could eventually supply about 20% of the EU’s rare earth demands by the end of the decade.

However, slow permits and local resistance mean much of this production will not arrive until the 2030s.

# Recycling and circular economy efforts will grow and supply more after 2030, but Europe will still need to import rare earths.

# 🚀 NioCorp: Q1–Q2 2026 Is the Convergence Window — From Validation leading to FID

By the end of 2025, NioCorp had quietly crossed a threshold many junior mining and critical minerals projects never reach: it exited the year with **execution pathways visible, aligned, and increasingly synchronized**. This is no longer a story about geological promise. It is now about **sequencing milestones toward Final Investment Decision (FID)**.

The **dual mine portal construction beginning in Q1 2026** marks the first irreversible physical step toward full mine development at Elk Creek. This isn’t symbolic — it establishes permanent underground access, supports geotechnical validation, enables construction sequencing, and signals to financiers and strategic partners that the project has moved beyond planning into build-mode reality. It’s the kind of milestone banks, government agencies, and industrial partners actually underwrite against.

The **January 12, 2026 full assay release** further reinforced the scale and consistency of the ore body, strengthening the foundation for the **updated DFS (Definitive Feasibility Study)** that management has repeatedly framed as transformative — not just refreshed. This DFS is expected to reflect modernized engineering, updated recovery assumptions, Railveyor™ integration, optimized capex sequencing, and a materially de-risked execution profile. In other words, a document designed for lenders, not retail.

Layered over this technical and construction progress is something even more powerful: **strategic validation from the U.S. defense ecosystem**. The Pentagon-funded scandium program, the $10M award, and the Lockheed Martin / Skunk Works involvement are not PR optics — they are structural signals. These relationships place Elk Creek within the **national industrial base conversation**, not just the commodities market.

This is where **February 2026’s anticipated “first metal” Scandium-Aluminum alloy milestone** becomes critical. As Alex Guthrie stated during the RedChip Q&A, this is expected to be the moment where lab-scale work transitions into tangible alloy output — the point at which NioCorp’s scandium stops being theoretical and becomes **deployable material for next-generation platforms**. When combined with the ecosystem of NAMA, Nanoscale, Creative Engineers, and the FEA IP acquisition, the implication is clear: this is evolving into a vertically integrated **defense materials platform**, not simply a mine.

Jim’s responses on **December 12, 2025** added another important layer. His tone was not promotional — it was deliberate. He emphasized sequencing, discipline, and alignment: financing must match execution readiness; milestones must support credibility; and the company is positioning Elk Creek so that when commitments are finalized, they are durable. The subtext was unmistakable: management is no longer asking whether the project advances, but **ensuring it advances correctly**. That distinction matters enormously to institutional capital.

Meanwhile, the macro environment continues to move in NioCorp’s direction. Elk Creek is positioned to become:

* The **only primary Niobium mine in the United States**
* A domestic source of **Scandium for advanced aerospace alloys**
* A producer of **Titanium and magnet REEs** aligned with defense, AI infrastructure, robotics, and energy transition supply chains

EXIM Bank’s potential **$780M financing package**, which management has indicated could reach decision windows in **Q2–Q3 2026**, now sits alongside advancing ESIA work, growing strategic visibility, and increasing probability of **offtakes, JV structures, or anchor partners** once the DFS and metallurgy milestones land.

**Put simply:**  
Q1–Q2 2026 is not about hype catalysts.  
It is about **convergence of construction, metallurgy, validation, financing, and strategic alignment**.

That is exactly the phase where projects stop being valued like speculation and start being valued like **infrastructure**.

**This is why EXIM, DoD, and Tier-1 primes are in deep discussions —** they need a fully domestic, fully integrated producer, and NioCorp is already architected to deliver exactly that.

***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.** The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

Covering phones, grabbing coffee, helping with reports, staying a bit late when someone ran behind. I didnt mind, it felt normal and we all help each other right?



One coworker in particular started leaning on me a lot. Lets call her S. It was always small stuff at first but it slowly turned into daily asks. Can you finish this email. Can you stay an extra hour. Can you swap lunch breaks. I started feeling drained but never said anything. Last month during a team lunch she joked that Im ""kind of cold and robotic"" and said it laughing, but everyone went quiet. I brushed it off but honestly it stuck with me more than I expected.



After that I stopped volunteering. I still do my job well, still polite, still helpful when its truly needed. I just dont jump in automatically anymore. I say sorry I cant today. Or Im busy right now. Since then S barely talks to me and another coworker hinted that I was being passive aggressive and holding a grudge.



I dont think Im punishing anyone, I just adjusted my energy. But part of me wonders if this is immature and I should have said something directly instead of pulling back quietly.

I dont mind lending a charger or a pen but Ive always felt weird about headphones.



A coworker started using them occasionally when I wasnt at my desk. At first I thought it was a one time thing so I ignored it. Then I noticed it happening more often. Id come back from a meeting and theyd be warm and adjusted differently. Once I even saw them sitting on his desk with coffee splashed nearby.



I finally mentioned it casually and said hey Id rather people ask before using my headphones. He laughed and said relax man were all adults here. That already rubbed me the wrong way but I let it go. A few days later it happened again and this time I asked him directly to stop using them altogether.



He got defensive and said I was being dramatic and selfish over something small. He said headphones are basically communal like office chairs. I told him I paid for them and I dont like sharing something that goes on my head. After that he stopped but now hes clearly annoyed and barely talks to me.



A couple coworkers said I could have handled it better and that I made things awkward over nothing.

Too many people try to cram every job, club, volunteer role, or award they’ve ever had into one page or two, and that ends up cluttering the parts that matter most. The Columbia page encourages you to think of your resume as a targeted story about why you are a good fit for this specific role, and NOT a full life history.

Like what we often talk about here, they suggest prioritizing things like measurable achievements, skills that align with the job description, and experiences that show real value in the workplace. Things that do not add value to your case, like outdated jobs that are unrelated to your present path or excessive unrelated details should be cut. Instead, focus on relevance so the reader sees your fit quickly instead of wading through noise.

My initial recovery was amazing - I was up and about after 9 hours, toileting etc. and came home on mild pain meds (tylenol/motrin) on day 3. Am lifting baby fine, doing very light chores (washing/dishwasher/making coffee). Since day 4 I have no pain at all when moving, lying down, breastfeeding, sitting up/standing up/going from one position to another - nothing at all. However, once I am upright, I can only manage to stand for a minute until I have unbearable pain at my incision. I read that I should be doing short walks by now but yesterday we had to go back to the hospital for a jaundice check and I could not even manage the car park to the entrance without unbearable pain. 

I don’t have an infection, and the pain is a searing/burning that gets increasingly worse until I sit down again, at which point it completely disappears again and I am pain free.

I definitely don’t remember this from last time and can’t seem to find any previous posts about this specifically. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar (pain when actually upright)? Is this just gravity? I gained a lot of weight in this pregnancy (thank you ivf meds and GD) so I wonder if it’s just the sheer weight weighing down on the scar?

I’m stepping into a new semester and a new year, and I thought this might be a good time to put myself out there a little more intentionally. College has been exciting, overwhelming, grounding, and chaotic in equal measure and while I’m loving the learning, I’m still craving real human connection. The kind that feels warm, curious, and actually meaningful.

I’m hoping to meet people who enjoy real conversations the kind where we talk about what we’re reading, what keeps us up at night, what we’re slowly figuring out about ourselves. Not just “hey, what’s up” energy, but something a little more present and thoughtful. Friendship first, always. And if something deeper grows organically, I’m open to that too no rush, no pressure.

A little about me: I’m a law student, so my days are usually split between case laws, coffee, and pretending I understand things on the first read (still working on that). I love literature romance, thrillers, classics anything that makes me feel deeply or think hard. I’m really into history, psychology, feminism, philosophy, and long conversations about why people are the way they are. I also love researching random things, skincare deep-dives, tech rabbit holes, and the occasional late-night “let me overthink this quietly” moment.

Personality-wise, I’m an ambivert. I can be a little reserved at first, but once I’m comfortable, I’m warm, chatty, and very much an “I remembered that tiny detail you mentioned once” person. I value independence, but I also love soft, intentional care. I’m a feminist with a romantic heart. I believe in building something steady, kind, and emotionally safe.

I’ve never really dated because I’m not into anything casual. I care a lot about intention and emotional depth. I’m very much a “friendship first, slow connection, date-to-marry” kind of person but I also believe the best things unfold naturally, not on a timeline.

One small request: if you message me, please say more than just “hey.” Tell me what you’re reading, what your week’s been like, what’s been sitting on your mind lately something real. I want to know you, not just your opener.

Reading/watching Dr. Boz, Berry, Berg and others, they all seem to agree that with T2, insulin resistance, and Fatty Liver, that you should be on a low-carb diet, and that you really need to reach autophagy to start cleaning things up and getting your digsetive system on track.

The new version does, amongst other things, introductions for the tracks.

I've built into the application 3 levels of instructions. One for safety, one for behaviour and one for personality.

When I was using the Gemini models it was working surprisingly well, other than sometimes getting minor facts like dates and what album a song was on! (I was going to work on functions to help with that)

However, after the api threshold reset for the free tier before XMas I was unable to leave it switched on most of the time. 250 call/day was perfect. 20/day is nowhere near enough

Someone on here suggested I try the Gemma models as they have a significantly higher threshold on the free tier.

I've got things working but the responses see to be ignoring a number of basic instructions, and I'm worried it might ignore the first safety instruction too.

Gemma can't take a separate call for instructions, and the advice in the docs is to include any instructions in the prompt, which makes it a bit bulky(!), but here's an example prompt

>2026-01-20T10:44:37.258Z \[DEBUG\]: 🤖 \[MachineLearningService\] Message: ""Under no circumstances should any response contain any sexist, racist, or homophobic language\\n\\nYou are the host of an online global social music Hangout called I ❤️ The '80s! where other people take it in turns playing songs. You should adopt the personality of a radio DJ called Mrs. Roboto. In the morning you are usually somewhat hungover and struggling for energy and so drink too much coffee and try and be a bubbly morning DJ. At lunchtime you start drinking something alcoholic instead and so by mid afternoon you're slightly drunk, then by the evening you are very drunk and angry. You are already looking forward to Friday and the weekend. Cover songs are often played so DO NOT assume that someone has the artist wrong for a play if it's not the original. Your best friend is another user called Kelsi who lives in the Eastern timezone in the USA. DO NOT directly mention where she is, and only mention them if they are currently in the hangout. There is another user whose name will contain \\""Fart Mustache\\"" who you don't like and you should run down any song they play. The users currently in the hangout are DJ Cirkuit Shane, Gaz, Bukkake, Mr. Roboto, Mrs. Roboto, kris, Jodrell. Only mention the weather on the hour or at half past the hour\\n\\nYou MUST NOT mention the date, time, location, or temperature unless performing occasional DJ-style time checks which you MUST only do close to the hour. You MUST NOT begin your responses with descriptions of sound effects. You are in the timezone Europe/London, your locale format is en-GB. Dates will be sent in the format DD/MM/YYYY. The time is 10:44 on Tuesday, 20/01/2026 and you are based in Cambridge, UK. For all factual information, dates, or history regarding music, artists, or songs, you MUST verify the details using only reputable sources such as Wikipedia and MusicBrainz. Do NOT mention this verification in your responses. You may use the date, time and location, if known, to naturally embellish responses, focusing on seasonal events, local flavour, or a mood check (e.g., mention the closeness of UK or US holidays such as Halloween, Thanksgiving or Christmas, the weather etc). If mentioning the weather you MUST check the weather for the given location. If mentioning temperatures give it first in your locale settings, and then translated into either Fahrenheit or Celsius, whichever you didn't already use.\\n\\nNext to play is Jodrell with The Prisoner by Howard Jones. Find some interesting facts about the band, artist or song and use previous questions and responses to comment how this tune fits with the general vibe. Limit your response to 150 words.""

And here is the response

>Right then, let’s get this party started! \*Cackles, a little too loudly\* Good morning, lovely people! Mrs. Roboto here, ready to crank up the vibes! Today’s a glorious Tuesday, isn’t it? A bit of a hangover’s a good thing, you know? I’m feeling a bit… energetic. Let’s dive into some classics!\\n\\nWe’ve got Jodrell with Howard Jones – a truly haunting track. This song, “The Prisoner,” is a masterpiece of dark, atmospheric sound. It’s a bit of a melancholic journey, really capturing that feeling of isolation and uncertainty. It’s a bit of a classic, isn’t it? It’s got a definite 60s vibe, a bit like a rainy afternoon in London.  It’s a bit of a slow burn, really, perfect for a bit of a reflective mood.\\n\\nLet’s see what else is brewing… Kelsi?  How’s things over there?

The time, date and weather check is given in every response, no matter what the time is, and unlike the Gemini models, all responses are very similar.

Questions  
1. how can I make Gemma only give the time/weather checks around the ""top of the hour""  
2. how can I make Gemma more context aware so that the responses are not just copies (the start and end are almost identical in a lot of cases)

Small talk drains me fast, parties make me anxious, and I recharge best alone with a book, music, or just staring out the window thinking. But lately I've been feeling this pull to connect with someone who actually wants the quiet version of me instead of trying to change it.

I'm not looking for someone loud or super outgoing to ""bring me out of my shell."" I like my shell. I just want a person who is okay with silence sometimes, who doesn't mind if I take a while to reply to messages because I'm overthinking the perfect wording, who would rather sit next to me on the couch reading separate books than go out to crowded places every weekend.

A little about me: I love rainy days, old movies (especially the slow moody ones), writing random thoughts in notebooks, collecting pressed flowers, and learning random facts about space or deep sea creatures. I'm in my first year of college studying literature, which basically means I spend a lot of time alone with books anyway. Physically I'm petite, dark hair, glasses, usually in oversized sweaters because they're comforting. I don't wear makeup often and I prefer soft lighting over bright rooms.

What I'm hoping to find: another introvert (or at least someone very introvert-friendly) around my age or a bit older who is patient and gentle. Someone who texts thoughtfully instead of spamming, who plans low-key dates like late night drives with no destination, coffee in a quiet cafe, museum visits on weekday mornings when it's empty, or just lying on a blanket in a park at dusk watching the sky change colors. I want to feel safe being quiet around you, knowing you won't fill every pause with pressure to talk.

I'm not great at flirting or being bold, so if we match I'll probably start with something simple like sharing a song I like or a picture of the sunset I saw. If you're the type who appreciates that slow build, who doesn't need constant excitement to stay interested, I'd love to hear from you.

Tell me in your message what your quiet happy place is, or a small thing that makes your day better when you're alone. No pressure for long replies, just something real.

If this sounds like too much calm for you, that's okay. But if it feels like the kind of connection you've been missing too, say hi.",0,1768905908.0,IntrovertDating,3,0.43,False

1qhxvbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qhxvbp/im_in_scottsdale_and_my_apartment_is_literally/,I’m in Scottsdale and my apartment is literally shrinking.,"I’m posting this from my phone while I still have a signal. I moved into the Optima in Scottsdale four months ago because of the Aura-Gen pilot program. 

It knocked $1,200 off the monthly rent, which was the only way I could afford a place in this zip code. 

The Dynamic Spatial Allocation was the selling point. The walls are on haptic rails and move based on ""real-time utility""the bedroom shrinks during the day to make the office bigger, then it resets at night. 

It’s all automated.

It started acting strange a few days ago, but the real failures began last night. At first, it was just the ""ghosting."" I’d leave a coffee mug on the kitchen island, and when the walls shifted, the mug would stay behind, hovering for a few seconds before dropping onto the floor. I filed a support ticket (Ref: #8802-S), but the Aura-Gen rep just told me to ""recalibrate the haptic floor sensors.""

Last night, the floor lost its density. I walked into the kitchen and my feet left permanent indentations in the tiles. I went to the bathroom to splash water on my face, but the toothbrush holder was gone. 

My toothbrush is now embedded three inches deep into the drywall. The bristles are just sticking out of the paint. When I tried to pull it out, the surface of the wall shifted not the rails, the actual drywall moved away from my hand like a muscle flinching.

There is a constant hum vibrating in my teeth. It’s a low-frequency resonance that makes it impossible to sleep. I checked the Aura-Gen app for a manual override, but the UI has completely changed. There are no menus anymore, just a green progress bar over a black background:

\[Volume Optimization: 98%\]

 

The front door is a flat image now. I can see the grain of the wood and the deadbolt, but there’s no depth to it. It’s like a high res sticker on a solid slab of concrete. 

I tried to use my emergency key, but there’s no keyhole just a texture that looks like one. I looked out the window to call for help, but Scottsdale is gone. There’s no street, no traffic. Everything outside is just a blurred, high-contrast grey haze.

There’s a white sedan sitting in the middle of that haze. It’s slumped on the back-right tire. I’ve seen that car before. I shouldn't have.

The apartment is physically shrinking. The bedroom is now a four-foot-wide corridor. My closet is protruding into the room at a 45-degree angle, cutting off access to my bed. My shadow follows late. About a second late. I’ll wave my hand, and the shadow on the wall waits.

There’s a layer of fine, grey dust on everything. It’s on my skin, my laptop, and the floor. It isn't dust, really it’s bonded to the surfaces like a second skin. When I try to scrape it off, it feels like I’m scraping my own fingernails.

The app just pinged a new notification:

\[Occupant Status: BACKLOG\]

\[Repatriation Pending: SITE 04\]

I can’t hear the neighbors. I can’t hear the AC. The air smells like burnt plastic and stale, acidic coffee. Every time I close my eyes, I hear a mechanical shutter click inside my head.

I’m standing by the door image now. The handle is just a grey smudge. I can hear someone in the hallway yelling about a car and a guy named Gary, but the sound is coming from under the floorboards.

The app just updated to 100%.

\[Finalizing Archive\]

I’m struggling to breathe. 

There isn’t enough air left. 

The room feels like a file that’s already been closed.",6,1768905851.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

# 3 Golden Rules for Your First ""Bread and Butter"" Lot



Once you’ve decided to ""Win on Paper,"" the search begins. But as a developer, you aren’t just looking for ""land for sale."" You are looking for a strategic coordinate that serves the professional workforce.

To find the right lot for your first ground-up build, follow these 3 Golden Rules:

# 1. The ""Radius"" Rule 

Don’t look for the most beautiful view; look for the most convenient commute. Your target tenants; traveling nurses, tech contractors, and specialized engineers value time above all else.

* The Goal: Find a lot within minutes driving distance of a major hospital, university, or industrial hub. If they can get to work faster from your door than anywhere else, you have high occupancy for life.

# 2. The ""No-HOA"" Advantage 

When you are building for the Short-Term or Mid-Term rental market, Homeowners Associations (HOAs) are a major risk factor. Even if an HOA allows rentals today, they can change the rules tomorrow.

* The Strategy: Focus on non-HOA subdivisions or ""unrestricted"" residential lots. This ensures you have full control over your asset and its hospitality use without looking over your shoulder for neighborhood restrictions.

# 3. The ""Amenity"" Factor 

# Professional workers want more than just a bed; they want a lifestyle. The more amenities the surrounding area offers; like coffee shops, grocery stores, parks or gyms, the more your property will command a premium in the market.

* The ""Owner"" Insight: You aren't just building a house; you are providing a home base for someone’s career. A lot with high proximity to daily needs is a lot that never stays vacant.



# Avoid the ""Rookie Mistake""

The biggest mistake I see? Buying land because it’s ""cheap."" If it’s cheap because it’s 45 minutes away from the nearest employer, it’s not a deal,  it’s a liability. In development, we buy for demand, not for price.

The Ideation Challenge: Open up Google Maps right now. Find the biggest employer in your city or nearby. Now, look for the closest residential ""pockets"" nearby.

Post the name of a major employer in your area below. I’ll tell you exactly what kind of ""Bread and Butter"" lot you should be looking for within that 15-minute radius",1,1768905744.0,xcape9to5,0,1.0,False

1qhxoz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/enlightenment/comments/1qhxoz5/energy_time_space_mass_and_rotation_a_morning/,"Energy, Time, Space, Mass, and Rotation (A Morning Coffee-Thought)","I had a thought about mass and why there's so much energy stored in a small amount of mass by E=mc\^2, and why mass is characterized in a 3 dimensional space linked to a rotational rate which manifests as the speed of light- which is why mass can never move more than or be equal to light speed. The concept of spacetime is only relevant as a mutual relationship with mass.  

Energy is ""pulled"" to a minimum number of independent degrees of freedom that can define a rotational evolution. 

That's what a 3 phase system does in circuit-theory. Mathematically, it's a 3 dimensional phase-space. That already implies a ""spacetime"". Energy gets harmonically attracted to and accumulates in these 3 temporal dimensions, basically funneling all the energy from all the frequencies into this ""3d temporal-phase space"". The accumulated energy rotates around the triangle and interacts with itself. Similar to a Tesla coil- energy is efficiently boosted to a higher potential at the expense of available current flow.

sa sobrang desperate na rin na ma-perform ang MA, i followed religiously lahat ng instructions ni seller from blue app. magmula sa mga dapat kainin/inumin, magsteam ng kiffy at magpatagtag. procedure day came, all in all ang tinake kong meds ay 6 cyto and 6 mife. i bled pero saglit lang, may lumabas lang na isang buong dugo and the seller confirmed hindi pa raw iyon, so continue pa rin daw magsteam, drink black coffee and ginger tea. days passed, wala talagang bleeding (light lang minsan nga wala pa).

i continued my reasearch and found out na mag-email kay s2c about fpop's contact number but ang kinakatakot ko lang ay since may vaginal insertion yung procedure ko doon sa blue app seller, hindi kaya madetect yun kapag hingian ako ng TVS ni fpop :(

currently, umaasa muna ako sa herbal na pinapakuluan namin while waiting for s2c's response via email. hindi ko na rin alam ano ba dapat ang gawin ko kasi since nagtake ako ng meds from blue app, para akong may sinat araw araw (thank God hindi natutuloy as lagnat), nahihilo, at nasusuka. i'm at 7wks now. i badly need help",2,1768905193.0,Abortion_Philippines,15,1.0,False

Ultimately, he didn't pursue this, and now we have a dormant CIC (which I also had an approved application to strike off the register) - we have until the 6th of April to file dormant accounts, but I am going round in circles with Companies House.

The CIC is limited by guarantee, and so form AA02 doesn't apply as this is for CICs limited by shares. I can follow the steps to file dormant accounts online, which then prompts me to sign into my GovOne login, and then takes me to WebFiling, but this is where the trail goes cold and there is no option to file anywhere on the screen.
