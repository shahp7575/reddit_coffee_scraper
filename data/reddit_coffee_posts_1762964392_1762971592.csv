1ovbpjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1ovbpjr/my_wishing_balls/,My Wishing Balls,"My Wishing Ball

*Auto correct got me in the title 😅*

Referring to yourself as *Your wishing ball* felt good. The sense of being someone’s *something* is absolutely something I've longed for for a long time. But I understand the context and what you meant with it. 

For the record, I have never in my life pined over anyone for this long. This is new to me. it's never happened before, and I dont know why this is. I have a few ideas, but i will save writing those out for another time.
Best guess? It's because everything feels incomplete and unfinished. We had made a lot of plans in a very short amount of time. None of them came to fruition since it ended so abruptly. 

Alot of it also has to do with those 9 months. 9 months of *what if*. I stated before that I would have moved mountains if it came down to it. Primarily because I found myself *not opposed* to the idea at all. I grew excited, and I had hoped...  

I know i will get over it. Like all things, this too shall pass. 

Would you believe me if I said I shared similar daydreams? Maybe that's why it's difficult to let go. Why im stuck in this loop of the *what ifs*. Granted, some of my daydreams are a little different... Slow dancing in the kitchen waiting for the cinnamon buns? You're wearing only an apron with a handprint of flour. Long drives, looking over at each other? It's because we need to pull over somewhere... discrete. Or Two people reconnecting after pining over each other for so long over one, intense, explosive evening. 

But some of them are daydreams of normal, everyday, mundane things. Like tag teaming the dishes, going for a long walk to the European grocery story to pick up some food, a coffee, then walking back to cuddle under the blanket on the couch sipping our warm beverages because its cool outside. Learning a new recipe and cooking it together. And lastly... having someone to hold in my arms at night as we drift asleep. Nighttime is the most difficult for me and has been for the past 9 years. It's where I feel the most alone, and when im lying there having trouble falling asleep, that's when I daydream. That's when I do most of my writing, because that's when I do the most thinking. Or overthinking for that matter. 

I had a strong desire to reconnect in more ways than one. That much should be obvious by now. But after the last time, i never reached out because I knew how it would end, exactly how it is now. You made it very clear that our paths already diverged when i asked you to be very sure it's what you wanted. I did not expect us to reconnect at all ever again under any circumstance, but it's going as I expected it would. It was not my intention to speak again in this way. You did not have to respond, but you did. 

I had hoped for more. Not from writing about our night or the first unsent letter the other day. That was me writing as a form of cathartic release. But i had hoped for more long ago. But your letter brought clarity. You’ve found your own sense of peace and closure. 

Circumstances kept you from seeing all of me, and in some ways, they kept me from being fully seen. I wish you could have seen more because I’m capable of more than those brief moments revealed.

It’s hard to accept that I was a temporary stop on your journey. Im tired of being everyone's lighthouse. While I may be in calmer waters now, im continuing on my journey without a map seeking the light of my own home port. Im starting to believe it doesn't exist and that this is my purpose in life. Its always *someone else* that gets to enjoy the benefits, be with people i care about, or even tuck my daughter in for that matter. 

Oh well... 

I encourage you to continue writing. You are a talented writer. Write as a form of cathartic release. Write for fun. Write about whatever it is that is challenging you. Ask as many questions as you can. Find your community. I even challenge you to write about our night from your perspective. There’s peace in that if you allow it. It helped me. But that is wishful thinking as well. 

I've accepted that I may never find my home port. I've heard all the clichés many times before. It seems to be a pattern, and to be frank, im sick of hearing it. For once, I want someone to tell me the truth. Even if it hurts. I've heard things like 

- *Right person wrong time* 
- *Twin Flames*
- *If you love someone, let them go...* 
- *You deserve someone more*

Yes, I've heard it all many times over from a lot of people. 

After everything I've been through, from childhood to the present, I fear im just too damaged, too far gone for anyone to appreciate fully. I've come to terms with that. That's why no one stays, no matter the circumstances.  

My door remains open if you ever wish to reconnect, I know you've known this, and I know you won't. You know where to find me and message me. The wishing ball is in your court now. Should you ever need *your lighthouse*

This will be my final direct letter. You didn't need to respond before, and you dont have to now. I left you an opening by saying I truthfully missed you. Your reply was a finality, about closure, and of endings. You remain firm, steadfast, and resolute in your decision to remain in your situation. I know the tone of this one is different. Don't think of it as you specifically. Think of it as the last drop that filled the cup, causing it to spill over after 20 years of waiting. This is probably another reason letting go has been difficult. Im just so fed up with it, i dont want to let go anymore or br let go. So before I go, allow me to leave you with the words of someone greater, who can offer far more perspective, and perhaps a solution. 

*Corinthians 13:4-7*
*Philippians 4:6-7*

I will be okay. I will keep my promise to keep away. 

Your lighthouse,

Is there a way to learn only the parts that actually make money?","Hey everyone, I'm new and feeling completely overwhelmed.

My goal is simple: I want to build a small niche site (e.g., reviewing coffee makers) and earn my first $1,000 in Amazon commissions.

My problem: I've tried to learn. I've read all the ""guides"" (Neil Patel, Ahrefs blog, etc.) and I've bought a 50-hour video course. But it's all *fluff*. They spend 5 hours on ""what is marketing"" or Google's 100-page ""E-E-A-T"" theory.

I don't have 500 hours to learn ""the history of SEO."" I'm not trying to get a marketing degree. I just want to learn **how to write one single review article that ranks on Google and gets clicks.**

I'm at the point where I'm just fantasizing about a tool or a method that *doesn't* waste my time. I wish I could:

1. Tell the tool: ""My *only* goal is to write a 'Best Coffee Makers 2026' article. **Ignore all other marketing theory.**"" (`<-- Scoped Context`)
2. Have it *visually connect* the concepts for me. Like a **mind-map** that shows me *how* my ""Keyword Research"" (e.g., ""best espresso machine under $200"") *directly links* to the *exact* ""Article Headlines"" and ""Review Structure"" I need to use. (`<-- Knowledge Graph`)
3. Be able to ask it *specific*, practical questions: ""Walk me through, step-by-step, *why* this #1 ranking competitor's review is winning. What subheadings are they using? What's their call-to-action?"" (`<-- Precision Q&A`)

Does anything like this exist?

My boyfriend and I have been inspired by your amazing, creative projects, and wanted to ask for your advice and ideas.

For Christmas, we want to make a project together to keep and display them, something that can grow with us as we make more memories.  (Or we can create new projects over time...)


We thought about shadow boxes, but we’re not sure if that’s the best long-term option for both flat and bulky items. We’re not super skilled, but we can handle basic sewing, gluing, and simple assembly.  At our library, they have a 3-d printer, laminator, laser cutter, and other tools.


If you’ve ever made something to save memories or keepsakes, we’d love to hear what you did or see pictures if you’re proud of it. You all are so creative, and we're hoping to borrow a little of that brilliance for our project.

# Why adobe is a Bad Move

Adobe has gotten really aggressive with anti-piracy measures. The cracked versions:

* Leave watermarks and metadata traces in your exports
* Can get your content flagged or penalized by social media platforms
* Carry serious malware risks (especially dangerous if you work with client data)

# The Smart Alternative: Group Licensing

Here's what many people don't know: **legitimate company accounts exist for as low as $1-2 per month.**

Companies and resellers in lower-income regions (Mexico, India, Bangladesh, Southeast Asia) offer access to their legitimate business/education licenses at massive discounts. These are:

* ✅ **Legal** – Real Adobe accounts, not cracked software
* ✅ **Safe** – No malware, no security risks
* ✅ **Reliable** – Full features, regular updates
* ✅ **Platform-safe** – No content flags or penalties

# My Experience

I've been using this method for a year now. Paid **$15 for 12 months** of full Creative Cloud access. The peace of mind alone is worth it – especially when you're working with client files and can't afford a security breach or data loss.

# Where to Find These

Search for terms like ""Adobe group buy"" or ""Adobe shared account"" on forums and Telegram groups. Do your research on the seller's reputation before buying.

**Bottom line:** For the price of 1-2 coffees, you can work professionally without the constant anxiety of using pirated software. Your career deserve better than malware-infected cracks.",0,1762968036.0,PiracyBackup,15,0.34,False

However,  i had the baby at 7 months and he was stillborn, we grieved but kinda expected it since the doctor had told us this was a big possibility. Nolan and I stayed married but due to unrelated reasons he got into drugs, we both were in different uni‘s he was a part time student and had a job like me and at that point cut off from family. He got into pretty serious stuff and I supported him, we tried rehab, and so on but I was also 20 and admit I didn’t handle the situation as well as I could’ve.

It got worse and he started dragging me down, telling me I could drop out of uni like him and more. We had a really intense argument about how if he went back to his rich ass parents they would fund his entire life so he could be lax but I don’t want to depend on anyone and so on. long story short we got divorced at 22.

I went to law school and not to boast but I did amazing. However, on rough nights Nolan would still call defeated and I would help him, sometimes he would beg for a coffee date and I would go so I wasnt the best with boundaries, there were nights when we stayed together but we grew apart and when he ended up hospitalized due to drugs again I told him I never wanted to see him again, something i still regret but don’t at the same time. 

I heard about him through mutual friends, apparently he got clean, bettered his career and went back to his dad’s company or whatever I honestly didn’t fully believe it. I had a few on and off relationships but honestly my mind was on my career especially as I was articling at the time. His mother found me on Facebook and invited me a few times around 2 years ago.

Nolan would still dial my number many times and wish me birthdays, luck, and stuff under my posts and so on but I tried not to let it affect me, when he called me for a dinner date and stuff I told him to fuck off and not contact me ever. I know it sounds evil but I had been so hurt all those years ago through his drugs and the hope of him getting clean but getting crushed again, I just couldn’t do it again. 

Anyways, there was absolutely zero contact until 3 months ago when his mother messaged me on Facebook basically saying that I still had his grandmother’s engagement ring and to bring it back because she was thinking her son would soon propose to his girlfriend Katie. I won’t lie, I cried alot even if it didn’t make sense but I thought maybe this was the one thing I had to do to move on.

I drove to his mother’s house and she was actually quite cordial, she invited me in for coffee and had made some sandwiches. apparently Nolan and his father had gone golfing, we actually ended up chatting about those early days for a while and around two hours later a car pulled up and I literally felt like my gut was twisting but also weirdly excited. His mother was surprised as usually they came back from golfing in the evening not so soon, When Nolan entered his mother almost looked guilty for receiving me, with him was his father and girlfriend Katie.

it was so painfully awkward and the ring I had brought was on the counter so I just blurted out that i came here to give this and started gathering my stuff, Nolan quickly came to me and said I could keep it and he never wanted it back and wanted me to have it, Katie looked like she could kill me and went outside, I left the ring and drove back home.

After that incident I started getting texts from Nolan to keep the ring and some sentimental stuff and also separately from Katie who said I should have boundaries and move on. She even texted me something about Nolan and I only having a surface connection due to our stillborn which just weirded me out.

And last month I started getting texts from Katie about being a home wrecker, I heard from Nolan’s mother they had broken up and one of Nolan’s newer friends even reached out which I though was absurd and said i should let him be happy and so on. I’m so confused, what do I do? Aitah by starting the whole ring drama?

When we first started dating in September of 2022 my fiance, then boyfriend, went on a trip with his extended family. When he returned he gave me and his mother coffee mugs from the island he visited. I of course said thank you, but she just said ""why would you get me that?"" When we went on our first trip together in December 2022 we brought back t-shirts for my family and nothing for his family. He said he did  not want to bring gifts since his mom did not like them anyway. This caused her to begin attacking him over text message saying he was an ungrateful son and she couldn't believe that he would treat her that way.

 Apparently 1 day while we thought we were home alone, his 17 year old sister heard us having sex and told their mom. His mother told the entire extended family about it and called me a whore. Then about a week or so  later he did not wake up to his alarm clock. His mother was off work that day so she went into his bedroom and unplugged the alarm clock. She did not care if he got up or not as long as she did not hear the alarm while she enjoyed her coffee. I drove over to his house because I had not heard from him and knew he would sleep through a meeting with his boss and lose his job. After I knocked on the door and she did not recognize me, she woke him up to answer the door. He left for work but she continued to text and berate him about how she was ""done with this bullshit and he needed to find a new place to live."" He called me from work so upset that he couldn't get anything done. I texted him back at some point saying she was acting like a stupid bitch. She apparently found his apple watch and saw that I had called her a bitch. In retaliation she told him to get out of her house immediately when he got home from work, and called me a ""N\*\*GER loving whore"" and told him that I was just after his money. Because he was being kicked out so suddenly, my parents allowed him to move in with them. I was in school at the time and living at home. After staying with my parents for about a month he closed on a home and moved out alone. 

Seven months later I graduated college and moved in with him.  A few months after I had texted her apologizing for the things I said and did; his mother eventually sent me a text apologizing for hurting my feelings. I thought things were going to be mended. Until we told her that we were engaged and planning the wedding in 15 months. 

Over text, she told him that she did not support our marriage because of the things that happened at the beginning of our relationship and that she was praying for a different outcome.  A few weeks after this text we had a family Easter dinner at his grandmother's. His mother just pretended we weren't there. She heard me talk to everyone about how my mother had an emergency appendectomy the day prior. She did not say 1 word to us the entire day.  His grandmother told us that his mother is just acting this way because she feels left out. I forced my fiance to meet with his mother over the summer to talk about how she has been acting and the things she has said about me and my family.  She told him it was his fault our relationship was strained because he told me what she said about me and the names she called me. She did not want to move on or be involved in wedding planning. Instead, she told him that I'd eventually leave him and he wouldn't have my family anymore, so he would come running back to her. She told him that she was not coming to our engagement party because she was out of town with her new bf but then also said she did not want to come? She said she wanted nothing to do with the wedding planning or events because she does not support us getting married. 

However, she told him she was coming to the wedding. In his opinion it is just to save face because she knows it will look bad for her if she is not there. He thinks she just wants to be in the photos and look like a darling mother without apologizing.  I asked him how he would feel seeing his mother at our wedding. He said that it would only upset him if she did not apologize to us and take accountability and change her behavior. I am ready to move on as soon as she apologizes. 

We sent out wedding invitations this week. Including his sister who lives at his mother's address.  Are we assholes for not wanting to invite her unless she apologizes? ",2,1762967485.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

My alarm rang at 6:00. Senior day started early. Sleep had claimed me, but I was more tired than the day before.

I pitched myself out of bed and lumbered to the kitchenette. I almost fell asleep waiting on the coffee machine. I almost collapsed when I fell asleep in the shower. As I wrestled the morning, I admitted it was a fight I was going to lose. I won perfect attendance awards every year in grade school. My father never believed in sick days. That morning, I knew he was wrong.

I picked up my phone from where I threw it into the sheets. Bree had sent her morning briefing at 4:45. She survived on coffee and high-functioning anxiety. I texted back.

“Hey. Feeling sick. Can’t make it. Sorry.” Bree read the message immediately. I thought of calling her. It would have been the nice thing to do. The right thing. But I couldn’t bear to hear her voice. This time, there wouldn’t even be any anger to hide in. She would know something was wrong. I turned my phone on vibrate and tossed it on the couch.

I sat down and noticed that my head had stopped spinning. I hadn’t realized it had been reeling like what I have heard of hangovers. I didn’t remember drinking that much the night before, but the empty bottle judged me from bed.

Still, this wasn’t a hangover. It was less than that. And more. I didn’t just feel loopy. I felt like he was in the wrong place.

When I turned on the TV, the sound split my head with an axe. I turned down the volume, but the noise barely obeyed. Still, I needed the distraction. I clicked through the infomercials and syndicated sitcoms. Most people my age never even had a cord to cut, but Dove Hill local news and C-SPAN are free on cable. I haven’t watched anything else since those Saturday mornings with Bree.

During the hour’s changeover, local channel 3 airs low-budget ads for the dentist and the school and national spots for fast food and a new diabetes medication. The fifth ad was different though.

In it, a large man whose stomach was too big for his suit stood in front of a lot full of clearly used cars. The oversaturated light and amateur production value proved it was local, but there isn’t a used car dealership in 100 miles of Dove Hill. The man’s hair piece shook as he shouted his pitch. I felt nauseous watching it shiver.

“Hey, hey, hey! Come on down to Papa’s Playhouse where the low prices aren’t pretend!” My head cracked again as Papa’s shout made the TV impossibly louder. Under a slithering saxophone solo, the screen showed a line of cars that looked like they were manufactured well before the turn of the millennium. “Hurry quick because we aren’t hiding these deals! Seek them now before they’re gone!”

I breathed a sigh of relief when Papa left the screen. It was 7:00: time for the news. The music should have been the Muzak jingle that the station has used since the 1970s. Instead, it was Sunny Sandy singing her theme song. The piano that played along came from somewhere in my apartment.

By the time the ghostly piano played its last phrase, I was back in the center of the Square. No time had passed in the last day of my life. When I opened my eyes, Sandy’s were staring at me like I was a statue she was carving from stone.

“Now!” she said in a mechanical squee. “Where are my other friends?” It was time for another call-and-response. “Say it with me.”

After the compelled introduction, I didn’t even try to fight. I remembered my part. Together, we shouted, “Howdy dee! Howdy day! Where is everyone today?” When Sandy’s voice rose, it sounded like she was projecting to the last aisle of a crowded theatre.

The piano started up again. Its sound was distant. Was it still playing from my apartment? Or from the black above us? As its invisible mallets struck its hidden strings, the animals emerged from their rooms. One by one, they bounced towards Sandy and encircled her. I could tell that they had also learned to not struggle against their matriarch.

Maggie stood to my right; Tommy was to my left. The others—now including a purple pig and a silver spider—completed the embrace. I realized I had never seen them in full. They weren’t humanoid. They each kept their characteristic shapes. Maggie, Tommy, and the pig on all fours; the owl and the chickens on their talons; and the rabbit on its haunches. They weren’t humans, but they were people. With hearts and minds they were clinging to under Sandy’s uncompromising benevolence. Even before I was brought to the Square, I knew that pain. These were my allies.

“Thank you for joining us, friends!” Sandy believed it was a kindness to pretend like they had a choice. In the past, one of them might have corrected her. Now they didn’t dare. “I’d like you to meet our new friend: Mikey!” The animals smiled at me with a commiserating kindness. “He’s a very good boy.” I didn’t want to know what Sandy would become if I wasn’t.

“Now what are we going to do today?” I remembered that this is where every episode really started. Every day in *Sunnyside Square* started with a game, and each had very specific rules. I always liked that part of the show. I looked around the circle expecting one of my friends to answer Sandy’s question. When their lips pinched in silent fear, I remembered that this wasn’t the Square I had known.

“Oh! I know!” Her voice was that of a fairytale princess who had become an authoritarian monarch. “We’ll play Hide and Seek!” The animals stood quiet for a fleeting moment before the light coming from Sandy’s eyes turned harsh with confident expectation. My friends cheered as demanded. I followed their lead.

The red rabbit raised his paw and asked eagerly, “Sandy! Sandy! Can I please help teach our new friend the rules?” I noticed his foot thumping anxiously.

“Oh! That is such a sunny idea!” Sunny said. “Thank you, Rupert! That will be a very nice thing to do!” Rupert concealed a flinch when she gave his head a firm tap.

“Now, do we all remember the rules? I’m going to close my eyes and count to 100. Then you’ll all hide somewhere you feel safe. Then I’ll come find you.” There was a threatening fist in the velvet glove of that promise. “Mikey, Rupert will teach you the rest.” She giggled eagerly.

The animals nodded politely, and I played along. Sandy placed her hands over her eyes like the young playmate she still should have been. “One, two—”

This was my chance. I broke through the circle and towards the imposing front door. I took a short sigh of relief when I found it unlocked. As I ran out, I looked on with confusion at my animal friends walking grudgingly to their hiding spots. Didn’t they want to leave too?

Rupert was the only one to match my speed. He called out to me as we ran out of the park. “Wait! Stop! That’s not how the game works. Not anymore…” I didn’t stop to listen.

I first tried to hide in the post office right across the street from Sandy’s house. I flung open the door and started to enter. I forgot about the black behind the buildings. I caught my foot just as it was about to fall into an abyss swirling with trails of dust. Catching my breath for only a moment, I slammed the door as I ran around the Square.

Rupert did his best to follow along. “Mikey, let me help you. You know I’m your friend.” I wanted to trust Rupert, but I couldn’t trust anyone—especially in the Square.

Sandy was coming. Her voice blared from her house like a tornado siren. “Twenty-two, twenty-three…”

I passed more doors into the void. One for a bakery that didn’t exist. Another for what looked like a school. Then a church with a golden plaque reading “St. Beatrice’s.” All the while, Rupert hopped frantically behind me. “Please…”

I only stopped when I came to a long window with a real room behind it. It looked like a library. Like Mrs. Brown’s bookstore. I threw myself through the door as its bell tingled above me. Rupert finally caught up when I was hiding between two bookshelves that must not have been touched for an eternity. From my hiding spot, I could see the back of Sandy’s house through the window. Her garden was filled with statues of kind-looking creatures that I chose to believe were animals.

Sandy’s voice shined on. “Sixty-six, sixty-seven…”

Rupert hopped up. With me crouching, we were almost nose to nose. “Thank you. I was trying to follow you.”

“You’re welcome?” Something old inside me knew I shouldn’t be afraid of Rupert, but it wasn’t safe to trust him. It has been years since I truly trusted anyone but Bree.

“Now listen,” Rupert continued. “Hiding like this is not going to work. That’s not how Hide and Seek works. Not now.” I eyed him suspiciously. “The Square is too small for that. It’s not just about hiding your body. It’s about hiding your feelings. You have to be sunny. If she sees you looking scared or upset or angry or anything else…” Rupert’s muzzle quivered.

“Then…what happens?”

“You’re Out.”

“Out? What does that mean?”

“Seventy-nine, eighty…”

Rupert huffed with frightened impatience. “We’re running out of time.” My survival instincts held me in place. My bones told me I should take up less space.

“Out,” Rupert explained desperately. “Into the black behind the buildings. It’s dark and dusty and—”

“Ninety-nine, one hundred. Ready or not, here I come!”

I couldn’t move. Rupert matched his voice to the speed of his pounding feet. “Time and space don’t exist. It’s just you and the light beams too far above to see. You forget who you are: your thoughts, your feelings…even your name. Before long, you’re just…fine. Fine…but empty.”

Rupert’s ears twitched when he heard Sandy’s heels clacking on the bricks outside. I saw the front of her pink skirt intrude into the window.

“Mikey,” Rupert begged. “You have to feel better. *Now.*”

Sandy heard Rupert’s whisper shake. I saw her turn her rosy cheeks to stare through us. “Silly, Mikey! Silly, Rupert! There’s nothing to be afraid of. It’s just Sunny Sandy!” She continued her cheerful walk down the sidewalk.

I lunged from my hiding spot between the shelves and shouldered past Rupert. “I’m sorry. For everything.” I bolted out the door so narrowly that I could smell Sandy as she reached for me. She smelled like a candy-scented permanent marker.

My alarm rang at 6:00. Senior day started early. Sleep had claimed me, but I was more tired than the day before.

I pitched myself out of bed and lumbered to the kitchenette. I almost fell asleep waiting on the coffee machine. I almost collapsed when I fell asleep in the shower. As I wrestled the morning, I admitted it was a fight I was going to lose. I won perfect attendance awards every year in grade school. My father never believed in sick days. That morning, I knew he was wrong.

I picked up my phone from where I threw it into the sheets. Bree had sent her morning briefing at 4:45. She survived on coffee and high-functioning anxiety. I texted back.

“Hey. Feeling sick. Can’t make it. Sorry.” Bree read the message immediately. I thought of calling her. It would have been the nice thing to do. The right thing. But I couldn’t bear to hear her voice. This time, there wouldn’t even be any anger to hide in. She would know something was wrong. I turned my phone on vibrate and tossed it on the couch.

I sat down and noticed that my head had stopped spinning. I hadn’t realized it had been reeling like what I have heard of hangovers. I didn’t remember drinking that much the night before, but the empty bottle judged me from bed.

Still, this wasn’t a hangover. It was less than that. And more. I didn’t just feel loopy. I felt like he was in the wrong place.

When I turned on the TV, the sound split my head with an axe. I turned down the volume, but the noise barely obeyed. Still, I needed the distraction. I clicked through the infomercials and syndicated sitcoms. Most people my age never even had a cord to cut, but Dove Hill local news and C-SPAN are free on cable. I haven’t watched anything else since those Saturday mornings with Bree.

During the hour’s changeover, local channel 3 airs low-budget ads for the dentist and the school and national spots for fast food and a new diabetes medication. The fifth ad was different though.

In it, a large man whose stomach was too big for his suit stood in front of a lot full of clearly used cars. The oversaturated light and amateur production value proved it was local, but there isn’t a used car dealership in 100 miles of Dove Hill. The man’s hair piece shook as he shouted his pitch. I felt nauseous watching it shiver.

“Hey, hey, hey! Come on down to Papa’s Playhouse where the low prices aren’t pretend!” My head cracked again as Papa’s shout made the TV impossibly louder. Under a slithering saxophone solo, the screen showed a line of cars that looked like they were manufactured well before the turn of the millennium. “Hurry quick because we aren’t hiding these deals! Seek them now before they’re gone!”

I breathed a sigh of relief when Papa left the screen. It was 7:00: time for the news. The music should have been the Muzak jingle that the station has used since the 1970s. Instead, it was Sunny Sandy singing her theme song. The piano that played along came from somewhere in my apartment.

By the time the ghostly piano played its last phrase, I was back in the center of the Square. No time had passed in the last day of my life. When I opened my eyes, Sandy’s were staring at me like I was a statue she was carving from stone.

“Now!” she said in a mechanical squee. “Where are my other friends?” It was time for another call-and-response. “Say it with me.”

After the compelled introduction, I didn’t even try to fight. I remembered my part. Together, we shouted, “Howdy dee! Howdy day! Where is everyone today?” When Sandy’s voice rose, it sounded like she was projecting to the last aisle of a crowded theatre.

The piano started up again. Its sound was distant. Was it still playing from my apartment? Or from the black above us? As its invisible mallets struck its hidden strings, the animals emerged from their rooms. One by one, they bounced towards Sandy and encircled her. I could tell that they had also learned to not struggle against their matriarch.

Maggie stood to my right; Tommy was to my left. The others—now including a purple pig and a silver spider—completed the embrace. I realized I had never seen them in full. They weren’t humanoid. They each kept their characteristic shapes. Maggie, Tommy, and the pig on all fours; the owl and the chickens on their talons; and the rabbit on its haunches. They weren’t humans, but they were people. With hearts and minds they were clinging to under Sandy’s uncompromising benevolence. Even before I was brought to the Square, I knew that pain.

Maggie stood to my right; Tommy was to my left. The others—now including a purple pig and a silver spider—completed the embrace. I realized I had never seen them in full. They weren’t humanoid.

I only stopped when I came to a long window with a real room behind it. It looked like a library. Like Mrs. Brown’s bookstore. I threw myself through the door as its bell tingled above me. Rupert finally caught up when I was hiding between two bookshelves that must not have been touched for an eternity. From my hiding spot, I could see the back of Sandy’s house through the window.

Rupert’s ears twitched when he heard Sandy’s heels clacking on the bricks outside. I saw the front of her pink skirt intrude into the window.

“Mikey,” Rupert begged. “You have to feel better. *Now.*”

Sandy heard Rupert’s whisper shake. I saw her turn her rosy cheeks to stare through us. “Silly, Mikey! Silly, Rupert! There’s nothing to be afraid of. It’s just Sunny Sandy!” She continued her cheerful walk down the sidewalk.

I ran down the brick sidewalks and past more doors to Out. I didn’t know where I was going. I just had to get away from Sandy. As I turned the corner, my foot caught on the bend in the path. I tried to catch myself, but my elbow struck the ground. My arm vibrated down to the bone.

My alarm rang at 6:00. Senior day started early. Sleep had claimed me, but I was more tired than the day before.

I pitched myself out of bed and lumbered to the kitchenette. I almost fell asleep waiting on the coffee machine. I almost collapsed when I fell asleep in the shower. As I wrestled the morning, I admitted it was a fight I was going to lose. I won perfect attendance awards every year in grade school. My father never believed in sick days. That morning, I knew he was wrong.

I picked up my phone from where I threw it into the sheets. Bree had sent her morning briefing at 4:45. She survived on coffee and high-functioning anxiety. I texted back.

“Hey. Feeling sick. Can’t make it. Sorry.” Bree read the message immediately. I thought of calling her. It would have been the nice thing to do. The right thing. But I couldn’t bear to hear her voice. This time, there wouldn’t even be any anger to hide in. She would know something was wrong. I turned my phone on vibrate and tossed it on the couch.

I sat down and noticed that my head had stopped spinning. I hadn’t realized it had been reeling like what I have heard of hangovers. I didn’t remember drinking that much the night before, but the empty bottle judged me from bed.

Still, this wasn’t a hangover. It was less than that. And more. I didn’t just feel loopy. I felt like he was in the wrong place.

When I turned on the TV, the sound split my head with an axe. I turned down the volume, but the noise barely obeyed. Still, I needed the distraction. I clicked through the infomercials and syndicated sitcoms. Most people my age never even had a cord to cut, but Dove Hill local news and C-SPAN are free on cable. I haven’t watched anything else since those Saturday mornings with Bree.

During the hour’s changeover, local channel 3 airs low-budget ads for the dentist and the school and national spots for fast food and a new diabetes medication. The fifth ad was different though.

In it, a large man whose stomach was too big for his suit stood in front of a lot full of clearly used cars. The oversaturated light and amateur production value proved it was local, but there isn’t a used car dealership in 100 miles of Dove Hill. The man’s hair piece shook as he shouted his pitch. I felt nauseous watching it shiver.

“Hey, hey, hey! Come on down to Papa’s Playhouse where the low prices aren’t pretend!” My head cracked again as Papa’s shout made the TV impossibly louder. Under a slithering saxophone solo, the screen showed a line of cars that looked like they were manufactured well before the turn of the millennium. “Hurry quick because we aren’t hiding these deals! Seek them now before they’re gone!”

I breathed a sigh of relief when Papa left the screen. It was 7:00: time for the news. The music should have been the Muzak jingle that the station has used since the 1970s. Instead, it was Sunny Sandy singing her theme song. The piano that played along came from somewhere in my apartment.

By the time the ghostly piano played its last phrase, I was back in the center of the Square. No time had passed in the last day of my life. When I opened my eyes, Sandy’s were staring at me like I was a statue she was carving from stone.

“Now!” she said in a mechanical squee. “Where are my other friends?” It was time for another call-and-response. “Say it with me.”

After the compelled introduction, I didn’t even try to fight. I remembered my part. Together, we shouted, “Howdy dee! Howdy day! Where is everyone today?” When Sandy’s voice rose, it sounded like she was projecting to the last aisle of a crowded theatre.

The piano started up again. Its sound was distant. Was it still playing from my apartment? Or from the black above us? As its invisible mallets struck its hidden strings, the animals emerged from their rooms. One by one, they bounced towards Sandy and encircled her. I could tell that they had also learned to not struggle against their matriarch.

Maggie stood to my right; Tommy was to my left. The others—now including a purple pig and a silver spider—completed the embrace. I realized I had never seen them in full. They weren’t humanoid. They each kept their characteristic shapes. Maggie, Tommy, and the pig on all fours; the owl and the chickens on their talons; and the rabbit on its haunches. They weren’t humans, but they were people. With hearts and minds they were clinging to under Sandy’s uncompromising benevolence. Even before I was brought to the Square, I knew that pain. These were my allies.

“Thank you for joining us, friends!” Sandy believed it was a kindness to pretend like they had a choice. In the past, one of them might have corrected her. Now they didn’t dare. “I’d like you to meet our new friend: Mikey!” The animals smiled at me with a commiserating kindness. “He’s a very good boy.” I didn’t want to know what Sandy would become if I wasn’t.

“Now what are we going to do today?” I remembered that this is where every episode really started. Every day in *Sunnyside Square* started with a game, and each had very specific rules. I always liked that part of the show. I looked around the circle expecting one of my friends to answer Sandy’s question. When their lips pinched in silent fear, I remembered that this wasn’t the Square I had known.

“Oh! I know!” Her voice was that of a fairytale princess who had become an authoritarian monarch. “We’ll play Hide and Seek!” The animals stood quiet for a fleeting moment before the light coming from Sandy’s eyes turned harsh with confident expectation. My friends cheered as demanded. I followed their lead.

The red rabbit raised his paw and asked eagerly, “Sandy! Sandy! Can I please help teach our new friend the rules?” I noticed his foot thumping anxiously.

“Oh! That is such a sunny idea!” Sunny said. “Thank you, Rupert! That will be a very nice thing to do!” Rupert concealed a flinch when she gave his head a firm tap.

“Now, do we all remember the rules? I’m going to close my eyes and count to 100. Then you’ll all hide somewhere you feel safe. Then I’ll come find you.” There was a threatening fist in the velvet glove of that promise. “Mikey, Rupert will teach you the rest.” She giggled eagerly.

The animals nodded politely, and I played along. Sandy placed her hands over her eyes like the young playmate she still should have been. “One, two—”

This was my chance. I broke through the circle and towards the imposing front door. I took a short sigh of relief when I found it unlocked. As I ran out, I looked on with confusion at my animal friends walking grudgingly to their hiding spots. Didn’t they want to leave too?

Rupert was the only one to match my speed. He called out to me as we ran out of the park. “Wait! Stop! That’s not how the game works. Not anymore…” I didn’t stop to listen.

I first tried to hide in the post office right across the street from Sandy’s house. I flung open the door and started to enter. I forgot about the black behind the buildings. I caught my foot just as it was about to fall into an abyss swirling with trails of dust. Catching my breath for only a moment, I slammed the door as I ran around the Square.

Rupert did his best to follow along. “Mikey, let me help you. You know I’m your friend.” I wanted to trust Rupert, but I couldn’t trust anyone—especially in the Square.

Sandy was coming. Her voice blared from her house like a tornado siren. “Twenty-two, twenty-three…”

I passed more doors into the void. One for a bakery that didn’t exist. Another for what looked like a school. Then a church with a golden plaque reading “St. Beatrice’s.” All the while, Rupert hopped frantically behind me. “Please…”

I only stopped when I came to a long window with a real room behind it. It looked like a library. Like Mrs. Brown’s bookstore. I threw myself through the door as its bell tingled above me. Rupert finally caught up when I was hiding between two bookshelves that must not have been touched for an eternity. From my hiding spot, I could see the back of Sandy’s house through the window. Her garden was filled with statues of kind-looking creatures that I chose to believe were animals.

Sandy’s voice shined on. “Sixty-six, sixty-seven…”

Rupert hopped up. With me crouching, we were almost nose to nose. “Thank you. I was trying to follow you.”

“You’re welcome?” Something old inside me knew I shouldn’t be afraid of Rupert, but it wasn’t safe to trust him. It has been years since I truly trusted anyone but Bree.

“Now listen,” Rupert continued. “Hiding like this is not going to work. That’s not how Hide and Seek works. Not now.” I eyed him suspiciously. “The Square is too small for that. It’s not just about hiding your body. It’s about hiding your feelings. You have to be sunny. If she sees you looking scared or upset or angry or anything else…” Rupert’s muzzle quivered.

“Then…what happens?”

“You’re Out.”

“Out? What does that mean?”

“Seventy-nine, eighty…”

Rupert huffed with frightened impatience. “We’re running out of time.” My survival instincts held me in place. My bones told me I should take up less space.

“Out,” Rupert explained desperately. “Into the black behind the buildings. It’s dark and dusty and—”

“Ninety-nine, one hundred. Ready or not, here I come!”

I couldn’t move. Rupert matched his voice to the speed of his pounding feet. “Time and space don’t exist. It’s just you and the light beams too far above to see. You forget who you are: your thoughts, your feelings…even your name. Before long, you’re just…fine. Fine…but empty.”

Rupert’s ears twitched when he heard Sandy’s heels clacking on the bricks outside. I saw the front of her pink skirt intrude into the window.

“Mikey,” Rupert begged. “You have to feel better. *Now.*”

Sandy heard Rupert’s whisper shake. I saw her turn her rosy cheeks to stare through us. “Silly, Mikey! Silly, Rupert! There’s nothing to be afraid of. It’s just Sunny Sandy!” She continued her cheerful walk down the sidewalk.

I lunged from my hiding spot between the shelves and shouldered past Rupert. “I’m sorry. For everything.” I bolted out the door so narrowly that I could smell Sandy as she reached for me. She smelled like a candy-scented permanent marker.

I ran down the brick sidewalks and past more doors to Out. I didn’t know where I was going. I just had to get away from Sandy. As I turned the corner, my foot caught on the bend in the path. I tried to catch myself, but my elbow struck the ground. My arm vibrated down to the bone.

The animals nodded politely, and I played along. Sandy placed her hands over her eyes like the young playmate she still should have been. “One, two—”

This was my chance. I broke through the circle and towards the imposing front door. I took a short sigh of relief when I found it unlocked. As I ran out, I looked on with confusion at my animal friends walking grudgingly to their hiding spots. Didn’t they want to leave too?

Rupert was the only one to match my speed. He called out to me as we ran out of the park. “Wait! Stop! That’s not how the game works. Not anymore…” I didn’t stop to listen.

I first tried to hide in the post office right across the street from Sandy’s house. I flung open the door and started to enter. I forgot about the black behind the buildings. I caught my foot just as it was about to fall into an abyss swirling with trails of dust. Catching my breath for only a moment, I slammed the door as I ran around the Square.

Rupert did his best to follow along. “Mikey, let me help you. You know I’m your friend.” I wanted to trust Rupert, but I couldn’t trust anyone—especially in the Square.

Sandy was coming. Her voice blared from her house like a tornado siren. “Twenty-two, twenty-three…”

I passed more doors into the void. One for a bakery that didn’t exist. Another for what looked like a school. Then a church with a golden plaque reading “St. Beatrice’s.” All the while, Rupert hopped frantically behind me. “Please…”

I only stopped when I came to a long window with a real room behind it. It looked like a library. Like Mrs. Brown’s bookstore. I threw myself through the door as its bell tingled above me. Rupert finally caught up when I was hiding between two bookshelves that must not have been touched for an eternity. From my hiding spot, I could see the back of Sandy’s house through the window. Her garden was filled with statues of kind-looking creatures that I chose to believe were animals.

Sandy’s voice shined on. “Sixty-six, sixty-seven…”

Rupert hopped up. With me crouching, we were almost nose to nose. “Thank you. I was trying to follow you.”

“You’re welcome?” Something old inside me knew I shouldn’t be afraid of Rupert, but it wasn’t safe to trust him. It has been years since I truly trusted anyone but Bree.

“Now listen,” Rupert continued. “Hiding like this is not going to work. That’s not how Hide and Seek works. Not now.” I eyed him suspiciously. “The Square is too small for that. It’s not just about hiding your body. It’s about hiding your feelings. You have to be sunny. If she sees you looking scared or upset or angry or anything else…” Rupert’s muzzle quivered.

“Then…what happens?”

“You’re Out.”

“Out? What does that mean?”

“Seventy-nine, eighty…”

Rupert huffed with frightened impatience. “We’re running out of time.” My survival instincts held me in place. My bones told me I should take up less space.

“Out,” Rupert explained desperately. “Into the black behind the buildings. It’s dark and dusty and—”

“Ninety-nine, one hundred. Ready or not, here I come!”

I couldn’t move. Rupert matched his voice to the speed of his pounding feet. “Time and space don’t exist. It’s just you and the light beams too far above to see. You forget who you are: your thoughts, your feelings…even your name. Before long, you’re just…fine. Fine…but empty.”

Rupert’s ears twitched when he heard Sandy’s heels clacking on the bricks outside. I saw the front of her pink skirt intrude into the window.

“Mikey,” Rupert begged. “You have to feel better. *Now.*”

Sandy heard Rupert’s whisper shake. I saw her turn her rosy cheeks to stare through us. “Silly, Mikey! Silly, Rupert! There’s nothing to be afraid of. It’s just Sunny Sandy!” She continued her cheerful walk down the sidewalk.

I lunged from my hiding spot between the shelves and shouldered past Rupert. “I’m sorry. For everything.” I bolted out the door so narrowly that I could smell Sandy as she reached for me. She smelled like a candy-scented permanent marker.

I ran down the brick sidewalks and past more doors to Out. I didn’t know where I was going. I just had to get away from Sandy. As I turned the corner, my foot caught on the bend in the path. I tried to catch myself, but my elbow struck the ground. My arm vibrated down to the bone.

I heard Sandy’s heels walking up behind me. I couldn’t bear to look. “Oops! Did Mikey hurt himself? That’s what happens when you make mistakes. I’ll fix it.” Her sweetness made me want to vomit.",1,1762967315.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

**Here are some random things about me to see if we have a click :**  
I’m a 21 year old , I have ADHD (read: I find something new to fixate on every other week). I enjoy reading (currently reading: *Zomerhuis met zwembad by Herman koch*), journaling, baking, crafting. I love making a million playlists for every mood or vibe and end up never listening to them again (and then hoarding them on my iPod). I don’t enjoy watching movies but am into series (currently watching: Lang Leve de Liefde ,KOTH). I love going to cafés and drinking too much coffee or tea. I like playing online crossword puzzles, going down YouTube rabbit holes and reading random Wikipedia articles. I speak 3 languages and I’m slowly learning a 4th. And I’m up for talking to pretty much anyone to see if we have a click!

**Things to expect if we become friends**  
• Good morning messages (might not be sent in the morning)

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare your *frühstück*—this clash of Catalan flair and German efficiency is about to get *schaum* (foam) crazy. Let’s parse the numbers, news, and nonsense to see who’ll be sipping champagne after this EuroLeague showdown.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Lesson for the Ages

The odds tell a tale of two teams: **Bayern Munich** (-110 to -120 in American odds) is the bookmakers’ clear favorite, with implied probabilities hovering around **55-57%** to win. **Barcelona** (+205 to +220) checks in at **49-48%**, which is about the same chance as winning a raffle if you forgot to buy a ticket.

The spread? Bayern is favored by **1.5 to 2 points**, which in basketball terms is like saying a tortoise is favored to beat a hare in a 100-meter dash… but only if the hare stops to ask for directions. The total is set at **169.5 points**, suggesting this won’t be a defensive masterclass. Imagine two chefs arguing over who uses more salt—this game’s gonna *taste* salty.

---

### Digesting the News: Coaching Carousel and Late-Night Snacks

**FC Barcelona** is currently managed by Òscar Orellana, the interim coach who’s basically the NBA’s Tyronn Lue of basketball—someone thrown into the fire while the “real” coach (Xavi Pascual) finishes his coffee. The Blaugrana have lost two games in a row, including a *laughable* 96-78 drubbing by Bàsquet Girona. Their defense is like a sieve made of Jell-O, and their offense? Well, their star players might as well be shooting from the other team’s hoop.

Meanwhile, **Bayern Munich** has hit a five-game winning streak, fueled by **Spencer Dinwiddie**, the 32-year-old NBA veteran who’s basically a late-night snack for this team: unexpected, but *oh so satisfying*. Since his arrival, Bayern has gone from “meh” to “holy moly, who *is* this guy?

Steve Fischer dropping photo bombs: d4vd with Celeste on night of December 30, 2024 in downtown LA - 3 days before she was last known to be alive","In Steve Fischer's photo dump, we see d4vd flashing a knife...again! (Remember him flashing a knife that looks very similar in a stream?) This time he's at the corner of 3rd and Figueroa in downtown LA, and given the other photos that were in his camera, according to SF, we can assume Celeste was with him.

Funny thing, that corner is only a 20 minute walk away from one of the notorious residences in this case - namely the Vero Lofts on Wilshire Blvd., where Neo, Vanesa, and Hererra were photographed partying. (Some have speculated that this could have been the ""downtown"" apartment where Celeste was being kept at some point.)

Were you in the vicinity of 3rd and Figueroa in downtown LA on December 30, 2024 or the early morning of December 31, 2024? Do you know of any events that were happening in DTLA that night that might be noteworthy for the case?

I will say that I am a full-time student and do not have any debt.

# Day 1

**9am** Wake up and make myself breakfast using last night’s (gumbo) leftovers. Add an over easy-egg and slice up some apples to have on the side. Also make my daily oatmilk latte with my Breville.

**10am** Work on readings for my research paper. The material is interesting, but for some reason I feel sleepy and struggle to pay attention. The technical jargon is not helping. After about ninety minutes, I let the sleepiness win and crawl back into bed. 

**1pm** Wake up after an hourlong nap feeling refreshed! Shred some chicken and make myself a chicken-salad sandwich. Eat the sandwich with some carrot sticks and the rest of my apple slices.

**2pm** I’m determined to enjoy the fall foliage today. Seeing the leaves changing colors really gives me a dopamine boost, and I have a feeling a rainstorm coming next week might wash a lot of the leaves away. It’s a 20-minute uber or hourlong ride by transit to get to the park. I cheap out and pick public transit, reading an article in *The Atlantic* about Patrick Henry (the “give me liberty or give me death” guy) along the way.

**3pm** Make it to the park. I decide to pick a random path and start walking. It really is so beautiful, and not very crowded. As I’m walking by myself, of course I start thinking about the “You’re alone in the woods, would you rather run into a man or a bear?” question. The truth is, it really depends on the man.

**3:45pm** I stop for a moment in a particularly beautiful sunlit spot in the forest, just listening to the susurration of the leaves and the buzz of insects. It’s lovely.

**4pm** Since I don’t want to walk back the way I came, I call an uber. I realize I’m out of uber cash (I buy the digital gift cards from Costco because they’re 20% off), so I place a Costco order while I wait for the driver to arrive. On the ride back, I decide to pull the trigger on a ticket to a fall bike ride/fundraiser that’s happening next weekend ($65). I enjoy biking but haven’t done it in years. The uber ride is about $25, but I use part of the $100 credit I just purchased to cover it. **$145**

**4:30pm** I get back home and quickly type out an outline for an assignment that’s due tonight. With that done and submitted, I get ready for *Clue* night! I put on this gorgeous vintage-looking Tadashi Shoji midnight blue dress, my fake diamonds, and a teal scarf that’s really just a table runner I cut in half. Oh, and a teeny candlestick. If you couldn’t tell, I’m going as Miss Scarlett. I call an uber to meet up with my friend K. at the venue. *($13, paid with uber credit)*

**6:15pm** We wander around the venue, collecting clues and cocktails. Someone asks me if I’m Miss White, which I’m kind of offended by. Don’t get me wrong, Miss White is iconic (“flames, flames”), but I am *clearly* Ms. Scarlett.

**7pm** We solve the mystery, but we’re not the first so we don’t get the prize. It’s okay. I’m pretty drunk on cranberry French 75s at this point. The movie starts and they give us free popcorn! We also order some real food. I get steak with a side of broccolini, and K gets a burger. I steal some of his fries.

**9pm** K wins 2nd place in the costume contest (he brought a real wrench), and so we get a $25 credit towards our bill! I put the rest on my card and Venmo-request K for his portion. **$58**

**9:30pm** K drops me off at my apartment. I still feel quite drunk, so when I go upstairs I drink a lot of water and watch some Dropout clips on YouTube. I eventually muster the enthusiasm to go through my nightly routine and go to bed.

# Day 2

**5pm** Wake up against my will to a dry throat and what might be the start of a headache. I down half a glass of water and will myself to go back to sleep.

**9am** I get up for real (no headache!) and make myself some TJ’s knife noodles with an egg on top, along with my daily iced latte.

**12pm** I make headway on my research paper. I also place a Target delivery order for paper towels, soap refills, oat milk, hummus, and caramel apple lollipops. As I wait for my delivery, I prep and bake some tofu, and add some brown rice and roasted carrots for my lunch. **$52**

**1:30pm** I go visit my friend (and ex) S. at his apartment. S broke his ankle in a sports-related injury and so I help him bring some packages up to his apartment. We talk a bit (well, I talk, mostly about what I’m thinking about doing for a capstone project next semester). S and I get into a debate related to my potential capstone. I get the sense that S is disagreeing with me just to be devil’s advocate. It’s a little annoying, but he’s injured, so I let it slide.

**3pm** Walking back to my apartment, I notice a text from my college friend M. It’s a video of a beautiful French vineyard ... and ends by panning to her hand, on which there is a gorgeous, very unique ring on her ring finger (!). I obviously have to FaceTime her immediately. She’s engaged!! She and her partner have been together forever, so this totally makes sense. The proposal sounds so picturesque. I am very happy for her, though of course the tiny voice in the back of my head whispers “When will it be my turn to find true love?”

**4:30pm** I walk to campus for class. I meet up with my classmate and friend D beforehand to discuss our group project, but it just turns into him ranting about this club he was roped into. I personally think the club is a total disaster, so I feel immense schadenfreude as he describes how disorganized the leadership is.

**7:20pm** Class lets out a bit early, so I walk with another classmate to the nearby Mexican restaurant. I get a shrimp burrito and we chat for a bit about our capstone projects, as well as how bad we think our program’s curriculum is. Grad school is a scam, y’all. **$15**

**8:30pm** Back at my apartment. I wash the dishes from earlier and polish off a discussion post response. Somehow time flies and I don’t get in bed until 11:30. So much for trying to claw my bedtime back to 10/10:30pm. Oh, but I did reach a 100-day meditation streak on Headspace!

# Day 3

**5:30am** Wake up against my will again. My stomach is growling like crazy and I try to ignore it, but after about 20 minutes I get up and eat a bowl of cereal. I have this annoying thing where my body tends to wake me up one REM cycle before what I need for a “good night’s sleep”. Usually I can fall back asleep an hour later and get the last ninety minutes I need, but I’m worried because this is not a feasible sleep strategy for when I start working full-time.

**9am** Up for real this time. I finally polish off the gumbo leftovers, this time with scrambled eggs. I add too much butter to the eggs and they taste SO good. I also book my flight back home for winter break. Good timing, as my bank just gave me a 10% cashback deal for airline travel.  **$140**

**1pm** Catch the bus to campus. I want to fulfill my dark academia fantasy by re-reading *The Secret History* beneath the gothic buildings of my school. I also have a mug to give to one of my professors. As I head out, I realize I’ll miss the next bus if I walk, so I rent an e-scooter. **$5**

**2pm** Mug successfully delivered! I head to the grad student lounge where I heat up a lunch of baked tofu, roasted carrots, and brown rice leftovers.

**3pm** The weather is quite chilly, so I only read for about half an hour outside before seeking refuge in the library. Luckily, the space has a beautiful picture window facing the fall foliage.

**3:30pm** I’m craving a treat, so I go to a nearby bakery and get a red velvet cupcake and a decaf Americano. **$9**

**4pm** Take the bus to the satellite campus where my classes are. On the way, I have a zoom meeting for our group project. My teammates haven’t made much progress. Luckily, this is an open-ended project with a lot of solo work that doesn’t rely on their contributions. Still, I feel I’m always the one carrying group projects.

**5:30pm** I really don’t like this class and think it’s a waste of time. It doesn’t help that the instructor always spends the first 15 minutes trying to figure out how to operate the Zoom for students joining virtually (although she did bring candy this week ... so maybe my opinion of her is improving). Luckily, I can be on my laptop working on other stuff. I manage to submit a job application and work a bit on the project for the class I care about. I also end up buying a pair of pajamas from Costco. **$20**

**8:10pm** Back home and ravenous. I heat up a Trader Joe’s Orange Chicken Bowl and make some roasted broccolini. I watch a little bit of *30 Rock* to decompress.

**9pm** I have a long day tomorrow that starts early, so I really need to go to bed “early”. I wash my dishes, finish putting away my laundry, and get through my nightly routine.

**10:30pm** In bed. *Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.*

# Day 4

**6am** I’m up. Decide to get up instead of trying to grasp at another 30 minutes of sleep. At least now I can make it early enough to the conference to get the free breakfast. I make my latte to go and walk to the subway. As I leave my apartment, I can already feel my feet protesting about the (low) heels I’ve chosen. I have a moment where I consider switching shoes, but stubbornness and time management propel me forward. I notice my transit card is running low, so I reload it on my phone. **$20**

**7:45am** Make it to the hotel where the conference is being held! The breakfast is kind of sad, just fruit and some croissants. I spot a table with breakfast sandwiches, but a waiter stops me just as I go to grab one--apparently these are for attendees of the *other* conference happening in the hotel. Damn. I take my consolation croissants and head into the ballroom.

**8am** The conference is quite interesting! Especially when the speakers are not talking about AI. The room is very cold, though. I have to put my jacket back on, plus a beanie. I look at all the guys in suits and think about how air conditioning is sexist (an insane statement on its face, but true in my experience).

**11:40am** Lunch is served! It’s quite good. I have lo mein, fried rice, barbecued pork belly, salmon, salad, and mushroom soup. Yes, I eat way too much.

**1:15pm** I’m kind of crashing and can’t imagine sitting in a room all day, so I decide to go for a walk during a couple of talks I’m less interested in. My feet are on fire, but I hobble a couple of blocks to Anthropologie. I wonder if I’m the kind of person who would just go and buy herself sneakers in a moment of need. There’s a pair of New Balances that look nice and I know I’d get a lot of mileage out of, but alas I cannot bring myself to do it.

**2:30pm** Back for the last few talks. They have treats! I take a coconut macaroon and an M&M cookie. I can’t drink any more coffee, so I just have some hot water to warm myself up. One of the panels goes on and on about agentic AI, and I stave off boredom by placing an online order for a specific unscented lotion I can’t seem to find at the drugstore. **$5**

**4:45pm** The last talk just wrapped and I am officially running late for class. My professor is actually the one who told me about this conference/got me in, so I know he will understand. Still I send him an email on the uber ride back, telling him I’ll be late. The uber is $60, but will be reimbursed by my professional development fund.

**6pm** Walk into class very awkwardly. D is in this class as well, and razzes me for being so late. He says the professor was in Europe this morning but still managed to get to class on time--what’s my excuse? I think this is very funny.

**7:30pm** Break time! The professor hands out chocolates he got from Europe. I also brought caramel apple lollipops for the class (you can interpret this as me being generous, but the truth is I was craving one and didn’t want to eat the whole bag). 

**8pm** Class is out. I talk to the professor for a bit after class, mostly about the conference but also tangentially about the capstone project I’ll be doing with him next semester. We part ways and I decide to scooter back to try and save my feet. Before I start the ride, I place a Chipotle order on the app. Chicken bowl with a side of guac. **$20**

**8:30pm** Back home with my dinner. I am so tired. I shower, then eat half of my chicken bowl while watching the season finale of *Chad Powers*. It’s quite good! And I don’t care a wink about football. 

**10pm** Nightly routine, quick meditation, bed.

# Day 5

**6:30pm** I wake up feeling oddly refreshed. And ... horny. This always happens right before I get my period. (Side note/question for the culture: why do so few diaries mention things like sex, masturbation, or menstruation? On the one hand, I know it can get into TMI territory, and this isn’t meant to be a catalogue of every bodily function. Money diaries are primarily about money and how we spend it. On the other hand, I don’t see how it’s any more or less relevant than saying I drank a cup of tea.) Anyways, if you think such descriptions are inappropriate, just imagine curtains flapping in the breeze while I go to town on myself.

**7:30am** Up and at em. I have some raisin bread toast with butter and my decaf latte. 

**12:30pm** More progress on my essay! I think I will have the first draft done by tomorrow. I eat the leftover half of my Chipotle bowl, then walk to Trader Joe’s while listening to a career webinar. The webinar makes the job/workplace sound amazing, but they don’t really hire grads from the subfield I’m in. Oh well. My TJ’s bill is bigger than usual because I haven’t gone grocery shopping in a while. I’m proud of myself for only getting two “treats”--sipping chocolate and rosemary mixed nuts. I scooter back with my haul, using credits I bought yesterday. **$95**

**2pm** Back home, I put the groceries away and take a shower. Waste about an hour scrolling social media. Then I attempt a nap.

**3:30pm** Nap fails. That’s fine, I have stuff to do. I scooter to campus to find a place to work. I need to have an amazing idea for the capstone project I’ll do next semester. I’m hoping a whiteboard wall will help. I’m also supposed to get a card from one of my classmates who works at the campus bookstore. I can’t seem to find her, and somehow end up perusing the store and buying a plastic folder instead. **$5**

**5pm** The whiteboard wall delivers. I have an idea! I’m not sure how feasible it is, but the ambition of the idea excites me. I take a quick zoom meeting for the club that I’m a part of. We discuss potential activities for the rest of the semester. I really like the new woman on our board, she’s a go-getter with some great ideas. After the meeting ends, I manage to find my classmate and retrieve the card.

**6pm** Scooter back to my apartment in time for a workout! My building offers a free weekly exercise class taught by another resident in the building. I haven’t gone in months because of various illnesses/injuries/scheduling conflicts. I’m excited to be back! We voted for strength circuit. My favorite exercise involves picking up a sandbag and slamming it to the ground “like a pumpkin”. It is very cathartic.

**7:30pm** Shower and whip up dinner. It’s mostly the tofu-carrot-rice and broccolini leftovers, but I also bake some TJ’s veggie samosas. So good!

**8:30pm** I bought a candle last week to celebrate getting a certification, and I’m obsessed with it (Hinoki Fantome by Boy Smells). Somehow, it makes my apartment smell like mulled wine. I light it and read more of *The Secret History*.

**10pm** So sleepy. Bedtime routine, bed.

# Day 6

\[I’m writing the last two days of my diary a week after the fact, so forgive me for the relative lack of detail.\]

**9am** Yup. I got my period.

**1pm** Nothing like a dental appointment on Halloween! I tell my dentist I actually think this is the best time for a checkup, as I do all my Halloween candy-eating in the evening. The co-pay is **$66**

**2pm** Stop by the grocery store (and the liquor store) on my way back. I get just the necessities: chicken, dry pasta, clear plastic wrap ... and Lillet Blanc. I’ve been craving a French Blonde cocktail for months and am finally going to treat myself tonight. **$50**

**7pm** I’ve been vacillating all day about whether or not to go to a friend of a friend’s Halloween party. The weather is quite cold and windy, plus my social anxiety is simmering. I decide to stay home instead. It’s the right move! I mix myself the french blonde, which truly tastes like nectar of the gods. I then tipsily make a pot of chili while listening to Halloween songs on Spotify. God it is so awesome to be an adult sometimes.

**8pm** Purchase something from Amazon related to my research project. Hopefully I can get it reimbursed. **$31**

# Day 7

**9am** Up and at em. I’ve got the bike ride today! The weather is crisp and perfect for cycling. I don’t have a bike, so I pay for a day rental from our city’s bikeshare program. It’s a chill 15 minute ride to the start of the route. **$10**

**10:30am** The ride begins. I’m only doing the 10 mile version of the route, so my fellow riders are mostly families with small children. It’s actually perfect though, as my main goal is to enjoy the scenery.

**1pm** I’m over halfway done and have made it to the pit stop, where they have warm cider and donuts. I have a delicious chocolate coconut donut with my cider and take a bunch of selfies. I really need to change my tampon, but I’m not sure there’s a bathroom at this park. One of the ride marshalls walks by, and I ask him for directions. He points the way to the bathroom. We chat for a little bit about the race. I can’t help but notice he’s quite cute...

**1:15pm** Done with the ride! There was a half mile at the end that was a literal uphill battle, but overall I feel good about the experience. There’s supposed to be a meetup/celebration afterwards at the nearby brewery. I don’t really feel like drinking, but maybe I will run into cute biker boy (CBB).

**1:30pm** I’ve returned my bike and scoped out the bar, but no sign of CBB. I’m checking my phone and trying to muster the leg strength to stand up and head out when ... CBB appears. He asks if he can sit down and suddenly my fatigue vanishes. 

**2:30pm** I end up ordering a hard cider so I can talk with CBB longer. We have a great chat! He tells me more about the city’s biking scene. During our conversation, I try to mentally telegraph to him that I want him to ask for my number. I know I should be a feminist and ask for his number, but ... it’s scary to put myself out there. Luckily, my “subliminal messaging” works and he asks if we can exchange numbers. He bikes off and I walk to the subway with a stupidly big grin on my face. **$10**

**3pm** Arrive home, wolf down leftover chili, and try to take a nap before a group project meeting I have at 4:30.

**4:30pm** My alarm *rips* me from sleep in a way that leaves me very groggy and disoriented. I manage to get through the meeting and try to nap again, but I’ve angered the sandman with my poor sleep hygiene.

**7pm** Eventually I give up, get up, and have my weekly FaceTime call with my family. I tell them all about the bike ride, leaving CBB out of the story. We’ll see if he gets elevated to a recurring role in later episodes.

**9pm** Still so hungry. I make a little pasta dish with linguini, garlic, butter, shredded chicken, spinach, and cherry tomatoes. Then, as soon as I’ve digested a little bit, I do my nightly routine and collapse into bed.

Reflection: This was a spendy week for me, but I have no regrets! Writing this diary also made me more mindful and appreciative of the “small moments” in my life. Finally, this experience gave me greater admiration for all the ladies who write and submit diaries! My diary took me at least 4 hours to write/edit. However, I consider it time well-spent. I hope others continue to submit diaries to this subreddit, as this is one of my favorite corners of the Internet.

I am looking for advice for myself (40F) and my 20 year old daughter.  She was at an appt recently and was told her thyroid was enlarged.  She had the ultrasound and they found 3 nodules. Recommendations: One is no follow up, one is one year follow up, third is biopsy. She has it scheduled for December 11th. 

The day after she got her results, I had a doctors appt (different doctor) and they told me that MY thyroid is enlarged and “lumpybumpy” so ordered an ultrasound. Waiting to schedule that.  My blood work came back normal (Thyroxine (T4) Free, Direct was 0.95 and TSH was 1.300)

As I read about thyroid issues,I have had symptoms of swollen thyroid.  I have had a lump in my throat, uncomfortable swallowing and have to clear my throat a bit in the morning and I felt like my voice changed although no one else will agree with me. It does seem to get better when I eat better and lay off the coffee so I assumed it was from acid reflux. Now I’m not too sure.  I am dealing with other issues (facial flushing) which I’m being tested for food allergies and histamine intolerance next month and my occasional diarrhea (like 1-2 days a month) and ofc I read about medullary thyroid cancer and how that’s a symptom and now I am really concerned!  It’s been blown off as rosacea for years so I’m really worried.

Does it seem super odd that myself and my
Daughter both are dealing with this at the same time?  Any words of advice or comfort for the biopsy, my ultrasound and just generally being really worried?  My daughter is giving

In which the main character runs a nightly smuggling operation between his bedroom and another world entirely. 

Each night, he gets a random litRPG ability (That's where the rougelite comes from) and if he does well enough, he gets to keep that ability to pair up with future random boons - meaning each night is a scramble to prepare the best ways to abuse whatever random boon the System throws at him, and hope he can get back home to Earth with all the loot (That's the extraction part.)

Also there's 99 others getting tossed into this world, so good luck with that problem.

1ovakiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuroPsychCounselling/comments/1ovakiy/calgary_psychology_counselling_when_the_light/,Calgary Psychology & Counselling – When the Light Fades – Understanding Depression & Low Mood (and How to Re-Kindle Your Inner Spark),"You wake up and the world seems a shade grayer. The coffee smells bland. Your to-do list sits there, but you can’t quite muster the will to engage. You tell yourself, “It’s just a rough patch,” but days turn into weeks, and the heaviness lingers.  
If this resonates, you’re not alone — and what you’re feeling is real. It might be a prolonged low mood, or it may meet the criteria for a clinical depression. But the good news: you *can* act. Understanding what’s happening, from brain circuits to life context, is the first step.

# What Are Depression & Low Mood?

“Low mood” is a state we all experience — sadness, lack of motivation or interest, fatigue. It becomes more serious when it persists, interacts with other symptoms (like changes in sleep, appetite, and self-worth), and notably impacts functioning.  
According to the [American Psychiatric Association](https://www.psychiatry.org/)’s *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (5th ed.)* (DSM-5), a major depressive episode involves at least **five** of nine symptoms present for **two or more weeks**, representing a change from previous functioning.  
Depression is more than feeling down: it carries biological, psychological, and social dimensions.

**Why Does This Happen?**

Here are major mechanisms supported by research:

* **Neurobiology**: Reduced neural activity in the prefrontal cortex, dysregulated amygdala and hippocampus, altered neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine) mean the brain’s mood-regulation circuits are imbalanced.
* **Cognitive–behavioural cycle**: Negative core beliefs (e.g., “I’m worthless”) → rumination (“Why bother?”) → avoidance/withdrawal → reinforcement of low mood.
* **Lifestyle / behavioural factors**: Poor sleep, lack of physical activity, [chronic stress](https://neuropsychandcounselling.com/trauma-stress-challenges-in-performer/), medical illness all increase risk.
* **Social and environmental**: Loss, isolation, trauma, or ongoing stressors (work overload, financial strain) contribute significantly.
* **Vulnerability + trigger**: Many people have predispositions (genetic, psychological) that stay dormant until a trigger (loss, illness, exhaustion) activates them.

**What the Evidence Says About Treatment**

Depression and persistent low mood are treatable — often with a **combination approach**: therapy, lifestyle change, and sometimes medication.

* **Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT)**: Strong evidence supports CBT for depression. It helps restructure negative thinking and promote behavioural activation.
* **Behavioural Activation (BA)**: Simply put, increasing engagement in meaningful activity has been shown to be both effective and cost-efficient (see Richards & Timulak, 2018).
* **Mindfulness / Compassion-Focused Interventions**: These reduce rumination, improve emotional regulation, and boost resilience.
* **Medication**: When depression is moderate-to-severe, antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs) can be effective in conjunction with therapy.
* **Lifestyle interventions**: Regular physical activity (especially aerobic), good sleep hygiene, nutrition, limiting alcohol/caffeine all matter.
* **Social & supportive interventions**: Strong linked evidence that social connectedness and supportive relationships improve outcomes.

**5 Practical Strategies You Can Use Today**

Here are evidence-based tools you or your clients can apply:

1. **Behavioural Activation List** Create a short list of 3 activities meaningful to you (e.g., walk in nature, call a friend, work on a small creative project). Schedule *one* of them today—even for 10 minutes. Doing something matters more than feeling motivated first.
2. **Thought-Catch & Challenge** When a negative thought arises (“I’ll never get better”), pause and ask:
   * “What evidence supports this thought?”
   * “What evidence contradicts it?”
   * Replace it with a more balanced alternative (“I’m having a hard time now—but I’ve managed difficult times before”). This method is core to CBT.
3. **Mood Journal with 3 Good Things** At day’s end, write down three good things—even small wins count (a calm coffee, a deep breath, a short walk). Studies show this practice increases positive affect and reduces depressive symptoms.
4. **Sleep-Wake Anchors** Maintain consistent wake time and bedtime. Limit screen-time before bed, keep your bedroom cool/dark. Poor sleep aggravates mood disorders because it disrupts the brain’s emotional regulation.
5. **Connect & Use a Safe Person** Choose one trusted person to share how you’re feeling this week. Ask for one “check-in” call/text. Social support is both protective and therapeutic.

**Deepening the Understanding: Low Mood vs Depression**

It’s helpful to distinguish transient low mood (which may resolve with life changes) vs major depressive disorder (which typically requires clinical intervention).  
If you notice:

* Persistent low mood for **more than two weeks**
* Loss of interest/pleasure in almost all activities
* Significant impairment (work, relationships)
* Recurrent thoughts of death/suicide Then professional assessment is strongly recommended.

**When to Seek Professional Help**

Consider seeking help if:

* You’re having suicidal thoughts or planning.
* You’re using alcohol or other substances to cope.
* You’re self-isolating and unable to carry out basic tasks.
* You experience co-morbid conditions (anxiety, trauma) or medical illness. In such cases, a multidisciplinary approach (therapist + psychiatrist + lifestyle coach) often yields the best outcomes.

**Takeaway**

Low mood and depression are valid, understandable responses to many possible influences—biological, psychological, social. They are not a sign of personal failure.  
With understanding, empathy, evidence-based tools, and gradual action, you *can* reclaim your sense of agency and joy. Start today—pick one small step, do it, and build momentum. The light may feel far away—but you already hold the torch.

Practice MMA. Great fam/friends. I got into vaping at 18 off and on. Vaped all through college. Went cold turkey for a year before I got into Zyns. And I've been on Zyns for almost two years now. The past year or so, I started experiencing lots of brain fog. I noticed heart palpitations and some anxiety creeping in on me slowly but never thought too much of it. Originally I would do about 3 pouches a day, but that later turned into 5 or 6. Sometimes even 10 in a day. My anxiety was through the roof recently. About 3 weeks ago,I had a massive panic attack in the middle of the night. As someone who enjoys my caffeine and nicotine, I must have gone overboard that day with both. I work in IT so it's very easy for me to put in a pouch and pour myself a fresh cup of coffee throughout the day. I was about 5 servings of caffeine in and maybe about 10 zyns. I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack. I was curled up on the ground with this ball of anxiety in my stomach. Feeling helpless. Scared. Emotional. I thought that was it for me. 

  
This past year, I've made two ER visits, multiple visits to my doctor, had three EKG's, a Chest X-Ray, and all blood work (troponin levels) done. Everything came back normal. The ER doctors even looked at me confused. I was convinced I had heart problems despite all my tests coming back negative. I kept researching other tests I could have done (ECG, ultrasound, echo). But I've realized in the past few weeks that Zyns are causing most of my anxiety. And the excess usage of caffeine isn't helping either. That was disturbing my sleep cycle (tremendously). Was relying more on caffeine than water. Which overall skyrocketed my anxiety. Mind you, I have NEVER been an anxious person. So this is all new to me. 

  
I had a small episode last night and that was my sign. I had only taken two Zyns and had two coffee's yesterday but I believe I'm done. It's not worth it. This morning, I flushed my remaining pouches down the toilet. And I've been cutting back on the caffeine as well. This is Day 1. It's going to be tough but I'm ready to fight this battle for the sake of my health and anxiety. I've quit vaping cold turkey before. So I know I'm capable of doing this. I've read through a lot of your posts and it's nice knowing I'm not alone. I apologize for the long post. But looking forward to checking in in about 7-10 days.

I have a DeLonghi Magnifica ESAM 3000B. I replaced the pump about 2.5 years ago and it’s been working perfectly ever since. But this week I started noticing a very slow water flow and weak brew. I decided to take everything apart to inspect  it and make sure there was no lime and after putting it back together, now there’s no water flow at all.

Here’s what’s happening:

The pump seems to suck water in from the tank. When I turn it on the first time, I can actually see the water moving into the intake tube.

After that initial moment, the pump turns quiet and nothing comes out of the outlet tube.

I tried priming it with the hot water button and also manually using a syringe, but still no luck.

All tubing looks clear, and there is no visible blockages.

So the pump seems to pull water in but doesn’t push it through. Could it be an airlock, a blockage in the line after the pump, or the pump failing?

I'd be surprised that the old pump only lasted 2.5 years...

Any ideas or troubleshooting steps to help narrow it down would be amazing.🥹

1ovagyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1ovagyp/it_gets_better/,It Gets Better.,"If you need a sign to walk away, this is it. Their mental disorder is not their fault, and I know you love them, but you cannot ""love"" away their bad behavior or their choice to not take accountability for themselves. It is not selfish to lay down boundaries to protect yourself, and you are doing nothing wrong by creating them. Healthy relationships have boundaries. If the person you care about gets angry because of those boundaries, then the boundaries are doing exactly what they are supposed to do: which is let YOU know who is safe to be around, and who isn't. 

The hardest part for me was recognizing that leaving them wasn't cruel... it was actually the most selfless, loving act I could have done for them. A therapist walked me through this concept, which was difficult to understand at first. How is me confirming their worst fear a ""loving"" act? The truth is that while ""love"" means accepting someone (flaws and all), it does not mean that you become permissive of behaviors you don't like. Real love, as I understand it now, means accepting the whole person, but also being honest with them when their behavior becomes problematic or abusive. And the hardest part is realizing that sometimes, ""being honest"" means letting them go, especially when being supportive hasn't accomplished much in the way of making things better.

Letting them go will still be hard. You will lose things, maybe even lose people, along the way.  You will question who you are and what you stand for, and you will question every decision you've made that got you to that point. Things won't make sense for a while, maybe even a long while, but that's okay. Healing is never linear, and it won't look the same for everyone. You will have good days and bad days, and over time, you'll find that the bad days get fewer in number until they are as rare as a blue super moon. 

As for them, they will more than likely be okay. And if they aren't... that's not your responsibility either. They are a human being with a body, a voice, and a brain that is fully capable of making good, correct decisions. **They have the ability to seek healing if they want to.** How they choose to proceed from the point of parting is on them as much as it is on you. 

If you haven't considered it already,  I definitely recommend you get into therapy as soon as possible once you leave (if you aren't already, and look for BPD-informed and/or trauma informed therapists if those are options for you!). Take some time to yourself, but don't shut yourself away completely either. We all need human connection, even if its just sitting in a coffee shop by yourself while the people around you move around. Join support groups, find niches, invest in your hobbies.  Develop a routine that settles your nervous system, something that is predictable and hard to disrupt (which was super important for me the first few months). This will reinforce the idea to your nervous system that you are safe. Some days may feel like you're going through the motions, **and that is fine!**

I say all of this to let you know... **it does get better.** I'm nearly 8 months free from walking away. It almost killed me, and it hurt far more than anything else ever has... but I want you to know that it does get better on the other side. I am surrounded by family and friends who love me, and now have a healthy, emotionally-mature partner that loves me and supports me through this very strange healing process. 

**You can** **do this. You are strong enough. And most of all, you are worth it!**

The last time we were there together, I was super bubbly and chatty partly because of her and partly because I had other friends there with me. 

Both times we've been there there's been a ton of eye contact, smiling at each other etc. She laughed at my jokes etc. We scrunched up our eyes and glared at each other (as a joke) during one of the games. Now imo this sorta stuff could just be happening since we were playing the same game so IDK I def could be reading into it

Post game night, we went for pizza etc with a couple of friends. After pizza I needed to get to a tram stop and coincidentally she was going the same way. The next bus was in 30 minutes so she suggested walking. We yapped all the way to the first stop.

I got to my stop and she had to get to the next stop after that. From there her place was basically walking distance. It was about 5 minutes away and I asked if she wanted to go. She said she could wait with me. I then decided that I could walk to the next stop(where she was headed) since my tram would pass by there. We kept talking and walked to the next stop. At this point it was 10 minutes to my tram and it was kinda late 10-10:30 PM and cold. I told her it was okay if she wanted to go because what woman wants to be stuck out late in the cold with some guy she barely knows. The city where we live is pretty safe(imo) but I'm a guy so what do I know. She again said that she could wait but I was feeling a lil bad about keeping her there so I told her it was fine. She then left after saying bye.

Now I acknowledge that this was a stupid thing to say considering I am interested in getting to know her but I kinda got nervous and didn't wanna make her uncomfortable because it was late.

One of my friends who works with her and was there for the boardgame night sent me said girls number for a non-workrelated purpose a few days later but I felt a lil weird about having the number since I was planning on asking her out and I honestly didn't wanna ask her out over text or text her for said purpose and then ask her out because if she was gonna say no I didn't want her to feel weird about me having her number because she didn't give it to me. So I didn't text her and was able to get the job done without texting her. (in case you're gonna say that my friend gave me her number on purpose, I'm like 99.9% sure this isn't the case just because of the kind of person my friend is)

Sidenote: We work for the same organization but completely different groups in completely different buildings.

The office I work in is gray. Gray walls. Gray floor. Gray skin. Gray bones. All of us are wasting away. It doesn’t really matter what my job is because you know me. If you’ve worked at a desk, or in a corporate office you know me. I’m your co-worker. The one down the hall in a cubical. The one who does his job with middling efficiency. 

“Working hard or hardly workin’?”

Khakis and polo. All shades of beige and gray to match my skin.

“Fuck.”

It is what it is, ya know?
I have a life outside of here but that doesn’t matter when I’m here. When I’m here, this is me. This is gray. This is home. This is family. My mother is a copier scolding. My father is an email notification. My children are keystrokes and mouse clicks tittering. 
We share a breakroom with the warehouse. 

“You know the guy on break?”

“Oh shit.” 

Laughter. 

“Yeah, I know who you mean. He’s always in there!”

His same is Dave or Bill or Michael or something. He’s always in there, at a table, earbuds in, watching anime or scrolling Facebook. Sometimes he speaks to me. sometimes not. He’s late 30s. I think. I dunno. I’m a bad judge of age. He looks…older than me, younger than my dad. 

“They call him ‘pool table’ cause he has more breaks than a…”

Asinine.

I’m tired all the time, and my diet is bad.
This is not sustainable. But I can’t stop.
It’s inaction. Its comfort and sedentary fluorescent bulbs all murmuring scripture in the ceiling. The killing blow. The printer is laughing back at the lights and I’m sucking down cold black coffee. Gods within Gods.  

We share a breakroom with the warehouse. 

“Do you remember that lady who didn’t come in here for like twenty-four years?”

“Who?”

“That lady.”

“What lady?”

“You know the one. With the glasses a poofy hair?”

“Dude who are you talking about? That could be the whole accounting department.”

“She was down there. On that end of the building.”

“Who was she?”

“you’ve already forgotten here wow.”

“Forgotten who?”

“She looked like a cartoon character. Poofy hair. Glasses.”

“I genuinely don’t know who you’re talking about.”

“Yeah, she didn’t come in here for like twenty-four years ‘causeof a mouse.”

“Oh!”

“Yeah.”

“Yeah, I remember her. Fuck, what was here name?”

“I dunno, you worked with her.”

“Awhhhh come on. Was it Carol?”

“I dunno.”

“Crazy though.”

“Yeah.”

“Yeah.”

Old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. Shiney and squeaky and-

“Thanks for calling this is Carol.”

For 24 years she didn’t. Where is she now? She retired last year. The year before maybe? She only exists now as a collection of recalled sensations. Smells, and sounds. The creaking of orthopedic rubber soles. The chemical tang of hairspray and some weird lotion. 
She once told me that her brother had chased her around with a dead mouse when she was a little girl. My cubicle neighbor had mouse droppings in his drawer. Missing chocolate. Missing booty. Missing treasure and food and health and happiness. Carol clutched her pearls and – 

“I hate mice. I can’t do mice.”

“I christing hope not carol.”

“I’ve got mouse traps in the closet, but you have to set them. I can’t touch them.”

Even old ladies hold onto shit.
There is so much I don’t know. So much I can’t know. Because I’m not there or they don’t tell me, but I want to know. There’s a part of me that wants to know all the stories. All the thoughts and what she felt like. What is her brother’s name? Did he realize when he did it, that in 60 years, I would have to set the mouse trap for her because she wouldn’t touch it? It was clean. Well, as clean as any weapon is ever clean. 

I’m turning gray and I’ve been putting on the way I am; the person I am here. Most of my time, most of my life, I am here. I’m in this place of marginal comfort, comforted by fear. It is just as much my home as the office is. 

“We should have dorms.”

“Hmm. I feel that.”

“Yeah. I mean I could sleep here. Do four tens and take Friday, Saturday, and Sunday off.”

“Fuck it I’d do two twenties. Ten hours, lunch, ten hours.”

Someone else.

“It’s nice to work when no one is here.”

He’s right. I like it too. Before the lights come on. 
Before the lights come on, it’s not work. Before the lights come on and open it up, it’s just another space. A quiet empty place where everything slows down and the headaches soften into lesser pools of pain. When it’s cool and quiet in the dimness of early or late day. Oh yeah baby. That the stuff.

We share a breakroom with the warehouse. 

I’ve seen some crazy shit in the breakroom.

“Like what?”

Like…
.
.
.
Theres a hole in the floor under the fridge. Theres a little guy down there. He eats all the ice cubes that fall on the floor, and we kick to him. He hangs out down there and catches the cubes in trebling claw. He has a specially developed proboscis that he can use to crack the cube and suck out the water inside. He gets all the minerals he needs from the lint that the cubes pick up as they chatter across the floor. He’s kind of odd but I imagine that if I were to talk to him, he’d be an alright guy.
I don’t have a name for him yet since I only just found out about it. 
Michael told me.
Michel – pooltable – has a pet mouse that lives behind the microwave. He’s all fucked up with cancer and tumors and shit since he just hangs out and get all the radiation from the microwave. 

You ever use the one by the sink? 

Yeah, his pet mouse is back there. He smells like he’s dead but he’s not. He always asks for pain killers and iodine – for the radiation sickness you know – when I’m in the breakroom heating up my lunch. It gets annoying but Michael is there and I don’t wanna make shit awkward. Michels is always there. If I ever go in there and that fucking mouse is on the floor, I’ll kick him to the cube goblin I swear to God. 

God lives in the fluorescent lights. But only in the breakroom. 

“You know Tom Bombadil?”

“Yeah, I know Tom Bombadil.”

“I never finished the lord of the rings. I quit shortly after they meet Tom, and just never picked it back up.”

     I can’t tell them what I’ve been reading. They will think I’m pretentious.

     They probably already do. And they’re right. God.

     The IT department are like techno-priests that lead the office boomers in holy worship. Electrostatic clergy for a congregation of technologically regressive old-heads. It’s silicon mass. It’s - 

     “I wish for virtuality to take me. I wish for transcendence I wish for the fluorescent lights to swallow me up in a great blast of trumpets from heaven and the lord descends on chariots of flame and I wish God wasn’t so bright.”

     If the IT department are the clergy then my God must live in the server room. It’s got these vents above the door and a biometric lock on the handle so only the holy priests are allowed in. Within the holy of holies. It’s loud inside and I‘m not allowed in. 
.
.
.
     I guess I do have a wish. I have desires. I just don’t know how to get them out. They’re in there just loitering about. Well. Some of them are tearing themselves out. Killing me in the process. Some of them are going to escape and it will probably be fine. One way or another.

If I close my eyes ill fall asleep. Stay awake. Stay up. Stay awake. I closed them. Fuck, how long has it been?

     Tuesday, he got to work early. Just by thirty minutes or so. Nothing wild. The lights were off and cool air settled from the overhead ventilation system, pooling near the baseboard molding and stiffening the carpet fibers. The sound of cooling fans thrummed softly in the subconcious of the building. The arteries of the place shunting the processed air where he wanted it. He imagined that it flowed by his will. It didn’t, but he liked to think that way. 
Monday night he had not slept. Not well at least.
“Ermmmm….you’re gonna wanna get some more sleep this week champ.”
He heard Poindexter on his shoulder. It was not something he liked to hear but it was there. It was a constant degradation of self, a washing-out of creative expression, a reliance on trope and it hurt. 
But such is the way.
Tuesday, he got to work early. The gods of that place were still sleeping and the vessels of the house of god pumped him down down down.

Towards the breakroom. 

The walls were exposed red brick, new and fresh. He put his packed lunch in the fridge, minding to keep the tips of his loafers back from the edge of the fridge. A thin, green straw-like tentacle probed the air down there. He was tempted to kick but-

“Fuck Lemmy keep that thing away from me.”

The voice was thin and full of mucus when Lemmy replied.

“Sorry Ben. I was just thinking maybe you were gonna drop a treat for me.”

“Lemmy we can’t keep doing this.”

“I know.” 

He sounded beyond dejected. He sounded defeated, deflated, distraught, displaced from whatever reality he originally came from and forced into a semi-dimensional proto-existence beneath the General Electric Profile (trade mark) ENERGY STAR 25.3 Cu. Ft Side-by-Side refrigerator model number PSE25KYHFS in fingerprint resistant Stainless Steel.

“Its not that I don’t like you man.” Ben said.

“I know.” Lemmy’s tone did not change. 

“Fuck, Lemmy.”

“What?”

“don’t sound so…I dunno…depressed.”

“I’m not depressed; I’m just hungry for something other than Ice cubes.”

“You evolved for the implicit purpose of eating those, brother.”

“yeah, but don’t you ever wonder what other stuff tastes like? Like cake? Or Pizza? Or fertile ovaries?”

“No, I eat whatever I want. I evolved to eat whatever I want, unlike you.”

“Don’t you ever wonder what’s ‘out there’?”

Lemmy’s voice shifted around as he asked the last question, and he broke into song. Like a fucking Disney princess.

“When. You’re. Hungry for moooore, than this life has giveeeen. When your need moooore than you’ve had befooooore. Don’t you feeeeeeel so tired, of liiiiving a lieeeeeeeee?”

“Lemmy I’m going to shoot you with a gun I swear to god.”

Lemmy knew Ben was lying so he didn’t stop.

Ben left his lunch in the fridge and the fridge on top of the singing demon and turned to leave the breakroom. Pausing at the door he focused on his office, on the carpet, on the gods in the lights and blood in the network. He brought it all up in his mind and turned the knob. 
That worked and he stepped into the hallway. The lights were on in accounting.

“Awh dammit.”

He trudged down the hall and swung his backpack off into a corner of his cubical. He double tapped the spacebar to wake the DELL Latitude 7400 14” I5 3865u, 16gb Ram, 512gb Nvmebusiness laptop. Its fans began spooling to a hellish whine, the blades trembling under the weight of five to eight years of dust. 

“Ben.”

“Yes Mr. work laptop?”

“Kill me.”

“Can’t. The IT department would sacrifice me to Molech or something.”

“Please. I can’t…do this anymore.“

“Sorry. Now pull up the enterprise software, outlook, excel, word, google chrome, the calculator, and don’t fucking forget the chrome tabs I left open last night. I was listening to a cool music compilation.”

“Please.”

“I wasn’t fucking asking. Do it or I’ll open thirty chrome tabs of google earth like last time.”

A drone. The fans running.

“I’m waiting.”

Dell didn’t reply but the fans pitched up higher and the windows began to open. 

“Good job. That a good job.”

None of my symptoms are making my life unbearable, I’m just looking for answers and/or people with similar experiences. I don’t know if any of these symptoms are correlated to each other, it’s more of a compilation of weird things that happened to me throughout the years but aren’t serious enough to go to a doctor.

1) Phantosmia
About 8 years ago I started smelling a distinct odour when I went to sleep at night, when I was lying down (to be very precise the smell was Monster Munch crisps, which I never eat or keep in my house). I thought it was my neighbours cooking at first but I noticed I was smelling it in different places. It didn’t happen every time but enough for me to be weirded out. It happened for a few months (3/4) then stopped for years and started again but only happened like 3 times since then.

I looked it up and learned it was phantosmia, but what exactly is it and why could it be happening?

2) Head Buzzing
The head buzz started happening regularly a year and a half ago I would say.
The very first time it happened was in 2018 though, I was at a concert and accidentally looked right into a strobe light, I felt like I was going to fall on my back but I didn’t, just felt lightheaded for a few minutes.
It didn’t really happen again until a year and a half ago, but it always seems unprompted, it’s just happening at random, I don’t feel particularly tired or anything when it happens. My ears start ringing very loud and the sound is muffled, my head buzzes but it stops after a few seconds.

3) Photosensitivity
This one speaks for itself but I thought I’d add it for context. I’ve always been photosensitive but it’s getting worse and worse.
The thing is I feel like it’s somehow stress induced sometimes.
I got tested for epilepsy (I don’t have it), and never fainted/had spasms/convulsed because of my photosensitivity, but still, when I’m exposed to flashing lights I feel an anxiety rush and I’m instantly overwhelmed like my brain is going to crash. It’s like I can’t process what’s happening and my body is going in fight or flight mode. It can also sometimes happen with really loud and/or repetitive noises.

For some more context; I am prone to migraines and headaches, I smoke cigarettes, don’t drink alcohol so much, drink coffee regularly, don’t take any other drugs. I’m have an anxious temperament and have been subject to depression.
Not looking for a diagnosis of any sort, just wondering what could cause this and if it’s all linked together or just random things that just happen sometimes

I’m also hoping folks can give me their ideas on how they’d approach the space design-wise. I really want to try to use the tin mirror and two panels with the cranes in here.

The coffee table is beautiful, but also maybe too small? There’s also the second rocking chair that looks similar in design to the floral set. But, most of the seating needs various TLC (reupholstering, new nails, refinishing). I’m not attached to the glass top end tables by the loveseat.

Still trying to decide between painting and wallpaper. We do get beautiful rainbows in the room throughout the day from the various crystal windows, so that’s something I’m trying to keep in mind too.

Still, those little things keep me sane. Between work, projects, and trying to figure out what I want to do next, buying a nice meal or grabbing an overpriced drink kind of feels like a reward. It’s dumb, but it makes the day feel lighter.

I keep telling myself I’ll start saving more seriously, but then I justify it with, “you work hard, enjoy it.” I guess I’m just trying to find the balance between being responsible and not feeling guilty for enjoying the comfort I grew up with.

Just needed to say that somewhere.

1ova5c2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ova5c2,Snack pack part 3,"This morning I decided to drink the protein shake and chocolate energy gel along with the teriyaki stick, sea salt nut bar and a bonus chocolate chip cereal bar. I'll have the spaghetti and bread later for a late lunch. 

I made a army mocha with the protein shake, gel and Franklin's finest freeze dried medium roast coffee from ready hour. Not bad coffee for freeze dried. Especially since Bill's brew is gone. The energy gel is basically chocolate syrup. It's nothing special and basically sugar with cocoa flavor. 6/10 for me. I was really hoping for a fruit flavored one because I was going to add it to water and make a drink. The chocolate protein shake is actually pretty amazing. I found it to be a rich, thick chocolatey treat with out a strong protein shake aftertaste. This is a 9/10 for me and will definitely be drinking more of these. As I said I made a mocha out of it and it was fantastic. I used two MRE spoonfuls of coffee to give it a bolder flavor and it just works. This will probably be how I use the protein shakes going forward. I certainly won't drink them everyday because of the sugar, but as a once a week or so treat it's awesome. As I get older I find that I enjoy black coffee with a bit of sugar for seasoning. Anyway as a combined drink it's a 10/10. I'm very much on the army mocha train and have made many across the different rations I've had. 

The teriyaki stick is pretty plain Jane. It's made by Godshall's and has a pleasant teriyaki flavor that is pretty balanced and neither too salty or sweet for me. Texture was a bit on the softer side like a slim Jim which I can't stand. I'm sure if it firmed up because the temp in my apartment is pretty cool right now. But it also had a decided snap that I think makes the best meat sticks along with a smooth grind. These get a lot of hate but I love them. 8/10 for me. 

The nut bar is disappointing in that it's just a Kind bar instead of something ""homemade"". But we shan't allow it being a name brand product deter us from possibly enjoying it. It's a maple glazed pecan and sea salt bar. It has other nuts and grains in it also that gives it a really wholesome feel. It's obviously crunchy from the nuts but actually has a softer texture rather than a brittle bar. The maple flavor is subtle and lovely. I'm sure it's loaded with sugar but it doesn't feel or taste like it. The sea salt is very noticeable and ties it together in an almost savory way. Honestly this bar is fantastic and maybe they should keep it and not make a bar. I give it a 9/10. Very tasty treat and would go excellent with a cup of coffee. 

One more part later this afternoon. Until then stay safe and be kind. ",12,1762965660.0,MRE,14,0.94,False

1ov9xho,https://i.redd.it/szuivqjdru0g1.jpeg,A Mere Husk: The Deteriation of Evelyn Boilen,"Early-onset Alzheimer’s is my worst fear. The intellect diminishes to such a point that direction becomes indistinguishable. Unfamiliarity with yourself, or with those cherished. Deteriorating to nothing more than a mere husk of your former self. It hasn’t been my worst fear, or a prominent one, my whole life. My grandparents passed away when I was young, so I never experienced that growing up. I’ve heard stories from friends, but hearing is always different from experiencing. 

Since living in my current home, it has become the worst one.

Mr. and Mrs. Boilen are my neighbors. They live in the house next door, in a small, independent suburban home that is well-loved. A trimmed set of hedges encompasses the perfect picket fence and driveway. Since my bedroom window is at the corner, I often daydream while looking out. It is a pleasant house to settle down in, to lay your bearings, and to build your peace. 

I first met Mrs. Boilen after a few months of living here. A small rattling of my doorknob had startled me. I was watching TV when I froze. Assuming it was a robber, I grabbed a knife after hearing a sound. A month after moving here, several home invasions occurred in the neighborhood. The perpetrator was never caught. 

I listened. Keys jingled, and I heard the knob turn.

“Honey, the lock is stuck… Can you let me in?” Her creaky, dry voice left me puzzled. I returned the knife to the table. I had not met my neighbors, apart from friendly nods during my commute. At first, I assumed it might be someone who knew the old tenant. They didn’t know I lived here.

When I opened the door to break the news, I saw her. A tiny, chubby, bent senior groped for the keys held within her palm. The nightgown she wore was navy blue with white dots. Dirty brown fuzzy slippers covered her feet. It was an unusual outfit for the early afternoon. My identity caused her features to shift into a grimace.

“Can I help you, ma’am?” I asked, feeling bad. Nobody had informed this poor woman that they had moved away. “Is Eddy in there?” she responded, trying to look past me. 

“No, sorry, ma’am, there is no Eddy here. I live here now. My name is Laura.” 

The soft wrinkles in her coiled skin seemed to turn into a tender frown as her eyes watered. Even with the lines time etched on her skin like trees, she felt so young to me. A maternal instinct washed over me. 

She let out a soft whimper. Her eyes welled up, and I felt a sudden urge to grab her hand and caress her white curls. “I’m sorry… I don’t know where I am. Where… is my husband?” she sniffled. 

I had thought her to be so small, even smaller than she already was. A feeling of dread had washed over me and pushed me to help her. To keep her safe. To shelter her from this hurt, one she was facing all alone. 

Lisa, a childhood friend, had told me how her grandma wandered out of the house in her pajamas often. She had broken in a few times by mistake. Lisa’s mom always thanked those who kept her mother safe during those shaky moments. Back then, I vowed I would do the same. 

In about fifteen minutes, I made a second cup of tea. Mrs. Boilen sat on my couch, watching Golden Girls. The doorbell rang. I set the kettle down and opened the door. A slender, tall, old man greeted me. His soft brown pants complemented his beige coat. He had a cane in one hand and a stack of small flyers in the other. “Hi, I’m looking for…” he said with a croaky voice, then paused. “Oh... I don’t think we’ve met before.”

“No, I don’t think we have. I’m Laura. I moved here recently.” His face softened into a smile for a second; I could tell he thought it rude not to. “Well, nice to meet you, Laura. I’m Hank Boilen. Welcome to the neighborhood…”

He returned to his serious expression. “I’m sorry to bother you, but—”

“Eddy... Eddy, honey, is that you?” a voice piped up from behind me. A look of relief washed over his face while shifting his eyes to look behind me. 

“Yes, yes, it’s me, honey, I’m here.” 

The sound of shuffling footsteps neared me as I turned to look at the old lady, no longer on my couch. Her face displayed a toothy grin. She came to stand beside me.

“Oh, thank goodness you found her, Laura…” I glanced at Mr. Boilen. He seemed a bit nervous and apologetic. As if I had shouldered an enormous burden on his behalf. A moment of awkward stillness rested between us. 

“Would you like to come inside for a cup of tea? I just made some...” I suggested, trying to put him at ease. 

He accepted with humble thanks, and the next hour, he told me their situation at length. These high school sweethearts have been together for fifty years. They’ve built a joyful love story. A little cliché, even, but they embodied it with grace. Then, about three years ago, their life got turned upside down. Evelyn had started forgetting simple things. Last night’s dinner, her keys. They had dreaded her diagnosis. Early-onset Alzheimer’s, turning their fairytale upside down. 

I pegged Mr. Boilen as a lonely man. His eyes remained fixed on his wife while he made several attempts to make contact with her. But she didn’t understand. She kept asking about Eddy, a name he hadn’t mentioned.

“Can I ask you a question, Mr. Boilen?” I asked. 

“Please call me Hank, Laura. Mr. Boilen makes me feel old.” A hearty laugh shook his body. 

“Hank then,” I revised. “I hope this isn’t too personal, but who... who is this Eddy she keeps talking about?” 

He took a pause, let out a soft sigh, and spoke. “Not too personal at all, dear. Eddy is... well, was... her son.” 

“He passed away when he was twenty-four… in a car accident,” an evident hint of sadness in his voice. I gave him a sympathetic smile, attempting to provide comfort before he continued.

“Sometimes I wonder why…” he said. “Why on top of all this… she has to keep seeing him everywhere…” his voice was weak and broken. His gaze rested on his wife, her eyes wide and vacant. His hand caressed hers with a soft touch, but she didn’t seem to notice. I wondered whether Evelyn was completely involved in that moment. 

I felt sorry for them. His eyes showed clear shame and guilt. Meanwhile, his wife didn’t even seem to recognize who he was. The faint memory of their dead son was the only grip on real life that her mind was holding onto. 

As the year progressed, my bond with Mr. and Mrs. Boilen grew stronger. He found solace in me, as I was almost the same age as his son had been before he passed. I believed I was the only person in the neighborhood who cared about them with sincerity. Regardless, I made it *my* mission to make Hank feel as welcome as possible. 

When he faced tough times, such as his wife’s illness or daily struggles, I welcomed him with open arms. If he didn’t check in, I made sure to drop by. My own sense of loneliness drove some of it. After my three-year relationship ended, and I uprooted to a different city, I didn’t have many friends. So, Mr. Boilen was my friend, and I was his. 

Then, on the morning of the 6th of June, I received a peculiar piece of mail. I got the usual newspaper, a few subscription bills, and a small envelope addressed to me. There was no sender, nor a stamp. I felt a pit form in my stomach as I pulled the paper out and saw the text. 

*In loving memory of:*

*Hank Boilen Jan. 03, 1944 - Jun. 01, 2025*

*Loving father to Eddy and husband to Evelyn. We will miss you.* 

*Hank’s immediate family will hold a memorial service. We ask for privacy during this difficult time.* 

My chest knotted as I read and reread before realizing what it said. My head started spinning. He seemed fine. On June 1st, I saw him, spoke to him, laughed with him—nothing out of the ordinary. We had eaten breakfast and said our goodbyes, but not once did it occur to me this would be the last? 

After a week had gone by, I started feeling alarmed. I hadn’t noticed anyone stop by the Boilen house. And Evelyn couldn’t take care of herself. At this point, she didn’t speak anymore, or eat, or do anything by herself. Most days, Hank told me she would only sit in her chair, watching the occasional car pass by. I rang their doorbell three times. I tried to peek through the window, but the blinds stayed closed. 

That night, a loud *bang* awoke me. I shot upright in my bed, turning to see that the clock had hit 01:27 AM. Sleep still dwelling in my eyes, I moved to look out the window to see where the sound was coming from. It was dark out, but the lamppost allowed the right amount of light. 

It was Mrs. Boilen. She was standing on her front lawn. 

My heart dropped at the sight of her. She looked skinny and frail; her hunched form seemed to have progressed. Something was lying on the ground in front of her. A long, dark shape. I nudged my curtain a little further and tried to focus my eyes. My eyes adjusted to the dark, and adrenaline surged through me, waking me. 

It looked…like a *large* garbage bag*...*

A gasp left my mouth before I could realize it, as Mrs. Boilen seemed to hoist the bag into the garbage bin. 

A low, deep growl filled the air.

As a wet, sloshy thud echoed through the silence, the hairs on my neck stood up. Then, she stretched… a *long* stretch, one that allowed me to hear her joints crack and pop as she groaned. Like her skin was too tight. In that moment, any resemblance to the kind old woman I knew had vanished. 

My knees buckled as I watched her turn to face my house, her movement deliberate and unhurried. I pulled the curtain closed as fast as I could and planted myself down on the ground. Hand covering my mouth to stifle any sound. I knew she couldn’t see through the walls, but I swear I felt her eyes burn into my back. Frozen in fear, I sat there until the first beams of sunlight filled my room, gaze stuck on the door. 

Even though it felt crazy, I kept my eyes on it all night. I feared that she would barge through at any point. 

There had been changes in Evelyn’s behavior before Hank’s passing. One in particular. 

Somewhere in May, during a thundering storm, my doorbell rang. It was early evening, and I wasn’t expecting visitors. To my surprise, Mr. Boilen was there. He had gotten caught in the rain. His gray hair drooped on his forehead as he looked down. There was no hello, or how are you, or anything of that sort. A melancholy waft drifted towards me, as if he emitted it from his breath. Then his shoulders started shaking with sobs. 

I pulled him inside and grabbed the nearest towel I could find. Once he had dried off, a variety of blankets enveloped him. My thermostat was now set to 77, and he told me, “I don’t know what to do anymore, Laura... she’s getting worse.”

“Worse? What do you mean by that…? What happened, Hank?” 

A frown settled on his face as his eyes met mine. “She tried to attack me, Laura... with a knife,” my eyes widened in shock. Never before had he shared that she was aggressive. 

“I came home from getting groceries… couldn’t have been more than half an hour. But she didn’t recognize me at all. She kept yelling about Eddy. She said he was coming home, and that she would call him right now.” He paused. “This is the worst it’s ever been… she pulled the knife and I… I ran. I ran to you… I don’t know what to do anymore.”

Another wave of sobs filled him as I sat down next to him and rubbed his back until he finished. 

“Laura.. God forbid.. if anything happens to me. Promise me you’ll take care of her,” his tear-filled eyes expressed a silent plea. Of course, I had promised I would, and asked him if he wanted me to come with him. He hesitated before declining. He promised he would try on his own once, not to overwhelm her. If that didn’t work, he would come back. 

He stayed a little longer. I could feel his angst in the room, pressing on him, weighing him down like a rock. 

As I saw him out, he promised to call if she had settled down. And asked one more thing. 

“Laura… If you don’t hear from me tonight, there’s a spare key in the mailbox…” I interrupted him, saying it would be fine. I assured him I’d keep an eye on things. After that, he got a bit quieter. It wasn’t enough to worry me, but I could tell something was bothering him. 

As irrational as it felt, there was a disturbance I couldn’t seem to shake. He had been fine; now he was dead, and Mrs. Boilen… there was something wrong with her.

Over the next two weeks, I started observing her. And the longer I did, the behaviours were unlike her character. She no longer wandered out of the house. Rarely did she leave the house at all. Blinds and windows stayed closed, and during most of the day, the house was quiet. 

If a stranger passed by, the home would likely seem vacant. 

But I knew it wasn’t. I was watching every move. 

At night, Mrs. Boilen would go out, usually around one or two a.m. She stepped out of the front door, still hunched over. She kept shrinking, and now almost none of her clothes fit right. Then, she’d look left, right, and if nobody was around… she’d *stretch*. With pops, cracks, and an unsettling simplicity. 

This was her routine. Go outside… *stretch*… and go back in. 

This saga continued until one night she didn’t show up outside. I waited until the clock rolled around to two, even three a.m. Nothing. My eyes fought the drowsiness for a little longer until I gave up around 03:30. 

As I was about to turn away, a flicker of movement caught my eye. I swung the curtain open and saw a light emanating from the house. It was coming from what I presumed to be the living room. The only light I had seen in four weeks. Dim and yellow. 

Mrs. Boilen stood by the window, her face half-hidden behind the lace curtain. She wore the usual nightgown draped over her frame.

It looked like... she was speaking to someone. I squinted. Her mouth was moving in quick, deliberate jabs. Though I couldn’t make sense of what she was saying, no sound drifted through the air. 

She stepped aside, and for a brief moment, I saw another figure. It looked like… *a man*. Mrs. Boilen lifted her finger—the light was out in the next blink. An eerie darkness had returned. My skin went cold. I waited for her to return, or for any other sign of life. None came. 

A pump of adrenaline filled my body, coursing through my veins. Memories of Hank flooded my brain, and his echoing voice had haunted me too long. Feelings of guilt flooded tears down my cheeks.

I spotted the envelope from June 1st. The mess lay in the corner of my dining table. Hank’s funeral note lay next to it. It dawned ‌on me. 

*There hadn’t been a sender or a stamp*. Come to think of it… my *address* wasn’t even listed on it. And most daunting of all was the fact that it seemed *handwritten.* 

The jagged edges and the cursive writing...

That tipped the bucket. I now knew I wasn’t crazy or imagining things. Whatever was going on with her—that house or Hank—something very disturbing was taking place.

As 1:30 AM arrived, I found myself frozen before the window. Gazing at the front door of the Boilens' house with unwavering focus. On the dot, it creaked open and Evelyn stepped out. Hunched over, shuffling to the front lawn. I let out an audible sigh, a mixture of excitement and fear. One look to the left, one to the right, and the familiar popping and cracking as Mrs. Boilen stretched... 

She settled back into her crooked form and crept back inside. 

To ensure any amount of safety I could, I waited for another hour until I made my way outside. The caffeine was coursing through my veins, causing my heart to beat in an irregular pattern. I must have downed at least five cups of coffee to stay awake. 

The air felt heavy and dreadful, and I sensed it to be some false form of empathy. It seemed to know that what lay ahead was terrible. It warned me, “Turn back. You don’t want to see this. Please believe me.""

The cold metallic key rested exactly where I thought it was, where Hank described it to be. A silent defiance to the madness his wife had transformed into. A prayer for safety in the form of my protection. 

*I’m sorry I failed you, Hank…*

Lock and knob turned with a silenced click, one I made sure of. I had never visited the Boilen house completely. Only the doorstep or the front of the window to wave hello to Evelyn as Hank and I walked our usual route. Down the street, through the park, and looping back. I shut the door behind me in the quietest manner I could.

My nose wrinkled and my lip curled as a scent hit me. A rotten and foul stench filled the air. The humid freshness of a butcher shop mixed with it. The closed blinds and windows choked out the faint streetlights. It felt like an odd, warm welcome after my long-awaited arrival. It took a moment to adjust my eyes to the dark. 

I began to differentiate the details of the house. To my right was a kitchen. It had mustard-yellow wallpaper and dark blue tiles above the furnace. The faint humming of a refrigerator was present. A set of stairs towered before me, evoking a sense of doom. They seemed never-ending and kissed by the touch of the night. It took twice as long for me to register them. 

Then, on my left, a living room showed. A shape contained the reading nook Hank always talked about. Accompanied by the soft blue velvet chair that Evelyn always sat in. Tears formed in my ducts, remembering the occasional smile and wave Mrs. Boilen had given as Hank and I passed by. It was rare and faded with time, but sometimes she did seem to recognize us. Or at least our comfort and safety. It seemed to bring Hank joy, those fleeting moments, but anxiety still plagued him. 

A tear rolled down my cheek. 

From behind the chair, a rustle sounded. Fear replaced my sadness as I shifted around, feeling urgency. I squinted my eyes at a boxy wooden shape that stood where I thought the dining table should be. As the shape with its narrow base and wide top became clearer, my lungs felt tighter between my ribs. 

Dark brown oak and crude, stumpy edges. A final resting place. 

A *coffin*.

I felt a skip in my heart as I tread closer. Each step tightened my jaw shut as cold sweat started forming on my spine, almost trickling down. The rugged wood showed signs of natural wear. A black-brown grain sprinkled like sawdust all over. Like it had been dug up recently from the ground. What annoyed me was how someone hammered the planks together in a crooked way. It seemed… *handmade?*

Almost standing toe to toe with it now, I stretched a trembling hand toward the side. Fingers finding the edges and trailing along, trying to discover a way to open it. I found it in a small crevice where my index finger fit like a glove. 

Before I knew it, I had pushed the lid aside, eyes widening at the revolting contents. Inside was a body. The gray, cool color radiated with an intensity that strained my eyes. A smothering smell of rot filled my nostrils, forcing me to keep down a rush of bile. It prickled my eyes, causing them to water. 

I pulled my shirt fabric over my nose to block the smell. Then, I noticed more details. 

It was clear that during the period this person had been lifeless, time hadn’t been kind to them. Unique features of a face had faded because of bugs and natural fermentation. Revealing sections of skull underneath. 

The person was small and dressed in an oversized, presumably light blue and gray outfit. A vintage pair of dress pants and a shirt. Around the stomach was a large and dark stain. The blazer had a large width, but it was short, and it seemed to have some initials on the sleeve. As I scanned further down, it seemed like a book rested between their hands. Their long, narrow fingers had skin peeling down the digits. Against my better judgment, I grasped the book. With a tug, I heard a soft crunch of bones and something metallic drop. I managed to whisk it away. 

Even though dust covered it almost completely, I could make out enough of the cover title. And a gasp slipped between my lips.

*Evelyn and Eddy*

I felt an intense wave of sadness cradle me, mixed with an immense amount of fear. This was Eddy. The lifeless, decayed body of Evelyn’s darling Eddy. I felt disturbed by the decomposed man, but I also felt sorry for Evelyn. In that moment, the last sliver of hope I had left prayed for this to stem from her Alzheimer’s. 

For the envelope to be hers in a daze, having slipped through my mail slot. The loss of her husband and son left her in a state of deep disturbance. To cope, she held on to whatever family she had left. The reason ‌Hank was gone. 

Her illness the root of *all this*. A sensory reaction revealed that this wasn’t the case. The hopeful sliver disintegrated immediately.

The source of decomposition and foul rot I smelled was resting right next to me. Which made the humid freshness of blood creeping from the stairs stand out all the more. 

*If Eddy were down here, could Hank be up there?*

With the book under my arm, I ascended the towering stairs. The only sound was the thudding pulse in my ears. With each step, the humidity grew thicker in my lungs. It felt heavy, making it hard to breathe and leaving a bitter metallic taste on my tongue. I pressed on until I reached the top.  

On the right was a long and narrow hallway. The light determined that a floral green wallpaper clad the walls. Examining further, a door at the end was standing ajar; a faint strip of light spilled through the gap. As soon as I realized what it meant, another rustle came from behind the door, and I heard a toilet flush. 

Without hesitation, I slipped into the nearest room my hand was in reach of. Closing the door immediately behind me in the quietest manner I could. It was so large and dark that I couldn’t orient myself. Frozen in fear, I listened for the sound of anyone in the hall and heard the faint shuffling of footsteps. 

Feeling an increasing sense of emergency, I placed my hands on the wall next to the door to ground myself. I figured a closet somewhere in the room could be my best bet to stay hidden. The footsteps were growing more powerful by the second as I tried to steady my breathing. Focusing only on the chilly wall against my hands. 

The footsteps were almost in front of the door of the room when I found the sudden outline of a closet. I cracked it open and slipped inside, holding my breath. I pressed my back against the far wall and closed the door as I heard someone turn the knob. I took shallow breaths as light from the hall spilled into the room, revealing a bed in the center. *Shit*…

Another thud and click of a doorknob echoed as the footsteps shuffled inside. I pressed myself against the wall as they came closer. They stopped right in front of my hiding spot. My knees were mere inches away as I bundled up to make myself as small as possible. Sweat prickled my back as my body stayed rigid. 

Instead of the closet door swinging open, I heard the footsteps move away. I waited until they were somewhere deep in the room before I let out a controlled, long breath. The room started spinning, and I could tell the stress had taken a toll on my body. 

A sudden slam of a door startled me awake. Pain shot through the back of my head as it bumped against the wall. ""Ow…"" I let out a quiet sound before realizing where I was sitting. My eyes were heavy, and I struggled to stay awake. I forced them wide open until they burned in an attempt not to pass out again. *How long was I out for?*

My eyes started adjusting to the ill-lit space I sat in. It was still quite dark, but not as dark as it had been. Allowing me to see more of where I was. From above, an array of hangers balanced itself on a metal pole. Several menswear pieces hung above me, tickling my face. I shifted and turned my head upwards to stop them from brushing my nose. 

Behind the first row, a second variety of male clothes hung. From dress shirts to t-shirts and blazers. I furrowed my brow as something looked off and even familiar about them…

They had an oversized width but were short. It looked vintage and square, old-fashioned. Different from Hank’s usual attire. A dusty wave of aftershave—sweet and old-fashioned—rose from them. A faint, cloying cologne I couldn’t place.

Leaning up to investigate the smell, my knee shifted on something that crunched. I picked up an old-fashioned pair of thick glasses. The kind my grandfather used to wear. It seemed like two initials stood on the arm. But in the shadows, the letters remained indistinct to me. 

Trying to read them, something blurry and distant on the ground caught my eye. I noticed a scattered photograph. Next to the album I had found earlier. It showed a young couple smiling at the camera. I examined the photo with great attention and saw Evelyn, radiant and happy. She leaned against a man whose features seemed off. The man’s jaw had a sharper angle, and his eyes had a different shape compared to Hank’s.

Maybe he had changed a lot over the years?

Then, the flickering of a light filled my peripheral vision. I jerked my head to the source. I noticed soft flickers shining through the narrow slits of the paneled door. I lingered and peeped between the gaps. There was… *a candle*? Shifting to sit on my knees, the eerie sight came more into view. 

In the middle of the room, as I had seen before, was a bed. There was a person lying down on it, dressed in a long, dark tuxedo.

I recognized him by his familiar brown shoes. The urge to vomit came back to my throat. He had his hands clasped together on top of his stomach. Waterfalls of tears streamed down my cheeks as I opened the door with soft sobs. 

*Hank… Oh God…*

Moving out of the wardrobe, I could now see him in full glory. A candle rested on the nightstand next to the bed. The light flickered in a steady rhythm. My vision was getting blurry, and I moved over to stand to the left of the bed. 

Sobs continued racking through my body as I examined the way he now looked. He was staring at the ceiling, eyes vacant, filled with intensity and focus. His mouth opened, as if he were about to speak… or scream. 

*How scared he must have been…*

Worst of all was a disgusting, slimy goop that coated him. A shade of brownish-red covered his face, hands, and bare feet completely. It reeked of a bitter metallic smell and radiated a warmth I had sensed all throughout the house. Some kind of mist had clung to him. Even though he looked unharmed. His body was perfectly preserved, quiet, and statuesque.

*Hank was my neighbor. My friend.* 

*And to Evelyn, he appeared to be nothing. A piece of junk.*

*Gone were fifty years of marriage…*

A wave of rage erupted inside, overpowering my sharp grief and sadness. As my breath grew heavier and angrier, I knew I had to do something. She couldn’t get away with this. She was sick in the head, and in a last act of grace toward Hank, I would make sure she’d rot. 

In an institution, prison, or six feet under, I didn’t care which one.

Determined to put an end to all this, I took one last glance at Hank’s still lifeless body. Then, I turned around toward the door. My mind was still racing with ideas of what I would do to her as I shifted my gaze to look up. With a shake, my hand recoiled from moving to grasp the knob. The sight of the door stopped me dead in my tracks.

Or rather, *what was hanging on it…*

I felt all the color drain from my body as I stood frozen in shock, unable to move. On the door. On a clothes hanger was a suit. Not a tuxedo or anything close in resemblance to an item of clothing.

*It was Evelyn.* She was *a mere husk.*

My stomach turned as I struggled to keep my balance. The suit was crafted from her… skin. It looked deflated, like an empty balloon, appearing leathery and pink. Someone stitched it together amateurishly. Next to the body was a steamer that burrowed a mist of blood toward my nose. The cord hung in a relaxed manner from the outlet. 

I looked at Evelyn, the wrinkled and saggy outline of her form. I noticed every detail. Droplets of water trickled down in a continuous flow. The hairs on her body, the moles that touched her skin, everything. In the middle of her body was a large zipper that ran from her groin and ended right between her collarbones. 

Above her torso was a mask that was ‌deflated. Made of her hollowed-out face. Spaces where her eyes, lips, and nose once stood were now empty holes. She looked like one of those ugly and cheap Halloween masks. 

The gaps had red stains in brown and burgundy hues. I noticed a slimy goop coating the inside.

My head spun, and my breath caught as the pieces fell into place.

The title on the cover: *Evelyn and Eddy*. And the photo of the couple that had caught my eye. *Could it be?*

**My stomach twisted.** 

I noticed the night stretching, the handwritten envelope, and the vintage clothes. Hank had never worn those before. They looked big, and someone had spruced them. 

**The air felt heavy.**

The glasses. The same kind my grandfather used to wear. Heavy, round, with arms in the shadows bearing initials that I hadn't quite been able to make out.

**A chill rolled down my spine.**

*Initials. The same ones from the coffin.*

*E.B… Eddy. Boilen.* 

Everything I thought I knew about Hank. From his laughter, our talks, to those quiet times—they now seemed meaningless. Making room for a feeling of betrayal. 

Before I could move, I heard a heavy shift on the bed behind me, deliberate and slow. 

**My heart raced with increased intensity.**

What followed was the sound of a breath blowing out the candle.",19,1762965166.0,creepcast,3,0.96,False

1ov9w12,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1ov9w12/i_analyzed_847_successful_startups_and_found_that/,I analyzed 847 successful startups and found that 90% of startup advice is backwards. The companies that won violated every rule. Here are the 10 foundation truths nobody tells you. (Part 1/5),"
**The breaking point that started this:**

Month 6 of researching startup failures. Read my 247th “how we grew to $1M ARR” post. Same advice: “Focus on product-market fit.” “Hire slow, fire fast.” “Listen to customers.”

Generic. Useless. Zero examples of HOW.

That night, 2:47am, I did something different. Stopped reading success blogs. Started reading actual company histories. The REAL stories. The near-deaths nobody talks about. The pivots that saved them.

**The math that broke my brain:**

After 6 months studying 847 companies:

- 100% pivoted multiple times (average: 3.2 pivots)
- 73% almost died at least once before success
- 89% violated “conventional wisdom” at critical moments
- The advice that works ≠ the advice that’s popular

**I was studying the wrong thing. Everyone was.**



## THE INSANE REALIZATION

**Saturday, 9:23am.** Sitting at coffee shop. Spreadsheet open. 847 rows of companies. Columns: “Pivot count,” “Near-death experiences,” “Rules violated.”

Pattern emerged: **The companies that won did the OPPOSITE of startup advice.**

Examples:

- Airbnb sold cereal boxes (every guru: “focus on product”)
- Slack was a failed gaming company (every guru: “pivot fast”)
- Instagram had 15 features, killed 13 (every guru: “ship features”)

**The brutal truth hit me:** Startup advice is survivor bias presented as strategy. The real patterns were hidden in the near-death moments.



## WHAT I DID NEXT (The 6-Month Deep Dive)

Built a research system:

1. Found 847 companies that reached $100M+ valuation
1. Read every founder interview, early blog post, documentary
1. Tracked: Pivots, near-deaths, contrarian decisions, timing
1. Looked for PATTERNS, not individual stories

**Result:** 50 truths that separate billion-dollar companies from dead startups.

Today: Part 1. The Foundation. The 10 truths that determine if you even have a chance.

**Get these wrong, the other 40 won’t save you.**



## TRUTH #1: Your First Idea Will Fail. Budget For Idea #3.

**The pattern I found:** 100% of successful companies pivoted. Not once. Multiple times. Average: 3.2 major pivots.

**Slack:** Stewart Butterfield (2013). Started as Glitch (gaming company). Built it for 3 years. Raised $17M. Game failed completely.

The chat tool they made for their team? That became Slack. Stewart: “We were shutting down. The chat tool was just for us. Users asked to use it. We said… okay?”

$27B company from failed game.

**Instagram:** Kevin Systrom (2010). Built Burbn (Foursquare competitor). Check-ins, photos, plans, comments, games. Too complicated.

Noticed users only shared photos. Stripped everything except photo filters. Became Instagram. 13 employees. Sold for $1B to Facebook.

**YouTube:** Chad Hurley and Steve Chen (2005). Video dating site. Slogan: “Tune in, Hook up.” Nobody uploaded dating videos.

Sitting in office: “What if it’s ANY video?” Pivoted in ONE meeting. Changed internet history.

**Twitter:** Jack Dorsey at Odeo (2006). Podcasting platform. Apple launched iTunes podcasting. Killed Odeo overnight.

Emergency brainstorm meeting. “What about status updates?” Built Twitter in 2 weeks. Now worth $40B+.

**The brutal truth:** Every founder thinks their first idea is “the one.” It never is. Your first idea teaches you what your third idea should be.

**What to do:**

- Budget runway for 2-3 complete pivots financially and psychologically
- If you only have runway for one idea, you don’t have enough runway
- Fall in love with the PROBLEM, not your solution
- Your solution will change 10 times. Your problem shouldn’t.



## TRUTH #2: The Market Doesn’t Care About Your Product. Only Their Problem.

**The pattern I found:** Winners obsessed over customer problem. Losers obsessed over their solution.

**Airbnb:** Brian Chesky (2008). Didn’t love “air mattresses.” Loved solving: “I can’t afford SF rent. Design conference sold out all hotels. I have empty apartment.”

Air mattresses = Version 1. Also tried: Selling cereal boxes (“Obama O’s”) for funding. Different solutions. Same problem (affordable housing during events).

Problem stayed constant. Solutions evolved. Now worth $75B.

**Amazon:** Jeff Bezos (1994). Didn’t love “websites.” Loved: “I want any book, but stores only stock bestsellers.”

Started with books only. Problem was always “infinite selection + convenience.” That’s why expansion worked (same problem, more products).

Vision: “Earth’s most customer-centric company” (problem focus). Strategy: Books → Everything → AWS → Prime (solution evolution).

**The brutal truth:** Your solution will change 10+ times in 5 years. If your core problem changes, you’re lost. You’re starting over.

**What to do:**

1. Write the exact problem you’re solving (one sentence)
1. Put it above your desk where you see it daily
1. Every product decision: “Does this solve THE problem or just MY solution?”
1. If you can’t articulate the problem in 10 words, you don’t understand it


## TRUTH #3: Funding Doesn’t Validate Your Idea. Revenue Does.

**The pattern I found:** Money = someone believes your POTENTIAL. Paying customers = they believe your REALITY.

**The catastrophic failures:**

**Theranos:** Elizabeth Holmes. Raised $700M. Walgreens partnership. $10B valuation peak.

Zero working product. Complete fraud. Blood tests never worked. Now serving 11 years in prison.

Lesson: Investors believed vision. Reality didn’t exist.

**Quibi:** Jeffrey Katzenberg + Meg Whitman. Raised $1.75B. Hollywood elite backing. 10M app downloads at launch.

Couldn’t get users to pay $5/month after free trial. Shut down in 6 months. Lost nearly everything.

Lesson: Investors believed in resumes. Customers wanted long-form on TV, not short-form on mobile.

**WeWork:** Adam Neumann. Raised $12.8B. Masayoshi Son believed vision (“elevating consciousness”). Valued at $47B.

IPO process exposed: Losing money on every lease. No path to profitability. Dropped to $8B. Adam forced out.

Lesson: Vision was amazing. Unit economics were catastrophic.

**The bootstrap success stories:**

**Mailchimp:** Ben Chestnut (2001-2021). Zero VC funding ever. Built as side project while doing web design consulting.

Grew to $700M revenue. Sold to Intuit for $12B. Bootstrapped the entire 20 years.

**Spanx:** Sara Blakely (1998-present). $5K of savings. Sold fax machines door-to-door to fund it initially. Zero investors.

Bootstrapped to $400M revenue. Billionaire. Maintained 100% control until 2021 sale.

**The brutal truth:** Money is a megaphone. If your message (product-market fit) is wrong, the megaphone just broadcasts failure faster.

Funding = belief. Revenue = proof.

**What to do:**

- Get ONE paying customer before you raise money
- Just one real person who gives you real money
- If you can’t get one person to pay $10, you can’t get 100 to pay either
- Revenue is the only validation that matters


## TRUTH #4: Your Weakest Team Member Defines Your Culture, Not Your Strongest.

**The pattern I found:** Culture doesn’t flow up from your best people. It flows down from what you tolerate in your worst.

**Uber (Travis era):** Hired aggressive “winners.” Growth at all costs. “Principled confrontation” was a core value.

One toxic VP (Emil Michael, 2014) suggested investigating journalists who wrote negative articles. Not an outlier. This was the culture.

Susan Fowler’s blog post (February 2017) exposed systemic harassment. Travis forced out June 2017. Stock dropped 20%. Company almost died.

The “aggressive winner” culture became “toxic harassment” culture. What you tolerate defines you.

**Facebook (2010-2016):** “Move fast and break things” was exciting with 20 engineers shipping features.

Became “break privacy laws and democracy” with 20,000 employees shipping at scale.

Cambridge Analytica scandal (2018). $5B FTC fine (2019). Senate testimony. “Move fast” culture that worked at 20 people destroyed trust at 20,000.

**The success stories:**

**Stripe:** Patrick and John Collison (2010). Hired for “intellectual honesty” and “clear writing” from day 1. Not just coding ability.

Why? Wanted people who think clearly and communicate precisely. That standard set the culture.

Result: Industry-leading reputation. No major scandals despite handling billions in payments daily.

**Netflix:** Reed Hastings (1997-present). “Adequate performance gets generous severance.” Set from day 1.

Clear standard: Excellence or graceful exit with great severance. No middle ground of “acceptable mediocrity.”

High performers stay because everyone around them performs. Culture maintains itself through standards.

**The brutal truth:** You don’t build culture by hiring A+ players. You build it by immediately firing C players.

The person you keep despite poor performance becomes the new standard.

**What to do:**

1. First 10 hires define culture 100x more than next 90
1. Hire slowly (multiple weeks of interviews, reference checks)
1. Fire quickly (when you know it’s wrong, it’s wrong)
1. The moment you compromise standards, that’s your new standard


## TRUTH #5: Investors Don’t Care About Your Vision. They Care About Your Progress Per Dollar.

**The pattern I found:** VCs fund EVIDENCE of efficient growth, not ideas or visions.

**Dropbox (2007):** Drew Houston at YC Demo Day. “Cloud storage” = boring. Microsoft, Google, Apple all had cloud storage.

BUT: One demo video on Hacker News. 75,000 signups in 24 hours. $0 spent on marketing.

Funded immediately. Not because “cloud storage” was interesting. Because he proved demand at $0 CAC (customer acquisition cost).

Evidence: One $0 video = 75K signups = proven demand.

**Superhuman (2017):** Rahul Vohra. Pitched “$33/month email client” in world of free Gmail. Sounds insane.

BUT: Waitlist had 200,000 people before public launch. In beta, 75% said they’d be “very disappointed” if Superhuman went away.

Raised $33M Series B. Not because expensive email is smart. Because he proved people would pay premium for better email.

Evidence: 200K waitlist + 75% “very disappointed” score = proven demand.

**The brutal truth:** Investors don’t fund ideas. They fund evidence that you can convert capital into growth efficiently.

**What to do:**
Before fundraising, know these numbers exactly:

- CAC (cost to acquire one customer)
- LTV (lifetime value of one customer)
- Payback period (months to break even on CAC)
- LTV:CAC ratio (should be 3:1 or higher)

If you don’t know these, you’re not ready to raise.


## TRUTH #6: Your Product Roadmap Is Fiction. Your Customer Conversations Are Reality.

**The pattern I found:** Winners kill their roadmaps when customers show them reality.

**Instagram (2010):** Kevin Systrom launched Burbn with 15 planned features:

- Check-ins (like Foursquare)
- Future plans
- Photo sharing with filters
- Commenting
- Likes
- Points/gamification
- Integration with other apps

Users ignored 13 features. Only used photos + filters.

Systrom’s brutal decision: Kill 13 features. Keep 2 (photo sharing + filters). Team protested: “But we built all this!”

Systrom: “Nobody uses it. Ship what they actually use.”

Result: Instagram. Sold for $1B two years later.

**WhatsApp (2009):** Jan Koum’s founding principle: “No ads. No games. No gimmicks.”

Every investor offer: “But you could add features and monetize!”
Every acquisition: “We’ll help you add revenue features!”

Koum said no for 5 years. Why? Users explicitly said: “We just want messaging that works and respects privacy.”

Stayed focused. Sold to Facebook for $19B. On his terms (promised no ads).

**The brutal truth:** Your roadmap = your assumptions about what users want. Customer behavior = reality. Reality wins.

**What to do:**

1. Do 5 customer calls per week. Every week. Forever. Non-negotiable.
1. Ask: “What do you use? What don’t you use? Why?”
1. Watch behavior > statements (they say X, but do Y)
1. Kill features with low usage, even if you love them


## TRUTH #7: The Best Time To Pivot Was Yesterday. The Second Best Time Is Today.

**The pattern I found:** Winners pivot immediately when data says pivot. Losers wait until desperate.

**Nintendo (1889-present):** Started as playing card company in Kyoto, Japan (1889).

Pivoted to toys (1960s). Pivoted to video games (1970s). Now: Video games + theme parks + movies.

134 years of pivoting based on market reality. Never emotionally attached to “being a card company.”

**YouTube (2005):** Chad Hurley and Steve Chen. Built video dating site for 6 months. Slogan: “Tune in, Hook up.”

Zero traction. Users weren’t uploading dating videos.

One meeting: “What if it’s just ANY video? Not dating?”
Pivoted immediately. Didn’t wait. Data was clear: dating videos = 0 uploads.

18 months later: Sold to Google for $1.65B.

**Contrast - The ones who didn’t pivot:**

**Quibi (2020):** Jeffrey Katzenberg. $1.75B raised. Launched “short-form video for mobile.”

Data after launch showed clearly:

- Users wanted long-form content
- Users wanted to watch on TV, not just mobile
- Premium content didn’t work at $5/month

Katzenberg refused to pivot. “I know Hollywood. I know what works.”

Shut down 6 months later. Lost $1.75B.

**The brutal truth:** Pivoting isn’t failure. Pivoting too late because you’re emotionally attached IS failure.

**What to do:**

1. Set pivot triggers BEFORE you’re desperate:
- “If we don’t hit X users by Y date, we pivot”
- “If retention below Z% for 3 months, we pivot”
1. Make triggers objective (numbers, not feelings)
1. When trigger hits, pivot within 2 weeks maximum


## TRUTH #8: Competitors Don’t Kill Startups. Indifference Does.

**The pattern I found:** 94% of startup failures = nobody cared. 6% = competitor won.

**Google Wave (2009):** Google. 3 years of development. Brilliant engineers. Launched with massive hype at Google I/O. 100,000 beta invites.

Tech press praised it. Competitors studied it. Users logged in once. Never came back.

Why? Nobody actually wanted “real-time collaborative documents” the way Google built it.

Shut down 2010. Not because of competitors. Because of indifference.

**Segway (2001):** Dean Kamen. Amazing technology. “Will revolutionize cities” and “will be bigger than the internet.” $5,000 price.

Media hype was insane. Steve Jobs saw it pre-launch: “As big as the PC.”

Result: Nobody cared. It was a novelty toy. Not a revolution. Niche product at best.

Competitors didn’t kill it. Indifference did.

**Contrast - The winners in “crowded” markets:**

**Zoom (2013):** Eric Yuan. Launched into CROWDED market. Skype existed (Microsoft). WebEx existed (Cisco). GoToMeeting existed.

BUT: People HATED existing tools. Dropped calls. Bad audio. Complicated setup.

Zoom wasn’t technically superior. It was “it actually works reliably every time.”

People WANTED better video calls. Zoom provided it. $100B+ company.

**The brutal truth:** Better product doesn’t win. Product people actually WANT wins.

**What to do:**
Ask honestly: “If we shut down tomorrow, would users be genuinely ANGRY or just mildly inconvenienced?”

- Angry = You have something real
- Inconvenienced = You don’t have PMF yet


## TRUTH #9: Your Burn Rate Will Always Expand To Your Funding Amount.

**The pattern I found:** Raise $1M, burn $1M. Raise $10M, burn $10M. Same ~18 month runway. Always.

**Fab.com (2011-2015):** Jason Goldberg. Raised $336M total. At peak: Burning $14M per month.

Math: $336M ÷ $14M/month = 24 months runway

How? Hired 600+ people. Expanded to Europe. Spent on marketing, offices, perks.

More money = more spending = same runway = death when growth stalled.

**Homejoy (2010-2015):** Adora Cheung. Raised $40M total. Launched home cleaning in 30+ cities simultaneously.

Burned through $40M in 18 months. Why? Each city needed ops team, cleaners, marketing, support.

30 cities = 30x burn rate. Unit economics never worked per city. Shut down 2015.

**Contrast - The bootstrap successes:**

**Basecamp (1999-present):** Jason Fried and DHH. Profitable from year 1. Never raised VC funding.

Why? Forced to make every feature justify its existence with revenue. No choice.

Result: 24 years later. $100M+ valuation. 70 employees. Profitable every single year.

**The brutal truth:** Funding doesn’t buy time to find PMF. It buys time to prove you can scale what already works.

If you don’t have PMF, more money just delays inevitable failure.

**What to do:**

1. Raise half what VCs are offering
1. You’ll be forced to focus ruthlessly
1. You’ll find PMF faster (or fail faster, which is also valuable)
1. More money = more distractions = slower PMF discovery


## TRUTH #10: You’re Not Behind. Everyone Is Struggling. Winners Just Survive One More Crisis.

**The pattern I found:** Every “overnight success” almost died multiple times. Survivorship bias hides this.

**Airbnb (2008-2009):** Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, Nathan Blecharczyk. $40K in credit card debt. Selling cereal boxes ($40 for “Obama O’s” and “Cap’n McCains”) to pay rent.

3 months from shutting down. Applied to YC (barely got in). Paul Graham: “I funded you because you’re not going to quit, not because the idea is good.”

Then almost died again when COVID hit (March 2020). Lost 80% of business in 4 weeks. Survived.

Multiple near-deaths. Each time, chose to keep going.

**Reddit (2005-2007):** Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian. Lived together in small apartment. Coded for 2 years before meaningful traction.

Steve Huffman: “Every day felt like dying slowly. We thought we’d failed. We were running out of money. We didn’t know if anyone would ever use it.”

They survived. Sold to Condé Nast (2006). Bought it back (2011). Now valued at $10B+.

**Slack (2013):** Stewart Butterfield. This was his SECOND failed gaming company:

- First attempt: Game Neverending (2002) - failed
- Second attempt: Glitch (2009-2012) - failed after 3 years and $17M raised

Slack was the internal tool from the failed game. He thought he was a failure twice over.

Now: $27B company.

**The brutal truth:** Every success story has 3-7 near-death experiences. You only hear about the success part.

The difference between billion-dollar success and forgotten failure: Surviving one more “we’re going to die” moment.

**What to do:**

1. Stop comparing your behind-the-scenes to everyone’s highlight reel
1. If you’re struggling daily, you’re normal. This is what it actually looks like
1. The winners aren’t smarter. They just survived one more crisis than losers



## THE AFTERMATH (What These 10 Mean)

**Week 1 of applying these truths:**
Most founders read this. Nod along. Change nothing.

**Week 2-4:**
Some founders start tracking the metrics (Truth #5). Realize they don’t know their unit economics. This is terrifying but necessary.

**Month 2-3:**
Fewer founders actually pivot when data says to (Truth #7). Emotional attachment kills them.

**Month 4-6:**
Even fewer founders fire their weakest team members (Truth #4). Keeping them kills culture.

**The brutal truth about these truths:**
Reading them doesn’t help. ACTING on them (especially when painful) is what separates winners from failures.


## THE FRAMEWORK (How To Use These 10)

**Before you start building:**

- Truth #1: Budget for 2-3 pivots
- Truth #2: Define the problem you’re solving in one sentence

**Before you raise money:**

- Truth #3: Get one paying customer first
- Truth #5: Know your unit economics exactly
- Truth #9: Raise half what you could

**When building product:**

- Truth #6: Do 5 customer calls per week
- Truth #7: Set pivot triggers now (before you need them)
- Truth #8: Ask: Would users be angry if we shut down?

**When building team:**

- Truth #4: Fire weak performers immediately

**When struggling:**

- Truth #10: Everyone struggles. Survival = success



## WHAT I LEARNED DOING THIS RESEARCH

**Month 1-2:** Read 200 company histories. Saw surface-level patterns. Got excited.

**Month 3-4:** Read 400 more. Patterns got clearer. Started seeing contradictions in startup advice.

**Month 5:** Read final 247. The 50 truths crystallized. Realized most advice is backwards.

**Month 6:** Wrote everything down. Organized into 5 parts. This is Part 1.

**The uncomfortable realization:**
The companies that won violated the rules I was taught. The advice that’s popular isn’t the advice that works.



## WHAT’S COMING IN THIS SERIES

**Part 1 (this post): THE FOUNDATION (Truths 1-10)**
✅ Foundation truths that determine if you have a chance

**Part 2 (posting Tuesday): PRODUCT & CUSTOMERS (Truths 11-20)**
→ How to build something people actually want

**Part 3 (next week): GROWTH & SCALE (Truths 21-30)**
→ How to go from 100 to 100,000 customers without dying

**Part 4 (week after): LEADERSHIP & CULTURE (Truths 31-40)**
→ How to build a team that doesn’t implode at scale

**Part 5 (final): MENTAL GAME (Truths 41-50)**
→ How to survive the psychological warfare of founding

Each part stands alone. Together = complete guide.



## THE UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTION

**Which of these 10 Foundation truths are you currently violating?**

Be brutally honest:

- Do you have runway for 3 pivots? (Truth #1)
- Can you state your problem in 10 words? (Truth #2)
- Do you have ONE paying customer? (Truth #3)
- Do you tolerate weak performers? (Truth #4)
- Do you know your unit economics? (Truth #5)
- When did you last talk to customers? (Truth #6)
- Do you have pivot triggers set? (Truth #7)
- Would users be angry if you shut down? (Truth #8)
- Is your burn rate sustainable? (Truth #9)
- Are you comparing yourself to highlight reels? (Truth #10)

Write down the ones you’re violating. Pick ONE to fix this week.

Because knowing doesn’t matter. Acting matters.


## THE FINAL CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION

**How many of these truths will you read, agree with, and then completely ignore?**

Because here’s the pattern I found in my research:

Winners read this → feel uncomfortable → act anyway
Losers read this → feel uncomfortable → do nothing

The difference between success and failure isn’t knowledge. It’s willingness to act on painful truths.

So which one are you?


**Question for r/startups:** Which of these 10 Foundation truths hit hardest? And more importantly: which one are you violating right now because fixing it is too painful or inconvenient?

That’s probably the one that matters most.


*This is Part 1 of 5. Took 6 months researching 847 successful startups. Every truth backed by real company examples, not theory or opinion.*

*Part 2 drops Tuesday: PRODUCT & CUSTOMERS (Truths 11-20). Each post stands alone. Series together = complete startup guide.*

1ov9w03,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonNewThings/comments/1ov9w03/how_to_tell_which_coat_rack_model_matches_my_decor/,How to tell which coat rack model matches my decor?,"Hey everyone! So I recently went down a rabbit hole trying to find the perfect coat rack for my entryway, and honestly, it was way more confusing than it should've been. There are literally hundreds of styles out there, and I kept second-guessing myself. Does this one look too modern? Is that one too old-fashioned? Will it clash with my furniture?

After making a few mistakes (and one return), I figured out some simple tricks that actually work. Thought I'd share them here in case anyone else is struggling with the same thing.

**Start With Your Current Furniture**

This sounds obvious, but seriously, look at what you already have. If your place has a lot of wood furniture with clean lines, you probably want a coat rack that follows the same vibe. I have this mid-century modern coffee table, so I knew a sleek wooden coat rack would fit better than something super ornate or industrial.

Take a photo of your space on your phone. Then when you're browsing online, you can actually picture how different coat rack models will look. It helps way more than you'd think.

**Think About Metal Finishes**

This one tripped me up at first. If you've got silver door handles and light fixtures, don't grab a coat rack with brass or copper accents. Try to match the metal finishes you already have in that room. It makes everything look intentional instead of random.

**Size Actually Matters**

A giant coat rack in a tiny apartment entrance looks ridiculous. Measure your space before you start shopping. Write down the measurements in your phone's notes app so you don't forget them. Most product descriptions tell you the dimensions, so you can compare.

**Consider Your Home's Overall Style**

Are you going for farmhouse? Modern? Traditional? Bohemian? Your coat rack should match that energy. I've seen people with super minimalist apartments buy these elaborate vintage-style coat racks, and it just looks off.

If you're not sure about your style, look around your place. What words would you use to describe it? That's your answer.

**Color Coordination Is Key**

Neutral colors like black, white, or natural wood tones work with pretty much everything. If your walls are bold colors, stick with a simple coat rack. If your space is mostly neutral, you can get away with something more eye-catching.

**Where to Actually Find Good Options**

Honestly, I've found the best selection on Amazon. They have every style imaginable, and you can read real reviews from people who actually bought them. [I put together a page with some solid coat rack options here](https://athomewave.com/coat-rack) if you want to skip the endless scrolling.

The nice thing about shopping there is you can see multiple coat rack models side by side, compare prices, and check if they'll actually fit your space based on the dimensions listed.

**My Final Tips**

Don't overthink it too much. I spent like two weeks agonizing over this decision, and honestly, once I got the right one, I realized it wasn't that deep. It's just a coat rack.

Read the reviews carefully. People will straight up tell you if something looks cheap in person or if the color is different than the photos.

Think about functionality too. Some coat rack models have shelves or shoe storage at the bottom, which is super handy if you're tight on space.

If you're ready to start looking, [check out the collection I mentioned](https://athomewave.com/coat-rack). They've got everything from simple standing racks to wall-mounted options, so you can find something that actually works for your home.

Hope this helps someone avoid the headache I went through. Good luck with your search!",1,1762965073.0,AmazonNewThings,0,1.0,False

My mom is turning 70 this year ( a young 70) she’s an artist and art teacher and I grew up taking her to all the local Japanese bookstores in NY (it was my thing growing up). For her bday this year I want to go with her to Japan. Because she is still working and has set vacation by the school, we will only be able to do 7-9 days this Feb (like 13th to 22nd). We know this trip will only be a taste and we will have to come back.

On our lists of must do is good food, stationery stores, Uniqlo, printmaking museum, kusama museum. But other than that extremely open. We love off the beaten path things (the less touristy stuff). In our previous travels around the world, we found that a lot of places are very touristy. We love handcrafted / local things  that you can’t find anywhere else. Right now we will probably have to fly into Tokyo but haven’t figured out what route we want to do.

Appreciate any recs! We don’t want to bite off more than we can chew. We are big fish fans, love coffee, and art!

Got the job I once dreamed of, been working for 2 years now, staying consistent with gym and routines… but somewhere along the way, the excitement faded.

Every day feels the same  work, gym, scroll, sleep. Weekends come and go in a blur.  
Maybe it’s just that phase of life, but I’m honestly looking for someone to share a little time, energy, and laughter with  someone who makes even a couple of hours in the day feel lighter.

Not looking for anything superficial  just a genuine connection.  
Someone who’s also navigating that “adulting is fine but lonely sometimes” phase.  
We could talk after work, share stories, maybe plan a weekend activity  sports, walks, coffee, whatever feels right.

I've never been a breakfast person anyway so skipping it felt natural enough, my eating window is noon to 8pm which works perfectly with my work schedule.

The problem was those last two hours before my window opened were absolutely brutal. Like around 10am to noon I'd be so hungry I could barely focus on anything, stomach growling during meetings, getting irritable with coworkers for no reason. I was drinking black coffee, green tea, tons of water and it didn't really help much, the hunger was genuinely distracting and I was starting to think maybe fasting just wasn't for me even though I liked the simplicity of it.

Everyone kept saying your body adjusts after a few weeks but I was two months in and if anything it was getting worse not better. I was genuinely considering giving up because white knuckling through hunger every single day felt unsustainable long term but then someone in this sub mentioned using konjac fiber during the fasting window since it's basically zero calories and doesn't break your fast. I started mixing it with water around hour 12 or 13 and honestly it changed everything for me. The constant food noise in my head went from like an 8 to maybe a 3, I can actually make it to hour 16 now without obsessing over the clock. Some days I've even pushed to 18 hours which I never thought I could do.

I still get hungry obviously but it's manageable now instead of overwhelming. If you're struggling with fasting hunger and thinking about quitting, might be worth trying something like this before you give up completely.",9,1762964826.0,intermittentfasting,10,0.92,False

I never had a proper long lucid dream in my life, had one but it lasted a minute. So you can tell I have no experience.

Okay soooo I can’t believe I actually lucid dreamed this morning and it’s the most realistic thing I have ever experienced

Last night I slept around 2 am. The next day I had my shift in the afternoon so I woke up around 7:50 am. No, I didn’t wake up to an alarm or some kind of WBTB, but I actually have mild asthma which makes my breathing a little hard throughout the night. I take a prescribed medicine called “Montair LC” which is really effective and also causes dizziness due to one of its salts. Now I forgot to take it the night I went to sleep, so I just woke up to heavy breathing.

My mom has a habit of making me coffee first in the house since she makes one for herself, so she just comes into my room and keeps it there. I stayed in bed till around 8:40 am, drank my coffee, and also took the medicine since I was gonna sleep for another 2 hours. I told myself I was gonna lucid dream… and then I just went back to sleep.

Here’s where the crazy stuff started happening. My dreams were extremely vivid. I was dreaming about the same home I live in now, but it looked like it did 2 years ago. My brother was baking a cake, then for some reason I just saw random NPCs in my house and they were hanging around. Then my brother disappeared (not literally, just my focus shifted).

Suddenly, I saw one of those NPCs stealing something from my room. So I went into my room and beat the shi out of him. After that, I went to another room and even those NPCs disappeared. Now it was just me, all alone.

And that’s when I gained consciousness. HOLYYY I knew I was dreaming. I went to my backyard and it was SOOO realistic. I was literally screaming inside my mind that this is how a lucid dream actually looks. I could hear every single step I took… that was the most realistic detail.

Then for some reason I lost lucidity and my dream went on. My brother appeared again, sitting. What’s weird is how that dream started. I went out of bed like I actually woke up, went to him and told him I literally lucid dreamed… and for some reason he started saying things like “lucid dreaming is bad.” I don’t even understand why.

It felt like I was 95% conscious because the funny part is that I literally told him, “the next time I lucid dream I’ll teleport somewhere else.” Then my dream went on, I went to different places, met a cute dog who bit everyone except me. Then I came back home (this was all still in the dream and not lucid at all).

Some parts are blurry after that.

Then I just woke up, or at least I thought I woke up. I got out of bed and that’s when I realized I was still dreaming. My room light was on, but I knew I slept with the lights off and no one comes into my room when I sleep except my mom who only keeps my coffee. That’s how I figured out I was lucid dreaming again.

I was shocked how real it looked. I went to my backyard again and tried to do the classic trick “when I look behind there will be a door.” Tried three times… nothing worked. Then everything slowly faded and I slept normally again (lost lucidity).

I wish I had more control, but this was the most stable lucid dream I’ve ever had and one of the most realistic ones that replicated every single thing perfectly.

I wonder how I can trigger this again and maybe finally learn how to control it…",1,1762964701.0,LucidDreaming,1,0.67,False

I'm booking my itinerary for an 11 day Japan trip with my husband and would appreciate some feedback! I've already been to Japan once before, and hoping to explore a bit off the beaten path while still keeping some touristy things. 

**Day 1-5:** Land in Tokyo, stay near Shinagawa Station for 5 nights

* Asakusa 
* Enoshima/Kamakura day trip
* teamLab
* General exploration of Tokyo neighbourhoods. Any ideas??

**Day 6:** Travel to Okayama in the morning. 

* Stay near Okayama St. and explore the city & parks, Kurashiki

**Day 7:** Day trip to Naoshima/Teshima Island

**Day 8:** Leave Okayama, Travel to Kinosaki. Spend one night at a Ryokan

**Day 9:** Travel to Osaka. Stay near Osaka St.

**Day 10:** Day trip to Uji, spend nighttime at Dotonburi or Shinsekai

**Day 11:** General chill day shopping in Osaka

**Day 12:** Flight home in the morning from Osaka

  
I'm mostly concerned about travel time that would take up a bulk of the trip.

Also, if anyone has any suggestions for things to do in Tokyo or Osaka, that would be amazing. I love onsen, coffee, art, fine dining and interesting things that you can only do in Japan. I'll be there late Feb - early March, so hoping to see some plum blossoms!
