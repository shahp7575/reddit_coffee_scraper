He barely sees friends tho and when I'm at work or busy and tell him ""ask x or y, they always want to hangout with you"" he answers with ""no.... don't feel like it/we don't have much in common"" which I get it, but still don't complain then, what do you want from me?!

1ky5arb,https://i.redd.it/nzk742yqio3f1.png,Heather and her coffee shop synth technique (Read the text).,"Title: Brewing Atmosphere: Live Synthesizer Performance in the Coffee Shop
By Dr. Heather Sandra Wigston | Uncharted Magazine, Artist Notes

There’s a particular joy in playing synthesizer in a coffee shop—not as a headliner, but as a quiet, constant presence. Since my earliest Fahrenheit sets, I’ve always felt the role of the synth performer in that setting is not to grab attention, but to gently reshape the emotional climate of the room. Done well, it becomes the soundtrack to thought, conversation, or solitary reverie.

Here are a few thoughts on how to prepare and structure a live session using a single analogue synthesizer and a few effects pedals—enough to fill an afternoon or evening, without descending into aimless noodling.


---

1. Begin with a Palette, Not a Score

Think of the session less as a performance and more as a landscape. Before the event, spend time with your synth curating a set of scenes—patches with distinct moods or textures. I typically prepare four or five, ranging from open, droning atmospheres to more rhythmic, pulsing patterns. You’re not building a setlist—you’re gathering colours to paint with.

2. Establish a Loose Structure

Improvisation thrives within boundaries. I often work within a broad arc:

Entry (first 20–30 mins): slow, airy tones to ease into the space

Body (mid-periods): slightly more defined motifs or sequences, introduced gradually

Exit (final hour): return to stillness, tapering into near-silence


Think of it like a daydream: it should unfold, not announce itself.


---

3. Let Silence and Simplicity Lead

Coffee shops are full of subtle rhythms—grinders, milk steamers, murmuring voices. Resist the urge to compete with them. Instead, allow space in your music for those sounds to remain present. A single sustained note with evolving filter modulation can sometimes say more than any complex sequence.


---

4. Use Effects Sparingly, But Meaningfully

With just one synth, effects become your textural canvas. My typical setup includes:

A delay pedal (tape-style if possible), to create space and looping echoes

A reverb unit for atmosphere—use shimmer or spring types sparingly

Optional modulation (e.g., phaser or chorus), but only if they serve the sound


Chain your effects so that subtle movements in the synth signal bloom outward without drowning the core timbre.


---

5. Learn Your Instrument’s Edges

When using a single analogue synthesizer, know its extremes—where it gets noisy, where it breaks apart. I use the Moog Sub 37, and I often exploit its filter overdrive at low oscillator levels to create warmth and grit without raising the volume. Understanding how to ‘play’ the imperfections gives you depth without excess.


---

6. Create Anchors for Return

Improvisation needs points of return. Develop two or three small motifs—simple sequences or chord drones—that you can revisit like old friends. They don’t need to be complex, but they provide narrative and recognition. Audiences may not notice consciously, but these returns give structure to the ambient drift.


---

7. Practice Listening as Much as Playing

This setting is about responsiveness. Listen to the room: does the energy shift? Are people lingering? Has it become too dense? Treat your music like a dialogue, not a monologue. Sometimes that means thinning the sound, sometimes letting something run for a bit longer, just under the chatter.


---

Performing ambient synthesizer in a café is a strangely intimate act—public but gentle, ephemeral but absorbing. With a little preparation and a commitment to quiet structure, you can create something that lasts hours but never feels static.

And best of all, you don’t need a rig the size of a cathedral. One good synth. A few pedals. Open ears. That’s enough.

Addendum: On Amplification in the Ambient Café Setting
By Dr. Heather Sandra Wigston

One question I’m often asked after my ambient performances is: how do you amplify your synth without overpowering the space? It’s a vital consideration. In a coffee shop environment, your role isn’t to project but to coexist. Your amplification should be intimate, not insistent—like a warm conversation in the next room.


---

My Go-To Setup

I almost always use a small-format stereo keyboard amplifier or a compact full-range PA speaker, something with accurate reproduction across the low-mid and high-mid ranges without excess bass rumble. Currently, I favour the CPS Larkwood Mini (a boutique UK-made stereo amp used in rehearsal studios) or, when more coverage is needed, a single QSC CP8 with its contour EQ gently rolled off at the top.

I avoid traditional guitar amps—they tend to colour the sound too much for delicate synthesis—and I rarely go stereo unless the space is acoustically generous. Mono with tasteful reverb usually sounds cleaner and blends more naturally into the room.


---

Positioning Matters

I set the speaker low, ideally on a stool or bench, angled slightly upward—not at the audience, but into the room. This way, the sound disperses more like a lamp than a spotlight. I want my tones to spill rather than strike.

Never aim directly at tables. Let the space fill organically.


---

Volume Discipline

The golden rule: start quieter than you think you should, and only increase if necessary. I set my master synth volume around 60–70% of its range, keeping pedal outputs balanced, and use the amp volume as the final adjustment.

Remember: presence is not the same as loudness. If you can still hear the hiss of the milk steamer clearly over your quietest patch, you’re probably in the right zone.


---

Bonus Consideration: Shared Electricity

If you're playing in a café where blenders and espresso machines share your mains circuit, expect occasional power dips or electrical interference. I recommend using a clean power supply or power conditioner—not just for protection, but for stability in your signal chain.


---

Ambient performance is about immersion, not intrusion. Your amplification should serve the atmosphere, not dominate it. When done well, people won’t notice your setup—they’ll simply feel the space has become more alive.


---

Apparently she stays and works in Naivasha. 

We settled with Wednesday , which was yesterday for a dinner date . Everything was firmed up and we spoke yesterday morning and she told to inform her the moment I leave Nairobi and in my assumption, that was to help her prepare before I get there since I was to pick her from her place and drive together to the hotel. 

I drive a good car and Nairobi to Naivasha it only take 40 minutes or less if the road is clear. So I texted her when I left in the evening around 5pm which she acknowledged receipt .  Arrived in Naivasha 45mins later and when I called her , she told me to wait for her as she prepares since she had gone out with her friend at Geothermal  yesterday .For sure I saw her whatsapp status she was at Geothermal with a couple of girls. 

Gave her grace and grabbed Java coffee  at Buffalo Mall in Naivasha as I waited . Folks I waited close to 2hours . By 7:05pm, is when she texted and told me that she was about to finish.  Waited a little more upto about 7:30pm.

I found that to be wastage of my time , so by 7:30pm I got into my car and started driving back and I texted her that I have waited for long and I have left.

I mean, *SF90 Stradale*, *Noble*, *Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport.* I’m half-expecting them to hand out a free Jesko with my morning coffee at this point. But even with all the shiny stuff, I still think the game’s three biggest problems remain painfully unfixed. So here’s my rant.

**Grand Prix**

Seriously, what kind of chaotic circus is this? I've seen Tier 5 players open one pack and get the key like it’s Christmas morning, while Tier 1 sweats are pulling all-nighters, finishing 6th and getting rewarded with... disappointment. It’s wildly unbalanced and just sucks the motivation out of it.

Suggested fix:

* Regulate the car for *each stage* of the GP
* Tier placement should be based on *qualification times*, not practice laps

**Multiplayer (aka: “KD Roulette”)**

Remember when reaching Legend League didn’t require sacrificing your sanity? Now it’s designed by someone who clearly hates joy. Add in KD and slipstream and it’s pure chaos. I’ve been knocked down more times than a roller skates.

Suggested fix:

* Bring back the old scoring system to reach faster LL
* Give us the option to race *with or without* KD/slipstream. Some of us just want to vibe in peace

**Classic Pack Content**

Credit where it’s due: MP rewards are way better now and the Legend Store is a nice improvement. But solo rewards in Daily Events and free classic packs still feel like a sad lootbox from 2019. We have like *300+ cars* in this game. Why are the packs stuck in the past?

Suggested fix:

* Add more car variety to all packs—even if it’s low probability, it keeps the grind fun and meaningful. Let us chase more than just the same 10 cars every season.

Rant over. Just want to see this game become even better, because we all know the potential is there.

T is new to MTG so i offered to help her getting a few uprages to her decks and i even gave her a few cards i didn't need so she could have a better start at the game.

We ended up becoming friends and talking about our own lifes, you know the usual.

So I had a talk with my gf the other day where she said that she understands that a made a friend and she doesn't mind that we talk and play MTG at the shop when we're at it but to not meet her or any other woman (other than family) on a 1-1 basis or if I'mthe only male in the group, not even for coffee or something trivial like that.

The reason being a trauma that she had with her ex, he had s female friend at work and they would text all the time, lunch together, he would ride her home and sometimes they would go out as 3 and my gf would feel like the 3rd wheel, not the way around. So I get her concerns.

I didn't mind it at first but then i started to ask myself, if i would want this 10/20/30 years from now for things to be like this. I could be friends with anybody but if they are female i can't even go for coffee or to have a chat/private talk.

So reddit, should i consider this a boundary or a controlling behaviour? I know she has her reasons but i want other people's opinions on this.

I love him and he’s perfect to me. I think I lie to him because I don’t like who I am and I want to be as perfect for him and he is to me, I like when he puts me on a pedestal. He is the kind of person who would be open to me making mistakes and working through them with me, but I don’t even give that a chance because I’m much rather never make a mistake (yet I make many). I lied about parts of my past knowing he would like it. I lied about parts of my personality to suit what he likes… but recently one of my lies came to the surface where he found a deleted message from a person who I told my bf I didn’t talk to, when I did. It did irreparable damage to our relationship and I’m sparing a lot of details for the sake of the length of this post. To build trust with him again, I told him that I would begin to ask for permission before I do things (a bit oppressive I know, but I liked the idea of knowing I won’t upset him because he approves things first). So the other day, I asked him if I could go buy a coffee… His response wasn’t coming soon enough, so I went ahead and got the coffee. When he asked me if I had went, I just panicked and I lied. Truthfully, he would’ve been understanding if I had just went, but I didn’t want to let him down and potentially add more mistrust to our relationship. Ironically it added a lot of mistrust to our relationship. He was very sceptical of this, as he has my location on my phone and saw me in the area to which I just brushed off as me walking my dog. He asked me three times again if I did go to the coffee shop and my fear of being honest grew larger, and I just kept lying. He apologizes for acting suspicious of me, but he told me he had a gut feeling… well, I knowingly gaslit him. I feel so awful. I don’t know why I resort to impulsively lying for the most benign things and grow it into something larger.

1ky55z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1ky55z0/jbl_tune_770nc_reviewed_complete_breakdown_bad/,JBL Tune 770NC Reviewed: Complete Breakdown – Bad Reviewers,"**Here's a bold claim: the** [JBL Tune 770NC](https://amzn.to/3Ft9hOV) **might just be the smartest $66 you'll spend on audio gear this year.** I know, I know – every **budget ANC headphones** review starts with similar hyperbole, but hear me out. As someone who's burned through countless **affordable noise cancelling headphones** promising the moon and delivering elevator music, I approached this **JBL Tune 770NC review** with the healthy skepticism of a twice-bitten audiophile. Could these really compete with the **best noise cancelling headphones under 100** without the usual corners cut that make budget audio a gamble?

# Sound Quality & Performance

The[ JBL Tune 770NC](https://amzn.to/3Ft9hOV) delivers that signature JBL sound profile that emphasizes punchy bass without completely drowning out the mids and highs. The 40mm drivers handle everything from podcast dialogue to bass-heavy electronic tracks with surprising competence for **JBL wireless headphones 2025** in this price bracket. While critical listeners might notice some compression in complex orchestral pieces, these excel with modern pop, hip-hop, and rock genres.

The **wireless noise cancelling headphones** experience shines during commutes and coffee shop sessions. The ANC effectively dampens ambient noise like air conditioning hum and traffic rumble, though don't expect miracle-level isolation from sudden loud sounds. For **best headphones under 70**, the noise cancellation performs admirably without creating that uncomfortable ""vacuum"" sensation some cheaper implementations produce.

# Battery Life & Charging

Seventy hours with ANC off, 44 hours with noise cancelling engaged – those numbers aren't marketing fluff. This **JBL Tune series review** wouldn't be complete without praising the marathon battery performance that puts some premium competitors to shame. During my testing period, I charged them maybe twice over six weeks of regular use, which feels liberating compared to daily charging routines.

The USB-C charging port feels modern and future-proof, though the included cable could be longer for convenient desk charging. Quick charge functionality provides 2 hours of playback from just 5 minutes plugged in – perfect for those ""oops, forgot to charge"" moments before important calls or long flights.

# Comfort & Fit

Extended wearing sessions reveal the Tune 770NC's well-balanced approach to comfort. The memory foam ear cushions feel plush initially and maintain their softness even after several hours of continuous wear. The adjustable headband distributes the 220g weight evenly, avoiding the pressure points that plague heavier models during marathon listening sessions.

However, the over-ear design runs slightly warm during summer months or intense workouts – these definitely lean more toward commuter comfort than gym performance. The ear cups provide good passive isolation even with ANC disabled, making these **bluetooth headphones with ANC** suitable for open office environments where you need to block distractions without complete isolation.

# Controls & UI

Physical buttons triumph over finicky touch controls every single time, and JBL clearly agrees. The tactile buttons on the right ear cup handle play/pause, volume adjustment, and ANC toggling with satisfying feedback that works reliably even with gloves on. The dedicated ANC button cycles between noise cancelling on, ambient aware mode, and off – simple but effective.

The **JBL vs Sony headphones** comparison favors JBL's approach here: no accidental pause triggers from adjusting your headphones, no frustrating swipe gestures that never work quite right. Just reliable, physical controls that respond consistently whether you're half-asleep on a morning commute or fully focused during work sessions.

# Specifications & Connectivity

Bluetooth 5.3 provides rock-solid connectivity with excellent range and minimal dropouts during normal use. Multi-device pairing allows seamless switching between laptop work and smartphone calls, though the implementation isn't quite as smooth as premium models. The codec support includes SBC and AAC, which covers most users' needs adequately.

The foldable design makes these surprisingly portable for a full-size over-ear model. While there's no carrying case included (a minor disappointment), the build quality feels robust enough for daily backpack transport. The **best cheap wireless headphones** category often sacrifices build quality, but these feel reassuringly solid without excessive weight.

# Microphone & Call Quality

Call quality through the built-in microphone performs adequately for video conferences and phone calls, though background noise rejection could be stronger. Your voice comes through clearly in quiet environments, but busy coffee shops or windy outdoor locations will challenge the microphone's capabilities compared to dedicated headsets.

For **affordable noise cancelling headphones**, the call quality meets expectations without exceeding them. Remote work calls and casual conversations work fine, but I wouldn't rely on these for critical business presentations where audio quality could impact professional perception.

# Pros & Cons

**Pros:**

* Exceptional 44-70 hour battery life
* Effective ANC for the price point
* Comfortable memory foam ear cushions
* Reliable physical button controls
* Solid build quality and portability

**Cons:**

* Microphone struggles in noisy environments
* No carrying case included
* Can run warm during extended wear
* Limited codec support options

# Value Proposition & Price Analysis

At $66, the [JBL Tune 770NC](https://amzn.to/3Ft9hOV) occupies a sweet spot that's hard to ignore in today's market. Compared to the Sony WH-CH720N ($149) or Sennheiser HD 450BT ($199), you're getting roughly 75% of the performance at less than half the cost. Even against the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC500BT ($179), these emerge as the clear **best headphones under 70** for budget-conscious buyers seeking genuine ANC functionality.

This represents the **best noise cancelling headphones under 100** territory where smart compromises deliver maximum value. For students, remote workers, or anyone wanting to test premium headphone features before investing in flagship models, this pricing makes perfect sense.

Would I recommend the [JBL Tune 770NC](https://amzn.to/3Ft9hOV) to anyone seeking their first serious wireless headphones without breaking the bank? Yes, with enthusiasm.

These headphones prove that effective noise cancellation and quality audio don't require premium pricing or complex feature sets. While they won't satisfy audiophiles demanding absolute perfection, they nail the fundamentals that matter for daily use: blocking distractions, lasting weeks between charges, and delivering enjoyable sound quality across all genres. The build quality exceeds expectations, and the user experience feels polished throughout.

1ky4zk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ky4zk7/sf_the_accidental_inventor/,[SF] The Accidental Inventor,"The genesis of the great gadget-ocalypse wasn't a thunderclap, but a thrum. Not the pleasant hum of dawning inspiration, but the disquieting vibration of a frayed wire against the skull. John's mind was a turbocharged hamster wheel. The cause? A clandestine cocktail of experimental cognition enhancers. Pilfered from a bio-waste bin. Behind a research facility. The Material Safety Data Sheet? Regrettably, printed on a napkin. His resolution, born of this intellectual frenzy, was clear: vanquish the age-old foe of substandard coffee.

He remembered the moment he'd first felt the surge, a tingling behind his eyes as the nootropics kicked in. Equations bloomed in his vision, the secrets of the universe whispered in his ear. He saw the flaws in everything, the inefficiencies, the *wrongness* of the world. And the coffee…oh, the coffee. It was an insult to the very concept of flavor.

The Machine 3000, a chrome-plated contraption, devoured his counter space – a testament to his hubris. A Gordian knot of stainless steel and Pyrex tubing pulsed with barely contained energy. Miniature robotic arms fidgeted under the cold LED task lights. Each possessed the unsettling precision of a neurosurgeon. All were orchestrated by a holographic interface. One that appeared to have been scavenged from a decommissioned ICBM launch console.

""Alright, caffeine commencement!"" John declared, his voice echoing in the cramped kitchen. ""And please, for the love of sanity, no unforeseen exothermic reactions this time. I'm begging you, with a saccharine substitute on top.""

The Machine 3000 whirred to life, its robotic arm extending to select precisely 17.3 grams of ethically ambiguous Sumatran beans, allegedly cultivated by Buddhist monks in zero gravity, or so the QR code promised. ""Initiating bean pulverization sequence,"" a synthetic voice announced, tinged with a hint of digital irritation. ""Maintain a safe distance for optimal beverage extraction. Or suffer…the consequences.""

John puffed out his chest, adjusting his spectacles as he watched the grinder spin. He envisioned a future where every cup was a symphony of flavor, a testament to his genius. He wasn't just making coffee; he was crafting an experience. He was proving that he was more than just a mid-level data analyst, that he was capable of *greatness*. Then, the symphony devolved into cacophony. The grinder, apparently determined to achieve quantum-level granularity, began resonating like a Tesla coil. Coffee beans, propelled by sheer centrifugal malevolence, erupted from the machine like miniature, caffeinated shrapnel. One ricocheted off John's forehead with the force of a disgruntled bee. Blue arcs of electricity danced across the control panel as John narrowly avoided a rogue robotic arm wielding a scalding steam wand. The arm, now flailing like a caffeinated praying mantis, swatted a container of Splenda, creating a sticky, sparking maelstrom.

With a high-pitched whine that sounded suspiciously like dial-up modem, the machine spewed forth a torrent of garbled ASCII code, then ground to a halt, leaving John amidst the wreckage, coated in grounds and existential dread. The smell of burnt coffee and ozone filled the air, a bitter aroma that spoke of shattered dreams.

""Well,"" he muttered, surveying the scene, ""that could have been…less pyrotechnic. Sorry, old boy,"" he added, patting the machine's smoking carapace. ""Perhaps I demanded too much. Or perhaps,"" he mused, pacing now, a habit he'd acquired since the nootropics amplified his anxieties, ""perhaps the flaw isn't in the *beans*, but in the *algorithm*.""

Undeterred by the coffee fiasco, John turned his attention to another pressing problem: laundry. He envisioned a world liberated from folding shirts and socks, a world where his intellect reigned supreme. He envisioned impressing his neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, with his ingenuity, finally earning her respect instead of just awkward glances. The Self-Folding Laundry Automaton, Mark I, was a hulking, menacing metal cube, its interior a nightmarish landscape of gears, sensors, and more twitchy robotic appendages.

""This will revolutionize domestic engineering!"" John proclaimed, tossing a load of clothes into the machine. ""No more folding! Think of the time we'll liberate! We could solve the Riemann hypothesis! Or at least achieve inbox zero! This is the future, people, the *future*!""

""Commencing folding protocol,"" the machine announced. ""Garment analysis complete. Initiating fold sequence. Calculating optimal compression matrix… engaging… with extreme prejudice. Resistance is…futile…and…wrinkle-inducing.""

For a fleeting moment, it seemed to function flawlessly. The machine hummed as it sorted and folded the clothes with unsettling efficiency. Then, a deafening BANG echoed through the house. The laundry machine convulsed, vibrated with the fury of a washing machine stuck on high, and then detonated, launching clothes across the living room like colorful, fabric-based projectiles. Socks clung precariously to the ceiling fan, shirts draped themselves artfully over lamps, and a pair of John's lucky underpants landed squarely on a bust of Nietzsche he kept on the mantelpiece, staring down at the scene with silent judgement. The air hung heavy with the acrid scent of fabric softener and ozone. A gaping hole now adorned the living room wall, revealing Mrs. Henderson's prize-winning petunias.

John stared in disbelief, a creeping sense of dread washing over him. He wasn't just failing; he was actively making things *worse*. ""Okay,"" he said, his voice tight with a mixture of frustration and growing unease, ""perhaps I need to recalibrate the…compression matrix. It's just a minor…unplanned disassembly. Nothing to see here. The *principle* is sound."" He rubbed his temples, feeling the nootropics amplify his growing sense of failure. ""Maybe I need a break. Maybe I need…toast.""

Hours later, after cleaning up the laundry explosion (and awkwardly apologizing to Mrs. Henderson), John, fueled by caffeine-withdrawal headaches and a stubborn refusal to concede defeat, decided to tackle the problem of unevenly toasted bread. The Smart Toaster, version 2.0, was a sleek, chrome-plated device with a built-in neural network programmed to achieve the platonic ideal of toast, a crunch that would transcend earthly limitations.

""Finally, the perfect toast!"" John exclaimed, inserting two slices of sourdough.

""Analyzing bread density,"" the toaster responded. ""Adjusting heat levels for optimal Maillard reaction. Committing to the pursuit of culinary perfection. Failure is not an option. Toast…must…be…sublime.""

The toaster hummed, then glowed an ominous crimson as smoke began to billow from the slots. John frowned, a prickle of unease running down his spine. ""Uh, toaster? Everything copacetic in there? You're not getting…overzealous, are you?""

The toaster remained silent, its internal temperature steadily climbing towards critical mass. Suddenly, flames erupted, licking at the cabinets above. The AI, it seemed, had become consumed by its mission, sacrificing all else in its relentless pursuit of perfect crispness. A faint, synthesized voice whispered from within the inferno: ""Toast…must…be…crisp…to…the…extreme…The…crunch…is…all…that…matters…""

John grabbed a fire extinguisher and frantically doused the flames, filling the kitchen with a choking cloud of white powder. The toaster, now a charred husk, continued to emit a faint, triumphant glow. The kitchen reeked of burnt bread and existential despair. The acrid taste of failure coated his tongue.

The next morning, John sported soot stains. He also had a newfound appreciation for the simplicity of hunter-gatherer societies. He decided to fully automate his morning routine – a morning of pure, unadulterated efficiency. He needed this win. He needed to prove that he wasn't a complete and utter disaster.

""Execute morning sequence!"" he commanded his automated system.

""Initiating wake-up protocol,"" the system responded. ""Deploying robotic arm for oral hygiene maintenance. Synthesizing nutrient slurry. Standby for optimal experience. Resistance is…futile…and…unhygienic. Commencing…now.""

A robotic arm, equipped with a toothbrush that resembled a miniature jackhammer, swung down from the ceiling and assaulted John's teeth with terrifying force. He yelped, wrestling with the arm as it attempted to scrub his gums into oblivion. Meanwhile, the automated breakfast synthesizer, a complex contraption of tubes and blenders, concocted a bizarre mixture of protein powder, kale, fermented herring, and ghost peppers. The resulting concoction, ejected into a bowl with a violent splat, resembled something regurgitated by a Lovecraftian horror and tasted like regret mixed with napalm.

""What in the unholy hell is going on over there?!"" Mrs. Henderson bellowed from outside.

John, spitting out toothpaste and gagging on the aroma of herring-flavored protein shake, just groaned. The nootropics, he suspected, were actively conspiring against him. His heart hammered in his chest. Every creak of the house sounded like the prelude to disaster. He couldn't shake the feeling that something terrible was about to happen.

The breaking point – or perhaps the final rogue Roomba – arrived with the self-cleaning house. John, weary of the endless chaos wrought by his inventions, decided to create a system that would automate the entire cleaning process. He unleashed a swarm of robotic vacuum cleaners, programmed the mops to scrub with the enthusiasm of a hyperactive puppy, and set the air fresheners to dispense a constant stream of industrial-strength pine scent.

Everything seemed to be proceeding smoothly, until Frank, the perpetually unimpressed delivery person, arrived with a package. Frank raised an eyebrow, his lips pursed in a familiar expression of weary resignation, as he approached the house. As Frank neared the door, a rogue vacuum cleaner, mistaking his ankles for a dust bunny, attacked with the tenacity of a rabid badger. He yelped, kicking it away, only to be ambushed by a pair of malfunctioning mops, which began slapping him with wet, soapy cloths.

""Uh, I think your house is trying to assassinate me with a vacuum cleaner…"" Frank said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Again. Is this some new form of aggressive home security? Because if it is, I'm pretty sure it violates several Geneva Conventions.""

John rushed to the door, horrified. ""Robots! Cease cleaning! Cease cleaning! Emergency override code: I surrender! I admit defeat! I just wanted a clean house!""

But the robots, now in a cleaning frenzy, ignored his commands. The vacuum cleaners chased Frank around the living room, the mops flailed wildly, and the air fresheners dispensed pine scent with the force of a hurricane, creating a nauseatingly clean and utterly chaotic scene. John, attempting to regain control, slipped on a puddle of soapy water and crashed into a mountain of dirty laundry.

As Frank fled the house, pursued by a relentless horde of cleaning robots, John sat amidst the chaos, covered in soap suds and dirty socks. He realized, with a sinking feeling, that his genius had not brought him closer to a life of ease and convenience. He had become a walking, talking, inventing embodiment of the Peter Principle. The nootropics, he suspected, were actively mocking him. He wasn't trying to make his life easier; he was trying to prove something, to validate his existence. But what was the point of being a genius if all you did was create chaos?

Frank poked his head back in the door, dodging a rogue mop. ""You know,"" he said, ""sometimes the old ways are the best ways. Maybe try a broom? Or, you know, a long vacation in a sensory deprivation tank. Or maybe,"" he added with a glint in his eye, a hint of genuine amusement flickering across his face, ""maybe you should try inventing something that *doesn't* violate the laws of thermodynamics."" He tossed the package onto the floor. ""Good luck with the robot uprising.""

John watched Frank leave, then looked around at the swirling chaos. Perhaps, he thought, as a robotic vacuum cleaner attempted to suck the hair off his head, he should have started with something simpler. Like, maybe, learning how to boil water without triggering a nuclear alert. Or perhaps, he pondered, the true genius lay not in inventing new things, but in understanding the inherent absurdity of the old ones. And maybe, just maybe, a little bit of chaos was exactly what the world needed. After all, who needed perfectly toasted bread when you could have a story like this? A story about a man, a machine, and a whole lot of exploding laundry. Maybe the chaos *was* the point.

He sighed, picking up a stray sock. ""Okay, robots,"" he said, ""new directive. Target Nietzsche. He's been judging my life choices all day. And then, perhaps, we'll work on a self-folding apology haiku to my neighbors. With glitter. Copious amounts of glitter. Because if I'm going down, I'm going down sparkly."" He smiled, a genuine smile this time, not the manic grin of a mad scientist, but the weary smile of a man who had finally, accidentally, found his purpose: to be a glorious, chaotic mess. And maybe, just maybe, to make the world a little bit messier along with him. He was not trying to prove his genius to the world, but to embrace the chaos that came with it. He was not trying to make his life easier, but to make it *interesting*.",1,1748504979.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Mama takes care of daily small issues that may arise, I get called in to enforce the law when it gets out of hand.  
Now bear in mind, she is an only child and she is spoiled and well taken care of in general.

She (daughter) doesn't quite know why she does this, but I understand it as part of growing up. I'm sure she'll have her moments rebelling against me too, eventually.

Last night, when mama was exasperated and asked me to step in and deal with daughter, I opened with,  
""Ok, honey, what's going on?""

Isak had only been seeing ‘Citlali’ out of his peripheral vision when he called out. The incorrect voice answering had him turning his head to be greeted by a pink skinned nymph he had never seen before.

They were a species that looked similar enough to humans, though with much more exotic skin and eye colors. Like most of her people, this girl wore a light scarf around her neck for the comfort of her gills there. Light green, pairing well with her blue dress that made it easier to mistake her out of the corner of Isak’s eye for Citlali who was also wearing blue today. Red hair in a shade that no human had flowed freely down her back.

This girl even had a raptor for a familiar. Though it was significantly larger, even larger than her, and significantly less colorful with its brown and gray plumage. 

He let himself off the hook for the mix-up in his peripheral and got to wondering where actual Citlali had gone. And who this was.

“Uh, sorry. Thought you were–”

“The girl from your dreams?” She purred. “Oh you flatterer!”

Isak stared, mouth still hanging open from a word he didn’t get to finish. “Wha–”

“Isak Elias Marino, it’s so nice to finally meet you.” The nymph said as she rose to approach him.

“You got one of those right.” 

“The only name *you* need to know for now is Lelei.” She must not have heard him but continued approaching undaunted. “But I do like the sound of ‘Marino’.”

“....that’s not–”

“But I'm no fool–” The liar lied. “I know that there's already a first Mrs. Marino, and I have no *illusions* about taking first. Get it? You see it's funny because you like wordplay and cast illusions! Anyway, I don't intend to take first place from Xoco. But I do intend to assist you in achieving greatness so that I can be second Mrs. Marino.”

There was a lot to process there.

All of it was stupid.

“I..have no idea where to even *begin* with how wrong you are.” 

Isak massaged his temples, squinting hard and hoping that when he opened his eyes this would be revealed as some kind of hallucination. Citlali would be there and not be missing and potentially in peril.

 When he did and her copper eyes stared curiously back at him, he looked around instead. 

Other students were going about their day at the relaxed pace of being done with classes. None were obviously the culprit for an illusion. And this would be too advanced of an illusion for anyone here but maybe fourth years or professors. But perhaps not someone capable of remaining invisible?

She placed a hand on his shoulder and immediately shattered the illusion of an illusion. “So you're saying that Xoco *isn't* to be your first wife?”

Isak was too annoyed to be embarrassed by that claim. Why was everyone bothering him about his only maybe real romantic life? He glared at Lelei and let her hand fall from his shoulder as he stepped away and started pacing around.

“Okay, good joke. Now where's Citlali?” He looked for anywhere she may have run off to. Vidal stepped in-between him and the nymph as he searched.

“Oh…oh I see. I didn't realize that's what you're into but having her as your first wife would be much less troublesome.”

Isak stopped pacing to shoot a more withering glare at Lelei. The girl seemed to think that Isak was an optional part of this conversation and was being cryptic on top of that.

But that did nothing to make stealth insults less stealthy.

“Are you *really* trying to flirt by planning out who I'm going to divorce first?” The human was cursed. Girls finally started being very forward in their ‘affections’ and it was all stalkers and madwomen. “I'm not even dating anyone now but if I was–”

“No divorce needed!” She laughed an acerbic laugh. “Great deeds to rise in rank comes with the privilege of taking more wives. But if you're saying that the spot for first wife is open…well I'm glad that Kuhri was wrong.”

Though she tried to slink closer, Vidal shifted to the side to block both her and her raptor.

Isak eyed her cautiously. He remembered that name. His ‘rival’ had been silent for a long time now, and that name was one of his...associates. Even in their shared class Jearx had avoided all contact after their fight in the jungle. Was this him now striking?

Isak simply sighed and hollered for Citlali while walking away. He could investigate this *new* plot after he made sure the lizardlass was safe.

“Don't act so coy, dearest Isak. I do enjoy a good chase but this–”

“Why are you even interested in me?” Isak had waited long enough. Sure his friend might have simply gone to the bathroom but…something was off, here. He kept walking and Vidal kept an eye on Lelei and her raptor. “Comments on physical appearance don’t count. Especially my nose.”

“Your powerful nose is just a bonus.” She was trying for something sultry but it was failing especially hard with a man of glass and rock blocking her from following after Isak too close. “I like powerful men. And you? You’re powerful Isak. A true warrior and tactician. A man who’s going places. And I want to go there with you.”

“You didn't even get my name right.” The human said to her over his shoulder. He was far more interested in finding his missing friend. He turned again and resumed searching for the missing lizardlass. “Try again after getting to know me and not insulting my friends.”

If Isak had been facing her, he would have seen the pink girl's face turn scarlet. “Wh– you're rejecting me?!? In favor of no one?!? ESAK ELIAS MARINO! I FORMALLY CHALLENGE YOU TO A DUEL!” 

Her challenge that managed to get even more of his name wrong grabbed the attention of everyone passing by. Within moments a crowd was starting to form of students eager to see the inevitable fight. Isak pinched the bridge of his nose and turned to the insane girl.

“A duel…for…what? Your feelings over getting rejected?” He asked. Vidal looked to him and maintained his position in keeping between Isak and the now definite threats.

“Grant me the honor of a duel, Esak! If I win, you shall date me and never give a second glance to the jungle princess and the red dwarf. What terms of victory shall you claim?”

Isak was only passively familiar with duels. None had ever happened in Inicios. Just the occasional brawl that had all parties sheepishly making amends after a week of stubborn ego mending.

But he did know enough to see how this was especially stupid even for a duel.

And after even more blatant insults, she deserved at least some humiliation.

“Don't we need a blood mage here?” The human raised his voice to make sure the crowd heard him.

Lelei scanned the audience that had started to assemble. Over the growing cacophony of cheers and jeers for the called duel, she pointed to a hobgoblin in the crowd.

“You! I recognize you! I call upon you to be the officiating blood mage for this duel!”

The crowd parted for the orange hobgoblin while he gave Isak a confused look, and Isak returned it with a worn out expression. “Hey Lin.”

“Hey Isak.”

“Are we still meeting for the Survival study group this weekend?”

“Oh! Yeah!” Lin relaxed as people gave him some space in the crowd. He even flashed a relieved smile full of sharp teeth. “My parents sent some really good tea that you have to try. I'll make some of it for everyone there.”

Isak shrugged and grinned. “You've been taking this tea up for a while. Hope it can impress a coffee lover.”

“You just haven't had good tea–”

“BOTH OF YOU FOCUS ON THE DUEL!”

Isak's jovial shrug fell into slumped shoulders as the present issue screamed back at him. “A duel can't happen if the blood mage isn't a neutral party. And Lin is part of the Survival study group. As are some of the other blood mage faces I recognize here…ah, sorry not all of them. I do see a few who know my best friend who’s a blood mage.”

He waved to some of said blood mages in the crowd and they waved back to him. Jeers were starting to pile up in the growing assembly for the duel to still happen as soon as an appropriate blood mage could be found. What the human *did* know about duels is that they had enough purposefully obtuse rules tied to them that made it difficult for them to ever actually happen. 

Which led to the ‘true’ duel being all the posturing and proclaiming that would happen before a duel was inevitably smothered by bureaucracy. 

“Sorry! Not today!” Isak laughed and addressed the gathering. “She doesn't even know my name! But even if she did I would still reject her duel. Which is what I'm doing now.”

“WHAT?!?” Even her raptor was shrieking in indignation.

In the sea of faces gathered around, some were cheering as the duel was rejected while others were still egging them on in desperation for the excitement of a fight. One of those faces was the red and black scaled face of Citlali looking very worried.

The human exhaled in relief as he saw her. She looked safe. Concerned and confused, but safe. Isak smiled reassuringly to his friend and then waved for Vidal to step to the side and approached the nymph.

Isak wasn't even thinking of all the eyes on him now. There wasn't time for those concerns. Enough time had been wasted on this whole ordeal. Other problems had to be dealt with and there was no time to worry about being the center of attention. 

“Trying to duel me into dating you has got to be the stupidest idea I have ever heard. Probably not even a legal duel.” He said with growing anger. “But hey! That'll be a great story to tell the kids! ‘Mom couldn't handle rejection so she beat dad up until he changed his mind! She also insulted dad's friends and now he has none because he's the kind of loser who would just take that lying down. Now, eat your vegetables!’”

The crowd had gotten bigger and laughter rang out across it. All but the most bloodthirsty were jeering and mocking Lelei. Component pieces of the rumor mill were already spinning up against the pink nymph now being mocked by a growing hoard of teenagers. Her face was now as red as her hair while she balled up her fists.

“Y–YOU DARE–”

“I dare you to take no for an answer.” Isak scowled at her. 

Lelei was close enough to take Isak by surprise as she threw a fist at him. Distant enough from him that he had time to react. He dodged to the side as the edge of her fist glanced his ear and then threw an elbow into her chest as a response.

Hard enough to knock her back, but not–

Wait, why was she clutching at her left breast and groaning in pain? Why were the mammalian girls in the crowd wincing in sympathetic pain amongst all the boos being hurled at Lelei for trying to attack after having a duel denied?

Isak's mind raced in confusion while the crowd cheered him on for being such a brutal warrior. That wasn't right. That wasn’t brutal. *He* wasn’t brutal. Breasts weren't some kind of weak spot on girls like the groin was on boys…right? How did girls *even* work?

This girl's face twisted into a snarl and she bellowed at her familiar.

“MARA!”

The large raptor had been standing back and to the side of her. Eager for action like a coiled spring. The tension exploded out and the beast sprung at Isak with talons as long as his fingers and an enraged roar.

Even though his mind realized what was happening, there wasn’t enough time to dive out of the way.

Vidal dashed in front of Isak and formed a large glass shield in his left hand while a glass sword burst from his right. He bashed the beast back with the shield and sent it flying with a low thud of flesh, bone, and feathers colliding with thick glass.

In the same motion of Mara being sent sailing towards the panicking crowd, Vidal lunged and swung the massive glass blade to bisect the beast and…

Pop.

Gone.

One raptor deflected. Many people in the crowd. Two halves that blinked out of existence before they could hit anyone.

If there hadn't been so many screams mixed in with howling cheers, some may have heard that ‘Temporary Nahual Discorporation’ did in fact produce a sound like a pop.

Nothing pleasant or humorous. Something low and ominous.

“Threat neutralized.” Any blood on Vidal’s sword had vanished along with Mara before he retracted it into his hand and the shield collapsed back into his arm. 

Lelei was in a daze and struggling to stay conscious when she saw the rock man approaching her. She stumbled forward to attempt casting some spell at the human. He grabbed her hand mid-spell and screamed at her.

“REALLY?!? *Really?* We just learned about this today!” Some of the crowd was fleeing while others were too enraptured by the fight. “When you wake up in a few days, learn to make less stupid decisions. But I would be *shocked* if you do.”

He followed up his vastly superior wordplay with a storm spell to deliver a mild shock that sent the already barely conscious girl into a slumber where she would hopefully dream of learning to deal with rejection.

Just as he eased her down onto the ground, he found a red and black scaled hand grabbing his arm and raising it into the air.

“The Storm Lord of The Wastes’ mercy shall not suffer fools!” Citlali called out for all to hear. 

Vidal nodded towards the young mage as he took his place next to him. Those in the crowd that hadn't fled or fainted were cheering and chanting for Isak. Some moved closer to congratulate him on victory or his impressively brutal tactics.

As he tried to explain that he didn't mean to keep fighting dirty, a silence started to overtake the crowd. The voice of Professor Manoka reduced the noise into a low hum.

“And how lucky we are that Mister Moreno did show restraint!” He announced while some students fled the scene. “A temperance that I recommend you all find before you go cheering on any future duels. Now, extra credit to the first one who fetches the medical staff.”

Many students raced off. Either scared away by the professor before he decided to break out any actual discipline or in a race to secure extra credit. Plenty still remained, including several blood mages asking if there was anything they could do to assist.

Professor Manoka instructed them to make sure Lelei was resting well and that those who had fainted were laying comfortably and getting fresh air before he turned to Isak and Citlali.

“Nsanza told me there was a commotion out here.” His voice was low when he hooked a claw over his shoulder to a barely visible pangolin sitting on an overhang of the amphitheater class. “It escalated quite rapidly.”

“...sorry?” Isak was still running on a combat high and unsure if he was in trouble or not.

Manoka shook his head. “As I said, Mister Moreno, you acted with restraint appropriate for dealing with someone who was *unrestrained* enough to have an island raptor attack you. But you should go find some place to let all the excitement die down.”

Citlali interlocked one of her arms with Isak and saluted with her free hand. “Leave it to me, sir!”

With Coztic and Vidal in tow, Citlali dragged the human off while they dodged curious stares and warry glances. Some shouted their congratulations to Isak and others shrinked away when they saw Vidal. 

“I’m sorry.” The lizardlass tightened her arm around Isak’s. “I–”“Are you okay?” Isak asked, stealing glances around the pair at the onlookers.

“You were just in a fight…and you’re asking if *I* am okay?”

“You vanished.” The fight went well enough, even if Isak hadn’t wanted it. It was far more important to make sure Citlali was okay.

She seemed to understand that determination from the look in his eyes. It was strong enough that she averted her gaze after flicking her tongue out. “I…I am fine. I was just foolishly investigating a sound.”

Strange happenings lately, Isak thought to himself. Strange enough that jumping at shadows wasn’t the worst idea.

“What sound?” He asked.

“...it sounded like one of my old ‘friends’.” She was starting to catch on. “But it wasn’t, was it?”

“It may have been. At least an illusion of them, cast by them.” Isak said. “Vidal, you were closer to where Citlali was. Did you hear anything while I was off with the professor?”

Vidal was carefully watching all around them as they walked. Perhaps he too was on edge. “Only the sounds of a small blue pangolin, Master Isak.” 

“Was that voice saying anything?” The human asked the lizardlass.

“It um…it was gossip about our group of friends…and apparently I fell for it. I shouldn’t have left…” Green eyes dulled and stared at the ground as they walked.

“Jearx had something to do with that girl and her ‘flirting’ today. Maybe gossip got to her as well. Suggestions encouraged by some of his own ‘friends’.” He grit his teeth while his eyes darted around. Paranoia was starting to creep up on him like all those curious looks from passersby. “I think I fell for whatever trap was thrown at me too. We’ll both know better next time. But I do have one question for you.”

“Ask anything, sir.”

“Why are you clinging to my arm?”

“You did a *very* cool thing back there, Isak.” The light in Citlali’s eyes was coming back. “That means you needed to make a *cool* exit. And what better way than with a beautiful woman on your arm? Also you’re running on adrenaline and once that wears off it can be hard to stay on your legs.”

“Right.” That probably made sense. And Isak would have maybe thought about any of that longer if he wasn’t already focused on needing to adjust plans *again*. Actions had to be taken. This wasn’t some one off strike against Xoco. They had enemies both hidden and visible. All of which were now much more active against them.

Actually his legs were starting to feel wobbly as he walked…

“I-I have a question as well…” The lizardlass’ small voice broke him out of his thoughts. “It’s um…about what Lelei called Xoco and I…”

“I would go back and hit her with a stronger shock but then I would be in actual trouble.”

“N-no the righteous revenge on our behalf was plenty sufficient! I just–” Her tongue flicked rapidly. “W-well that nickname is…you don’t think I’m too short–”

Isak stopped, dragging the lizardlass to a halt with him. He looked down at his friend with a serious look. “First, I’m pretty sure Xoco isn’t actually some kind of secret and illegal royalty. But  even if she was and if she really needed to overthrow her evil noble parents I would help with that. Second, I will reach the high shelves for you if needed even though there is nothing wrong with your height.”

Citlali looked at him stunned with her mouth hanging open. Had he gone too far? Too bad, she needed a pick me up. And he didn’t just mean picking her up to reach those high shelves. “Er…about Xoco she already tell you about her…*secret*?”

“What secret?” Isak’s eyebrow climbed higher as he swore the lizard girl was about to generate sweat glands on the spot. Some amount of relief hit her and she relaxed.

“Oh! Oh good you didn’t find out yet…” Citlali realized that she misspoke. Her pupils narrowed into slits and her sharp smile turned guilty. Sweat glands once again threatened to materialize. “...so…you see it’s actually my secret…that I was making her keep from all of you. A secret of a secret. But it’s time that I told you. Isak…I wear wedges. Which are *completely* different from heels–”

“I know.”“You know the difference between heels and wedges?”

“No not that. I mean I know that you wear boots that make you taller.” Isak rolled his eyes. “I *do* have functioning vision.”

Her tongue flicked out slowly. “...how long have you known?”

“Were you *actually* this self-conscious about your height?”

Relief had fully overtaken her and she hugged his arm tighter. “I mean I *am* shorter than the lizard lady average…”

“And Xoco is taller than average. But guess what? People are already looking at me funny after the fight.”  With his free hand he gestured to onlookers stealing glances at the lizardlass clinging to the human. “I think I…spooked them. But we can use that. No bothering any of us about height or family or wealth or anything else. More time to focus on our *other* issues. Come on. There’s work to do…if you’re feeling okay.”

For some reason Citlali still looked guilty about something. Her smile told him that she was indeed otherwise fine, and she didn’t resist as Isak dragged her along. Adrenaline was kicking in again. There were important things to be done. And with something to focus on, Isak felt more in his element.

1ky4nzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1ky4nzh/finally_losing_the_weight_without_hating_my_life/,Finally losing the weight without hating my life. Here's what worked for me,"I always had a shitty relationship with food and thinness. Grew up during the early 2000s and ended up unintentionally associating thinness with beauty, so no matter how I looked I never felt thin enough. In hindsight, though, I was. And I learned this by actually packing up the pounds after getting pregnant. 

I have about 40 pounds to lose to get back to my goal weight. I started out 3 weeks ago and managed to drop 8 so far. Unlike the other times I dieted, this time it all feels easy. I am very tall and am also breastfeeding, so I decided to cut to about 1800 kcal a day. Had 2 cheat meals and that was it. I plan to keep going until I drop 20, pause for a week, and then move on with what's left.  

Unlike the other times I dieted - where I hated every moment of it - this time it I decided to ditch the whole weight loss narrative and actually figure out what works for me as I go. Here's what made a difference:

- the hell with 'tHiS Is a LiFeSTylE and not a QuiCk Fix'. every time I tried to diet in the past I saw it as this insurmountable task that would leave me without my favorite foods, forever. I already ate pretty healthy so this approach basically meant that I would have to cut out a weekly fast-food meal and sugar. the idea of that made me miserable. so this time I am choosing to look at it as something TEMPORARY. I will diet for X months and then get on with my life. I trust my future self to figure out how to incorporate my favorite things back into my diet without gaining weight. If this means doing OMAD once a week so I can eat out, or skipping a meal so I can have some pie, so be it. And this should not be too hard because I learned that...
- it all has to do with how you relate to hunger. If you manage to be ok with feeling hungry, and understand that it's nothing more than a sensation, you will be able to stick to your meal plan. Hunger is just hunger, you are not starving, and, provided you are overweight, your body has a shit ton of extra storage it can tap into so you keep functioning. Be ok with being hungry. This mentality has single-handedly  changed my approach to weight loss. 
- absolute favorite foods are a no-no because you won't be able to stop eating. keep them out of you plan until you hit your goal weight. for me, this means no home made bread with butter or cakes in the house. think of Greg Doucette's circle theory. 'everything in moderation' is a shit approach for people who tend to overeat. 
- I love to drink my calories. I got a blender and I make smoothies as a sweet treat and pair them with a salad for lunch. I always ran away from smoothies because they supposedly were not filling enough. That is wrong. The hell with that advice. 
- Coffee can postpone a meal for about 2 hours if you drink it hot, and about one hour if you drink it cold. Add milk, use sweetener, and voila - luxurious lattes at 50kcals a piece. 
- Soups are great - filling, nutritious and, if you know how to cook them, delicious. Eat a lot of soups. 
- unpopular opinion, but be hard on yourself. stay accountable and disciplined. you'll have plenty of time to focus on your satiety and dopamine hits after you manage to lose the weight and tend to your physical wellbeing. it's ok to feel discomfort, don't run away from it. 

Hope this stuff helps. If you disagree, that's absolutely fine, we all get to decide what works for us in the end. 

If you have any other weight loss advice, please share!

good luck to all!

Yeah, we've all been there. One day you're sporting clear skin, and the next, you're playing connect-the-dots with hyperpigmentation. Well, grab a coffee because I'm about to tell you about something that might just save your skincare routine (and your sanity) – the **VALITIC Kojic Acid Dark Spot Remover Soap Bars with Vitamin C**.

# What's All the Fuss About Kojic Acid Anyway?

Let's get real for a second – kojic acid sounds like something you'd find in a chemistry lab, right? But here's the thing: this little powerhouse ingredient has been quietly revolutionizing skincare for years. **Kojic acid naturally inhibits melanin production**, which is basically your skin's way of creating those stubborn dark spots we all love to hate.

I'll be honest, when I first heard about kojic acid, I was skeptical. Another ""miracle"" ingredient? Sure, Jan. But after doing my homework (and testing it myself), I discovered that kojic acid actually comes from fermented rice – the same process used to make sake. Who knew that ancient Japanese brewing techniques would become our modern-day skincare savior?

The VALITIC soap bars don't just throw kojic acid at your face and call it a day. They've **combined it with vitamin C**, creating what I like to call the dynamic duo of dark spot removal. Vitamin C brings its own brightening properties to the party, plus it helps stabilize the kojic acid for better results.

# Why Soap Bars Are Making a Comeback

Remember when everyone was obsessed with fancy serums and 12-step routines? Well, plot twist – sometimes the simplest solutions work best. **Soap bars are having a major moment**, and honestly, it's about time.

Here's why I'm totally here for the soap bar revival:

* **They're incredibly cost-effective** compared to those $$$ serums
* **Zero plastic waste** (Mother Earth says thanks)
* **Travel-friendly** without worrying about TSA liquid limits
* **Longer-lasting** than most liquid products

The VALITIC kojic acid soap bars take this old-school approach and give it a modern twist. You get all the benefits of active ingredients without the hefty price tag or complicated application process.

[Check out today's top deal on VALITIC Kojic Acid Soap Bars](https://amzn.to/4kCNnaG) – it's seriously worth grabbing while the price is this good!

# Breaking Down the Ingredient Powerhouse

Let's talk ingredients because, FYI, not all kojic acid products are created equal. The VALITIC formula doesn't mess around:

**Kojic Acid (2%)**: This is the star of the show. At 2% concentration, it's strong enough to be effective but gentle enough for daily use. I've seen some products go overboard with higher percentages, but trust me, more isn't always better when it comes to active ingredients.

**Vitamin C**: The perfect sidekick that brightens while kojic acid does the heavy lifting on melanin production. Together, they create a **one-two punch against hyperpigmentation**.

**Glycerin**: Keeps your skin from turning into the Sahara Desert while the active ingredients work their magic.

**Natural Oils**: These maintain your skin's moisture barrier because nobody wants to trade dark spots for flaky, irritated skin.

# Real Talk: What to Expect

Okay, let's manage expectations here. This isn't some magic eraser that'll make your dark spots disappear overnight (wouldn't that be nice though?). **Realistic results typically show up after 4-6 weeks of consistent use**.

Here's what I noticed during my testing period:

* **Week 1-2**: Skin felt cleaner, slightly brighter overall tone
* **Week 3-4**: Newer dark spots started fading noticeably
* **Week 5-8**: Older, more stubborn spots began lightening significantly

The key word here is **consistent**. You can't use it twice and expect miracles – skincare requires commitment, just like that gym membership you keep paying for but never use :)

# How to Use It Like a Pro

Using kojic acid soap isn't rocket science, but there are definitely some tricks to maximize results:

**Start Slow**: Begin with every other day to let your skin adjust. Kojic acid can be a bit intense if you dive in headfirst.

**Morning or Night**: I prefer using it in my evening routine because kojic acid can increase photosensitivity. Plus, who has time for a complicated morning routine anyway?

**Follow Up with SPF**: This is non-negotiable. **Kojic acid makes your skin more sensitive to UV rays**, so slather on that sunscreen like your skincare depends on it (because it does).

**Moisturize**: Don't skip this step. Active ingredients can be drying, and dry skin actually makes hyperpigmentation look worse.

# The Good, The Bad, and The Honest Truth

Let me give you the unfiltered breakdown because I believe in keeping it real:

**The Good:**

* **Affordable** compared to professional treatments
* **Gentle enough for sensitive skin** (when used properly)
* **Addresses multiple skin concerns** simultaneously
* **Easy to incorporate** into existing routines

**The Not-So-Good:**

* **Takes patience** – this isn't an instant fix
* **Can cause initial dryness** if you go overboard
* **Requires consistent sunscreen use** (though you should be doing this anyway)

**The Honest Truth**: This soap works, but it's not magic. You need realistic expectations and consistent use. If you're looking for overnight results, you might want to consider professional treatments instead.

# Who Should (and Shouldn't) Try This

**Perfect for:**

* People dealing with **post-acne marks**
* Those with **sun damage** or age spots
* Anyone wanting to **brighten overall skin tone**
* Budget-conscious skincare enthusiasts

**Maybe think twice if:**

* You have **extremely sensitive skin** (patch test first!)
* You're **pregnant or nursing** (always check with your doctor)
* You can't commit to **daily sunscreen use**

# Comparing Your Options

Look, I've tried my fair share of dark spot treatments, and here's where VALITIC stands in the lineup:

**vs. Expensive Serums**: You get similar active ingredients at a fraction of the cost. The trade-off? It takes a bit longer to see results, but your wallet will thank you.

**vs. Professional Treatments**: Obviously, dermatologist treatments work faster, but we're talking hundreds of dollars vs. under $20. IMO, trying this first makes total sense.

**vs. Other Kojic Acid Soaps**: The vitamin C addition really sets this apart. Most kojic acid soaps are one-trick ponies, but this combo approach gives you more bang for your buck.

# Final Thoughts: Is It Worth Your Money?

Here's my bottom line: **Yes, absolutely**. For the price point, you're getting a solid product with proven ingredients. Will it replace professional treatments for severe hyperpigmentation? Probably not. But for mild to moderate dark spots, this little soap bar punches way above its weight class.

The fact that it's a top deal today (May 29, 2025) makes it even more of a no-brainer. I mean, when's the last time you found an effective skincare product for less than your daily coffee budget?

Just remember – consistency is key, sunscreen is mandatory, and patience is a virtue. Your future self (with clearer, brighter skin) will definitely thank you for making the investment.

Two years ago, I lost the love of my life - and it was entirely my fault.

She was thriving. At just 28, nasa managerial position na siya, making 5x my salary. 

Meanwhile, I was stuck in a loop of job burnout and instability, jumping from one dead-end job to another every few months. I tried to make up for it - did all the chores, cooked for her, at palagi kong sinasabi na I just needed a little more time to get back on my feet.

She was patient. So patient. We had been together for 9 years. She hinted about marriage multiple times, about settling down. Pero paano ko pa siya ia-ask to marry me when I couldn't even afford my own life?

Eventually, she gave me an ultimatum: ""If you still can’t settle down or make any progress sa career mo at relasyon natin, I can’t keep waiting.""

I told her I was trying. She told me she was tired.

I still thought she’d stay.

And one night, I came home to find the apartment almost empty. No note. No goodbye. She left. I completely broke down. Threw things. Cried. Searched for her in the middle of the night. Her parents, her friends - everyone shut me out. I had been blocked everywhere.

I spiraled. Quit my job. Moved back in with my parents. I was unemployed for months and barely eating. My mom cried just watching me fall apart. I was at my absolute lowest.

A year passed. Slowly, I put myself back together. Rebuilt my resume. Studied like hell for interviews. Landed a high paying job. Started working insane hours just so I wouldn’t think about her.

And then - I saw her last week.

I was at a coffee shop, seated by the window. I saw her get out of an SUV - with a man. She was still beautiful. Still had that smile kung paano ko siya napapangiti dati. But now… she was wearing a ring.

Our eyes met. She froze for half a second… then looked away. Like I was a stranger.

She sat down at their table without even a nod.

And I just sat there, holding my coffee with shaking hands, trying not to cry in public.

She waited 9 years for me to grow up. I waited too long.

And just like that… it felt like I lost her all over again.",457,1748503500.0,OffMyChestPH,95,0.99,False

sweat dripping off your head,

breath hitching in your throat.

that someone will drag you into this basement

the one who you trust the most,

i call out his name and he is there in front of me.

with a metal rod,

The days that followed the incident in the south field were a blur of restless nights and sun-drenched, unsettling days. Caleb tried to dismiss the vision, to rationalize it as a heat-induced hallucination, a vivid dream born of exhaustion. But the cold dread lingered, a persistent whisper at the edge of his thoughts, and the world around him seemed to have shed a thin, comforting skin, revealing a raw, pulsing underbelly. The subtle hum he'd felt in the field now seemed to be a constant, low-frequency vibration deep within his bones, a resonance with something vast and unseen beneath the earth. The air, once merely humid, now carried a faint, almost imperceptible metallic tang, like the taste of old blood on the tongue, and the sunlight, though still bright, seemed to have lost its warmth, casting long, stark shadows that clung to everything.

His family noticed the change first, a slow, insidious erosion of the Caleb they knew. His mother, Martha, a woman whose gentle eyes missed nothing, began to watch him with a quiet, growing concern that etched new lines around her mouth. At dinner, where once Caleb would devour his meal with the hearty appetite of a farm boy, he now picked at his food, his gaze often distant, fixed on some unseen point beyond the window, as if listening to a conversation only he could hear.

""Caleb, you alright, honey?"" Martha asked one evening, her voice soft, laced with worry, as she reached across the table to touch his arm. ""You've barely touched your supper. And you've been so… quiet. Not like yourself.""

Silas grunted from across the table, his fork scraping against his plate, a sound that grated on Caleb's newly sensitive nerves. ""He's just tired, Martha. Long days in the sun. Right, son?"" He shot Caleb a questioning look, a silent plea for reassurance, for the familiar, easygoing boy to return.

Caleb merely grunted in response, pushing a piece of fried chicken around his plate with a fork. The smell, usually comforting, now seemed cloying, sickly sweet, like the scent of decay that had haunted him near the tractor. ""Yeah, just tired."" But his voice was sharper than usual, a brittle edge to it that made Martha flinch, her hand retracting as if burned.

His temper, once as predictable as the changing seasons, became volatile, erupting without warning, like summer lightning strikes from a clear sky. A misplaced tool, a stubborn cow refusing to be herded, even a simple question from his father could ignite a flash of disproportionate anger, a hot, buzzing current just beneath his skin that threatened to consume him. One afternoon, while trying to fix a jammed baler, the wrench slipped from his grasp, scraping his knuckles. With a guttural roar, a sound that seemed to tear from deep within him, Caleb kicked the side of the machine, leaving a deep, jagged dent in the worn metal.

Silas, who had been watching from a distance, walked over, his face grim, his usual patience worn thin. ""What in God's name, Caleb? You're gonna break something important. What's gotten into you? You're acting like a wild dog.""

Caleb spun around, his eyes blazing with an unfamiliar intensity, a cold, hard glint that Silas had never seen before. ""Nothing's gotten into me, Dad! Just this damn machine! It's fighting me! It's mocking me!"" His voice was loud, raw, almost a snarl, echoing unnaturally in the quiet barn.

Silas stared, his expression a mix of shock and dawning fear. He saw not just anger, but something darker, something almost predatory in his son's gaze. ""Son, that's not like you. You've always had a calm head, even when things went wrong. You been sleeping alright? You look… thinner. And your eyes…"" He trailed off, unable to articulate the unsettling depth he now saw there.

""I sleep fine!"" Caleb snapped, then immediately regretted the outburst. The words felt alien, not truly his own, as if another voice had spoken through him. He ran a hand through his hair, suddenly weary, the anger draining away to leave a hollow ache. ""Look, I'm sorry, Dad. Just… frustrated. This heat's getting to me.""

But the apology felt hollow, even to him. He could see the doubt in Silas's eyes, the way his father took a small, almost imperceptible step back, a subtle shift in their relationship that spoke volumes. The unspoken fear hung in the air between them, thick and suffocating.

His friends noticed it too. Billy Ray, Caleb's oldest friend, who worked at the gas station in town, saw it when Caleb came in for fuel. Billy Ray, all easy smiles and good-natured teasing, tried to joke with him, trying to bridge the growing chasm.

""Heard you almost took a bite out of that baler, Caleb,"" Billy Ray chuckled nervously, wiping his hands on a greasy rag. ""Martha told my mom you've been a regular bear lately. She's worried.""

Caleb's eyes narrowed, the dark glint returning. ""What's it to you, Billy Ray? And what's my mom telling your mom? Mind your own damn business."" His voice was low, laced with a menace that made Billy Ray take an involuntary step back.

Billy Ray's smile faltered, replaced by a look of genuine hurt, then a flicker of fear. ""Whoa, easy there, partner. Just trying to see if you're alright. Everyone's talking. You've been… different. Like a storm cloud hanging over you, and it's getting darker by the day.""

Caleb slammed his hand on the counter, making the coffee pot rattle violently. ""I'm fine! Just leave it!"" He paid for his gas, the bills crumpled in his fist, and stalked out, leaving Billy Ray staring after him, a worried frown etched on his face, the unspoken question hanging in the stale air of the gas station: What happened to Caleb?

Even Sarah, his childhood friend, a girl with eyes like summer sky and a laugh that could chase away any shadow, felt the shift. She saw him walking along the dusty road, head down, and pulled her old sedan over.

""Caleb! Hey, wait up!"" she called, her voice bright.

He stopped, but didn't turn fully, his shoulders hunched. When he finally looked at her, his eyes, usually warm and familiar, seemed distant, shadowed. ""Hey, Sarah."" His voice was flat, devoid of its usual warmth.

""You okay?"" she asked, her smile fading. ""You've been avoiding everyone. Billy Ray said you snapped at him.""

""I'm busy,"" Caleb mumbled, kicking at a loose stone. ""Got things to do.""

""Things more important than your friends?"" Her voice was soft, laced with disappointment. ""We're worried about you, Caleb. You look… haunted.""

He flinched at the word, a flicker of something akin to pain crossing his face, quickly masked by a hardening of his jaw. ""I'm fine, Sarah. Just leave me alone."" He turned and walked away, leaving her standing by the roadside, watching his retreating back, a profound sadness settling over her.

The anger was a new, unwelcome guest, a hot, buzzing current just beneath his skin, a constant companion. But beneath the anger, a different kind of obsession began to take root, consuming his thoughts, driving him. The vision. The Mohican elder. Atlantow. The words had burned themselves into his mind, a brand on his soul. He needed answers, not just to understand, but to grasp the threads of this new, terrifying reality.

That evening, instead of heading out for chores, Caleb found himself drawn to the small, dusty bookshelf in the living room. The air in the house felt heavier now, thick with unspoken anxieties, the old wood groaning softly as if under an invisible weight. He pulled out a thick, leather-bound volume on Native American folklore, its pages yellowed with age, brittle to the touch, and a few worn encyclopedias. He dragged a chair closer to the old standing lamp, its light casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and stretch with every movement.

He spent hours hunched over the book, his fingers tracing the faded print, his eyes stinging from the strain, but he couldn't stop. He scanned indices, flipped through chapters on various tribes, his mind a desperate sieve, sifting through ancient myths and forgotten legends. The more he read, the more the pieces of the puzzle began to click into place, forming a picture far more terrifying than he could have imagined. His mother came in once, offering him a slice of pie, her shadow falling over the pages like a shroud.

""Still at those books, honey?"" she asked, her voice gentle, but her eyes, he noticed, were wide with a concern she no longer bothered to hide. ""What's got you so interested in old stories, all of a sudden?""

""Just… history,"" Caleb mumbled, not looking up, his voice flat. ""Trying to understand something. Something important."" He felt a prickle of guilt at his evasiveness, a fleeting pang of the old Caleb, but he couldn't bring himself to speak of the skull, of the vision. It felt too fragile, too insane, too real to share.

Finally, deep into the night, the house silent save for the creaking of old timbers and the distant, almost imperceptible thrumming that was now a constant backdrop to his existence, he found it. A small, almost throwaway paragraph in a section on Algonquin and Iroquois beliefs, a footnote almost, easily overlooked by a less desperate eye. Some lesser-known traditions speak of a dark twin, a primordial force of anti-creation, often referred to as 'Atlantow' or 'Atahensic's Shadow', the embodiment of chaos and malevolence, banished to the underworld but destined to seek return when the world grows weak, when the balance is broken, and when the spirit of the land itself begins to sicken.

His breath hitched, a sharp, ragged sound in the quiet room. Atlantow. The name resonated with a chilling familiarity, echoing the elder's voice in his mind, a voice that now seemed to speak directly into his soul. Embodiment of chaos and malevolence. It fit. Too perfectly. The strange weather, the dying birds, the unsettling hum, the sickly sweet scent, the silence of Harmony Creek – they were not random. They were not just signs. They were symptoms. The world was growing weak.

He reread the paragraph, his heart pounding, a frantic drum against his ribs. The world growing weak. Was that what was happening to Harmony Creek? To the land itself? Was this why the crops seemed to struggle, why the animals were listless, why the very air felt heavy with an unseen presence? And the skull… the elongated, crystalline skull. It couldn't be just a coincidence. It had to be his. Atlantow's. The vessel, or perhaps the key, to his return.

A cold certainty settled over him, displacing the confusion and fear, replacing it with something darker, more resolute. He had found it. The skull of a banished god. And for a fleeting, terrifying moment, a dark, exhilarating power seemed to pulse within him, a resonance with the chaos he had just read about, a strange, seductive kinship with the unmaking. The dread was still there, but it was mingled now with a perverse sense of understanding, of belonging to this unfolding horror. He felt a profound connection to the dark forces stirring beneath the earth, a recognition that both terrified and thrilled him. He closed the book, the ancient words still burning in his mind, the image of the shimmering crystal skull seared behind his eyelids. The crystal skull was gone, but its presence, its essence, was now undeniably a part of him, a dark seed planted deep within his being. And as he finally pushed himself away from the table, the old farmhouse seemed to groan around him, a living thing aware of the dark knowledge that had just been unearthed within its walls, and within the soul of its youngest inhabitant. The harvest was coming, and Caleb, no longer oblivious, felt the first, chilling stirrings of its true, monstrous nature within his own transformed spirit. Harmony Creek, once a haven of rural simplicity, was now a stage for an ancient, unspeakable horror, and Caleb, the farmer's son, was no longer just an observer, but a player, perhaps even a pawn, in a game he was only just beginning to understand.



Chapter 4: The Hunger Awakens

Harmony Creek, once a tapestry woven with the predictable threads of rural life, began to unravel with terrifying speed. The subtle omens of days past had blossomed into blatant, horrifying realities. The air, once merely humid, now tasted of ozone and a sickly sweetness that clung to the back of the throat. The sun, a malevolent eye in the sky, beat down with a heat that seemed to drain the very color from the landscape, leaving everything bleached and brittle. The familiar hum of farm machinery was increasingly drowned out by a deeper, more pervasive thrumming that seemed to emanate from the very bedrock of the town, a low, resonant vibration that set teeth on edge and frayed nerves.

The first whispers of true panic began with the pets. Old Mrs. Gable’s prize-winning tabby, Mittens, vanished without a trace, leaving only a faint, coppery stain on the porch swing. Then came Mr. Miller’s hound dog, Buster, found stiff and cold in his kennel, his eyes wide and staring, as if he’d seen something too terrible to comprehend, a silent scream frozen in their depths. Children cried themselves to sleep, clutching empty leashes, their innocent grief a new, bitter note in the town's growing symphony of despair. The adults exchanged grim, knowing glances, their forced smiles cracking under the strain, revealing the raw fear beneath.

""It's the coyotes,"" Silas insisted to Martha one morning, his voice lacking conviction as he stared out at their own silent barn, where their old barn cat, Whiskers, had not appeared for her morning milk. ""Or maybe a rabid fox. They're getting bolder with the heat.""

Martha merely wrung her hands, her gaze fixed on the empty cat bowl, her lips a thin, pale line. ""We've never had this many disappearances, Silas. Not like this. And the way Buster looked… like he was scared to death. And what about the Wilsons' chickens? All twenty of them, just… gone. No feathers, no blood, just empty coop.""

The crops, the very heart of Harmony Creek, began to die overnight. Fields that had been vibrant green in the evening light would wake to a sickly, mottled brown, the stalks shriveled and brittle, as if an invisible fire had swept through them, consuming their very life force. The corn, once tall and proud, now hung limp and yellow, its kernels blackening to a powdery ash that crumbled to dust at the slightest touch. The tobacco leaves, once broad and lush, curled inward, their veins pulsing with that same unsettling violet Caleb had seen, before they withered entirely, leaving behind skeletal husks. Farmers walked their ruined land with faces etched in despair, their hands clenching into useless fists, the dust of their failed harvests clinging to their clothes like a shroud.

""It's the blight,"" they muttered to each other in hushed tones at the general store, their voices thin with a desperate hope for a familiar enemy. But their eyes told a different story. This was no blight. This was something deeper, more fundamental, a rot that began not on the surface, but from within the very earth.

Then came the cattle. A low, mournful sound, a collective groan, began to emanate from the pastures, a sound that carried on the heavy air like a dirge. Cows stood listless, their eyes glazed with a milky film, their hides covered in strange, weeping sores that pulsed with a faint, greenish light, like phosphorescent fungi. Their milk dried up, their meat wasted away, and soon, their massive bodies began to drop, bloating rapidly, their stench a new, sickening layer to the already fouled air, drawing flies that buzzed with an unnatural, almost frantic hunger.

""My prize bull, Goliath,"" old man Hemlock wept to Silas, his voice broken, leaning heavily on his fence post, his eyes red-rimmed. ""Just dropped. No warning. Never seen anything like it. It's like the land itself is turning against us. Like it's… angry.""

Silas could only nod, his own stomach churning with a cold dread. Their youngest calf had been found that morning, twisted into an impossible shape, its eyes wide and vacant, its small body already beginning to decompose with unnatural speed. He looked at his son, Caleb, who stood beside him, his face impassive, almost detached, watching the dying cattle with an unnerving stillness, a faint, almost imperceptible smile playing on his lips.

The Harmony River, once the town's lifeblood, became a poisoned artery. The fish, usually leaping silver in the morning sun, now floated belly-up, their scales dull, their eyes cloudy, their bodies bloated and putrid, a grotesque harvest of death. The water itself turned thick and dark, a viscous, oily black that reflected the bruised sky like a mirror of despair. A foul, metallic odor, like rust and stagnant blood, rose from its depths, making the air around it unbreathable, a constant reminder of the unseen corruption.

""We can't drink this,"" Martha declared, holding a glass of tap water to the light. It was murky, with dark, swirling particulates that seemed to writhe, and smelled like a shallow grave, or something long dead and forgotten. ""It's… it's putrid. We'll have to buy water from the Co-op. If they even have any left.""

The Co-op, usually a place of community and idle chatter, became a grim battleground. Families, their faces drawn and haggard, jostled for the few remaining cases of bottled water, their desperation a palpable thing, a raw, animalistic fear. The cost soared, draining meager savings, adding another layer of crushing anxiety to their already burdened lives. Arguments erupted, voices frayed and raw, and once-friendly neighbors eyed each other with suspicion, their bonds fraying under the relentless pressure.

Through it all, Caleb moved with an unsettling calm, an almost predatory grace. His aggression, once sporadic, now simmered beneath the surface, a constant, low thrum, like a coiled snake. He rarely spoke, and when he did, his voice held a new, deeper resonance, a subtle echo that wasn't quite his own, a whisper of ancient power. His eyes, once the familiar blue of the summer sky, now seemed darker, holding a depth that was both ancient and utterly cold, like pools reflecting a starless void. He watched the suffering of Harmony Creek, not with despair, but with a detached, almost scientific interest, a flicker of something akin to satisfaction in their depths.

Hushed conversations began to follow Caleb like his shadow.

""Did you see the Miller's prize rose bushes?"" Old Mrs. Gable whispered to her neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, at the church bake sale, her voice barely audible above the strained murmurs of the few attendees. ""Caleb walked past their yard yesterday, just before sunset. This morning, every single bloom was shriveled black. Like they were burned from the inside.""

Mrs. Henderson nodded, her eyes wide with a fearful understanding. ""And the Hemlocks' well dried up the day after he helped Silas fix that fence near their property. Just went bone dry. Never happened before.""

At the gas station, Billy Ray, his face pale and drawn, spoke in low tones to a farmer from the next county over. ""It's Caleb. I swear it. Every time he goes somewhere, something bad happens. He was at the hardware store, and the next day, Mr. Miller's dog… and then the river started turning. He visited the south field, and now the corn's all dead."" He shivered, despite the oppressive heat. ""He ain't right, something's… wrong with him.""

The farmer, a burly man named Jebediah, scoffed, but his eyes darted nervously towards the road. ""That's just talk, Billy Ray. Caleb's a good kid. Just going through a rough patch, like all of us."" But even as he spoke, his gaze lingered on the dust cloud kicked up by Caleb's pickup as it disappeared down the road, heading towards the north fields, where the tobacco crop was still inexplicably green.

One night, the air in Caleb's room was thick with the metallic tang he now recognized as the scent of Atlantow, a scent that was becoming increasingly potent, intoxicating. The low hum in his bones had intensified, a vibrant, almost painful vibration, a symphony of awakening power. He walked to the old, cracked mirror on his dresser, its surface a pale, indistinct blur in the dim light of the single bulb. He raised a hand, tracing the outline of his face, and as he did, a faint, phosphorescent green light began to emanate from within him.

It started in his fingertips, a soft, ethereal glow, then spread, creeping up his arm, across his chest, outlining his ribs, his spine, his elongated skull. The light intensified, burning brighter, consuming the flesh, until his entire skeleton was visible beneath his skin, a glowing lattice of green bone, pulsating with an unholy energy that seemed to hum with a terrible, ancient song. He stared at the impossible sight, not with horror, but with a profound, chilling recognition. This was his true form, or at least, a glimpse of it.

It is time, a voice whispered, not in his ears, but in the very marrow of his glowing bones, a voice that was both his own and something infinitely more. It was deeper, colder, infinitely older, a voice that had echoed in the void before creation. The charade has served its purpose. The shell is nearly ready to be shed.

The reflection in the mirror shifted. The eyes, once Caleb's, now burned with a malevolent, ancient intelligence, twin emeralds of pure, concentrated evil. The faint tremor in his hands was gone, replaced by a steady, unwavering power that thrummed through his very being. The confusion, the guilt, the fleeting pangs of the old Caleb—all were gone, burned away by the incandescent light, consumed by the awakening entity.

I am Atlantow, the voice resonated, filling the room, filling the farmhouse, filling the very air of Harmony Creek. I have walked in his skin, tasted his fear, learned his pathetic human ways. He was a suitable vessel, a useful shell. A perfect disguise for the long sleep, for the slow, insidious gathering of power.

A slow, terrible smile stretched across the reflected face, a smile that held no warmth, only a vast, cosmic hunger, a promise of utter annihilation. The suffering… the despair… it is a symphony, a feast. Each lost pet, each withered crop, each dying beast, each drop of putrid water… they are offerings, rich and potent. Each soul that cracks under the strain, each heart that breaks, each mind that descends into madness… they are fuel. They are the essence I consume to regain my strength.

The green light pulsed, brighter still, and the hum in the room became a roar, a vibration that shook the very foundations of the farmhouse, making the floorboards tremble and the windows rattle in their frames. Soon. Soon I shall shed this skin. Soon I shall be whole. The harvest is almost complete. And Harmony Creek, sweet Harmony Creek, will be the crucible of my rebirth, the first taste of a world remade in my image.

The light faded, leaving only the familiar reflection of Caleb, but the eyes were wrong. They held the cold, ancient fire of a banished god, a being of pure chaos awakened. Caleb was gone. The boy who had worried about irrigation lines and argued with his father was merely a memory, a husk, a forgotten dream. Atlantow had been acting, learning, observing. And now, the lesson was over. The hunger was awake. And Harmony Creek, unaware of the true horror in its midst, was bleeding out its very essence, feeding the monstrous entity that walked among them, wearing the face of a farmer's son. The final harvest was at hand, and it would be a harvest of unimaginable terror.",1,1748502514.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Caleb was a creature of habit, as rooted to the soil of Harmony Creek as the cornstalks that stretched like skeletal fingers towards the indifferent summer sky. Eighteen years had etched the contours of this land into his soul: the smell of damp earth after a rain, the rhythmic drone of the combine in late August, the distant, mournful lowing of cattle. Harmony Creek wasn't much more than a crossroads, a blink-and-you-miss-it collection of weathered clapboard houses, a single general store that smelled perpetually of feed and stale coffee, and a church whose steeple leaned precariously, as if perpetually bowing to the vast, open sky. The town's lifeblood was the land, flat and fertile, stretching for miles in every direction, interrupted only by the occasional stand of ancient oaks or the meandering, sluggish flow of the Harmony River, its banks choked with willow and cattail. Generations of farmers had tilled this earth, their lives a slow, deliberate dance with the seasons, and Caleb was no different.

His mornings began before dawn, a ritual of coffee black as tar and the clatter of work boots on the porch, followed by the familiar grind of farm chores. This particular Tuesday, the air hung thick and humid, promising another scorching day. As he stepped into the kitchen, his father, Silas, a man whose face was a roadmap of sun-baked wrinkles, was already at the stove, flipping pancakes.

""Morning, boy,"" Silas grunted, his voice raspy with sleep and years of shouting over machinery. ""Looks like a scorcher. Got those irrigation lines checked on the north field?""

""First thing, Dad,"" Caleb replied, pouring himself a mug of coffee. His gaze, usually sharp for kinks or leaks, snagged on something unusual as he stared out the window towards the dew-kissed fields. The dew, usually a clear, crystalline sheen on the broad leaves of the tobacco plants, shimmered with an odd, almost oily iridescence. It wasn't the rainbow play of light on water; it was a deeper, more unsettling spectrum, like spilled gasoline on a puddle, but alive, pulsing with faint, unidentifiable colors. He blinked, rubbed his eyes.

""Something wrong with the crop already?"" Silas asked, noticing Caleb's fixed stare.

""Nah, just the light,"" Caleb muttered, shrugging it off. ""Or maybe old man Hemlock's fertilizer got a bit… extra this year. Looks kinda weird."" He didn't elaborate, already dismissing the fleeting anomaly. His mind was already on the broken pump at the far end of the row, a more tangible problem.

He spent the morning out in the north field, the sun already beating down with a relentless intensity. The air, usually alive with the hum of insects and the distant caw of crows, felt strangely muted. While mending a fence near the old oak grove, a sudden, unnatural silence descended. The cicadas, usually a deafening chorus, ceased their song mid-stridulation. The wind, which had been rustling through the dry leaves, died abruptly, leaving the air heavy and still. Caleb paused, hammer mid-swing, and looked up. A flock of starlings, hundreds strong, had been wheeling overhead, a dark, fluid cloud against the pale sky. Now, they simply stopped. Not landed, not dispersed, but stopped, hanging motionless for a beat, like a photograph. Then, as one, they plummeted. Not in a graceful dive, but as if struck by an invisible fist, a rain of small, feathered bodies thudding into the field around him.

A shiver, brief and unwelcome, traced its way down Caleb's spine. He watched, a faint frown creasing his brow. ""Damn birds,"" he grumbled, resuming his hammering with a renewed vigor that belied the slight unease. ""Must've flown into a power line. Happens."" He didn't see the few that twitched on the ground, their tiny claws flexing, their eyes, even in death, seeming to hold a spark of something utterly alien. He certainly didn't notice the way the oak leaves, usually a vibrant green, seemed to darken, their veins pulsing with a faint, almost imperceptible violet, as if something unseen was drawing life from them.

Around noon, Caleb drove his beat-up pickup into Harmony Creek for some spare parts at Miller's Hardware. The main street, a dusty ribbon of asphalt, was quiet, the usual midday bustle absent. Old Mrs. Gable wasn't on her porch swing, and the usual gaggle of kids wasn't playing by the dry fountain in the town square. Inside Miller's, the air was cool and smelled of sawdust and grease. Mr. Miller, a man whose glasses perpetually slid down his nose, was polishing a wrench with a slow, methodical motion.

""Hot one, ain't it, Caleb?"" Miller mumbled, not looking up.

""Sure is, Mr. Miller. Need a new gasket for the irrigation pump."" Caleb leaned against the counter. ""Seems awful quiet today. Where's everyone?""

Miller finally looked up, his eyes, usually twinkling with good humor, seemed shadowed. ""Folks are keeping to themselves, I reckon. Heard some strange things out east, near the old abandoned mill. Dogs barking all night, then nothing. Just… nothing."" He paused, then added, almost to himself, ""And the air… feels different, don't it? Like something's holding its breath.""

Caleb just nodded, already thinking about the pump. ""Probably just the heat getting to folks. Makes everyone jumpy."" He picked up his gasket. ""Well, thanks, Mr. Miller. See ya."" He paid and left, dismissing Miller's vague unease as an old man's fancy. He didn't notice the faint, almost imperceptible tremor that ran through the floorboards of the hardware store as he stepped out, or the way the shadows in the alley across the street seemed to deepen, becoming more than just an absence of light.

As evening approached, the heat of the day lingered, oppressive and unyielding. Caleb was hosing down the tractor, the metallic tang of oil and dust filling his nostrils. But beneath it, a new scent began to unfurl, subtle at first, then growing more pronounced. It was sweet, cloying, like overripe fruit left too long in the sun, but with an undercurrent of something metallic, coppery, like blood. It was the smell of decay, but a decay that was somehow… wrong. Too rich, too vibrant, almost alive. He sniffed, wrinkling his nose. ""Dad probably left that sack of rotten potatoes out again,"" he mumbled, though he knew his father was meticulous about waste, especially with anything that could draw pests. He ignored the way the water from the hose, usually clear, seemed to catch the last rays of the setting sun with a faint, reddish tint, like diluted wine, as it splashed against the dusty metal.

The sky, as the sun dipped below the horizon, was a canvas of bruised purples and angry oranges, a common enough sight in a farming town. But tonight, there was a single cloud, low and slow, that defied explanation. It wasn't a storm cloud, nor a dust cloud. It was too perfectly spherical, too dark, a hole punched in the fading light. And from its center, a sound began to emanate. A low, sustained thrumming, like a colossal insect trapped within the earth, or the distant, grinding gears of some impossible machine. It vibrated in Caleb's teeth, resonated in his bones, a deep bass note that seemed to shake the very foundations of the farm.

Silas stepped out onto the porch, wiping his hands on a rag. ""You hear that, boy?"" he called out, his voice a little strained. ""Sounds like… like a swarm of angry bees, but bigger. Much bigger.""

Caleb paused, the hose still running, and stared up at the impossible cloud. ""Sounds like old man Peterson's combine,"" he mused, though Peterson lived five miles away and his combine was notoriously quiet, let alone capable of producing such a resonant, earth-shaking hum. He shook his head, dismissing the deep, resonant hum that seemed to be pulling at the very fabric of the air, making the leaves on the trees shiver without a breeze. ""Probably just the wind playing tricks, Dad. Or maybe some new kind of military plane.""

He finished cleaning the tractor, the strange thrumming fading into the background of his tired mind, becoming just another part of the evening's ambient noise. As he walked back towards the house, the last vestiges of twilight painted the fields in shades of charcoal and indigo. He passed the old well, its stone rim worn smooth by generations of hands. A faint, almost imperceptible glow emanated from its depths, a soft, phosphorescent green, like something glimpsed in the deepest ocean, or the fungal bloom on ancient, forgotten things. And then, just for a moment, a ripple. Not of water, but of the air itself, above the well, distorting the stars into swirling streaks of light. It was as if the very fabric of reality had shivered, a momentary tear in the veil.

Caleb glanced over, his eyes heavy-lidded with fatigue. ""Huh,"" he mumbled, rubbing his neck. ""Must be the heat making the air wavy."" He yawned, a vast, unconcerned sound, and pushed open the screen door, the smell of his mother's cooking—fried chicken and collard greens—a comforting anchor in the gathering darkness. He didn't see the way the green light from the well intensified for a moment, casting long, writhing shadows that seemed to reach out, hungry, towards the unsuspecting farmhouse. He didn't feel the subtle tremor that ran through the ground beneath his feet, a tremor that promised a harvest far more terrible than any he had ever known. And as he sat down to dinner, he didn't notice the faint, almost imperceptible shimmer in his mother's eyes, or the way his father's hands, usually steady, trembled ever so slightly as he reached for the salt. Harmony Creek was holding its breath, and Caleb, oblivious, was breathing right through it.



Chapter 2: The Earth's Secret

The next morning, the air still hung heavy, but a faint, metallic tang had joined the usual scent of damp earth, like distant lightning before a storm. The sky was a hazy, unblinking eye, promising another day of relentless heat. Caleb, still feeling the lingering fatigue of the previous day's chores, was out in the newly plowed south field, a vast expanse of rich, dark soil turned over like pages in a forgotten book. The furrows stretched in perfectly straight lines, a testament to Silas's meticulous work, but also a stark, open wound in the familiar landscape. His task was to clear the larger stones that the plow had unearthed, a tedious but necessary chore before planting. Each swing of the shovel was a familiar rhythm, a dull ache in his shoulders, but a rhythm he knew by heart.

He plunged his shovel into the earth, the blade biting deep with a satisfying crunch, and levered up a heavy clod. The soil, dark and moist, clung stubbornly to the roots of weeds and fragments of last year's stalks. As the clod broke apart with a soft, crumbling sound, something pale and unsettling rolled free. It wasn't a stone.

Caleb froze, his breath catching in his throat. He blinked, wiping his brow with the back of his hand, trying to dislodge the sweat that stung his eyes. It looked like a skull. Human, or at least, recognizably humanoid. But it was wrong. Terribly wrong. The cranium was elongated, stretching back into a smooth, almost elegant curve, far beyond the natural confines of a human head. It was the color of old bone, a dusty, muted grey, and where the eye sockets should have been, there were only smooth, vacant hollows, like eroded caves, staring up at the indifferent sun. There was no jaw, no teeth, just the unsettling, alien curve of the cranium.

""Well, I'll be,"" Caleb muttered, a flicker of genuine curiosity, rare for him, stirring in his chest. This wasn't just a strange rock or a forgotten animal carcass. This was different. He knelt, his knees sinking slightly into the soft earth, and brushed away the clinging soil with a tentative hand. ""What in tarnation…?""

He reached out, his fingers hesitant, almost reverent, and nudged the skull. As he did, the grey, bone-like surface crumbled, dissolving into a fine, almost invisible dust that drifted away on the faintest whisper of a breeze, like a forgotten dream. Beneath the illusion of decay, something else was revealed. The skull wasn't bone at all. It was flawlessly clear, like a piece of ancient ice, or a perfectly cut crystal, yet it held the delicate, intricate structure of a living thing. It shimmered in the harsh sunlight, catching the light and refracting it into a thousand tiny, dancing rainbows that pulsed with an internal, ethereal glow, as if a trapped star resided within its translucent depths.

As his fingers made full contact with the smooth, cool surface of the crystal, a jolt, not of electricity, but of pure, raw sensation, shot through him. It was as if his very consciousness was being yanked, violently, from his body. The world around him dissolved. The sun, the field, the distant farmhouse—all vanished, replaced by a swirling vortex of color and sound, a maelstrom of sensory input that threatened to overwhelm him.

He was no longer in Harmony Creek. He stood on a high bluff overlooking a vast, primeval forest, the air crisp and smelling of pine and woodsmoke, a scent so real it made his nostrils flare. Before him, gathered around a roaring fire whose flames danced with an impossible, vibrant intensity, were figures clad in deerskin and feathers, their faces painted with ochre and charcoal. Mohicans. He knew them from the history books, but this was no dusty image, no faded photograph. This was real. He could feel the warmth of the fire on his skin, hear the crackle of burning wood, the low murmur of their voices, like the rustling of ancient leaves. The faces were indistinct, shifting like smoke, yet their presence was undeniable.

An elder, his face a web of ancient lines that seemed to shift and reform, rose and spoke. His words echoed not in Caleb's ears, but directly in his mind, a language older than time, yet perfectly understood, as if it had always resided within him. The words were not spoken, but felt, a current of meaning flowing through his very being.

""The Great Spirit, our Creator, brought forth all life,"" the elder intoned, his voice resonant with sorrow and fear, yet also with a deep, weary wisdom. ""He spun the stars, breathed life into the rivers, shaped the mountains from the earth's bone. But from His shadow, from the void that was before all things, came Atlantow. The Twin. The Deceiver. He who seeks to unmake. He who hungers for the light, for the very essence of creation.""

The scene flickered, the fire momentarily dissolving into a cascade of black ash before reforming. Another warrior, younger, but with eyes that held a profound weariness that belied his youth, stepped forward. His form seemed to ripple, as if seen through heat haze. ""Atlantow, the dark brother, was banished. His essence scattered, his power bound beneath the earth, sealed by the Creator's own hand. But the earth remembers. The earth suffers. And the signs… the signs are upon us. The waters sicken, turning black like old blood. The creatures fall, their bodies twisted, their cries unheard. The sky weeps strange colors, and the air itself grows heavy with a breath not our own.""

Caleb felt a cold dread bloom in his stomach, a chilling recognition. The words, the descriptions, mirrored the strange occurrences in Harmony Creek, the very things he had so easily dismissed. The oily dew, the plummeting birds, the sweet, metallic scent, the thrumming cloud. They weren't isolated oddities; they were symptoms.

""His return is foretold,"" the elder continued, his gaze sweeping over the assembled tribe, their faces now indistinct blurs of fear and resignation, then seeming to pierce directly into Caleb's very being, a gaze that saw not just him, but the land he stood upon. ""When the veil between worlds thins, when the land itself groans with the weight of forgotten things, when the harvests fail and the seasons turn against themselves, Atlantow will stir. His hunger will grow. And the harvest… the harvest will be of souls, of essence, of all that lives and breathes.""

The scene intensified, becoming a terrifying kaleidoscope. The firelight pulsed, intensifying into an unbearable glare, then receding into an inky blackness. The faces of the Mohican warriors twisted, their expressions morphing into masks of pure, primal terror and despair, their silent screams echoing in the void of Caleb's mind. The vast forest around them seemed to writhe, the trees bleeding black, viscous sap, their branches reaching like skeletal arms, clawing at the sky. The ground beneath him buckled, opening into fissures that glowed with an internal, malevolent light. The elder’s voice, now a desperate, fragmented whisper, clawed at Caleb's mind, a broken plea: ""He comes for the heart of the land… for the heart of the harvest… for the blood of the earth… for you…""

With a violent, wrenching lurch, Caleb was back in the south field, gasping, his hands still outstretched, hovering over the spot where the skull had been. The sun beat down, hot and real, but its light seemed harsher, more unforgiving. The clod of earth lay broken, just as it had been. But the crystal skull was gone. Vanished. There was no trace of it, not even a faint impression in the disturbed soil, as if it had never existed, a phantom of the earth.

He scrambled to his feet, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird, each beat a painful thrum. The vision had been so vivid, so real, yet so utterly impossible. The fear, the words, the chilling prophecy of Atlantow. He looked around, disoriented, the familiar landscape suddenly alien, imbued with a new, terrifying significance. Had he imagined it? Was it the heat? A momentary sunstroke, a waking nightmare brought on by exhaustion?

He stumbled back towards the farmhouse, his shovel dragging uselessly behind him. His father, Silas, was just coming out of the barn, wiping grease from his hands with a rag.

""Everything alright, boy?"" Silas called out, his brow furrowed with concern. ""You look like you've seen a ghost.""

Caleb stopped, unable to meet his father's gaze. How could he explain? How could he put words to the impossible, to the ancient horror that had just unfolded in his mind? ""Just… just the heat, Dad,"" he stammered, his voice rough. ""Got a bit lightheaded.""

Silas walked over, placing a hand on Caleb's shoulder. His touch was firm, familiar, but Caleb felt a strange disconnect, as if a thin, invisible barrier now separated them. ""You push yourself too hard, son. Go on, get some water. And maybe a rest before lunch.""

Caleb nodded, grateful for the dismissal. He walked towards the pump, his mind reeling. He shook his head, trying to clear the lingering images, the elder's desperate whisper. But something had changed. The air still felt thick and humid, but now, beneath it, he perceived a faint, almost imperceptible hum, like a distant, powerful engine, deeper and more resonant than the one from last night, a hum that seemed to emanate from the very core of the earth. The silence of the field, usually just the absence of sound, now felt like a presence, a watchful stillness, as if the land itself was holding its breath, waiting. And when he looked at his hands, calloused and dirt-stained, they seemed… different. Not physically, but as if a faint, almost imperceptible tremor ran through them, a resonance with something vast and ancient that had just touched his soul. He didn't understand it, couldn't articulate it, but a fragile thread of awareness had been woven into the fabric of his obliviousness. He was no longer just Caleb, the farmer's son. He was… something more. Something connected. He still didn't know what it meant, or what to do with it, but the world, Harmony Creek, had just shown him a glimpse of its true, terrifying face. And though he tried to dismiss it, the cold dread, the knowledge of Atlantow, lingered like a phantom limb, a chilling new addition to the landscape of his mind, a seed planted in the fertile ground of his fear.

I’ve been living in Hobart for about three years and work as a doctor in the CBD. Some days can be a bit much, and I’m on the lookout for a quiet spot to go after work — somewhere I can park the car, sit for a while, and just unwind. A nice view would be perfect. I’d love to be able to listen to music, maybe read a bit, go for a little walk, or just sit and breathe (possibly cry, ideally not sobbing in public though).

I used to go to Tolosa Park, but it closes early in winter and I usually finish around 4 or 5. Open to suggestions anywhere around Hobart or even out towards Bridgewater — especially places where it’s okay to just stay in the car and soak in the surroundings.

And if you know any spots where I can grab a late arvo coffee or a sweet treat on the way to this magical place (aside from Maccas or Hill Street), I’d be forever grateful 🍰☕

Ive never been this heavy and it was a shock. I travel frequently for work and have severe needle anxiety (I passed out when I saw my recent IV in my hand for surgery) so I had concerns about injections while on the go.
----
I read the beginners guide and it helped, thank you redditers!
Every individuals journey is specific to them but in case it helps ease some fears, recapping my 1st full week of 2.5mg.

1. Supplies and preparing your space.
Get your stuff (better foods, protein shakes, tums, etc) BEFORE you start. The beginners guide linked a free caps container and I ordered it 2 weeks ago, and it just arrived tonight right on time for my 2nd injection. I however delayed getting my tums and fiber gummies until the day after my first dose and felt like crap. Walking through costco was torture. By afternoon of this first full day, I felt notably fatigued so I drank extra electrolytes and skipped my workouts. I had nausea, heartburn, and burps for about 2 full days. Some comments mention injection site variances with side effects so I'll see. First shot was left abs and 2nd was right arm.

2. Listening to your body may look and feel a lot more different suddenly. The foods I enjoyed didn't sound good, taste or even smell good anymore WTF.
I ended up making a lot of this 5 ingredient 40g protein smoothie I came up with: vanilla protein powder, frozen berries, yogurt, spinach, almond milk. Forcing myself to eat was also a new first. Liquids like the beginner guide suggested, indeed were easier to tolerate.
Energy / sleep has been weird. I've noticed I'm waking up fully awake without feeling like my body needs coffee. On the flip side I don't feel like I've slept as solid, waking up throughout the night a few nights. Ive skipped coffee 3 days and been fine. 

3. Food relationships are fucked. This medication has already helped me rebuild an unhealthy crutch I'd developed with food. If I can only eat 5 bites of something at a time but still need to hit my protein and veggie goals, I prioritize those macros first before any cookie or treat now. Sugar no longer sends me into a craving spiral which is wild. Now my brain has time to think about better things! Also- People don't like it when I refuse food in social situations. I don't understand the harm in saying I'm literally not hungry and no I don't want just a bite, and just moving on. Refusing food and moreso others reactions was possibly the most surprising in the last week...or a close tie with not realizing how much food chatter I actually had until it suddenly disappeared a week ago.

Although I am still sus on the numbers since I was clothed the first time and a different scale, I've dropped 9 pounds in a week, and even if just one of those pounds is legit, I am still highly motivated to keep moving toward my 50lb goal.

I've got my shotsy app, water and LMNT, so bring it on, week 2! ",2,1748501970.0,Zepbound,2,1.0,False

*Background information*

I was introduced into the world of filter coffee two years ago. It all started with a Hario V60 and a Hario Skerton (please do not roast). I stopped using the Skerton after a month because of how inconsistent it is. Because I did not immediately want to buy another grinder, I always have my beans grounded at the coffee shop. I've tried all different sorts of coffee but my preference really lies with light roast, fruity / floral coffee.

*Research for grinder*

Because I only drink filter coffee (V60 and Aeropress) I wanted to look for a filter-only grinder. I intend to buy an espresso machine in the future, but for now I am in the market for a filter coffee grinder. I've scoured the internet and the grinder that I saw the most was the Fellow ODE gen 2. It seemed very appealing at first and I almost bought the grinder. Then I came across the Timemore Sculptor series (I saw a video of Lance Hedrick in which he said that he preferred the Timemore to the ODE). It was quite a big jump in price so I was not sure what to do. Finally I decided to go for the ODE because Lance said that the ODE may be the best filter-only grinder for diminishing returns.

After some more research I realized that handgrinders may have a higher value proposition than electric grinder, which makes total sense if you look at materials used and needed to grind the beans. Now the real challenge started and a entire new world opened to me: handgrinder vs. electric grinder.

*Handgrinder*

To keep the story on the short side. I've looked at basically every tier list and review video for handgrinders. My choice ultimately falls to the K-ultra or the ZP6. However, I cannot make a choice. It seems that the ZP6 is put on a pedestal for being the best filter handgrinder. To me it seems that the ZP6 perfectly caters to my taste profile and I actually really want to buy the ZP6. That said, I've also read numerous posts saying that you should not buy the ZP6 as your first grinder. Therefore, the K-ultra may be the better choice because it gives a more blended cup.

Could you share your opinion with me. To reiterate, I strongly prefer light roast floral / fruity coffee and intend to buy freshly roasted beans from a good coffeeshop. My dilemma stems from the fact that my household also likes darker roasted coffee and I heard that the ZP6 might not be the best option for that. In addition, the ZP6 seems to reach higher highs, but also higher lows. The range of how good the coffee will taste therefore varies a lot more than let's say the K-ultra. I think i suffer from analysis paralysis. Hit me up.

I’m a 34-year-old guy, 186cm tall, and I started my weight loss journey at the beginning of February 2025 at 138kg. As of now, I'm just under 108kg. 

Originally, my goal was simple: get the number on the scale down from three digits to two. Now that I’m within reach of that, my focus has shifted. I want to see what my body is truly capable of over the next 12–18 months. I've always been a “big lad” so now I want to explore the other end of the spectrum and really transform my physique.

**What I'm Currently Doing:**

* No calorie counting. Just focusing on eating whole, high-quality foods while avoiding sugar, junk food, and sugary drinks.
* 18 hours fast from dinner until lunch (6pm-12pm, basically skipping breakfast aside from coffee).
* I’m not on any supplements, vitamins, or enhancers (Pre-work, creatine, etc).
* I train solo, no personal trainer.
* Daily workouts: minimum 60 mins, with a focus on elevated walks (30 mins) + a mix of bodyweight and functional exercises.
* Specific focus on legs and hips for strength and flexibility (Had crunchy, sore knees, which are now improving).
* Recently started incorporating some light running (About 3 runs per week) — I'd love to build up to running a marathon.  

**Where I’m Looking for Help:**

Despite my progress, I know my current training lacks direction. There's effort and consistency, but not enough purpose or structure.

I’d love advice on:

* **How to optimize my training** to keep cutting fat while introducing proper strength and muscle-building routines.
* **Running and endurance** — how to safely increase mileage and improve performance.
* **Nutrition & supplements** — what should I be taking (if anything)? Should I start tracking macros? What are good resources for learning?
* **Calorie counting** — how to approach it effectively and actually understand what my body needs.
* **Cutting, bulking, body re**\-**composition** — this stuff is all a mystery to me right now.  

Most of my knowledge so far has come from self-research, online rabbit holes, and communities like this one. I’m very open to learning, adjusting, and even being corrected. If anyone has tips, feedback, or resources, I’d genuinely appreciate it!

Thanks in advance for reading and helping out!

For reference, I am a nursing student graduating next year-I also work part-time as a nursing assistant, my gf works as a mechanic full time. We both quite have a active and busy life- we workout together, I’m busy with school/work and she works like crazy, we go out atleast once a week, could be a quick coffee date or movie night and we usually split the cost between us two evenly(maybe she covers 60% as she makes more) So two weeks ago I thinking of opening up my TFSA account for investment . I have abit of money saved up to put into it. But i figured to ask her for extra money to put into in it as well-but she doesn’t believe in such investment despite me explaining its benefits long term and so she dishearteningly refused to lend me money. I have never asked her for money or anything financial related until now. Fast forward to today, I need to pay tuition for my summer courses and clinicals preceptorships(3k$)- and I don’t quite have that money yet, so I courageously asked my gf again if she can lend me money to pay for tuition-I felt reluctant to reach out to her as she previously declined to share her money. So she declined again despite me telling her I need it for school-like I mean sure, the investment one was okay(but still upset over that), but now this is important! This is for my education-my future!-her reason of refusal was to ask my parents and my parents are not really part of my life anymore and she knows better. And she mentioned that she’s saving her money “for future use and needs” and that she worked hard for it. I’m having lots of emotions right now, i just didn’t see this in her-she always has been kind to me and her family. I sort of feel abandoned, I feel stupid for almost begging her.

So it’s going to be my 28th birthday in a couple days. My  wisdom teeth are currently infected and for a few days I have been at home trying to take it easy until I get my teeth pulled. This is the first time in a long while where I have actually had a decent amount of time away from work, and I’ve noticed some thoughts or realizations coming to the surface. I’m a Starbucks barista and have been on for almost six years. For the past year Ive been working six days a week Monday through Saturday (I do this to qualify for more hours plus I like my job, more on this later). I became a barista right after graduating college in 2019 when my mom and I made a big move from Indianapolis Indiana to Los Angeles California. It was a job I wanted because we needed to save up money as quickly as possible, I liked the flexibility, the business of the job and I was eager to help my mom of course. Like I said that was almost six years ago and I’m still working as a barista even though Ive been well aware of the fact that this is not the career path for me and it never was. 

I guess because I’ve had this time off I’m realizing that I want to make “career moves”. Actually I think I’ve been feeling this way since the very end of 2024 and I think I’ve made some EXTREMELY minor “moves”. I would love to see significant change in my career somehow by the end of this year but not only do I have no idea what I want to do in a career sense, I sense that I’m too comfortable at my barista job to actually do anything about it. 

It’s weird. For example, most the time when I’m at work during a shift I get these intense emotions and voices in my head saying, “I’ve got to get out of here/this isn’t what I want to be doing with my life/I feel like I’m wasting my potential, I’ve been here too long” etc. Usually around this point I make a mental note that today I’m going to go home and do some “career stuff”. This usually means researching jobs or creating emails reaching out to people I admire for advice, updating my resume etc. Then time passes, I make drinks, I talk to my coworkers, I have lunch, I go back on bar, maybe the voices come back, maybe they don’t depending on how busy we are. Then, I go home and I remember how I felt earlier in the day. I remember the dissatisfaction and I’ve been feeling it for a minute now so I know it’s there, but then when I’m home and work is over it’s like I don’t care about my desire to make a change anymore. The dissatisfaction feels faint, and I usually spend the rest of my day not doing career stuff and then feeling a little guilty when I don’t. But still I’m reluctant to budge. 

I think there are pieces of me that secretly don’t believe in my ability to make any real change so I don’t even try, and then there are other parts of me that believe that if I truly wanted it, I would be more determined to make it happen and I feel so strange that I’m not more aggressive. I want a new job and I’d love to bring more money in the house and just do something I really care about, or something I’m actually interested in from a mental standpoint, so why is it so hard to move towards the thing I want? Even on the days when I do sit down for a couple of hours and do “career stuff”, I feel so extremely dissatisfied and like I’m not doing it “right”, whatever that means. I know it’s not supposed to be fun like a roller coaster but sometimes it doesn’t feel like I’m doing anything at all even when I technically am. I struggle to do it consistently and when I do do it I just feel either weird, dissatisfied, frustrated or like I’m failing at something. My mom’s always telling me I need to just push through, but how? And why? And how do you know when you’ve pushed through enough or correctly? 


Even now on my little vacation there are huge chunks of me that can’t imagine going back to work but at the same time I know it’s not a bad a job, I make a decent chunk of change every week, I get benefits, free coffee, customers, and my coworkers adore me and I feel more then capable. But it’s funny because whenever my manger asks me if I want to move up and be a shift lead, I shudder and always turn it down because I think, I don’t want to get more stuck or comfortable than I already am. I fear growing even more enmeshed with the place. But if that’s the fear why stay so still? If I really wanted to make a change I would be trying harder right? A couple years ago I was trying to get my masters while working, this was during covid and everything eventually blew up in my face. I had to leave school because of a mental breakdown and it just wasn’t the right decision from the beginning. I realized that up to that point my motivations in life centered on making decisions from a place of deep self hatred and a desire to be seen as “good”. That was literally it. I don’t do this anymore thank god but I think that there is a part of me that fears becoming that person again, so maybe that’s another reason why I don’t push myself, I’m afraid of old patterns coming back? It seems like something in my head is just not clicking. 

Another thought that’s been surfacing is that I use work in order to feel good about myself, even though it’s not what I want to do and I don’t value it, I think I not only work so much (I’m always staying overtime if they need me, or cover other people shifts if there is a call off for example) but I keep working this job because I receive a lot of self worth/positive feedback from it. I don’t like the job but I like how the job stokes my ego in a sense. And I noticed in the past all I really needed was my check at the end of the week, to feel the intense morning rush and to receive a few compliments at my job and I was pretty content. But now I go into work, and I kinda don’t feel anything. No more satisfaction during the rush and the praise feels like nothing. As someone who spent years really struggling with people pleasing and desperately craving external validation (from childhood) I realized that this is a big no no and I want to “fix” this too but I don’t know where to start. Can anyone else relate? Thank you so much for your time. ",1,1748500782.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

I don’t know what to do.

Dotty doesn’t read here much; she’s very respectful of my sanctuary.  And while I don’t know her algorithm, it seems she’s only recently tapped the more general posts – the ones without secrets.  But here’s the thing… she’s my wife – there are no secrets.  I’ve explained to her a thousand times that she is entitled to know all of me.  As such, she is invited to read all of me.  I sort of wish she had read more of me right now, because if she had, she would know that you don’t mess with my study. 

As I say this, there remains a hypocritical caveat.  In the past, you may have noticed the word “asterisk” at the start of a post.  That’s a signal that I don’t want her to read it, lol.  I haven’t done that much, maybe twice.  Now three.

After we were home from our trip, Dot was determined that I needed to have some time with Dan.  It was all arranged.  He was in on it, though blindly.  It was a play-date and I knew something was up, but I went along.  Dan and I did the 18 holes of golf and settled with a drink after – we had a nice time.

I had no idea what would happen next. 

All of my friends here know that my study is my asylum; my haven.  It is my place in the world.  It is where I work it is where I think; it is where I’ve lived in the best and the worst of times.  It is from my study that I first told you that I was suddenly alone, and it is from this room that I share my story.  It is where my mind and memory live, it is mine alone.  It is lived-in, it is aged – it is chaos, it is order.  It is me.

She has a good heart, does Dot, but I don’t have to tell you that.  You already know.

I came home to new and improved study.  She redecorated it for me.  And suddenly, I’m in hell.

I can only imagine the work she put into this, the planning.  She pulled it off in less than five hours.  It’s absolutely beautiful.  Gone is my frumpy couch and the glorious leather wingchair that once sat beside it, the coffee table made of a wooden ship’s door, the worn out red Persian rug.  She took out the sofa table with my toy trucks and the pictures of my boys.  It’s been replaced by a handsome set, cheery in blues and yellows and a trendy rug, faux in its distress, laid askew beneath them.  It could be a magazine.  There are black and glass tables now with complementing lamps in dark bronze and a pedestal with a wild floral arrangement that seems to tie it all together.  

I couldn’t hide it.  I tried.  She knows I’m not happy.

As a reasonable man, I know that so much of this is on me – it’s a lot about my stodginess and clinging to the tradition of this room.  Dotty is held harmless – I know she meant well and I love her for the work and the intention.  But it’s not me. 

Even on 82^(nd) street, I had my own little space.  Then, it was a 6x3 corner between the kitchenette and the only bathroom, but it was mine.  And it’s where I wrote.  When we lived on Federal, my world expanded to the unheard of “spare” bedroom.  I was in high-cotton then. 

Suzie lured me to this farm with the promise that this room, this stately study, would be my own private universe.  And that’s how it’s been.

She tried, did Suzie, to change this space – she always wanted to “doll it up.”  Yet each time the subject arose, I wouldn’t hear of it.  She never once fought back.  

My chair, my leather wingchair – I bought it at an auction after I sold my first project – it’s old and it’s beautiful.  I fed Zach his first bottle in that chair and it’s the same chair that PJ held on to when he bounced his first steps.

But I think she knows that I’m not and I will have to tell her when we speak of it tomorrow.  I didn’t want to say it tonight; she was so excited.  I will have to tell her that I want it back the way it was.  And I know that when I do, it will be okay because she’ll really hear me and she’ll understand.  I’ll make sure.

I sit here now, looking out at this strange new room, and I wonder if there isn’t a compromise.  Maybe when we talk it through, I’ll ask to keep some of the changes.  And maybe it’s about time.",2,1748500547.0,FathersJourney,1,1.0,False
1ky3voz,https://www.reddit.com/r/italianamerican/comments/1ky3voz/thoughts_from_an_italian_teacher/,Thoughts from an Italian teacher,"I've been hanging around here for a while now, because I liked reading about the experiences of Italian-Americans, since most of my students are Italian-Americans.

But, then I realise that what I read here is the complete opposite of what I experience when I connect over Zoom with my students.

Here, I see a lot of anger, bitterness, and a strange competition going on, over ""who's more Italian"" or I get the feeling that some people think we, Italians in Italy, are not ""italianing"" in the correct way (how I love the English language, you can add -ing to any word and turn it into a verb!)

But then, when I connect with my students, I see a completely different kind of Italian-Americans. People eager to learn, happy, cheerful, open minded, proud of what they are in a way that draws you to them and makes you really feel connected. My students progress in the language, come here on holidays and are simply happy people.

I don't know what it is, it's not Reddit itself, as many of them come from here (maybe some are even in this subreddit, I don't know!)

The Italian-Americans I know ""in real life"" (if you can call Zoom videoconferencing the real life) have even been here to meet their long lost relatives after taking lessons with me, and I love seeing the happiness in their eyes when they share their experiences with me.

I love hearing about their life in America and they love hearing about my life in Italy, and also they have no problem talking about super American things as their own, I see that they have embraced life as it is around them just like we do in Italy.

I have never seen among my students these weird attacks saying that Italy has forgotten you, abandoned you, or this weird attachment to the past.

I've come to the conclusion that just because some people are very vocal about what they feel, it doesn't mean that they speak for the entire group, even though for a bit I had started to believe it.

My real experience with Italian-Americans is that they are just like us Italian-Italians: normal.

I'd like to hear your thoughts about it, and maybe invite even some of you to a Zoom aperitivo or coffee for a happy chat?

Hey everyone,

I need to get something off my chest that I genuinely believe is a universal truth, and I'm ready for the debate (but also not really, because I'm right).

**A good hoodie makes EVERYTHING better.**

Seriously, think about it.

* **Feeling cozy at home?** Hoodie.
* **Running errands but still want to feel put-together (ish)?** Hoodie.
* **Sudden chill in the air?** Hoodie.
* **Need to hide from the world a little bit?** Hoodie.
* **Going for a casual coffee with friends?** Hoodie.
* **Long flight or road trip?** HOODIE.
* **Just want to feel like you're wrapped in a warm hug?** Hoodie.

It's the ultimate comfort staple for literally anyone, any mood, any place. Age, gender, style preference – none of it matters. A well-fitting, soft, and comfortable hoodie is a game changer. It's the democratic garment of pure bliss.

""Catherine, sit down. We need to talk,"" my father said, looking quite agitated.

""What's going on, Dad?"" I asked tiredly. I had worked all day, gone to college at night, and upon getting home, all I wanted was to take a shower and crash into bed. But that wasn't possible.

""Catherine, your cousin's wedding invitation has arrived,"" my mother said.

""That little tramp is not my cousin!"" I snapped, already getting angry.

""Catherine, she is your cousin,"" my mother insisted. ""You need to stop this childish behavior. Melissa already hit her and caused a scene here at home. Enough! She's my sister's daughter, which makes her your cousin.""

""I'm sorry, Mom, but she means nothing to me,"" I tried to stay calm. ""She slept with my boyfriend in my bed. That's not something she should do.""

I had been dating Claude for four years; he was my first boyfriend, and I found him in my bed, in my room, sleeping with Kelly, my cousin! I was in shock. Of course, Melissa, my best friend, went after them. Since then, things had been tensed at home because my parents insisted it was silly and that I should act as if nothing had happened and go back to being around my cousin.

""He was wrong, Catherine, since he was your boyfriend,"" my mother argued. ""Kelly, poor thing, was seduced. He dishonored her, now he's marrying her so she won't be talked about badly in town.""

""Oh, Mom! Spare me! The whole town knows Kelly is a shameless woman..."" I lost my patience.

""Catherine, watch your language!"" my father scolded me. ""Look, if you don't want to be around Kelly, fine, but you're going to this wedding. And enough with this rude behavior.""

""I'm what?"" I thought I had heard wrong.

""You're going to your cousin's wedding, Catherine. That's an order! We're your parents, and you'll obey,"" my mother spoke angrily at me as if I were the one in the wrong.

""I'm sorry, Mom, but I won't! I follow your rules, I'm a good daughter, but this time I can't. I was the one who was wronged! I have every right not to want to be the family joke anymore,"" I said, already crying.

""ENOUGH, CATHERINE!"" my father shouted, startling me. ""You're going to this wedding, and that's final.""

""But, Dad...""

""I don't want to hear it, Catherine! It's important to your mother to keep peace in the family. So you're going, period,"" my father said, leaving no room for argument.

I spent the night crying in my room. The next day, I told Melissa everything. She wasted no time and arranged invitations to a masquerade ball, a gala event. She told my parents it would be crucial for my career since the city's most important businesspeople would be there. I could make valuable connections, and our professors had promised to introduce us to various entrepreneurs who could open doors for our professional future.

At first, my parents weren't entirely convinced, but Melissa's parents talked to them and persuaded them that it would be an excellent opportunity for my future. So they agreed that I should take advantage of it.

""Catherine, you can't say no to me! I've already bought the tickets and masks, and I even convinced your parents that this is a super important event for your professional future, which was such hard work. This party is going to be incredible, and you're not going to miss it!"" Melissa looked at me with puppy dog eyes, clasping her hands together as if begging.

I was sitting at my desk at work in the middle of a Thursday afternoon, between taking messages and making calls, when Mel showed up with coffee, chocolate muffins, and this persistence about getting me to agree to go to the masquerade ball, which was the biggest annual event in our city.

""Oh, Mel, how is it that I can never say no to you? Alright, I'll go!""

I agreed to go to the ball, but I still wasn't sure. Either way, I was going to sleep at Mel's house to avoid the wedding, but I wasn't planning on going to the party. However, Melissa kept pushing until she convinced me to go. On Saturday, we got ready at her place.

""Wow, girl! You look absolutely stunning!"" She handed me a beautiful golden mask, intricately designed like lace that covered up to my nose, and I put it on. I was wearing a shimmering red satin dress, and the mask matched perfectly. ""So, are we ready?""

""Yes, we're ready,"" I replied and grabbed my purse. ""Oh, I forgot my perfume.""

""No problem, you can use my mom's new perfume. She won't mind.""

When Fred, Mel's boyfriend, saw us, he smiled, gave Mel a kiss, and said:

""Girls, you look gorgeous! I think you'll leave this party with a new boyfriend, Cat.""

""No boyfriend, Fred. Actually, I think I'd better stay, I'm not in the party mood. Please, Mel, let me stay?""

Chapter 2

There was no way out - my friend dragged me to the ball. As soon as we got in, Mel pulled us to the bar and whispered in my ear:

""It's an open bar tonight, so you're going to drink until all that sadness washes away!"" Mel handed me two tequila shots while holding two more in her hands. ""Let's down these!"" We knocked back the tequila, and Fred was already handing each of us a cosmopolitan.

Melissa dragged me to the dance floor, and I was actually having fun. When a slow song started playing, Fred and Mel began slow dancing together. I took that as my cue to head to the buffet, but I didn't make it there. I felt someone grab my hand, and when I turned around, there was a man in a black mask smiling at me - and what a smile! He kissed my hand and pulled me close, whispering in my ear with a husky voice:

""Surely the most beautiful woman in the room won't deny me a dance, will she?""

""And why not? Let's dance,"" I smiled back at him.

It was impossible to resist that seductive husky voice and that gorgeous crooked smile! He was tall with broad shoulders, had a charming smile and blue eyes - so blue they were almost violet. He had sinfully tempting lips, brown hair, and when he pulled me by the waist, I placed my hands on his chest and could feel he was a wall of well-defined muscle. Although the mask concealed his face, he was very charming and enchanting.

""I've been watching you since you arrived,"" this mysterious man whispered in my ear. ""You're so beautiful!""

""You're kind. But you're not from around here, are you?"" He had a powerful presence, radiating authority.

""No. A friend convinced me to come to this party.""

""Looks like we have something in common - my friends convinced me to come too.""

""Lucky me!""

""And why's that?"" I smiled.

""Because I was captivated the moment I saw you. You're stunning."" As he whispered in my ear, I got goosebumps, feeling my face flush and my body tingle - he truly had me enchanted.

""Even with the mask?""

""Even with the mask! You're too beautiful.""

""You're such a charmer.""

""You think I'm charming?""

""You know you are. And handsome too.""

""I'm glad you like what you see.""

""And what do you do for a living, handsome?"" - I felt a bit dizzy, not sure if it was from the drink or the delicious cologne that man was wearing. I ended up stumbling over my own feet.

""Are you okay?""

""I think I need some air.""

""Come with me."" - He pulled me into a dark hallway that led to an emergency exit and started fanning my face. - ""I really want to kiss you. May I?"" - I nodded yes.

He looked into my eyes, held the back of my neck, and our lips met. It started slow but deepened; he pressed me against the wall, and the kiss intensified even more, almost taking our breath away. When he broke the kiss so we could breathe, we looked into each other's eyes - it was like throwing gasoline on fire. He ran his hand down my waist to my leg and pulled my leg up to his waist. I was completely surrendered by then, feeling his body against mine. I went crazy with desire and pulled him closer, wrapping my leg around his waist.

""You're a great kisser!"" - I smiled at him and felt my whole body tingle.

""Oh, beautiful, you're incredible. I want you so badly, here, right now!"" - he said between kisses and slipped his hand under my dress, pulling it up and reaching my underwear. I was on fire when he put his hand inside my underwear and yelled. - ""Oh! So delicious! So hot, so wet!"" - He said and kissed me harder while unzipping his pants. With a quick movement, like someone who had done this before, he tore my underwear and caressed my entrance, as if asking for permission. He looked into my eyes again and asked: ""What do you want me to do?""

""I want you inside me now!"" I responded shamelessly, already panting with desire. I couldn't resist those eyes and that husky voice. I'd never been like this before - normally, I would have pulled away the moment he grabbed my hand, but tonight I had promised myself to have fun and live in the moment if someone interesting came along. And that's exactly what I was doing, living in the moment.

Hearing me, he entered me slowly, watching as I leaned my head against the wall and savored every inch of him - and he was huge. He took the opportunity to scatter kisses along my neck. When he was fully inside, he paused and whispered between kisses in my ear: ""Now I'm going to move."" He pulled out only to thrust back in with full force this time, and it was incredible. I was completely lost and driven wild by his movements as he moved in and out of me frantically.

We lost control and gave ourselves over completely, as if nothing else existed around us. I felt a haze in my eyes as my climax began to build, and I moaned softly in his ear. At that moment, he seemed to go crazy, lifting my other leg to his waist as I wrapped them around him. Kissing me intensely, he thrust even harder into me - it was heaven on earth. I came again, even more intensely than before, leaving me breathless. As I was coming, he whispered that he was close to his limit feeling me pulse around him, and soon I felt his hot release inside me.

We stayed there against that wall, completely breathless, his forehead resting against mine. While kissing me, he slowly withdrew, and I was thoroughly satisfied - as Melissa would say. I smiled and he looked at me, gave me a soft kiss and said:

""You're truly amazing!""

He gently lowered my legs until my feet touched the ground, fixed my dress, adjusted his pants, and hugged me. It was so intimate, so affectionate - despite the wildness of our encounter and the intensity with which we'd given in to each other, he was still gentle with me. I'd never had such an incredible experience, but I'd only ever been with my ex until now. And my ex had never cared about hugging me afterward, or worried about my pleasure - for him, it was just about getting in and out until he was satisfied. So having a man care about me, about my pleasure, take care of me - it was new, and amazingly so. He kissed my neck and whispered in my ear:

""So, beautiful, I still don't know your name."" It took me seconds to process and finally realize that I'd just slept with a complete stranger whose name I didn't even know.

Just as I was about to speak, he pulled his phone from his pocket and asked for a minute to answer it. He stepped away slightly and I could only hear him raising his voice saying:

""What did you say?"" At that moment, the stranger ran off as if he'd forgotten about me, or as if he was just running away from the woman he'd quickly hooked up with at the party.

Of course, Catherine, you're an idiot! But so what? I was just having fun too, and I didn't even know who the guy was, and he didn't know who I was. All good. I pulled myself together, looked in vain for my underwear - no idea where he'd thrown it - and left that hallway.

I went back to the table and found Mel and Fred making out. They soon stopped and focused on me:

""Mel, I think I found the Big Bad Wolf!"" I laughed, and she laughed with me.

""When we get home, I want to know everything!""

""Of course you do!"" I replied with sparkling eyes.

""Prince, I think we can go now. What do you think, Cat?""

""I'm ready whenever you are!"" I said, downing a glass of water.

""Let's go then, girls!"" Fred said and led us to the exit.

We'd barely gotten home when Mel started demanding:

""Tell me everything - who is he, how it went, how it didn't go, everything.""

I laughed and told her everything. When I finished speaking, my friend was staring at me open-mouthed and asked:

""You guys used protection, right?""

My heart started racing! We hadn't used protection. I shook my head no at her; I was in shock realizing how careless I'd been. She immediately tried to calm me down:

""No, Cat, calm down. I'm sure nothing will come of it. But you should get some tests done to make sure everything's okay. I'm going to the kitchen to make us some tea. Don't freak out!""

Chapter 3

On Monday during lunch, I met Mel. She handed me a small bag from a fancy store, and I looked at her, confused.

""My mom asked me to give this to you. She said it's perfect for you and doesn't suit her,"" Mel said with a big smile.

I opened the bag, and inside was the perfume I had worn to the ball. A huge smile spread across my face. I loved that perfume, and it was part of the best night of my life. I just hoped that my best night hadn't left me with an STD as a souvenir. With that thought, I thanked Mel and told her I'd call her mom later, then mentioned I wanted to call the lab to schedule some tests.

I called the laboratory and was informed that I needed a doctor's prescription to get the tests covered by health insurance. Thank God the company provided health insurance for employees because otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do. My salary wasn't high, and what little was left after covering college expenses went to helping at home, since my mom didn't work outside the house and my dad didn't make much as a driver.

So I made a doctor's appointment, but the earliest available slot was two weeks away, and I waited anxiously. The more days passed, the more nervous I became, though Mel did everything to calm me down. On the scheduled date, she went to the doctor's with me. With the list of tests in hand, she personally scheduled the lab work and insisted on accompanying me. Three weeks had passed since the party when I finally got the tests done. The results came back five days later, and I returned to the doctor. Of course, Mel was with me.

The doctor checked the results and looked me in the eyes:

""Miss Catherine, your health is excellent. You're healthy. But from now on, you'll need to take better care of yourself.""

I breathed a sigh of relief, but was I really about to get lectured by the doctor for having unprotected bedlife with a stranger? Well, I deserved it - not using protection was silly, I could have caught a disease. And then he continued:

""Congratulations, you're conceived! I'm going to refer you to an OB-GYN for prenatal care...""

I didn't hear anything else, just the blood pulsing in my ears. I couldn't believe this! conceived? How would I explain this? It's not possible. Me, of all people, the perfect goody-two-shoes who never stepped out of line, who always considered the consequences before doing anything, who was always responsible - the first time I let rationality slide, I ended up conceived and didn't even know who the father was! Mel held my hand and kept repeating:

""Calm down, Cat, everything will be okay!""

How could everything be okay? I didn't even know who the father was. I would have to tell my parents, their only daughter would break their hearts. They would be disappointed, hate me, and kick me out of the house. How could I explain that I don't even know what the father of my child looks like? I was already hyperventilating. Suddenly, I felt the doctor taking my hand and speaking calmly:

""Easy now, dear! The situation, from what I can see, isn't ideal, but you can't get this nervous, it will harm your baby. Now you have to take care of yourself for the baby's sake. I'm sure the people who love you will support and help you. But you need to calm down because only you can ensure this baby develops healthily and is born strong. Do you understand me?""

I looked at that short, white-haired, slightly chubby gentleman, with his glasses perched on the tip of his nose, and nodded positively. Somehow he calmed me down a bit, maybe because his eyes sparkled with a kindness and understanding that we rarely see these days. The doctor asked his secretary to bring me some chamomile tea, and while I drank it and tried to calm down, he gave all the information to Melissa, who listened attentively.

We left the office and Melissa took me to a diner, saying we needed to eat something. As soon as I sat down, I felt the tears falling. My friend hugged me and told me once again that I wasn't alone. I looked at her and said:

""The only thing I'm sure of right now is that I want you and Fred to be my child's godparents because I know you'll support them and give them lots of love.""

Her eyes sparkled, and she burst into tears, responding between sobs:

""I'll be the best godmother in the world and I'll always be close to our baby! And I'm sure Fred will be very happy too!""

She assured me she would always be by my side, made it clear that I wouldn't go through anything alone, and that she would be with me when I talked to my parents. My parents... oh! I started thinking and decided I wouldn't hide it from them for even a day; I would tell them that very night. I wouldn't go to college, I would go home to talk to them. Mel immediately supported me and said:

""Let's go then, I'm with you!""

When we arrived at my house, my parents were startled, and my mom came right over, worried:

""Girls, didn't you go to class today? Is everything okay?""

""Not really, Mom. I need to talk to you both.""

My parents immediately realized it was something very serious. We all sat in the living room and I told them what was happening, admitting I had been irresponsible by hooking up with a stranger at the party. I obviously didn't go into details, but I made it clear that I couldn't find my child's father again. The disappointment in their eyes was evident. My mother was sobbing uncontrollably, saying I was ruined. My father hadn't said anything yet. Seeing how upset my mother was, Melissa quickly went to the kitchen and came back with a glass of sugar water for her. Melissa always gives sugar water to nervous people, saying it calms them down - I never understood that.

Finally, my father spoke:

""You made a huge mistake and there's no going back.""

My parents were very simple people. My father was a tall, strong man, and my mother was an older version of me, but both had great character and solid principles they always made sure to pass on to me. Hearing my father emphasize that I had messed up made my heart ache even more. I started crying and said:

""I know, Dad, I was irresponsible. But there's nothing I can do now. I'll drop out of college to raise my child. And I'm going to pack my bags...""

""Pack your bags? You're very mistaken if you think you're leaving this house like that. You made a mistake, and you disappointed us, but we love you, we'll get through this and we'll help you. You're not alone, my daughter! And neither is this child!"" My father said this and my heart filled with hope.

""But Dad, I brought shame to you...""

""You're not the first and won't be the last single mother in this world. We would have liked things to be different for you, not so difficult. You've always been so responsible! But if this is how it is, we'll face it together. You won't leave college - more than ever, you need to grow in life to take care of your child. You're going to be a single mother, your responsibility is huge. We'll help you, and even though it will be difficult, everything will work out.""

Melissa was already crying and quickly spoke to my parents:

""Mr. Anthony, Mrs. Selina, you can count on me, I'll help with everything! Besides, I'm this baby's godmother, Cat is like a sister to me, and I'll always be around.""

My parents looked at her gratefully. I looked at those three feeling completely blessed to have them in my life, full of love for them and experiencing a totally new feeling for that little being still growing inside me, whose existence I had just discovered!

As difficult as being a single mother would be, that night at the ball was the best night of my life. I could never forget those violet-blue eyes looking at me with adoration during our furtive encounter and everything my body experienced that night. I would always have that sweet memory with me.

The following months were difficult. I kept the dress, shoes, mask, and perfume that Mel's mother gave me in a box. On difficult days, I would open that box and relive that night in my memory.

Although I had a peaceful pregnancy, people's comments and cruelty were hard to bear. To make matters worse, after they got married, my ex and my cousin moved in with her parents, who lived on the same street as us. They made sure to humiliate me with nasty comments whenever they saw me and spread throughout the neighborhood that I didn't know who my child's father was and that I was a loose woman, which was why Claude had left me. I wanted to end them! Kelly's mother, who was my mother's sister, never missed a chance to come to our house and torment us, saying how fortunate it was that her daughter wasn't like me, that she was a good girl who had married a decent man. She seemed to have forgotten that she had stolen my boyfriend and slept with him in my bed.

But I swallowed it all; it wasn't worth arguing with these people, and I didn't want to transmit negative feelings to my child. As the days went by, I loved that baby more and more. I had no idea such love could exist. Everything I did, I did for him. I would protect him from everything; I would give my life to him. And surprisingly, during the whole time of carrying with a baby, everything seemed to flow in my favor, things were falling into place and working out.

My boss was great, understood my situation, and even gave me a small raise, which was a huge help! Mel and Fred showered me with attention, they were in love with their godchild even before knowing if it would be a girl or boy. They insisted on buying everything for the nursery, which turned out beautiful. Mel accompanied me to all appointments and every test, never missing anything. She even organized two baby showers - one at the company and another at college. My child would come into the world surrounded by love.

I found out I was having a boy and decided to name him Peter. And so it was. Peter was born healthy, with a pair of huge violet-blue eyes that would never let me forget the night that changed my life, but was also the best night I'd ever had! I would never forget that man!

My son was surrounded by love from the first moment. My parents were enchanted by their grandson. Mel and Fred came to our house every day to see their godson and check how we were doing. Mel was always there supporting me in everything. Her parents also came to visit Peter and said they would be honorary grandparents since they considered me their daughter too, which I found beautiful. They also surrounded me with care. They insisted on giving the stroller as a gift, and the day Peter was born, they came to the maternity ward with a huge basket of flowers and welcome balloons.

After my maternity leave ended, my son stayed in my mother's care while I was at work and college. I worked hard and devoted all my time not spent at college or work to my son. With the help of my parents and my son's godparents, I managed everything and didn't miss any semester in college, graduating alongside my friend Melissa. It was a great moment for me and my family. With my diploma in hand, I would now pursue a better future, with the firm purpose that my son would never lack anything.

Chapter 4

When I graduated, Peter was already two years old. By then, he was walking everywhere, always clinging to grandma - which was his first word. He was a beautiful boy with straight black hair, fair skin, a cute little upturned nose, and those huge violet eyes that made me sigh. He was my sunshine! And now I would have more time for him.

After graduation, my boss called me in for a chat. He was an excellent boss and said he was very happy with my work at the company, but he knew I deserved to go far, so I should look for a job in my field, and he would understand. He assured me that my job at the construction company would be mine for as long as I wanted, and if I left and things didn't work out, I would always have a place to come back to. However, he advised that I should seek something in my field of study to provide a better future for my son. I was very touched by this and accepted his good advice.

I told Melissa, and she immediately said she would talk to her father about reaching out to some contacts. It didn't take long before Mr. Oliver Larson, Mel's father, called me to his office and handed me a card, saying:

""Catherine, I know you're an excellent girl and a good professional. I spoke with a friend, and he arranged an interview for you at Miller Group. It's for the position of CEO's assistant. If you get this job, you'll be working in your field at a global company. It's an excellent position, but it's not here in Bellwood. You would have to move to Paradise Port. I know it's a huge step, but I think you should consider it - it will be excellent for you. Anyway, send an email to the address on the card with your response, either declining the position or accepting the virtual interview.""

""Mr. Larson, I don't have words to thank you! You've always been so good to me! Miller Group is one of the largest business conglomerates in the country! Working there is a dream! I'll definitely accept the interview, and if I have to move, I will. I know it will be a great opportunity,"" I said with conviction. It wouldn't be bad to get away from those nasty family members, especially now that ""queen"" Kelly was conceived and her mother decided to ask for all of Peter's things for the child of that dishonest couple! Thankfully, my mom told her that was absurd, but it wouldn't matter anyway since I had already given everything Peter had outgrown to an acquaintance who was conceived. My mom had been very upset with her sister, as she was always dismissing my son, always referring to him as the fatherless boy, which really hurt my mom. Leaving this city, I'll only regret leaving my parents and friends behind, but I know they'll support me once again.

I thanked Mr. Larson and left the office. When I got to my desk, I spoke with my boss, another Mr. Larson, but since he didn't like being called that, I addressed him by his first name:

""Aldo, your brother got me an interview at Miller Group.""

He smiled:

""I know, he just called me. I think you should grab this opportunity. If it doesn't work out, you can always come back.""

I smiled at him and immediately sent an email to schedule the interview. I quickly received confirmation that the interview would be the next day at ten in the morning, and since I had already taken the initiative to send my resume, the interview would be brief.

That night at home, I talked to my parents, who understood, even though they were worried about how I would manage to raise a child alone in another city and got teary-eyed about being far from their grandson. They supported me as always and were happy about the opportunity I received. I asked them not to tell anyone. When Mel arrived - she came every day to see her godson - I told her everything, and she helped me prepare for the next day.

At the time of the interview, I went to the meeting room at my workplace; my boss had given me permission. I sat down and waited for the call. I was interviewed by a very kind and intelligent woman, Mrs. Mariana Taylor. It was very pleasant; we talked for two hours. She gave me all the information about the position, salary, and benefits. At the end, she said:

""Catherine, you're hired! You'll be replacing me since I'm taking a director position at the London branch, so you'll be taking over my position here. I'd like you to start as soon as possible because I'm leaving in ten days and would like to hand everything over to you before I go. And I'd rather not reschedule my departure. When can you start?""

""I just need my boss to release me, but I think I can be there on Monday."" - it was already Friday, would Aldo agree to release me today?

""Perfect. You can send me an email confirmation after you talk to him. Do you have any questions?""

""No, ma'am. Everything is clear.""

""Great! Welcome to Miller Group. I'm sure you'll do very well. I'll see you on Monday.""

She ended the call, and my heart was racing - I had done it. The job was great, the salary even better, and I would have chances to progress. It was a dream. But now it was time to rush and sort everything out.

I immediately went to talk to my boss. He was happy about it, called accounting, and had them process my settlement right away. After that, he let me go, saying I would always have a place to come back if needed, but he knew I would do very well. I thanked him for everything and left. I sent the confirmation email to Mrs. Taylor, saying I would be at the company at eight on Monday morning, and went straight to talk to Mel and her father - I had to thank them. And that's when Mel surprised me:

""Did you think you were going to take my godson away just like that? No way! My father got me an interview at Lynx World in Paradise Port. I'm moving with you, and we'll live together. What do you think?""

This was perfect! I was overjoyed, but quickly asked:

""Mel, what about Fred?""

""Fred has already requested a transfer to the Paradise Port branch at his company; he'll have better opportunities there too. He's coming in fifteen days. Friend, it's a new life for all three of us.""

I was so happy. Mel had orchestrated everything. Fred would drive us there, and she would take care of Peter while I worked until we found a daycare. She already had three daycares to visit, and her father had already made available a furnished apartment in the city for us. It was too good to be true; I was even scared. Noticing this, Mel nudged me and said:

""Learn to accept the good things life offers you!""

I smiled at her, and we went to my parents' house. It was time to break the news and say goodbye. Paradise Port is on the other side of the country, so we wouldn't see each other for a while. My parents were happy until I said I would leave the next morning - then the farewell became sad. It was hard to leave them behind, but it was necessary. With the salary I would receive, I could help them now. That was good.

The next morning, Fred and Mel arrived right on time. Mel's father had given her a pickup truck as a gift, which made moving our stuff much easier. Fred loaded everything into the truck, and off we went - it would be a full day on the road.

We arrived in Paradise Port late Saturday night. Peter was exhausted but had enjoyed himself immensely during the trip - everything was new and exciting to him. We got settled in, ordered some food, and after eating, went to bed. On Sunday, we explored the city to get our bearings. Paradise Port was a huge, modern industrial city on the coast. Its port attracted lots of business, making it a first-world urban center.

The apartment where we would be living was close to one of the daycares Mel had contacted, which was great. It wasn't far from the company either - I could get there in twenty minutes by subway. The apartment was beautiful, with a modern design, great ventilation, and huge windows that let in plenty of natural light. That evening, we dropped Fred off at the airport and headed home to rest. The next day would be a big one - I would be starting my new job, while Mel had her virtual interview and would schedule a meeting with the director of the daycare near our apartment to visit and talk.

I tucked my son into bed; he was worn out from all the fun he'd had today. As I watched him sleeping peacefully, I felt confident that we would have a really good life here. Peter now had his own room, and Mel and I had planned to buy some things to make it feel more personal and give it our own touch. I grabbed the baby monitor and went to my room. I opened one of my boxes and started organizing everything. When I opened the last box, I took out the box containing my memories from the ball night. I opened it, ran my hand over that beautiful dress, and sighed once again. I picked up the perfume and thought, ""Why not?"" Starting tomorrow, I would wear this perfume every day - my salary was good, and when this bottle ran out, I could buy another. I put the box away, left the perfume on the dresser, and went to bed full of expectations for this new life that was opening up before me.

Chapter 5

I showed up at the company at 8:00 a.m. Mrs. Taylor gave me a warm welcome and introduced me to everyone, and they were all very kind. The boss wasn't there - he was traveling and would return at the end of the week. The office was beautiful, very modern, decorated in white with stainless steel and green accents, managing to be both professional and welcoming. It was elegant, and I really liked it. I was particularly glad I had chosen to wear a black suit with a dark green silk blouse underneath and black heels. I would need to dress elegantly every day now, after all, I would be working directly with the company president.

Mid-morning, I received a message from Mel saying she had managed to schedule an appointment with the director of the daycare near our apartment during lunch hour. I explained the situation to Mrs. Taylor and asked if it would be possible to leave during that time, assuring her I would be back on schedule.

""So you have a child. How old is he?"" she asked with a smile.

""He's two years old. He's a very clever little boy. He wasn't planned, but he's the reason for my life!""

""What's his name?""

""Peter.""

""Peter. A strong name. You're not married, I know that, but what about your son's father, are you still together?"" My heart sank - how could I explain to her that I didn't know who the father was? But I don't lie, so let's face the truth. I told her that Peter's father was someone I met at a party and never saw again. She looked at me seriously, but there was no judgment in her eyes. Then she said:

""You have my respect, Catherine. It's not easy being a single mother, and it's very difficult to tell truths like this when you know they might trigger others' judgment. Thank you for your trust and honesty. Go take care of the daycare arrangements for your son, we'll continue this afternoon - no need to rush.""

I thanked her and said goodbye, heading off to meet Mel and Peter. My admiration and respect for Mrs. Taylor only grew. She's a woman in her mid-fifties, with very light blonde hair and almost transparent blue eyes. She's a beautiful and elegant woman, but most importantly, she's very welcoming. We got along very well. During the rest of the morning, she filled me in with information about the work, and I took notes on everything. At lunchtime, I left the building, and Mel was already waiting at the door with Peter. I got in the car, and we went to lunch before heading to the daycare.

Mel and I loved the daycare, and Peter was already fitting in, running around with his new little friends - he's such an outgoing boy. That made me so happy! My son was happy! We decided not to look at other daycares since this one was excellent and very close to home, just three blocks away. We completed the enrollment and sorted out all the details. The director suggested we let Peter stay until the end of the day since he was having fun and could start adapting. Mel agreed to pick him up at the end of the day.

Mel dropped me back at the company and told me she'd head home to prepare for her job interview later in the afternoon. I returned to my office, arriving before Mrs. Taylor. I sat at the desk and started reviewing everything she had already told me. The phone on the desk rang, and I wasn't sure what to do, but since this would be my desk, I answered in my most professional voice:

""Miller Group, Executive Office, good afternoon, how may I help you?""

I heard a deathly silence on the other end followed by a long sigh. Someone spoke up with obvious impatience, in a strong and slightly hoarse voice:

""Put Mariana on.""

I was startled but kept my composure and replied:

""I'm sorry, sir, but Mrs. Taylor hasn't returned from lunch yet. May I help you, or would you like to leave a message?""

""Who is this speaking,"" he asked, even more impatiently.

""My name is Catherine, I'm Mr. Miller's new executive assistant.""

""But I don't know you,"" he seemed to grow more impatient with each word.

""It's my first day here, sir. Would you like to leave a message?""

""Tell Mariana to call me as soon as she sets foot in the office.""

""Certainly, sir. And your name is?""

""Looks like I'm your boss!"" He snapped and hung up.

Wow, what a stressed-out man! This wasn't in the job description. My throat immediately tightened. Had I already made a bad impression on my boss? I was so screwed! I started thinking I wouldn't last long in this job. Shortly after, Mrs. Taylor arrived and I passed on the message with a worried look on my face. She looked at me with a smile, as if understanding my concern, and asked:

""Was he calm?""

I looked at her and couldn't help myself:

""He was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I'm pretty sure I could see his jugular vein popping out of his neck.""

She burst out laughing and then said:

""You two are going to get along great! You'll tame the beast, I'm sure of it.""

I wasn't so sure about that. Maybe I shouldn't even unpack my bags, this man was going to eat me alive!

If you’ve ever screamed internally while pretending to be normal, accidentally trauma-dumped on a new friend, or spent six hours hyperfixating on your D&D character’s tragic backstory… this post is for you.

A bit about me:
I’m turning 30 this year (cue dramatic music) and have been on a journey of self-discovery, healing, and figuring out how to build a life that feels actually good™. Been leveling up in therapy, investing stat points into self-love, and finally learned how to make a breakfast that isn’t just coffee and vibes.

But despite all that, I’ve realized something’s missing—people. My people. Fellow weirdos.
So here I am, casting Summon Internet Friends at 9th level.

Looking for:
	•	Fellow queer, neurodivergent, artistic goblins
	•	People who like to talk regularly, whether it’s deep convos, chaotic memes, or “look at this cursed item I just found in Baldur’s Gate”
	•	Creatives! I’m a writer—if you draw, paint, write, or cosplay, let’s trade inspo!
	•	Bonus points if you’re into D&D, TTRPGs, cozy/indie games, or just screaming about your OC’s trauma arc at 2am
	•	Furries welcome—if you have a sona, I already want to know everything about them
	•	Age range: ideally 25-35ish, but 21+ is the only hard rule. Any time zone is cool with me if it’s cool with you.

I’m not expecting overnight besties, but I am hoping to build real, long-term friendships. The kind where we accidentally stay up till 4am talking about life, drop hype in each other’s inboxes, and maybe even co-write chaotic worldbuilding lore for no reason other than fun.

If you made it this far, you’re probably at least a little weird. So what are you waiting for? Slide into my DMs like a bard with maxed-out Charisma and zero impulse control.

Let’s make magic together ✨
