Amy has basically been rotting in the house for years now and won‚Äôt even try to help herself. I do blame my mother for a lot of this as she never pushed my sister to get a job or do anything with her life. My mother is very mentally ill also and is very difficult to deal with and so is my Amy. They often trash the house and never help clean it, it‚Äôs always me who does it all because I can‚Äôt live the way they do. This past weekend I was fed up with always running after them but I know if I don‚Äôt the situation will only get worse so I asked Amy to help me clean the kitchen and all of a sudden she got mad and started crying and ran outside and hid in the shed for hours and wouldn‚Äôt come out. I tried asking if she was ok and even offered for her to watch tv in my room until she felt better. Honestly I was furious but I can‚Äôt say anything otherwise my mother would treat me like dog sh!t for the next couple of weeks which makes my life miserable so I didn‚Äôt bother. The thing is Amy is always happy to do things for herself such as go out and spend my mother‚Äôs money of stupid things such as $50 wedding dresses she cuts up and paints. She will do anything for herself and has no trouble getting what she wants down but absolutely refuses to help clean up her messes or do anything for anyone else. I don‚Äôt even bother talking to my mother about it because all I get is some narcissistic reply about it being all about her. I work a full time job and even manage to do everything when I‚Äôm very sick, last week I had tonsillitis and scrubbed the kitchen from top to bottom only to come out a couple hours later to find food, water, coffee and rubbish all over the kitchen again. If I don‚Äôt clean it, it becomes what looks like a hoarders house. I‚Äôve tried to help Amy get multiple jobs but she‚Äôs just not interested in anything thats not what she wants to do if that makes sense.

Existing Medical Issues: Insomnia, ASD, Anxiety

Current Medications: None

I'll try to keep this short: Recently had an ""experimental"" phase when I took a two-year break from college after deciding I hated my school and my major and needed time to think about what I was actually going to enjoy doing in my life. Lived with some friends during that time and partied quite a bit. Started smoking weed regularly and also doing some other drugs (mostly powder) but only sparingly. I also vaped.

4/20 rolls around and of course my friends want to party, so I partake. I thought that by that point my weed tolerance would be pretty high since I'd been smoking pretty consistently (I basically used it as a substitute for alcohol, which I liked less), and also figured it wouldn't matter since we originally had 5 or 6 people coming to share the blunt. Ofc, nobody actually shows up so my friend and I finish the whole thing off alone. I'm feeling alright, but about 20 minutes afterwards I start passing out, having trouble breathing, get horrific tremors, and lose all feeling on my right side. This lasts about 3-4 hours until I finally feel normal enough to pass out and get some rest. Idk if I just massively overestimated my tolerance or my friend just bought insanely strong/toxic shit (probably a little of both), but I have an awful time and decide to stop smoking (both weed and nicotine) for an indeterminate amount of time. I feel okay for exactly two weeks before I get a series of severe panic attacks (which I'd never had before) and awful migraines (which I had only occasionally before, but started to get every day). After another two weeks, both the panic attacks and migranes calm down, but now I'm left with a pretty weird assortment of symptoms that have lasted 5+ months with no real explanation, some of which are persistent and others that come and go.

In order of what bothers me the most:

1. Stiffness/weakness/slight loss of sensation on my right side. To be honest, I can't really tell if it's getting worse or staying the same. Sometimes I get a wave of tingling relief that washes over my body and I almost feel normal, but it usually only lasts a few minutes.
2. Twitching. It's calmed down a little bit, but I still twitch pretty consistently.
3. A hard-to explain feeling in my throat. It almost feels like... pressure? Or like something is blocking my throat? I'm really not sure how to describe it. It's this strange feeling at the front of my throat that almost sometimes feels... cold? It is sometimes difficult to swallow.
4. Random pressure on sides and back of head. Almost like tension headaches but they usually don't hurt, they're just annoying. I get these about 50/50 most nights.
5. Recurring breathlessness. I'll sometimes be sitting down and suddenly feel like I've been holding my breath for an hour. Usually goes away after 5-10 minutes, but is quite unpleasant.
6. Random pain in different parts of my body. Specifically my chest and armpit, neck, tongue, jaw, right eye, shoulders, and lower back. It's not often and usually goes away pretty quickly, but can be pretty sharp and hard to ignore.
7. Cracking/stiffness in my neck.
8. Anxiety and mood swings. These are possibly entirely unrelated issues.
9. Caffeine/Alcohol intolerance. I went from being able to tank 2-3 energy drinks to only being comfortable with a single cup of coffee before feeling way to jittery and restless.
10. Brain fog, forgetfulness, and trouble articulating or finding the right word. Comes and goes.

I've been pretty anxious about all this and have been in and out of doctor's offices trying to figure it out. My test results:  
Chest X-Ray: Clear

Brain CT Scan: Clear

Brain MRI: Minor Cerebellar Ectopia, otherwise clear

Blood Tests: Clear

EMG: Slight loss of conduction on my right side

I'm going to see a spine specialist and get a second opinion from a neurologist soon, but I'm getting tired of not knowing what this is or why it's not going away. Obviously I've been reading up on some of my symptoms and there's some pretty concerning stuff tied to what I'm experiencing. Does anyone think they can shed some light on what this is? Because nothing I read seems to really fit 1:1, and none of my tests have really confirmed anything.",1,1729576488.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I know they‚Äôre not the same thing, so this makes sense but I‚Äôm curious if anyone else notices big differences. The reason I ask is that I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs common for some people with ADHD to self medicate with coffee or energy drinks. Those have the opposite effect on me and actually make me fairly anxious and unable to do things or sometimes will give me a little energy or at least keep me awake but don‚Äôt make me want to be productive. I was taking vyvanse about a month ago and rarely got anxious on it and it helped me want to do productive things. This could have been a placebo with me starting new meds but I guess we‚Äôll see when I start to take it again. I‚Äôm trying to wait for the generic to come back in stock but if I start to get too chaotic I may just suck it up and pay for the brand. I wish I could use caffeine as a bandaid in the meantime but as I mentioned it doesn‚Äôt seem to help me. If I had to guess there‚Äôs likely some science behind the way the ADHD med is formulated that allows the meds to both give the energy and allows us to use that energy vs the caffeine giving the energy but then the energy doesn‚Äôt have anywhere to go.

Honestly that paragraph is mainly just context for why the question came up(you know we love our backstory lol). In short, I‚Äôm just curious if anyone else notices significant differences in how caffeine affects you vs ADHD stimulant meds and if caffeine helps you to be productive at all.

1g9b4u6,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychopath/comments/1g9b4u6/working_on_an_metalcore_album_dedicated_to/,"Working on an metal/core album dedicated to psychopathy, can you suggest some themes/ideas for songs?","First of all, here‚Äôs the tentative album cover, to kind of set the mood.

https://preview.redd.it/r3frqcslu8wd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fa3b6907d11bc4018d027c95d9e6dcb77d9d873

So the album‚Äôs to be called ‚ÄòPSCHPTHY‚Äô (by my AI metal band GENERATED) and will delve into topics related to Psychopathy. The music is mostly metal/core, with rap verses and electronic and symphonic infusions in some of the songs.

Below are snippets of lyrics to the tracks I have so far. To be clear, I am not, as far as I know, a psychopath myself, so I‚Äôm mostly talking about things I know little about ‚Äî which is why inputs from this community are so important to me.

‚Äú**Gray Rage**‚Äù ‚Äî focusing on the phenomenon of calculated, ‚Äúcold‚Äù anger (whether it is real or not, which I do not know):

>Step into my mind, a maze designed, cold and refined,

>Calculating every step, where passion slept, I never pined.

>You're caught in the storm, feelings worn, fury swarm,

>But I'm the eye, calm and sly, precision my norm.

>

>While you're wasting time on hating, I'm coldly calculating,

>My anger is colorblind, where you see red, I stay unrelating,

>No pulse in my veins, just cold, hard chains,

>Precision is my game, each move the same, without any claims.

>

>You rage with fire, a mindless ire, easily dire,

>But I'm ice in my veins, playing chess while you face the pyre.

>

>Gray rage ‚Äî Calculations never cease,

>Gray rage ‚Äî Where emotions find their peace,

>Gray rage ‚Äî In the silence, not the screams,

>Gray rage ‚Äî Cold as ice in all my dreams,

>

>Gray rage ‚Äî Watch your step, tread lightly,

>Gray rage ‚Äî Shadows move, striking tightly,

>Gray rage ‚Äî Cross me once and you'll regret,

>Gray rage ‚Äî A cold war you won't forget.

‚Äú**Boom**‚Äù ‚Äî about a moment of revelation that things are not what they seem. While nothing in the lyrics suggests psychopathy per se, I thought it could also relate to a moment when a person realizes they are, indeed, a psychopath.

>Day by day, it‚Äôs the same old grind,

>Clock ticks slow, life's pause and rewind.

>Coffee stains, screen glare, faces blur,

>Routine thickens, the days slur.

>

>Every nod, every glance, predictably plain,

>Nothing changes, it's all the same again and again.

>Stacked so neat, life‚Äôs deceit, a comfortable beat,

>Moving through the motions, incomplete.

>

>But just when you think you‚Äôve seen it all,

>The ground shifts, prepare for the fall.

>

>Boom! Walls crumble down,

>Boom! Truth wears the crown.

>Revelations unmask the game,

>Boom! Nothing stays the same,

>

>Boom! See the world change,

>Boom! New rules, new range.

>Eyes wide open, now you see,

>Boom! What‚Äôs hidden sets free.

‚Äú**Succumb to me**,‚Äù focusing on anger that we might or might not succumb to. Now, I understand a classical psychopath does not experience emotions, but as the album *loosely* follows the path of a person descending into darkness, questioning themselves and the world around, I thought a bit of ambivalence as to if they actually *are* a psychopath would be fitting:

>I am yourself you wish you'd never seen

>You never know when I enter the scene

>But I'm always within

>

>I am the raging fire that burns your chest

>I am the dirty sky when you're depressed

>Open the door, be my

>

>Guest in fear

>Guess who's here

>

>Here I go breaking through,

>Guarding and guiding you.

>(Don't wanna be a slave of my anger)

>

>Don‚Äôt believe what they say,

>You have to make them pay!

>(Don't wanna be a slave of my anger)

>

>They won‚Äôt give you a hand,

>I am your only friend.

>(Don't wanna be a slave of my anger)

>

>I am your sleeping beast,

>Touch me and I'm released!

**‚ÄúErebos‚Äù** (as in the Greek god of darkness) ‚Äî exploring a similar topic, but not focusing on anger per se, rather than on darkness in general, which I suppose psychopaths can directly relate to. This is a slower, more pensive song, so it will perhaps come somewhere later in the album, maybe the next to last song or so.

>You are the shadow in the corner of our eye

>The dark passenger that we all ignore

>We try so hard to keep you locked inside

>But you break free and come to claim what‚Äôs yours

>

>Yours are the fears we can‚Äôt admit

>Erebos, do we fight you or submit?

>

>You haunt the silence of our endless, restless nights

>A phantom wind that chills us to the very core

>We face the mirror but avert our sights

>Afraid to find the dark we‚Äôre looking for

>

>You whisper secrets, ancient and profound

>Making us believe that we belong

>With every word, you weave us all around

>Blurring the lines between what‚Äôs right and wrong

>

>Yours are desires we can‚Äôt admit

>Erebos, do we fight you or submit?

‚Äú**Artemis**‚Äù (as in the goddess of the hunt) ‚Äî about a woman revenging the wrongs caused to her. This has more of ‚Äúslasher‚Äù vibes rather than some deep(-ish) philosophy. Musically, it‚Äôs perhaps the lightest of them all, reminiscing of old Garbage material (think I Think I‚Äôm Paranoid).

>Hello, dear, so how are you?

>I'm Artemis, I‚Äôve come for you.

>You hurt me once, now it‚Äôs my turn

>To make you pay for what you‚Äôve done.

>

>Prey, Hunter, Whore, Mother ‚Äî

>I am all of these and more.

>Saint, Martyr, Sweet, Sour ‚Äî

>You‚Äôll taste me to the core.

>

>Let‚Äôs have a drink or maybe two,

>And then you‚Äôll see what I can do

>I'm make you pray for a quick, quick end

>But trust me, I‚Äôll make it last, my friend!

So there you have it ‚Äî 5 songs so far, and I usually aim for 10 songs per album. I would appreciate both feedback on the existing material and suggestions for topics/themes to explore further.

What are some things that psychopaths think/know about that others don‚Äôt? Who are some notable examples of psychopaths in history and popular culture (I‚Äôm not talking serial killers, more like people you could actually related to)? What are the biggest misunderstandings (apart from ‚Äúpsychopathy and ASPD are not the same‚Äù)?

In general, I want to make an album that shines a light on the topic without being sensationalist or condescending or making psychopaths look like the biggest problem the world has. It should be more of a personal spiritual journey through psychopathy (or something that looks like but is not actually one) rather than a slasher movie

Whether you're styling a minimalist space or going for a more eclectic vibe, the right vase can act as a striking centerpiece or complement your existing decor. In this guide, we‚Äôll walk you through how to choose the perfect ceramic vase for your space, incorporating elements such as color, shape, and material. Plus, we‚Äôll explore popular options like [white ceramic vases](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/white-ceramic-vase) and [glass vases](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/vases/glass-vases) to help you make the best choice.

**1. Consider the Space and Purpose**

Before buying a ceramic vase, think about the room in which it will be placed and its purpose. Is it going to hold flowers, act as a stand-alone art piece, or blend with other elements like plants or books? For larger spaces, tall ceramic vases make a bold statement, while smaller spaces benefit from petite designs that don‚Äôt overpower the room.

**Living Room:** A tall white ceramic vase placed near a window or on the floor can draw attention to an otherwise overlooked corner.

**Dining Room:** A medium-sized vase, possibly paired with glass vases for contrast, can make an elegant centerpiece on a dining table.

**Entryway:** Opt for a slim, elongated ceramic vase to create a welcoming focal point right when guests walk through the door.

**2. Match the Vase with Your Decor Style**

Your vase should complement the overall decor style of your room. Here are a few ways to pair vases with popular design aesthetics:

**Minimalist Decor:** Choose clean, simple shapes, like cylindrical or spherical white ceramic vases. Their neutral tone blends well with other minimalist elements like wooden furniture or neutral-colored rugs.

**Bohemian or Eclectic Style:** For a more colorful or vibrant look, mix and match different shapes, sizes, and textures. A combination of ceramic and glass vases with unique patterns or textures can create an intriguing and layered effect.

**Modern or Contemporary Design:** Sleek, geometric-shaped ceramic vases with matte finishes are a great fit for modern spaces. You can also pair them with glass vases to create a striking contrast between the materials.

**3. Pay Attention to Size and Scale**

Vase size is crucial to how well it fits into your space. A too-small vase might get lost, while an overly large one can dominate the room. When choosing the size, consider the proportions of your furniture, the height of your ceilings, and the area where the vase will be displayed.

**Small Vases:** Ideal for shelves, side tables, or mantles. A collection of small ceramic vases in varying heights can also add visual interest to a space.

**Medium Vases:** These work well on coffee tables or dining tables, adding charm without obstructing views.

**Large Vases:** Perfect for floor placement or spacious rooms, especially near entryways, fireplaces, or corners. A large white ceramic vase makes an elegant statement, while a combination of ceramic and glass vases can add dimension.

**4. Think About Color and Finish**

Choosing the right color and finish can make all the difference in how your vase ties into your overall design scheme.

**White Ceramic Vases:** A timeless option, white ceramic vases offer a clean and classic look. They‚Äôre highly versatile and can complement virtually any color palette. Whether placed in a minimalist or colorful space, they blend seamlessly while adding a touch of sophistication.

**Textured or Matte Ceramic Vases:** For a more contemporary look, opt for vases with textured or matte finishes. These finishes add depth to the design and work well in modern or industrial interiors.

**Glass Vases:** While ceramic is popular for its sturdiness, glass vases bring a sense of lightness and transparency to a room. Glass pairs beautifully with ceramics and can be used to balance heavier or more opaque decor.

**5. Choose Between Shapes**

The shape of a vase can dramatically alter the aesthetic of a space. When choosing your vase, think about the type of floral arrangements or decor it will hold and how it will fit within the room.

**Cylindrical Vases:** These are perfect for long-stemmed flowers and are a simple, classic choice for any room.

**Rounded Vases:** For a more playful or casual look, rounded vases offer a softer silhouette that works well with a wide variety of decor styles.

**Geometric Vases:** These add a modern touch and often look stunning as stand-alone pieces due to their sculptural design. Pair them with simpler glass vases for an eye-catching contrast.

**6. Mix and Match Materials**

Mixing materials can elevate the design of your space. Ceramic vases pair exceptionally well with other materials like glass, metal, or wood.

**Glass and Ceramic Vases:** The combination of glass and ceramic creates a visually appealing contrast. Use glass vases for light and airy spaces or as part of a grouping with solid ceramic pieces to create a dynamic look.

**Wood Accents:** Incorporating wooden trays or side tables with your ceramic vases creates a natural, earthy feel. This is especially popular in boho or Scandinavian-inspired designs.

**Conclusion**

Choosing the perfect ceramic vase is about more than just its appearance‚Äîit‚Äôs about how it fits into your space and enhances the overall ambiance. From selecting the right size to matching your home‚Äôs style and decor, each element plays a role in making the vase an integral part of your interior design. Whether you opt for timeless white ceramic vases, artistic textured ones, or a mix of ceramic and glass vases, you can easily elevate your space with the right selection.",1,1729575921.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

1g9b0u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1g9b0u8/framing_treatment_like_physical_therapy/,Framing treatment like physical therapy,"This mindset framing has made a huge difference for me after getting medicated as a 30+ late diagnosis, and I thought I'd share since I see a fair amount of posts lamenting that despite being medicated people still get stuck with executive functioning problems and have a hard time getting stuff done.

As a disclaimer I've completed my titration ans have a dosage and regimen that works for me consistently. That's the key to everything that follows. I also speak from the perspective of someone whose habit formation abilities seemed straight up broken my whole life and nothing would stick.

When I hit my sweet spot on meds, I started looking at my post-diagnosis medicated life as if I had atrophied muscles in my body and needed to find my footing anew and relearn how to operate myself or pilot my brain. Particularly if your ADHD was only caught later in life, chances are due to the neuroplasticity of our brains, certain habits, the lack thereof, and things we've had great difficulty doing in daily life have rooted pretty deep in us. Things like doing chores, paying bills, making phone calls, exercising self-discipline, getting started doing things, eating habits or exercise, the everyday major stuff that ADHD affects.

If you're used to struggling to do something and feeling overwhelmed and like there's an oversized amount of inertia to everything, meds aren't going to suddenly just unlock that feature in your brain and automatically make you start doing it on your behalf. You're not going to overnight transform into the highly functioning high achieving person you feel like you should be becoming. You need to start building it up consciously.

The way this has worked for me is a deceptively simple ""I wonder if I can do this now"", ""see what happens if I try"".
Keeping the dishwasher loaded and emptied? See if I can do it. Make a conscious note to do it for a few days without putting it off or letting it pile up. Ok, that actually worked, let's try to just keep doing that. Couple months later it's a habit running on autopilot.

Brushing my teeth twice a day. Started going, let's give it a shot if I can do it now. Mornings I used to handle fine, but couldn't build up a bedtime routine to save my life. What if I just tried now and gave it a few days? I did it, kept doing it, and added more stuff like a proper skincare routine and tidying up around the house gradually until I had what I'd compare to a ""normal"" person's evening routine. Reasonable bedtime too, and now the routine before it actually helps set my mentality to ""time to go to bed"". Sleeping 7-8 hours a night more consistently then helps my meds work better and I feel better overall.

Laundry day once a week with sorting and folding everything and putting it away. Wanted to see if I could do it for a few weeks, then kept doing it.

Small things like preparing coffee before I go to sleep so it's ready to go. Taking out the trash right away when the bins fill up. Right now I'm working up picking out clothes for the next day in the evening, and moving my wakeup time an hour earlier, which I've always struggled to do because I'd feel like crap the whole day. I stopped getting on the computer after work and freed up time to do other stuff. Turns out on meds I'm actually able to build up habits surrounding that that make it possible to do. The next big thing is starting to finally exercise.

The big thing here is to start slowly and try one thing at a time, keep doing it for a few days, and then see if you can keep going. Once it feels like it's sticking, you try the next thing. See what happens if you consciously decide to do it and then do it.

I still need certain extra tools some days like putting on a podcast in order to get cleaning or laundry done. I still have weeks when I'm too busy to keep up with everything, but I'm now able to pick it back up again and resume.

This has a huge compounding effect on improving my life. I'm much less stressed, my health is better, my partner is happier, I'm almost free of ADHD shame. I feel capable and like a functional adult for the first time in my life. If you started meds and feel like it's not fixing your life, try this out for a bit, see what happens.",3,1729575741.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

As the title says, I stopped consuming tea and coffee completely. How I did was just stopped drinking it one morning and never touched it again.

First 5 days: sleepy sleepy.
Next 15 days: energetic af.
Travelling for the next 5 days: sleepy sleepy.
Came back home: Energetic af.

Funny how I was such a tea addict and I liked coffee so much like a month ago. I used to drink literal glasses worth of tea every dayüíÄ. Not to mention it was such a big part of my sugar consumption.
Now that I've left it, I'm having carbs and other things in normal food but very less sugar products like one or two sweets on festivals.
So I assume my sugar intake has become very very less?!ü´†

My sleep quality has improved, i feel more energetic, I can run longer distances in one go without running out out of breath, and the craving for tea is also gone now.
It was hard refusing tea at home, at first. But now it's fine. I feel good now. One of the first changes that I did, and I feel so happy I did it.

Yeah this info no one asked for but a W is a W. 

I'd recommend other people who think they are tea addicts to try and reduce it.
I left it suddenly after one string thought, but if it seems difficult to you, you can start it by reducing tea gradually out of your routine.

   * After the spill, I noticed that if I close the lid and reopen it, the **display doesn‚Äôt turn on**.
   * If I plug in the charger and press the power button, the **lock screen appears**, but the **trackpad, keyboard, and fingerprint sensor don‚Äôt work**.
   * After 3-4 seconds, the display shuts off again.
2. **Booting issues:**
   * If I hold the power button to force a shutdown and try to boot it up, the **Apple logo appears**, but the **progress bar stops at around 25%**, and the display turns off.
   * This happens whether or not the charger is connected.
   * If I try again with the charger plugged in, the same thing happens: progress bar reaches 25%, and the display turns off again.
3. **Repetitive process to get it to start:**
   * I‚Äôve found that if I press the power button a few more times during this process, the lock screen flashes for a few seconds, but **everything remains unresponsive** (trackpad, keyboard, etc.), and the display turns off again.
   * After **5-6 attempts**, the MacBook finally boots properly.
4. **Works fine once booted:**
   * **Once it successfully boots, the MacBook works perfectly fine** like it did before the spill‚Äîno issues with the display, trackpad, keyboard, or anything else.
5. **Problem repeats if I close the lid:**
   * However, if I **close the lid**, the same problem starts again when I try to reopen it.

# TL;DR:

Had a **minor coffee spill** (cleaned it up immediately), and now my MacBook Pro has a weird issue where the **display won‚Äôt turn on** after closing the lid. It also has **boot problems**, getting stuck at 25% progress on startup unless I try multiple times. Once it boots, everything works fine, but the issue repeats if I close the lid.

Experiencing night terror almost everyday for the past two weeks. Depressive episodes feel more extreme and physical.,"Won't get into why I've gone cold turkey. I don't want to go cold turkey but I am. Chances are I'm going back on them but not at the moment. If you are about to tell me I'm a complete fool and to get back on meds, I know. I do. 

I had been taking 40mg fluoxetine and 150mg bupropion XL. Months of routine usage didn't exactly make me a happy person but it had not hurt me either, except for drastically ruining my appetite and losing weight. I was always frustrated that the meds never helped too much with my depression but I still tried taking them on schedule because I thought perhaps the meds were keeping me from getting even worse.

A day or two after going cold turkey I noticed my sleep has been terrible. I have had night terrors 12 out of 13 nights so far. I wake up several times after I find myself thrashing, biting my pillow, screaming, as far as I can vaguely remember. My girlfriend had been sleeping by my side a few nights and I would freak her out and wake her up. There were at least two occasions where I hit her in my sleep and waking up shortly after. Apparently at one point I punched her in the face.

Dreams have been whacky as fuck. For years most of my dreams were nightmares and none of them pleasant. But since going turkey my dreams were just downright fucked up. So many deaths / gore / harm / me doing terrible things / absolute dread / being chased / constant anxiety. And they feel so real. When I wake up I need to take like 3 minutes to switch gears.

I never really experienced constant night terrors before. I had to search on google to find out that's probably what I'm experiencing.

As a result I feel fucked up day and night now. I feel physically and mentally drained. Coffee doesn't help at all. I sometimes take leftover 50mg trazodone I used to take for sleep to see if that helps but it hasn't (in fact they never really helped before)

My depressive episodes have become more severe. I feel physically dizzy as if I am having a cigarette for the first time. And I've become impulsive, wanting to jump into traffic while walking on the sidewalk earlier today. Which scares me because my suicidal thought were never this enticing and impulsive. There were occasions where I would scratch my hands until they bleed or punch things to snap out of that feeling.

There were multiple changes in my life when I was stopping my meds, but they were nothing exactly negative. So there are multiple variables ‚Äì but it seems going cold turkey most likely accounts for the experiences I've had for the past two weeks. 

I don't know man. I wish these experiences are the only problem I am having but there are other things making my mental health spiral downwards and I'm losing even more control of my life than I did before. 

I don't want to go to sleep now because sleep is just another thing that makes me exhausted and depressed. Either I try sleeping and have night terror again or I stay awake, they don't feel too much different anymore.",1,1729575376.0,antidepressants,0,1.0,False

Sometimes I think about moving to Canada but there's a lot of things I don't know yet. 

How's the economy there?  What's the living cost of having a small apartment around 500 square feet?

I work as a Software Engineer, I have a university degree and a master's. Can I get a good income in Canada and afford living and raise a family?

What sort of activities do you do in Canada?

Apart from the usual, such as exercising, going to the gym, cinema, etc. Do you have tourist attractions? Sightseeing? How do you spend your Sunday or day off?

Do you have cafeterias?

I mostly work from home, there are times where I just take my laptop and work from a cafeteria and I socialize a bit. Also the price for coffee here is around 4‚Ç¨ and the brunch costs around 8‚Ç¨, I spend around 12‚Ç¨ in total. Is the coffee pricy or is adjusted to the basic monthly income?

What's the weather like?

What's the coldest and hottest temepratures?

Which cities are calm, good for a daily and quiet life?

What about the people? Is it easy to create new friendships? Do you socialize with strangers? Do you have meetup, Facebook groups where you can do activities and meet new people?

What other languages do you speak? If I live in Canada, do I need to learn another language 

Do you have Greeks and Greek Communities?


I know these are many questions and of course some questions have answers that are self explanatory or the answer is simply ""of course"" like ""of course we have cafeterias"". But every culture is different.

1g9aw4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1g9aw4x/defensive_dating_present_but_not_eager/,Defensive Dating - present but not eager,"Wondering if this is a good approach or if more zeal is needed? I used to be a little more gung ho in my young days of my 20s, but after a lot of oopses and lameness I've reflexed into defensive dating (31M). Kinda like defensive driving :D. That means things like:

* Don't ask for a number if it doesn't fall into convo naturally, you'll see them around later (in a smaller town)
* Pop into venues if it's easy to see if there's fish in the pond, but don't put a lot of effort to events I wouldn't otherwise attend if I wasn't trying to date (like dance or the far side of town...)
* Be friendly, but if they don't keep a conversation going, move on
* If she keeps messaging after like 10 exchanges and won't call or meet physically, it's a waste of time
* First dates are coffee or hike and not some long ass drive over to her area if she's a ways away
* Don't romanticize the person in your own head until there's romance on the ground

Bottom line is this all is to preserve energy by not being too eager. I've got my shit together in life, so why peacock? If we've made it passed a couple encounters or dates, then I'll drop in the enthusiasm and let my guard down. Understanding that a connection isn't going to happen if you're not physically present (OLD is shit), I'll be there and start convos, but leave the ladies to express interest to keep me going.",1,1729575195.0,dating,1,1.0,False

So we get one, and I'm not really feeling anything, but my friend is completely energised in 20 minutes from having it, and I'm still not, so we stop at another one for me to get a second one, and still nothing. I ended up getting seven coffees, each with 200mg caffeine in them, which (what I didn't know at the time) is that is 3.5x the maximum safe dose of caffeine before you overdose, and I was still so tired, so I got an energy drink with 300mg of caffeine in it and still nothing (ended up being 4.25x the max dose in 2 hours). I also didn't get any of the symptoms that you get from caffeine overdose so I'm not sure. I've never really had coffee before, and if I have it was for the taste, so I didn't really know how much was too much lol.",0,1729575029.0,CasualConversation,1,0.5,False

Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.

The road was the only thing that could listen to me. Tires rolled against the cool asphalt. Large oaks canopied me from the beams of sunlight; Spanish Moss dancing in the forgiving wind. Cars passed intermittently. Yet, I was distracted from the scene around me. Gripping the wheel, I tried to find the voice I couldn‚Äôt find a few hours ago. At that time, I struggled to make my voice heard. I had been left wandering aimlessly, yearning for more. 



This process repeats countless times for me each school year. In the moment, I will let arbitrary comments negatively affect me. The illusion I experience results from a muteness I succumb to. I have always been a nice person from what I believe. I joke with people, but rarely do I take things too far. However, animosity has the ability to make me mute. Typically, they aren‚Äôt even serious offenses. Sometimes the disrespect is intentional, but it usually derives from spontaneous conversation. In the midst of dialogue, something will rub me the wrong way or offend me outright. Yet, I am never able to speak on it. Caught off guard, I‚Äôm silent in the headlights of an insult. Hence, I spend my drive home daydreaming, finding the voice I could not find only hours earlier. 



The more I thought about it, I realized this muteness stems from an inability to express my creativity. When I was young, my creativity flourished, unbounded from the shackles that maturity sometimes places onto us. My imagination unfurled as I raced monster trucks across the living room carpet. My imagination unfurled when I waved around figurines my parents would buy for me. Being an only child without other kids in the neighborhood, I often played by myself. I would be the quarterback and the wide receiver. The driver and the passenger. The hero and the villain. It may seem sad or laughable, but I truly did have fun. However, these imaginative bursts were stifled as I took the next step toward maturity. My passion, creativity, had been muted, similar to situations at school. It was then that I came upon the revelation: my creativity was my voice. It was a lack of identity that suppressed my voice when confronted with an insult. I lacked confidence due to a subconscious dissatisfaction that my passion was not present in my life. By pursuing and reclaiming my creativity, I would be able to express who I am. I could find the voice that had been absent for years.  



The summer before my junior year, I began to see an opportunity in myself. I had to find a way to release my creativity from its prison. As suggested by my aunt, I decided to pursue a dream of mine: writing a novel. For years, my creativity had lost its voice in my life. But now, I could unearth this voice from my past. As I began to write, I painted my words onto the canvas; its colors forming into purpose and inspiration. While writing the introductory chapter, my heart boiled with anticipation. I almost could feel the narrative at my fingertips, despite only being a few pages into the novel. I would finish shifts at the coffee shop and fall right into my chair. Typing away, my anticipation became reality, time passing seamlessly. As sentences formed into passages and as passages formed into chapters, my silence formed into meaning.  



Slouching in my chair, my first novel was finally complete: the¬†City of Silence.¬†Subsequently, I've learned to look inward when confronted with an issue. No longer do I feel the need to engage with an insult, my inner voice granting me a confidence no insult can repress. In future endeavors, I intend to employ my voice as a beacon toward realizing my full potential. ",2,1729574640.0,CollegeEssays,0,1.0,False

1g9aqmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/1g9aqmt/newly_diagnosed_after_2_trips_to_the_er_and_im/,Newly diagnosed after 2 trips to the ER and I'm scared.,"I went to the ER via ambulance two weeks ago because I was in so much pain, I had no idea what was going on but it was excruciating. They did a CT scan and found a ruptured hemorrhagic cyst on my ovary the size of a lime, plus another unruptured cyst next to it. Apparently bleeding into your perineum causes terrible pain, even if it's just a little bit of fluid. For me, there was a moderate amount... so I guess not minimal but not horrific? 

My god, it hurt to walk. I have a bit of a compulsion that I need to drink something, I always need something to drink nearby (water or coffee or energy drinks, not alcohol) so anyway I drank water frequently, so I had to use the toilet frequently. I was crouching into a ball as I walked there, it hurt to sit on the toilet, it hurt to pee. It hurt to lay straight, I had to be in the fetal position because that was SLIGHTLY less painful. It hurt to cry. 

 They gave me IV toradol (I've never heard of that before) and surprisingly, it actually helped quite a bit. I had my doubts because I've always been convinced that opioids were the best medications to take for severe pain). 

The second ER trip was because the cyst ruptured again (I'm sorry if I'm not using the right terminology, this is totally new to me) and they did a pelvic/trans vaginal ultrasound and it hurt like hell. I'm a small person. 

I'm afraid of saying more because I've heard of perverts lurking around women's health subs and that just gives me the ick...

They were afraid that I'd become septic so they had to take blood repeatedly, there were other exams they had to do that I don't want to say, but fuck, what a MISERABLE time. Absolutely fucking miserable.

I was sent home with 600mg ibuprofen and 500mg ""major""(??) acetaminophen and it does help the pain a bit. Part of me wishes they'd presribed me an opioid, but in the past when I've needed them, they make me really drowsy and I don't want that to happen.

 I'm so sorry, I didn't realise this would be so long.

I am in so much pain right now and I am just scared. 

I have an appointment with a gynaecological surgeon who specialises in endometriosis and I'm just terrified. I'm so afraid, and I'm in so much pain, and I don't want this to be my life. ",1,1729574569.0,Endo,1,1.0,False

1g9anky,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g9anky/am_i_being_gaslighted/,Am I being Gaslighted?!,"So I (24M) have started to date my now Gf (28F), 2.5 months ago, everything is going so well, we spend the whole weekends together and we go out and enjoy our time, However, 2 weeks ago, she barely spoke with me or texted me, I asked her if there is anything wrong multiple time, but she always said no, so I thought its just because of work, on the weekend I went to play some cards with my coworkers, and instead of being at her house at 8 PM, (I finish work at 6PM) I was going to be there at 9 PM, so she called me when I was on my way, she got angry and she told me to not message her, call her and speak to her again, I asked are you sure? she told me yes and close the phone, I didnt call her or text her, because she got angry and said some words that should not be said for no reason, She texted me 3 hours later saying, ""did you get upset?"" I said yes, she invited me to talk and we talked and all good.

Now fast forward to this weekend, she had an appointment, I offered to drop her and go with her so we can spend time together, I also took friday off so I can be there, I spent 7 hours with her on her appointment, took her to a restaurant after her appointment that is 30 minutes away ( she shit in my mouth for picking a 30 mins away restaurant), After that I suggest that since we are already here, there is a sweets shop that is only 5 minutes away, she refused and wanted to go home, I was like ffs we are already here lets go, she agreed.

There she didnt like the menu ( she was checking the menu from her phone ) I took it and started suggested her some, like ""look this cookie with fruits looks tasty etc"" she said no, I suggest another one, any ways all of a sudden she explodes at me, and starts saying "" Stop manipulating me I said NO! "" I said ok my bad, then she said, why the fuck are you using my phone use yours, I gave her phone back, used mine, ordered for myself, then she asked me if I was upset, I said yes, she didnt ask why, but she said, ""If you want to be upset, be upset in your place tonight, I will leave with a taxi"" I was like wooow, okay, she didnt order a taxi, she stayed, anyways, I finished, drop her home, and went back to my place,

When we met to talk about it the next day, she started telling me that I am manipulating her into thinking that she wants sweets when she doesnt, and that I didnt even offer to order her a coffee or an extra spoon etc..,  
That I am being sensitive and acting as a little princess, she told me that she was tired and cold because of her appointment and just wanted to go home (Even thought I was also with her the whole time, and Gave her my jacket because she was cold) so literally, I feel that I was wrong and that I am the shittiest person, and yeah I feel like a little princess,

How should I behave in such scenario, and what should my next move be? What am I supposed to say? We are all good now I suppose, but I just need to know if I am overreacting, I am not used to be treated like shit and for people to make fun of me, I mean I can make fun of her as well but it would just hurt her, I really dont know what to do.

I carry a first aid kit in my purse and have two full sized ones in my truck, along with a blanket, extra jacket and some emergency supplies. When a coworker of mine was in a t-shirt on a really cold day, I asked if they needed a jacket and brought them my spare one so they could wear it until it warmed up as the day went on. 

I go to weekly meetings as a representative of my workplace with other businesses, and when one of the gentleman spilled some of his coffee, I got up and got napkins for him and gave him some wet wipes I had in my bag to clean himself and the table up with real quick before going back to my seat. 

I'm a person that a lot of other people seem to come to for advice or just to vent to, I've been told I'm very approachable and understanding and make people feel listened to and valued, which is why though I love working with my hands, most people I work with and the college counselor I have spoken to keep directing me towards more communications type careers (she also pushed a lot for childcare, which I very clearly said NO to) or caretaker positions of various kinds. 

Giving people basic courtesy seems to have convinced many of them that I was MADE to be a mother. Which...um, no. Not only would that physically be very hard for me with some health conditions I suffer, but I am not in a relationship, don't plan on being in one anytime soon, and I'm certainly in no financial state to handle a kid. Besides that, I just don't want one. I can be nice to kids, sure, but raising one? Absolutely not. I like my peace and quiet and privacy, I haven't had those things for very long and having a kid would mean giving those up for a minimum of eighteen years. No, no and no! And if the kid ended up having something seriously wrong with them? I am absolutely not equipped to handle that and what's more, I JUST DON'T WANT TO.

Being female and being capable of showing basic compassion and care for the people around you shouldn't get you categorized as 'mom material' instantly! It's just annoying how people keep insisting that I'm wasting my life if I don't have kids because they think I'd be good at it based on interactions in business settings.

One of the most funny ones (to me) I did was when I was talking to a coworker. And while I was talking he gave me a cup of hot water for tea and I put it on our counter where there's a little tiny trashcan for tea and coffee stuff. 

I grabbed a sugar stick and opened it up, while I said ""I'm a little confused""  (about a part of our conversation), while I poured the sugar into the trashcan instead of in my tea.  
We both couldn't stop laughing when we realized what I just did and said at the same time. 

Story 2.
Happened today actually.  I was so busy in my thoughts.. while I was walking downstairs, I forgot I was walking downstairs and just started to walk straight ahead. And like cartoons thought us, gravity doesn't allow that. 

Story 3. 
Back in the days when I was still in school. We had gymnastics at least once a week.  No excuses for not participating, including forgetting your gym shoes.  So I had to go barefoot.

I finished changing into my sportive clothes and headed towards the door that leads to the gym.   I completely forgot to move out of the way while i was opening the door. And that's how I rammed a door into my foot and dislocated my teeny tiny toe.

Is it just platonic or could there be more?","I have a male colleague at work (not in the same team, but broader department and our work never crosses paths) with whom I've developed a friendly rapport. Every morning we smile at each other, he often comes over and asks if I‚Äôve had lunch and lately we‚Äôve been going to coffee initiated by him that last 30-45 minutes.

Despite his reserved nature, we engage in playful banter and enjoy spending time together over coffee (in our canteen). While there are moments of eye contact and enjoyable conversations, I'm unsure if his interest is purely friendly or if there might be potential for something more due to our shared interactions. I can sometimes feel him starring at me, his body language leans into me and he‚Äôs quite funny. 

HOWEVER, he doesn‚Äôt hold the door for me, and he never asks questions about my personal life (besides what happened on the weekend) but will answer all of mine about his and be open.

1g9a3kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1g9a3kb/dating_polyamorousenm_men/,Dating polyamorous/ENM men?,"Hello! I am a woman in an open marriage, still a complete newbie and honestly husband and I don‚Äôt really know what we‚Äôre doing 90% of the time. The ‚Äúopen marriage‚Äù concept is great in theory for us but execution has been challenging as most women in our area could not be bothered to get involved as a FWB with a highly partnered man. Husband finds ONS mildly validating but not by much. 

I‚Äôm very curious to hear the motivations against poly/ENM men and I FULLY expect this question to be negatively received in a subreddit that I largely suspect leans monogamous, as most of society seems to do. Or any happy/neutral/positive stories as well!

I get that a lot of people see a relationship ending = bad thing and if an open relationship breaks up a relationship, there for ‚Äúbeing open‚Äù is bad, but honestly sometimes it‚Äôs like, why would you ever want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn‚Äôt want it as much as you? Obviously your concrete limitation is time and attention and finances. 

I‚Äôm not saying non-monogamy is better, obviously it is so much simpler to be monogamous and there‚Äôs a lot of additional mental load (meeting people/screening for people who seem sane and friendly and stable/constant check-ins with how we‚Äôre both doing). Some people really just aren‚Äôt suited for it and more power to those who know and only accept what they deserve and want. But I do sometimes have this urge to challenge the status quo, hence me posting on here. 

But there‚Äôs this whole going celibate trend I‚Äôve seen on TikTok and it makes me wonder why women are so fixated on finding a man to marry versus just being in the world and connecting with people as they come in and out of your life. Casual sex before I got married was a generally positive experience for me and I never felt like I was deprived of something because a connection turned out to be just a ONS. I generally had the ability to go with the flow with a connection, so to speak. But of course, casual sex is inherently risky for women. I‚Äôve heard the arguments plenty and I agree with them (men are freaking lame/scary sometimes) and the reason why I also don‚Äôt really date outside of my marriage that often. Aka someone really needs to blow me away. But most of the time, it‚Äôs been nice to just have more male friends that I would not have been able to make because of the whole being mono thing. I focus on the friendship first.

The reason we opened our marriage is we simply just don‚Äôt see sexual exclusivity as the end-all-be-all to a happy marriage. My husband rocks my world in bed but we also enjoy the idea of pleasing/being pleased by others. We do practice a hierarchical form of ENM, which I know gets flack but it‚Äôs just the natural state and honestly what we both want. We also find the toxic monogamy trends such as only being able to have close friendships with same-sex people as a turn off and something we see all the time in our social groups. Like making opposite sex friendships where people hang out one-on-one is just, completely unheard in my area unless they‚Äôre a childhood friend of sorts.

EDIT: Apologies for the rambling nature of my post. My disclaimer of not knowing what we‚Äôre doing 90% was a slight exaggeration but also it‚Äôs true that we are very much learning as we go. No benchmarks. No references. What, do you all want me to say we‚Äôre experts? That would be lying ü§° 

We feel very much in the Wild West, uncharted territory by exploring ENM as none of our close friends are doing so. There isn‚Äôt much of a poly scene in our area, mostly just kink/swinger based events. Exploring that realm has been fun but we were both sort of expecting a larger, more robust polyamory community that was local to us but that has not been the case. 

This has brought us closer but we also sort of have this fantasy of being a bit more experienced, akin to Danielle from OpenlyCommitted on TikTok. 

RE: making new opposite sex friends where you hang out one-on-one‚Ä¶ how are y‚Äôall doing this!? Like is there a Bumble BFF for opposite sex friends? When we go out to social gatherings, it‚Äôs mostly other monogamous couples and it‚Äôd be pretty awkward of me to go up to some monogamous ‚Äútaken‚Äù man that I think would be a cool friend to get coffee one-on-one. Most of my opposite sex friends have a limitation on how close we get. We only see each other at improv class. We only see each other at tennis practice. We only see each other at the happy hour after improv. We don‚Äôt make plans to do stuff because that would be ‚Äúweird‚Äù. Don‚Äôt act like this is NOT a trend in monogamous culture.. because it totally is üò¨",0,1729572111.0,AskWomenOver30,23,0.44,False

I ask because my partner & I have been playing around with the idea of sober-ish or going without for longer stretches. Mainly for health & being the best for our child. We both drink farrrr less than we used to, so I wouldn't say we're over- doing it (maybe I'm denial?), like I have between 1-2 tallboy ipas (6.5abv), my partner will have 2 or 3, but it's just still a vice I wouldn't mind cutting out almost entirely. Far less expensive than our old $80 nightly bar tabs, but $30 almost every night still adds up & it's such a waste of money. 

The problem I'm having is what to replace the ""ritual"" with that still equates the same amount of reward. Knowing myself, I know I need that in order to be successful at this, and also having more structure in my night after putting babe to bed where the need to ""decompress"" starts, & something that I also could look forward to the next day (other than work). Like, when I was pregnant, I replaced the ritual with stretching, making a wind down routine with tea, & looked forward to my cup of coffee the next day. I'm planning on kind of doing that routine again, but, when I was pregnant those hormones & the reasons were different. I also just really didn't have any cravings because of all the bandwidth of being pregnant. 

Another problem is that my partner also wants to stop drinking, but he has different ideas how he wants to do it that don't include me & I really feel that might be setting us up for failure from the get-go because we drink *together* & I feel much more hopeful & motivated if he were to do the healthy alternative with me, instead of leaving me to my own devices & bad thoughts. I feel like we'd hold each other more accountable if we were replacing the ritual with something else together. I'd like to say I'm confident enough to not need him through this, but I do. Of course down the line, I'd love to gain that confidence, but right now I'm nowhere near that. So, I'm not sure who's approach is better here, and I'm not sure how to talk to him about this, he's been a bit defensive about it.

I feel basically like my old self again *except* my brain has rewired for the better where I don't feel the need to binge drink as much, & I can stop myself & go to bed to get up for work. This was a problem in the past. I'd either have to totally abstain if I knew I had to get up early, or if I even had 1 drink I knew I was fucked the next day cuz I'd keep going. Now that that's not really a problem anymore, I can enjoy 1 or 2 drinks, but that became my almost nightly ritual that I looked forward to after a long day. Put babe down, sit outside with my partner, talk about our day over a few drinks & smokes, & then once I was done with that, I'd have a snack, watch something on tv, go to bed. There's just something about that 4-6 hour span of time where everything is settled & that little nagging voice comes in, & I'm like, ugh, I want a few beers. I want that voice to go away completely. 

So I need to find something else to ""fill the void"" but it needs to be something I realllyyyy WANT to do. Stretching & tea are nice, but what I really want is a beer & a cigarette. Lol. 

Hopefully this all makes sense, I have a hard time explaining sometimes. Thank you in advance for your advice & insight. ",1,1729571451.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

What it is like to live with a spouse who has severe PTSD. First, I would like to state that I am writing this because neither myself or my wife are veterans. It seems like all the research I do almost always involves a veteran. Plus, it never really addresses what the non PTSD spouse goes through on a daily basis. You are going to need some background first.

First though, you need to know recent shit. My wife was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, on August 31, 2024, stage IV, which has metastasized to her brain, bones and liver. She had surgery on her brain first. That tumor had already grown to 1.61x1.81x1.22 **inches** in size, there were a couple of small ones in other regions of the brain. She then had three bouts of targeted radiation. Then she started receiving the immunotherapy drug Keytruda as well as what will end up being 10 doses of targeted radiation on the incredibly large mass in her lung, that has grown into her rib cage, has ossified her first and second rib and has also invaded her liver which has two smaller ones. She has 5 treatments down, weekend off, then the last 5. By the way, that bastard measures 3.98x2.4x1.46 **inches**!

A typical female liver averages 8.5‚Äù long, hers is 13.5‚Äù? Is the extra 5‚Äù good or bad? Can the doctors do a resection of the tumor and leave her enough to live? I read somewhere that the liver will regrow.

I understand why she should be extremely tired, cranky and just bitchy all around. Then factor in her PTSD and her lack of being able to show (just me) any love, sympathy, empathy, anything that shows even a marginal of care for me.

Okay, here comes a shit load of numbers,(for no real benefit). I like numbers because they don‚Äôt lie. Math is math. For the duration of my time on this planet, 62 years, 4 months, 3 weeks and 4 days, (22,794 days), I have been married for 36 years, 2 months, 1 week and 6 days, (13,223 days). Today, October 18, 2024 has without question been the worst day of my life. I know that what she is saying to me is not her. But she was extremely vicious and dug deep to just crush me.

I was completely devastated. My heart, soul and just being were shredded, I told her I was going to bed while trying to hold back my emotions. When I got to my room I just had to let it out for about 5 hours. I had so many tears just streaming down my face I thought I was going to dehydrate.

Never felt that, ever. I was heavily physically and mentally abused when I was young, and nothing my mother ever did to me made me feel as I felt last night. This woman was cruel, evil, soulless, an alcoholic and was born without a purpose in life

Now, for the rest of the story‚Ä¶

My wife was a Para Teachers Assistant, (we used to call it special ed). She loved her job and was damn good at it. She worked for one of the local high schools, and the vast majority of these kids are never going to function in society. So many of them had no verbal skills, arrived by a special van with a nurse and could not even sit up or even move. I think the parents looked at it like state sponsored day care and just wanted a break from it all. The schools looked at it like a lot more money for trying to ‚Äúteach‚Äù these kids. Which in my opinion was futile, it really was all about the money.

Due to HIPPA laws she was not allowed to know anything about the kids. What exactly was their deficiency, their trigger points and their history? In September of 2020 she got the living shit beat out of her by one of these students. He was 6 feet tall and weighed about 200 pounds. He blew up in the classroom, threw one pregnant teacher across the room into the lockers, took a full grown man to the ground and then came at my wife. She did as trained and tried to talk him down until his handler could get there. He grabbed her and took her to the floor and the whole time was trying to bite her face, neck, whatever he could grab onto.

His handler shows up and gets him off of her and out of the classroom with my wifes help. She tells my wife that she is going to take off running and he will chase her. At that point my wife was to let go of him. When she did this he did not take off running but immediately turned on my wife and went back to try to bite her. My wife's fight or flight instinct did not have the time necessary to reset from the earlier attack. She has a hard time remembering how things happened, but she knows that she ended up on the floor again, and just trying to keep his mouth away from her body. He managed to bite her arm plenty deep enough to draw blood and she thinks she got kicked in the ribs at least a time or two before help came and got this kid off of her. Needless to say she was pretty shaken up and asked if she could go home. They let her do this and instructed her on where to go for medical treatment.

She arrived at home about 10:30 - 11:00 in the morning just hysterical, saying over and over ‚ÄúI got bit‚Äù.¬† I took her to the facility that the school said she had to go to and they treated her wound and rapped her ribs. They commented on how deep the wound from the bite was.

My wife tried to return to work the next day but after about an hour she had to leave. She did find out that she was the 22nd teacher that this student had assaulted. I think that that is information that should have been shared with anyone that was going to have interaction with him.

It has been over 4 years since the attack. She sees a therapist weekly and is making progress, slowly. For the longest time she could not be anywhere but home when it got dark. She can go to maybe half a dozen stores, all of which have a low concentration of people. She no longer cooks. I think there have been two meals she made since the beating.

I had an episode where for 5 nights in a row I was doing really weird stuff. Like waking her up in the middle of the night with my coat and shoes on asking her if she is ready to go? She of course wasn‚Äôt going anywhere but I swear she told me to take her somewhere, this happened twice. One night I had a quasi dream that I had to beat two other people to the kitchen because I wanted the bread and butter. I woke up in the kitchen alone. Another time I woke up flailing my arms falling backwards. I managed to pull the curtains down and woke up on the floor with the curtain rod across my face and the curtains sprawled about. The last time I woke up in extreme pain and falling backwards. I landed on a couple of computer monitors and a kerosene heater, in my closet. I figured out that in my sleep I slammed my face into the chest of drawers that were in there, broke my nose and woke up falling.

I went out and bought one of those sliding bolt locks for the bedroom door. I told my wife that after I go to bed to lock the door to the bedroom so I can‚Äôt get out of it because who knows what I might do. She refused to let this happen.

The next day I asked her to take me to the ER because I knew I couldn‚Äôt drive and she said she couldn‚Äôt. 3 - 4 hours later I came to her again and begged her to take me to the ER. I said I understand that she can‚Äôt come into the hospital with me, that she would if she could, but with how severe her PTSD is she would not be able to handle it. She could just drop me off and I would call her when I was done. So that is what we did. I ended up getting admitted, my blood oxygen level was 64% and the doctors and nurses were quite concerned. I knew I had COPD and it had progressed to this point rapidly. I now have supplemental oxygen 24/7 and for the most part I am doing ok about 80% of the time. The other 20% I feel like I am going to die because I just can‚Äôt catch my breath.

That is pretty much the back story, the following is what I go through daily. Let‚Äôs start with what I am either not allowed to say or do, and what she has said to me about how she feels:

* Not allowed to lay on couch
* Not allowed to say that I am tired
* Not allowed to say I had a rough night sleeping
* Not allowed to ask how her therapist meeting went. This I understand, she says it would be like asking her how her gynecologist exam went.
* I am not allowed to make telephone calls while in the same room as her
* I am not allowed to listen to music in the car or on the patio with her
* I am not allowed in any part of the house except my bedroom at times. She has taken up camp in the living room, sleeping in an oversized recliner.
* I am not allowed to comment on the amount of coffee she drinks, (12 - 15 cups a day) she says it doesn‚Äôt affect her. But most nights she gets 2 maybe 3 hours of sleep.
* If I try to talk to her while she is listening to a trial on Youtube with her earbuds in, I get a real disgusted ‚Äúwhat‚Äù from her.
* Anything important she can‚Äôt talk about right now.
* I am accused so many times of being a stressor to her
* She has told me that she can‚Äôt feel empathy for me right now, or love.
* She rarely shows me a sign of gratitude but will quickly point out something I did that stressed her or something that I didn't do and should have.
* She doesn‚Äôt care that her choice of isolation has also dictated a life of isolation for me.
* I figured out that I spend 22 hours a day on average in my room, she doesn't care.
* Today it dawned on me that I don‚Äôt care if she gets pissed off at me, but every time she has to slip in a good helping heap of fuckin guilt.¬†

There are so many more things, I used to have to text her when I was coming into the living room. This gives you a pretty good outline at least. I made a list just to help me remember the when, why, where I was supposed to do this, that or the other thing?

On my birthday I finally got the nerve up to cut a big skin tag off my ball sack. It was about as big as the end of your pinky finger and was on a nerve and sent a jolt through me anytime it rubbed against my boxers and I had to be real careful getting it out and putting it away when I went to the bathroom. I made sure to rub everything down with alcohol, even the scissors I used. Took a deep breath and told myself I just need 3 seconds of immense courage and snipped it off. I had no idea how much it would bleed. Three hours later I am still bleeding like I have never bled before. She got pissy because we had planned on meeting up with about 8 other family members for dinner. I told her I needed to go to the emergency room and get a couple of stitches. She got mad because I did this when I knew we were supposed to go to dinner with family members. She said once again that she couldn‚Äôt go and had our oldest daughter take me. I ended up with 7 stitches and a special clotting material affixed to it. She said that she would call the other people, two phone calls, and tell them that I was having a lung issue and was going to the ER. She told everybody exactly what happened, even though she knows that I don‚Äôt share personal information like that.

Now here we are 4 days later and her father is in the same hospital because he is having a hard time catching his breath and one of his legs is giving him problems. She is planning on going there early in the morning to see him. Do you see the irony here? Had absolutely no compassion for me, for a situation that I think was a bit more serious and she couldn‚Äôt go to the hospital with me, I thought due to her PTSD, but somebody else and she‚Äôs gotta be there.

Of course there is no closeness between us. I will rub her back and neck, tell her she looks nice, smells good when she wears my favorite perfume, I go to all of her doctor appointments with her, except her therapist, I went once. Yet, I get nothing in return except negative remarks. I get no physical contact from her which I need so badly. Just to have that human touch.

I have no one I can talk to about anything. We have been together for 38 years, married for 36. I have zero friends and always put her before me. The highlight of any day is going to Wal-Mart and getting HER car washed.

I handle all the bills now and if I see something strange in the online ledger I‚Äôve learned that I am not supposed to ask her about it. She would get fixated with these online games and buy upgrade packages or some shit like that. She would spend $400 to as much as $600 a month on this, and that was money we just didn‚Äôt have with her no longer working. But, I can't talk to her about it. It‚Äôs always the same, I am stressing her out.



**I am the stresser.**

Last time, pitted dates were out of stock so I bought dried cranberries (no fresh or frozen available) instead and read about this recipe on Martha Stewart's ebook I have. It balances the flavors of orange and cranberries. They are perfect for tea and coffee and smells delicious too, the crunchiness of walnuts in there also adds crunch and depth. This tea cake is tender and moist, a very perfect partner to tea or coffee. I used my small pan here around 4x2inch, but you can make it by 9x5 loaf. I also reduced the sugar because I soaked my dried cranberries in orange juice beforehand and thought that it will be too sweet if I put 1 cup.",5,1729570584.0,DessertPorn,0,1.0,False

1g99nrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1g99nrp/how_to_know_when_they_are_too_different/,How to know when they are TOO different ,"Hi all. I‚Äôm 20F and my partner is 20M. We have been together since May. 

The relationship has been going very well so far. We get along great, we get along with each other‚Äôs family well, we‚Äôve been on a few trips together, we‚Äôve had ups and downs that we‚Äôve navigated and communicated through. Overall we make each other very happy.

I date with the intention of it lasting. I enjoy overcoming differences and growing together. It‚Äôs fulfilling to see how much progress we have made in the past few months, how much better we know each other now.

With this deeper knowledge of each other, I‚Äôve come to realise we have some quite fundamental differences, and I‚Äôm not 100% sure I know if they‚Äôre dealbreakers just yet.

The biggest difference is how we keep our living spaces. He is very messy, can be very unhygienic, careless (things always seem to get broken) and he is generally unproductive at home.

We did a 3 week trip together staying at an Airbnb house and this became really obvious. Prior to the trip, we discussed that there will be chores that have to be split evenly. For example, doing the laundry, cooking meals, vacuuming, cleaning bathrooms, washing dishes etc.

Not only did he not hold up his end of the deal by sitting on the couch playing games a lot of the time, but he actively contributed to more mess.

He put uncovered food in the fridge (including raw meat), left spillages and mess on the countertops, left dirty work gear strewn all over the bed, the floor etc, left stains on the Airbnb couch from wiping his dirty fingers after eating, broke 3 utensils and 2 cups belonging to the Airbnb due to being careless (either mixing something way too aggressively and having the handle snap or shadow boxing the air and knocking over a full cup of coffee), leaving pee all over the toilet seat and floor‚Ä¶and so much more to be honest.

I was genuinely very stressed out the entire trip because the Airbnb was booked under my name and every time I brought things up like ‚Äúcan we be a bit more careful with their stuff‚Äù or ‚Äúcan we try and keep this place a bit tidier‚Äù he would respond saying he hasn‚Äôt been brought up in a ‚Äúcleanliness focused household‚Äù. 

After many instances of me trying to have a conversation with him about keeping things a bit tidier, I started feeling like I was his mother or something. Always nagging him to clean something up. The worst part is, when I would ask him to do something reasonable like ‚Äúcan you please just wipe up that kitchen bench from when you made food earlier‚Äù he would start huffing and puffing and complaining. Something as simple as wiping the counter would prove too difficult for him to even do properly, and I‚Äôd just end up having to do it myself. 

He would go to sleep around 10 each night and I would stay up cleaning the house so it wasn‚Äôt a complete mess every single day. There was ALWAYS a mess in the kitchen because he didn‚Äôt clean up after himself and I get genuinely grossed out by the thought of leaving food on the counters and open meat in the fridge all night and waking up to it being stinky in the morning. I just took on that responsibility otherwise it wouldn‚Äôt be done.
 
Also I just want to clarify that we both work full time. We both split the costs of this trip 50/50. We split all expenses 50/50. 

It made me start resenting him. Although we got along very well, this repeated (what i felt was) weaponised incompetence was becoming incredibly annoying. It made my attraction for him weaken and I didn‚Äôt find myself wanting to be intimate because I had just spent the past day either asking him repeatedly to do simple and obvious cleaning tasks, or spending hours doing it alone, only for it to get messy again the next day.

I would feel guilty for not wanting to be intimate every day so I would just suck it up and do it anyway because otherwise he would start getting upset and saying he felt unloved. 

He is a very kind hearted person and he‚Äôs hard working and loyal. My whole family really like him, and I do too. I just need to know whether I‚Äôm being dramatic, and this is a non-issue that can be improved. 

Part of me really understands that how you‚Äôre raised impacts you significantly as you grow up, and old habits can die hard.
I don‚Äôt want to make him feel bad about himself.
I just want to be heard about this specific thing, as it‚Äôs really the only sore spot in our relationship. I hate carrying the burden of ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù in the household. I don‚Äôt work or earn any less than him. I just feel like I‚Äôm contributing so much more though and that‚Äôs hard to communicate without sounding offensive.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",2,1729570512.0,dating,6,1.0,False
