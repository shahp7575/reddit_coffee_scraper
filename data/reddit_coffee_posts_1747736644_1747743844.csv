1kr3gyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1kr3gyp/my_story_begins_with_you/,My Story Begins With You,"You say I am the story.
But if that’s true, then you were the author, my love.
All of my stories begin and end with you.

And one day, when they ask how we met—
when they ask when we knew—
when you don’t have the perfect words to tell them the story
of how we found each other,
how we broke and burned and rebuilt ourselves—
how, together, we overcame—

I’ll be there to remind you:
We never needed perfect.
We only needed each other.
And together is how our story will be told.
Together is how it was always meant to be heard.

Because together, you and I have the moments.
We have the words.
We have the lifetimes.
And best of all?

We have each other.

Before you, I had nothing.
After you, I had everything.
My story begins with you.

Do you remember the first thing I ever said to you?
How young and foolish I was back then…

(Don’t you dare tell them I’ve hardly changed.)

I barged in like a storm.
No hello. No softness. Just “Who are you?”
And still—you stayed.
Still—you saw me.

Even then…
I think some part of me already belonged to you.

Even before we shared the first glance,
there was something different about the way you made me feel.
And it’s a feeling I could never forget.
Because even now—after all this time—
you still make me feel it.

The first time I saw you only confirmed what we both already knew.
Something ancient.
Something written long before we had names to call each other.

A knowing that settled deep into my bones
the moment your eyes found mine.

I didn’t just recognize you.
I remembered you.

Even then, I think we understood:
This wasn’t a meeting.
It was a return.
Two souls, finally circling back
after lifetimes of echoing footsteps and almosts.

And my love...
you didn’t complete me.
You didn’t fix or rescue or remake me.
You reminded me.

Reminded me of who I was
when I wasn’t afraid to be seen.
When I wasn’t pretending I needed less than everything.

And you gave it to me—everything.
Not all at once,
but piece by piece.
Morning by morning.
Ritual by ritual.
Softness by sacred softness.

I never needed you to prove you were whole—
because I wasn’t either.
Not until you.

I think about that time you rolled over,
head propped on your elbow,
asking me questions you already knew the answers to...
and I couldn’t help but smile.

When I pulled you closer,
buried my face in the crook of your neck,
your arms tightened around me.
Do you remember how I left a trail of kisses along your neck,
all the way to your ear?

How when I whispered,
""Told you so, didn’t I?""
—your whole body reacted—
and in the best way?

I giggled wildly as we became a tangle of limbs and sheets.
I lived for those nights when you’d find me under our covers,
and I’d get lost in you.

I remember the first time I “serenaded” you—
how your eyebrows shot straight up,
and your face said “This woman is insane”
but oh, how we laughed.

Your laugh…
God, your laugh was magic.
And when I heard it,
my eyes filled with tears
because I knew—
I would do anything to hear that sound again.

You noticed.
Of course you did.

You crossed the distance in record time,
concern etched across your face,
your hands brushing away the tears.

You never ran from them.
Never flinched at my feelings.
You embraced them.
You embraced me.

After a lifetime of people backing away from how deeply I felt—
you stayed.
You loved me harder for it.

The small things—
our little day-to-day rituals—
they were my lifeline.

The silent conversations when our eyes would meet,
saying everything we couldn’t say out loud in those moments.
The busy mornings, quick kisses,
coffee mugs passed like batons in a track race.
The turning back for “just one more” kiss—
lips pressed to lips, whispering,
“I love you.”

It was everything.
You were everything.

And you were mine.
Always mine.

And now that we’re old—
now that time has marked our skin with the evidence of our journey,
looming overhead and reminding us our time is finite—

When that day comes…
I will have to go first.
Because there is no version of me that matters without you.
Because my story began with you.
And you are how my story ends.

1kr3ggl,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1kr3ggl/i_moved_to_a_new_city_alone/,I moved to a new city alone,"So I took the decision back in November and moved to Alberta without knowing a single soul here. 

First couple months were honestly very hard. Rent was pretty high but I was fortunate enough to have some savings which I used for the deposit and 6 months of rent. I'd come home from work and just sit in this empty apartment wondering if I'd made a massive mistake. I had nobody to talk to like literally nobody.  The turning point came when I stopped trying so hard. Started just doing things I actually enjoy doing like walking around, working from different coffee shops and taking myself to dinner. I eventually started having actual conversations with people.  
Made my first real friend when I overheard someone at the gym talking about a podcast which I'm also listening to. Now we go to the gym regularly and I've met their friend group.  
Still have plenty of lonely moments. Still question my decision sometimes.  I guess what I'm saying is that it's a process. Some days I feel like I'm crushing this independent adult thing and other days I still facetime my mom crying because I miss home.

It's funny how you can just sit there and let the world pass by, right? Well, as I sat there, sipping on my coffee, a thought struck me. 

I was watching this little kid chase after his runaway balloon when this older man, who I'd seen every other morning jogging past, caught it and handed it back with a big smile. The kid's mom looked relieved, and there was this brief, silent exchange that was so... I dunno, heartfelt? It got me thinking about how intertwined our actions are, even in tiny ways. 

Every action we take, even if it's just holding a door open or giving a smile, kinda loops into this bigger web of human connection that we're all part of. It's like, we affect each other all the time, even if we're not totally aware of it. 

Idk if I'm making sense, but it sorta made me appreciate those little interactions more. It’s like realizing every small ripple has a part in the larger story around us. Tbh, it made my coffee taste a tiny bit better afterwards. 😊",2,1747743389.0,NormaldayEpiphanies,0,1.0,False

I 23M, and my partner 21F have been in a relationship for a few years. She's expected to start working in Manchester this July thanks to her hard work and dedication. This is a huge achievement, and I'm incredibly proud of her—it's something we've both been working towards for a long time.

However, she's from a poor country, and the opportunity to work in Manchester is highly competitive—especially among her more experienced colleagues. So when she earned this position after only a few months, it created a lot of resentment. As a result, she's made several enemies.

Three departments have been bullying her, and their actions have become increasingly dangerous. They've spiked her drink, stolen her wallet multiple times, spilled hot coffee on her, broken into her hotel room, and most recently, damaged a valuable item and blamed her for it. As the deadline gets closer, their behavior is becoming more extreme. I’m really worried, but she’s strong, and she’s determined not to let this stop her from taking the job in Manchester and starting our life together.

They broke the jar (the valuable item) and then had the CCTV footage removed thanks to their connections. This is serious—if she didn’t pay for the damage immediately, the company could have taken legal action, which might have jeopardized her main job offer. That’s what they want. We paid it off, but I had to use a significant portion of my credit card. Ofc they pushed to take legal action but we managed to sort it.

Rent in the city is too expensive, but fortunately, her company allowed her to work from home, although she still needs to go in at least two weeks a month.

I've been helping her out financially since Christmas, but lately, I’ve been sending even more, and it’s starting to take a toll on me. I don’t need the money as urgently since I live with my parents, but she could end up homeless or without food, so I’m doing what I can.

I’m just not sure what to do. We’re so close—just a month and a half away from starting our life together properly. My current plan is to keep using my credit card, as long as I can pay it off before interest hits. In July or May, we should both be able to pay it down together as she will start her job, good pay, and I will have a lot leftover since Im not supporting her.

And yes, I trust her. We FaceTime constantly, send lots of videos, and we've both done plenty to prove our loyalty and commitment to each other.

I wonder what could have happen if I say yes to try again,"I met my ex during college. Our first date was a spontaneous backpacking trip to another country—fun, random, and adventurous. I’d never done anything like that with anyone else, and maybe that’s why she still crosses my mind from time to time.

We broke up in my final year. I was 23M, she was 22F. It was her decision, but I take responsibility too. I guess I wasn’t mature enough to make good life decisions back then. I tried to win her back, but something she said hit me so hard that I stopped trying. A few months later, she reached out, but I cut off contact—I was still heartbroken. This all happened while we were still in college.

After graduation, I moved to another country for work—partly to avoid running into her or our mutual friends. She reached out a few times, asking to meet for coffee. I could’ve taken a short flight home, but I always declined, saying I wasn’t in the country. Since then, I’ve been traveling solo for work and leisure, trying to create new memories alone and move on from the ones we shared. I deleted every picture and removed everything that reminded of her.

Four years after graduation, I met someone new. We got married and settled down in a country halfway across the world. I texted my ex to let her know I was getting married and that it was time for us to go our separate ways and 'be strangers'. She was okay with it.

I don’t think about her much anymore. Didn't talk to her at all. But sometimes, she appears in my dreams—sometimes we’re just talking, sometimes it’s more intimate. I haven’t spoken to her in five years, and the last time we met was nine years ago. Because of the dream, I tried to look up her name online, I learned that she is still single as of 2024. Thats all I know

My relationship with my wife and kids is strong. Everything is fine. I would never cheat. Still, every now and then, I wonder: what if I had agreed to that coffee? What if we had tried again?",1,1747743143.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

**New Black Edition Ready-to-drink flavours + Introduction of Selection Box in Germany!** 

Back in October, we mentioned that we’d be introducing the new flavours to you, and you have been patiently waiting for them. I’m happy to tell you that we are launching both our Caffè Latte and Strawberry & Banana – they’ll be joining the line-up for our German Hueligans! Just to clarify Caffè Latte is the German equivalent of UK’s Iced Latte and USA’s Iced Coffee. 

**Strawberry & Banana**

This is a fresh, fruity take on your favourite homemade smoothie. Think zingy strawberry, creamy banana and wholesome, yoghurt-inspired flavours, rounded off with a mellow sweetness.

**Caffè Latte**

Bold coffee meets just the right touch of sweetness and a smooth, creamy latte finish. With 95mg of caffeine, it delivers a proper pick-me-up and full-on flavour.

**Both are still loaded with 35g of protein, 26 essential vitamins and minerals and 171 health benefits.**

Can’t make up your mind? We have a selection box ready and waiting for you, offering three of each flavour for you to enjoy!

I am not turkish and do not speak Turkish. I do not have a job either. During the week days when my boyfriend is at work, I am bored and alone. I have work to do on my computer, so I would be open to join students studying, or joining a group, or going shopping, or going for coffee. 
I do not have a car. I do not know how to use the bus but willing to learn. 

Any advice for me? Anyone interested in being my friend?

You say AA isn’t your scene, that it cramps your style. Boo-fucking-hoo. Sobriety isn't your trendy detox spa, cupcake. It's grimy, it's ruthless, and it's served ice-cold with a shot of straight-up reality to choke on.

You think you’re hot shit going solo? Wrong again, motherfucker. You're dancing barefoot through broken glass, about two steps away from sucking pavement in a piss-stained alley. AA ain’t here to hold your fucking hand—it’s here to shove your face in the dirt and ask if you’ve had enough. You need a sponsor tougher than boot leather, meaner than a Rottweiler on PCP, someone who’s seen hell and made Lucifer cry for mama. A sponsor who'll gut your bullshit excuses, smack your ego into next week, and push your sorry ass toward accountability.

And yeah, there’s a God in this mess—a Biblical God, pissed-off, vengeful, and fed up with your sorry excuses. Forget the enlightened guru crap and new-age kumbaya bullshit. This is Old Testament fury—fire, brimstone, and zero fucks given. You don’t have to love it, but you better goddamn well fear and respect it. This God's your last lifeline, your merciless fixer, the ruthless bastard who'll drag your sorry carcass out of the gutter when everyone else is pissing on your grave.

AA is a twelve-round slugfest, a bloody, sweaty crawl through relentless self-dissection. Forget warm fuzzies and therapist couches—this is brutal honesty served raw and nasty. Grab a shaky hand around that shitty coffee, choke down your stale-ass donut, and swallow your fucking pride.

So here's the cold, hard truth, you anti-AA assholes: Either suck it up, get with the fucking program, find a sponsor meaner than your fucked-up inner demons, and square your sorry ass with a Biblical hard-ass—or keep bullshitting yourself until the gutter reclaims you. Your move, champ. Don't ever say you weren't warned.

1kr35gr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1kr35gr/my_story_27m_about_my_undiagnosed_bpd_ex_23f_and/,"My Story (27M) About my undiagnosed BPD Ex (23F), and how I am trying to get out.","Every relationship seems to start the same way: amazing, magical, full of promise. That’s how it began with her too. When I saw her first it struck me in my core, I became really anxious around her and never really had this before. I thought it was love at first sight (it was probably all my alarm bells going off, and I confused it with love).

But early on, something felt off. She just came out off a toxic on and off again relationship, so I had somewhat of doubts. So I tested the waters with a small boundary. It felt like she was wearing a mask. Everything seemed too perfect. I had been single for a few years and felt confident in myself, so I trusted my gut.

That boundary led to an emotional storm. She cried, used other people’s opinions to pressure me, called me ten times, and insisted I was the one in the wrong. She tried to manipulate me into giving in. I didn’t.

I stayed calm and told her that I simply saw things differently. I said that was okay. That alone made her react as if I had deeply threatened her. Her eyes widened, and it seemed to break something inside her.

That turned into hours of back-and-forth, while I just repeated my perspective and stuck to it.

Later, something similar happened when she went on holiday with her parents. She called me during a quick stop. For me, it was early morning. I picked up and told her I was happy for her, but also really tired. I said I’d rather talk later.

Her tone changed. Her eyes went cold. She said “okay” but hung up in a tense way.

Not long after, she started calling me repeatedly. Then came a flood of angry messages.

Later that day, when she arrived at the hotel, she insisted we speak. I agreed. I wasn’t upset, just exhausted. But the conversation quickly turned aggressive. She said I was wrong for not wanting to talk to her. I explained again that we talk all the time and I was just tired. That’s it.

She didn’t accept it. She accused me of neglecting her. She became increasingly demanding. Eventually, I snapped. I said something like, “You have a princess syndrome.”

I knew that was wrong. I always take responsibility when I say something hurtful. But I had reached my limit. Everyone has one.

She fell silent for a few seconds, then said: “It’s over. We’re done.”

I was stunned. How did we get here? But I stayed composed, took a deep breath, and said “Okay.” Then I ended the call.

Two days later, she messaged me again. Sweet words about her trip. She missed me. She wanted to call. When we spoke, she acted like nothing had happened. Bright, happy, like her old self. I thought, maybe things could still work.

I apologized for my earlier comment. She said she understood. Apparently her father had told her she overreacted.

Things seemed to return to normal.

But deep down, I still had this feeling. Something wasn’t right. Yet I stayed. The highs were incredible. The sex, the attention, the energy. She made me feel so alive. But I couldn’t ignore that lingering doubt.

I told myself it was just a rough patch.

Then came a major incident. About five months in, while I was driving her home, she picked a fight. She said everything wrong in our relationship was my fault and that I needed to accept that. I told her I disagreed. To me, it was 50/50 and we have certain ways we trigger eachother, and should find a better way to deal with things.

She didn’t like that. She became cold again. She started pinching me while I was driving.

I stayed calm and said I saw things differently. I told her to have a good evening and enjoy her party. We kissed goodbye.

That night, at around 5 a.m., she called me crying. She said she had done too much coke and kissed her ex. Or maybe he kissed her, she wasn’t clear. She said she regretted it. I told her we would talk the next day and went back to sleep.

When I messaged her the next morning, asking what had happened, she acted like it wasn’t a big deal. She didn’t want to talk. She had a festival coming up.

I was furious. I felt completely betrayed. She had sent me a heartbreaking message in the middle of the night and then didn’t want to explain it. I told myself to let her go and focused on spending time with friends.

I realized I was too hurt. I would never be able to forgive her.

The next day, she contacted me again. I didn’t respond at first, but she kept calling. Sending messages where I was. I slept at a friends place and went home that morning, 30 minutes later my doorbell rings. I saw her standing there, opened the door, she was immediately sexual. And for some reason, I gave in. The sex was amazing. It always was.

She told me nothing much had happened. The guy had tried to kiss her but she didn’t really kiss back. I later checked with people who were at the party. They confirmed her version.

So was she just trying to hurt me? Or was this a punishment for not taking the blame? I didn’t know.

I pushed it all down.

After that, things really fell apart. I became more short-tempered. My boundaries weakened. We started arguing every week.

Then one day, after a calm night where we had sex and everything seemed fine, she suddenly broke up with me. It felt betrayed. She told me to sit down and said she was ending it.

I packed my stuff and left. I blocked her.

That should have been the end.

I had a full breakdown. I felt like a part of me had been ripped away. I was completely shattered.

But I didn’t reach out.

She went on holiday shortly after. It was my birthday. I didn’t hear from her. That broke me again. So I sent her a short message, wishing her a nice trip.

She called me. She cried. Said she missed me. I fell for it.

That same night, she texted me again. This time: “We’re done. Don’t contact me again.” Then she blocked me. I felt sick again lol.

Two days later, she unblocked me. Messaged me sweet things. Wanted to talk again.

I asked her, out of curiosity, if anything had happened while she was away. She said she had kissed someone. But something in her voice told me she was lying.

So I asked again. Please be honest.

She admitted she had slept with a guy she met on the bus. On the very same day I had reached out. And not just once — the whole week.

I was in shock. How could someone go from such an intense relationship to sleeping with a stranger within days?

I was disgusted. Hurt beyond words. She had even sent me photos and hoovered me sexually while banging someone else there.

She later said she regretted it. That it hadn’t meant anything.

I knew that if I gave her another chance, I’d lose all my self-respect. But I was addicted. I gave in. I couldn’t trust her anymore. I was drained.

Eventually, I ended it. I dropped off her stuff and decided I wouldn’t let myself be the victim anymore.

And for a while, it worked. I felt free. I enjoyed life again.

But about a month later, she reached out again. Said she missed me. Wanted to talk, that she understands me. I kept it short and kept my distance.

Later that night she texted me she was super horney and wanted sex. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn’t resist the damn sex.

Afterward, she told me she had slept with another ex during the time we were apart (the one she monkeybranched from to me). It didn’t feel good with him, so she came back to me.

It didn’t bother me much. And I convinced myself I didn’t care.

We started again, but this time it was pure toxicity. Weekly fights. She physically attacked me. Tried to kick me. Threw my belongings. Then cried and begged me to stay.

When we argued, I wasn’t even allowed to leave the room. She would follow me, get in my face, and pinch me. I started to lose my mind.

Two things would always happen. Either the fight would last for hours, or she would suddenly soften, cry, and say she was sorry.

Once, we smoked weed together. She wanted sex, but I had a bad trip and couldn’t perform. She accused me of not finding her attractive. She became really insecure. Said I watched too much porn, which I didn’t. The conversation spiraled.

I tried to leave, but she exploded. She ran after me, screamed, threw things, then cried and begged again.

I tried to explain that her behavior was the reason her relationships were failing. I broke down while explaining. It only made things worse. She recorded me while having a mental breakdown.

I stepped outside to smoke. She followed, grabbed my cigarette, and told me I wasn’t allowed to smoke.

I felt like I was losing my grip on reality.

We fought again. She made me feel like I’d destroy her if I left. So I stayed. I lay next to her in bed, feeling terrified.

She got sexual again. It was surreal. I dissociated. She said weird things like “you enjoy toxic sex,” while she was half-crying.

I didn’t know how to escape. I didn’t know how to get out anymore.

All my earlier attempts hadn’t worked.

I pulled myself back. I felt violated, sitting alone at home, and couldn’t bring up any motivation to talk to her. She kept trying, saying she wanted to continue the relationship. I kept her tagging along even though I knew it was wrong. But I couldn’t end it — I wanted her to do it.

She didn’t.

After three weeks of distance, I told her we should break up. I went to a party shortly after and hooked up with girls. I guess I wanted some kind of personal revenge. I’ve never done that before, but I let myself go completely and drank a lot.

I went to a girl’s room. She started going down on me, but I couldn’t get hard. I felt no excitement. I just wanted to escape, to feel like I could move on from her. But she still had a grip on me. I left the girl’s place and felt like total shit.

The next day — like a junkie — I contacted her again.

Told her what happened. Said I regretted it. Typical “blah blah.” I realized I made a huge mistake. The idea of me being with other girls triggered her instantly and she wanted to get back together.

During our stressful relationship, I noticed myself drinking more on weekends and joining her habit of smoking weed. She smoked daily to cope with her emotions.

I wasn’t allowed to smoke cigarettes — unless she was smoking, and then it was “fine.”

Weird double standards. We had huge fights about this too.

Eventually I gave in. I decided there was no way out. I lost my boundaries in the process and became an obedient loser walking on eggshells all the time. Constantly checking her mood. Sleeping with anxiety. Making coffee in the morning, tea in the evening, grabbing her snacks, endlessly cuddling, scratching her back — doing everything by her command, afraid to say no because I knew she’d lash out again.

Tired. Stressed. But I thought: The relationship finally works.

Things went well for three months. I convinced myself we’d finally found balance.

Mind you — I let my friends go in the process, because she disliked them. I let go of my hobbies, like kickboxing, because it took too much time and she wanted us to spend more time together. I became a shell of myself, without realizing it.

I stopped fighting when arguments came. I let it all slide.

Those three months were fun in a way. I managed to find a way to “deal” with it. Things seemed okay. She reintroduced me to her parents. We had a good time with them.

Everything felt like it was finally going in the right direction.

She started talking about kids, having a child together, thinking about moving in. I went along with it, but it all felt too fast and built on no solid foundation.

I still felt something was wrong. But I buried it deep, just to keep the relationship intact and enjoy the highs. The fun trips, the swimming pool, the intense stoned sex in the dressing rooms. In the car, everywhere. Everything was so exciting, and I told myself: This is the price I pay. Just give in. I don’t want to lose this.

But after the introduction to her parents, something in her changed. She became more demanding, more disrespectful — even though I had given everything I could.

I asked if we could leave 15 minutes earlier one day so I could go back to kickboxing. She flipped. It messed with her schedule, she got hostile, and it felt like we were right back at square one. (Keep in mind: we still had two hours left before we needed to leave.)

The thing I’d tried so hard to prevent for three months came back — because I asked for one small thing for myself.

She started crying again. Saying she hated her life. That everyone was stupid. That I wasn’t there for her. It felt like the same script all over again.

I told her I needed space and left.

Three hours later she texted that she was sorry — but I felt disgusted again.

I was burned out by the relationship. I work a full-time job. I slept at her place. Her alarm would go off at 6:00 AM, and half-asleep I’d say something like “pff, it’s early,” not even annoyed — just acknowledging it.

She flipped. Called me lazy. Told me if I didn’t agree with her, I should leave. That I was useless. That she had to get up early too. She told me I should get cancer. Or something like that. I was so tired. I couldn’t sleep properly anymore. I felt truly, deeply hurt. I had done everything I could to make it work.

And something snapped in me.

It was like a switch in my head said:

“She doesn’t love me. I’ll never be enough. I need to get out.”

That thought felt real. Like my intuition finally broke through.

I started crying in front of her. Told her she never loved me. That it was all fake. A dream. Acting. That I would never be enough. I broke down.

She gave me the silent treatment. I put on my clothes and told her I was leaving for work. She ran after me and slapped me again.

That was the hard line. I told her I would never accept that again.

I went home and felt absolutely violated.

What have I become?

I started consulting ChatGPT. Told it what happened. It told me to break it off clean, via text.

So I did. I sent the message. It felt extremely nerve-wracking, but I just went with it.

It suggested I block her on everything. I couldn’t. I gave her a day to come to her senses.

She didn’t.

She acted like she didn’t care that I broke up.

So I blocked her.

She kept calling me anonymously for weeks. Contacted my parents. Eventually, she came to my house. I let her in. She immediately grabbed my dick and tried to get sexual. I said no. Got angry about everything she had done and told her to leave.

Afterward, I felt regret. I called her, said I was sorry for lashing out. She started hovering again — wanted sex “one more time” before her holiday. Eventually, we did. But I felt totally detached.

She went on holiday. I went cold turkey: no contact.

Give or take two weeks later, and my mind started playing tricks on me again. I missed her. Why???

I contacted her again. She sent me nudes. Said she missed me. Missed the sex. Blah blah.

I resisted the urge. Told her I wasn’t thinking clearly and wished her a good holiday.

I’m currently in therapy, working through everything. But I got lured back in two more times.

The first time ended in a heavy fight. A week later, she hovered again — wanted to go to a hotel.

Then she discarded me completely. And honestly — I was somewhat happy I’m out. But still… the thoughts come. The addiction kicks in from time to time.

I don’t know what to do. I’m not even sure if this therapist is what I really need to get out of this mess.

I feel lost. I want to cry and let it go but something inside of me keeps pulling me back. I don’t know how to get out of this mess. I feel therapy isn’t helping me, I read the book, stop walking on eggshels, but it’s more about how to deal with such relationships, and not about how to move on from this trauma-bond.

I start to question myself, maybe I am in the wrong, maybe I should have done things differently.. it’s mind boggling. The relationship lasted about 1.5 years.

(Some added context):
What makes it weirder is, she has lots of girlfriends and large friend groups. Good at her work. Highly capable and smart. 
Her parents seem financially really stable and high functioning.

She always complained about her friends to mee though and what she finds annoying from all of them.

Her aunt is diagnosed with BPD, and I think her father has it also. But the high functioning one.

She told me when she was little her father was really, strict. Lots of rules. And she got by him sometimes also.",1,1747742636.0,BPDlovedones,1,1.0,False

1kr32jp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kr32jp/the_girl_on_the_bus/,The girl on the bus,"It had been a long, draining day at work, the kind that leaves you numb and detached, your body moving through the motions while your mind lingers elsewhere. The bus ride home was humid from too many passengers in too many layers, the scent of damp wool and tired bodies thick in the air. I had taken my usual seat near the back, pressed my head against the cool window, and let the vibration of the engine lull me into that hazy space between wakefulness and sleep, where thoughts slip away into the quiet hum of exhaustion.

It was only after a few stops, when the crowd had thinned enough for my peripheral vision to widen, that I noticed her sitting a few rows ahead of me, just slightly to the right, positioned in a way that should have made her invisible to my tired, unfocused gaze. But she wasn’t invisible—not at all. She was staring at me. Not in that absent, unfocused way people sometimes do when they’re lost in thought, their eyes unknowingly fixed on something in front of them, but in a way that felt deliberate and unsettlingly focused. Her face was partially obscured by the seat in front of her, her dark eyes peering through the gap, unblinking, unwavering, as if she had been watching me for some time, waiting for me to notice.

A slow discomfort crawled under my skin, but I told myself I was being paranoid, that I was imagining it, that she wasn’t actually looking at me but past me, or maybe she was just zoning out. Even so, I turned my gaze to the window, forcing myself to focus on the outside world—the blur of neon reflections in puddles, the flickering streetlights, the occasional car slicing through the rain-slicked roads—anything but the weight of that stare. But I could still feel it, prickling at the back of my mind like an itch I couldn’t scratch. After a few long minutes, my resolve faltered, and I stole another glance.

She hadn’t moved.

The same position, the same tilt of the head, the same sharp, studying gaze that felt too knowing, too intent, like she was committing something to memory. My stomach twisted in a way I couldn’t explain, a deep, instinctual discomfort that made my skin prickle. When the bus slowed for my stop, I pushed the button almost too eagerly, relieved to have a reason to get up, to put distance between myself and whatever strange, silent game she was playing. As I walked past her row toward the exit, I forced myself not to look at her, not to acknowledge her presence at all, but out of the corner of my eye, I saw the faintest shift—her head turning ever so slightly to follow my movement.

The moment my feet hit the pavement, a wave of relief washed over me, but it didn’t last long. The rain had picked up, falling in thin, cold sheets that blurred the distant streetlights, and as I walked the familiar path home, my mind kept returning to her, to the way she had stared, to the strange, unsettling feeling she had left in her wake. It was ridiculous, I told myself. Just a weird woman, nothing more. Maybe she had some disorder that made her unaware of how unsettling she came across. Maybe she was just socially awkward. Maybe—probably—there was a completely rational explanation. But even as I let myself into my house, locked the door, and let the quiet warmth of home settle around me, I couldn’t shake the image of her face, couldn’t push away the feeling that something about that encounter had been more than just a harmless oddity.

The next evening, as I stepped onto the bus, I found myself scanning the seats before I even realized what I was doing. The irrational part of me expected to see her right away, sitting in the same place, staring at me again, but the rows were filled with ordinary passengers—tired office workers, students buried in their phones, an elderly man folding up a newspaper—and I let out a quiet breath of relief as I took my usual seat. The exhaustion from another long workday weighed on me heavily, and before I knew it, the bus’s familiar motion had lulled me into a drowsy haze.

I must have dozed off, because the next thing I knew, my head snapped forward, jolted by the sharp impact of a pothole. My vision was momentarily blurred, my thoughts sluggish as I tried to reorient myself, but then my breath caught, my stomach lurching as cold dread spread through my limbs like ice.

She was there.

Closer.

Not four seats ahead this time. Two.

I couldn’t move. My entire body had gone rigid, my breath locked in my throat, my pulse hammering against my ribs. She was leaning slightly over the back of the seat in front of her, her head tilted at that same unnatural angle, her eyes locked onto mine with that same unblinking, predatory intensity. And then, before I could even process what was happening, her lips curled upward into a smile.

It was slow, deliberate, stretching across her face with an unnatural ease, a smile that didn’t belong, a smile that wasn’t meant to comfort or reassure or express happiness. It was the kind of smile someone gives when they know something you don’t, when they have the upper hand, when they’re waiting for the game to begin.

I felt sick. Every fiber of my being screamed at me to move, to break the spell of whatever this was, to put as much distance between us as possible, and before I could second-guess myself, I shot up from my seat and walked straight to the front of the bus. I didn’t care how it looked. I didn’t care if anyone noticed. I just needed to be somewhere else.

The minutes stretched unbearably long as I sat near the driver, staring straight ahead, refusing to look back, counting the stops under my breath. When my stop finally arrived, I practically bolted off the bus, my hands shoved deep into my pockets, my shoulders tense as I walked quickly down the quiet streets, listening—*really* listening—for any hint of footsteps behind me.

There was nothing. No one. Just the occasional distant sound of a car, the gentle patter of rain against rooftops, the soft hum of the city breathing. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling of being followed, the creeping paranoia gnawing at my senses, making my skin crawl.

By the time I reached my house, I felt like I had been holding my breath for ten straight minutes. The relief of locking the door behind me was immediate. I let out a long breath, rolling my shoulders, trying to shake off the last remnants of tension that clung to my muscles like something tangible. The house was warm, the air thick with the familiar scent of old wood and fabric softener, a comforting contrast to the cold dampness outside. I hung up my coat, kicked off my shoes, and told myself—*That’s it. It’s over. Just some strange, unnerving woman on the bus. Nothing more.*

Still, my skin felt tight, stretched over my bones in that way it does when you’ve been on edge for too long. I needed something to ground me, to shake off the eerie unease that still lingered in my chest, so I made my way to the kitchen. I filled the kettle with water, the quiet hum of it heating up filled the silence in a way that was oddly soothing. I pulled some bread from the counter, slathered butter onto it absentmindedly, then added some ham and cheese—nothing fancy, just something to fill the empty space in my stomach. The kettle clicked off, and I poured the steaming water into a mug, the scent of chamomile curling up into the air like something familiar, something safe.

Taking my tea and sandwich, I settled onto the couch, flicking on the TV more for the background noise than anything else. The glow of the screen bathed the room in a soft, bluish hue as I was flickering between commercials and reruns of some late-night talk show.. I took a bite of my sandwich, sipped my tea, my body sinking into the cushions, but I wasn’t really watching the screen—I was thinking about *her.*

The way she had looked at me. The way she smiled*.*

Even now, the memory of it made my stomach turn, that eerie, unnatural grin stretching too wide across her face, as if she had *enjoyed* how unsettled I was. I shook my head, forcing myself to focus on the flickering images on the screen, but the feeling wouldn’t leave me. My eyes kept flickering toward the windows, the corners of the room, the darkened hallway leading to the stairs.

Eventually, I sighed, rubbing my hands over my face. *Enough. I’m not going to sit here all night thinking about some weirdo on public transport.*

I finished my tea, turned off the television, and stood. The moment the screen went dark, swallowing the last bit of artificial light in the room, something in the air shifted. The silence, which had been comforting just moments ago, suddenly felt *too loud,* pressing in from all sides, thick and heavy like a weighted blanket suffocating the house. My breath slowed, my body instinctively tensing, every muscle bracing for something unseen.

I stood there for a long moment, listening.

There was nothing.

No creak of the floorboards. No rustling fabric. No breath that wasn’t my own. And yet, something inside me whispered—*You’re not alone.*

I swallowed hard, the back of my neck prickling, and told myself I was being ridiculous, that my mind was playing tricks on me. Still, the unease coiled in my gut wouldn’t settle, and before I knew it, I was moving, my feet carrying me through the house, flicking on lights as I went.

I checked the downstairs bathroom. Empty. The coat closet. Nothing. The kitchen, the laundry room—both they were all just as I had left them.

I hesitated at the bottom of the stairs, staring up into the darkened second floor, the air feeling *heavier* up there, like something unseen was waiting just beyond the reach of the light. My heartbeat quickened, but I forced myself up, my steps slow and measured, the creaking of the old wooden stairs suddenly far too loud.

Bedroom. Empty.

Guest room. Empty.

Bathroom. Empty.

I even checked under the bed, in the wardrobe, in the hallway linen closet—*nothing.*

I exhaled, a dry laugh catching in my throat. *See? You’re losing it. No one is here. You’re safe.*

Feeling almost foolish, I shook my head and headed back downstairs, flipping off the lights one by one, my body finally starting to relax, the tension in my shoulders loosening. I was just overtired. That was all. My mind had latched onto the weirdness of the bus ride, and I had let it get to me.

I reached the bottom of the stairs, my feet automatically carrying me toward the front door, to double check the lock as I always do, the last thing on my mental checklist before finally going to bed.

And then, my blood ran cold.

The door wasn’t closed.

It was open.

Not wide, just a few inches, swaying slightly as if it had been nudged, the wet night air creeping in like an unwelcome breath. My stomach twisted violently as my mind reeled, scrambling for explanations, for *any* possible reason why the door—*which I knew I had locked*—was now standing open.

A sickening realization struck me like a hammer to the chest. If the door was open *now,* that meant whatever—or *whoever*—had opened it was already *inside.*

Every hair on my body stood on end. My breath hitched, and without thinking, I whirled around, my heart hammering so hard I thought I might pass out, my eyes scanning the dimly lit hallway for any sign of movement.

That’s when I saw it.

Not movement. Not a shadow. Not something lurking in the doorway or crouching behind the furniture.

My coat.

Hanging exactly where I had left it on the rack.

Except—

My shoes.

They weren’t empty.

Two feet. Two legs, going up into my coat.

Inside my coat, between the top button and the one below, I saw it—an eye, peeking through the space between the fabric, locked onto me with an intensity so sharp, so *hungry,* that my entire body seized up, my breath caught somewhere between a scream and a sob.

I stumbled backward, my vision tunneling, my limbs uncoordinated with the sheer weight of panic crashing over me, but as I turned to bolt for the door, I heard the shift of fabric, the almost imperceptible sound of *her* stepping forward.

That was all I needed.

Adrenaline surged through my veins, and suddenly I was *moving,* slamming the door open and throwing myself out into the cold night air, my feet hitting the pavement with reckless desperation. I ran without thinking, without direction, without anything but sheer instinct screaming at me to put as much distance between myself and that house as possible. The streets were empty, the world reduced to the sound of my ragged breath, my pounding footsteps, the horrible, all-consuming thought looping over and over in my mind—

*Was she following me? Was she right behind me?*

I didn’t stop. Not until I saw a gas station ahead, its bright fluorescent lights buzzing like a beacon. The cashier inside looked up in mild surprise as I burst through the door, breathless and wild-eyed, gripping the counter as I begged for a phone. The words spilled out of me in a frantic rush, barely coherent between gasps of air, but the cashier—whether out of genuine concern or simple obligation—handed me the store’s landline without asking questions. My hands trembled as I dialed 911, the ringing on the other end stretching unbearably long before a calm voice answered.

I didn’t know where to begin.

I tried to explain it, the words tumbling over each other in a feverish mess, like the ramblings of someone who had completely lost their grip on reality. But something in my voice must have convinced them that this was real, because they told me to stay put, and minutes later, the wailing cry of sirens cut through the night air.

The police arrived quickly—two officers stepping into the gas station, their presence somehow both commanding and unnervingly casual, as if this was just another call on just another night. One of them, a broad man with tired eyes, approached first, his expression neutral as he asked for my name and a rundown of what had happened. I tried my best to keep my voice steady, recounting everything from the moment I stepped onto the bus to the exact second I saw *her* standing inside my coat, her eyes watching me.

The officer listened carefully, his gaze flickering between me and his partner, who was jotting something down on a small notepad. When I finished, they exchanged a brief, unreadable glance before the first officer nodded. ""Alright. We need you to come with us and show us the house. You’ll stay in the car while we check it out. Just sit tight and let us do our job, alright?""

I hesitated, every fiber of my being resisting the thought of going back to that place, but I needed to *know.* Needed to see if she was still there. So I swallowed my fear, nodded, and followed them out to the police car.

The drive back was suffocating, the police radio crackling intermittently, the air inside thick with the faint scent of worn leather and cheap coffee. I sat in the back seat, my hands clasped tightly together in my lap, my knee bouncing involuntarily as I watched the city blur past. The closer we got, the heavier the dread became, sinking into my bones like cold lead.

When we finally pulled onto my street, my breath hitched. The house looked the same—nothing out of place, nothing obviously wrong—except for the front door, which still stood open, just as I had left it in my frantic escape.

The officers stepped out, moving in practiced, measured strides, their hands instinctively hovering near their holsters. I stayed put as instructed, my fingers digging into the fabric of my pants, my pulse drumming in my ears as I watched them approach the entrance. One of them called out—""Police!""—before disappearing inside, the other close behind, their flashlights bouncing off the walls as they moved deeper into the house.

The silence stretched, the minutes dragging unbearably long, the only sounds noticeable was the distant hum of the city, the soft patter of rain on the windshield, and my own shallow breathing. I strained my ears, trying to catch anything— but the house remained eerily still, like it was holding its breath.

Then—

A gunshot.

The sharp sound of it shattered the night, so sudden and violent that I flinched hard, my breath caught in my throat as I whipped my head toward the house. My vision tunneled, my mind struggling to process what had just happened, the deafening echo of the shot still ringing in my ears. 

Minutes passed. And then—movement.

One of the officers came rushing out, his expression taut, his movements quick but controlled as he reached for the radio clipped to his shoulder, muttering something I couldn’t make out. His gaze flickered toward the car for only a brief second before he strode toward the driveway, where two more patrol cars were already pulling up, their flashing lights washing over the wet pavement in frantic red and blue.

I opened the car door, barely registered myself speaking, ""What happened?!"" My throat felt tight, my chest constricted. ""Where’s the other officer?""

The cop exhaled sharply, glancing back toward the house before turning his gaze on me. ""She was upstairs,"" he said finally, his voice even but edged with unease. ""Hiding behind the bedroom door. The second my partner stepped inside, she lunged at him with a knife. I fired before she could make contact. She's down, but she's still moving. Still fighting.""

My stomach churned violently, my hands gripping my knees to keep them from shaking as more officers flooded into the house, EMTs close behind, their equipment rattling as they moved with urgency. I wanted to look away, wanted to shut my eyes and pretend none of this was real, but I couldn’t. I just stood there, frozen, leaning on the police car, my body locked in place, my mind struggling to keep up with the reality of what was happening.

Then they carried her out.

She fought them every step of the way, her body writhing, her limbs jerking against the restraints as two officers gripped her arms, another pinning down her legs as they struggled to strap her to a stretcher. Even with a bullet wound, even restrained, she was still trying to *get free,* her entire body vibrating with unnatural, frenzied energy.

Then one of the EMTs pulled out a syringe, uncapped it, and pressed the needle into her arm. Within seconds, her movements slowed. The struggle drained from her limbs, her breathing evening out, her body sagging against the stretcher as the sedative took hold.

But just as her eyelids began to flutter, just as the last bit of fight faded from her body, she turned her head. Her gaze found mine. Slowly, the rage drained from her face, twisting into a wide smile across her pale, sweat-slicked face in a way that sent a sickening, icy wave through my blood.

Then her eyelids slid shut, and finally, she was still. The EMTs took her away and the rest of that horrible day is still a blur. 

About a week later, I found a real estate agent. My house—once a place of warmth and familiarity, filled with memories—was tainted now, hollow and foreign, the walls no longer belonging to me. It didn’t matter that she was gone, locked up, I could still feel her, as if she could appear in every dark corner or nook at any time. The house felt ruined and I sold it within two months. I moved into the city, found an apartment close to work, always surrounded by people, the city lights and slowly found a sense of peace and belonging.

But, most importantly, I never had to take the bus again.",1,1747742400.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I still struggle a lot but have stopped talking to anyone about it. Something that always plays on my mind and I have only told my husband is that the night before I said goodbye to him when walking out the door (he was in his bedroom) and he didn’t say goodbye back. A little voice in my head told me to say it again because it might be the last time I see him….

I was 20 at the time and he had told me he was feeling anxious about a month before about starting his first job but he was doing a great job. He was going really well at school, even helping a friend study for maths who was falling behind. 

He broke up with his girlfriend over the summer but seemed to be doing ok and started out at a new gym. He actually had been there just before he got home and told me when he was planning on going next. 

The night before I told him I was going to pick him up after gym and he was going to show me the proteins I should buy and I was going to choose a flavour with him. I was a friends house studying and called him that I was running late to pick him up but he said he didn’t want to wait so caught the bus home. He didn’t seem upset with me and we talked about the sale ending the next day and he gave me his card to buy it on the way to my boyfriend’s house where I was staying the night. I checked he didn’t need it for lunch or anything and he said no and I was to pay him back when I got paid next. 

The next morning he went to school and then left before midday and we lost him. 

I still can’t get over not questioning the voice in my head. And I always feel so guilty about having his bank card because what if he had it and chose to go and get a coffee/food and sit in his feelings instead… 

I remember feeling so emotional myself, I had lost a friend in a car accident 2 months before, had just been on my first prac that finished the week before and was feeling very stressed about uni. I feel like I always in a ‘mood’ and just generally not nice to be around. I suffer with health anxiety now as a 30 year old, which is crippling at times with a 3 year old, I put on 40kg in about 2 years after and have never been able to lose much weight since so have really bad self esteem/confidence and also adds to my health anxiety. I go out of my way now to stand up for the person not in the room to stand up for themselves and I live every day just trying to be kind but ….. silence. If you’ve made it this far thank you.

TL;DR: These make completely different coffee. AeroPress is easy immersion brewing, OutIn Nano is manual espresso. Ultimately pick based on what you actually want to drink.

Brewing methods: The AeroPress uses immersion brewing with some pressure at the end, similar to a French press but cleaner. You get smooth, forgiving coffee that's hard to screw up. The OutIn Nano is a portable espresso machine where you get espresso shot at the push of a button. When you get it right, you get real espresso with crema. 

Size and travel: The AeroPress is bulkier than expected. Even the Go version needs the plunger, chamber, filters, and a separate cup. The OutIn Nano is genuinely compact with a built-in cup and fewer parts to track. 

Difficulty: The AeroPress is almost foolproof. Add grounds, pour water, stir, press. Even if you mess up timing or grind size, you still get decent coffee. The OutIn Nano requires properly setting up the machine (not a huge learning curve) I had about two weeks of experiment shots before getting the hang of it.

Coffee quality: The AeroPress makes clean, balanced coffee that works well with light roasts and makes good iced coffee or Americano-style drinks. Results are very consistent. The OutIn Nano, when properly dialed in, makes legitimate espresso that you could use for milk drinks. 

Cleanup: The AeroPress cleanup is satisfying - pop out the puck and rinse. Takes about 30 seconds. The OutIn Nano has more parts to disassemble and espresso residue that sticks more. Not awful but definitely more involved. 

My take: If you just want basic coffee without fuss, get the AeroPress. If you specifically need espresso and don't mind learning how to use it properly, get the OutIn Nano. I keep both around - AeroPress for daily coffee, OutIn Nano when I want espresso. I keep on reaching for OutIn Nano more than AeroPress because above all, the espresso shots from Nano are something divine.

Anyone else used both of these?  What did you think?

Hong KongCNN — 

Despite a 90-day truce in its trade war with the United States, China appears to be maintaining [tight control over its rare earth exports](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/business/china-trumps-trade-war-rare-earth-intl-hnk) – preserving a key source of leverage in future negotiations amid intensifying strategic rivalry with Washington.

As part of [last week’s trade agreement](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/12/business/us-china-trade-deal-announcement-intl-hnk) in Geneva to temporarily roll back tariffs, China pledged to suspend or remove the “non-tariff” countermeasures it imposed on the US since April 2.

That has left businesses scrambling to find out whether that promise applies to China’s export controls on seven rare earth minerals and associated products, which were [imposed on April 4](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/business/china-us-tariffs-retaliation-hnk-intl/index.html) as part of its retaliation against US President Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs on Chinese goods.

Magnets made of these heavy rare earth elements are an essential part of everything from iPhones and electric vehicles to big-ticket weapons like F-35 fighter jets and missile systems. Yet their supply is completely dominated by China.

Fresh off the plane from the trade talks in Geneva last week, US trade representative Jamieson Greer sought to ease concerns surrounding this potential vulnerability. In a [Fox News interview](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6372725330112), he answered affirmatively when asked whether China had agreed to lift its export restrictions on rare earths as part of the truce.

“Yep, the Chinese have agreed to remove those countermeasures,” Greer said. “If they don’t do those things, we’re going to be back in a different situation. But I expect they’ll remove them.”

However, there’s little sign to suggest China is removing its newly imposed rare earth export control regime. If anything, according to experts and industry insiders, Chinese authorities appear to be strengthening implementation and ramping up oversight.

The system, introduced in April, does not ban exports outright, but requires government approval for each shipment. That had caused weeks long holdups as companies navigated the new regime, fueling fears among a wide range of American industries from automobile to defense.

“I would not be shocked to find that Mr Greer is expressing what he hopes will happen versus what has actually been negotiated to happen,” said Jon Hykawy, president of the Toronto-based industry advisory firm Stormcrow Capital.

“These controls are intended … to ensure that China does not run short of some materials that are needed for domestic Chinese priorities,” said Hykawy.

Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said China’s export licensing regime is “here to stay” and “may stay for a long time,” allowing Beijing to retain its leverage in future trade talks with the US.

If the US were to turn around and renege on their tariff policy, China can easily withhold the required licenses, she said, adding that the licensing policy is dynamic by design, giving Beijing the power to decide which companies or countries can access its rare earth minerals and magnets at any given time.

# New export licenses

Following the Geneva talks, China’s Commerce Ministry removed [28 US firms](https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/syxwfb/art/2025/art_8762463760e1439bbb7451f5a59564b8.html) from its dual-use export control list and pulled [17 American companies](https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/xwfb/xwfyrth/art/2025/art_53ec1f591dba49a39b65fd89b6d73e6f.html) from another trade and investment backlist. But the ministry made no mention of any changes to the exports control on rare earth minerals and magnets.

A spokesperson for the ministry said she had “no information to share” on whether China is lifting the export controls at a regular news conference last Friday.

Instead, Chinese authorities [launched a crackdown](https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/xwfb/xwfyrth/art/2025/art_4bced5be87294c1a95dcc6ca72756d2e.html) on the smuggling of critical minerals – a broader category of resources that include rare earth elements. On May 12, the day US and China announced the tariff cuts, Chinese export regulators [convened a meeting](https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/syxwfb/art/2025/art_cb45af5894ba458fad7b06d5a0b8d7a5.html) with authorities from multiple mineral-rich provinces with the aim to “prevent the illegal outflow of strategic minerals” and “strengthen oversight across every link of the production and supply chain.”

On the same day, Yuyuan Tantian, a social media account affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV, said in a [post](https://weibo.com/7040797671/PruP65rqu?pagetype=profilefeed) that “China’s rare earth export controls are continuing.”

Meanwhile, after weeks of delay, China has started to issue export permits for rare earth magnets – a development that experts say shows the new licensing system is up and running, rather than restrictions being eased.

Two Chinese rare earth magnet producers told CNN they had recently received licenses for exporting products containing dysprosium and terbium – elements that are often added to create more heat resistance in high-performance magnets commonly used in the automobile, aerospace and military industries.

The approvals are granted under a “one batch, one license” rule, meaning a new permit is required for each shipment and cannot be reused, according to the companies.

One of the companies received its first export license for a shipment heading to Southeast Asia. It has since been granted several other licenses for exports to Europe, including the carmaker Volkswagen in Germany.

“We haven’t received any indications about the (export control) system easing up,” a person close to the company told CNN.

Volkswagen said in a statement that its suppliers have received indications that “a limited number of export licenses have been granted.”

# Question mark over US defense firms

Baskaran, from CSIS, said that instead of lifting the export controls on rare earths, China removed 28 American firms from its export control list. That means those companies, mostly aerospace and defense firms, are no longer banned from accessing dual-use materials from China, and their Chinese suppliers can now apply for export licenses for rare earth magnets.

But it remains to be seen whether Beijing will ultimately give out licenses to American defense firms.

China’s rare earth export controls were “specifically designed to hit the US defense industry, and I cannot envision China stepping back from that,” said Thomas Kruemmer, director of the Singapore-based mineral and metal supply chain firm Ginger International Trade and Investment.

Under the new rules, exporters must include information about end-users in their applications, which take up to 45 working days to be approved.

“I am sure that in case of defense contractors, the Chinese Commerce Ministry will raise pesky questions, which the Americans may be unwilling to answer or may need Pentagon permission to answer,” Kruemmer said.

“This way they can conveniently delay the issuance of dual-use product export licenses beyond the self-set 45-day deadline, perhaps even beyond this 90-day (truce) window. And it still has the option to reject the license applications anyway.”

The licensing rules can also offer China visibility into where the rare earth magnets end up.

“You can still get the material, but you have to fill out paperwork, describe to China who the end user is. You’re going to give all this information and then (China) can see inside your downstream customer base and use and look for further vulnerability,” said James Kennedy, president of Three Consulting, a rare earths consultancy based in St Louis, Missouri.

“So it’s very smart. They get a looking glass into what you’re doing.”

# ‘Geopolitical weapon’

For decades, the US and other countries have been dependent on China’s supply of rare earth minerals, which are difficult, costly and environmentally polluting to extract and process. China accounts for 61% of global mined rare earth production, but its control over the processing stage is much higher at [92%](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2024/outlook-for-key-minerals) of the global output, according to the International Energy Agency.

The April export controls are far from the first time Beijing has leveraged its dominance in the industry. In 2010, China halted shipments of rare earths to Japan for nearly two months over a territorial dispute. In late 2023, it imposed a ban on rare earth extraction and separation technologies.

Beijing has also curbed exports of other critical minerals that are vital to the economy and global supply chains – including outright bans on the shipments of gallium, germanium, antimony and so-called superhard materials to the US.

“China’s control over rare earths, cobalt, gallium and all these critical materials is a geopolitical weapon of never-before measured and seen effect,” Kennedy said. “And at the end of the day, what this does is, it creates a lot of uncertainty. And that in itself is a powerful weapon.”

Baskaran said that by granting some of its first export licenses of rare earth magnets to Volkswagen, China is sending a pointed geopolitical message.

“Germany is at the height of geopolitical crossfire. The US is unhappy that Germany has been overtly quite friendly with China. So, by giving it one of the first licenses, China is sending a very positive signal in the Chinese-German relationship,” she said. “In this era of rising tension between the world’s two geopolitical superpowers, the licensing system may stay as a larger form of power.”

# MAY 20th, 2025~ CRITICAL MINERALS: The Hidden Battleground in US-China Trade War

[Critical Minerals: US-China Trade War's Hidden Battleground](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/critical-minerals-definition-examples-2025/)

https://preview.redd.it/tgpddqo55x1f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c12d37a4f6b28a8eebc6869a32bdbbf67e1ba591

# Understanding the Basics: What Are Critical Minerals?

Critical minerals are raw materials deemed essential for economic and national security, yet vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. These include rare earth elements (REEs) like neodymium and dysprosium, as well as minerals such as antimony, bismuth, cobalt, gallium, and tungsten. Unlike common minerals, these resources combine strategic importance with limited availability and geopolitical complexity.

The U.S. Geological Survey officially designates 50 minerals as ""critical,"" with 24 specifically highlighted for defense applications. These minerals form the foundation of modern technology, from smartphones to fighter jets, and increasingly, [critical minerals in energy transition](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/critical-minerals-energy-transition-2025-energy-security/).

# Definition & Examples

Critical minerals are characterized by three key factors:

* **Strategic importance**: Essential for advanced technologies, defense systems, or energy transition
* **Supply risk**: Concentrated production in a limited number of countries
* **Limited substitutability**: Few or no viable alternatives exist for their applications

The most prominent critical minerals include:

* **Rare Earth Elements (REEs)**: A group of 17 chemically similar metallic elements used in magnets, catalysts, and electronics
* **Antimony**: Enhances flame resistance in military vehicle components
* **Bismuth**: Used in medical applications and as a lead replacement
* **Tungsten**: Vital for hardening steel in defense applications
* **Cobalt**: Essential for lithium-ion batteries and jet engines
* **Gallium**: Used in semiconductors, LEDs, and 5G infrastructure

# Why Are They ""Critical""?

Critical minerals earn their designation through a complex interplay of technological necessity and geopolitical vulnerability. Their criticality stems from three primary factors:

**Essential Applications**

These minerals form the backbone of modern technology and defense systems:

* **High-tech electronics**: Smartphones, computers, and advanced sensors
* **Defense systems**: Guidance systems, night vision, and communications equipment
* **Clean energy**: Wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicle batteries

>

**Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**

The production of critical minerals is highly concentrated, creating significant supply risks:

* China controls approximately 70% of global rare earth production
* The U.S. imports 70% of its rare earth elements from China
* For some minerals like gallium, U.S. dependence on Chinese imports reaches as high as 92%

**Processing Bottlenecks**

Mining is only part of the equation; refining and processing create additional vulnerabilities:

* China refines 90% of global cobalt and lithium
* Specialized processing facilities take years and billions to develop
* Environmental regulations in Western nations increase production costs

# How Did Critical Minerals Become a Strategic Lever for China?

China's dominance in critical minerals didn't happen by accident. Through decades of strategic investment and policy support, Beijing transformed what was once considered a niche mining sector into a powerful geopolitical lever. This evolution represents one of the most successful examples of industrial policy in modern history.

# China's Dominance by the Numbers

China's control over critical minerals extends far beyond its borders, creating global dependencies that provide significant geopolitical leverage:

**(ARTICLE SHORTENED TO MEET REDDIT WORD LIMITS)**

# US Dependency on Chinese Supply Chains

American dependence on Chinese minerals extends far beyond simple trade statistics, creating vulnerabilities that affect core national security capabilities:

**Defense Applications**

The U.S. military's reliance on Chinese minerals creates strategic vulnerabilities:

* A single F-35 fighter jet requires approximately 417kg of rare earth materials, according to Prof. Wang Xiaosong of Renmin University
* Each F-35 contains 920 components that depend on rare earth elements
* A U.S. Air Force internal report concluded that a ""6-month REE shortage would halt 85% of aircraft production""
* A 2025 Department of Defense audit revealed that 73% of munitions plants lack alternative mineral suppliers

# MAY 19th, 2025~Expert tells U.S. senators Canada is a key ally on critical minerals

[Expert tells U.S. senators Canada is a key ally on critical minerals](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/usa/2025/05/expert-tells-u-s-senators-canada-is-a-key-ally-on-critical-minerals)

https://preview.redd.it/4tagfan46x1f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=30e6bea92e85f0adf7841068db7152662779e66d

WASHINGTON — An expert in critical minerals told U.S. senators Canada will be a key ally in efforts to reduce America’s reliance on Chinese supply — after President Donald Trump spent months claiming the United States doesn’t need anything from its northern neighbour.

Gracelin Baskaran, director of critical minerals security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., told the Senate finance committee that the U.S. only has 1.3 per cent of the world’s rare earths.

“The uncomfortable truth is we are not going to do this alone,” she said.

The hearing on trade in critical supply chains also included experts in semiconductors, medical technology and soybean farming who spoke about the ways Trump’s sweeping tariffs are affecting their industries.

Rare earth elements are used in the manufacture of electric vehicles, powerful magnets, smartphones, fighter jets and submarines, among other products. China, however, has long dominated the global industry, particularly in processing rare earth minerals.

Trump has said he wants the United States to lead the global critical minerals trade but has been sending conflicting messages about how he expects the U.S. to achieve that goal.

He signed a controversial executive order to pursue deepsea mining and in April launched a trade investigation that would be a precondition for hitting processed critical mineral imports with tariffs. Trump forced Ukraine to sign a critical minerals agreement in exchange for continued U.S. support in its defence against Russia’s aggression.

When Trump escalated the trade war between the world’s two largest economies in April with massive tariffs, China responded with retaliatory duties and export restrictions on various critical mineral exports to the U.S., causing anxiety throughout supply chains.

The U.S. “faces a severe level of vulnerability in its access to minerals,” Baskaran said, adding that imposing sector-specific duties on ore imports would make it too expensive to develop processing capabilities in the United States. Tariffs on countries that have critical minerals geographically unavailable to the United States could also hinder American industry as China works to further its influence, she said.

Trump implemented a 10 per cent universal tariff on nearly all countries in April, saying he’d allow 90 days for nations to make a deal.

He slapped 25 per cent economywide duties on Canada and Mexico the month prior, then partially walked them back a few days later for imports compliant under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement on trade, called CUSMA. Trump also imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum and automobiles. 

Canada has 34 critical minerals and metals and Canadian officials have been cycling through Washington for months making the case that partnering together is a better strategy to push back on China. Ontario Premier Doug Ford called it “Fortress Am-Can,” while then-energy minister Jonathan Wilkinson called for a resource alliance.

Canada and the U.S. Department of Defense already have a co-investment deal to accelerate Canadian mining development and strengthen critical minerals supply chains.

Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. doesn’t need anything from Canada.

“We don’t need their Cars, we don’t need their Energy, we don’t need their Lumber, we don’t need ANYTHING they have, other than their friendship,” Trump said in a post on social media before meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney in Washington recently.

Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, told the hearing that Canada has an abundance of critical minerals and is co-operative with the U.S.

“Instead of working with Canada on critical minerals trade, the president has targeted Canadian imports with truly reckless tariffs while making concessions to the Chinese government to try to access their mineral reserves,” she said.

When asked if the Trump administration should prioritize trade with Canada, Baskaran said “Canada is going to be one of our strongest allies if we are going to reduce reliance on China.”

Baskaran said the critical minerals sector was already integrating between both countries. Canada’s uranium reserves are 10 times larger than America’s and the U.S. is increasing its capabilities for enrichment, she said.

Canadian companies refine zinc produced in the United States, creating germanium used in American manufacturing.

“Given the mining, refining and manufacturing, they are so vertically integrated,” Baskaran said. “We will not be able to do it without strengthening our relationship with Canada.”

As [Gaston Cuny](https://investx.fr/en/author/gaston_cuny/), writer at InvestX, said himself.

[Link to the article](https://investx.fr/en/crypto-news/top-3-memecoins-bonk-popcat-kendu/)

Recently, $KENDU has been mentioned in this article besides two big names in the memecoin scene: 

* $BONK: $423 million market cap
* $POPCAT: $1.7 billion market cap

If you compare these marketcaps with $KENDU, which is sitting at $32 million as we speak, KENDU has a lot of upwards potential! In June 2024, $KENDU reach its all time high of $286 million marketcap. From the levels we are at right now, that is a solid +700%. I'd say open your agenda and look at the date, next month is June.. 👀

**This is what Gaston wrote down about $KENDU:**

>KENDU Inu : A Rising Star among Memecoins

>KENDU Inu (KENDU) has emerged as one of the top-performing memecoins this week, showing an impressive 99% increase, although the pace has slightly slowed over the past 24 hours. Holderscan data shows that over 68% of KENDU holders own more than $10 worth of tokens, reflecting strong investor confidence in the future potential of this token.

[Source: TradingView](https://preview.redd.it/mdtk42e5ax1f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72d0da8f31dfb52290eea0297f54dc4f74141c2b)

>If KENDU manages to secure $0.00003063 as support, it could leverage the positive market signals to surpass $0.00004246, or even reach $0.00005042. However, if selling pressure outweighs the bullish sentiment, a drop below $0.00003063 could lead to a decline to $0.00001919. Such a development would challenge the positive outlook and indicate further downside potential for KENDU.



There is a reason Gaston mentioned KENDU, the community is putting in real work! Let me give you a few examples.

**Kendu Games: AAA Dev Comes Out of Retirement**

This is the biggest news. [Coop](https://x.com/WhatDidCoopSay), a community member, is now launching a legitimate game studio under the $KENDU umbrella, named; Kendu Games. Not a half-baked crypto game or a easy cash-grab. A full-scale traditional RPG, with serious developers. The lead dev? A former triple AAA game developer and BioWare veteran who worked on Dragon Age, Mass Effect, and Baldur’s Gate. He literally came out of retirement for this, purely because he believes in what Kendu is doing. The plan is to create a Skyrim-style RPG, followed by a roguelite later. No crypto gimmicks in the gameplay. But the kicker is that game profits will be used to buy Kendu tokens and fund the community. Here's a small breakdown, from all the profits 10% will go into a Kendu Games Business treasury and 5% will be donated to the Kendu Community wallet. let's say they hit one million copies sold, which is likely to happen, that’s an estimated $1.6 million in buy pressure for Kendu. That’s just from one game.

[Kendu Games X Profile](https://x.com/KenduGames)

**Decentralized Brand, Real-World Impact**

Kendu isn’t just building in digital spaces. The brand is exploding in the real world too. Members of the community have launched Kendu Coffee, Kendu Energy Drinks, Kendu Vodka, Kendu Nights (club promotions), and even Kendu Esports, a League of Legends team. What makes this different from every other project? It’s all permissionless. Anyone can build under the Kendu brand without needing to ask for approval. There is no centralized entity handing out licenses. This is decentralized brand ownership in action.

[Kendu Energy Promo Video](https://reddit.com/link/1kr2v11/video/s8zz05pj9x1f1/player)

**""We Don’t Gamble, We Work""**

This has become the core philosophy of Kendu. The project isn’t about flipping tokens or hoping for pumps. It’s about showing up and putting in the work. Token holders treat Kendu like a startup. There are daily goals, power hours, and people grinding social content and launching real-life products. The Kendu community is working, not speculating.

**No Paid Hype, No Insiders**

One of the most refreshing parts of Kendu is how it’s grown. There are no paid influencers, no whales with insider allocations, and no VC dumping risk. Everyone buys with their own money. Everyone contributes with their own effort. It’s raw, organic, and surprisingly effective. The project has reached over 18,000 holders this way. Not through hype, but through work.

**Wormhole Bridge: Building for the Long Game**

Kendu has also quietly launched bridges to the Solana and Base chains. This wasn’t a PR stunt or hype strategy. It was a tactical move, preparing for the moment when momentum returns. The goal is simple: dominate the top gainers list across multiple chains in the long term. This kind of forward-thinking infrastructure sets Kendu apart from typical meme coins. And the cool addition to this; let's say Solana moves up in price? This will automatically drive the price of $KENDU without any added buy pressure.

[$KENDU Available on 3 Chains](https://preview.redd.it/f0rks0vtax1f1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=718fe4bb0d117056c10b2ae0183ba7df00decfba)

  
**TL;DR**

$KENDU was recently mentioned alongside big names like $BONK and $POPCAT, but its market cap is still much smaller, a very high ROI from these levels. A former AAA game developer is making a full RPG for Kendu, and profits from the game will be used to buy KENDU tokens. The community is also creating real products like Kendu Coffee and Energy Drinks. There are no paid influencers or big investors, just people working hard together. Bullish on $KENDU.

I (27 F) was flatmates with this girl (26 F) for over a year. We really grew close and became best friends, would spend all our free time together, and really got along well. When our lease ended, we both moved in with our partners, within the same city. We kept in touch after and met regularly. 

There were some shitty traits about her tho. She was constantly hinting at me breaking up with my bf, even though I never complained to her about him, and I'm happy with him. We've also been together for 4 years now and are getting along very well. She, on the other hand, was constantly suffering with her bf, as he always treated her like shit, and would make her life miserable. I always listened and supported her in every way I could, and eventually they broke up. 

I was always there for her and supported her when she was feeling down. I'd buy her snacks and would go over to her place to watch series, eat pizza, go for walks, etc. However, she didn't stop saying that I must break up with my bf, and that we should just move in together, the two of us, and live like in the good old times when we were flatmates. She always grabbed every opportunity to say something nasty about my bf, or belittle him in every way, even though they hardly ever met, and those times he was very nice to her. I voiced this to her a few times that I don't like how she talks about him and that she should stop making these nasty comments and constantly talk about me breaking up, but she ignored me. 

Fast forward a few months, she got a new colleague at the university where she works (I'm doing my master's degree there, and she works in administration in the same building), and they became good friends. She suggested we meet up, and I can get to know her new friend. I agreed and we met for coffee, but my friend was completely changed and behaved like she was a completely different person. It was like she had become a new person, as if she was just trying to impress this new friend so that she would find her ""cool"". I was completely shocked and didn't really know what to do in the situation. After this, I met my friend separately, and she was back to her old self. Then I met her a second time with the new friend, and she was again acting completely strange. 

I found this super childish, and it irritated me that she just acts so differently with her. I am not jealous of their friendship at all, I was actually happy that she found someone else as well, with whom she can spend time. This was another problem with our friendship sometimes, that she would just want me to spend all my free time with her, and when I told her I'd go somewhere with my bf, she would get offended. She once got furious at me that I went on a holiday with him instead of her. 

After this, I met the two girls one more time, but it was the same shit again. Then I gradually started distancing myself and turning down the offers to hang out. I once invited her to our home, and she acted very rude towards my bf, didn't even greet him, and just ignored him in his own home. 

So after this, I realized (I know it took me too long) that this is just toxic and I should let it go. I didn't meet her again, I always just found an excuse not to hang out, which she obviously realized were just made-up lies. I still messaged her every week or so, just to check on her if she's okay. The last time I messaged her was about 8 months ago, but she left me on read and never replied ever since. I also didn't message her again. 

Now I am about to start my master's thesis project, and I will be working in the same building as them. I'm kind of nervous that I will see her in the corridors and I wouldn't know what to say. She will also be with her new friend, probably, if they are still good friends. I guess I shouldn't care about what they think, but it just makes me anxious to think that I'll have to see them all the time for at least a year. In her eyes, I'm probably the bad person who just stopped being her friend or whatever, but she is just extremely selfish, and she was trying to undermine my relationship for no reason. 

I want some thoughts on this whole thing and advice on how to handle this new situation. Thank you if you've read all of this!",1,1747741260.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1kr2nmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kr2nmi/can_funmit_replacement_water_filter_enhance_your/,Can Funmit Replacement Water Filter Enhance Your Breville Espresso Machine Performance Review?,"The Funmit BES880 Replacement Water Filter for Breville Espresso Machines has been a part of my daily coffee routine for weeks now. What initially drew me to this product was its promise to improve the coffee experience by utilizing advanced filtration technology. Naturally, with my Breville Barista Pro at the center of my kitchen, finding a reliable water filter replacement was pretty high on my list. Through countless morning coffees and a few late-night espressos, I’ve put this product to the test. Let’s talk about its pros and cons, features, and whether it’s worth diving into.

**Design and Build Quality**

One of the first things I noticed is the compact yet thoughtful design. Measuring just 1.8""D x 2.01""W x 4.72""H, the size is an effortless fit for Breville espresso machines, including popular models like the Barista Touch and Oracle Touch. The added silicone pad and fine filter at the base immediately stood out, appearing to be a unique touch for enhanced water filtration. The material, a combination of silicone and activated carbon, doesn’t scream luxury but feels durable enough for its purpose. Unlike bulky or cumbersome filters, this one is almost invisible once installed, and I appreciated how efficiently it integrates with the machine.

**Ease of Installation**

I have to say, if there’s one feature that won me over instantly, it’s the ease of installation. The process is straightforward and took less than five minutes, including the pre-use preparation. Fully immersing the filter in water to generate air bubbles and squeezing it gently did feel a bit extra, but that’s just part of how it activates its filtering powers. Sliding it into the filter holder, then the water tank, required minimal effort. Breville owners, like myself, who dread complicated installations will find this to be a big relief.

**Focus on Performance**

Performance-wise, I noticed an improvement in the flavor of my coffee almost immediately. The advanced micro-filtration utilizing coconut-activated carbon and ion resin works effectively to reduce chlorine, heavy metals, and scale buildup. My machine’s performance seemed less hindered, and the coffee? Unquestionably better! The filter retained essential minerals, stabilizing calcium carbonate levels, which enhanced the aroma and balanced the flavor. However, if you lean towards being an espresso perfectionist, you’ll likely notice the difference even more vividly.

**Key Benefits**

- Effectively filters out harmful substances while retaining beneficial minerals.
- Improves the longevity of Breville machines by reducing scale buildup.
- Straightforward installation and quick activation process.
- Enhanced coffee flavor, stabilizing aroma and taste nuances.

**Drawbacks**

Not everything is flawless with this product. For all the positives it offers, let’s not ignore the areas where the filter could do better.

- The three-month replacement recommendation feels too frequent for some.
- Admittedly, the tiny silicone pad and fine filter at the base seem prone to wear over extended use.
- A few customers have noted compatibility inconsistencies, although I personally didn’t face this issue.

**Product Rivals**

While Funmit BES880 shines uniquely, it’s worth mentioning a few competitors in the water filter space. The official Breville ClaroSwiss filter, though costly, is undoubtedly its most significant direct competitor. ClaroSwiss stands out for its premium build and efficient water filtration, but the price tag can be prohibitive for regular replacements. Meanwhile, generic third-party filters, sold in bulk for cheap, may cut costs but often lack NSF Certification, which Funmit maintains. Although competitors offer certain perks, Funmit finds a balance between affordability and high filtering standards.

**Worth Every Penny**

Investing in replacement water filters isn’t exactly an area where one gets overly excited about spending money. Yet, the Funmit replacement offers an appealing balance between affordability and functionality. Comparable models, like ClaroSwiss, may feel like overkill for what this filter already accomplishes at a reasonable price. Financially conscious buyers will find this product much more budget-friendly without sacrificing critical filtration features.

She’d like to live somewhere that has grocery stores and things to do nearby (coffee shops, gym, painting, etc.) that ideally has 1) a convenient commute to work, 2) convenient access to the East Bay (family in Berkeley and Oakland she’ll want to visit frequently), and 3) convenient to get to Presidio Heights (her best friend will be living near there). 

By convenient I don’t necessarily mean close or even a short commute, I mean direct and safe (i.e. as few of buses, trains, trams, etc. to get to each of those locations). I know for the east bay it’d likely be a bus + BART unless living near a BART stop in SF. She’s open to living in the east bay too.

Near Lafayette Park seems to match these criteria since it’s:
- 45 or 1 bus + BART to/from Berkeley
- 1 bus to/from Salesforce Tower
- 1 bus to/from Presidio Heights

Curious any thoughts/recommendations anyone has and if these buses are generally safe. If leaving the office late, she’ll Uber/Lyft/Waymo home.

Any guidance for an east coast transplant headed to the Bay would be super helpful!

Thank you!

1kr2h75,https://www.reddit.com/r/originalloquat/comments/1kr2h75/strange_fruit_horticultural_horror_2100_words/,Strange Fruit (Horticultural Horror) (2100 Words),"Andy had not necessarily been looking for a wife. It had just happened, as naturally as winter becomes spring. 



They'd been introduced by a mutual friend for a joke. ‘Flower Power’ and ‘Office Hours’, but things had just clicked. 



Their first date had been at a vegan place, and Kerry had appeared, her hair in dreadlocks like fibrous jungle roots. 



They had spoken of crystals, Reiki, and water divining. He had no such deep-held ‘quirky beliefs,' which was perhaps why he took a shine to her. We look for in others what we lack in ourselves. 



They had a nontraditional wedding. All the guests were encouraged to go barefoot (it was held at the beach), and a monk conducted the ceremony. 



In lieu of wedding gifts, the couple asked well-wishers to donate to a fund to protect the Chinese River Dolphin.  



Their lives rolled out in front of them like an immaculate slice of green turf. 



…



After a business conference at Pebble Beach, Andy became hooked on golf. There were no courses near their house, so he cordoned off a section of the garden for a putting green, which he maintained with fanatic zeal, hand-cutting the fringe with scissors.



But Kerry had entirely different arboreal ideas. She scoffed at the neat lawns of their neighbours in suburbia. She recounted the history of the English gentry, who left a clear patch of grass around their properties as a status symbol. They were so rich they did not have to grow anything- as the peasants starved. 



Her section was all wildflowers and tropical plants that grew ferociously in southern climes. Andy was fighting a losing battle to maintain his manicured Eden. 



…



‘Andy!’ she shouted from the decking. 



He turned like a guilty schoolboy caught pulling the wings off a fly. 



Attached to his back was a tank of chemical herbicide. He was liberally dousing sections of Kerry’s side of the garden. 



‘It’s…’ he paused, out of ideas. 



He took his telling off like usual, head bowed, looking at the sage and sea salt candles on the kitchen table. 



‘Cancer,’ she continued, ‘neurological disorders, and not to mention sperm count.’ 



After a year of trying for a baby without success, they’d visited a specialist. Andy had a low count. His swimmers were not so much swimmers as floaters. 



That is when he really noticed her militancy ramp up. She became obsessed with microplastics in semen. She made him cut out alcohol and caffeine from his diet. She even tried to get him a special dispensation so he would not have to go through the X-ray scanners at the airport. 



‘I’m sorry, sweetie,’ he said. ‘I’ll do better.’ 



He was still turning these words over when he got the call. 



Kerry had taken her bicycle down to the local Whole Foods when an Amazon delivery truck struck her. 



His wife was dead. 



… 



Dazed. That is how he felt. The death of his young wife was the only remarkable thing to ever happen to him. 



His neighbour, Mrs Carmichael, found him early one morning on the front lawn in his dressing gown, staring into space. 



‘Dear, are you ok?’ 



He could not entirely remember how he’d ended up out there.



‘I was so sorry to hear about your wife,’ she continued, ‘such a nice girl.’ 



‘Thanks,’ Andy mumbled. ‘I mean, thank you.’ 



‘I’ve made you these,’ she said, ‘You know, when Mr Carmichael died, it was the little things that got me through the days.’ 



She presented him with a plastic box of coffee cream cupcakes. 



‘Oh,’ he said, ‘I’m not.’ 



He paused. He was about to say he was not allowed caffeine and definitely not in a plastic box, but that was not true. He did not have to worry about motility because his wife was lying in a cool room of the undertaker’s, her head squashed like an overripe watermelon. 



He took the cupcakes and thanked her. Once inside, he stuffed them into his face two at a time. 



… 



Her last will and testament contained a rather large surprise. 



The day after the funeral, he stood on the patio, an iced Americano in his hand, looking at the back garden. The grass was flattened, trampled by mourners. 



Dead centre of Kerry’s side was a freshly planted tree, inside of which lay her mummified corpse. 



It was a service offered by a Florida company called ‘Gaia Funeral,’ which specialised in tree pod burials. 



His wife was human compost. 



...



Kerry had been a trust fund kid. 



That was why he was there to see his lawyer, Mr Port. 



Port was one of those old-school attorneys with a qualification from a college that no longer existed and probably never had. 



In his office, an American flag was spread over the back wall, and an entire key lime pie sat on the desk.  



The large man was distracted as he took out the relevant documents, side-eying the sweet treat. 



Port noticed him noticing. 



‘My wife makes them. You’d like a piece?’



‘No, thank you.’ 



‘You’d like a piece?!’ 



Before Andy had a chance to object further, he bellowed at his secretary. ‘Beryl, two plates and two forks.’ 



‘The thing about key lime pie,’ he said, shoving a piece into his round face, ‘is obviously the limes. Marianne, that’s my wife, she gets her limes straight from the Keys, none of those Persian interlopers… Are you a gardener, Andy?’ 



‘Yes, I mean no. I’m a greenkeeper, you could say. I have a little project out back of my house. My wife,’ he paused, ‘she was.’ 



‘Ah yes,’ Port had the decency to put down his fork as they got down to business, ‘So the conditions of the trust are a little complicated. Any proceeds 'should' go to a rewilding project in Bolivia.’ 



‘What do you mean complicated?’ 



Port leant forward, the wheels of his office chair squealing in protest. ‘*Should* is not exactly a legally binding term. I mean its close cousin is *could*, and closer cousin is *perhaps*.’ 



He smiled at his analogy. 



‘I do not want to go against my wife’s wishes.'



He paused. 



On the way to the lawyers, he’d passed a store selling sit-on mowers. With a sit-on mower, he could cut his green like they did at Augusta National.



‘No, no,’ Port held up his hands. ‘All I’m saying is that when people set up these things, they sometimes leave the wording loose to give a loved one leeway, interpretive, you know, like poetry.’ 



‘I suppose,’ he replied. ‘A portion could be set aside for the rewilding project and the rest, well, she is buried in the garden, so it’s her home.’ 



Port peered at him; he hadn’t been privy to the burial pod. 



‘What I mean is…’ Andy continued. 



‘Andy, that’s your business.’ Port held up his hands. ‘I don’t care where you buried your wife. My business is helping you…Now, would you like another piece of key lime?’ 



…



Maintaining a small pitch and putt in Florida went against the laws of nature. 



The phrase: ‘civilization is just a clearing in the forest’ was perfectly apt. 



Sometimes, Andy would disappear for a business conference, and all hell had broken out upon the hallowed surface.  



Beggarweed, dandelion, crabgrass, their demon seeds sprouting from his sporting paradise. 



He began to realise the problem was structural. It was the root of the root, the bud of the bud– Kerry’s side of the garden. 



Wildflowers were wild for a reason. Their niche was invasiveness. Tropical sage and spiderwort. He’d stroke a putt perfectly, and it’d hit a turnflower sprout and bounce away from the hole. 



Slowly, almost subconsciously, he began to wrestle away control of the garden from the forces of botanical chaos. 



Out came the wildflowers, and in went a driving net. Gone were the bird feeders, and in went the birdie makers. Yet one problem remained. 



In the six months after Kerry’s death, her tree grew at a remarkable speed. It took nutrients from the Earth, so in drier spells, the grass grew in haphazardly. 



But worse was the fruit scattered all around. They were odd, about the size and shape of pears, but a light grey colour. He cut into one, and to his horror, a multitude of seeds spilt out. 



He reunited with an old acquaintance his wife hated: the herbicide sprayer. He couldn’t bring himself to spray her tree directly. Instead, he’d let out a yawn, stretch his arms and let the spray ‘accidentally’ mist the tree. 



…



Outside, a storm collected over the Gulf, clouds piled on clouds. 



He flipped on the Golf Channel, where a Korean female golfer was detailing, in a short skirt, how to improve your short game. 



He set his scotch and ice down on the table. 



Retrieving a box of tissues, he flicked on a porn tube site and found something to his taste, ‘fun on the fairways– pros teach amateurs how to swing.’ 



It did not seem so sordid, he thought, watching ‘erotica’ on a 60-inch plasma under lighting designed by an Icelandic optics engineer. 



When he was finished, he looked down into the crumpled mass of Kleenex. Low sperm count? Yeah right. 



Lightning forked the sky, and the rain fell in sheets. 



Through the large bay window, he noticed something curious over his putting green. A boulder of some kind. 



He slid from the sofa, flushed the tissues and washed his hands. 



Another flash, this time unmistakable. It was not a boulder. It was attached to the tree. 



Wrestling with a Callaway rain jacket, he slid open the rear patio door. It was a big storm, all right. Not far off hurricane force. There’d be a clean-up job in the morning if play was to resume. 



He stepped onto the grass, and one of the fruits exploded under his boat shoes. 



‘Goddamn it.’ 



He continued as if on a minefield. It was not exactly clear what was going on because the wind had knocked over his floodlights.



He could discern something was not right with the tree. For one glorious moment, he thought perhaps it had been blown over, and he checked for his wife’s skewered corpse hanging from the roots.



But no, hanging from its branches was one of those grey fruits, except this one was mammoth, the size of a fridge. 



It fell to the ground and split open, juice flowing from the top of the crevice. He touched it. It was red, almost like jam or jelly. 



And then a hand took his. 



He fell onto the grass, scuttling back. 



The shell cracked open, revealing its innards. But it was no nut; it was a human, and not just any human. 



‘Kerry?’ He said. 



She was as naked as the day she was born and covered in the placenta of the fruit. 



She opened her mouth to speak, and a slurry of seeds spilt off her tongue. 



She glanced at her husband and then at her flesh. She was (almost)immaculate, no signs of the accident that had killed her, yet a painful-looking red rash streaked her milk skin. 



‘What did I tell you about the herbicide, Andy?’ 



His eyes were as wide as silver salver plates, his mouth open like a golf hole. 



She reached out, taking him by the face. 



And then: 



Wham. 



With superhuman strength, she tossed him through the air, slamming into the trunk. 



Kerry took a few steps in his direction over the sodden earth and watched as the light exited his eyes, his nutrient-rich blood watering the roots of her tree of life. 



… 



Mrs Carmichael’s eyes were not as they’d once been. 



She looked at the young woman through the screen door lit from behind by the kind of bright sunshine that follows a big storm. 



‘You look,’ she said, squinting, ‘You look exactly like that girl who used to live next door. The one hit by the mailman.’ 



Kerry was dressed in a summer dress, the only item Andy had not thrown away. 



‘Kerry was my twin sister.’ She turned, showing her back where the chemical burn was. ‘The only way to tell us apart was this birthmark.’ 



‘Well, I’m terribly sorry for your loss.’ 



‘Thank you. That’s what I came about. Andy and I have set up a foundation in her name. Kerry loved her neighbourhood, and she loved nature.’ 



Mrs Carmichael opened the screen door and took the small paper bag of seeds handed to her. 



‘If you’d plant these in your garden in her honour.’ 



‘What a lovely idea,’ Mrs Carmichael answered. 



Kerry turned, her summer dress swaying in the wind. 



‘Dear, what are they, the seeds?’ The old lady said from the porch. 



‘Oh, you’ll recognise them.’ 



She breathed in the scent of Mrs Carmichael’s flowers and smiled. 



Next Spring would be a bumper harvest of strange fruit.

I need some help with some new and interesting storylines for my sims. I am onto the third generation, still mostly playing with the second. Here is their story so far: I started off with myself (Sally) and my boyfriend (Tom) as young adults. Sally had always dreamed of going to school and being successful, she is super ambitious and works very hard. She goes off to university studying robotics, does the whole long distance thing with Tom, sometimes he would even come to visit. Once she finished school she and tom both got jobs, her in a career inline with her degree and Tom as a comedian. They get to work and make the big bucks being a couple of DINKS (duel income no kids). Sally adopts a dog, life’s going pretty well, kind of average stuff nothing too interesting. Tom eventually pops the question and of course she says yes, get pregnant before the wedding and has their first born, Rain, be the flower girl at their wedding. As life continues, they end up having two more kiddos, River and Sage.

 All the babies are super awesome, very smart, and they all have their own little quirks about them. Rain is athletic and very smart. She loves loves loves animals and it really hit her the most when the family dog passed away. Rain is also a go getter, she works for what she wants, she also has a passion for pottery. River is extremely talented and gifted in music. Before he finished high school he had wrote a few hit songs on the piano that did and continues to do very well, he’s more of a loner but he is also very intelligent. Sage is an innovator, externally smart and ambitious just like her mom. She loves to paint and is quite good at it too, creating a few masterpieces pretty early on in life. If there is one this about this family is that they all love eachother very very much, they would do anything for each other. Family is always first when it comes to them.   

They all applied to college and received various scholarships as well as played on the school soccer team. Rain has had a few love interests in high school but mostly just flings and having fun, when she got to university she very much focused on her schooling (but was able to have some fun doing so) River has always been too shy to make any real substantial friendships outside of his family, he’d much prefer to be surrounded by his loved ones. Sage is very outgoing, popular, and all around a great person to be around. People seem to gravitate towards her and she’s always making genuine connections. 

During their college days, when they weren’t studying or practicing soccer, they did frequent to the bars always taking pictures everywhere they went. That’s where River met her. Jackie James, he fell for her instantly. Now he’s never had a girlfriend or anything before so this was a big step for him. With the support of his sisters he mustered up the courage to actually talk to her and they hit it off immediately. Now she’s over their apartment alll the time. One thing about her though, Rain and Sage do NOT like Jackie very much. She’s lowkey a mean girl and is very passive aggressive, especially when River isn’t around. But regardless they are happy for their brother and suck it up when he asked Jackie to move in with them. She basically made everyone’s life a living hell. 

After college, Sage (biology degree) went on to become a professional athlete since she was so successful in her soccer career, it wasn’t something she’s always dreamed of, but it is a pretty sweet gig. River went back to the university to be a professor and Sage (economics degree) had a part time job as a barista and was an administrator at the university as well. None of these kids were really perusing their dream careers and they always felt that something was missing, that they need to move to a new town and start fresh but they were all very comfortable and pretty successful. That is until Jackie (engaged with River at this point) became pregnant.

 River never expected to be a dad so soon in life, but non the less was ecstatic. Threw his everything into learning about parenting and what to expect, the sisters were so happy to become aunts. River and Jackie have a beautiful baby girl. Only thing is Jackie kinda hates kids and doesn’t help raise their daughter at all. River doesn’t mind too much. He loves his daughter and his happy family. Jackie is pissed. River spends all his time with their daughter and she feels like second place. Although this does lead to many many argument’s between them, Jackie doesn’t care all that much because she’s actually been cheating on River for quite some time now. Poor River, has no clue until one day he comes home from work early only to walk in on his fiancé and her mistress banging IN HIS OWN BED. He was destroyed. His first ever love, cheating on him after everything they’ve been through. (It’s giving Ted Mosby vibes hopeless romantic) 

The sisters have their way at Jackie and call her every name in the book. River calls off the wedding and kick Jackie to the curb. That’s when Sage comes up with the idea of moving to a new town and starting a business. It’s the perfect fresh start they’ve all been in search of. Sages business (warm and fuzzy beanary) has something for all the siblings to do there. Make music, art, and coffee of course !!

 Now I’m stuck. What do I do now. I created a love interest for Sage, do I do the same for Rain? What about River, does he ever find love again? And what about the daughter, what do I do with her. I need ideas that aren’t boring and mondane. This is the first time I’m ever doing a generational thing because usually I get to bored because I’m not that creative with the storylines but I really love this little family and I want to keep the family going.

They say the camera never lies—but I say it flirts, teases, and sometimes tells just the right kind of fib. I’m the guy behind the lens, chasing beauty in all its messy, unexpected glory. I live for those in-between moments—the smirk before the laugh, the glance that says everything, the kind of light that makes skin glow like it’s telling secrets.

Outside the frame? I’m your classic Irish rogue—tattooed, music loud enough to shake the walls, book in hand (probably with a half-drunk coffee beside it), and always up for an adventure, especially the kind that starts with “I probably shouldn’t…” and ends with a story worth retelling.

I crave deep convos, cheeky chemistry, and the kind of connection that makes the world fade out like the end of a good film. If you’re a fellow dreamer, night owl, or someone who knows there’s beauty in being truly seen—then maybe we’re overdue for a little spark of something.

Oh, and I absolutely swap pics—cameras are my thing, remember?

I interned at a Delhi-based NGO where I built their new website for collecting general and corporate donations, as well as showcasing a gallery. A month in, things were going well. I also volunteered whenever they needed extra hands. One day, we had a corporate event with employees from a hospital group—though I don’t recall the exact name.

Me and four other guys were assigned to reach the event location by 6 AM, which we did. It was a tree plantation drive in a park, with employees from a corporate hospital expected to join at 10 AM. We gathered all the essentials—gardening tools, beverages, etc. While it wasn’t typical software dev work, I enjoyed it as it let me meet and interact with new people.

Later, our NGO’s manager and other seniors arrived and announced that two girls, Arpita and Ananya, were joining as new volunteers. At first, I didn’t pay much attention, but when our team lead formally introduced them, we greeted each other and got back to work. Eventually, I needed something Ananya had, so we started working together—interviewing participants, with me filming and her asking questions.

Out of curiosity—and maybe a bit of hormones—I asked Ananya what they were studying. She said they were psychology students from a Delhi college, doing NGO work as part of their coursework. That sounded cool, but instead of responding maturely, I cracked a joke: *""Nice, one of you must be putting people into depression and the other getting them out.""* To my surprise, Ananya laughed like a kid.

After wrapping up the interviews, we helped participants plant saplings. While doing that, I ran into Arpita. She struck up a conversation, asked about me, and we had a casual chat. I noticed she had a bit of a temper—she could be laughing one second and annoyed the next. It wasn't anything unusual though—pretty similar to other girls I’ve met. So, I didn’t think much of it.

Later, during a break, I was sitting with my team when I noticed Arpita looked upset—tears in her eyes. I asked her friend what happened, and she said Arpita was hurt by the joke I had made earlier. That hit me hard. I felt terrible and went to apologize, but she reacted angrily, like a kid throwing a tantrum. The whole team noticed and started asking *what I did*, not *what I said*, which made it even more embarrassing. I didn’t try again—I just went back to work.

From then on, Arpita and I were stuck in this silent war. She was handling something I needed, so we spoke only when necessary, but it felt empty. Inside, I felt awful—like I made someone uncomfortable without meaning to. I promised myself I wouldn’t let that happen again, especially not with her.

The event eventually ended on a good note, but I was still upset. On the way back to the office, a few people asked what happened, and all I could say was, “just a misunderstanding.” I mean, what was I supposed to say? “I made a bad joke”? Maybe I did.

After returning to the office and grabbing some coffee, we had another event lined up that same day—this time at a government school with a different corporate group. We rested for an hour and then the boys headed out early to set things up. The plan was to do wall paintings to help teach kids things like the alphabet and animals.

We did all the heavy lifting, and once the women and senior staff arrived, teams were formed. Our job was to draw outlines in classrooms, and the corporate folks would fill them in with colors—with our guidance. And guess who got paired with me? Arpita.

We were both awkward—barely making eye contact. I honestly felt like she was staring at me with the intensity of someone who wanted to *murder* me. We split the wall and got to work in silence. Eventually, the corporate volunteers joined us, and as they painted (and messed up), we couldn’t help but laugh—though we still weren’t really talking.

Then, out of nowhere, she asked, *“Are you ignoring me?”* I was stunned.

I said, *“Ma’am, you got upset over my joke, so I figured I should keep my distance to avoid more issues.”*  
She replied, *“What issues?”*

I told her, *“That scene in the park—now half the team probably thinks I’m some kind of creep.”*  
She laughed, but I was serious. That’s when she apologized and admitted she was sensitive and didn’t realize it was just a joke. We cleared the air, and after that, we started talking—a lot. Music, family, college—everything.

At one point, I said, *“Kaash paani mil jaata,”* because we weren’t allowed to leave the class. Next thing I know, she comes back with a water bottle—one she apparently *snatched* from someone else’s hand just to get it for me.

We became friends, and I even asked Arpita if she could start coming to the office daily. But she told me she was only allowed to join during events, not on regular office days. Jokingly, she replied, “Oh, someone wants to see me every day.” I don’t know what it was about that moment, but I’d never seen her that happy—she was glowing.

The next day, I fell sick and couldn’t make it to the office, but she came. The day after, I was still unwell, and she came again. Then, when I finally returned, she didn’t show up. After about a week, we crossed paths again—but this time, there was silence between us. A deep, awkward silence.

Later that day, while leaving, my friend and I were headed to the metro after completing our office work. he asked if Arpita and her friend wanted to come along, and they did. Ananya and my teammate chatted the whole way, while Arpita and I walked in silence, the awkwardness settling in again.

But during a metro interchange, Ananya suddenly asked, “Why aren’t you two talking?” I replied, “She’s not saying anything,” to which Arpita shot back, “Well, *you* could say something too.” That broke the ice, and we started talking again. Turns out, she had no idea I was sick—she thought I was skipping office just to avoid her. Like, seriously? As if I’d waste my own money for that.

Later, my teammate asked Ananya for her contact since he was helping her source items—like pots—for the next event. She shared it, and we all left. The next day, which was a Sunday, my friend went to check out those items and sent pictures in the group. But the girls replied, “Looks good in pictures, but how do we know what it’s like in real life?” They asked us to buy and bring everything to the office, to which my friend jokingly replied, “Itna paisa nahi hai papa ke paas mere.”

So we all agreed that the girls would come to the market themselves. They did—but when they asked the team lead for funds on call, he told them to drop the plan altogether. Since they’d come all the way, I suggested we go out somewhere instead. They agreed, and we ended up going to Hauz Khas for the sunset—Arpita’s idea.

We sat on a bench—me, Arpita, Ananya, and my friend—and ended up talking about life, dreams, random things. It felt easy, light. And honestly, I’d never seen a girl look as happy as Arpita did that evening. She was like a kid—carefree, smiling, glowing.

Then out of nowhere, she brought up a girl from our office. She had seen a photo in that girl’s Instagram highlight—just a guy’s hand—but it apparently looked like mine. Combine that with the fact that she’d seen me talking and laughing with her... and boom, she started questioning me. I realized she had been lowkey stalking a bit.

Was she jealous? I still don’t know. 

one thing i always thought is that love or friendship everything asks money as you can't just love someone or you can, but you can't show your love especially in this age group that we are in , and I didn't had money  that so I had a mindset of making money and then falling for someone or getting into a relation as I can't spend my dad's hard earned money on my fun , well I was thinking way ahead we were just friends but I already have thought my marriage and all.

One day during an event, Arpita brought some of her college friends along as volunteers. I was leading the team that day, and one of her friends ended up sticking by my side the entire time—helping me out, talking to me constantly. It was pretty clear she had a thing for me. But what I didn’t expect was Arpita’s reaction. She got upset. Quiet, distant. And that’s when it really hit me—maybe she liked me too. Or at least, I hoped she did.

Days passed. We started meeting on weekends, exploring Delhi together—markets, temples, random little places. I kept telling myself not to fall for her. I *tried* to stay distant, to not get attached. But how could I not? Especially after January came around and she handed me a handwritten letter—three full pages, filled with words about how grateful she was to have me in her life. There were little doodles all over it. That letter? It hit me hard. Who wouldn’t fall after that?

But still, I held back. I never really opened up about my personal life, my struggles. She came from a rich family—I didn't think she'd ever understand the kind of things I was dealing with. I didn’t want to weigh her down with all that.

after the letter thing, somewhere along the way, I started to let her in. Slowly, I began sharing my world—my family, my issues, the real me. And ironically, that’s when she started pulling away.

By February, something had changed. I told her how I truly felt, thinking maybe this was finally *our* moment. But on February 14—the last time I saw her—we had a fight. She had become so comfortable around me that she stopped seeing the line between fun and disrespect. She crossed it, and I couldn't ignore it.

When I confessed my feelings, she just said, *“I already told you about my past… I can’t take another chance. I’m sorry.”*

And just like that, reality hit me like a brick wall—I was just a rebound. A temporary comfort. A distraction.

So I did the only thing I could to protect whatever was left of me—I blocked her from everywhere.  
  
After she left, I had two choices to move on: stay busy or start drinking again. This time, I chose to stay busy. I buried myself in React and deep JavaScript concepts—coding for 8 to 9 hours straight every night. Her leaving had left me sleepless, anyways in some strange way, those sleepless nights turned out to be my most productive ones.

Still, I can't lie—those three months I spent with her were probably the best of my life. We went out 25 times—she used to call them “outings,” not “dates,” but honestly, they felt like dates to me. I still have her letter and I read it sometimes. But we can't put feelings in someone's heart.

From February to May, I was in full grind mode. That’s also when AI started blowing up—ChatGPT had just come into the picture. At the same time, I was looking for internships again. My parents were starting to ask for support, not directly, but I could feel it. And I knew I needed a distraction—something to pour myself into.

I went all in. Applied to over 300 internships on Internshala. Completed 20+ assignments. And eventually, I landed an internship at an AI-based SaaS startup that built custom platforms for clients. It was remote and paid ₹15k/month. The founder was an IITian, and working under him was both overwhelming and exciting.

Those 7 months turned out to be both the best and worst of my life. Best—because I was learning and building like crazy. Worst—because that’s when I got introduced to Reddit and some mental health spirals. But the growth? Unmatched.

In the final two months, the founder asked me to join offline in Gurgaon to work directly with another startup we were consulting for. That company had a massive codebase—24 repositories—and I got to integrate AI features into real, production-grade systems. It was intense, but it felt *cool*. Very cool.

I met four new devs during my time there—fun guys, easy to vibe with. We got close quickly, and I slipped back into drinking again. We'd pull all-nighters—sometimes working, sometimes just talking over drinks. It felt like I was growing, learning, making progress. For a while, I really believed I’d land a PPO from the company.

But that didn’t happen.

I don’t know why. Maybe because I was only in my 5th semester. Maybe because I’m from BCA. Whatever the reason, it didn’t work out. When I left, I was nearing the end of my 5th semester, and the anxiety hit hard. I had no job, and I hadn’t prepared seriously for NIMCET either.

By January, I was trying to focus on studying, but then came another shock: those friends I made at that client company—the devs I worked and drank with—they called and told me they had all been fired. Every single one of them. A whole team of five developers, including an IITian, let go from the startup.

That shook me.

I was already anxious, but that news terrified me even more. Still, I picked up my NIMCET prep with whatever focus I could gather. But my destiny had other plans.

What I didn’t mention earlier is that my life had already started shifting back in my 3rd semester.

While I was interning at the NGO, I had my semester exams. Due to financial issues at home, my fees weren’t paid, and the college didn’t allow me to sit for the last exam. I gave three out of four, convincing the invigilator each time that the fee would be cleared “tomorrow.” But eventually, they stopped allowing it, and I ended up with a backlog—just one subject: English.

I assumed I’d clear it in the 5th semester. But during that time, I was interning at an AI-based startup and completely missed the notification to fill out the reappear form. Another chance, gone. I thought maybe in the final semester I’d get one more shot, but when the forms came out in January, I realized they were only for even semesters—and my backlog was from an odd semester. That’s when it hit me: I wasn’t going to be able to clear it.

My hopes for MCA started fading too. I hadn’t prepared properly for NIMCET, and though the exam dates weren’t out yet, CUET-PG dates were. So I shifted my focus there. Honestly, my preparation wasn’t great. I didn’t give it my all—just went through the motions.

CUET happened in March. After that, April was mostly a pause—some light coding, some job applications. Around April 20th, I got a call from a Gurgaon-based startup for a backend intern role. Gave the interview, built a Postman clone for the assignment, and got selected.

Now I’m working again as an intern—earning ₹20k/month. No pressure about MCA anymore. I’ll try again next year. If things go well, the company will offer me a full-time role at ₹8.5 LPA CTC (\~₹6L in-hand). Even if they don’t, I’m confident I’ll find something. My skills will back me up.

Over the past year, I’ve been anxious—like most of us. *What if this doesn’t work? What if that falls apart?* But I kept going. Or maybe, I just kept flowing with whatever came next.

I don’t believe in God—I’m an atheist. But I believe in life. This journey. I’ve realized not everyone has to win big, not everyone has to be the best. You don’t need to achieve everything. Just live, keep moving, and enjoy what you can.

Stay average. Not all winners succeed. Not all average ones fail.

## Key Features Analysis

The efficacy of a fluoride water filter hinges on several critical factors. These features dictate its ability to remove fluoride and other contaminants, while also influencing filter lifespan, water flow, and ease of use.

**Fluoride Removal Technology:** Different water filters employ varied technologies for fluoride removal, including activated alumina, reverse osmosis, and bone char carbon. Activated alumina is a popular choice, known for its affordability and effectiveness in adsorbing fluoride ions. Reverse osmosis (RO) systems, while more expensive, offer superior filtration by pushing water thru a semi-permeable membrane, effectively removing a wide range of contaminants, including fluoride. Bone char carbon, a more traditional method, involves activated carbon derived from animal bones, providing another effective filtration option.

The choice between these technologies depends on your budget, water quality concerns, and desired level of filtration. RO systems provide the most comprehensive filtration but require more space and may produce wastewater. Activated alumina offers a good balance of cost and effectiveness, while bone char carbon is a natural and sustainable option.

**Filter capacity and Lifespan:** The capacity of a fluoride water filter refers to the amount of water it can effectively filter before needing replacement. Filter lifespan, on the other hand, indicates how long the filter will last under normal usage conditions. These two factors are interconnected and determine the overall cost-effectiveness of the filter.

Filters with higher capacities and longer lifespans generally require less frequent replacement, reducing maintenance costs and hassle. The lifespan can vary substantially depending on the water quality, with heavily contaminated water shortening the filter's effective life. Many filters indicate when replacement is needed through flow rate reduction or visual indicators.

**Water Flow Rate:** The water flow rate measures how quickly filtered water can be dispensed. A higher flow rate means you can fill glasses and pitchers faster. This is particularly crucial for households with high water consumption.

Lower flow rates can be frustrating, especially when filling large containers for cooking or drinking. It’s essential to consider the flow rate specifications of a filter and compare it to your daily water needs.Some advanced filters incorporate features to maintain a consistent flow rate as the filter media ages.**System Installation and Maintenance:** The ease of installation and ongoing maintenance is another important aspect to consider. Some filters are designed for simple DIY installation, while others may require professional plumbing.

Maintenance typically involves regular filter replacement, which can range from every few months to once a year. Systems with readily accessible filters and clear replacement instructions are generally preferred. Some filters also have self-cleaning functions that help to extend their lifespan.

**Certifications and Standards:** Certifications from reputable organizations like NSF international provide assurance that the filter meets specific performance standards. These certifications verify that the filter effectively reduces contaminants and meets safety requirements concerning materials and construction.

Filters certified to NSF/ANSI Standard 53 specifically address health effects, while certifications for Standard 42 focus on aesthetic effects like taste and odor. Look for filters that meet or exceed the relevant NSF standards to ensure the water you are drinking is safe and clean.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a fluoride water filter offers several compelling benefits for your health, convenience, and peace of mind. It's about more than just removing fluoride; it's about improving overall water quality.

**Enhanced Water Purity:** Fluoride filters effectively remove or reduce fluoride levels, providing cleaner and healthier drinking water. While public water systems add fluoride to prevent tooth decay, some individuals prefer to avoid it due to concerns about potential health effects. A fluoride water filter removes this additive, offering pure and refreshing water on demand.

This is especially beneficial for families with young children, who may be more susceptible to the effects of excessive fluoride intake.Knowing that your drinking water is free of added fluoride can provide greater peace of mind.

**Improved Taste and Odor:** in addition to fluoride, many water filters also remove other contaminants that can affect the taste and odor of tap water. Chlorine, sediment, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are common culprits. By eliminating these impurities,the water filter enhances the flavor and aroma of your water,making it more enjoyable to drink.

Filtered water is ideal for brewing coffee and tea, as it allows the natural flavors of these beverages to shine through without interference from unwanted chemicals. It can also improve the taste of cooked foods, as water is essential for many recipes.

**Healthier Water Composition:** Premium water filters remove a broad range of contaminants, including lead, arsenic, and pesticides. By reducing these harmful substances, the filter enhances the overall healthfulness of your water supply. This provides significant health benefits, particularly for vulnerable populations like pregnant women, infants, and the elderly.

Access to clean and safe drinking water is essential for maintaining optimum health and well-being. A quality water filter can alleviate concerns about the potential health risks associated with contaminated tap water.

I believe this must be largely due to differences in skin chemistry/my nose's interpretation of notes, because this is clearly a high quality house! I'm just not smelling what everyone else is.

Two versions of **Falling Stars** *(black coffee, almond cream, sandalwood, natural oud, palo santo oil, tonka bean absolute, vanilla bean)* smelled predominantly like playdough. I didn't get spice or tobacco from **Fuckery** *(luxardo cherry, caramelized sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, sandalwood, tobacco absolute, smoke, night air, clean sheets)* and just got sugary cherry. **Cake For Breakfast** *(birthday cake, ripe mango, pineapple, coffee, maple syrup, and a hint of cardamom)* smelled like spicy maple syrup. **Your Girlfriend Is A Badass** *(yellow cake, fudge icing, oakmoss, cedar, forest floor)* was sharp and soapy.

In a horrific turn of events, I enjoyed **Something Wicked** *(vanilla, patchouli, sandalwood, whiskey)* but could only smell it for a few minutes, and only if I practically pressed my nose into my skin. I almost liked **2 AM In Lafayette** *(vanilla c02, oakmoss, cafe au lait, caramel, beignets, powdered sugar)*! It's dark, rich, sweet, warm, and there's a delightful element that's sort of bready and almost savory. But it's a little too sugary for me.

Yesterday, I received a sample of **Mermaids Sing Of Lost Lovers** *(grenadine, heady jasmine absolute, ylang ylang, white chocolate, caramel, ambergris)* from the Sunday Swaps. I wasn't expecting much considering my long history of Sorce failures, and hearing a couple people say this smelled plasticky and weird to them. But my silly, financially irresponsible determination to find a Sorce scent I enjoy finally paid off! (I never know when to quit and get easily lured in by good reviews despite repeated failures)

My first impression is that it's sweet, warm, and almost salty? Vaguely fruity. Florals emerge but they're gentle and sweet, not sharp or stinky. I wouldn't have guessed there's caramel or chocolate notes in this, and it's not sugary or cloying. After about half an hour, I believe the more noticeable musky/humid/salty quality must be ambergris. The fragrance also gains a toasted, caramelized quality over time. This is a gorgeous, warm, sweet and salty, beachy masterpiece.

This ongoing push at the $106k level feels a lot like a dance-off where the bulls struggle to break free, extending a frustrating pattern that has lasted for months. 

The weekend’s buzz was fueled by Moody’s historic downgrade of the U.S. credit rating to Aa1. This stirred the waters, giving Bitcoin a slight bump of nearly 2% before the buyers took a coffee break. Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act made waves on Capitol Hill, with its advancement signaling a potential transformation in U.S. digital asset regulations, something Bitcoin seemed to appreciate as it reacted favorably.

In the last week alone, crypto spot exchange-traded funds enjoyed a hearty feast, absorbing a whopping $7.5 billion in net inflows. Impressively, BlackRock’s IBIT now commands 633,212.00 $BTC, which is about 3% of the total supply. Talk about making a statement!

Market analyst Edul Patel shares a spicy tidbit: a daily close above $107,500 could unleash a rally toward new all-time highs. Alternatively, slipping back to support around $102,750 could send Bitcoin on a quick detour toward an ominous $100,000. 

As mixed macro signals play out, inflation seems to cool a bit, yet Treasury yields hold their ground, keeping the bulls on their toes. Bitcoin’s dance with traditional finance remains unpredictable, but its safe-haven appeal shines bright when the financial seas get rough.

With volatility resting at all-time lows, the upcoming May 30 options expiry could rev things up. If Bitcoin breaks above $107,500, expect option writers to scramble for hedges, potentially sending prices soaring toward January’s peak. On a side note, JPMorgan has opened its doors for wealth clients to buy Bitcoin directly, reinforcing the narrative that institutional interest is far from gone.

The coming days will be crucial. Can Bitcoin turn this $106,000 wall into a floor? Only time will tell, but the market is certainly watching closely.

# Chapter 1

Hayden Griffin's lover threw another tantrum.

He handed me the divorce agreement.

""Signed it, just for show, to please the little girl.""

I tightly held the hem of my dress, nodded, and quietly signed my name.

When he left, he heard his friends joking.

""Is it possible that you asked your sister-in-law to get the certificate, and she did it without saying a word?""

Hayden happily lit a cigarette.

""Want to make a bet?""

They bet that, one month later at the courthouse, I would cry like a dog and behave obediently.

Changed the marriage certificate to a divorce certificate.

I held the phone and remained silent.

Just replied to the message that was just sent.

“Can you just marry me, okay?”

""Okay.""

\*\*\*

""?""

They replied almost instantly.

I turned off my phone.

The laughter inside continued.

That's great! My sister-in-law is so obedient, I'll treat everyone to drinks next month!

""Three months,"" Hayden said.

""Ok, Okay!""

A burst of laughter.

I hurriedly walked out.

Until I walked out of the office building, the sharp sunlight pierced into my eyes.

Tears fell down slowly.

Hayden had a crush on an unfinished girl.

Bought her a house in Rivershore, filled with luxury items.

The little girl wouldn't let him kiss her or hold her.

She lived in a 360-square-meter apartment, wearing designer clothes worth hundreds of thousands. She said with a stiff neck, ""I won't be a mistress!""

Hayden found it extremely interesting.

At present, it was already Hayden's third time acting for her.

The first time, he showed affection with me.

At that time, I didn't know about the existence of Brielle Fuentes.

He happily hugged him and took many photos.

Seeing his full screen of nine-grid, he was both surprised and excited.

That Instagram account, no matter how much I refresh, I can't see it.

Later, I found out that he had set it to ""Only visible to Brielle.""

The second time, he argued with me.

They left me on the street.

Took a picture of me crying alone and sent it to Brielle.

""Look, there's no way around it, she couldn't leave me.""

The third time, he wanted to divorce me.

The phone buzzed, and I took it out.

""Really?""

""Are you serious?""

Karissa Mullins.

I wiped away my tears and smiled.

""Really.""

In the afternoon, Hayden did take me to the courthouse.

He was in a good mood all the way.

Kept asking me where to go for our three-year anniversary.

Hayden and I grew up together since we were young, and this is our third year of marriage.

How was Monaville?

""You were only 7 years old when you insisted on going to Monaville Plaza to feed the pigeons.""

He got off the car, opened the door, and unbuckled my seatbelt.

""Tsk, why did you cry again?""

He frowned and brushed his fingertips across the corner of my eye.

""I told you all to just pretend, like a little sparrow, I was just curious when she would bow her head.""

In the midst of speaking, something fell out of the pocket.

A box of condoms.

Hayden coughed lightly and touched his nose.

No explanation.

Took me into the courthouse.

Everything went smoothly.

I had aphasia.

Often unable to speak when facing strangers.

But I could nod or shake my head.

""Was it a voluntary divorce?""

""Yes.""

I nodded.

""Confirmed the emotional breakdown?""

""Yes.""

I nodded.

""A month of cooling-off period, come back in a month.""

Hayden took the receipt.

Took a photo without leaving the courthouse, lowered the head to send a message.

My information followed suit.

As before, Brielle's.

Hayden sent her a photo of the receipt, with the added sentence: ""Are you satisfied? Clean it for me tonight!""

Click on the profile picture, block.

Just finished operating, received a text message confirming the ticket has been issued.

WhatsApp: ""Flight tickets purchased, one month later.""

""Galwiea saw.""

# Chapter 2

I still dreamt of Hayden at night.

When Hayden was young, he had a sweet tooth.

Karissa, your eyes are really beautiful, can I look at them often and talk to you?

""Karissa, you played the piano so beautifully. Can I come and listen to your performances every day?""

""Karissa, I liked you the most! Growing up, I wanted to marry you!""

I also liked Hayden.

We used to sit together at school.

After school, we gathered together to play.

Even when my parents had a car accident, I was in their car.

Played rock-paper-scissors with him.

The two cars were too close.

I saw the truck crossing in front of me.

Boom—

My father, my mother, my brother, and even my little dog that I raised since childhood, were all struggling in the fire.

For a long time, my voice couldn't make any sound.

I needed Hayden to be with me in order to fall asleep.

Hayden was very patient at that time.

Practice vocalization with me.

Tell me stories all night long.

Whoever dared to mock me as a ""mute"", he punched me right away.

I married him as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

The day after he received his college diploma, he crawled to the head of my bed early in the morning.

""Karissa, let's get married again.""

That day, we became husband and wife.

In the dream, there was a fiery red rose, covering our new house.

He knelt on the bed and kissed me very gently.

He said, ""Karissa, we were so happy all our lives.""

With eyes open, the whole world was black.

I took out my phone, and Brielle had sent another text.

A photo.

On a messy bed, a splash of crimson.

Suddenly felt nauseous.

I rushed into the bathroom and retched for a while.

But it was only vomited out physiological tears.

Finally sat on the cold ground, hugging my legs.

I don't know where I touched my phone, in the silent night, suddenly a deep male voice sounded: ""Karissa?""

My heart skipped a beat.

Pick up the phone.

""Jayvon Salinas?""

Jayvon was my fellow patient.

After three years of intervention in the hospital, my aphasia improved significantly.

Only when feeling down or anxious, could not speak.

During the two years I was married to Hayden, I even almost recovered.

Feeling good, and free again.

I joined a support group for patients.

The recipient of the assistance assigned was Jayvon.

Actually, for the past two years, I always thought he was a girl.

The profile picture of a pink rabbit, WhatsApp name ""Angel"".

At first, ""she"" almost completely ignored me.

But like understands like.

People who are constantly troubled by aphasia often have severe psychological trauma.

They may not have been able to speak.

But it needed someone to accompany.

I tirelessly shared my daily life with ""her"".

From text to speech.

From photos to videos.

At the end of the sharing, it felt like old friends who had known each other for many years.

When I first spoke to ""her"" and found out that ""she"" was actually a man, I was so scared that I almost had a heart attack.

""I'm sorry.""

I held my phone, ""Excuse me... Are you resting?""

""No,"" Jayvon said, ""It was nine o'clock here at night.""

He spoke so fluently.

This was the second time I talked to him.

After I found out he was male, I deliberately kept my distance from him.

That day was actually purely accidental.

I haven't contacted him for almost a month.

It was so coincidental that when Hayden handed me the divorce agreement, he asked me what I was doing.

My mind was blanked by the words ""divorce agreement"".

Divorced.

After signing the document, I hid outside Hayden's office, trembling all over.

""Jayvon, I feel like I had no home.""

No dad, no mom, no brother, no my lovely little dog.

Even Hayden was gone.

What to do?

I didn't expect him to suddenly say, ""Then marry me, can't you?""

The laughter in the room grew louder and louder.

""Come on, Karissa divorced Hayden, she couldn't even speak, how could she possibly get a divorce certificate.""

Yes, really asking her to get a divorce, afraid it will make the courthouse collapse in tears!

""Is that so?""

Hayden sneered.

Lighter thrown onto the coffee table: ""She may cry like a dog, but she will always be my Hayden's dog.""

""I wanted her to go east, and she would crawl to the east even if she had to crawl!""

I stared absentmindedly at the stranger who had already appeared in the crack of the door.

""Okay.""

# Chapter 3

Jayvon gave me a list.

Things to be done within a month.

Applying for visas and hiring lawyers, needless to say, are essential.

Inside, there were densely packed must-eat restaurants listed.

""The foreign food was not tasty.""

""Really.""

I accepted willingly.

Following his list, we ate one by one.

The days of a person, it seemed, were not so difficult either.

Every day, eat, buy, and then pack the luggage.

On the day we moved out of the divorce house, Hayden suddenly messaged me.

""Didn't anyone call me? Didn't they miss me?""

He took Brielle on a trip.

Tell the little girl to see the world.

Not obedient.

He sent again.

Then I sent a photo.

This place is nice, the third anniversary, shall I bring you here as well?

I really wanted to block Brielle, just block her directly.

But thinking about going to the courthouse to get the divorce certificate, I decided against it.

Over the next half month, I dealt with the small pieces of jewelry and handbags on hand.

Went to the hospital for a physical examination.

Confirmed not pregnant.

Finally, I sorted out all the assets that Hayden had entrusted to me for safekeeping.

The night before going to the courthouse, Hayden came back.

He called me.

""Karissa, did you move away?""

He got used to my silence on the phone and laughed to himself.

Karissa, you are too cute.

""I told you it was just a scene.""

""That's it,"" he was in a very good mood.

""Why not go all the way and tomorrow you come with me to the courthouse and get the divorce certificate?""

I held the phone.

""Karissa, don't worry, it's just...""

""Okay,"" I said.

""Wow\~\~\~""

There was a commotion over there.

I hung up the phone.

Sent him the time via WhatsApp.

The next day, I got up early.

Hayden arrived late.

It was probably intentional by Brielle, a not too deep nor shallow tooth mark at the corner of his lips.

He didn't.

I pretended not to see it.

The procedure went even smoother than last time.

Just five minutes apart.

""Karissa, I will give you a surprise tomorrow.""

Hayden lightly kicked my shin.

I put away the divorce certificate: ""Hayden, are you free tonight?""

I looked at him and said, ""There are some things I want to tell you.""

Hayden was startled.

Since we got married, I have always called him ""husband"".

In the next moment, he raised his peach blossom eyes and flicked the red book in his hand.

Done.

# Chapter 4

No matter how Hayden was this year.

I didn't want to deny the past Hayden.

I thanked him for so many years of companionship and appreciated his care for me.

So actually, I never thought about leaving without saying anything.

But it rained that night.

Thunder roared and lightning flashed.

I was afraid of nights like this.

The accident happened in such a heavy rainstorm.

I endured the tremble in my body, waiting for Hayden.

I was even worried that when Hayden appeared, I would shatter the psychological defense line that I had built up with great difficulty over the past month due to years of habit, and throw myself into his arms and cry.

But he didn't come.

He called me.

When the phone was answered, there was a lot of noise on the other end.

What redemption! Bullshit!

""I annoyed her so much during those years! If it wasn't for my mom pushing me, I wouldn't have bothered with her!""

""Marriage? Can you guess why they got married so early?""

""It was just because she didn't let me touch it!""

""I was just curious, wasn't she supposed to have a speech disorder when she gets too excited? What about in bed? Can she make any sound? Hahaha.""

Rumble-

It seemed like something was torn apart again in such a thunderstorm day.

I wanted to hide.

I didn't want anyone to see me in an embarrassing state.

Where could you hide?

No matter where, there was rain and thunder everywhere.

Mockery was everywhere.

Jayvon's phone rang at that moment.

""Karissa?""

His voice was always calm.

Let those noisy voices seem to instantly fade away.

Were you crying?

I wanted to say no.

But I couldn't make a sound.

Tears seemed to respond to his words, bursting out like a broken dam.

""You wait.""

He remained calm, ""I'll come pick you up.""

Hayden is single again.

A group of playboys organized a ""singles party"", drank heavily at the KTV, passed out in a row.

I don't know what time it was, someone groggily reached for their phone.

""Wow! Big news!""

With a shout, it woke up a few.

""The esteemed leader of the Salinas Group, unexpectedly appeared in Rivershore!""

""It was still the private plane that rushed back overnight!""

There was a confused person waving their hand.

Impossible. Wasn't he said to be recuperating abroad? Haven't seen anyone in ten years.

""Really! It's all trending!""

Phone passed.

The cold scene became lively again.

""It was really him! He was actually hugging a girl! He said he came back overnight to take the girl abroad!""

""Wow, the PR didn't even have time to do it. How urgent is this?""

""I looked and looked!""

""Wow, this girl... why does she look so familiar...""

""Hayden, Hayden!""

Someone pushed Hayden and said, ""Look at this in Jayvon's arms, does it look like... his sister-in-law?""

Hayden actually woke up early.

But he didn't like to watch the hustle and bustle of the Salinas family.

""How could it be your sister-in-law?""

He reluctantly took the phone, ""Your sister-in-law doesn't even dare to go out to Rivershore, let alone go abroad...""

Just glanced at the photo and suddenly froze.

The airport was pouring with heavy rain.

Under the black umbrella, the man had a tall figure and a stern face.

He protected the girl in his arms without revealing a single trace.

But he was too familiar with Karissa.

Her figure, her hair color...

Impossible.

Hayden threw down the phone.

How could Karissa possibly know someone like Jayvon?

Tonight she invited him to her apartment.

It's been about a month since I last saw him, and I miss him so much.

Hayden took out a cigarette from the cigarette case.

Lit.

Take out your own phone.

Flipping through, I found Karissa's phone and was about to dial.

Check the time on the phone.

Three in the morning.

Forget it, at this time, she was sleeping.

However.

No matter when, Karissa would always answer his phone.

Hayden lit up his phone again.

Dial.

I'm sorry, the number you have dialed is not in service.

# Chapter 5

After that car accident, I have never left Rivershore.

All means of transportation made me feel fearful.

Going to a completely unfamiliar place makes me even more uneasy.

I sat next to Jayvon, nervously clutching my hands.

He was very tall.

Even sitting in the back seat, he still towered over me by a head.

He looked very serious.

The driver spoke to him, and he simply replied with a few words.

He seemed like a remarkable celebrity.

Just now at Rivershore Airport, the reporters swarmed around us.

They shouted ""Mr. Salinas"" one after another.

Was I... impulsive?

I didn't know the name ""Jayvon"" until I spoke to him for the first time.

Galwiea, the city, was a place that I never even dared to imagine before.

The person next to me suddenly moved.

Take out whatever from your pocket and hand it to me.

Did you eat?

One candy.

There was a pink bunny printed on the paper bag.

My memory was immediately pulled back two years ago, and I tirelessly talked to ""her"".

Angela, do you love eating candies?

""I recently ate a candy, it was so delicious!""

""Juicy and soft, emitting the fragrant scent of peaches!""

""If you want to eat it, give me an address and I will send you a can?""

She replied with a string of addresses.

That was the first time ""she"" paid attention to me.

The feeling of unfamiliarity was suddenly dispelled.

This rabbit candy, I searched for a long time back then.

Found it by looking at his WhatsApp profile picture.

Just wanted to make this introverted ""Angela"" happy.

""Did I peel it for you?""

He didn't seem so difficult to get close to.

The voice was gentle, with a soft light shining in the eyes.

Without waiting for my nod, he had already skillfully unwrapped the candy wrapper.

I took the candy and put it in my mouth.

The familiar taste spread from the tip of the tongue.

All the pores on the body relaxed.

I actually stayed in a completely unfamiliar place.

Jayvon arranged for me to stay at his apartment.

But he seemed busy and rarely came home.

In the first week after adjusting to the time difference, he had a conversation with me.

""Karissa, what job did you want to do?""

You stunned me with that question.

Hayden didn't allow me to go out to work.

""You were so nervous that you couldn't even speak clearly. What kind of work could you do?""

Good, just stay at home planting flowers and taking care of plants, what's missing without your little bit?

Jayvon was holding a cup of coffee.

""Your language learning had not started yet, but there were many people from our country here.""

I clenched my fists.

""Can I...?""

Jayvon raised his eyebrows and said, ""How would you know if you don't try?""

Then I actually found a job.

Teach a child my mother tongue.

It was just an ordinary ""tutoring"" session, but I was unexpectedly happy.

I was so happy that I wanted to share it with a few close friends. It seems like I'm not that useless after all.

Just logged into WhatsApp, messages came pouring in like snowflakes.

""Karissa, where did you go? Mr. Griffin has been looking for you like crazy!""

On the 10th of next month, I got married. You come and try to steal the bride.

Upon hearing this, Beckett Zeller finally lifted his head and glanced at Katrina Wilson, who was sitting across from him, with a slight surprise flickering in his slightly raised eyes.

The bony hand with distinct knuckles lightly tapped on the table, carrying an indescribable and inexplicable meaning in its tone.

""Married without consent? Do you know what your identity is and what my identity is?""

In the face of his questioning, Katrina remained calm and composed, her tone unruffled.

""Of course, I was Jamir Lancaster's fiancée, and you were his archenemy.""

""You just needed to tell me, are you coming or not?""

Seeing her speak so calmly, Beckett's lips curled into a slight smile.

He leaned back on the chair, reverting to the relaxed posture he had when he first sat down.

""Come, what are the benefits?""

I heard that your grandmother's health wasn't very good and she has been urging you to get married. You coming to propose not only can embarrass the Lancaster family, but also fulfill your family's expectations. It's a win-win situation.

When talking about this, Katrina still had no expression and spoke casually, as if discussing today's weather.

Seeing her indifferent attitude, Beckett became even more interested.

He raised his right hand and reached out towards her.

""Deal.""

Two hands lightly clasped in the air.

The contract was finalized, and Katrina stood up decisively to leave.

Beckett raised his hand and examined it closely for a while in front of his eyes, then called her.

""Everyone in the circle knows that Jamir loved you to the core, considered you his life. If you eloped with me at the wedding, would he go crazy on the spot?""

Katrina did not answer him.

Her footsteps paused for a moment, and then she left without hesitation.

Passing by the square, a interview was being played on the central screen.

On the screen, Jamir, wearing gold-rimmed glasses and a suit, appeared, instantly attracting the attention of all the girls in the square.

Katrina also stopped in her tracks, listening carefully to the familiar sound that reached her ears.

Host: ""Mr. Jamir, why did you hastily acquire the brand Floralmuse?""

Jamir: ""Because a few days ago, I just proposed to my girlfriend and I need a professional floral team to take care of the wedding venue decoration.""

Host: ""...""

Host: ""It is said that the Lancaster Group recently acquired dozens of snack factories. What does this have to do with the Lancaster Group's future strategy?""

Jamir: ""No, I bought them purely because they were my future wife's favorite snacks.""

Host: ""...""

In a less than ten-minute interview, no matter what the host asked, he never strayed from talking about marriage, never strayed from talking about his wife. Listening to him, everyone couldn't help but feel moved. Jamir, the president of the Lancaster Group, such a powerful figure in the business world, turned out to be a romantic at heart.

It started drizzling lightly from the sky, and after listening for two minutes, Katrina silently turned around and walked into the nearest store.

Just as she entered the door, the phone rang and she picked it up to hear Jamir's gentle and doting voice.

""Katrina, the servant said you went out? It's raining outside now, where are you? I'll come to pick you up.""

She slightly clenched her phone and after a while, she said, ""Don't you have an important meeting today? You're busy, I'll just take a taxi by myself.""

There was no hesitation on the phone, and his voice came through again.

""No, nothing is important without you. Send me the address, I will come over right now.""

Katrina did not refuse anymore.

After the phone call ended, she had just sent the address when two new message notifications appeared on the screen.

A few days ago, she hired a private detective and received the latest update.

""Mr. Jamir didn't go to the company today. He went to the hospital to accompany a woman for prenatal check-up. He has just come out of the hospital.""

Underneath the message, there is a high-definition photo.

In the photo, Jamir was helping a woman push open a door with the words ""Obstetrics and Gynecology"" written on it.

Several girls on the side were still discussing how happy it was to marry Jamir, fearing that they would be spoiled to the heavens.

Katrina listened and looked at the people in the photo, a sarcastic smile appearing at the corner of her mouth.

She and Jamir knew each other since childhood and grew up together as childhood sweethearts.

At the age when other boys were mischievous and teasing girls, Jamir became her guardian, not allowing any opposite sex to approach her.

From the innocence of childhood to the awakening of teenage love, he was always by her side, giving her whatever she wanted, as if he could pluck the stars from the sky and give them to her.

She was curious to learn how to ride a bicycle, but accidentally fell and scraped her skin. He was extremely worried and since then, he didn't let her use any means of transportation and personally picked her up and dropped her off wherever she went.

Katrina also thought that she would always be the only one in his heart.

Until a sudden invitation came, she cancelled the prearranged date with Jamir for work and went abroad for a performance.

A week later, she returned to her home country, only to find that everything had changed.

On the night she left, Jamir had been planning to propose to her.

The meticulously prepared grand proposal scene did not wait for the hostess. He was heartbroken and got drunk, mistakenly entering the wrong room in the hotel, and spent a night with a colleague from the company, Mariela Sullivan.

Two months later, the news of Mariela's pregnancy spread unexpectedly, alarming Jamir's grandmother, Valeria Lancaster.

Valeria forced him to save this child by threatening to die.

It was said that Katrina was obsessed with her dance career and was unwilling to have children. Jamir was advised to leave some bloodline for the Lancaster family.

Jamir was filial and didn't want to hurt Valeria's feelings, so he had to make an agreement with Mariela.

He exchanged a large sum of money and demanded that Mariela leave after giving birth to this child.

Later, after Katrina returned to her home country, he couldn't wait and proposed to her again.

He thought that as long as he did this, everything would be able to return to the way it was before. He thought that he had handled it without anyone knowing.

But little did he know that his beloved Katrina had already found out everything.

She couldn't accept betrayal, nor could she accept flaws.

So, she decided to completely cut off the relationship of over a decade and planned to run away from the wedding a month later, leaving him for good!

# Chapter 2

""Katrina, were you hungry after waiting for so long? I prepared some snacks and coffee, would you like to have a little something to eat first?""

The person who suddenly appeared in front of the glass window interrupted Katrina's thoughts.

She shook her head and walked over to him.

Jamir reached out and took her hand. She instinctively looked down and immediately noticed the stain on his coat, which she didn't know when it had gotten there.

His gaze followed her as she moved, seeing her take off her windbreaker and also taking off his own coat to put it on her, but she dodged away.

He hesitated for a moment, then walked up and wanted to take the windbreaker.

Give it to me. You like this piece of clothing so much, I'll take it back and have it cleaned.

Katrina shook her head and directly threw the clothes into the roadside trash bin, her tone indifferent.

Give it up, I don't like things that are stained, you know, I have OCD.

Seeing her cold expression, Jamir's smile froze on his face.

He knew that what she said was not just about clothes, but also about emotions.

After that night, he was completely immersed in pain.

He was afraid that Katrina would leave him because of this, afraid that she would break up with him, afraid that the two of them would never be able to go back to the way things were.

So he could only secretly hide it.

Yes, as long as he keeps it a secret, waits for the child to be born, and then hands the child over to the grandmother for adoption, everything will be fine.

He didn't dare to know Katrina's reaction after she found out. He could lose anyone, except Katrina.

He changed his expression, but Katrina didn't look at Jamir's face. She just quietly looked out the window.

Recalling the moment I first learned about this, I remembered the years of emotions, remembering Jamir, whom I loved dearly. She did try, hiding all the pain, pretending as if nothing had happened.

But she couldn't do it.

She couldn't accept any flaws.

So, after struggling for two months, she decided to let herself go.

Katrina knew that no matter what, Jamir would not accept the proposal to cancel the engagement.

After all, in the past, for the sake of her dance career, she had once proposed a breakup.

That time, Jamir relentlessly followed her, pestering her for a month to reconcile.

She didn't want to repeat the same mistakes.

So, that's why she planned this elopement.

If anyone in this circle could take her away from Jamir, there was only one person, his archenemy - Beckett Zeller.

So, she approached him today.

Fortunately, he also agreed.

Along the way, Jamir remained the same as usual, finding different topics to make her happy.

Katrina, however, couldn't muster any enthusiasm and fell asleep by the window.

When she woke up, she found herself lying on the bed in the bedroom, and the nanny beside her brought her milk.

""Ms. Wilson, this was just prepared by Mr. Jamir for you to drink when you wake up. He is currently selecting fresh flowers in the garden, should I ask him to come up?""

Katrina shook her head, got up and walked to the window. As soon as she glanced down, she saw him holding a rose and carefully placing it in a vase, completely focused.

Half an hour later, Jamir brought the freshly inserted flowers upstairs and handed them to her, asking if she liked them.

She nodded lightly, and a smile instantly appeared on his face.

At night, Katrina stared at the ceiling for a long time unable to fall asleep.

At eleven o'clock, there were two knocks on the door. Jamir walked in, holding a pillow, and insisted that he couldn't sleep and wanted to sleep with her.

Katrina did not refuse and made half of the bed available, allowing him to put his arm around her shoulder.

Half an hour later, there came a shallow breathing sound beside me.

She reached out her hand, found his phone from under the pillow, unlocked the password, opened WhatsApp, found Mariela, and scrolled all the way to the top.

From March to April, Mariela would report the children's situation to him every day, with a respectful and humble tone.

Jamir, however, never turned back.

On April 17th, a green message finally appeared on the right side.

""Stop it, don't you know what this child means to me? Everyone was looking forward to his birth, except for me!""

Mariela only said one sentence, ""I'm sorry.""

Over a month later, the two of them did not chat again.

By mid-May, Mariela had started reporting on time again.

Scrolling down further, the green messages increased slowly from 0, the word count started to become more, and the tone was no longer as harsh.

""When I saw you after work, you had lost quite a bit of weight. Eat more, the child also needs nutrition.""

""Did I hear someone in the company gossiping and bullying you? Are you a fool? Being bullied every day, if there's a problem, come directly to me.""

A typhoon is coming in a couple of days. Stay at home and don't go out. I will have my secretary deliver some supplies.

If I remember correctly, for the whole month of May, she was rehearsing the latest dance drama abroad.

The private detective said that during that time, Valeria brought Mariela back to the Lancaster's house, hoping to bring the two people closer.

So, since then, did Jamir start to care about Mariela?

Katrina's eyelashes trembled slightly, her fingers continued to slide down, and finally settled on today.

What time was the prenatal check-up? Send me the address.

""Mr. Jamir, weren't you supposed to accompany Ms. Wilson today?""

""You don't need to worry about it, address.""

Jamir's tone was not very good.

But Katrina knew that, with his personality, if he really didn't care, he would never take the initiative.

This time, he used the excuse of having a meeting at work to cancel the date and then accompanied Mariela to her prenatal check-up.

She was no longer the one who always put everything first in Jamir's heart.

Katrina looked at the person beside her pillow and chuckled self-deprecatingly.

She continued to open Mariela's Instagram.

Three months of display range, over twenty Instagram posts, nearly a hundred photos, recorded every little bit of this child's growth.

The latest few, slowly appeared photos of Jamir.

The focused expression while driving, the furrowed brow while reading the prenatal check-up report, the indecisive look while choosing baby clothes.

As she watched, Katrina felt like she was about to run out of breath.

If we talk about the night before, it was a series of unfortunate events, it was unavoidable. But what about his recent care for Mariela?

Was it also inevitable?

She put the phone back in its original position, and in the next moment, Jamir, who was still asleep, instinctively pulled her into his arms.

The once greatly relied upon embrace has now become unbearable.

She took a deep breath and gently pushed him away.

Jamir.

One more month.

In one month, I could completely leave you.

# Chapter 3

The next day, after finishing breakfast, Jamir did not get up for a long time.

Katrina casually asked a question, and he pulled her into his arms, nuzzling against her neck.

""Katrina, I didn't want to go to work, I just wanted to be with you every day. It's perfect that you have a few days off, can you accompany me to the office? This way, I can see you anytime and it will give me the motivation to work.""

The maid on the side heard these cheesy words and immediately covered her face. In her heart, she muttered, ""Jamir is indeed a romantic fool.""

Katrina, however, showed no expression and nodded indifferently, ""Okay.""

Coincidentally, she also wanted to meet that Mariela.

When they arrived at the company, Jamir led her. Instead of taking the private elevator to the CEO's office, they swiped their employee cards and pressed the button for the seventeenth floor.

""In the morning, there was a collaboration meeting at the Planning Department. Let's go there first and have a look.""

He kept talking to himself, while Katrina remained silent.

Although she had never worked in a company, she was aware that if it was a significant collaboration, it would definitely be held in the top-level conference room.

Remembering last night on Mariela's Instagram, seeing her selfie with the Planning Department badge, Katrina instantly understood.

The intention of the drunken wanderer was not in the wine.

Just out of the elevator, two people heard a burst of harsh cursing coming from the room.

""I wanted an iced Americano! How do you handle things? Can't even get a simple cup of coffee right? You look like a bumpkin and your brain is so dumb. How did your company even hire such an employee? Can't they replace you with someone smart and good-looking to serve customers?""

Upon hearing the dissatisfaction of his business partner Seth Reeves, Jamir instinctively furrowed his brow.

As soon as he entered, he saw Mariela being scolded with her head down. A hint of coldness flashed in his eyes, and he immediately let go of Katrina's hand and walked quickly towards her.

""Mr. Reeves, I presume you came this time to discuss collaboration, not to humiliate our company employees. If you possess such character, it is safe to say that the Lancaster Group and the Reeves Group will never have another opportunity for cooperation in this lifetime.""

Seth blushed as the cold words were spoken. He couldn't believe that Jamir would confront their business partner directly for a regular employee. He couldn't handle the situation and didn't know what to do.

The whole office buzzed with whispers and discussions.

Katrina stood still, listening to the discussions of the people below, but her eyes remained fixed on Jamir.

He seemed not to have seen those gazes, cold-faced, he took Mariela back to his workstation. With a sweep of his eyes, he saw the sticky notes on the desk, and his face turned cold again.

""10 o'clock, prepare the meeting room. 14 o'clock, photocopy the documents? I remember the Planning Department has an assistant! You all pushed these miscellaneous tasks onto Mariela? Find out who wrote these sticky notes, those who neglect their duties in their positions, all fired!""

After a few words, most of the employees turned pale, and there was silence in the office.

Mariela was extremely grateful, and her eyes were filled with deep love as she looked at him.

As she turned around, she saw Katrina standing at the door. She froze instantly, and the emotions on her face vanished like smoke.

Watching her transformation, Katrina lowered her gaze and turned away, leaving the office.

Jamir searched for a whole hour before finding her on the rooftop of the company.

Seeing that she looked off, he realized that it might be because of the incident he had just stood up for Mariela. He quickly hugged her and explained, ""Katrina, please don't misunderstand. I just can't stand seeing the company employees being bullied...""

Katrina smirked sarcastically, suddenly feeling a strong urge to expose him.

But in the end, she held back and whispered, ""I didn't misunderstand, I just wanted to come up and relax. It's only right for you to stand up for the company's employees.""

Jamir finally breathed a sigh of relief and took her downstairs.

While having lunch, Jamir picked the fish bones and listened to the assistant's report.

""Mr. Jamir, did you go to the charity auction in the evening?""

""Go and have the organizers send over three invitation letters.""

""Three?""

The assistant looked at Katrina, unsure about the amount, and expressed doubt.

Jamir also turned around and caught the calmness in her eyes. He explained to her again, ""Today Mariela was called a country bumpkin, and I saw that she was about to cry. I thought it was just a dinner, so I wanted to take her out to see the world and relax. Katrina, I have a meeting this afternoon. If you have nothing to do, take her out for a walk, just to pass the time.""

Unprovoked kindness, clumsy lies, evasive gaze, all confirm that Jamir's words and heart are not in harmony, insincere.

Katrina quietly watched him, still without exposing him, nodded and agreed.

So the whole afternoon, Mariela followed her around, first they went to buy a few evening gowns, then they went to pick out a set of jewelry, and finally they went to the hair salon to get a new hairstyle.

The two people walked along the way, one in front and one behind, without any communication throughout the journey.

Mariela was like a Barbie doll, obediently letting Katrina dress her up from beginning to end, without uttering a single opinion.

When Jamir arrived after the meeting, Mariela had just finished putting on makeup and stood up.

He caught a glimpse of astonishment in his eyes, but his footsteps did not pause. He walked straight to Katrina's side and took her hand.

""The dress you picked today was so beautiful, and the jewelry complemented your skin tone, Katrina. You look so stunning that I don't even want to take you out, afraid that someone might snatch you away.""

Katrina remained silent and did not respond.

She turned to the side and saw Mariela, who lowered her head with a look of self-doubt, her hand holding the skirt paused.

The next second, a slightly deep voice of Jamir rang in my ears.

""Mariela, you were not bad today.""

Mariela's eyes instantly lit up with joy, and she stammered, ""R-really... really? Thank you, Mr. Jamir.""

She was probably really fond of Jamir, because of that compliment, throughout the rest of the party, she appeared to be very happy.

Until the auction stage.

For the auction dinner, Katrina specifically donated three pairs of pearl earrings, totaling three million.

Finally, it was bought back by Jamir for a total price of ten million.

Hearing the continuous bidding voices in the venue, Mariela thought of something and, trembling with fear, mustered up the courage to pull Katrina's hand, her tone filled with hesitation.

""Ms. Wilson, were all the items donated at the auction so expensive? I didn't know before...""

Watching her restless demeanor, Katrina was about to explain when the auctioneer on stage happened to showcase a new item.

""The 32nd item, handmade wish stars donated by Ms. Mariela, with a starting price of one dollar. Before the auction, let us first ask Ms. Mariela to stand up and be acknowledged.""

# Chapter 4

All previous auction items had this segment, and Mariela could only force herself to stand up.

Curious eyes from all directions turned into uproarious laughter upon seeing her embarrassed face.

""One dollar? Are you kidding me? She dares to donate this kind of junk?""

Those who come here are all influential figures in the circle. How did someone like Cinderella manage to infiltrate, and can we kick her out?

Mariela's face turned blue and purple from being mocked, and she immediately buried her head.

For a moment, the atmosphere of the entire venue was ignited, and everyone was laughing at this item.

Jamir's face instantly darkened, and he directly instructed the assistant to hold up a sign.

""On the 17th, Mr. Jamir bid ten million!""

All eyes in the room turned to the central area, and this time, everyone looked at Jamir with a shocked expression.

Other people saw him bidding high, and for a moment, they all stopped mocking and started discussing whether there was something special about this box of stars that they hadn't noticed. They all hesitantly raised their paddles, trying to test the waters.

Jamir also chased without showing any weakness, and finally snapped it up with a sky-high price of three billion, causing the whole audience to gasp in astonishment.

""A box of stars for three billion? Is Mr. Jamir out of his mind?""

""Even if it's extremely special, is it not worth three billion?""

Listening to the whispering behind her, Mariela lost control of her emotions and ran away from the venue with red eyes.

Jamir looked at her back and immediately furrowed his brows.

""Katrina, you take a look first. If you like anything, take a picture of it. I have something urgent to attend to, so I'll leave now.""

Without waiting for Katrina's response, he hurriedly chased after her.

After a moment of silence, Katrina also stood up, looking at the prying gazes around her.

The corridor was quiet, and even though there was some distance, I could still clearly hear Mariela's choked voice.

""Mr. Jamir, don't be so good to me. The more you care about me, the more I am afraid of losing you, because I know in the end I have to return you to Ms. Wilson. Just thinking about that day makes me very painful, but I can't fight for you, you never belonged to me.""

Hearing her words, Jamir frowned deeply.

""Mr. Jamir, we are ending it here, okay...""

Seeing the person in front of him continuing to say that they wanted to leave, he could no longer control the overwhelming anger in his heart. He immediately grabbed the person and kissed them.

A chill rose from the soles of her feet and surged straight into Katrina's heart.

She stared fixedly at the two people immersed in a kiss, her fingers uncontrollably trembling.

I don't know how long it had been, but Jamir finally let go of Mariela.

He raised his hand and quickly wiped away the tears on her face.

""Mariela, I don't know what happened to me, but seeing you being so submissive, I couldn't control myself. So, please take care of yourself and don't let anyone bully you anymore, or else I can't help but want to protect you!""

""Only a few months left, once you give birth to the child, we will go our separate ways, and never see each other again.""

Jamir spoke each word with great force, whether he was comforting Mariela or hypnotizing himself, it was unclear.

Katrina wanted to laugh, but her whole face froze and she couldn't make any expression.

She raised her hand and touched her cheek, feeling the icy cold and damp sensation on her fingertips.

She had already made up her mind to give up.

But why, when seeing this scene, would there still be heartache?

She wiped away her tears bit by bit, and then turned around and left.

Katrina, I only allowed this to be the last time, the last time to shed tears for Jamir.

On the way back, Katrina sat in the back seat.

Jamir hesitated for a moment, a hint of guilt flickered in his eyes. ""The assistant took Mariela home. She was very sad today, so I comforted her for a while. Katrina, please don't be angry, okay?""

Katrina didn't want to hear him speak anymore, so she closed her eyes.

""No anger, I was tired.""

Jamir wisely closed his mouth.

One night, the two people did not speak again.

The next morning, Jamir still took her to the dance troupe.

As soon as she reached the door, a woman in her early thirties came running towards her with a knife, her face full of hatred.

""Katrina, why wouldn't you let go of even my farewell performance! I had worked so hard to secure the leading role, and now you want to snatch it away!""

Seeing the sharp sword coming, without thinking, he directly stood in front of her.

""Katrina!""

The security guard, who had rushed upon receiving the message, subdued the knife-wielder, but Jamir fell into Katrina's arms.

A piercing pain spread from his chest, and he felt his strength draining away. His mind went blank.

As far as the eye could see, the last thing seen was only Katrina's eyes, filled with panic and disbelief.

He mustered up his last bit of strength and raised his hand, covering her eyes. The last words that squeezed out of his throat were not a cry of pain, but rather, ""Be good, don't be afraid.""

The ambulance quickly arrived and directly took the person to the emergency room.

The lights in the operating room went out two hours later, and the doctor walked out to see Katrina, who was already numb. There was a sense of emotion in his tone.

""The surgery was successful, Mr. Jamir is fine, but if it had been a few millimeters off, it would have pierced his heart and he wouldn't have been able to be saved. Ms. Wilson, Mr. Jamir didn't hesitate to shield you from the knife, he truly loves you to the core.""

Katrina's tense body finally relaxed.

She couldn't speak, lowered her head, and stared at the bloodstains on her clothes in a daze.

Ten minutes passed, and suddenly the phone rang.

She picked up the phone and heard Beckett's slightly anxious voice in her ear.

""Did the news report say that you were stabbed and injured?""

""No, Jamir stood in front of me.""

The phone fell silent for more than ten seconds, and suddenly there came a self-mocking chuckle.

""Did he love you so much? Why, was he moved? Should we cancel our cooperation?""

Even Beckett himself did not realize that there was a hint of inexplicable tension in his tone.

Katrina did not immediately answer him.

Her mind was in a mess, with many images flashing through.

When Jamir was young, he got into a fight with some thugs, which resulted in him losing his qualification to be admitted to a top university.

After graduation, she ran around to dance, and he followed her all over the world.

As long as she said a word, no matter where he was or what he was doing, he would always appear in front of her immediately.

It is an undeniable fact that Jamir loved her.

But while he loved her, he would also fall in love with other women.

What Katrina wanted was uniqueness.

She would not give up her own beliefs for his love, just as she would not give up her career for his proposal.

Principled issues, she would not forgive, never forgive!

The long silence made Beckett mistakenly think that the other side had hung up the phone.

He was about to put down his phone when he heard Katrina's resolute voice in his ear.

""No need to cancel, continue.""

# Chapter 5

After the Lancaster family arrived, Katrina left the hospital and went to the police station.

After finishing the transcript, it was already 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

She hailed a car and just as she got in, Jamir's assistant called.

""Ms. Wilson, Mr. Jamir has already woken up. I have contacted someone to handle the person from this morning, but Mr. Jamir is still worried and insists on investigating the whole matter with the dance troupe. He says he's afraid you might encounter danger again. However, the doctor said he is seriously injured and needs to rest in bed, otherwise the wound could reopen and be very dangerous. Can you personally go and persuade him to reconsider?""

Katrina agreed and gave the driver the address of the hospital.

Just as she reached the door of the ward, a familiar voice made her stop in her tracks.

""Can't you rest peacefully with such a serious injury? The culprit has already been caught, so can we handle the remaining matters after you recover?""

It was Mariela's voice.

""I knew how to take care of myself, you didn't need to worry.""

Jamir's tone wasn't particularly good, but by saying that, he basically agreed to her.

No one understood his insincere temperament better than Katrina.

As they spoke, the atmosphere gradually improved.

Katrina listened to two sentences, pushed open the door and walked in, and immediately saw the scene of Mariela feeding him a bowl of soup.

He obediently drank with his head down, the two of them looked just like an old married couple, even their actions of turning their heads when they heard a noise were particularly in sync.

Katrina silently watched them, without saying a word. The two of them panicked first, and started explaining in a flurry of words.

""She happened to come to the hospital for a check-up...""

""Ms. Wilson, don't misunderstand, Mr. Jamir helped me recently and I am very grateful to him. I heard that he got injured, so I wanted to come and check on him. Mr. Jamir said he was hungry, and I was afraid that feeding him might disturb his wound.""

It wasn't that tacit originally.

Katrina pondered and remained silent for a moment.

Seeing her silence, the two people with inconsistent testimonies became even more flustered. Mariela, in particular, was so afraid of affecting the two of them that she hurriedly stood up and walked out.

""Since Ms. Wilson came, I won't disturb you for now.""

The door closed with a soft sound, coinciding with the sudden pouring rain outside the window.

Jamir subconsciously wanted to chase after, but he glanced at Katrina and stopped his steps.

""It was on her way to the prenatal check-up today that she heard about my injury and came over, Katrina, don't worry too much.""

The fact was right in front of her, Katrina didn't need to worry.

She didn't say anything else, walked to the bedside and sat down, picking up the medical record beside her.

Jamir was still talking non-stop, and the topic had already shifted to the morning's events.

When that person rushed up, my heart was about to stop. Katrina, luckily you're okay.

These days, you stayed at home and rested well. I will take care of the matters with the dance troupe.

Katrina listened quietly as he spoke, her eyes fixed on the medical records, but she noticed that every time he spoke, his gaze would shift to the window.

She turned her body and looked over.

It was such a heavy rain.

No wonder he was so worried.

He said a few more words and Jamir immediately made a phone call to his assistant, asking him to call a car to come and let Katrina go back and rest early.

Katrina didn't hesitate, got up and went downstairs to the car.

The driver asked for the address, she shook her head, handed over a stack of money, and asked him to wait a little longer.

Three minutes later, Jamir walked out of the hospital, clutching his wound, and got into the assistant's car.",1,1747739165.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Somewhere along the way, we stopped living and started existing. The great trap — that relentless cycle of expectations and obligations — has made us brittle. It splinters us, bit by bit. Work. Work. And more work. We chase weekends like mirages in a desert, praying for the next public holiday, clinging to the hope of a promotion that might never come. Some call it corporate labour; I call it the death trap. “Get out now!” my mom’s voice rang out, cutting through the fog of my thoughts. “Kavir are you going to stay in there all day?” she added, her tone edged with impatience. Startled, I snapped back to reality. Right — I was still in the bathroom. And I still hadn’t taken a shower.

It was the peak of summer, and my friends and I had just finished our exams, the weight of textbooks finally lifted from our shoulders. Bursting with excitement on the first day of our holidays, we rushed out of our homes like elephants and rhinos charging toward a watering hole, eager to reclaim our freedom. We gathered in the building lobby, buzzing with energy and looking for something exciting to do. That’s when a mischievous idea struck me — “Let’s make fake Instagram profiles,” I suggested, thinking it would be harmless fun. Little did I know, that one spontaneous decision would end up changing my life in ways I never saw coming.

Before my friends dragged me into the prank, I had already tasted more failures than most teenagers. I had tried building an e-commerce brand at fourteen, burned through my savings on a dropshipping project that never took off, and ran a blog where I poured my heart into writing creative articles—only for it to fade into digital silence. My proudest creation was [Bookaholic.in](http://Bookaholic.in), a curated online bookstore I launched from my bedroom. For a while, it felt like I’d made it. But when it flopped, it crushed something in me. Maybe that’s why I became quiet. Invisible. I stopped believing I could succeed at anything real. That day, when we created the fake Instagram account, I wasn’t chasing fun. I was chasing someone else’s skin—someone confident, admired… someone not me.



Everyone was instantly on board, and just like that, we had a new conquest to embark upon. 	Energised by the shared mischief, we pulled out our phones and began crafting our fake Instagram profile. For the perfect display picture, we turned to the ever-reliable treasure trove — Pinterest.

As we scrolled, something stopped me. A single image. A girl, mid-laugh, her eyes closed, a few strands of hair swept across her cheek by the wind. She wasn’t exaggerated like those heavily filtered influencers—she was natural, effortlessly magnetic. There was a kind of rawness in her that made my chest tighten. I couldn’t look away.

“This one,” I said, holding up the image.

Kabir whistled. “Dude. If she was real, I’d marry her.”

Neel smirked. “Probably AI. Or some Russian model.”

But I didn’t laugh with them. I felt… odd. A strange pulse beneath my skin. The kind of ache you feel when you glimpse something you didn’t know you were missing. But I forced the feeling down. We named her Rhea Dsouza, gave her a soft, artsy bio: “dreamer ✨ | painter 🎨 | coffee addict ☕ | 19 | Goa 💛.” Just enough fiction to make her believable. I uploaded the photo and watched our creation come to life.

Within hours, she had followers. Boys from our college started liking her photos, replying to her stories. She was beautiful, mysterious, and apparently, irresistible. The DMs began trickling in—compliments, emojis, a few flirty attempts. At first, it was hilarious. We took turns replying, saying the dumbest things, making bets on who would fall hardest. It was all a game.

But slowly, something shifted. The others lost interest after a few days. Rishi got caught sneaking out and was grounded. Neel moved on to simping over a new crush. Kabir was busy on a family road trip. But me? I stayed. I logged into the account more frequently than I checked my own. I started posting curated stories, writing captions that sounded poetic and deep. People responded. They listened. They cared. Nobody ever cared about me that way. Not the real me. I was just another forgettable face in a sea of average. But Anaisha? She was admired. She was wanted. And slowly, I started to feel more myself when I was her. It was intoxicating. Every like, every message, every digital interaction—it filled the silence in my life.

One night, curiosity got the better of me. I reverse image searched the original photo. I told myself it was just for fun. Just to see where it came from. But when the results loaded, my breath caught in my throat.

She was real.

Her name was Anaisha Shah. An art student from Pune. She had a blog called “Brushstrokes & Breaths.” Her real Instagram was linked. Private, but her profile picture matched. Her name. Her face. Her life—it all existed. And I had been parading around inside it like a thief in someone else’s home. I should have deleted everything right then. Logged out. Disappeared. But I didn’t. I followed her real account from a dummy profile. No messages. No likes. Just silent observation. I told myself it wasn’t stalking. I was only watching. Admiring, even. There’s no harm in admiring someone, right? Except admiration has a way of mutating into obsession when left unchecked.

I began studying her. Her art, her captions, her friends. She always wrote in lowercase, like her words were too delicate to shout. Her paintings were abstract and filled with emotion—colorful grief in motion. She posted pictures of her journal, her coffee cups, her favorite corner in her room where she painted late at night. It felt… personal. And I started to know things about her that I had no right to know.

One evening, a guy left a weird comment on one of her paintings. It was suggestive, uncomfortable. She didn’t reply. But I noticed. I used the fake Anaisha account to message him from another direction, anonymously, hinting that someone was watching. He blocked her the next day. She never knew why. But I did. I told myself I was doing something good. I was protecting her. That was the beginning of the lie I would eventually start believing. That I wasn’t a predator. That I wasn’t doing harm. That I was some kind of invisible guardian—keeping the wolves at bay while she painted in peace.

I began justifying more and more of it. I tracked the places she visited through geotags. I guessed her university schedule based on what days she posted stories from campus. I wrote fake poetry and posted it on “her” account—poems I had written late at night, too scared to share under my own name. People messaged her saying she was brave. That she had touched them. That she made them feel seen.

But nobody saw me.

And that’s how it all started. With a prank. A pretty picture. A moment of boredom that spiraled into something darker. I didn’t know then how deep I would go, how much I would lose, or what it would cost me to come back.

Looking back now, I don’t even know what scared me more—the fact that I was pretending to be someone else, or the fact that I felt more real while doing it.

My husband and I spent the first 18 months of our relationship constantly fighting, and the remaining 2 years has been no fighting at all. The first 18 months were ALWAYS regarding his ex wife. He left due to chronic infidelity with lack of remorse, and when I met him his ex still had him running errands for her. If she said jump, he asked how high. Until I came into the picture and she demanded he get rid of me and, when he refused to do that, all hell broke loose. His reason for always catering to her was that he was worried she would take his kids from him because she’s vengeful at heart, and I guess he wasn’t wrong. 

Every parental alienation and false child abuse accusation came flying out of the woodworks. It was constant obsession with me. What I was doing. Where I was. She broke into my house and went through my personal belongings. She turned the kids against him one by one. One of them no longer lives with us, however my husband still coaches his baseball team. 

When his son lived with us, he could be a bully to my children (only during the first day he returned from his mom’s house) but other than that was mostly a good kid and got along well with my kids. Since moving in with his mom full time for the last year, he’s been in trouble for cheating, lying, stealing, and attempting to set school property on fire. And those are just what he’s gotten caught doing. 

We got married last month, and out of nowhere his ex now needs us to take his son (who doesn’t live with us) at the last minute. She used to do everything possible to prevent my husband from interacting with his son (including trying to remove him from baseball, which his dad coaches). Now she can’t be bothered with him pretty much every weekend. She did this exact same thing when our “ours” baby was born. 

Instead of my husband saying “no, you can abide by the custody order and give me my son back on my time” he just rolls over and is there when she says jump. Which was exactly what he was doing to begin with. 

I’m over it. I’m not dealing with round two of what this is about to turn into. My thoughts and feelings are never taken into consideration. I recently joined a discount air program and have been wanting to travel more, my husbands schedule doesn’t permit that and he’s been upset about even the idea of me leaving him behind to go away for a weekend (I used to work as a charge nurse every other weekend, specifically the weekends his kids were here, and am now home every weekend. I’d essentially be swapping work for a weekend away from people who probably wish I didn’t exist). I decided I am taking my children for the July 4 weekend to San Francisco. And I’m about ready to just stay out there and not return back to this absolute mess that I’ve willingly put myself in. 

I’m not sure why I’m even posting this. Probably just to scream into the void at 5am with my cup of coffee. But I’m sick of what has happened over the last 4 years. I’ve been vilified, slandered, she’s done everything possible to make her kids hate me and it’s so uncomfortable being in my own home at times. I am an RN in an executive management position and by default when she makes her deranged allegations she is also coming after my career.

Posting this from the breakroom at my workplace, just call me Nate (technically Nate Jr., blame my Mum), it's around 6:30pm, probably 8pm when I'll post this, I guess it's a whole run of random thoughts for me, so things will be a bit disjointed.

To start with, I am (as of now) the ADM (Assistant Department Manager) of the Front End of Willy's Wonderstore, a local branch of supermarkets in my homestate of Queensland. (Yes, I'm Aussie.)  
Used to work for the bigger chains when I was around 14, quickly realised all the big claims of ""Family"" were manipulative tactics by the time I had my first drink at 16. (Best night of my life, if I'm honest, gotta miss the days of high school sometimes... even if my friends and I broke the law.)  
Shortly after that, I was without a job, home was a mess, mum couldn't handle all the stress alone, sending me to school and working a 7 day job, so I had to find a new job for myself, real quick, without the issue of corporate manipulation looming over my shoulder.

That's where Willy's Wonderstore came in, it was a local brand, reputable, small. Living in a low income house with my widowed mum, I of course jumped at the chance to work for them, skip forward a whole 7 years and I'm a scruffy 23yr old employee who still hasn't climbed the corporate ladder. Pay's good, mum was able to quit her shitty job, since I was able to pay off the debts she'd racked up after dad left us and this world.

Only reason I explain this, is so that you know why I can't just hand in my two weeks and quit.

But that's enough of me, I should explain why I am posting this and asking for your advice and help. I started my ADM position about 2 months back, around the time our PDM Rebbeca was in her third trimester and forced to go on maternity leave. Woman had to be told by the store managed to go on leave, or he'd fire her, she loved the Front End, meeting people, but I could not imagine the strain she must have been in, hence why she was forced to take time off.

So, with her being put on limited time and me being added as her second in command, I was trained and then given the expectation to take over from her for the time she's gone (I doubt it's a short time, her husband was an amputee, real bad car crash, so he was wheelchair bound. Great guy though, killer stories about his time in the air force. So taking care of a baby is gonna run them both ragged), which included doing one of the strangest tasks you could think a check-out worker would have to do- opening and closing the store at night.

Willy's operates on a more lax schedule, we open at 10am sharp, every morning, close at 6pm, regardless of weekday or weekend (on holidays we stay open until 9pm.). But then, we open back up at 11pm until 4am every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The Manager calls it 'Graveyard Trading Hours', payrates are doubled and it's a pretty sweet deal. At least, that's what I was thinking, at first.

Part of Rebbeca's duties was starting at 12pm and at the end of the shift, having us close up at 6pm and then returning at 11pm to open up again, with the now ex ADM, Kyle, closing at 4am. Only reason she was needed was to verify headcount, so that no one was trying to pretend to be a member of staff, or sneak in a shift on the rather gullible shift system for a quick and easy buck at double the rate.

Me, though, I fulfil both their roles, I arrive at work at 11:50am sharp and then clock in at 11:54am. I just find the early start helps me figure out what the day is going to be like, what stock is on hand, the usual.

I work on front end, keep the staff members in line, sell liquor and other 18+ stuff to the occasional customer, usually met with grunts and growls about the need for ID, the average crap that you get being on the main counter. After that, around closing time (5:30pm), we take out the trash from any of the registers, if you work in retail, you know the drill, send one of the juniors off with the trash bags to chuck them into the dumpster out back near the loading bay.

Then, I take my copy of the store keys and bring down the roller doors, leaving only the one next to the express register open so the nightfill team can herd any confused customers out (usually the elderly who can't really tell the time while in a grocery store) through it. Once all the customers are gone, I close the last roller door, say goodnight to the nightfill ADM, Sarah and let the Front End team out through the exit door on the dock. By the end of that, it is usually 6:10pm, then I have to perform a 20 minute double take on our store's security footage, for anything that comes up on the security cameras. (They have a program on them that puts a highlight on anything that does not line up at the Front End.)

Trawling through hazy freezeframes, I have to label them under different categories, whether they are considered to be of concern, a scan that didn't go through or even shoplifting an item. Half the time it's just the camera bugging out because someone bought something from somewhere else and has it in their trolley.

By 6:30pm, I save all the categories into a folder for the Store Manager, David, to look through when he opens in the morning at 10am. I then stay back until 7pm, having to check through my team's statistics (contract hours, any duty limitations, workplace notices on behaviour.)

Now, due to my task as ADM, on any of the days we don't have the bizarre night trading hours, it's just a simple 7hr shift, I come in just before 12, finish at 7 and go home to my mum and our black cat, Coal.  
But for Monday, Wednesday and Friday, the schedule changes, come in early, keep the team in check, work until 6, then close the roller doors and let the team out. But instead of staying back, I myself have to leave at 6pm too, as I am expected to return in 5hrs to reopen the store.

What I do, on those nights, is that I will head home (a good 25 minute walk to our quaint family home) and take a 3hr power nap, usually with Coal laying his plump, fuzzy mass on top of my neck like a scarf. Mum then will wake me up, as she is about to go to bed, usually scooping up the pudgy black cat as she goes and I will take a quick hot shower and swap my work hat and shirt, to feel fresh. Then I walk back to work, usually grabbing a small bite to eat on the way from one of the local fast food places on the route to Willy's.

By the time I am back at Willy's Wonderstore, the nightfill team will be packing up and heading home, with Sarah and I inverting our farewell, where I wave goodbye to her, instead of her doing so. I will note that I am not alone, during this time, as I am accompanied by team members from what David calls ""The Graveyard Shift"", they don't talk much, mostly keep to themselves and seem to focus solely on scanning items, droning out responses and packing bags. I can understand the feeling, though, they are having to do night shift and check-out work, it's not too fun to combine too rather dreary tasks into one.

The customers we get at night aren't the worst, as we live in a decently small country town, mostly stoners, angsty teens, stressed out college kids and the rare nutcase that come through. Once we get near 4am, I then do the usual closing up procedure, roller doors, trash and footage, along with reports.

What I could not understand, though, is that the cameras would sometimes affix on random customers the other staff serve, usually focussing on the oddest of spots, like the neck flab of a man in a mobility scooter, or the broken arm of a wannabe punk artist. As I've said, the footage is hazy, so I don't understand why the cameras do it, meaning that I have to write those off as simple irrelevancy.

But, besides the bizarre customers and dreary co-workers, the late night trade pays well and goes by quickly. At least, it used to be, until last Monday.

Last Monday marked the start of it getting cold over here, real cold... Fog, cold dribbles of rain, dry winds and the usual prelude to winter. It also marked the night shift getting a lot less breezy.

I entered through the back, being waved at by Sarah as I turned left into the stockroom and walked past the shelves of overstocked items, heading for the staff breakroom and offices just on the other side. I'd gotten a chicken burger meal on the way, it was steaming hot, so I was a bit slower than my usual brisk pace, especially being rugged up in at least three layers. What was especially different was that after waving, I heard Sarah call to me. I looked back, seeing that she had been trying to wave me over, rather than wave goodbye.

Turning on my heels, I headed back to her, she looked a bit spooked, I then noticed her team had headed home early, from the looks of it, the night's load still had at least 2 pallets remaining (they were T3s, for anyone that is interested, soft drink and energy drinks.). I can clearly remember how our exchange went, as usually I was the one to get a conversation started, but this time, Sarah spoke first:

'Nate, I'm gonna be staying back tonight for a bit, alright? Apparently some weirdo was lingering at the roller doors, staring at team members. I'll be clocked off, but I want you to keep your earpiece on you.'

I shrugged, but then nodded.

'Alright, you want me to tell the other team members to keep an eye out?'

She seemed to flinch when I mentioned the team, which caused me to frown, why was she wanting me to keep information about a possible person that needed blacklisting from my team?

'No, I don't think that'd be best, it's just... a hunch, I guess.'

'You're not one for hunches, though.'

I'd known Sarah since I started at the store, her and I were part of the same hiring pool, started same day, we'd built a decent work friendship, it was unlike her to act this way, more to keep anything to herself when it came to her thoughts.

'I can't say... just follow me.'

Sarah didn't budge, instead deciding to drag me off like a lost child to the communications office.

At our work place, there are two offices, David's Office, where meetings are held and paperwork is kept, then there is the Communications Office, where we store two outdated PCs, our singular printer and the charging dock for our walkies and earpieces, it is also where you have to clock in on the computer, entering payroll number and your personalised password. Both offices are the only rooms in the staff only area that have locks besides the back door and loading bay roller door.

Sarah handed me an earpiece, the mess of wires having to be untangled in my one free hand so the power source could clip onto my belt and the tiny audio receiver could clip to my work shirt's breast pocket. The earpiece itself looping around my ear and the speaker dangling just above the eardrum.

'Listen, I just need you to be my eyes and ears out there, alright? I can do the reports and footage for you, as long as you let me stay in the main office. Don't let the others know I'm here.'

Sarah definitely was acting strange, evasive, without a moment for me to even ask what the hell she was on about, the lock clicked on the door to David's office, leaving me alone for the next five minutes.

Usually, if I had the time, I'd have looked at what we had stored in the overstock shelves, but the now lukewarm burger beckoned to me, as I felt my body yearn for some sustenance. I obliged it and quickly stored away my clothing in my work locker, still keeping at least a jacket and scarf on me, having to fiddle with my name badge to get it to click onto my jacket instead of my shirt. As I stepped out of the men's locker room, I then heard the far off noise of my co-workers cars pulling into the parking spaces.

Sarah was silent on the communication channel, even as I did a headcount on the mopey crew I called my teammates, though I could have sworn one looked slightly confused at me. If they had tried to speak, though, it seems they didn't see the point in bothering.

All went normal, or as normal as serving the odd and zany could be. It was around 1am that I heard Sarah on the earpiece, seems she had gone over to the communications office once the other team members had clocked in, I could hear the whirring of the overtaxed fan within one of the PCs on her end.

'Register 3, man in a mobility scooter, back of his neck.'

It was a surprise to hear her, but I made sure to show little sign of reacting, hiding the surprise with the realisation that I had not refilled the drink fridges on the registers, something that gave me an excuse to go past Register 3.

Registers 1 and 2 had fully stocked beverages, but 3 had been decently emptied, a good amount of traffic having passed through, the current customer being served was a rather obese man on a mobility scooter. I didn't judge people's weight, but internally, I did feel sorry for how his joints must be, at least, until I caught sight of the back of his neck, right at the nape. I didn't understand what I saw, at least, not immediately.

'What do you see?'

Sarah asked, I didn't respond, I averted my gaze and placed the drinks in according order. Though I think the customer noticed, as a rumbling voice came to my attention, a thick lisp to his voice.

'Excoose me, do you hath sum shashparella?'

I looked down to the crate of drinks in my hands, I did indeed, so I handed one to him, but he seemed disappointed.

'Maw pweash'

I offered the crate and he beamed like a child on Christmas day. He took all of them, which, in my honest opinion, was financially wasteful, a 350ml bottle of sars from us runs you $3.50 per bottle, he had taken at least 23 of them, minus the one I had put on the shelf of the drink fridge. The server shot a death stare at me, as she had to put more items in more bags for her customer, but the customer himself was quite happy, he turned back, nestling back into his scooter.

The first time I saw it, I didn't understand, but now... now I saw that what were at first glance rolls of skin, were in fact lips, pale, but with the occasional, thick tongue poking out to lick and slather the area with drool. I went stiff, as I turned and walked.

I wish I was someone who experienced fear like the typical person, but whenever I get scared, I get stiff and cold, the polar opposite to an adrenaline rush. Luckily, though, it seemed no one noticed. The store was otherwise quiet, not even a minute after what had happened at Register 3, I clocked off for a 15 minute break.

Getting to the breakroom was a blessing, it was warm, ten times better than the shop floor, but even better was being able to lock myself in the Communications Office with Sarah, after I gave her a quick message on the comms channel.

'I saw it, let me in.'

The Communications Office was really warm, the PCs had been warming up a lot, and Sarah was looking expectantly at me.

'Well?'

She leaned against the dirty white plastic case of the printer.

'Well... the man had...'

Sarah stared expectantly at me, I felt like I was being pranked.

'This is a prank, isn't it?'

I decided to ask, Sarah looked offended, then concerned.

'Nathan, this is not a prank, tell me, now.'

I was unsure, I doubted her, but I answered honestly.

'I don't know... lips? And tongues?'

Sarah stared through me, as if I wasn't there, then she turned to the PC, pointing at multiple reports from prior nights I had worked as Front End Manager on. There that same man in the mobility scooter was, each time, the cameras pointed to his neck.

'I still don't know what this has to do with that mentioned weirdo.'

She didn't respond, instead just pulling up a grainy and dark image, from much earlier, during her shift, same body shape, but not sitting on his scooted... rather, he was standing on what almost looked like a blob of flesh, like a slug.

I shook my head.

'It's too late for this... he's probably some weirdo looking to freak people out with practical effects, some people do that.'

I didn't believe myself, I wanted to, but there was no way that what I saw could make sense in any way but the supernatural.

'Well, how about this, you get no other weird customer until 3am, I leave. Sound good?'

Sarah gave a decent ultimatum, it was about 1:36am, at that time, I'd be back on the floor at 1:45am. I nodded and then exited the office. I heard her relock it behind me.

I had a poor quality cup of instant noodles, before I got back onto the floor, heading back to my spot of work, the main counter.

Any activity in the store had crawled to a snail's pace, only got one customer through, a confused driver asking for directions, as we were the only place open in the centre of town. He was nice enough, came along to visit his Grandpa in the nearby town.

It was at 2:55am that it came into the store.

On first glance, you would think it was the average drug addict, scraggly hair, wrinkled skin, rotted teeth, attitude to match. But it was when it came to my register that I found it to be anything but. It looked like a woman, probably late 50s, a bit younger than my own mum, but without any of the graceful aging she had been granted.

'Twenty ciggies now. My uuuuuusual.'

I'm used to customers being rude or impatient, but I had no clue on what their usual meant, so I responded as would be expected.

'Sorry? What type do you take?'

It's bony fingers tensed into balled fists as it smacked the counter, screaming like a banshee.

'THE BLUE ONES!!!'

I froze, to it, I stood still and stared back, but internally, I was assessing the threat they posed. If they jumped the counter, I had good chances of escaping, due to how high it is, if they tried to punch me from there, I could move back. So, I took a breath in and tried to deescalate the situation.

'Ma'am, I need a brand name, please, there's no need to get aggressive.'

It shook, then, to my silent and unflinching horror, mashed it's face into the counter. I heard something crack, then something rip, but not in the way you'd expect meat to, but like how you'd expect rubber to.

'I... I just want some Earls Blues, darling.'

Its neck had bent like a rubber hose, craning to the side at a sharp 180 degree turn, their face was contorted and flattened by the impact, like a clay sculpture being pressed down while still wet. I now could also tell that the skin had a leathery texture to it, with a rather grey tone, utterly inhuman.

I was terrified, but I did as it asked, grabbed the brand it wanted, was handed a pair of $50 bills, they didn't even stay for me giving them the change, instead giggling like a lunatic as they hopped out the exit of the store with the cigarette carton cupped in their hands. When all went quiet, I looked to the registers, none of my co-workers had looked up.

The rest of the night went by slowly, at least, until the trash run came. This time, I chose to take the trash myself, letting my dour co-workers shuffle off to the back room to restock the snacks section of their registers.

I hadn't heard from Sarah until I went to do the trash run, she probably saw me doing the preparations.

'Meet you at the dock, act like I came in to check in.'

I've never been one to waste time, but I spent a solid 10 minutes outside, in silence, with Sarah keeping to the shadow cast by the dumpster. I had thrown the bags in, but I just needed to be near an actual human, after what I had seen.

'I saw what happened.'

I didn't respond. She knew that my reaction to trauma, fear and tension was to internalise it and to freeze up.

'I'll give you a lift home, would your old lady lets me crash on the couch?'

I nodded. Had been since I was 15 that I had someone sleep over, but I think her and I were both too spooked to want to venture into the night alone. But we didn't have enough time to be talking, so I swallowed my fear and headed back inside, with Sarah in tow.

Closing up procedure went easily, but the co-workers stared at Sarah, despite her given reason, that she was doing the last two pallets before the morning load came in. I had to actively yell at one to move from his station, to which he grunted and turned away. I got a worrying hunch that I was best to keep Sarah and the Graveyard Shift separate.

Finally, it was home time, the Graveyard Shift filtered out and it was just me and Sarah. Filing reports and finishing up the pallets was easy enough, she gave me a spare box cutter so I could actually break the tape. I also learnt how to unload a cardboard bailer, it was pretty fun.

After all the clean up, it was 4:23am, everything was filed away and tidied up. Not the best end time, but for a night where the night fill team was lacking some people, we made good progress.

It was as Sarah and I headed for her ute that I witnessed something that I wish I had not seen. It was the entity that had verbally assaulted me and broke its neck earlier, rummaging through the dumpster. For a brief moment, I caught it's gaze, as it munched on receipt papers as if it was a horse eating grass. It had too many teeth, but I saw that it smiled.

The drive back home was uneventful, thankfully, but I did notice that Sarah kept looking back to me, worried, as if I was going to just vanish.

When we got home, I accidentally woke mum up, Coal was still fast asleep, but at least Sarah was welcomed to stay the night, she didn't have work the following work day. She was set up next to the fire place and given a bunch of blankets, alongside the three person couch, safe to say, I was jealous, seemed extra cosy compared to my own room.

Getting to sleep was hard, practically impossible, before I knew it, it was 8am and Coal was scratching at my door for his morning snuggles. I got two hours of sleep, thanks to the affectionate blob of fur that is that cat, I think Mum and Sarah got chatting in the meantime.

By the time I was up, it was 10:25am and I had work in an hour and a half. Sadly meaning I could not hang around for long, having to dose myself with as much coffee as I could handle and treat myself to a quick hot shower before throwing on the work gear I had worn just the night prior. I didn't feel like ironing it, not after the night prior.

Today went by with no issue, luckily it was Tuesday, so Kyle was doing the promo ends, meaning Front End got some fancy new magazines to advertise to customers. It also means I don't need to stay back. But when it came to closing time, I decided to do a quick lap of the store.

I came up empty handed, half expected my curiosity to be rewarded with the cigarette obsessed thing running at me from around the corner like a possessed maniac. Instead, I just found sleepy pigeons huddling in the old vents for warmth and a single homeless man, who I gave $5, as he usually busks during the day inside the shopping centre our store is attached to.

Now I'm here, wasting away unpaid time, typing this all down. I checked the clock and realised it's almost 9pm. I'll have to get going, keep getting the occasional weird look from members of night fill for staying back so late to type this down on one of the computers.

Sarah is going to pick me up, I think it's going to be safer that way, at least, at night.  
I've had to tell her a couple times that I will be late and she should just wait for me to call, so best for me to finish this. I think Kyle especially is annoyed, but he left at 4pm, after setting up the ends, he's now the Grocery ADM, not sure what by, though. I should probably ask him for advice, shouldn't I? But can I trust him to believe that I saw some sort of slug man and a rubbery psycho junkie?

I'll put an end to this post now, but please, give me advice on how I can deal with any of this, if you believe me. I feel like I'm up a creek without a paddle.

I'm also up to answering questions, if you're curious about anything, maybe they will lead to answers too.

Thank you all for reading, Nate signing off.

Chapter 1,"Most people die by the age of 25, though their bodies aren’t buried until they turn 80. Somewhere along the way, we stopped living and started existing. The great trap — that relentless cycle of expectations and obligations — has made us brittle. It splinters us, bit by bit. Work. Work. And more work. We chase weekends like mirages in a desert, praying for the next public holiday, clinging to the hope of a promotion that might never come. Some call it corporate labour; I call it the death trap. “Get out now!” my mom’s voice rang out, cutting through the fog of my thoughts. “Kavir are you going to stay in there all day?” she added, her tone edged with impatience. Startled, I snapped back to reality. Right — I was still in the bathroom. And I still hadn’t taken a shower.

It was the peak of summer, and my friends and I had just finished our exams, the weight of textbooks finally lifted from our shoulders. Bursting with excitement on the first day of our holidays, we rushed out of our homes like elephants and rhinos charging toward a watering hole, eager to reclaim our freedom. We gathered in the building lobby, buzzing with energy and looking for something exciting to do. That’s when a mischievous idea struck me — “Let’s make fake Instagram profiles,” I suggested, thinking it would be harmless fun. Little did I know, that one spontaneous decision would end up changing my life in ways I never saw coming.

Before my friends dragged me into the prank, I had already tasted more failures than most teenagers. I had tried building an e-commerce brand at fourteen, burned through my savings on a dropshipping project that never took off, and ran a blog where I poured my heart into writing creative articles—only for it to fade into digital silence. My proudest creation was [Bookaholic.in](http://Bookaholic.in), a curated online bookstore I launched from my bedroom. For a while, it felt like I’d made it. But when it flopped, it crushed something in me. Maybe that’s why I became quiet. Invisible. I stopped believing I could succeed at anything real. That day, when we created the fake Instagram account, I wasn’t chasing fun. I was chasing someone else’s skin—someone confident, admired… someone not me.



Everyone was instantly on board, and just like that, we had a new conquest to embark upon. 	Energised by the shared mischief, we pulled out our phones and began crafting our fake Instagram profile. For the perfect display picture, we turned to the ever-reliable treasure trove — Pinterest.

As we scrolled, something stopped me. A single image. A girl, mid-laugh, her eyes closed, a few strands of hair swept across her cheek by the wind. She wasn’t exaggerated like those heavily filtered influencers—she was natural, effortlessly magnetic. There was a kind of rawness in her that made my chest tighten. I couldn’t look away.

“This one,” I said, holding up the image.

Kabir whistled. “Dude. If she was real, I’d marry her.”

Neel smirked. “Probably AI. Or some Russian model.”

But I didn’t laugh with them. I felt… odd. A strange pulse beneath my skin. The kind of ache you feel when you glimpse something you didn’t know you were missing. But I forced the feeling down. We named her Rhea Dsouza, gave her a soft, artsy bio: “dreamer ✨ | painter 🎨 | coffee addict ☕ | 19 | Goa 💛.” Just enough fiction to make her believable. I uploaded the photo and watched our creation come to life.

Within hours, she had followers. Boys from our college started liking her photos, replying to her stories. She was beautiful, mysterious, and apparently, irresistible. The DMs began trickling in—compliments, emojis, a few flirty attempts. At first, it was hilarious. We took turns replying, saying the dumbest things, making bets on who would fall hardest. It was all a game.

But slowly, something shifted. The others lost interest after a few days. Rishi got caught sneaking out and was grounded. Neel moved on to simping over a new crush. Kabir was busy on a family road trip. But me? I stayed. I logged into the account more frequently than I checked my own. I started posting curated stories, writing captions that sounded poetic and deep. People responded. They listened. They cared. Nobody ever cared about me that way. Not the real me. I was just another forgettable face in a sea of average. But Anaisha? She was admired. She was wanted. And slowly, I started to feel more myself when I was her. It was intoxicating. Every like, every message, every digital interaction—it filled the silence in my life.

One night, curiosity got the better of me. I reverse image searched the original photo. I told myself it was just for fun. Just to see where it came from. But when the results loaded, my breath caught in my throat.

She was real.

Her name was Anaisha Shah. An art student from Pune. She had a blog called “Brushstrokes & Breaths.” Her real Instagram was linked. Private, but her profile picture matched. Her name. Her face. Her life—it all existed. And I had been parading around inside it like a thief in someone else’s home. I should have deleted everything right then. Logged out. Disappeared. But I didn’t. I followed her real account from a dummy profile. No messages. No likes. Just silent observation. I told myself it wasn’t stalking. I was only watching. Admiring, even. There’s no harm in admiring someone, right? Except admiration has a way of mutating into obsession when left unchecked.

I began studying her. Her art, her captions, her friends. She always wrote in lowercase, like her words were too delicate to shout. Her paintings were abstract and filled with emotion—colorful grief in motion. She posted pictures of her journal, her coffee cups, her favorite corner in her room where she painted late at night. It felt… personal. And I started to know things about her that I had no right to know.

One evening, a guy left a weird comment on one of her paintings. It was suggestive, uncomfortable. She didn’t reply. But I noticed. I used the fake Anaisha account to message him from another direction, anonymously, hinting that someone was watching. He blocked her the next day. She never knew why. But I did. I told myself I was doing something good. I was protecting her. That was the beginning of the lie I would eventually start believing. That I wasn’t a predator. That I wasn’t doing harm. That I was some kind of invisible guardian—keeping the wolves at bay while she painted in peace.

I began justifying more and more of it. I tracked the places she visited through geotags. I guessed her university schedule based on what days she posted stories from campus. I wrote fake poetry and posted it on “her” account—poems I had written late at night, too scared to share under my own name. People messaged her saying she was brave. That she had touched them. That she made them feel seen.

But nobody saw me.

And that’s how it all started. With a prank. A pretty picture. A moment of boredom that spiraled into something darker. I didn’t know then how deep I would go, how much I would lose, or what it would cost me to come back.

Looking back now, I don’t even know what scared me more—the fact that I was pretending to be someone else, or the fact that I felt more real while doing it.

•	Function over form: A bit of style is fine, but performance and reliability are the deal‑breaker. 
•	Buying local: I’ll be purchasing through an on‑site dealer who can handle service, parts, and warranty directly.

⸻

The Contenders

1.	⁠Profitec Pro 300 – ~€1,550 •	Dual boiler setup for true temperature stability and simultaneous brewing/steaming 
•	Fast heat‑up, ready in just a few minutes 
•	According to my dealer, it’s ideal for my usage profile 
•	Only available in black now; they’re checking if any silver units can still be sourced
2.	⁠Profitec Pro 400 – ~€1,480 •	Heat‑exchanger (two‑circuit) rather than dual boiler •	Larger single boiler means slightly longer heat‑up, but you can still steam and brew in quick succession 
•	Great for milk‑forward drinks and looks fantastic 
•	In stock and ready to go
3.	⁠Profitec Ride – ~€2,200 
•	Does everything I need (and more) with top‑tier build and aesthetics 
•	Also readily available, but at a €700 premium—wondering if that extra spend is really justified

⸻

My Questions 
•	Dual boiler vs. heat‑exchanger: How big is the real‑world difference for home use, especially if I need a quick morning shot? 
•	Everyday usability: Any tips on maintenance, reliability, or quirks you’ve experienced with these three models? 
•	Value: Would you stretch to the Ride, or is one of the Pro models a smarter buy?

Shin’ichi Yamamoto writes about the history of Japanese emigration to Brazil,"*Synopsis: In today’s  (#57) post on “The New Human Revolution, Volume I” (pp. 247-255), Shin’ichi conveys the long and very painful history of Japanese emigration to Brazil. Brazil sought out new cheap supplies of agricultural labor with the end of slavery in 1888, the collapse of the international coffee market in 1897, and the spread of yellow fever and malaria. The conditions that awaited those who decided to emigrate were harsh beyond imagination.

Shin’ichi states:

>Gradually, however, a few Japanese immigrants did manage to work their way up, toiling in earnest silence under extremely harsh circumstances, advancing from employed laborer to contract laborer and eventually becoming independent farmers who owned their own land. Later, too, some of them would establish businesses that came to be known as *colônía*.

However, conditions worsened after a military coup d’etat in 1930 promoted nationalistic and anti-Japanese policies. Then in 1941 Brazil severed diplomatic ties with Japan and later declared war. After the war many conspiracy theories divided the Japanese community with an extremist and terrorist camp believing a rumor that Japan had won the war. Immigration began again after the war but newcomers now increasingly were technicians who rapidly rose in Brazilian society status; discord arose between those from the older and newer waves of immigration.

What is the relevance of this discussion to Longhouse Elem? This 90-year historical snapshot, multiplied by a factor of several hundred years, provides a lens to understand the generational trauma experienced by many of our families. From the outside our kids seem like happy and adorable children like any others. But buried deep within—even to the level of epigenetics—are all sorts of glass ceilings and triggers.

Bernie and I have discussed this many times and we are always on the lookout. When a behavior issue manifests itself, is it just a passing moment or is it trauma-related? How can we purposefully create a rhythm of learning so powerful that trauma simply cannot catch up?

In 2002 Daisaku Ikeda wrote an [education proposal](https://www.daisakuikeda.org/sub/resources/works/props/educ-proposal-2000-main.html) analyzing disturbing situations in Japanese schools and providing pathways to addressing the future. Students had committed incidents of meaningless violence and there was a disturbing trend of poor classroom behavior. In addition, there were widespread occurrences of student absenteeism, a decline in academic achievement, an aversion to studying difficult subjects such as math and science.

>I would refer to this situation as a “flight from learning.” I don’t think it would be overdramatic to describe this trend as the defeat of education, the failure of our education system to fulfill its essential function—namely, the provision of the spiritual nourishment that enables us to develop our creativity through learning from the wisdom of our predecessors and thereby gain access to the common cultural assets that humankind passes down from generation to generation.

I will be sure to come back to this proposal again and again. “The flight from learning” has taken deep root in American schools and culture. There is a wide divide between the education provided to “elites” and that for “everyone else.” I am convinced that our small Longhouse Elem school must find a path over, under, around, or through this morass.

For now I want to study more deeply the [history of Japanese migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_immigration_in_Brazil) which has culminated in a very successful model of cultural and economic integration. Longhouse Elem is ready to learn!

It was a slender thing, its trunk delicate and its branches reaching unsurely towards the sky. Yet, every time the wind whispered through, it danced rather than fought, bending gracefully with each gust. 

As I sat there sipping my coffee, it struck me how much we could learn from this resilient little tree. It didn't stand rigid against the winds, nor did it seek to uproot itself in defiance. Instead, it welcomed the breeze as an old friend, knowing it was these gentle challenges that strengthened its roots and broadened its reach.

In a world that often tells us to stand firm, maybe there's another way. Perhaps, like the sapling, embracing our moments of gentle resilience can be our strength. We might sway, we might bend, but in doing so, we grow. Each breeze that comes our way is not an adversary, but part of our journey. And perhaps the soft dance with life's winds can help us cultivate our own inner garden of peace and strength. 🌱

So when I shop for a foundation for myself - off duty, on set or just grabbing a coffee - I want something that’s not fussy, won’t melt under pressure and still lets my skin look like skin. I have combination skin and after a lot of trial and error and accidentally taking flash photos with the wrong base… these are the three that I actually reach for:First off the [PUR 4-in-1 Love Your Selfie](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B07VPT3PFV2) foundation! I picked it up on a whim mostly because the name felt a little too on the nose but it genuinely shocked me. It's full coverage but doesn’t scream foundation and it blurs my pores better than half the primers I’ve tried. What I love is that I don’t have to layer concealer over it- it just does the job. I’ve worn this under hot lights and through long shoots and it holds up with this kinda smooth, lived in finish that doesn’t cake or crack. Plus it has this soft satin glow that looks like I’ve actually slept (rare).



Then there’s the [Shiseido Synchro Skin.](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B07YD89XNG) This one’s fancy but it earns its price. I’ve worn it through runway rehearsals, airport runs and one particularly sweaty beach shoot and it legit holds up. It does this weirdly smart thing where it adjusts to your skin over the day, like it knows when you’re getting oily and just… recalibrates? No blotting needed. I also love that it feels breathable. I can wear it for 10 hours. It has SPF too which is nice when you’re running between castings and don’t want to layer extra sunscreen.



And finally the [Morphe Lightform](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B0D88XMFJG). This one’s such a sleeper. It’s the foundation I toss in my bag when I’m not trying too hard but still want to look alive. The texture is so easy. Blends like a dream and gives that fresh, skin but smoother look without shouting for attention. I’ve worn it with nothing but a dab of lip oil and mascara and people ask what’s on my skin.

👉 CONTINUE READING 👈

# 



**Chapter 1**

After seven years of being Dante’s Luna, we finally had our first child.

When I brought him the prenatal report, beaming with joy, he frowned and asked me: “Whose child is this?”

I was stunned. “It’s yours.”

“We’ve been married for seven years and never had a child. I go on business trip for two months, and suddenly you’re expecting a child? Do you think I am a fool?”

His words chilled me to the core.

The child was already two months old, so the timing should make sense to him.

Off to the side, his mother Aveline sneered coldly. “No wonder why you’re always out late at night. So that’s where you’ve been—seeing another man.”

The truth was, I had been working overtime most nights. Their accusations pushed me to tears.

In the end, I told him, “If you don’t believe me, then let’s go to the pack doctor and do a paternity test.”

To my surprise, Dante agreed without hesitation.

I was deeply disappointed. The moment we finished the test that day, I packed up and went back to my parents’ old pack.

The results would take three days. Dante and I agreed to meet at the pack doctor’s office when they were ready.

If the child turned out to be his, he would give me a public apology.

If not, he’d sever our mate bond, and I’d leave with nothing. No money, no title.

During those three days, Dante didn’t contact me even once.

Furious and shattered, I told my mom that once we got the results, I’d terminate the pregnancy, reject him, serve the mate bond, and leave him for good.

My mom tried to calm me down. She told me to give him another chance.

“Dante loves you like his life. You’ve been together so long, but couldn’t get a kid, and he never complained about it. Now you’re suddenly carrying a child—it’s normal for him to be suspicious.”

“Just wait. When the results come out, he’s going to hit himself for ever doubting you.”

She wasn’t wrong. Dante did have a temper, but he truly loved me.

So I decided to listen to her and give him another chance.

But on the day we were supposed to meet, I overslept.

Just as I was about to head out, the doorbell rang.

I opened the door and saw Dante standing there.

I thought he had come to pick me up after realizing his mistake.

“Dante, you saw the results, right? I never—”

Before I could finish, he hit me in the face.

He hit me so hard that the blow made my vision go black. Blood filled my mouth, and a ringing buzzed in my ears.

I looked up at him, disbelief written all over my face.

“Dante, are you out of your mind?!”

—Smack.

Another slap.

I stumbled back a few steps and fell to the floor, hitting the table behind me.

With a clatter, everything on the table scattered to the ground.

The noise brought my mom rushing out from the bedroom. She screamed and hurried to help me up.

“Dante, how dare you hit her?!”

“She deserves it.” Dante’s eyes were bloodshot as he grabbed a tissue box from the coffee table and hurled it at me. “Renna, you cheated on me. I’m going to beat you to death, you filthy woman.”

I grabbed my mom and ducked out of the way just as the tissue box flew past us.

What was he saying?

Did that mean the results said the child wasn’t his?

I cried out, “I’ve never been with anyone else. There must be a mistake!”

“Mistake?” Dante growled through gritted teeth as he pulled out his phone and threw it at me. “The evidence is clear. There’s no mistake.”



**Chapter 2**

I picked up Dante’s phone and looked at the screen.

It showed a chat between him and Alpha Xander’s Luna, Sienna.

Xander was Dante’s friend and the Alpha of the neighboring pack.

I’d met Sienna a few times at the Alpha Ball, so we could be considered acquaintances.

In the messages, Sienna told Dante that I was having an affair with Xander.

At first, Dante didn’t believe her until she sent a photo.

It was a photo of a pair of lacy panties.

They looked familiar. I’d worn them the night before Dante left on his last trip.

Thinking it might be a misunderstanding, I quickly explained, “Dante, those aren’t mine.”

But hearing that only made him angrier.

He stormed over, snatched the phone from my hand, tapped the screen a couple of times, then grabbed my hair and shoved the phone right in front of my eyes.

“Take a good look. If they’re not yours, then whose are they?”

On the screen was another photo. This time, one side of the panties had the words “Dante only” embroidered on them.

My mind went blank, and my face turned pale.

“T-That’s impossible. I threw them away after showing them to you. How could they possibly...”

Then I remembered—Dante’s mother, Aveline, had a strange habit of wearing my clothes without permission.

Once, I came home early and found her standing topless in front of my closet, picking through my wardrobe.

When I asked her about it, she claimed she’d walked into the wrong room.

After she left, I noticed one of my lace panties on the floor.

Could it have been Aveline who wore them?

I looked up at Dante and said, “I know who wore them—it was your mother.”

“How dare you!” Dante exploded and hit me hard in the leg. “Of all people, you choose to slander my mom? Why would she wear your underwear at her age?”

“And she’s the former Luna! Show some respect!”

My legs gave out and I dropped to the floor.

He raised his hand and hit me—again and again.

My mother panicked and rushed over, grabbing his arm. “Dante, please stop! This has to be a misunderstanding. Let’s sit down and talk it through, please!”

“Get out of my face!” Dante shoved her aside without hesitation.

She fell to the floor.

“Mom!” I cried out, glaring at him. “Dante, you crazy man! My mom has a back injury. If you hurt her, my dad won’t let you off.”

My father was a werewolf police. Even though Alphas were powerful, they were still subject to werewolf law.

Dante knew this—but he had already lost all control.

“Your mom gave birth to a filthy woman like you. She must be a filthy woman herself. Maybe your dad should be thanking me for teaching her a lesson!”

By now, a crowd had gathered outside our door.

“What’s going on?”

“Sounds like Dominic’s daughter cheated on her mate.”

“That can’t be. Dominic’s such an upright guy, how could he have raised a daughter like this?”

As the gossip grew louder, one man finally couldn’t take it anymore and stepped forward.

“Alpha, calm down. Luna’s carrying a child. Hitting a woman, especially one carrying a child, is beyond cruel.”

Dante turned and glared at him. “This isn’t your business. Let’s see how calm you are when your wife cheats on you.”

After yelling at him, Dante faced the crowd and shouted, “This is my private business. Even if the werewolf police come, at worst it’s domestic violence. But if anyone dares to meddle or call the cops—once I’m done here, I’ll pay you a visit.”

He let out a low growl, his Alpha aura radiating from his entire body.

At those words, the crowd melted away. Nobody wanted to get involved in this mess.

“Renna, you cheat on me and you even expect me to raise that guy’s child? Do you think I’m a fool?”

His eyes burned into my body.

I’d never seen Dante like this—a feral beast, raw murder in his gaze.

Instinctively, I covered my stomach and softened my voice.

“Honey, I swear I didn’t cheat. If you don’t believe me, call Xander. Ask him who really brought those panties into his bed.”

He sneered. “Xander? You call him that so sweet, not even ‘Alpha Xander.’ You think he’s coming to save you? Dream about it. Luna Sienna’s already got a dozen men waiting for him. He’s got bigger fish to fry.”

Dante’s eyes shifted to the wall, where my father had hung his treasured baseball bat. He took it down and gripped in his hand.

“When exactly did you start doing it with Xander?” he asked coldly.

“I didn’t,” I replied, shaking my head.

“Still lying, huh?”

He raised the baseball bat.

I screamed and shut my eyes.

The baseball bat cracked against something—but I didn’t feel any pain.

I opened my eyes.

It was my mother that shielded me.



**Chapter 3**

The baseball bat had landed on my mother, but she acted like she didn’t feel it at all. She turned and stared Dante down.

“Dante, you’re wrong about Renna. Please stop hitting her. Just calm down and talk this through. If you keep going, you’ll regret it.”

“Regret? I regret not doing this sooner. I should’ve hit her the moment I saw that pregnancy report.”

“You think you can protect her? You’ve always told me to go easy on her. Why don’t you teach your daughter how to be a proper mate?”

“Today, I’ll do what’s right and punish both of you!”

He raised the baseball bat again and lashed out. My mom clung to me, using her body to shield me, enduring every brutal strike.

Her agonized screams tore through me.

I didn’t care about dignity anymore. To protect her, I dropped everything.

“Please, Dante. Stop. I’m begging you—stop hitting her.”

“I swear I didn’t spent the night with anyone else.”

“Please, for the sake of our years together, stop hurting my mom.”

She couldn’t take much more.

But even as I begged, Dante didn’t stop.

“You’ve got the nerve to bring up our years together?” he shouted. “Haven’t I treated you well? You couldn’t give me a child, but I never pressured you. Even when my mom told me to sever our mate bond, I rejected. And this is how you repay me?”

After a few more hits, I felt Mom’s arms go limp around me.

Dante finally stopped, and she slumped like a rag doll.

My hand touched her back—it came away slick with blood.

I cried out.

“Mom! Mom, wake up! Please, wake up!”

She had passed out. No matter how I called, she didn’t respond.

Seeing this scene, Dante panicked.

He rushed over and checked her breathing. She was still alive, and he sighed in relief.

He carried her to the couch.

I spotted her purse on the coffee table, rushed over, and pulled out her phone to call the pack doctor.

But Dante lunged and snatched it from me.

“Who are you calling? Xander? I told you—he’s not coming.”

“I’m calling the pack doctor!” I yelled. “My mom’s unconscious! She needs to go to the hospital!”

“No calls!”

He raised the phone and smashed it to the ground. It shattered instantly.

“You must be calling your lover.”

“You’re insane!”

Tears streamed down my face. I hit him in the face with all my strength.

It sent him into another rage again.

“You dare hit me?!”

He raised his leg and aimed for my belly.

I moved quickly, shielding my stomach with my arms. His foot landed hard on my hands.

That pushed him even further over the edge.

“You’re protecting that child? I loved you so much, and this is what I get? You’d rather protect another man’s child?”

Dante’s boots came down again and again, crushing my hands under his heels.

The pain rang through me—my fingers felt about to snap.

“Stop! That’s enough!” a neighbor finally shouted from outside. “You’re going to kill her!”

Dante picked up an ashtray from the table and hurled it at him.

“Mind your own business!”

Most of the members in our old pack were elderly. None of them could match Dante’s strength. When they saw him completely unhinged, they scattered.

He turned back to me and continued.

“Renna, of all people you could’ve spent the night with—why Xander? Don’t you know how much I hate Xander?”

Though Dante and Xander were once called friends, back during Alpha training, Xander constantly bullied him, forcing him to buy food, spreading rumors of him to She-wolves, and humiliating him.

He once turned off Dante’s alarm before an exam. He even stole his paper, and went around calling himself Dante’s father.

Dante’s own father, the former Alpha, had died young. That word, “father”, was a trigger for him.

He’d told Xander to stop many times, but he never did. On the day they finished training, they got into a huge fight.

Years later, after both had become Alphas, Dante’s pack suffered several rogue attacks.

The Alpha King doubted Dante’s ability to protect his pack and put him under evaluation.

Because of that, Xander was appointed as a temporary Alpha of Dante’s pack—constantly watching over him, even though Dante was the rightful Alpha.

To survive, Dante had no choice but to bow his head and live in fear. I understood how much he hated Xander.

But I couldn’t understand that since he hated Xander so much, why wasn’t he attacking him—instead, he was taking it out on me.

Was it because Xander was a man?

“What a coward,” my wolf growled inside me.

This the man kept claiming him love me. Now I finally saw him clearly.

I understood why my father had warned me that Dante might be a dangerous mate, a bully in his own den.

Pain dragged me back to reality. My hands were giving out.

I looked at Dante and asked, “Dante, if this child really is yours, and you beat it to death, would you regret it?”

He roared with fury. “That’s impossible! I had a fertility test four years ago. My sperm is basically dead. I can’t have kids!”

“You—you got tested?!”

All these years without a child—he wasn’t the only one under pressure. I was too.

Aveline checked my body every day, forcing me to drink strange potions from witches.

Once, I nearly lost my life from food poisoning. But Dante never told me he’d gotten fertility issue.

He’d known the whole time the problem wasn’t me—yet he still let his mother torture me.

Everything he said about loving me was a lie.

I felt my heart shatter. My strength gave out, and I let go of my body.

His kick landed hard.

A sharp pain tore through me, followed by a warm rush of blood between my legs.

At that moment, Dante’s phone rang.

He picked it up—it was from the pack doctor.

1kr1jlm,https://i.redd.it/3ph4r9mmzw1f1.jpeg,finally passed!!!,"took 2 long years, theory expiring next month, dumped my instructor and 2 failed tests - BUT I PASSED!!! i’m so so so happy and relieved that i’ll never have to visit my test centre again, and never have to go through the anxiety I experienced before my test. If anyone wanted some tips from a person who was SO anxious they’d have panic attacks before lessons: here ya go!:

• kalms!!! i bought a 14 pack and took one everyday for 2 weeks leading up to my test. I found it didn’t take away my physical symptoms (eg shaky, sweaty, nauseous) however, the second I got in the car with my examiner my head instantly felt clear and ready

• taking breaks! my last instructor would book me 4 hour lessons the days leading up to my test, which i found made me feel really exhausted and overwhelmed. This time around, I would drive for an hour then allow myself to go on a walk, grab a coffee, walk the dog, then continue for another hour. It helped me clear my head of any mistakes i had made, and made me forget about my test slowly creeping up.

• fake your confidence. essentially, if you pretend you are a confident driver eventually you will become one. my first test was awful because i knew i was nervous and let the nerves take over. On my second test, the second i made a mistake (which would’ve been a minor) i spiralled and made more and more mistakes which ended with me getting a serious fault. I made a mistake on my parallel parking (my second minor fault) and i allowed myself to ignore it and focus on what was happening after. 

• CHEWING GUM! i cannot tell you how much of a life saver this was, and i don’t know why i didn’t do it for my other tests! I find when i’m nervous my teeth chatter, but the chewing gum calmed my physical nerves completely!! 

• not building my hopes up. told myself the days leading up to my test that “if I fail, there’s always another chance, i’ll get my pass when I am ready” - which i did NOT do on my first test. Instead i told everyone I knew and made lots of plans on what id do the second i passed, only to fail horribly lol

•practice scenarios!! i purposely put myself in horrible situations on the road (going on busy multi lane roundabouts, parking in a busy parking lot, going down routes with bad traffic, difficult road layouts, rain, snow etc) so i knew that it if i experienced it in my test i wouldn’t panic! 

im not a professional, but this is stuff that i believed helped me improve from my previous failures, and if you have a test soon, i wish you luck :))

1kr1j36,https://i.redd.it/gm7hsz3hzw1f1.jpeg,Drinking Out vs Making Coffee at Home (Brisbane Edition),"Me and my wife drink 4 coffees a day, 2 each. In Brisbane an average cost costs about $5 (probably more). 
That’s $20 a day, $140 a week, ~ $610 a month, and $7,300 a year. 

Here what it costs to make coffee at home. 
72 grams of coffee a day, which is approximately $4.32 ($60 for 1kg of beans) 
1l of milk a day which is $1.50, taking the total up to $5.82.

That’s $5.82 a day, $40.72 a week, ~$177.2 a month, and $2124.3

That’s a total saving of $5,175.7 a year. 

My entire coffee set up cost about $1000 - Breville Bambino + Breville Smart Grinder Pro + TEMU accessories. 

All in all I am still saving over $4,000 in this first year, and my coffee at home is better than the majority of cafes around me.
