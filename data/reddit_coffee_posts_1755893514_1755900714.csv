Anyone consistently grind with the K-Ultra? Recently been struggling dialing stuff in and with these smaller bags trying to get close on the first brew. I know there are many factors, but just want to see others settings and if I am in the ballpark. For me on the Ultra…
- v60 and Wave usually around 8.0
- Switch around 7.5
- AP around 6.5

And really thinking about getting a ZP6 for the lighter coffees… would I notice a big flavor note difference.

1mxjybz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ourtownreno/comments/1mxjybz/restore_reno_gets_new_million_dollar_round/,Restore Reno Gets New Million Dollar Round,"The City of Reno is giving its Restore Reno program another round, with one million dollars in new funding from the city’s redevelopment agency, after already giving funds to improve a reported 30 locations in previous iterations.  
  
“The ReStore Facade and Tenant Improvement Program, funded by the Reno Redevelopment Agency, is designed to stimulate economic development and revitalize downtown and surrounding districts within Redevelopment Areas 1 and 2,” the City of Reno website indicates.   
  
Those areas cover most of Midtown and along I80 and South Virginia Street.   
  
“This matching reimbursement program supports eligible property owners and tenants in improving and activating vacant or underutilized commercial storefronts, restoring historically significant facades, and launching or expanding public-facing businesses that contribute to a diverse and thriving downtown and neighboring districts.   
  
To encourage investment and improvements to vacant and underutilized storefronts, the Reno Redevelopment Agency will reimburse awardees for 50% of their eligible costs up to $50,000 for exterior facade improvements and $50,000 for interior tenant improvements. Matching funds for facade and tenant improvements can be combined up to a total of no more than $99,999 in reimbursement per storefront.   
  
Projects that are on the National Register of Historic Places or the Nevada State Register of Historic Places are eligible for a $25,000 bonus,"" it explains.   
  
Uncle Junkee moved out of downtown Reno after receiving previous funding through this assistance program, while Crak N’ Grill which got $14,983 in matching funds for facade improvements and $20,671 in tenant improvement matching funds never opened.  
  
In comments touting the program, Council representative Kathleen Taylor cited the revitalization done by Birdeez, while the city of Reno released before and after photos of the Best Bet Motor Lodge.    
  
How do you view this program getting a new round, and do you believe it has been worth the money put into it?

# 4. Funding Rounds and Financials

Break down capital raised, burn rate, and projections. For privates, focus on valuation multiples (e.g., revenue-based).

**Funding History:**

|Round|Amount|Date|Investors/Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Seed|$150K|2019|Y Combinator.|
|Venture (Unknown)|\~$3.35M total prior|2021-2023|Soma Capital, Asymmetry Ventures, etc.; includes $300K in 2021. |

**Valuation Analysis:** 161x revenue multiple (high vs. foodtech peers at 20-50x); $66.7M cap potentially overvalued given losses but justified by growth. 

**Use of Funds:** R&D, hiring engineers, production, IP, reserves.  
**Sources:** PitchBook, Crunchbase, Wefunder filings. 

# 5. Risks and Legal/Regulatory

Be thorough—privates are illiquid and high-risk.

**Key Risks:**

* **Market:** Labor adoption barriers; competition from incumbents; economic sensitivity in restaurants.
* **Operational:** Hardware integration challenges; scaling production; early tech reliability.
* **Legal:** IP pending; no major disputes; food safety regs apply.

Back in December of last year I was prescribed azithromycin (500 mg daily) for an infection. Because I know it can irritate the stomach, I only took 250 mg to test my reaction. The first dose was fine, but after the second or third dose I developed a really sharp, localized pain in the center of my upper abdomen (just above the belly button). The pain didn’t spread anywhere else and I didn’t have other symptoms. It would come for like a minute and go away and then start again in a cycle. This would last anywhere between 1-4 hours. I also stopped the antibiotic because it caused me too much pain and I simply refused to take it (yes, I know you should make sure to complete your course of antibiotics). 

Since then, the same intense pain has been reoccurring once or twice every few months without a clear trigger. Most of the time I assumed it was gas pain.

It happened again about 2–3 weeks ago, and at that time I thought it might be due to an iron pill I had started. I stopped the iron pill, but today the pain came back even though I haven’t taken it again.

Whenever it happens (like right now lol), I take Buscopan (either 10mg or 20mg), Simethicone chewable tablet (40mg), and sometimes one Rennie chewable antacid.   

My mom has had enough of these episodes and will be taking me to the hospital soon I think.

I did walk, alot. Around 15k- 20k steps a day. 

My takeaways(not food) from the 10 days;

ELECTROLYTES.

I took additional multivitamins and omega 3, with my 2 black coffees in the morning.

MORE ELECTROLYTES.

Keep busy, walking, reading or gaming, whatever it is.

After day 3 you're not hungry anymore, if you are hungry then you're not keeping yourself occupied.

You become strangely Zen in your decision making, everything has weight, figuratively speaking, Its hard to explain? (Anyone know what I'm talking about?)

Inflammation, redness and swelling completely disappeared from my skin.

Water intake is very important but dont drink too much, you'll just wash away electrolytes.

I did this fast while also smoking mary Jane, dont know if that helped or not.

DONT TELL ANYONE!! This would be my biggest take from this, this was the first time I didn't tell anyone until I was finished and it made everything so much easier.

1mxjqop,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mxjqop/i_cant_work_full_time/,I can't work full time,"(tldr at bottom)

I'm 19 and living alone (US) and I've very quickly realized I am not mentally or physically capable of working full time. I thought I would be able to because I held a job at a grocery store for two years but what I didn't realize was a.) I rarely actually worked a full 40 hours a week and b.) during 90% of that time I lived at home where I didn't necessarily have to worry about cooking or laundry or other maintenance tasks. My family was wildly abusive so I moved away just shy of a year ago. 

My first full time job while living alone was rough, 11 hour days, 15 hours a week just in driving/commute, management breathing down my neck even though I was barely trained, and putting me on a route they had neglected for months with no help. I had a mental break and quit after three months. I thought it was just a fluke and I'd be okay at a different job.

Long story short the market was so bad and I had so little experience I ended up being unemployed almost six months. Despite being stressed daily because I had no income and was constantly on the verge of homelessness that might have been the best time of my life. I felt at peace. I could go out into my city and find free events, artist markets, concerts, I could sit at a coffee shop and engage with my creative hobbies (art and writing), I even found a local place offering free guitar lessons and finally picked that up again.

But then I got employed. It's been barely two weeks and I'm losing my mind. I have daily crises about how I can't do this, I can't live a life that's worth it while also working full time. Every minute of my waking hours is either working, getting ready for work, or getting unready from work. I have no time to engage with anything that makes life good and that won't change no matter what job I work. A big adding factor to this is even at 19 I already have many untreated (diagnosed) mental illnesses, I have two autoimmmune diseases including one that attacks my heart (I've had two heart attacks), I have a connective tissue disease and chronic pain. Since starting work the bones in my feet feel shattered despite a good pair of shoes and insoles. My knees are inflamed. My body hurts. My brain fog is 5x worse than it was when I was unemployed. I think the stress has also weakened my immune system because I immediately got some cold which I still have.

You can skip the ""this is how the world is grow up and get to work"" speech. I know. I really do. But I just can't. I think because I grew up in a traumatic environment, never went to school, and started working when I was 16 I've never known what it was really like to be carefree and enjoy myself- that period of unemployment was my first taste and it's made everything even worse than it was. I'm not sure what to do or if any alternate paths exist. It doesn't seem like there's anything. I mean I have looked into things like disability and section 8 but on disability you're not allowed to save more than 2k and section 8 housing has a mile long waitlist so how are you supposed to stay housed during that waiting period while still qualifying? Anyways.

  
TLDR; I'm mentally and physically unfit to work but the only option for survival in this economic system is to work and I don't know what to do. Would love to hear if anyone has had a similar crisis and what they did about it.",1,1755899894.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

He asked you last minute and you agreed, knowing it would make you late.  You didn't even give me a heads up - you waited to tell me until I called asking where you were because you were supposed to pick me up.  

The first time you ever lied to me was because of him.  You were supposed to work that night.  You told me you couldn't hang out, so I went to the coffee shop like I usually did when I was bored.  You were there with him.  You were so angry when I walked in, as if I had purposely shown up knowing you were there; as if I was the one who made you lie.  I found out you had called into work because he asked you to hang out at the last minute.  He was confused about why you were mad and why I was upset.  He apologized to me and told me he hoped he and I were still cool. 

Over the last decade and a half, he has done nothing but lie to you, manipulate you, steal from you, and use you.  Yet, the moment you came out as trans, he's all you could think about.  You've told me so many times that you not being with him is my fault because I'm in the way.  He's been with the same woman since we kicked him out of our home after he stole from us and almost got you fired - he has two kids with her - but you still think it's my fault.  

You say you want to be seen as just a woman.  You say you want someone who loves you for who you are.  You say you want to have a relationship that has overcome hurdles and survived against the odds.  But we have that.  I see you as the woman you are, and I always have.  I love you despite your flaws; I know every mean or bad thing you've ever said or done, and I still love you.  We have overcome so many things in our time together.  And yet, you still act like I'm trapping you.  I even told you I was fine with you having whatever fling you're going to have with him, and you still act like I'm being controlling.  

You say you crave someone liking you and accepting you, but I do.  You want someone to enjoy life and adventures with, but I do.  You want someone who finds you beautiful, but I do.  I compliment you every day.  I pay for more of our joint expenses than you realize, and I don't say anything about it.  I buy things for you that I think you'll like, or that I know you need.  I've bought most of your jewelry and clothes that make you feel good about how you look.  I give you facials and massages when you aren't feeling good.  I cook for you and do your laundry.  I always make sure you have three meals a day.  I go out of my way to make you smile and laugh because seeing joy on your face warms my heart.  

You always say things like ""I just want someone to care enough to ask me questions or to reach out to me"" and when I remind you that I do, you get angry.  You say ""I just want someone to find me attractive enough to flirt with"" but then you get annoyed when I try to flirt with you.  I try to give you everything you ask for, but you just get irritate with me.  Even when I try to do something as simple as doing your laundry, it's met with annoyance instead of appreciation.

I just want to be loved and accepted too.  I thought we were two lonely hearts who found each other and could be less lonely, but even after all this time, you don't want me.  Why don't you want me?  Why does no one want me?  My parents didn't want me bad enough to fight the adoption.  My adopted parents flat out told me they didn't want me.  And now you.  

What's wrong with me?  Why don't you want to choose me?  Why is this loser of a man more valuable to you than I am?",1,1755899181.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False
1mxjggq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1mxjggq/should_i_let_this_friend_go/,Should I let this friend go?,"Hi all, I am a 32 year old woman and a bit embarrassed to ask this but I have conflicting feelings and no clarity.
For context I live abroad and since moving year 6 years ago I have met and lost several acquaintances and friends. 
Lately this one friend, whom I met a few years ago and got really close with this past year, has been behaving weirdly and I am thinking of letting her go. 
We share a hobby and we often do it together. However, she has a tendency of cancelling last minute - most times it’s because of work, fair enough, sometimes it’s for other reasons. I have never really minded too much because I would do the hobby anyway, but lately I have been annoyed because she insists on meeting on specific days (which maybe were not my initial plan and I would have gone on a different day by myself) to then cancel.
A few weeks ago she was meeting a friend of hers and she invited me along. On the day, she said she wanted to meet before dinner and then she would go to dinner with her friend. I said I would leave them to catch up and we could meet another day (I don’t want to be disposable honestly) but she insisted, then she invited me for dinner (I didn’t want to go for the pity invite at that point) and when we met she basically hunted for a group of friends of one of my friends to hang out with them (they had met once). I had decided to meet her in the first place, even though I was annoyed, because she is going through some difficult times and had decided to take the high ground. She hadn’t even given me a meeting time, she just went to the meeting point with her friends and called me impatiently when she got there (I live close by). 
Since then, she has cancelled on me another time after insisting on meeting on a day I said I would prefer not to, but I had adapted. She even told me she maybe could go another day but she would let me know (for me, assuming that I would just be available). I have to say honestly that I am a bit strict with my schedule and sometimes when I say I will go to the hobby on a specific day, she’ll adapt to go with me (which I don’t expect to, I always encourage her to do as she prefers and go by herself if she wants).
Now I want to talk about this behaviour and how it makes me feel, and I have invited her for a coffee to talk and she hasn’t responded for hours. I have tried to find multiple occasions to talk (I wanted to pick the right time and words because of the difficult situation she is in) and she seems not interested in meeting. So I am thinking of cutting her off if we don’t get to talk, because I feel she just takes me for granted and she just wants me in the picture for her things or when she doesn’t have anything better to do. 
I have to say she is generally a good person and has also been supportive when i was going through difficult times (still am, honestly), and we agree on many things and get along when we are together.
I think that maybe her behaviour has got worse since I said something a bit insensitive - after yet another rejection from a job, I said I had no reasons to stay in the city, and she took it as “my friends are not important” (what I meant was that I don’t like the city, and to be fair she also says she doesn’t know how long she is going to stay here).
This is the third friend I’d lose for similar behaviours, and I am starting to wonder if I am the problem, if I am to strict/I have too high expectations, or if I am choosing people as friends who are not a good match for me, or maybe something else I don’t see .  So I am asking, how does this situation look from outside - given that obviously this is my perspective only, I know.

Fun facts about Buzz:
- we adopted him from the humane society as a young cat about 1 year old. He still had jowls! As of today, He was almost 17 years old. 
- he often times would visit our neighbors regularly without us having any idea. When we moved from one house a lady told us he had been ‘having coffee every morning with her’ on her back porch for the last year!
- he was chased from our yard by a coyote and was found a mile away thx to social media apps and the ring footage 
- in his younger days he was a fighter outside but always a lover at home 
- he let me hold him like a rag doll and cut his nails. Never made a fuss. He would just ‘hang’ belly up on my lap while I clipped away.
- he loved licking my bowl after I was done eating oatmeal in the morning 
- he loved climbing on my chest while I read books in bed. This made it impossible to read. He did not care!
- at about 5 years old his tail was closed in a door by one of my children on accident and ‘degloved’. He had a quarter tail amputated and it didn’t phase him at all. Still was the chillest cat ever even after that event. 
- he would get ready with me every morning. He sat on the scale and would watch me and request head pets.
- he was named after Buzz light year from Toy Story.
- He was the best.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Tennis Showdown: Alex Michelsen vs. Francisco Comesana – A Tale of Serves, Spreads, and Slightly Tipsy Bookmakers**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Grand Slam clash that’s as lopsided as a pancake at a buffet. On Sunday, August 24, 20th-year-old American stratosphere-dweller Alex Michelsen (-325) will face off against Argentina’s Francisco Comesana (+240) in the US Open’s Round of 128. Let’s break this down with the statistical precision of a linesman and the wit of a comedian who’s accidentally wandered into a tennis forum.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Bookies Are Already Packing Their Bags for Michelsen

First, the numbers. Michelsen’s -325 odds imply a **76.5% chance of victory**, while Comesana’s +240 suggests the market gives him just **29.4%**. That’s the kind of gap that makes “upset” sound like a dirty word. For context, if this were a bet on who’d win a staring contest between a cactus and a goldfish, the cactus would be Michelsen.

The spread? Michelsen is favored by **5 games** (-5.0), per Bovada and BetUS. In tennis terms, that’s like betting your opponent will need a nap *and* a translator to keep up. The total games line hovers around **36.5**, suggesting bookmakers expect a best-of-3 thriller that’s less “Rivalry of the Century” and more “Why Are We Still Watching This?”.

---

### Player News: Youth, Height, and the Burden of Being Argentine

Michelsen, ranked No. 30, is a 6’4” (1.93m) behemoth with a serve that could double as a demolition tool. At 20, he’s got the mobility of a cheetah on a coffee buzz and a backhand solid enough to build a house on. His résumé includes three Challenger titles, which is about 2.5 more than Comesana’s career total.

Comesana, meanwhile, is a 54th-ranked underdog with the pressure of representing Argentina’s *seven* male singles players in the draw. (Argentina’s pride is spread thin; their women’s rep, Solana Sierra, is battling a 45-year-old Venus Williams in the second round. *Charming*.) Comesana’s

1mxjdkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mxjdkd/will_i_be_the_asshole_if_i_cut_contact_with_my/,Will I be the asshole if I cut contact with my family when I turn 18?,"I (15F) have been having really complicated feelings about my family for a long time (about four years). I have an older sibling (17), who I'll call T. I also have an older brother (21), I'll call L. My mom (50) is the one that really makes me want to go low contact. My father (51) is also kind of a reason I want to go low contact, but it's mostly my mother.

My relationship with my mom was pretty good up until I was around 11, as well as my relationship with my older sibling, T. However my mom and I got into an argument.
It wasn't really anything bad at first, but as my mom just stopped responding (she does this a lot) I started to get angrier.

Now I will say I was a little shit when I was younger, mostly due to my “friends” at school, but the fact is you don't stop responding to your child, especially when they are getting more and more upset. Instead talk calmly to your child or do SOMETHING to calm them down.

Regardless, she stopped responding for a bit until I started to yell, which then she started yelling.
And the fight ended up lasting six hours.

Now, I don't recall a lot of the details, but I do remember a couple things.

My mom literally kept egging me on, trying to get me to react more (she wouldn't let me calm down).
She refused to let T take me to a convention store so I could relax.
She said something along the lines of “If you keep reacting like this I will call people to take you away.” I'm 90% sure she was talking about taking me to a mental hospital.
I remember I told her to hit me when she raised her hand (I'm pretty sure she was going to actually hit me had I not said anything).
T, when the fight was over, claimed “she didn't say that.” When they weren't even there to HEAR her say it. Instead they told our mom I “must've heard it on Reddit.”
My Mom and T have tried denying she said that (I remember it vividly because that was one of the few times I was terrified of my mother and started to sob because of her).

As of today she's done a couple other things, such as randomly yelling at me for shit T’s done, as well as being pissed off at me today because my back hurt and I didn't want to mow the lawn (it was T’s job).
She's also shut down a lot and refused to speak to me about certain things (like when I asked about stuff that happened in Kindergarten).

Now onto my dad…
My dad is very hotheaded, in fact I learned 90% of swears from him because he and my mom fought a lot when I was younger (3-4).
I remember at one point he stormed off, went in his car, and drove off because I didn't want to clean something (when I was like 12).
He also doesn't react patiently when people mess up, a year ago he screamed at my mom, and a couple years prior he screamed at T.

He's also a Karen, kinda. I remember him yelling at someone on the phone before, remember him leaving a 1-star review at Best Buy because an employee didn't help him after we sat around for 30 minutes (he asked once. ONCE in those 30 minutes).

I don't like asking him for things because I'm actually genuinely terrified of him yelling at me.
Which is weird since he barely yells or screams.

Onto my older brother, L.
I don't have much to really say about him, in fact I don't really know why I included him since the two of us barely talk. (Only talking every once in a while. We don't even say “hi” to each other anymore.)

Lastly…T.
T has always been rude and condescending towards me.
They believe I'm spoiled just because I'm the youngest (not true, they get more time with our dad than I do).
As I mentioned earlier T has attempted to cover our mom. I don't really know why, I guess it's because they hate me or something.
T also doesn't respect my boundaries and is always saying the opinions I have are “from a YouTube video” even when they're not.

An example of them not respecting my boundaries is when they wouldn't stop poking me when I told them MULTIPLE times to quit it.
Then they get surprised when I get mad at them.

T also calls me very lazy. I mean, fair, but also they're lazy as hell too! I mean they couldn't even mow the damn lawn after my mom asked for THREE days.

One time I remember they tackled me to the ground while I was walking away from their door because I “bothered them too much.” Okay, okay. Fair enough, but I was EIGHT and was already walking away.

They also keep trying to make me drink coffee and refuse to respect that I don't like it, nor do I want it.

T also makes promises they can't keep (for example they've said they'd play a co-op game with me if I finished chapter 1 of Half-life. And when I did they refused to play the co-op game).

I don't understand why T hates me so much. Like I get I'm annoying, I try not to be, in fact I try to AVOID talking to people. And yet it seems like they just have it out for me or something.

I've always been respectful of them. When they came out as trans a couple years back I respected them, when they realized they were actually non-binary I respected them, and when they wanted to be called something different I respected them.

Yet they won't give me any real ounce of respect and it's draining me.

I'm sick and tired of feeling like this…I'm tired of not being able to talk to anyone in my family because I don't feel like I can trust them. I'm sick of it all…Like physically sick too.

Distance doesn’t matter that much to me, i just look at it like a ride - side note… ive travelled 3.5hrs twice before just to go back and get this damn good chicken kiev out past gympie. 

So… Did this recently in the social group with good success and thought it wouldn’t hurt to broaden horizons and you never know.. might get a thing going here for others too!

Some passions of mine are: 
- music (listen, play, produce)

- motorbike rides - photo of my girl on my profile 🤘 (if u don’t have a bike, no stress! Ive got spare helmets and a rear seat with your name on it - no offence lads, this ones more for the ladies) also if you wanna learn to ride, i can definitely help with this as ive had my motorcycle opens more than long enough that i can supervise you

- good food (eating out and cooking myself - i don’t mean cook myself literally, that would make hanging out useless 😜, but I make some pretty mean food especially if you love meats)

- coffee blah blah blah - yas get the gist

- hikes and exploring places - love finding new hidden gems and walking

- i’ve started playing a bit of warzone once or twice a week with some peeps recently, so yet another thing to do if its your thing

I love a good laugh, big on emotional honesty, and I’m the type who’ll show up when it counts.

Open to chatting, vibing, maybe hanging if things click. No pressure, just good energy.
Shoot a message or drop a comment if you’re keen. All the best and much love to everyone here 🤘

Have a great weekend all! ",6,1755898900.0,brisbane,4,0.67,False
1mxjbx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1mxjbx4/should_you_trust_the_folex_carpet_cleaner_bundle/,Should You Trust the Folex Carpet Cleaner Bundle for Tough Stains?,"Testing the Folex B0F77BXC6L Instant Carpet Spot Cleaner and Floor Cleaner Bundle has been quite an enlightening experience. For someone like me, who deals with messy pets, random coffee spills, and occasional mishaps from energetic little humans running around the house, this product seemed like a necessary addition to my cleaning arsenal. Combining a carpet spot cleaner and a hard surface cleaner into a bundle made it particularly intriguing, and I dove into the cleaning journey with high expectations.

**Performance on Stubborn Stains**  
Handling a variety of stains, from pet accidents to coffee spills, the carpet spot cleaner impressed me immediately. The surfactant action is genuinely as good as described. An absurdly old wine stain that had been haunting the corner of my carpet magically lifted almost instantly. No waiting, no scrubbing until my arm was sore—just spray and blot. The product also doesn’t leave any noticeable sticky residue, ensuring my carpets don't attract more dirt after cleaning.  

[Check Folex B0F77BXC6L price on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b0f77bxc6l/)

**Ease of Use**  
Both the carpet and floor cleaners offer straightforward usability. No need for diluted concoctions or complicated mixes; each product is ready to use straight from the bottle. I particularly loved that there’s no rinsing required. After cleaning, I didn’t have to awkwardly crawl on the carpet with a damp towel for additional wiping. This simplicity really made me appreciate how user-friendly these cleaners are.

**Strengths**  
- Effective against both fresh and old stains.  
- Doesn't require rinsing or vacuuming after use.  
- Products are safe around children and pets if applied as directed.  
- The hardwood cleaner left no streaks or annoying smudges on my tile floors.  

**Target User and Safety**  
For households with pets, kids, or just clumsy adults (like myself), the safety profile of this product is a relief. The formula is water-based and non-flammable with no odd chemical stink. The carpet cleaner is genuinely odorless, while the floor cleaner has a fresh almond scent. Here’s what’s cool: the scent is nut-free, meaning it avoids nut proteins for those with severe allergies, making it seem thoughtfully designed.  

**Weaknesses**  
- The bottle design isn’t the most ergonomic; gripping it when my hands are damp felt a little slippery.  
- While it worked perfectly on my carpets and floors, I wish the product had usage guidelines for specialty fabrics or delicate surfaces.  
- The almond scent of the floor cleaner, though pleasant, might be a bit strong for those who prefer scentless cleaners.  

**Handling Hard Surfaces**  
For my laminate floors and bathroom tiles, the hardwood and floor cleaner did an exceptional job. It easily tackled old grease marks from the kitchen and those pesky heel scuffs that magically appear near my front door. More importantly, it didn’t leave any gross, waxy after-feel. My favorite part? No streaking whatsoever. Truly hassle-free.  

**Competing Options**  
Comparing this bundle to other products in the same cleaning category, I’d say the competitors like Resolve Carpet Cleaner focus on targeted stains but lack the no-rinse advantage. On the other hand, for floor cleaning, Bona is superb for wood surfaces but doesn’t perform well with pet-related odors the way the Folex cleaner does. This bundle holds its ground for combining effective features and an easy clean-up process.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
While this bundle may come across as just a cleaning duo, the versatility justifies its cost. You’re not merely buying a one-time solution for your carpet or hardwood mishaps but rather acquiring an everyday tool to tackle virtually all indoor messes. Considering how quickly it gives results without rinsing, scrubbing, or waiting, it delivers convenience most cleaners don’t. If time-saving and safety mean anything in your buying choice, this hits right at the sweet spot.

What would you do?,"It’s kind of a ridiculous situation. I go to this coffee shop down the way in a neighbour, and this neighbourhood doesn’t have any other shops around — strictly residential. Maybe less than 1km away there’s a government building, so the area gets quite busy with street parking. 

Anyways, there’s one house that has construction on and off and has a habit of putting pylons on the street in front of his house so his workers can park, but the issue is he’ll have the pylons for days/weeks with no workers; hell he even had it on Canada Day. 

So one day I’m driving around and can’t find parking, so I move the pylons to the curb, grab my coffee, and then knock on his door to have a conversation about the pylons. He essentially let slip that the government building employees park there, then changed his story back to he has work going on .. so diplomatically and very politely told him that it’s public parking and you can’t just reserve it (unless he has an easement permit, which obviously he doesn’t!). It was clear to me he could not handle the confrontation, no matter how mature and diplomatic it was. I may have said he’s lucky I didn’t take the free pylons on the street (oups).

Well he really didn’t like being confronted, and walked to the coffee shop and basically gave them an ear load of the situation. Even filed an “incident report” of his recounting of the situation, and emailed it to the coffee shop owner telling them I was intimidating him, being aggressive, etc. The owner of the coffee shop told me about the escalation, and that she didn’t care because he had never stepped foot in her shop, but wanted to let me know. 

A few weeks pass and I’m struggling to find parking again and notice he has his 5” pylons out again .. and I drove right over (not on) them in my truck (oups!). Grabbed my coffee, went to my truck and the homeowner comes out with his phone obviously recording me, though not pointing it directly at me. He confronts me about his pylons, and which point I see I dragged them under my truck and apologized to him, told him I didn’t see them. Truth be told, I didn’t want to engage with him whatsoever. He then tells me “last time we spoke you said you would run them over”, to which I said “sir I’m being polite, but I don’t appreciate you putting words in my mouth”. He tried to engage further, but I just drove off and I could see him filming my truck. 

Later that week I go back to grab a coffee and the shop lady tells me that the gentleman went in again today and that I should take it up with bylaw. 

While I totally agree I should, and will take it open with bylaw next time I see the pylons ..  it feels like he is borderline slandering me to the coffee shop owner/employees.

1mxj7uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstroHustle/comments/1mxj7uu/mercury_retrograde_the_hustlers_survival_guide/,Mercury Retrograde: The Hustler's Survival Guide,"Alright hustlers, let's talk about the elephant in the room. The one everyone from your yoga instructor to your tech-illiterate uncle loves to blame for their problems: **Mercury Retrograde.**

For the uninitiated, it's the 3-4 week period, three-ish times a year, when Mercury *appears* to be moving backward in its orbit. Astrologically, it's associated with communication breakdowns, tech failures, travel delays, and general ""wtf is happening"" energy.

Most people see it as a time to hide under the covers. But not us. We're builders, creators, and innovators. We don't have time to shut down for a month. So instead of fearing it, we're going to **hack it.**

Think of it not as a stop sign, but as a giant, cosmic **""REVIEW & REVISE""** button.

# What NOT To Do (The Classic Hustler Traps)

This is where most go wrong. Do NOT use this energy to:

* **Launch Your Big Thing:** New website, product line, major campaign? The data will be flawed, the messaging will be misread. Just don't.
* **Sign Major Contracts:** Unless you want to be renegotiating every clause in three weeks, hold off. If you MUST, have your lawyer triple-check everything.
* **Make Big Purchases (Especially Tech/Vehicles):** That new laptop will be a lemon. That ""perfect"" CRM software will have hidden bugs. Wait.
* **Assume Your Communication Was Received:** That ""yes"" in an email might mean ""maybe."" That clear instruction will be misunderstood. Follow up, clarify, confirm.

# What TO Do: The Hustler's Playbook

This is where we thrive. Mercury Retrograde is a powerful time for **re-** activities. Lean into it.

**1. RE-visit & RE-finance:**

* **Old Leads:** Go through your CRM. Every ""maybe"" and ""not right now"" from the last 6 months. Reconnect. They're more likely to be receptive now.
* **Finances:** Review subscriptions, expenses, and invoices. Find old debts owed to you. Send those gentle reminders. It's the perfect time for collections.
* **Pricing & Packages:** Is your pricing structure optimal? Re-work your service tiers. It's a review period, not a launch period.

**2. RE-organize & RE-systemize:**

* **Digital Declutter:** Clean up your desktop, organize your Google Drive, sort your emails. A clean digital space prevents retrograde meltdowns.
* **Back. Everything. Up.** Seriously. Do it today.
* **Tweak Your Workflows:** Is your client onboarding process clunky? Does your editing pipeline have a bottleneck? Fix the systems you already have.

**3. RE-connect & RE-network:**

* **Past Clients & Colleagues:** This is retrograde gold. Hit up old clients for testimonials or referrals. Grab a virtual coffee with a former colleague. The energy is perfect for rekindling old connections, not making new ones.
* **Masterminds & Communities:** (Hey, like this one!) Engage deeper in existing groups instead of seeking out new ones. The discussions will be more reflective and insightful.

**4. RE-st & RE-flect:**

* **Strategic Planning:** This is a forced pause. Use it. Where has your hustle been on autopilot? Where are you forcing something that isn't working? Journal on it.
* **Creative Ideas:** Write down every idea that comes to you, but **do not act on them yet.** Let them marinate. Post-retrograde, you'll see which ones have real legs.

# The Hustler's Retrograde Mantra:

>

This isn't woo-woo; it's strategy. The cosmos is forcing a review cycle. The most successful hustlers are the most adaptable ones. So adapt.

**Upcoming Mercury retrograde:** \[**November 9, 2025**, and ends on **November 29, 2025**\]

There's no history of CVD on either side of my family (my father has a terrible diet, high cholesterol, and no meds whatsoever at 82 years old and he's still very active). I workout almost every day switching between cardio on a rowing machine, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and weightlifting. 

This is the first blood test I've had in years and my numbers are not good. The doctor suggested statins but I would rather control this with diet first. Considering how I've been eating, I'm surprised my cholesterol isn't worse. 12 eggs for breakfast, 2 hamburgers for lunch, and a prime steak for dinner was not an abnormal day for me. Any carb I ate would get a heavy dose of butter, and my coffee was about half cream. I have no other bad habits: no smoking, drinking, snacking, sweets, or soda. 

Since these results came in I've changed my diet completely. No more coffee and cream, breakfast is now steel cut oats with a handful of walnuts. Lunch and dinner are just chicken or fish with sides of beans and veggies. I'd like to go back to eating red meat eventually but that would be on days where I eat nothing else, or just smaller portions than I used to eat.

What's odd...is when you point it out and turn the screen down for them, their response is 'Oh wow thanks...thats better.' but its not like they didnt know the function existed to dim the screen, and I think that once they've appreciated the much less aggression from a dimmer screen, they then too become sensitive to it, and show others.

I’m looking for constructive feedback on my resume. I have 6+ years of experience in hospitality, primarily managing cafe, team leadership, and business development.

I’m also considering a leasing agent role, though I understand that would require a slightly different resume.

**Details:**

* **Location:** Oregon, USA
* **Target roles:** Cafe/Coffee Shop Manager, Barista/Shift Leader, Assistant Manager, Leasing Agent
* **Challenges:** I want my achievements and leadership experience to stand out more and ensure my resume is ATS-friendly. I’m also concerned that English is not my first language (though I’m proficient, C1–C2 level) and that I’ve never had a job in the U.S., so this will be my first work experience here. Additionally, I'm not sure if I should make separate block to make it clear that, besides being a founder/manager, I have hands-on experience in all standard cafe/bar roles (barista, server, cook, bartender, shift leader) and want feedback on how to present this effectively. Lastly if I should make it 1 page or not.

I mimicked her and decided not to sit here in my home pining and being sad.  A couple of weeks ago I reached out on social media to a crush of mine and we agreed to meet and had a short coffee date about halfway between our towns.  

I initially pegged her as avoidant so I was a little worried but figured I was getting back out there and could make a FWB of it if all else failed and knew to keep my feels out of it.

We met again today and I learned she is securely attached.

If so, I don't review our piece(s). (Not necessarily specific to this book, I've read a couple other anthologies that released this year!)

The title/theme of this book is ""This Exquisite Topology: a collection of happy abstractions."" Topology is the branch of math where, the joke goes, you can't tell the difference between a donut and a coffee cup. Such an open-ended theme lends itself to a lot of different interpretations. Some engaged with math; I tended to like those! But a lot of them wound up on that border between free verse and flash fiction that, for me, often comes off as over-the-top word salad. If I had to infer the theme without the title or introduction, I would probably have guessed something about ""too much of a good thing turns into body horror.""

Anyway, some highlights for me included a poem and a story, respectively, with fantastic opening lines:

""Las Bruja-jas--troublemakers all--"" ""Bewitched Border,"" Lisa M. Bradley. (""Brujas"" is Spanish for ""witches,"" triple entendre!)

""Four-year-old Selka tipped her chair back and fell for a half-second. Half of her soul poured out before she caught herself."" ""Other,"" Emmie Christie.

""The Disappearance of 'Ways of Being',"" by Cullen Wade, is about a mysteriously ""lost"" film. When I saw the specific reference to Bluesky at the beginning, I was like, ""this will age well,"" but it goes on to engage with contemporary memes in a clever way.

>That last bit was the quote they used in the parade of think pieces—or rather, the parade of variations on the same thinkpiece:  
“Like an average Joe whose eulogy is full of superlatives he never earned when alive; like an estranged lover we can’t stop thinking about; like a bulldozed childhood home we dream of returning to, *Ways of Being* has been granted an indelible glamor by virtue of its inaccessibility. It isn’t quite that we don’t know what we have until it’s gone—the fact of its being gone allows us to invent what we had.”  
They all said crap like that.

>

""Mirrorcat,"" by Robert Dawson, is about a cat lady, and it's also about a scientist character who actually...does science.

And some more mathy ones:

""A Mathematician's Guide to Being Normal,"" by Sam E. Sutin, is second-person POV and not really speculative, which are usually hard sells for me. But the way it riffs on many (extremely high-level-math, I wasn't familiar with many of them!) technical definitions of ""normal"" with the mundane struggles of ninth grade is playful and bold, and I think the conceit works.

>Definition: In multivariable calculus, a vector is normal if it is perpendicular to some object or structure. Normal vectors help you define directions on a surface or curve at a given point. Specifically, they are essential in determining one’s orientation.

(I did have a slight quibble with this one, in that there didn't seem to be a consistent sense of when it was set; ""You’ve only just gotten friends and if you lose them now everything will fall apart and you’ll get super depressed and it'll be like 9/11 all over again"" makes it sound like the narrator is old enough to remember 2001, but her friends also make TikToks. It doesn't quite add up. Overall it seems to be early 2010s, shorly after I graduated high school, but again, the narrator seems to go to a lot more wild drunken parties than I did.)

And some free verse:

""Complex Alice in the Riding Hood"" by Geoffrey A. Landis

* If you use the last coffee pod, replace it. Same for printer paper
* Don’t wear headphones all day if you’re in an open office (makes you seem unapproachable)
* Always bring a notebook or laptop to take notes. Don’t sit empty-handed. (NOTEBOOK BETTER IMO)
* Be mindful when closing doors, cabinets, or drawers (don’t slam)

**Communication :**

* Always follow up important convos with a short written recap (protects you if anything is disputed later)
* Publicly thank or give credit to teammates/managers (builds goodwill)
* Stop saying “sorry” when you mean “excuse me” or “thanks for waiting”
* Double-check names and titles before sending emails
* Proofread everything that goes to clients or leadership
* Don’t overshare about your personal life
* Learn when to use Slack/Teams vs. when to send a formal email.
* Be careful with humor in writing. Sarcasm doesn’t translate well over text
* Avoid “uptalk” (ending sentences like a question) ( you can record yourself and practice an even tone)
* Learn your boss’s style (email vs. in-person updates, level of detail they want)
* CC your manager on important updates so they’re in the loop. Send them before they ask
* Build alliances across levels, esp admin/support staff as they often hold more influence than you’d think
* Avoid gossip, but do engage in light small talk, it makes you approachable
* Volunteer for projects that get your name in front of senior people
* Seek feedback regularly to show initiative and align with expectations

**Office politics / managing up :**

* Learn who actually has influence, not just who has the fancy title
* Keep track of your wins (no one else will remember them for you, esp when you need it for promotion/raise etc...)
* Don’t vent about coworkers over chat or email
* If you make a mistake, own it quickly and explain how you’re fixing it (don't make it again 😅)
* At work events, stick to 1–2 drinks max no matter how fun things get

**Clothes / Appearance :**

* Keep spare professional clothes or shoes in the office for emergencies
* Invest in well-tailored basics (black/navy trousers, blazers, pencil skirts, silk blouses). Fit > brand
* Always keep a blazer or cardigan at your desk
* Don’t brush your hair or apply makeup at your desk : keep grooming private
* Closed-toe shoes always
* Structured tote > floppy bag
* Better bare nails than chipped. For colors, neutral, light pink, red, or a classic French is safe
* Hair down is fine, but if it’s long, tie it up for serious meetings. Avoid playing with it during conversations

I'm trying to surprise my wife with a new Nespresso machine for her birthday, but I'm completely out of my element here. I don't drink coffee, so I'm hoping you can help me sort this out.

We've had our **original Inissia** for almost 10 years, and it's still a workhorse, although it seems to be getting louder lol. My wife currently makes an iced coffee shake using two **Original Line** pods. I was considering getting her a **Vertuo** machine so she'd only need one pod, but she mentioned a friend told her the flavor isn't the same. Is this a legitimate concern? Should I stick with the Original Line or is a Vertuo machine more versatile?

Also, I was thinking of a higher-end model like the **Creatista Plus**, but she's said she doesn't like the idea of an attached frother because she thinks they're hard to clean. She also doesn't currently use froth. Is this a real issue with these machines, or would she appreciate a fancier model even if it has a frother? Or would I be better off getting a high-end Original Line machine like the **CitiZ** that doesn't have an attached frother?

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks for the help!",1,1755897463.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

It’s been almost a year and I still haven’t been able to fully get better nor go back to work. I have or well what I thought I had was 2 really good friends from work. Chelsea (25f) (fake name) and Laura (45f) (fake name). We all instantly clicked. When it was their birthdays I took the initiative to plan a dinner or brunch together. I would also try to get together outside of work. Chelsea has no children but is in school and enjoying dates here and there. So I would ask and be a supportive friend. Laura has older children and an elderly dad so I would ask and support her with that as well. My way of showing support and being a good friend is showing up. I show up with gifts for celebrations, coffee cards for just because, and encourage during hard times. 
So when I got hurt they seemed very concerned. They called me to ask what had happened. I have been admitted to the hospital 2 times and put into a nursing home 2 times as well. When I was admitted the first time it was at my hospital thst I work at so they both visited me once during or after work. They never visited me after though, not even at the nursing homes. They would call sometimes but for the most part I was the one calling them. I would ask them how they were and what they had been doing. We would talk about work and things going on in each other’s lives. I would tell how depressed I had become with my whole situation. I would cry and laugh with them. 
Fast forward to now I have been home and more stable. So knowing my whole situation I just thought they would be here for me more. I thought it would be easier for them to maybe make time for us to get together. Instead they have stopped calling and texting unless I again am the one who reaches out first. We made plans to get coffee today (Friday). I had said my son has an appointment but I’d be free after so after 3:30 would be best. Laura said she had some trading class for work from 9am-2 and would be free after. Chelsea who is the one who said she’d be free all day with no plans has just now canceled because she has to help her roommate get a couch at 5 and has dinner plans at 7:30. 
I AM FURIOUS. I make so much time for these girls as I thought we were really good friends. I go out of my way because they are important to me. I even asked and put them on my emergency contact lists! And lately I have been feeling like I am of no importance to them. Idk if maybe I’m just a Debby Downer to be around now because I’m so depressed, or if they truly are just busy with life of their own to make time. I see on IG that they go out with other friends and events, so why is it they can’t make time for me? I am literally in tears as I write this. 
It has me thinking if I should even continue to be friends with them. It has me thinking that it’s one of those situations where you see who really cares about being friends or not. I just responded with “K” because I don’t want to go off on them, but a part of me feels like I should. Like you really are putting a damn couch before me? Laura hasn’t responded and Chelsea has ask to get together on Monday. Idk what to do. I just feel like never putting effort into this fake friendship. We can just go back to being coworkers if and when I go back and leave it at thst. But would I be the AH? Would I be the AH to throw away a friendship over this? Also would I be the AH if I go off on them through text? I’m just so full of emotions. I really wanted to go out and catch up. To get my mind off of things as well and actually enjoy life for a bit. But now I’m just in tears and so hurt. ",2,1755897163.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False
1mxima9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mxima9/upgrading_my_breville_barista_express_4000/,Upgrading my Breville Barista Express [$4000],"Hey everyone,
I’ve been using a Breville Barista Express for a while now and feel like I’ve hit its limits. My medium-term dream machine is a La Marzocco Micra, but I’m not there yet budget-wise. In the meantime, I want to make a smart upgrade that will both improve my workflow now and set me up for the future.

The options I’m considering

Option 1
- Sell my Barista Express
- Buy a Breville Bambino
- Invest in a really good grinder

Option 2
- Get a Lelit Elizabeth (dual boiler appeals to me)
- Pair it with a Mazzer Philos grinder (love the design, but not sure if it’s overkill at this stage)

Option 3
- Your advice

How I drink coffee
- I mostly drink lattes
- My partner drinks americanos → so I’d like a machine with reliable steam power and a proper hot water option
- I lean toward medium to light roasts
- I definitely want an upgraded steam wand compared to the Barista Express

What I’d like feedback on
- Is it worth going all in with the Elizabeth + Philos now, or would it be smarter to stick with the Bambino and focus on getting a great grinder?
- Is the Mazzer Philos a good long-term grinder choice for someone who eventually wants to move up to a La Marzocco? Or is it overkill, and I should be looking at something more affordable (DF64/83, Niche Zero, Eureka, etc.)?
- Any other logical upgrade paths I might be missing?

Please share your advice on what the best next step might be, or let me know what you upgraded to if you had a similar setup to mine. Would love to hear your thoughts — thanks in advance!

About me: late forties, mid-level reader, I read about 30 books per year (Stephen King, Blake Crouch, Calvino, various other genres). I like to go to jazz concerts here in Berlin. I am into exploring good music (some examples: Kokoroko, Lawrence, Dua Lipa, Yussef Dayes, Daniela Pes lately, Led Zeppelin, Aphex Twin, Squarepusher and many more. This is just to give you an idea).

I play the bass in a band and we do a post-punkish new wave genre. Although we do have a funk song and a punkish song too.

I am slowly writing a book since years with many breaks, and I hope that at some point I will be able to finish it just to say ""It's here!"". I would even print it for myself only.

If you like concerts, books, music, sometimes dancing in a club that has no dress code policy or you want to grab a coffee to chat about those interests and your interests hit me up!

“Can we get some music?” Lenda asked.

*“No!”* Kid Susan shouted.

“Can we get some fresh air?” Lenda asked.

*“No!”* Kid Susan shouted.

“Oh, can we stop and see the Báthory’s private requiem—devoted to Marie’s grandfather’s secret love interest ‘Hansel the Handsome Forgiver’? I heard the mausoleum is a must-see. When I get married to Lady Barronoff, if I have a secret love interest on the side, I am totally going to build one of those things—they’re so creepy and ghoulish!”

*“No!”* Kid Susan snapped.

“Okay. But what about on the way back?”

*“No!”* she snapped nearly in half.

“Why not?” Lenda asked.

*“Err!* Because *you* can’t have nice things—that’s why—now stop asking questions!” she hollered. When Lenda went to ask something else, she turned around and tried to whack her with her clipboard like a wicked person. “Err! Stay still you dirty cat!”

“Naa-na! You can’t get me! Hah-ha!” Lenda giggled while easily avoiding her clumsy lumberjack hews. It didn’t help any that they were both on the driver’s side, which made it difficult to knock her head off from that angle.

Kid Susan fumed in frustration and exhaustion while angrily yelling at Nano to, “Shock the living daylights out of her!”

“As you wish,” he said before zapping her on the arm very lightly.

“Ouch! That hurt!” Lenda smiled coyly before dancing around in her seat.

“Shock her again! This time for being a jumping jack! And you better do it right this time, or I’ll put you out of commission!” Kid Susan demanded.

Nano redeployed a single nanite out of the twenty billion that made up just his right index finger alone. A near infinite number of microscopic machines had come together like cells in the human body to form his machine body. Science and futuristic SAI psionics had formed in perfect union like man and woman to create the ultimate killing machine. At the snap of a finger, he could demolecularize every single nano cellular cluster in his body and plunge the world into the grey goo apocalyptic scenario. That was the individual who was quietly sitting in front of you.

The nanite drifted peacefully above her like a halo floating above a playful cherub before suddenly and violently shocking the living daylights out of her. The tiny zap to the head packed enough punch to make the dome light flicker. Lenda nearly died from laughter and pain as she rolled her big old vampire head on your shoulder. Then, without warning, she sat up with her eyes bulging like the mad scientist from *Back to the Future*, exclaiming, “Guys! Who needs coffee when you have electricity?!”

Satisfied with her wicked work, Kid Susan smiled sinisterly and told her silly-victim, “Good. Now be quiet and let me finish my research in peace.” The way she said it, while twisting the cap off her ink pen with her teeth, before jotting down a bunch numbers on the same clipboard she had just used in her attempted thumping. She said it like a scientific tyrant, as if cruelty and oppression were somehow in vogue.

“Hey! What’s that glowing in your pocket?” Nero asked Lenda when he saw something shimmering out of the corner of his eye. This whole time, he had been staring quietly through the window, taking in the scenery with a hunger in his eyes that made him look like someone who was desperate to get away from it all.

“Nothing,” Lenda said suspiciously.

“How did you get it?” Nero asked.

“Get what?” Lenda asked.

“You know what I’m talking about.”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

“Did she give it to you?” Nero asked.

“No. I stole—I mean, um,” Lenda stopped when she crossed eyes with Sensei. She could tell she was roasted duck. Meh. There was no point in carrying on with the charade now that she was cooked. “Great, I can already see another lecture in my future,” she murmured softly before suddenly smiling and pulling Freya’s empath bracelet from the front pocket of her ‘No Angels’ hoodie. “Ta-dah!”

“Wow, you really are a master thief,” Nero cackled. 

“Thank you—hey! You mean master borrower?”

“Yeah. Whatever makes you feel better, kid.”

“Thank you. And it does make me feel better. I hate how loosely the word thief is thrown around. And besides, thievery has nothing to do with my craft,” Lenda stated, clearly lying to not only herself but to the other supernatural beings that surrounded her. She looked over at you and automatically assumed that you were one of those nonbelievers. And like any reasonable person who was guilty of lying through their teeth, she defended herself from what she thought you were thinking by lying through her teeth yet again. “What? I’m going to give it back the next time I see her, watch. You’ll see.”

You exchanged a curious glance with Nero. The two of you watched as she retreated to her own little play world where she could admire her booty in peace. She swung it around and made little swooshing sounds. It was clear she was happy with herself even if no one else was. She stared at the blinking jewel all giddy and admiringly after trying it on and seeing how well it fit. “Oh! I need to call One-eye before he remembers to block me. I bet I could get a pretty penny for this at his pawnshop unlike the last time when I got robbed,” she looked over at you and said, “He didn’t have to toss me out the store for tossing a shuriken into the display case. It was an accident! I was trying to stab him in his one good eye for telling me that the Holy Spirit’s Chalcedonian crystal cutlery was a counterfeit! I know what I borrowed! Isn’t that outrageous? How would you feel if someone accused you of shoddy work? Ugh!! Great. Now I don’t even wanna sell it.”

Nero just shook his head at you about her before closing his eyes and laying his head back. “Hey, Nano,” he said all nonchalantly.

“Yes?” Nano asked.

“Know any good jokes?”

“No. I do not,” he replied.

“What about you?” he asked Lenda.

“Huh?” she asked while playing with her loot.

“Never mind…” Nero grunted before folding his arms and saying, “You guys are lame. All we did was joke around in the Holy Order. Well, the angels at least. Not the monks and scribes. Pfft. Being a bad guy sucks; you guys are boring and serious.”

“I’m not boring or serious,” Lenda said with a big smile.

“Yeah, but you don’t count,” he said with a big frown.

“Whatever,” she sang while returning to her dream world.

“It’s not that bad,” Sensei said while looking back at Nero through the rearview mirror. “You did the right thing by joining us.”

“Know any good jokes?” Nero asked.

“What’s a joke?” Sensei asked sort of jokingly.

“Never mind, I forgot who I was asking,” Nero told him.

“Don’t worry kid, I got you covered,” the driver, Yon Von, said as he glanced back at Nero through the rearview mirror. After seeing that he had grabbed the boy’s attention, he began with the run-up, “What’s the only thing better than a Thule?”

“I have no idea,” Nero said, distrustfully.

“Two dead Thules!” Yon cackled.

Lenda covered her mouth and giggled like someone with zero impulse control. When Nero saw her, he grumbled, “That wasn’t fun.”

“Ha! Cheer up, lad. They’ll be plenty of time for skylarking. Trust me. I’ve seen my fair share of good, bad, and ugly—you name it I’ve probably seen it. But without a shadow of a doubt there ain’t nothing funnier than a dead Nazi.”

“Sure. Whatever,” Nero grunted.

\---

Yon Von loosened his grip on the wheel and smiled. They had finally made it off the bumpy countryside roads and onto the less bumpy Gratiot Avenue, which would take them straight there. He looked around and saw a few auto shops, some stores, and a gas station. That’s not what caught his attention, however. Those where things you could find in just about any small American township. It was the antics of Sensei’s three students that really grabbed him. Their love and hatred for one another reminded him of his time in Lightning Group. Ah, yes. When it was just him and his two squaddies. “Those where the good ole days...” he said with a longing in his heart all old men feel when their glory days were in the rearview mirror. The only thing that moved him back into the future was Sensei’s question. Otherwise, he would have braved a home on Reminiscent Island.

“You’ve always had good instincts. What’s your gut say? Think we can end the world, or will it continue to live on happily ever after?”

“Funny you say that. I don’t know. You and those wee lads and lasses? My gut’s telling me it’s a sticky hand but doable. Hell, sometimes we didn’t even have that before making the dim-jump into whatever god forsaken verse those Thula bastards had overrun.”

“Good to know,” Sensei said with a dark smirk.

“You know. Your situation reminds me of the time when I first became Ludwig’s second. This was also around the time Stewart figured he better retire, so he could spend time with Maddie, while he still had a few good years left in him. Blasted shame what happened to them. He’d done his business. All he wanted was a quiet life as a shepherd—turns out those Thule bastards had other plans. Ah the fates... something else I tell ya,” Yon Von said with a very sad look in his eyes. He took a moment to think about something pleasant like the soft spa music that was playing on the radio. It was enough to put a sad smile on his face. “Oof, Chelsa and her big sister. Pah. I tell ya. Dammit are they both stubborn as old sheep. No wonder Stew wanted to be herder! Hah! Was all he talked about; getting away from those two before they drove him mad!”

“Well, I can only attest to half of your statement. I’m sure when I meet her sister, we’ll laugh about this conversation,” Sensei said.

“Ah the days. Stewart would always invite us over for a proper meal whenever we came around. Maddie... she’s the sweetest woman you’ll ever know. They lived up on a hill in the countryside, we’d go there all the time when we were using the old rift station way up in the highlands. When Stew was still active, we’d always chivvy him half to death about those damned blood cookies his wife would always bring… after every jump, she was always there, with young Chelsa, to see Laoise and Stew. Dammit I miss those wretched biscuits. They were always dry but decent. The way they crumbled on your phantom suit—you could tell they were homemade—with love and care unlike this store-bought Illuminati rubbish you keep in the pantry. Dammit I miss the days when life was sweet. Fighting Nazis, saving the world, and getting a proper English supper.”

“How is Laoise?” Sensei asked.

“Spoke to her yesterday by chance. She’s a real darling—doing quite fine for herself now that she’s Ludwig’s second. Hah! The lass won’t stop thanking me or Donovan for getting her sister here to safety after what happened with you know... poor lass, can’t say I blame her. You can never let your guard down around Huns. Ya never know what those bastards might cook up. I’m just thankful we found her when we did.”

“In an alternate dimension... that’s got be hard—being snatched away from one situation only to be inserted into this one,” Sensei said.

“Call it like it is, Wilhelm! She traded one tragedy for another—having to know it was your own big sis—the evil alternate, from your old timeline that came here, to Terra One, and murdered your whole family, save for the good Laoise—who escaped by the grace of fate. Blasted Huns. We got lucky with this one. We knew where to find a new Chelsa because the evil alternate Laoise made a rookie mistake by not hiding her tracks in the ether in her rush to get here,” Yon paused for a moment to gather his feelings. “Poor, damsel. We found this Chelsa without a moment to spare. She was en route to Auschwitz. Packed into one of those God forsaken cattle cars. I swear by the fates. If I could wipe those Nazi bastards off every timeline, I’d give it everything I had. Everything, dammit!”

“Well. She’s adjusting quite well to her new home. I know nothing can replace the life nor heal the tragedy she left behind. But at least now she gets to own a moment of comfort in this bleak world.”

“Damn right. And she should be happy; you’re a damned good gentleman and extraordinary host. Eh. How long has it been since everything went to hell in a black Easter basket? My old vampire brain isn’t as sharp as it once was.”

“She’s been with us for seven months now,” he told him.

“Bloody hell. We gotta throw her a proper shindig on her one-year mark. She’s got to be the newest in the bunch, aye?” Yon inquired.

“No. Dakota. She’s been with us for six weeks.”

“Really? The sweet lass from the orphanage?” he asked.

“Yes. I can see why this might be confusing. She’s been in our custody as an orphan ever since she was eight. She was only recently pressed into service as a retainer. The countess wasn’t too happy about it, luckily, she eventually gave in to my ‘ceaseless exhorting,’ or so she called it,” Sensei said before exhaling, “Ah. Vouching for that young lady cost me more than just a late-night spurning from my soon-to-be.”

“We can’t have that!” Yon belted with a laugh that caught everyone’s attention.

It even broke Lenda out of her thievery high. She scratched her head, looked over at you and said, “I don’t get it. Why’s that funny?”

“Good! You shouldn’t get it! Now stay out of our conversation!” Yon Von said before chuckling and telling their Sensei, “Oh man. Unbless your heart. I’ve never known a kinder vampire. I find myself having to remember it’s you our hidebound blood friar is blethering about when he goes on about the final battle between good and evil. Hah! That’s when he’s not decrying the countess for her lavish spending habits.”

“He might have a point there,” Sensei said.

Yon Von shook his head and lightly chuckled. “Poor Wilhelm. You’ve been dealt quite a hand. Aah. I guess some vampires were born with hearts instead of spades.”

When I first heard about you, I thought you were a barrier.
Why on earth would anyone, choose a pitbull terrier?

As I spent more days beside you, you changed this bigoted fool.
I smiled and adored you while you licked my face with drool

As friends and family abandoned me, for reasons of disdain
You always brought me joy, and helped ease all the pain.

You saw me at my worst, and never cast a stone.
Having you as a friend, I never felt alone.

You were there with me for my best, always with an invitation.
If you were able to come along, there was never a hesitation.

I once thought life was about achievements, fame and fortune.
Then the  best part of my week became coffee with you front porch’n.

Once focused on self preservation, I couldn’t dare to give a glance.
You made me yearn for more, so we gave foster dogs a second chance.

While I struggle to push forward, with the hole that you have left.
I smile through the tears, cancer taking you was theft.

I shall keep your blanket close, even though you’ve come and went
I’ll never ever wash it, so it always keeps your scent.

Of all the greatest memories, time spent with you was pinnacle.
“She was just a dog.” How could humans be so cynical?

While life right now is hard. And nothing seems to be scarier.
I pity those who never will feel love from the pitbull terrier.



You've helped me grow so much. I'll always love you, Tess ",41,1755896924.0,pitbulls,4,0.94,False

I’m looking for some new games to throw myself into because my heart (and my Switch) needs a little distraction. Used to love *Donkey Kong Bananza*, but I just can’t play it anymore because it’s too tied to memories that sting a little.

I’m open to anything: story-driven adventures, chaotic fun, or just something that makes me laugh and forget about this boy. It would be cool if it’s immersive enough that I can really get lost and forget the heartbreak.

I saw an IG bike mechanic video where he said that gravel bikes are just hybrids with drop bars, so it got me thinking. 1) Could we just put drop handlebars on her current bike and change the needed components? 2) what components would need to be swapped out? I’m sure I’m missing some but I’m thinking the brake/shifter levers, the bars, and the group set, maybe the tires.

When I was 17-18 I had a coach/trainer on my elite team who literally was a soccer god to me. He was about 38 then. I respected the hell out of him, I got really close to him. He continued to train me on summer/Christmas breaks when I first started college. I developed feelings for him big time once we got close. He picked me up on occasion to do odd jobs with him or make $20, or even come to training sessions with his younger players as an example. I liked driving around with him and being alone with him because I really crushed on him hard.

When I was 19-20 we were training like normal in the off season and after a few conversations via AIM (yep, remember that?) I had a small indication that he might've been flirting with me - much to my liking. But I didn't know for sure. I thought it was too good to be true. We were in a 1 on 1 session and he threw it out there that he would be going to Atlantic City for the weekend (about 20 min from where we both lived). The conversation led to him saying he would be in a hotel and I asked which one, he told me etc and long story short I went and met him there. We had sex - that led to 3 years of casual sex about 1-2 times a week. 

I was in love with him. He eventually started getting more callous and not nice. I still adored him and tried to please him. I didn't want his rejection. It crushed me so hard. I'll never forget the moment that sent me spiraling and ultimately what led me to break it off. We had an alumni game back at my high school and he was there (with his girlfriend - who was his own age - who I had no idea about). He brought her up to introduce her to me and my friends holding hands and pecked her on the lips. I was devastated. Crushed. I felt like throwing up. But I didn't. I smiled, I somehow managed to keep it together. The second the game ended I rushed to my car, left and drop off sobbing. I was messed up for awhile and alternated between ignoring his calls and stupidly asking if it was serious, etc. I was a wreck. I felt horrible and stupid. I ended up breaking things off.

He tried like hell to contact me and to get me to help him at soccer related events over the years. He even offered to pay me $5000 to work in his club as a coach of a premiere team. I declined. 

Fast forward to present day (20 years later or so). He started contacting me. I talked back respectfully. He tried for almost a year on and off to get me to go out for lunch/coffee to catch up. I always said no. One day I finally gave in back in the winter. I felt stupid but I cried that night because I still have feelings for him.

I have a 6 figure job, I've had good relationships in between. I have a wonderful network of family and friends. I'm in shape and healthy. But I let him back in. We kissed at one of these coffee days. Then it spiraled into more and I've been having casual sex with him again. I'm not married Or involved but I'm the same mess I was over it all 20 years ago.

We already have two love interests who are women. We are currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter, and if we reach our stretch goal, there will also be a femme nonbinary love interest added!

1. Jane (Brunette) is a childhood friend that you reconnect with by chance at a local park. You were never that close at kids, but you have that chance now.
2. You work with Cassandra (Blonde) at a local coffee shop. She is peppy, but also has had a difficult life, and seems to be Going Through It.
3. Kusano-hime (Black and red hair) is a femme nonbinary goddess and your mentor in learning to control your powers as a magical girl

I might even be out and about doing that before I get many replies, but figured I would drop a line and see if there are any specific tips or recommendations I might want to be aware of.

  
My plan for now is to try to be downtown by a little before 9am, so hopefully I can nab an e-bike before they're sold out, since I'll be going on a sunny Saturday in August (what could go wrong?!)

Then basically I hope to just ride around the lake stopping a few times--maybe once for coffee, once for lunch, once for a swim somewhere.

Some general questions--

* When you stop somewhere, do you have to lock up the bike? Should I ask the rental place for a lock?
* Seems certain places have a 4 hour limit on e-bike rentals, which is probably not enough time to do the whole tour leisurely with a few stops. Any specific places to rent you would advise that maybe have an all day ebike rental, or at least 6 hours? Defintely prefer e-bike overall.
* What beaches are recommended that are maybe not TOO crowded, that are nice for a really casual dip in the water?
* Any sites/detours/special things recommended en route?
* Lastly, what might be a nice place to stop for lunch along the way?

  
Anyway, I'm really looking forward to it. A nice bike ride is exactly what I'm in the mood for, as my feet are a bit sore from hiking today and I'd prefer to give them a rest tomorrow before hopefully hiking again on Sunday.

TOP: Black Coffee, Paint, Yautli Tincture (Mexican Marigold) 

HEART: Indolic Florals, Candlelight, Woods

BASE:  Black Copal, Ambrette, Oakmoss

WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?

Donation scent + 40% reduced price to help raise funds for CHIRLA & PCRF

(Not associated with Netflix, Wednesday, CHIRLA or PCRF)

Wednesday's Nevermore is inspired by my favorite resin, black copal, and the strange, sacred atmosphere of Netflix’s Wednesday.  I was inspired by the show's use of Obsidian as a psychic tool - this is a concept rooted in Aztec ritual.

That connection led me to think about copal, another spiritually significant material used in Mesoamerican ceremonies. To make sure I was honoring these traditions with care, I asked my friend Aneberg Prz Lui from Coyotl Perfum what ingredients would best reflect this lineage. They recommended black copal and marigold which are two sacred elements still used today in spiritual practice and ceremony.
In the series, Wednesday Addams is reborn with psychic powers: she sees visions, follows death, and unearths buried secrets. The imagery of obsidian scrying, ancestral rituals, and sacred aesthetics runs deep throughout the show.

I’m excited for Season 2, but I also don’t want to forget that the world of Wednesday ( the trances, the magic, the mythology) isn’t just fiction.

It draws from Indigenous and Latin American traditions, practices that have existed for centuries but often go unnamed in mainstream stories.

Wednesday’s Nevermore is a scent for that crossroads: where goth fiction meets sacred materials. Where childlike wonder meets ancient ritual.

It’s made with ingredients Wednesday herself might love without the safe, pretty top notes that cover up the wilder sides of nature.
This is a monochrome(to honor the original addams family), ritualistic, and slightly unhinged scent - meant for the wearer to enjoy without worrying about pleasing anyone else. It's for people who like to explore their feelings and be a bit mysterious.

Because this scent honors more than story, 100% of profits will go to CHIRLA and PCRF  two organizations fighting for children and families caught in real world injustice.""",12,1755895933.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

I was confused if i liked him or not. He always said something nice to me, gave me a coffee on the house too. So I became a regular.
I went there every day for my dose of attention and dopamine, until one Friday. He invited me for a cup of coffee after school and I said yes, I was lonely. We talked for a minute and then he closed shop and walked with me. I thought he was going to accompany me to the tram station but... he didn't. Instead I followed him into his dorm. I don't even know why or how, it just happened. I didn't know what I was doing.
He said he wanted to talk, but he never said much. Next thing I know, he's next to me on his bed kissing me. First I said no but he kept going so I kissed him back and I liked it. It was my first kiss. I was 16.
He asked if I was a virgin, so I said yes. He didn't ask if I wanted to have s*x, yet he still continued to undress me. I was 16.
This spiral continued for quite some time and whenever I refused to have s*x with him he flipped the switch and became cold and distant. He tried to play it cool and said that it's alright, but I could see that it was not. It came to a point of me being scared to kiss him again because I knew he wanted more and I knew I would say no, but what if he didn't say ""it's alright""? What if he'd kept going like the first time he kissed me? So I stopped going to the café. I stopped going past it. I changed my route to school, so I wouldn't see him on his smoke break.
But now there's this hole in my chest and I try to fill it with other men and parties and kisses and broken hearts, but nothing truly works. I'm healing, slowly but I am. I found a nice guy that I like but I just can't help but not trust him. No matter how I try, I don't trust anyone, not even my own family.
So what I wanna know is if it was sa? Or some kind of abuse? Because I'm still second guessing myself because I kept coming back. Whatever it was it left me so broken. Thx for listening and it is getting better don't worry.

I’ve heard different things about it, mostly regarding the very forward coffee and chocolate notes. I did get the coffee flavor as well as a cocoa note but not as heavy as some people would describe it. 
I’d say something like the Argyle Conundrum had a much more heavy chocolate note. 

So, while a very nice smoke, the CAO Brazilia may not be the “chocolate bomb” as others describe. 

The first third definitely had a nice cream note along with the chocolate coffee note. Going into the second third, a little spice starts to sneak in which I thought was a nice touch. 

By the end, the cream had been completely taken over by that spice note and the chocolate coffee is more forward making for a nice play between natural sweetness and a little kick.

1mxi04s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITH/comments/1mxi04s/birthday/,Birthday,"Going to preface this with my boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years and he is generally wonderful, but occasionally this selfish/thoughtless person comes through. I can also be a little sensitive sometimes and this could be one of those times.

Today is my birthday. Not a milestone birthday.

Things have been **tight** for us the last few weeks. We had a nice chunk of savings, but a seemingly never ending series of events has depleted that. Our birthdays are less than 2 weeks apart and we agreed no gifts and that celebration would be limited. His birthday was a big milestone birthday and we had already pre-paid a big event for next week - nothing we could do about that.

For his birthday the day before I made sure the kids made him cards. The morning of I woke up 15ish minutes early, got the kids sat down to breakfast, started his coffee, and went to his favorite bakery up the road. I bought a big tray of pastries (less than $20) and came home. The kids and I then went into the bedroom and woke him singing happy birthday and presenting the pastries, coffee, and cards. Very very minimal cost and much less than I would typically do, but I made sure he felt loved and that his birthday was important.

I had to work that day (again things are tight so I couldn’t take off), but he was able to have a solo day at home which he doesn’t get often. I ended up getting out really early (2ish) so I stopped by the store and grabbed a small ice cream cake and a balloon (~$25). The kids and I quickly sang to him and shared a slice of cake before they left with their dad.

This morning I woke up to my alarm to get the kids up for school. He woke up and told me happy birthday. After I had snoozed once or twice he offered to get up and get the kids started (we knew I was going to have to take them to school because he had to work) and he brought me a cup of coffee. My daughter came in and was chatting with me and after 5 min or so I said hey do I get a happy birthday? When she said happy birthday my son poked his head around the corner and I got “Oh, yeah happy birthday”. Both forgot (they’re kids) and weren’t reminded so they also didn’t make a card. 

My boyfriend left to go to work and I took the kids to school. I later texted him that I was hurt that there had been zero effort or thought and that I didn’t expect a gift at all, but even a single carnation or a donut with my coffee and cards from the kids would have been great.

I got a big long text about how he just feels so bad and is so hurt because he can’t give me everything I deserve and how it’s just killing him.

I told him I didn’t need a bunch of stuff I just wanted to feel like he cared and that there was some type of effort. I got another big long text about how hurt he his.

I replied “I’m sorry my birthday is so hard for you. I’ll try to keep your feelings in mind today and work to make you feel better later.”

Then I left and bought myself a small ($20) bouquet of flowers and went to the beach.

So AITA for being hurt and admittedly a little angry?

Chapter 1 - A Heart Priced at Two Million

Emberly Parker had been secretly married to Kylian West for years—until his first love announced she was pregnant with his child.

The call came on their fifth wedding anniversary. When Kylian heard Azaria Mason was experiencing pregnancy complications, he snatched his car keys and bolted, leaving Emberly writhing in agony from acute appendicitis until she blacked out. He didn’t return for two weeks, too busy playing nursemaid to his ex.

When they finally crossed paths again, Kylian tossed his antiseptic-scented jacket onto the couch like discarded trash. His tone was as casual as commenting on the weather: ""I raised your credit limit. Buy whatever you want.""

""She’s still recovering and needs constant care.""

But this time, Emberly wasn’t here to argue.

------

Fresh out of the hospital, she slid the documents across the table while Kylian was mid-video call with Azaria.

He barely glanced at the bold ""DIVORCE AGREEMENT"" before scribbling his signature.

As she turned to leave, his attention finally flickered from his phone.

""That pumpkin soup you used to make was decent. Start sending two portions to the hospital tomorrow—she’s on a liquid diet.""

Decent.

The word stung. She’d spent months perfecting that recipe early in their marriage, scouring antique cookbooks after Kylian wrecked his stomach from binge drinking.

Now he wanted to serve her devotion to another woman.

Even with her resolve steeled, unshed tears scorched her eyes.

When she stayed silent, Kylian’s patience snapped.

""Fine. Have Carlos’s mother learn it. Write down the instructions—consider it me buying the rights.""

""Two million. That should cover it.""

She used to make excuses for his cruelty. Now, she couldn’t even summon the energy to care.

""Keep your money, Mr. West.""

""Pick pumpkins that—""

""Add half a teaspoon of honey at the end—skip the sugar.""

""Wishing Ms. Mason a full recovery.""

For the first time, his grip tightened around his phone, surprise flashing before his mask of indifference slid back into place.

""No need for formalities. We’re still married. When you have kids someday, I’ll—""

Her lips twisted into a bitter smile.

Of course. Kylian didn’t know about their baby.

At eight weeks, she’d lost it.

She’d staggered out of the hospital alone that day, only to collapse on the sidewalk from the white-hot pain. A nurse had rushed her back inside.

How could she admit, when they asked for her husband, that he’d missed her ultrasound to deliver takeout to another woman?

His phone buzzed, ""Azaria"" flashing like a knife twist.

His voice turned urgent:

""What’s wrong? Are you in pain?""

The draft from the doorway carried away her last shred of doubt.

Wordlessly, Emberly turned and walked into the bedroom to pack her life away.

Chapter 2 - A Love Past Its Expiration Date

Emberly pulled open the takeout bag—inside were berry tarts and an iced latte. Her raised hand froze midair as the last flicker of hope in her chest deflated like a punctured balloon.

Kylian rubbed his temples and glanced over, his voice rough from exhaustion.

""Why aren’t you eating? I grabbed these on my way back from the hospital. Heard they’re the latest craze.""

""We’ve been married for five years, and you still don’t remember I’m allergic to strawberries?""

Her voice was quiet, but he shot to his feet and tossed the bag straight into the trash.

""Sorry. Azaria recommended them. I thought you’d like them too.""

There was a faint tremor in his tone.

He couldn’t recall her most basic restrictions, yet another woman’s preferences were etched in his mind.

The condensation from the iced latte soaked through the paper cup. She set it gently on the coffee table and slid it toward him.

""Kylian, some things have an expiration date. They should be thrown out.""

Without waiting to see his reaction, she turned and walked into the bedroom to pack her things.

Out of habit, she picked up her phone and opened WhatsApp.

Her last conversation with Kylian was from over two weeks ago—on the eve of their anniversary, he had stayed out until 3 a.m., and she had waited up all night.

Next, she tapped on Azaria’s profile. The woman’s ""last 24 hours"" story had only one post: a crystal vase filled with blush champagne roses, captioned, ""Thanks, Kylian.""

In the corner of the photo, the white curtains of a hospital room were visible. She recognized those flowers.

Once, she had told him they were beautiful and asked if he’d get her some. Kylian had scoffed and called them ""a waste of money""—yet there they were, delivered to Azaria’s bedside.

She tapped the heart icon, then deleted every message between them from the last five years.

At lunch, her phone buzzed. A notification from Kylian lit up the screen:

""Carlos's mom said you cleared out a lot of stuff?""

Her friend was still talking. Ignoring it would be rude, so she locked her phone without responding.

""Are you really done with Kylian for good?""

""Past due.""

""Remember last year when you had a 102-degree fever, and he bailed on you to take Azaria to that art exhibit? Told you to ‘handle it yourself’? I don’t know how you put up with him this long.""

Unlike Nyla’s fiery outrage, Emberly sipped her water calmly.

By the time Nyla finished helping her apartment hunt, it was already 9 p.m.

She flicked on the lights—only to jump at the sight of Kylian sitting silently on the couch.

""You’re back late. And you ignored my messages.""

Too drained to explain, she gave a vague reply.

""Was out with a friend. Lost track of time.""

His gaze followed her, weighted with unspoken words.

""Next time, give me a heads-up if you’ll be out this late.""

She pretended not to notice the long, dark strand of hair clinging to his jacket—mixed with the scent of hospital sanitizer. No one but Azaria would leave that trace.

Later, as she finished washing up and reached to turn off the light, Kylian pushed the door open.

""Carlos's mom is making you chicken soup tomorrow. You’ve been looking tired.""

""And keep the driver on call. He’ll take you wherever you need.""

She pulled the blanket up to her chin.

""Don’t bother. I tossed all the soup while cleaning.""",1,1755895626.0,romancenovels,3,1.0,False
1mxhyvj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxhyvj,First bikepacking trip along Denmark‘s west coast,"I just got back from my first ever bikepacking trip! I was so stressed from work I almost ditched the bikepacking plan altogether for a beach/city holiday instead, since I didn’t have really have time to properly pack or test the setup at all. But I ended up going through with it - so proud of myself! Made it up from Tønder to Aalborg, approximately 500 km in 7 days with continous headwind.

Day 1
I took the night train to Hamburg and arrived in the morning. Spent a few hours biking around the city and buying last-minute things (extra bag, tube, tire levers).

From Hamburg, I took the train to Tønder, checked out the town, and headed towards the coast. Since this would be my first time setting up camp, I wanted to be there early. The shelter I was going for was full but I pitched my tent there. Tortellini for dinner.

Day 2
Made my first pot of coffee in nature! The banana porridge I thought I bought the day before turned out to be plain oats, so I was stuck with them for the rest of the trip. 

Then headed up the coast along the danish Wadden Sea. Tailwind turned into headwind, which continued the rest of the trip. 

Day 3
Finally towards the wilder site of the west coast, through empty forests and dunes covered in the prettiest purple heather everywhere. It started to get really windy and cold, and it just so happened that the route went right through a camp site with warm showers and I couldn’t resist. Stayed there for the next two nights, as winds started to get too stormy for me to ride.

Day 5-7
Continued north along the dunes, with still strong headwinds, but the shelter I stayed made up for it: directly at the beach and the only thing I could hear all night was the waves crashing. Made it up to Tranum before needed to head inwards to Aalborg. Finally had some tailwind on the last 10 km of the trip!

Day 8/9
Train from Aalborg to Flensburg, camped there and the next day train to Hamburg and back home.

Packing list:
I have size XXS Rose Blend, and was struggling a bit on which bags to get that would fit the small frame. I ended up with Ortlieb bags, which fit perfectly fine with enough tire and handlebar clearance.

Front roll: Ortlieb 9L Handlebar Roll
Tent (poles strapped outside)
Sleeping pad

Ortlieb Accessory pack:
Camera
Snacks
Kindle
Passport
Deodorant, sanitary wipes and other quick-access items
Up to 3 packs of instant noodles

Frame bag: Ortlieb 4L, very slightly too big, but it worked fine
Shampoo
Laundry detergent
Toothbrush + toothpaste
Lotion
Stove + gas canister + lighter
Pot lid + spork
Mini knife
Mini first aid kit
Additional velcro straps
Imbus keys
Powerbank, chargers

Seat pack: Ortlieb 11L
Quilt
Clothes not worn while riding: Merino top, Shorts, Wind gilet, Rain jacket, 1x socks, 3x underwear
Foldable backpack
Towel
Bikini
Food
Dry bag used as pillow
(Still had enough room for at least a down jacket and long pants)

Mini top tube bag:
Cash
Keys
Lock
Very small things

Strapped outside:
Flip-flops
Pot

Things I missed / would bring next time:
Hand sanitizer
Chain oil (ended up buying)
Long pants (for evenings outside)
Inflatable pillow
Chamois cream
Zip-lock bags

Things I didn’t really need:
Second pair of sunglasses
Laundry detergent
Too many socks/underwear
Hair claw clip

All in all a super fun trip! I loved sleeping outside and the shelter system is really amazing (although I mostly slept just in my tent as the shelters felt a bit claustrophobic for me). I was also super happy with my setup and am already planning my next trip based on all the inspo here!

In March, I started using ChatGPT to help me overcome my plateau and try to get down to 10% body fat. I did a grocery trip and took lots of pictures of various aisles, asking ChatGPT which items would be best for my goals. I started eating Greek yogurt in the morning and chicken quinoa ""power bowls"" for lunch. I began drinking electrolyte water, black coffee, and Premier protein shakes. Then I downloaded the MyFitnessPal app to track my macros.  
  
I signed up for Barry's HIIT classes and began going to those every other day. I also signed up for LA Fitness and began weightlifting on my off days. To put myself in a greater caloric deficit, I also began 3-mile runs at the end of the day (Weighlifting in the morning, cardio at night.) I also stopped drinking alcohol entirely. If I went out with friends, I ordered sparkling water. (This sucked.)

After about two months of this, I finally started seeing my body change. To be honest, my goal pretty much consumed my life. I began intermittent fasting from 5pm to 10am. I bought a food scale and began weighing every ingredient of every meal. It's fucking insane how much work was involved, and I'm not sure it's even worth it.

I thought things would be different once I hit 10% body fat, but my life is exactly the same. Now I just feel like I can't have a beer with my friends. Anyway, I'm proud I hit my goal, but I'm not sure how sustainable this lifestyle is.",34,1755895342.0,progresspics,9,0.96,False

Generally speaking, in sourdough/bread baking sites and online, there is a slant towards high hydration as being key in sourdough bread making.  I’ve done my share of ‘high-dration’ batches: stringy, sticky strands of gluten, draping around the mixing board, glopping loaves into heavily powdered baskets, delightful loaves with artistic voids in the crumb - big enough to store small tomatoes in (I sayeth, tongue planted firmly in cheek).  It certainly creates open crumbs, bubbly crusts and often tarter taste… but…

When I moved to Denver some years ago, I began to wonder if some mix issues were attributed to elevation. Maurizio at the Perfect Loaf affirmed that at higher elevation, lower hydration will eliminate some issues.  He was right. Gradually I found my water percentage dropping to 70-72% (using Tartine ratios: 1000 G flour to 700-720 G h2o). The workability and final product (for me) works.  A little wet/sticky before the. 2nd fold is complete is ok; I’m not keen on wet/sticky/fingers at the end. The crumb I desire is light but tight. A few open areas may be okay.

I’ve baked bread for decades - even spent 18 months in a rustic bakery (the all night hours were a challenge). Process has evolved to be my own preferred approach. And that had come from years of mixing/baking/observing/mental notes/repeat. I love the process - rising early, feeding starter, scratching out a recipe over coffee, watching levain quadruple, weighing ingredients, mixing, chasing cats, observing the rise, baking the next morning and giving away at least half of the batch so others can enjoy a rare treat -fresh bread.

So what is your take on hydration? Everyone has their story and approach",2,1755895234.0,Sourdough,4,1.0,False

Gabby's skin colour unveiled a generational family secret. Gabby's maternal grandmother was engaged to a fellow Polish man. However one weekend a travelling circus came into town. One thing lead to another and Gabby's grandmother spent a single night with the dark skinned stranger. Terrified of being caught she stayed silent long after the circus left Poland. Thankfully for her Gabby's mother was born fair skinned and blonde. The only difference being her eyes we're green instead of the brown they both held. But it was simply chalked up to recessive genetics and the adultress sighed in relief and the man raised the girl without another thought.

When Gabby was born however. Both of her pale parents we're shocked when a very not Caucasian baby arrived. Gabby's father was furious accusing her mother of cheating on him and calling her such awful names and even destroy the nursery they'd built together in rage. Eventually he agreed to a paternity test because he planned to divorce her only to be shocked he was in fact the father. That's when the secret came out. Gabby's maternal grandmother revealed her affair with the circus man and enraged her husband.

The man who'd raised Gabby's mother since birth left them all. Shouting that she was never really her daughter and abandoned her. Gabby's grandmother unable to handle the shame of the revelation ended herself not long after. Gabby's mother was hysterical after losing both of her parents and how she'd been treated after birth to the point she had to be hospitalized for her safety.

Despite Gabby's father apologizing their marriage never quite became as loving as it once was. Gabby's father subconsciously resented Gabby. Blaming her for causing the entire mess and as such treated her poorly from a young age. Gabby's mother while better still found it herd to bond with her because every time she looked at her she saw her father leaving and her mother dying and her husband screaming.",8,1755894996.0,DisventureCamp,4,1.0,False

We're still together.,"I promise I'm not trying to encourage anyone to do anything, I'm just sharing my personal experience because I feel like I need to say this out loud even if it's to the internet void.

I was molested. 8 years ago. By a man over a decade older than me. At the time we were 12F and 24M. Now I'm 20F and he's 32M. He groomed me online for months, made me feel important, and then when we met up he molested me in his car.

We kept talking, kept meeting, for a little bit. When I was 13 he became my ""boyfriend"", and we have continued to date ever since. Our 7th anniversary is actually next month.

I know that's awful and insane. I can feel how awful and insane it is, and I look myself in the mirror sometimes and ask myself why I'm not more outraged. I spent my entire teen years with a man twice my age, slipping away from school to make out in his car and go to the movies. And now we're talking about getting married.

But the crazy thing is that I'm so happy. I love him. I really do. Maybe he's slipping a potion into my coffee or something, but I get so excited when he's around and so lonely when he's gone. I can't imagine life without him, he makes me feel so pretty and desired just like he did when we first met. When I think about that first encounter, even though it frightened me at the time, I now almost think of it romantically, being found and plucked from the crowd by a knight in shining armor.

I feel like I've been tricked, duped, brainwashed, something... but I also feel happy in my ignorance, and feel like it would be stupid to blow it up just because I feel like I *should* be more upset than I actually am.

So I'm sorry if this post upsets anyone, I just... I feel so weird about it all and feel guilty for being so happy. Like I'm failing my gender by ""letting him win"" but I think I should do what makes me happiest.",2,1755894939.0,rape,1,0.67,False

1mxhn0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mxhn0e/my_mom_seems_to_have_no_interest_in_paying_me_back/,My mom seems to have no interest in paying me back,"Hi. I (17F) received an inheritance check in the mail around 2 years ago, give or take some months, worth about 1,800 dollars. I was about 15 or so at the time, and having grown up with very little money, it seemed basically life changing. I wasn’t 100% on what to do with it, since I didn’t really have anything I necessarily wanted to spend it on and feared my habit of impulse buying may drain it.

After a talk with my mother, we decided a Certificate of Deposit account would be best (or a CD, as I’ll be referring to it from now on). For the unaware, a CD is essentially a checking account with a slightly higher interest rate, the trade off being that you are completely unable to touch it for a period of time. I was fine with waiting the allotted 9 months, and so I didn’t think about it for the most part.

The 9 months passes, I’m still unsure of what to do with it, so we chuck it into a CD again. Again, I just ignore it for a while, under the assumption that it’s in a safe space and I’ll be able to use it one day.

I should mention that I suck at remembering dates. I can’t remember birthdays for the life of me, anniversaries, any of that. I certainly couldn’t remember the exact date my CD would clear. I just \*assumed\* my mother would tell me.

Anyways, a whole lot of stuff happens during the next year or so, and at some point during that hullabaloo, the CD clears. And my mother, rather than letting me know, just lets the money slide right into her account.

Fast forward some amount of time (I can’t tell you how much time because she never cared to tell me anything), and her bank account gets wiped.

That itself is a big hullabaloo, I’ll spare you the gory details of her meltdown about it, but what I will tell you is that she also didn’t let me on that my money was now gone. All she claimed was that 500 dollars was taken from her, not a word about the cash that belonged to \*me\*.

So, there I am, living calmly under the assumption that my money was simply sitting there collecting interest, and that I’d be able to use it soon. Mind you, this is many months worth of time.

An opportunity for a trip to Europe popped up for me last month, and with the goal of saving up about 4k for it, I finally decided it was time to dip into my inheritance. When I asked her when I’d be able to use it, it was only \*then\* that she gave me all the information I just wrote out in this post (without, of course, saying that she’d failed to let onto me that she let the CD go into her funds once cleared—that I had to figure out for myself).

She’d kept me in the dark the entire time, and her reasoning was as follows: “I didn’t tell you because you didn’t ask.”

Apparently, she made the plan to replace the money before I noticed. She even told my grandma that she was putting in some amount of money every week in order to pay it off.

Well, if you’ll remember, she’s had months and months to pay me back. And the money has not been replaced. She’s had the money to spend on her various Amazon packages, on her expensive whole coffee beans, on driving 40 minutes both ways to see her boyfriend once or twice a week. But not to pay me back. When giving me the talk about how she lost my money, she promised that she’d pay me back before I was 18–I have not seen so much as a dime.

If you can’t imagine, I’m furious with her, for a multitude of reasons. (Perhaps I’m looking through a lens of bad faith, but a part of me believes she didn’t tell me because she didn‘t want to be held accountable for it.)

And even now, after she’s told me, she doesn’t seem to have any motivation towards giving me my money. Just about 2 weeks ago she let me know that the 4-5k dollars she would be getting from completing her taxes was going to go towards getting herself a new car.

To preempt the comments telling me to confront her about it, I’d absolutely love to. But I can’t, not without risking a full on meltdown from her.

My mom is bipolar. Her personality changes literally day by day, sometimes within a couple hours. I \*never\* know what is going to set her off. She’s about as sensitive as a toddler but much meaner. The few times I’ve ever tried to genuinely confront her about things, she’s either wound up screaming at me or just breaking into a complete sobbing wreck.

So, confronting her about this is off the table, because I’m not looking to set her off into an episode.

My trip to Europe is coming up next May. I want more than anything to go, it’s such an insanely good opportunity. From the summer job I had, I have about 1600 dollars saved up. If I had the money she should have \*already paid me off for\*, I’d already be over 3400 dollars towards my goal.

Aside from the obvious answer of getting a job alongside my senior school year, what should I do? Do I try and gently prod it out of her, should I get legal advice, or should I just grit my teeth and accept that my money is probably gone with the wind?",1,1755894827.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1mxhlfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/trustyconsumer/comments/1mxhlfo/should_you_trust_the_holfenry_u80b_blood_pressure/,Should You Trust the HOLFENRY U80B Blood Pressure Monitor Review for Accuracy?,"Testing out the **HOLFENRY U80B Blood Pressure Monitor** over the past few weeks has been nothing short of interesting. As someone who monitors blood pressure regularly for personal health reasons (and occasionally for family members when they're over), I’ve definitely had my share of experiences with similar devices. This particular model, with its sleek design and surprisingly intuitive features, managed to stand out—but not without a few hiccups along the way.

**Design and Display**

The first thing I noticed about this monitor is the oversized, high-definition digital screen. The bright backlight and large characters make it incredibly easy to read in almost any situation, whether it’s morning light spilling into the room or late-night dim conditions. HOLFENRY did a solid job ensuring the display is practical. Unlike older monitors that reflect light annoyingly, this one survives the glare and maintains readability due to its optimal 25° viewing angle. My dad was even able to use it without struggling to find his glasses—which almost felt like a win in itself.

**Ease of Use and Data Storage**

After using other devices that felt like I needed a “How-To” manual every single time, this monitor was refreshingly simple. With just one button, the cuff inflates automatically, and the process is straightforward enough to use single-handedly. Bonus points for the memory storage feature—99 data entries per user (with space for two users). This became an odd form of competition between my partner and me as we compared our morning readings versus post-coffee numbers. The dual-user feature is genuinely thoughtful; it’s great for families or for tracking different times of day if one person is obsessively monitoring their stats (guilty).  

[Find the best price for HOLFENRY U80B on Amazon.](https://thepressureexperts.com/link/b0c5zrtjxp/)

**Comfortable, Adjustable Cuff**

The cuff size, adjustable from 9 inches to 17 inches, was another standout. The fact that it’s big enough to accommodate my brother’s gym-rat biceps and still snug enough for my mom’s smaller arm felt almost miraculous for a device at this price. It comfortably inflates without feeling like you’re being attacked by some medieval torture device. Other models have left me with a deep sense of ""I may lose circulation before it finishes its work,"" but with this one? Not so much. 

**BP Grading System**

I’d never used a blood pressure monitor that transformed my stats into some sort of level gamification before. HOLFENRY’s grade system (ranging from 1 to 6) simplifies understanding the results—no more scrolling through Google to figure out how ‘bad’ or ‘good’ your numbers actually are. The lower the grade, the better your health, and it’s oddly kind of fun. The system made me more eager to aim for healthier numbers, though I couldn’t resist the smugness of pointing out to my spouse that I consistently stayed in the better ""grades.""

**What’s in the Package**

This might sound trivial, but receiving a ready-to-use package is something every device like this should aim for. The box came with the monitor, cuff, and four AAA batteries. It was literally good to go right out of the box—something I appreciated because there’s nothing worse than realizing you need to hunt down batteries after getting excited to test out your new gadget.

**Advantages**

- The large and HD backlit screen is straightforward to read both day and night.
- Dual-user memory storage is a lifesaver for family use or tracking changes over time.
- Comfortable cuff size that suits a wide range of users.
- Easy one-handed operation is a game-changer, especially for people with limited mobility.
- Clever grading system simplifies understanding your BP status.

**Areas for Improvement**

- The memory recall system isn’t entirely intuitive—figuring out which user’s data you’re viewing can feel mildly confusing at first.
- While it’s lightweight and portable, the lack of a carrying case was a surprising omission.
- It’s battery operated only; there’s no option to power it via an adapter, which some other models at this level do include.
- Limited indicators for irregular heartbeats—while it did the basics well, it lacked some advanced health monitoring features.
- The durability of the cuff's Velcro feels questionable over long-term use.

**Product Contenders**

To see where this monitor stacks up, I compared it to other models like the Omron 10 Series and the Beurer BM55. Omron's series remains the gold standard with its smartphone connectivity, which HOLFENRY lacks, but the latter beats Omron hands down in simplicity and affordability. On the flip side, Beurer offers a softer cuff and a slightly sleeker display, but HOLFENRY compensates with its broader cuff measurement range, making it more versatile. If you’re looking primarily for a first-time or family-shared device, this one does the job without many complications.

**Cost Efficiency**

In terms of value for money, I’d say this product hits a sweet spot. You’re not getting overly excessive features, but all the essentials are here and executed well. The design is thoughtful, the interface user-friendly, and it delivers on what it promises. That being said, this would probably best suit someone who wants solid practicality over technical bells and whistles.

So, I was doomscrolling TikTok and YouTube, and for the billionth time, ""Get paid just by clicking CAPTCHAS!"" popped up. I mean, IT SOUNDS STUPID, RIGHT?—But then, curiosity won. I tried one of those “app testing gateways” and OH. EM. GEE.

Let me just put this here: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
Bookmark it. You’ll need it. Trust me.

Here’s what hit me like a ton of AI-powered bricks:  
- There’s this literal SYSTEM where companies pay you to test if captchas work on their apps.  
- The catch? They send you random apps (some legit, some shady as *all* heck) that gate the real content behind CAPTCHAS or mini-tasks just to check if their human-checkers are working.

So get this:  
- ""Complete 5 captchas, claim $25 in five minutes!"" screamed the marketing.  
- I sat there… clicking blurry bicycles and fire hydrants, thinking I was two steps away from easy pizza money.  
- Spoiler: Nothing is THAT easy. But IT WAS real—I actually got some payment. 

Then it got weird.

Let me tell you:
- **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** is now my “Is-this-for-real?” tracker. (Go look at their app aggregator, I dare you!)  
- Some gateways genuinely work—IF you don’t mind jumping through puzzle hoops, surveys, and ad waterfalls.
- The money is super inconsistent. You might get… $2 for your first 30 mins, then squat for the next hour unless you reach a payout threshold.

BUT THEN I HEARD THIS:
- Some “test apps” literally sell your CAPTCHA solving skills to spam bots.
- It’s borderline untraceable—like, you’re suddenly part of a global army, training AI AND probably fueling the internet’s craziest clickfarms.

Now I’m stuck:
- Is it easy cash or just the world’s most pointless digital treadmill?
- Where’s the line between real and AI-juiced scam?

This is where you help me out.  

Anyone ACTUALLY made cash that’s more than coffee money?   
Do any of these platforms have soul, or is it all data farming and mindless button smashing?

Oh—and before you go down the rabbit hole:  
1. **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** ← Try it for science (wear your skeptical shades).
2. Double check the app permissions. Some ask for way more than they should.
3. Only cash out through platforms you trust. (Read the small print, people!)
4. (Again) **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** – for the receipts, because we NEED transparency with this whole mess!

I legit want to know—has anyone here cracked the CAPTCHA-to-cash code without tripping a scam alarm? Or did TikTok hustle us all?  
Please tell me I’m not the only confused, shocked hyped person clicking hydrants at 2am.

Soft morning light filtered into an ornate bedchamber through the glass double doors that led to its white stone balcony. A streak of light flashed right into the eyes of a blonde, fair-skinned woman who lay asleep on a king-size (though it may be more accurate to say princess-size) bed adorned with a scarlet bedspread which covered most of her body save only her head. The Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom let out a small groan as she was rudely awakened by the encroaching sunrise. She put her left hand above her eyes like the vizor of a baseball cap to shield her eyes as she sat up, using her other arm to hold the bedsheets against her chest lest someone walk in and see what undergarments (or lack thereof) adorned her beneath the blankets.

“Where is the remote for the blinds?’ she thought, still half asleep, to herself as she fumbled her hand across her bedside table looking for the remote to close the blinds. After a minute that felt like an hour, she grasped a small black rectangle which, when flipped over in her hand, revealed two buttons, one red and one green. She pointed the remote at the doors and pressed the red button, a small motor whirred to life, and two floor-length black curtains covered each of the doors before stopping to meet in the middle. The room was once more blanketed in darkness as Peach laid the remote back atop her nightstand and took a moment to check the clock beside her lamp. 5:57 AM, the digital display read in green, segmented numerals on a black background.

“Good, I can sleep for a bit longer,” Peach thought as she lay back down, turning away from the direction of the curtains as she settled herself in for more snoozing. As she turned, she saw a familiar and very welcome sight: a short, stout, Italian man with brown hair and a black moustache beneath his large, bulbous nose. This man, Mario being his name, was someone the Princess was very well acquainted with, particularly since he had just spent the night with her, even sharing her bed, tonight being far from the first time. Right now, though, he was still asleep, mouth hanging open, face turned towards her as he slept on his stomach. “He’s so cute,” Peach quietly said to herself, and she scooted across the mattress, curling up next to him and falling asleep once more with her arms around him. Her stirring caused Mario to wake for a second, opening one eye to be greeted by her cleavage meeting his eye line, less than an inch from his face. He quickly darted his eyes (having opened the other eye) up to see her slumbering with a smile adorning her face, only then noticing her arms enveloping him. Seeing how happy and peaceful his beloved was in this moment, Mario, without saying a word, softly planted a kiss on her cheek and embraced her in return before rejoining her in sleep.

A little over two hours would pass with neither leaving this comfy position they had settled into until the clock struck eight. Then the chiptune approximation of Bowser’s malevolent laugh filled the room to jolt the couple awake. “Why did you pick that to be your new alarm?” Mario groaned as he sat up and rubbed his eyes. “Because every time I picked a sound I like, I would end up hating it,” Peach explained as she moved across the bed to shut the alarm off. “I don’t like waking up,” she finished explaining as she hit the snooze button. “I don’t either,” Mario yawned with a stretch, “so I see your point,” he continued in his normal tone of voice, “I don’t know how Mr. Bluesky became mine and Luigi’s alarm, but that song is definitely one I could go without hearing again.” The mention of Luigi made Peach remember something she had meant to tell Mario the night before: “Hope you don’t mind, but he and Daisy will be joining us for breakfast this morning.”

Of course, Mario had no problem with this, “it’ll be good to see him,” he said as he got up to get dressed, starting by retrieving his underwear from atop his bedside table, “we haven’t talked much since he moved in with Daisy,” he added. Peach suspected that Daisy had been keeping Luigi “busy” in the sort of way that she had been keeping Mario busy since the elder brother had moved in with her. Though she kept this insight to herself since Mario, understandably, would not want to hear what his little brother was getting up to in the bedroom. “It will indeed be nice to see them, then,” she answered as she pulled her undergarments down from the headboard to put them on. “So when are they going to be here?” Mario asked. “Eight-thirty,” Peach answered, “so we’ve got some time.”

With at least something covering them, Mario and Peach each made their way to the bathroom connected to the bedchamber by a white wooden door closer to Mario’s side of the bed. After making use of the facilities in turn, they returned to getting dressed, Mario opting for a clean set of his red shirt, blue overalls, and brown shoes while Peach went with her classic pink dress, attaching her sapphire amulet to the fabric that now covered her chest, after Mario helped her zip her dress up in the back. Now fully dressed, Mario returned to the bedside and opened the drawer of his table, finding his red hat inside. He placed it on his head and shut the drawer once again. Meanwhile, Peach seated herself at her makeup table and began to reapply her lipstick, eyeliner, and perfume, with whether this ritual took five minutes or twenty (and to what extent this even mattered) being a frequent subject of debate between her and Mario.

Eventually, though, the couple made their way out of the bedroom and Mario started his way down the hall to meet their guests. Peach, meanwhile, took a slight detour into a room easily mistaken for a storage closet, as it was small and the woodwork was in need of a fresh coat of varnish. Inside, the only notable item was a tall filing cabinet, almost as tall as Peach herself, though she still stood a head above it. After closing the door, Peach carefully detached her amulet from her dress by pressing a hidden button on its golden back, separating it from its sapphire stone. Within a concealed compartment in the sapphire, she found a silver key. Peach set both halves of her amulet atop the cabinet, then used the key to unlock the top drawer of the filing cabinet.

With the file cabinet unlocked, Peach opened the top drawer and began flicking through the many manila folders inside, searching for a specific file. Just as she found it, another folder at the back of the drawer caught her attention. Its label read 'Operation Unthinkable' in bold typeface, aptly nicknamed for a plan she always kept in reserve but hoped never to use. She reassured herself, 'As long as I have Mario, Operation Unthinkable remains just that, unthinkable.' Peach then took the file she needed for her post-breakfast meeting, closed and locked the cabinet, returned the key to the hidden compartment in her amulet, reassembled her amulet, and reattached it to her dress before leaving to rejoin Mario.

As soon as she walked into the throne room, which sat at the other end of the hallway from the bedchamber, Peach was ambushed by a blur of orange and auburn, which, as she expected, turned out to be Daisy, who had seemingly emerged from hyperspace to give her a hug. “How’d we go three weeks without talking?” the Orange Princess exclaimed as she embraced her good friend, lifting Peach up in the air as she did so. “I missed you too, Daisy,” the Mushroom Princess answered, “but remember you can always call me, and also you can put me down now.” Daisy set Peach down, the latter now noticing that Mario and Luigi were a few steps away, and had stopped hugging each other (and being bear hugged by Daisy) to watch the chaos unfold. “I guess it slipped my mind that I have your number,” Daisy said with a nervous laugh. “We’ve all been pretty busy recently, so it’s understandable,” Luigi chimed in, only realizing too late what he had unleashed. “You’re words, not mine,” Daisy replied with a devious smirk, “speaking of which, Peach, have you and Mario gotten ‘busy’ since he moved in? ‘Cause if you have, I bet me and Weeg have done it more.”

“DAISY!!!” Mario, Luigi, and Peach shouted in a chorus of indignation, ""Okay, okay,” Daisy said, putting her hands up, “you don’t have to answer, I was just trying to wind you up.” “But for the record,” she added, “if you haven’t, that’s totally okay, I’m not judging you,” (you may have noticed by now that Daisy found much amusement in her friends reacting to awkward questions). “If you have absolutely no follow-up questions,” Peach sternly replied, “yes, we have. A lot actually.” “Can we please talk about literally anything else?” Mario cringed as Luigi shook his head in agreement. “Alright, I’ve had my fun, for real this time,” Daisy assured them, “so where are we going for breakfast?” “I had a table set for us on the front balcony,” Peach answered, “follow me.”

This conversation had taken place to the side of the stairs that led up to Peach’s throne, which itself sat in front of the large stained glass portrait that adorned the front of the castle exterior (and at sunset made the throne room sparkle with colorful light). She led her boyfriend, his brother, and his girlfriend up the stairs and past the silver and red velvet chair to a side door that was dwarfed by the stained glass. Peach opened the door and led the others through it onto the balcony, with Daisy closing the door behind her since she was the last one out. The front balcony was a fair bit larger than the side balcony of Peach’s bedchamber, though she had never taken the time to measure, the Princess reckoned the floor space was roughly equivalent to the main chamber of her bedroom. As she said, a table was set for them, a large, round wooden table surrounded by four matching ebony chairs boasting pink velvet cushions. It was cloaked in a white linen table cloth, atop of which sat four identical silver plates, each with a fork, knife, and spoon wrapped in a cloth that matched each of their color schemes.

Before taking their seats, Mario, Peach, Luigi, and Daisy took a moment to admire the view from the balcony. It was immediately obvious why Peach had chosen this spot to host them for breakfast, as one could see the entirety of Toad Town, the surrounding hills, and the mushroom forest beyond them under the clear blue sky. No matter how many times one laid eyes upon it, this was always a beautiful sight to behold. But they were hungry, so they quickly made their way to their seat, Mario sat across from Peach, and Luigi across from Daisy, and each began to examine one of the four black leather bound menus that sat in the middle of the table. Once they were seated, a team of four Toads came to serve them, first taking orders for drinks and then for food. Mario and Luigi both asked for coffee, and Peach for a pot of tea for anyone at the table who wanted it.

Daisy opted for a mango and passion fruit smoothie, and then the four put in what they wanted to eat. Mario and Luigi both went for something fairly simple: bacon and eggs, and pancakes respectively. Peach ordered waffles with a side of fresh fruit, and Daisy requested a sliced cantaloupe with a side of bacon. Once the Toads went away to prepare their orders, the couples talked, received, and ate their breakfasts, then chatted some more. Interrupted only by occasional refills on their drinks, and stopping to get another look at the view, all as a gentle breeze kept the temperature nice and comfy. It was a truly idyllic scene, so of course, Bowser had to show up and ruin everything.

The tricky part? It looks *legit*. A polished Instagram grid, motivational quotes, flashy reels all of it creates the illusion of success. And that illusion makes people more likely to buy in.

1mxheez,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxheez,"After 8 years, the dream has come true","I've been drinking coffee almost daily since ten years ago when I was 23.
And around 2017, I discovered the world of specialty coffee, and the process of brewing coffee in general.

At first I was dreaming about owning a Breville Barista Express. I thought it was the ultimate machine, then I learned that a dedicated professional grinder would produce better coffee. Then moving forward, I learned that there are better machines at the same price range but they needed more tweaking, and of course, a lot of maintenance, and both were hard for me as I'm living in Libya, especially since the price wasn't affordable for me at that time.

Then, it happened, I discovered the Robot sometime in 2020. I became more interested in it, reading posts here, watching literally every single YouTube video, and I fell in love with everything about it: the durability, the no need for maintenance or descaling, and the high quality coffee that it can make at this price point.

I finally decided that it was enough dreaming and it was time to make it true. I waited for a restock, then I received an email from Eight Ounce Coffee, and bought it, and ordered the J Ultra, the Subminimal accessories and the mittens from Cafune, and everything else from one of the two stores that sell speciality coffee in my whole country.

Everything including shipping from Canada to Libya through a freight forwarding company and the accessories available locally, cost a total of $1,150, which for the average income for people in my country is equivalent to at least 5 months of salary.
Also, for the cost of a decent cappuccino (which I'm having every morning) it's a crazy idea, because it will cost less than a dollar but the quality isn't that good despite the time wasted and everything else. I believe that brewing coffee at home is priceless for people with this hobby.

Now to the final point: I waited 18 days for the shipment to arrive, and I was like a kid opening a present.
I couldn't believe that it finally happened.

I might be the first one in the country to buy a Robot, and it's a huge step for me. I was overwhelmed with happiness.

Thank you, Paul, for this amazing product, thanks to every single redditor in this sub for the knowledge and joy I got in the past 4 years, and thanks to Cafune for the gift of the Mikko coffee beans (I won't open it until I'm able to make good shots).

So far in two days I've brewed 5 or 6 cappuccinos and espressos for me and my wife, and it'll be a long journey of learning and joy.

Thank you for reading this far, hope you enjoy the 18 photos as much as I enjoyed taking them :)

TL;DR: Discovered specialty coffee in 2017, dreamed of the Robot since 2020, finally got it and I'm over the moon.

The problem? You're trying to reason with it. But your lizard brain doesn't give a shit about your responsibilities. It's an animal. And an animal has to be trained.

This animal only understands simple commands. Buttons you can push. Light, Heat, Movement. That's it.

**Rule #1: Get the beast outside.**

Your alarm goes off, your feet hit the floor, and you go OUTSIDE. Immediately. No coffee, no phone. Just you and the daylight for 15 minutes.

Daylight, even when it's overcast, hits the ON switch in your brain. This starts a countdown. In 16 hours, your body will want to sleep on its own. No fight.

**Rule #2: Heat up its kennel.**

Your body sleeps best when it's cool. In the morning, reverse the process. Set a heater to turn on or the AC to turn off before your alarm rings. When your bed covers become an oven, the beast will want to escape. It's automatic.

At first, it's going to suck. The beast will resist, that's normal. But it's still better than living like a zombie fueled by coffee all day.

**TL;DR:** Stop negotiating with your brain. Train it. Wake up at the same time every day. Get 15 mins of daylight. Heat your room to make getting out easier.",14,1755894065.0,DecidingToBeBetter,1,0.9,False

2. **Consider location vs. transport costs.** Some cheaper places might be further from attractions, so factor in Uber/Lyft costs or look into LA's improving public transit options.

3. **Take advantage of kitchenettes.** Even preparing just breakfast or lunch in your accommodation can save you $20-30 per day!

4. **Visit free attractions.** The Griffith Observatory, Venice Beach, and The Broad museum (with reservation) cost nothing to enjoy!

5. **Travel during shoulder season.** February (post-Oscars) and October offer great weather without peak prices.

I bought my lelit Bianca 2 years ago! wow time flies :)

I didn't change my beans or the grind size so my coffee beans/ground is consistent.

I'm not sure what it is but it's not getting to 9 bars of pressure like it always used to. I try to pull the shot without the portafilter to get the water go, and it doesn't go through. Instead of getting the shot to take 30 seconds, it takes almost a minute and a half and slowly works up to 3-5 bars of pressure. Additionally, it makes more noise than usual.

Does anyone know what could be the issue?

Do I feel better than I did with caffeine? No. Do I feel AS good as I did with caffeine? Also, no. But today is slightly better than yesterday, which was the first day I didn't want to die.

I'm realizing my nutrition most likely affected how awful I felt. In addition to the headaches, brain fog, body aches, bad dreams/poor sleep, and inability to stay awake during the day, I spent 5 days eating nothing but salt and sugar (NOT my normal diet at all) due to intense cravings and inability to function. I mistakenly thought drinking enough water would help, but once I said ""enough"" on day 5 and forced myself out the door for a walk/jog, forced some fruits and veggies and whole grains down my throat, and kept up with the water, I started to feel less horrid.

I'm still craving coffee and I'm still having trouble getting out of bed in the morning, but I feel like I might survive this. I'm still having my 48mg of caffeine in my gross mushroom coffee, but once the bag is gone, I will switch to fully decaf (actual) coffee. I still am very doubtful that this quitting thing will actually do anything to improve my health or how I feel, but I'm keeping on because I'm getting old and have to try something ;-)

For anyone struggling with withdrawal symptoms, I highly suggest having someone support you in eating well, I really think that made it so much worse for me!",3,1755893581.0,decaf,1,0.8,False

Over the years I’ve helped my friends with stuff like:

* Making resumes actually stand out & pass ATS

* Prepping for interviews (mock Q&As/rounds, cases, behavioral stuff)

* General career advice for consulting/strategy/finance roles

I was wondering if anyone here might be looking for this kind of help, whether it’s career guidance, mock interviews, or just someone to go over your CV. Happy to do it casually over coffee, online, or whatever works. DM me if you are interested.",1,1755893579.0,DubaiCentral,0,1.0,False
