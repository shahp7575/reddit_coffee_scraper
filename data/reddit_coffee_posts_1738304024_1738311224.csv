This might seem controversial but for me vaping was worse than when I smoked cigarettes, I know vaping doesn‚Äôt contain some of the harmful chemicals you get from cigarettes but the fact that a vape never goes out means you can vape all day and all you need to do is change a pod and just carry on vaping.

When I quit I didn‚Äôt use any NRT‚Äôs, I don‚Äôt miss the JUUL and quitting is one of the best things I‚Äôve done in a long time, I have so much more energy now, I‚Äôm not rushing to finish a meal just so I can have a vape after, I don‚Äôt stand outside coffee shops in the cold and rain just so I can vape, it‚Äôs been a very freeing experience for me.

For those going through a tough time quitting I know my post might seem like I‚Äôm bragging but I just wanted to let you know that however bad you‚Äôre feeling it will pass and you can and will enjoy life without vaping.",1,1738311086.0,QuittingJUUL,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone thank you for stopping and reading this.

I am typing this to seek advice specifically from females and people who are familiar with Turkish dating culture and the whole courting system. I promise I will keep it short and simple. 

I (29M) recently started living in Turkey, and it's been a pleasure overall so far. Like any other heterosexual bachelor, I meet women and go out for coffee or lunch mostly to have simple conversations and see where it goes. However, I have a very particular preference. I am more like a brain and personality kind'a guy. I get attracted to how she looks and then I look for how smart and aware she is, her ideologies her overall psychology. I always ask deep questions to know her, and so far, have been disappointed. 

During all this, about three months ago I met a girl at work. She is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in my life. There is just no comparison. We started interacting and became good friends. I never asked her out because I needed to stay professional and I didn't want anything or anyone tarnishing our reputation. It's been a month or so that she has started to grow on me. We have started to talk more often, even when we are at home. She pays attention to my habits, and what I say or do. She is interested in knowing more about me. All this is new to me. I must add, that her intellect is just PERFECT, not a single flaw, we resonate together in a symphony, synchronized and magical. It's surreal. I go to bed at 10 PM no matter what, but now it's difficult unless we talk to each other or at least I am sure she is home safe. She knew my routine so she started to text me whenever she reaches home so that I can sleep peacefully. I never asked for it she just started doing it.  

I wanted to ask her out, but instead, I invited her home so that I could introduce her to my two sisters (who live in the same city) and have dinner with us. I have never done this before, this was just out of nowhere. Surprisingly, she said yes and was very happy about it. She even bought gifts for my sisters, which she didn't have to do, but I thought it was very sweet. She even went on to buy a very thoughtful gift for me as well - and when I say thoughtful, that means she outdid herself. My family knows I am a very difficult man to impress, so they don't even bother. And this girl who had just known me for 3 months brought my inner child out. As I said before, she is amazing. 

Now, I am confused. Is this normal in Turkey? or does she actually like me? or does she just want to be around me because I am a foreigner and can speak fluent English? I am planning on asking her myself, but I am afraid. I feel like she is perfect for me, like a gem in the desert. If this is just her being friendly, I want to know, so that I can control my emotions and never bring up the subject and we can stay friends. But if I ask her and she says it's just her being friendly, my whole reality would be distorted. I am a very independent and practical guy I don't need someone to be friendly with me and care for me unless I have a very deep emotional connection with them. I don't need friends, especially the ones who I would invite home to meet my sisters. It's very personal for me. If I am doing this it's not a joke. When I am in a relationship, I am fully committed, I don't pursue flings, crushes or infatuations. I love this girl, and I am fully ready to commit but I am not sure about her.       


Where I am from, a woman does all this when she is in love. I don't know anything about Turkey and Turkish people.    ",1,1738310662.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

A month ago I was fired from my job. I was really upset about the whole situation. I was working as a SW Engineer in a corporation. My job was average-difficult, lots of meetings, lots of distractions. I was generally tired of the job. Sleep problems, lots of coffee, high body weight, lots of sweets, zero workouts and the like. Generally a bad way of life. My life was gloomy, etc.

  
Now I see that it was good, I have a lot of time and my well-being is at a higher level. I rested. I plan to go back to CrossFit classes. Unfortunately I have to go back to work, I have several offers and I have to decide on one of them. My question is how to take care of my well-being, work-life balance and the like, to avoid burnout stagnation in a new job. It's hard to do anything else after work. Can you tell me how you take care of yourself during the week? What do you do on the weekend? What does your day look like, what else do you do after work and the like, what tips do you have for me so that I don't go back to stagnation in a new job, etc.

  
All comments are welcome, if you have any recommendations in the form of books, articles, videos on YT, I will accept everything.

1ie9vhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1ie9vhj/am_i_too_insensitiveinconsiderate_to_women/,Am I too insensitive/inconsiderate to women,"Hi all, the post might be a bit incendiary for the opposite sex. Please be assured I mean no disrespect to anyone, but I really need another opinion. I'm a 25 (M) working in a lab (doing my PhD). I've never been in an inner friend circle with women, never had a girlfriend for a variety of reasons: introverted, only boys school till 10th, ridiculed by the family for looks at a young age, so have an inferiority complex, lower-middle-class, etc.), trying to work on it.

My problem is with connecting with/understanding women. So I have a female friend (call her A), who I feel gets angry for the smallest reason. Yesterday, A had a bad day, as her experiment didn't work; she cried and needed someone to console her and rant to (usually me and a mutual male friend - Y). I was in a meeting with my PA (PhD advisor) and other professors. So couldn't didn't see her texts for an hour. She got really angry as to why my phone was on silent and told me never to talk to her. I tried to explain myself but got into an argument about putting my phone on vibrate, at least.

Another incident was when she got angry because I took the help of Y instead of her for a small experiment (plasmid isolation - for those who know). I tried to talk to her, both in person and over text. She didn't speak to me the entire day. Then, she told me my efforts to please her were insignificant. I had a deadline that day to submit a report (so I didn't give her as much attention as I usually would have).

Another incident was when she got angry about me not wanting to have tea (because she and I had just coffee an hour ago while attending a seminar), but I said I'd go with her if she wanted to have it. She was angry because I didn't, by my own volition, want to have tea with her (context: me, she and Y go for tea every day). There have been many such incidents like this. Every time she does this, it's usually me who has to step down and say sorry. Me and her are no longer friends after yesterday.

Another previous female friend (we went to a conference together) didn't talk to me for a period of 12 days abroad. It was my first trip abroad (not for her), so I was excited to see a foreign country and we had made many plans together. The reason she got angry, which she said after coming back to India, was that I made a comment/joke about her taking time to get ready (something I've said jokingly 1 or 2 times before) and another comment/joke about she was having trouble to walk to the conference (it was 2 km hike uphill). Me and her were friends for 8 months at the time. She would tease me as well, regarding my choice of haircut, monochrome clothes, boys not taking time to get ready, etc. So I really didn't think the joke I made would make her upset.

But anyway, I tried talking to her many times during the conference; she acted like nothing was wrong, and I was miserable during the entire conference (even my PA asked me what happened). She also made another comment in front of others (another lab) that I was of no use and to take me with them. I didn't say anything as I wanted to diffuse the situation. After coming back, she said that my efforts to please her were not enough, and I should've said sorry even without knowing my wrong, and it was my male ego not to say sorry. I pointed out, isn't it a female ego that you want me to apologize without knowing my wrong, Despite my efforts to talk and sort out, she didn't reciprocate, which could have been done easily. She said ""Yeah females have an ego and that's fine, I was on my periods, so you should've been considerate, nicer to me and made more efforts to please me"". Me and her are no longer friends.

I've had a similar incident of bursting out with one other female colleague, not a friend.

I've never had such problems with my male friends, none of the above incidents would have even made a blip in their radar, even if there are differences we just let it go, sort it out, without much friction. We usually don't even say sorry. I really mean no disrespect to all women, neither to the women I've talked about here. But I really need another opinion, is this normal? Do I need to change things about myself and be more sensitive around women?

**TLDR, my female friends get hurt by me, so don't know if I'm insensitive or they are overly sensitive. Am I wrong for not being sensitive to women? Sorry for the long read, but wanted to give the entire context, being fair to both parties**.",0,1738310042.0,AskIndianWomen,9,0.5,False

1ie9tkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ie9tkl/exploring_coffee_futures/,Exploring Coffee Futures,"Hi everyone,

As the title suggests, this post is about coffee futures. I‚Äôm new to futures trading, particularly in commodities, and I‚Äôd love to hear insights from experienced traders.

I‚Äôll structure this post by first asking my questions and then providing some background on myself and why I believe coffee is an interesting investment for the future.

Questions:
1.	News & Market Information

‚Ä¢	What are the best news sources for agricultural commodities?

‚Ä¢	Specifically for coffee, I follow Perfect Daily Grind, Sprudge, and Daily Coffee News, but is there a consolidated news ticker or platform focused on coffee futures (C contracts)?

2.	Market Behavior

‚Ä¢	My understanding of ICE futures trading is that it‚Äôs less volatile than the stock market since retail (emotional) traders are largely absent.

‚Ä¢	How does the coffee futures market typically behave, and what are the key factors that influence price movements?

3.	Trading Strategies

‚Ä¢	Are there specific trading strategies tailored for commodities, or is it purely driven by supply and demand?

‚Ä¢	Are there particular indicators or patterns that traders use when analyzing coffee futures?

4.	Advice for Beginners

‚Ä¢	I understand futures contracts and the associated risks, but I‚Äôm looking for commodity-specific advice.

‚Ä¢	Any key lessons, common mistakes to avoid, or tips from experienced traders would be greatly appreciated.

5.	Exit Strategies

‚Ä¢	My goal is to trade coffee futures and sell before the contract reaches the notice period.

‚Ä¢	What are the best exit strategies to optimize profits while minimizing risk exposure?

Who Am I?

I‚Äôve been a Food & Beverage professional for 19 years, starting as a waiter and working my way up to Head of Catering for one of the largest catering companies in the world. I studied Hotel Management, which included beverage training in tea and coffee, and spent a significant part of my career in luxury hospitality (Hilton, etc.) as an F&B Director. Coffee, as a consumable, is a topic I feel confident in.

On the trading side, I have a solid investment background in the stock market and income-generating real estate, with profits reinvested in stocks. I now want to elevate my trading experience into futures and options. Options trading still feels overwhelming, but futures seem more natural to me.

In my company, we import goods globally and secure fixed-price contracts for about a year through tenders, which in a way resembles futures trading‚Äîexcept that we actually take delivery of the product.

Why Coffee?

‚Ä¢	Coffee is the most consumed beverage worldwide, and with global population growth, demand is unlikely to decline in the next decade.

‚Ä¢	Climate change is leading to more extreme weather conditions, which disrupt coffee harvests and impact supply.

‚Ä¢	Historically, coffee started as a luxury product, became widely accessible through industrialization, and now risks becoming scarce again due to production challenges.

Supply & Market Dynamics

There are only four main types of coffee beans:
‚Ä¢	Arabica (dominates the global market, linked to ICE ‚ÄúC‚Äù price)

‚Ä¢	Robusta (resilient, growing in demand)

‚Ä¢	Excelsa

‚Ä¢	Liberica

Key points to consider:

‚Ä¢	Arabica is highly sensitive to climate change and pests, making its supply more volatile.

‚Ä¢	Robusta is more resilient and can grow at lower altitudes, making it a more stable option for farmers.

‚Ä¢	Brazil, one of the world‚Äôs largest coffee producers, is already shifting toward higher Robusta cultivation due to its consistent yields and resistance to climate change.

‚Ä¢	Despite Robusta‚Äôs growth, Arabica is still considered superior in quality, keeping its demand strong.

The Bigger Picture

Some argue that coffee prices will surge over the next decade due to a combination of:

1.	Reduced Arabica yields from climate change (lower supply).

2.	Growing global population (higher demand).

3.	Coffee‚Äôs role as a staple commodity, meaning price increases could make it unaffordable for many, turning it back into a luxury product.

1ie9lh6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ie9lh6,Harold's Hotel,"For my first ""me time"" this 2025, I chose to stay somewhere familiar.

The Place: Harold's Hotel formerly known Harold's Evotel. Booked their Superior King Non-Smoking room via Agoda for ‚Ç±3041.40 inclusive of taxes. This booking did not include breakfast but is available at ‚Ç±600+ per head.

I have stayed here a couple of times in the past but this is the first time I was able to claim the complimentary drinks upon check-in. The drinks at the time was a choice between iced-tea or cucumber. Cucumber was powedered juice instead of fresh cucumber so iced-tea won (forgot to take pic when glass was full ü§≠). 

Drinks are claimed at the roof deck which houses Highlights Lounge. Pictures were taken around 11:30pm which possibly is the reason there were only a few people. You can dine, drink, smoke and experience some sights and the city lights.

One of the things that I noticed on my way up to my room is that the elevator no longer needed a keycard to access any floors. As always the room is clean and neat, has all what you would expect like coffee, free bottles of water, the fridge, big tv, hangers in the closet and a big bed with 4 pillows. What I liked about staying here is the big mirror in front of the extended desk. My previous stays involved working and I like looking at myself in the mirror üòÖü§≠ specially when I'm talking (have a mirror in my desk at the office). Speaking of work where I need internet connection, theirs is strong enough to handle my workload but you have to log back in to their network after a couple of hours.

Other things I look for when booking a room is a bathtub. Scratch that, it's the first consideration. üòä Like I said I've stayed here plenty and has booked other sized rooms but never have I seen a bathtub as big and deep as that of the tub at Cebu R Hotel Mabolo (can't seem to get enough üôÑ) Anyway, the tub served it's purpose for me as usual but for some reason the water isn't hot enough. I mean I've had other misses during my previous stays like where the tub won't fill with water but nothing that their maintenance guy can't fix. I didn't call maintenance on this one because they might think I'm trying to boil myself in the tub by complaining that the water ain't hot enough üòÇ.

Overall, it was a pleasant stay. Everyone was cordial from check-in, ordering drinks to check out.",4,1738308769.0,CebuHotelReviews,1,1.0,False

So does a small home use RO system that does precise or semi precise mineral addition exist? Most of what I‚Äôve seen have an additional stage where the water is passed through what they call calcite medium and basically just adds a bunch of minerals, mostly calcium carbonate, but with no particular precision and can vary wildly. Or they‚Äôre full fledged commercial water purification systems.

Any ideas?

1ie9hxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Commodities/comments/1ie9hxq/exploring_coffee_futures_questions_insights_from/,Exploring Coffee Futures ‚Äì Questions & Insights from a New Trader,"Hi everyone,

As the title suggests, this post is about coffee futures. I‚Äôm new to futures trading, particularly in commodities, and I‚Äôd love to hear insights from experienced traders.

I‚Äôll structure this post by first asking my questions and then providing some background on myself and why I believe coffee is an interesting investment for the future.

Questions:
1.	News & Market Information

‚Ä¢	What are the best news sources for agricultural commodities?

‚Ä¢	Specifically for coffee, I follow Perfect Daily Grind, Sprudge, and Daily Coffee News, but is there a consolidated news ticker or platform focused on coffee futures (C contracts)?

2.	Market Behavior

‚Ä¢	My understanding of ICE futures trading is that it‚Äôs less volatile than the stock market since retail (emotional) traders are largely absent.

‚Ä¢	How does the coffee futures market typically behave, and what are the key factors that influence price movements?

3.	Trading Strategies

‚Ä¢	Are there specific trading strategies tailored for commodities, or is it purely driven by supply and demand?

‚Ä¢	Are there particular indicators or patterns that traders use when analyzing coffee futures?

4.	Advice for Beginners

‚Ä¢	I understand futures contracts and the associated risks, but I‚Äôm looking for commodity-specific advice.

‚Ä¢	Any key lessons, common mistakes to avoid, or tips from experienced traders would be greatly appreciated.

5.	Exit Strategies

‚Ä¢	My goal is to trade coffee futures and sell before the contract reaches the notice period.

‚Ä¢	What are the best exit strategies to optimize profits while minimizing risk exposure?

Who Am I?

I‚Äôve been a Food & Beverage professional for 19 years, starting as a waiter and working my way up to Head of Catering for one of the largest catering companies in the world. I studied Hotel Management, which included beverage training in tea and coffee, and spent a significant part of my career in luxury hospitality (Hilton, etc.) as an F&B Director. Coffee, as a consumable, is a topic I feel confident in.

On the trading side, I have a solid investment background in the stock market and income-generating real estate, with profits reinvested in stocks. I now want to elevate my trading experience into futures and options. Options trading still feels overwhelming, but futures seem more natural to me.

In my company, we import goods globally and secure fixed-price contracts for about a year through tenders, which in a way resembles futures trading‚Äîexcept that we actually take delivery of the product.

Why Coffee?

‚Ä¢	Coffee is the most consumed beverage worldwide, and with global population growth, demand is unlikely to decline in the next decade.

‚Ä¢	Climate change is leading to more extreme weather conditions, which disrupt coffee harvests and impact supply.

‚Ä¢	Historically, coffee started as a luxury product, became widely accessible through industrialization, and now risks becoming scarce again due to production challenges.

Supply & Market Dynamics

There are only four main types of coffee beans:
‚Ä¢	Arabica (dominates the global market, linked to ICE ‚ÄúC‚Äù price)

‚Ä¢	Robusta (resilient, growing in demand)

‚Ä¢	Excelsa

‚Ä¢	Liberica

Key points to consider:

‚Ä¢	Arabica is highly sensitive to climate change and pests, making its supply more volatile.

‚Ä¢	Robusta is more resilient and can grow at lower altitudes, making it a more stable option for farmers.

‚Ä¢	Brazil, one of the world‚Äôs largest coffee producers, is already shifting toward higher Robusta cultivation due to its consistent yields and resistance to climate change.

‚Ä¢	Despite Robusta‚Äôs growth, Arabica is still considered superior in quality, keeping its demand strong.

The Bigger Picture

Some argue that coffee prices will surge over the next decade due to a combination of:

1.	Reduced Arabica yields from climate change (lower supply).

2.	Growing global population (higher demand).

3.	Coffee‚Äôs role as a staple commodity, meaning price increases could make it unaffordable for many, turning it back into a luxury product.

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on the future of coffee trading, best strategies, and market trends. Looking forward to learning from the community!",2,1738308330.0,Commodities,0,1.0,False

DAD'S RULES: 

1: dad doesn't like it when you touch the stereo in the car, so if he catches you touching it, he'll slap your hand, and tell you not to touch it. 

2: sometimes, dad will ask you pop the hood of the car, so he can check some of the fluids. if you refuse to pop the hood, dad will pop the hood himself, and start slamming your head in it. 

3: dad hates it when you mess with the AC in the car, so if you do, he will hit your hand with a hammer. 

MOM'S RULES: 

1: mom likes coffee. if she doesn't get her coffee, she will be angry. 

2: mom likes to read the Bible. if you touch her Bible, she will bash your head in with it. 

3: mom likes sleep. if you don't let her sleep, she will smother you with her pillow. 

BIG BROTHER'S RULES:

1: if big brother sees you touching his headphones, he will get extremely angry, and he will snap your neck.

I'd say Ive tried enough running brands to know what works for me and what doesn't. However, tights is the 1 piece of clothing that I haven't tried as much. I have worn a few different ones, but the big thing i've found is they ride down. and for that reason, i haven't really worn it during a run.



positives - in order of impression

‚Ä¢ incredibly breathable. my back side is usually soaked after a run; i wore a 5"" short over the tights and when i took it off, it was barely wet. Same short with different underwear, the boxer would always be soaked. this is truly impressive.

‚Ä¢ doesn't ride down. the tights are real tight. once you put it on, it really stays in place.

‚Ä¢ good temperature regulation. i've worn this in 2C to 8C and while at 8C it was slightly warm, it wasn't uncomfortable. The website says it is meant for below 0C, while i haven't tried running in that temperature, i'd say anything below 6C is good.



negatives - in order

‚Ä¢ it is way too expensive. i love technical fabrics but 400CAD is too much. I would not buy at full price. (I got this on a crazy sale for just over 100CAD at a department store)

‚Ä¢ it is TIGHT. the material isn't as stretchy as other tights i've tried, so it is uncomfortable to wear. You'll almost feel like it is too small. I'd say during a run it isn't noticeable, however I do not want to wear this when not running. the minute i get home, i take it off right away.

‚Ä¢ doesn't have a liner inside. i know many brands include a liner of some sort at the front, this one does not. And for this reason, i'd always wear a short over it.",1,1738308282.0,satisfyrunning,0,1.0,False

1ie9dv2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ie9dv2,Blessed with Beamer,"A few months ago, late July, I started hearing the familiar, faint cries of a kitten. Sure enough, a baby boy - weened waaay too early - was on my porch munching away at the adult dry cat food I leave out. Poor thing was struggling with it too. He was just too young. 

Thankfully, a friend gave me some leftover kitten food that night and I ordered more to be delivered the next day. So, a ritual was born where I'd prepare the kitten food and enjoy my morning coffee on the porch to make sure my greedy outdoor adult cats didn't rob the little guy. 

At first, he was very skittish. I think it was a week before I could pet him. I was home on leave after foot surgery. I'd wrestle myself onto the porch in my wheelchair, then sit on the steps with my coffee. He would sit on the sidewalk and just stare at me. He would observe with eyes wide open as I petted and held my other cats. That's when he finally realized this human, with his wheels and leg wrapped in a tantalizing scratching post, must be cat council approved. üòÇ

Unfortunately, Buddy crossed the rainbow bridge a few weeks ago. Beamer went through a mourning phase, where he laid by Buddy's carrier, still containing Buddy's blanket he liked to lay on.

Whether they're dealing with physical injuries, emotional distress, or the aftermath of an insurance claim, your support can make a big difference. But beyond offering kind words, you may wonder, ‚ÄúWhat can I give them?‚Äù

While the situation may vary depending on the accident's severity, a few thoughtful gestures can ease their stress and show them you care. At the same time, it‚Äôs important to understand the role of a car accident attorney, especially in places like Omaha, where legal matters related to accidents can be complex.

In this article, we'll explore how you can provide comfort and support and why seeking legal help can be just as vital in the aftermath of an accident.

# Practical Support: Thoughtful Ways to Help

When someone is recovering from a car accident, the most meaningful gifts are often those that provide comfort, convenience, or a little extra help during a stressful time. Here are a few ways to offer support:

**Home-cooked meals or food delivery**One of the best ways to show you care is by helping with meals. If the person is in pain or recovering from an injury, the last thing they‚Äôll want to do is cook. Offering to prepare a few meals or arranging for food delivery can take a load off their shoulders.

**Transportation help**After a car accident, the person might not have access to their vehicle or be unable to drive due to injury. Offering rides to and from appointments, the grocery store, or even just to get out of the house can be a big help.

**Gift cards**A gift card can be a great option if you're unsure what the person needs. A card for a grocery store, pharmacy, or gas station can be especially practical, allowing them to get what they need during their recovery process.

**Comfort items**Soft blankets, pillows, or heating pads can make a difference if someone is dealing with aches and pains. Something as simple as a cozy blanket can provide comfort during recovery, especially when combined with a thoughtful note or card.

**Personal care items**Depending on the severity of the injuries, the person may need help with personal care tasks, such as bathing or grooming. Offering to pick up personal care items like lotions, pain relievers, or even a new toothbrush can be helpful.

**Entertainment and distractions**Being stuck at home recovering from an accident can feel isolating. Providing books, puzzles, or even streaming services subscriptions can help pass the time and keep the person‚Äôs mind off the pain.

**Offer emotional support**Sometimes, the best gift you can give is simply being there. Whether it‚Äôs a listening ear, a phone call, or a visit, offering emotional support can help someone feel less alone. Kind gestures like offering to sit with them during appointments or just catching up over coffee can make a big impact.

# The Role of a Car Accident Attorney in Omaha

While offering practical help is important, there‚Äôs another way you can support someone recovering from a car accident: encouraging them to seek legal assistance. An experienced car accident attorney in Omaha can be invaluable if the accident involves serious injuries or disputes over fault.

Here‚Äôs why having a car accident attorney can be a smart move:

**Navigating complex insurance claims**After a car accident, dealing with insurance companies can be one of the most frustrating parts of the process. An attorney can help ensure that the person gets the compensation they‚Äôre entitled to, especially when insurance companies may try to minimize payouts or deny claims. This is particularly important in Omaha, where traffic laws and insurance policies vary. A knowledgeable attorney will know the ins and outs of local laws and how to negotiate with insurance adjusters.

**Assessing the true value of the claim**In some cases, an accident may involve more than immediate medical bills. Long-term medical care, lost wages, and other expenses could need to be considered. An attorney can help assess the claim's full value and ensure all potential damages are accounted for.

**Protecting legal rights**Even in minor accidents, it‚Äôs easy to overlook how an injury might affect someone long-term. An attorney can protect the person's legal rights by ensuring that any settlements or legal actions are in their best interest. If the other party is at fault, or if there‚Äôs a dispute about fault, an attorney can advocate for the person and work to hold the responsible party accountable.

**Handling paperwork and deadlines**Car accident cases often involve lots of paperwork, including medical records, insurance forms, and legal documents. Missing a deadline or making an error in this paperwork could delay the process or even result in a denial of compensation. A car accident attorney can handle the paperwork and ensure everything is filed promptly and accurately.

**Providing emotional relief**While an attorney isn‚Äôt a counselor, knowing that someone is handling the legal aspects of the case can provide significant emotional relief. This lets the person focus on healing rather than paperwork or negotiations. In many ways, hiring an attorney helps take some of the burden off their shoulders, which is a crucial aspect of the recovery process.

# Other Ways to Help Someone After an Accident

In addition to the practical and legal support, there are other ways you can be there for someone in the aftermath of a car accident. Consider these thoughtful gestures:

**Check-in regularly**Even if you can‚Äôt be there in person, sending a text or a quick call to check in can go a long way. Sometimes, knowing someone cares is enough to lift someone's spirits during recovery.

**Offer to help with household chores.s**Whether picking up groceries, doing the laundry, or helping with other household tasks, offering assistance with daily chores can relieve stress and allow the person to focus on healing.

**Set up a support network.k**Consider organizing a support network if the person‚Äôs family and friends are far away. This could involve coordinating people to visit, offer rides, or take over errands. Having a group of people available can provide a sense of community and reduce feelings of isolation.

**Respect their needs and boundari.es**While it‚Äôs great to offer help, respecting thee person‚Äôs needs and boundaries is important. Is important. They may want space to rest or may not feel up for company right away. Be patient and let them guide you on how and when they wish to receive support.

# Conclusion

Being involved in a car accident is a challenging experience, and the recovery process can be long and stressful. While practical gifts and emotional support can provide comfort, it‚Äôs just as important to consider the legal aspects of the situation. [For someone recovering in Omaha, having a skilled car accident attorney can make a significant difference in ensuring they get the compensation and legal representation they deserve.](https://www.abboudlawfirm.com/car-accidents/)

By offering both practical help and encouraging them to seek legal assistance, you can play a meaningful role in their recovery, whether they need rides, meals, or advice about their legal rights. Small gestures of kindness and professional support can make a world of difference, especially during a time when every bit of help counts.",2,1738306938.0,u_Many_Yard9996,0,1.0,False

College life is fast-paced and exciting, but it also presents unique challenges when it comes to living sustainably. As a student, making eco-friendly choices may seem difficult due to budget constraints and limited living space, but it‚Äôs possible to adopt¬†[**sustainable habits**](https://www.ecohabituals.com/2025/01/10-sustainable-living-documentaries-you.html)¬†that will not only benefit the environment but also your personal well-being.

Here are¬†**simple and practical tips**¬†for¬†**eco-conscious living**¬†in college, even if you're living in a dorm or a small apartment.

# 1. Start with Your Daily Routine

# ‚úÖ¬†Use Reusable Water Bottles

Instead of buying bottled water every day, invest in a¬†**reusable water bottle**. This small change can significantly reduce the amount of plastic waste you generate and save you money.

üîπ¬†**Amazon Recommendation:**¬†[Stainless Steel Insulated Water Bottle](https://amzn.to/40Fjmi7)¬†‚Äì Keep your drinks cold or hot for hours while reducing plastic waste.

# ‚úÖ¬†Switch to Reusable Coffee Cups

If you‚Äôre a coffee lover, consider¬†**reusable coffee cups**¬†instead of single-use paper cups. Most coffee shops offer discounts when you bring your own cup.

üîπ¬†**Amazon Recommendation:**¬†[Collapsible Coffee Cup¬†](https://amzn.to/4hjd5Qk)‚Äì A convenient, eco-friendly solution for your daily caffeine fix.

# 2. Minimize Waste

# ‚úÖ¬†Recycle and Compost

Most colleges have¬†**recycling programs**, so be sure to separate recyclables from general waste. If you have access to a compost bin, try to compost food scraps. You‚Äôd be surprised how much waste can be reduced this way.

üîπ¬†**Amazon Recommendation:**¬†[Countertop Compost Bin¬†](https://amzn.to/3WFxczW)‚Äì Easy and odor-free composting at home.

# ‚úÖ¬†Reduce Paper Use

Switch to¬†**digital notes**¬†instead of printing or writing everything down. Use apps like Google Docs, OneNote, or Evernote for keeping your notes organized and reducing paper waste.

# 3. Energy Conservation

# ‚úÖ¬†Unplug Electronics When Not in Use

College dorms often have many electronics plugged in all the time. Unplugging chargers, lamps, and appliances when they‚Äôre not in use helps¬†**save energy**¬†and¬†**reduce your carbon footprint**.

# ‚úÖ¬†Use Energy-Efficient Lighting

Swap out old bulbs with¬†**energy-efficient LED lights**¬†that use less energy and last longer, cutting your electricity bill.

üîπ¬†**Amazon Recommendation:**¬†[Energy-Efficient LED Light Bulbs](https://amzn.to/4jAcxar)¬†‚Äì A cost-effective and long-lasting lighting solution.

# 4. Sustainable Food Choices

# ‚úÖ¬†Plan Your Meals

Meal prepping is a great way to¬†**reduce food waste**¬†and save time. Plan meals based on seasonal ingredients and buy in bulk to minimize packaging waste.

üîπ¬†**Amazon Recommendation:**¬†[Glass Meal Prep Containers](https://amzn.to/40CBcSX)¬†‚Äì Perfect for storing and organizing your homemade meals.

# ‚úÖ¬†Shop Locally

When possible, purchase¬†**fresh produce**¬†from local farmers' markets or campus-organized events. Locally sourced food tends to have a smaller carbon footprint compared to grocery store products that are shipped long distances.

# 5. Eco-Friendly School Supplies

# ‚úÖ¬†Choose Sustainable Stationery

Opt for recycled paper, biodegradable pens, and eco-friendly binders to reduce the environmental impact of your school supplies.

üîπ¬†**Amazon Recommendation:**¬†[Recycled Paper Notebook](https://amzn.to/42Bew8h)¬†‚Äì Sustainable and practical for all your note-taking needs.

# ‚úÖ¬†Buy Secondhand Textbooks

Instead of purchasing brand-new textbooks, look for secondhand or digital versions. You can find used textbooks online, through campus bookstores, or via digital platforms.

# 6. Green Transportation

# ‚úÖ¬†Bike or Walk

If your college campus is walkable, walking or biking is a great way to reduce your carbon emissions while staying active.

üîπ¬†**Amazon Recommendation:**¬†Eco-Friendly Bike ‚Äì Get around campus with ease and reduce your carbon footprint.

# ‚úÖ¬†Use Public Transportation

If biking or walking isn't an option, check out public transportation routes or consider¬†**ridesharing**¬†with friends to cut down on personal car use.

# 7. Sustainable Laundry Habits

# ‚úÖ¬†Wash in Cold Water

When doing laundry, wash clothes in¬†**cold water**¬†to save energy and reduce your environmental impact. Cold washes are just as effective as warm washes for most laundry loads.

# ‚úÖ¬†Air Dry Your Clothes

Whenever possible, try to air-dry clothes instead of using a dryer. This reduces energy consumption and extends the life of your clothing.

# Conclusion

Living sustainably as a student can be challenging, but with a few simple and practical changes, you can make a big impact. From reducing waste and conserving energy to making more sustainable food choices, there are countless ways to incorporate eco-friendly habits into your college life.¬†

Small changes add up, and soon you‚Äôll see the difference you‚Äôre making for the planet‚Äîand your wallet.

My friend uses she/they pronouns so I‚Äôll probably switch in and out, sorry for the confusion. Also, sorry in advance for the length but thank you so much for reading! 

Soon after I first moved to the city I‚Äôm in now six years ago, we met at a gay bar where we very quickly clicked over shared interests like video games, drag, and going dancing. While we spent a lot of weekends at drag shows and parties together the first year we met, we cemented our friendship over 2020 when we spent days on end online and gaming together. Post pandemic when the world resumed some normalcy, she was one of my main friends that would go out on the weekends with me. We would talk every day and she truly became chosen family for me over the past few years. She made me feel seen and understood in a way that I was hoping to find in the friends I made in a city where I knew no one. 

My friend struggles heavily with her mental health and substance abuse issues, it‚Äôs gotten increasingly worse over the course of our friendship. Their abuse of drugs and alcohol in particular has become a heavy burden for me to help them carry. For personal context, I grew up in a household where one my parents heavily abused the exact same substances as my friend does now and it caused a lot of trauma in my childhood and young adulthood. My friend knows about this trauma of mine and historically they‚Äôve had a respectful attitude and convey awareness of what I‚Äôve been through and the fact that it‚Äôs left me with some sensitivities. Unfortunately, it does not stop them from brining drugs around me, whether it‚Äôs to have more fun on a night out or to help them treat their mental health issues in their own way. 

Throughout the past year, it‚Äôs become harder for us to socialize together as our shared interests have gotten to be fewer and our personalities have begun to clash more. Over the most recent years, we would have almost weekly conversations about her mental and physical health where she would seemingly be asking for help and advice but never applied any of it. Unfortunately, this has resulted in a growing resentment within me as I feel like I‚Äôm dealing with someone who refuses to make any efforts to genuinely help themselves. 

Over this past summer we passively started to talk less, but we ended up going on a group trip out of town for a concert with some mutual friends. As this was a trip to a city I‚Äôve previously lived in, I took on the role of doing almost all of the work to arrange the trip, I put in a lot of effort to plan something nice for my friends. Before we even left she was very non-communicative with our group to the point where other friends expressed concern about bringing her. We pressed on and when I picked her up to head out, she got in the car looking disheveled and reeking of booze. She was the only person in our group that brought drugs and wanted to ‚Äúgo hard‚Äù to have a wild weekend out of town. 

On that trip she drank and used more than I had ever seen before, it truly frightened me and put me back into the same fight or flight mentality of my childhood. Unfortunately, this led to me being rather insensitive and rude towards her as this was not the first or second trip we‚Äôve taken where she‚Äôs abused to the point of becoming a liability and ultimately making the experience center around taking care of her. I was equal parts frustrated with her and disappointed in my inability to continue to give her empathy and support. 

A few days after we got home, I spent time writing a long thought out message apologizing for not being as kind towards her as I could have been and explaining how I‚Äôve been feeling very uncomfortable by her drug and alcohol abuse for quite some time. I reminded her of my experiences growing up, only to help convey where I‚Äôm at mentally when I‚Äôm encountering that version of her. I did also state that while I loved her very much and want nothing more than to see her thriving, I would need to figure out boundaries in our relationship and have some space for a bit. I made sure to state that I didn‚Äôt want our relationship to end, I do not want to abandon someone I care about. 

She very quickly responded saying she accepts my apology and wishes the weekend could have been better. She also stated that while she wishes her addiction wasn‚Äôt what it is, she can‚Äôt just change it. In my message I explicitly said that after dealing with an addict parent for 20 years, I know it‚Äôs something that can‚Äôt be changed overnight. Her saying that showed me she did not truly take in anything from what I felt was a very vulnerable and honest message. 

We then didn‚Äôt interact at all for a few weeks but she messaged me asking to meet up in person over coffee to have a more in-depth conversation. I was absolutely on board but unfortunately we‚Äôre adults with opposite schedules and making it work was proving to be difficult. She cancelled on me the first two times we had planned and then left a halloween get together after I text the host saying I was on the way; so naturally I stopped trying to schedule a meeting she requested. During that time she was telling mutual friends that I hate her and that she was becoming increasingly convinced that actually no one likes her. She also was hospitalized for issues caused by her drinking, it led to her being sober for about a month. 

Eventually at a mutual friend‚Äôs birthday party in early December, we were able to find time to slip away. We cleared the air and affirmed to each other that it‚Äôs ultimately all love between us and we had a great night celebrating our friend. We mildly resumed messaging each other like we used to but we did not see each other again til New Year‚Äôs eve. During that party we had a good small talk but she was making passive comments insinuating I was avoiding her when I would leave the room or be talking to others. A few of us went to head to a bar and I drove us down, we she got in the car she said, ‚Äúwow it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve been in here, not since we stopped being friends.‚Äù While I‚Äôm sure it was a joke, combined with the other comments I was feeling like she was intentionally guilting me for having to step away from our relationship. 

We shared two nights out with mutual friends earlier this month, both of which I did not plan to see her at and she‚Äôs become unbearable to be around. She‚Äôs back to heavily using and it‚Äôs making other friend‚Äôs uncomfortable now as well. After us not texting each other for weeks, last night she messaged me asking for affirmations about her mental health. I haven‚Äôt been able to respond yet as I feel like our relationship has devolved into me endlessly supporting her while never receiving any consideration in return.

Mutual friends still bring her around and I don‚Äôt want to be the cause of others excluding her as I‚Äôm worried about the effect that could have. She‚Äôs not in therapy or treatment of any kind yet will constantly talk about how things have to change and get better. I want nothing more than to see her on a better path but I‚Äôm not sure how much more of my own space and energy I can spare.

(I am 19M and she is 19F),"Hello guys, hope yall are doing well. I (19M) been seeing my now gf (19F), I think at least haha, for about 4 months. To keep things in perspective, we are both in college, and both a little mentally unstable right now. She has been diagnosed with depression in the past. And I was genuinely suicidal like only 2 months ago.  I am an international student, so I was back home for winter break which was a month. Due to my suicidal thoughts I really fucked up my previous semester, failing all of my 4 classes (I am in engineering so it isn't the easiest honestly). Also after break I left my university's dorm and now living off-campus. Which will be better for me on the long run. But for now I am living with 3 housemates and I don't have a room, I sleep on the ground in the living room. I don't even have a light in this room lol. Of course I didn't know my transitional phase will be this bad before I moved off campus. So when I started dating her I didn't know it will be this bad for me this semester. I also don't have a car but I have the money for it and am currently looking for one to buy.

Usually I wouldn't date when am this down bad. But as I stated I didn't even know that I will have to live like this when we first started dating. And more over, she is in a generally similar situation to me. Last semester she only took one class. But she still has to do it again. And now she is not taking any classes at all (aka a gap sem). Which is of course fine if she feels like she needs it. She quit her job that she had for only 2 weeks, and she also lives with her mom. But at least she has a car. What am trying to say is, we both need to get our shit together. But I also understand that as a guy I probably have more of an expectation for that. So I do understand that she is handling me a lot. But this is exactually what confuses me.

Basically, for the 4 months that we have been seeing each other. She never suggested doing anything, not even once. In fact we barely talk if I don't text first. At first she wouldn't text me at all except if I text first. Until I expressed that I would like her to sometimes. And now I guess she might do it from time to time. But it still feels like I am carrying the conversation. She doesn't even suggest doing things online. Like she is into games like Val and League. But we only played together once, and it was when I asked. Even tho these are her interests, so I thought it would make sense for her to introduce me to them, no? I figured if she actually had a good time maybe she would bring it up again, like say that we should play again sometime. Is that wrong to expect? She also randomly ghosts me for weirdly long times. Like sometimes she responds quickly. But too often she ghosts me for 16 or 18h. It's always a gamble if she will even respond in the same day. The break ended almost 2 weeks ago. Before it ended, I bought us tickets to the movies before my flight back to the US. When I asked her out over text. She seemed surprised that I asked her out only 3 days from then. Yet she still didn't even ask me when my flight is. Which is a 28h transit flight across 3 continents btw. So I thought she would care? My friends asked me for my flight code to track me. But she didn't even ask when my flight was, so it felt a little weird Idk. In fact when I was trying to buy the tickets, I asked her what time works for her. She responded about 5 hours later when I was already in the airport abt to take off. I still bought them then and there. Then when I texted her back that I did. I only heard from her again after 2 8h flights through europe. She texted me back when I was on an internal flight in the US. When I was sitting in the plan right before it took off. I still answered her then. She wasn't even aware I just had the previous 2 flights because she never cared to ask. I guess it just feels weird to me that I can answer her even while literally on a plan abt to take off. But she takes that long to answer me while she is just sitting at home.

Anyways, we did end up going to the movies. But that's basically the only thing we did ever since break ended 2 weeks ago. I asked her out to go bowling but we delayed indefinitely because she doesn't like driving in the snow (we also delayed going to the movies a day for the same reason). I was abt to go out with my friends on the weekend, so I asked if she wanted to come with us. She said yes at first. But then canceled. I also told her again that am still down to go bowling whenever she wants. But she didn't even acknowledge that text. And never really told me that she wants to do it after that so I just dropped it. We where still texting tho. She was telling me that she doesn't answer sometimes because her sleep schedule is fucked, because she is both depressed and anemic. She been telling me that she been going through some hard personal things too. But would never tell me what it is when I ask her abt it in more detail.

Now usually, If I am in such a case, I will take the hint that the girl isn't that interested pretty early on and just end it. Like way earlier than this. But it is especially confusing now. Because when ever we do see each other. We would almost always make out or have sex and she would be seemingly into it. I don't push her at all if she isn't comfortable, am too anxious to do so at any rate. After we went to the movies we had sex in the back seat of her car, and she almost initiated it herself after I told her that I can't take her back to my place. She also did put up with a lot of my trauma dumping and family problems last semester when I was suicidal. And I don't have a car. So she used to drive to come to my place. And we would usually watch a movie or play a game and end up making out or having sex. So this signaled to me that she does like me? But on the other hand, her never suggesting to do things herself. And the weird distancing and coldness is making me feel like she doesn't like me??? I am genuinely so confused. We had an argument over text and on a discord call. But then I told her let's just go get coffee and talk abt it in person. Then she also delayed doing that for a day like you can't make this shit up haha. I guess I feel it sounds bitchy for a guy to tell a girl to put effort in, as it is usually a complaint that goes the other way around. And I also feel like if I have to ask for it, then I already have my answer. But Ig it's the mixed signals that really fuck with my brain. Idk if how she acts should be normal and maybe am just expecting too much too early???

Ok, idk this is so fucked and tangled up in it's self. Would appreciate if someone gives me input, even tho I don't even know how anyone can digest or analyze this fucking mess. I think am cooked lol.

1ie90br,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ie90br,"[Update] Uni and Kilim, a few weeks in","So I have been living with Uni and Kilim for a few weeks now.
Here is how things are going! (Sorry for the long post, rat tax is provided accordingly).


Any feedback, criticism and advice welcome!
Also, any praise to both those two cuties will be duly forwarded!

Cage:
One week after my precedent post, the Critter Nation cage arrived! Great! 

Now I understand why everyone is recommanding it. It's well designed and well built, definitely worth paying extra for it.
I've started decorating it and adding stuff to it but it's still a process.

Here is what they have:

- 4 lava ledges for nail trimming. They are placed strategically under the water dispensers so that they have to use it at least a few times each day.

- Water bottles. I wish I had known that water bottles are not created equal. Two of the ones I bought first are wholly useless. Why is it so hard to design decent water bottles? The ones I settled for now are much better thanksfully, but still. The large one I bought doesn't fit the bars and a smaller one was broken after a week.

- Loads of cardboard: I built a few tunnels, ramps and homes with cardboard from the many boxes we received with all their stuff. Interestingly it's really what they seem to love and use most.

- A dig box: also made of cardboard. I put wood chips in, covered with timothy hay, with a weight at the bottom to prevent it from tipping over. They don't seem to care much for the hay but they do rumage in it if I put food in it. They are not too excited by the concept it seems.

- Rope: as a way to get from one place to the next in the cage. They don't seem to like the fact that it's not very steady and they mostly ignore it. I will have to think of something else.

- Ledges and rigid rope perches: I have different size and materials for the ledges, from cardboard to different types of wood. They seemed more excited by it in the beginning but I rarely see them climb them now (they prefer climbing the cage bars to navigate vertically). I often hide some treats on the ledges as motivation for them to climb and they do get eaten everyday so I guess they still see some use.

- Hideouts: on top of the three cardboard ones they use most for nesting, they also have a wooden one that is unfortunately a bit too small that they only chew at. There is also a larger wicker one that is maybe too large but they do use it as a food cache.

- Toys: they have three foraging balls that I stick treats in each meal, but they often don't care. Also, I added stick chews that see irregular use, as well as hanging chew toys that seem to have more success. Uni really likes the sepia bone, Kilim not so much.

- Hammocks: the Sputnik! Probably Uni's favorite place, especially since we added fleece towels to make it more cozy. She often sleeps there. There is also another fleece hammock but I've never seen them use it. Maybe it's poorly placed since it's on the lower tier?

- fleece towels. A recent addition. Unfortunately the wooden chips  adhere to it like crazy so they don't stay clean for long and are a pain to clean afterwards. They like moving them around but they prefer paper for bedding.

- Litter boxes: one for each level, after seing that just one was not sufficient to prevent them from defecating everywhere and anywhere. Since the new litter box entered service it's slightly better.

- Bedding: aspen wood chips. It gets EVERYWHERE. My only issue with critter nation is that the bottom of the trays is so shallow. The bedding just flies around and covers the floor around the cage. I want to try something else. I really would like to find some cellulose-based bedding like Biofresh or Alpha dry +, since after researching it it seems to be the absolute best, but I don't know if it can be bought by regular non scientist people. Any advice on that?

- Litter: recycled paper ferret litter. It does a great job at keeping odors under control, so that's great! For some reason they love to use the litter as a food cache and usually like to eat there too... No idea why.

- Fall breaking: to prevent dangerous falls I made sure that the risky areas had either crumple-able cardboard or the dig-box below. I witnessed one fall from the higher level, thanksfully nothing bad, and improved the safety since. Once we get more stuff to equip the cage it should get better.

Health:

Both are female.

Uni eats ANYTHING, Kilim on the other hand is quite picky. When they arrived Kilim was slightly larger than Uni but the balance has reversed totally since then.

Here is their weight curve, assuming they were 6 weeks old when they arrived.

Week 7:
Kilim: 155 g
Uni: 162 g

Week 8:
Kilim: 162g
Uni: 173g

Week 9:
Kilim: 189g
Uni: 202g

From the tables I found, Kilim is on the lower end of the range and Uni on the higher end. I suspect that Uni is taking a larger part of the food in the cage. I've started monitoring Uni more closely because I suspect that she is more likely to overeat. The biggest issue to discuss will be the diet.

Uni had a case of new home sniffles but it's gone now (at least I believe it is, she will sneeze from time to time but really rarely and she is otherwise really dynamic and energetic). I will also ask the vet to make sure.

Next vet checkup will be next week.


---
Main diet:

- The breeder's mix: Uni eats mostly anything in it so that's good, but Kilim only eats corn and a few seeds and rejects pellets. Definitely not optimal.

- Mazuri pellets: Uni stashes broken pellets but I don't think that she actively eats them. Maybe it's still too big relatively to her size? Kilim doesn't even aknowledge their existence.

 Still on the fence about what I should do for the main diet...

Treats:

- Sunflower seeds. They would kill for the stuff. They have a one gram a day allowance (shell included) mostly used as training incentive or to ""make them happy"" when we interact with them.

- Gerber puffs. Another treat they enjoy, only given during freeroaming. They eat both banana and peach flavored puffs and don't seem to have a clear preference. It is less motivating than sunflower seed however.

- Dried chicken / dried deer: they receive up to one treat a day. They don't really like the chicken but they do like the deer, especially Uni.

- Dried fish: another punctual treat, both like it but not to the level of sunflower seeds or puffs.

- Yoghurt: total bust they don't show any interest in yoghurt at all.

Veggies and fruits:
They get one fresh vegetable/fruit source each day. Here is what I found out.

- Banana: depending on their mood they will either eat it readily or ignore it totally. They do love mashed banana delivered by feeding syringe.

- Blueberries: rather successful especially when put in the water bowl to scoop. They don't eat a ton of it but they enjoy it when it's there.

- Kumquat flesh: at first they shown no interest in it, but the second time around they were really into it. Go figure.

- Carrot: a successful staple. They eat it readily and don't usually have leftovers.

- Apple: another bust. They don't like it and usually just push it away from the veggie plate. A slight dip in honey and they will eat it though.

- Broccoli: the messier the better. They love broccoli and they love that it just leaves crumbs everywhere. 

- Coriander: another very successful veggie. Usually we will use it as a training treat since it's a really strong motivator for them.

- Mint: also succesful, less than coriander though. 

- Cucumber: a solid veggie that they will readily eat, unfortunately it's usually not a great motivator and will not really work as a treat. Usually there are no leftovers.

---

Behaviour:

After a few weeks there is already a lot to see, a lot to learn too!

Uni:
- Very ""puppy-like"". Loves to play and fool around
- Eats everything and eats a lot.
- Risk-taker. A big change from the early days. Uni used to be the more cowardly of the two and avoid climbing or jumping. That changed totally and now it's the opposite. She will take jumps, climb hands and shoulders without hesitation, go into the""weighing box"" for a treat and explore everywhere during freeroaming.
- ""Bully"". She usually initiates wrestling bouts with Kilim, when they were smaller she would usually lose but now the weight advantage is starting to pay off. She will also steal food from Kilim's mouth.
- Handling-shy. Uni doesn't like being lifted and will recoil from it more actively than Kilim. I'm working on it with treats and training in general but it's still a work in progress.
- Likes toys and to play chase with chew sticks or human hands.
- Hoppity. Uni jumps and scoots around everytime we start an interaction or initiate free roaming. She gets very excited.
- Pro stasher: anything that's hard or large to eat will get stashed away. Usually in the litter box.

Kilim:
- More ""serious"" or catlike.
- Quite neophobic and scaredy
- Usually calmer and more prudent
- Will not climb hands, may climb sleeves with the proper motivation and with hesitation.
- More comfortable being handled. She will not struggle or try to wiggle away from a handling though she would prefer being left on the ground, thank you very much.
- No interest in play, will prefer doing her own exploring
- Nest architect. Kilim has redesigned her cardboard box to her specs with lots of shredded paper, built a backdoor for easy access to the back of the cage and usually stashes a few crumbs inside. She is much more motivated by nesting material than Uni.

---

Training and freeroaming

Training is done mainly during freeroaming during short 5 minutes sessions and from time to time with an open cage.
Since this week, freeroaming is done once a day in the evening when both are most awake and for around one hour.

- Vet-training. Right now since they both still show discomfort being handled and lifted, I focus on weighing training (put them in the weighing box and treat). Unfortunately one time Kilim tipped the box over and got frightened so that's a setback with her. It's moving along quite well for Uni.

- Name training: Saying their name and treat on reaction. No reliable response for now. Uni will react to voice to get a treat but without any concern to what is actually being said. I get the feeling that Kilim ""gets it"" a bit more but it's still very much a work in progress.

- Litter training: a few breakthroughs recently during freeroaming, but accidents are still frequent. They have constant access to their original small cage and litter box during free roaming. Kilim is the most reliable of the two, Uni shall poo wherever and whenever she pleases. However after a ""put in litter box immediately after accident"", Uni looked like she had a eureka moment and finished her business in the litter box.

- Trust building: when tired during free roam, Kilim will nest close to us and snuggle, clean herself and eventually fall asleep (with one eye open most of the time still). Uni usually doesn't rest easily during free roam but she will sleep anywhere in the cage, even in the open, unlike Kilim who will prefer sleeping in a tight nest. When Uni sleeps she really sleeps, eyes fully closed. Both do not show a dislike to being stroked or scratched softly, Kilim even seems to enjoy it when she is tired and resting.

- Clicker training: click then treat. Still doing the ""loading"" of the clicker. They seem to understand that click means treat but it doesn't mean that they will reliably react when prompted.

--- 

Issues and questions:

- How did you teach your rats their names? How long did it take? How reliable is a call to get a reaction from them?
- Area control : during free roam there are areas that while safe could allow them to access unsafe areas if we are not vigilent enough, so we would like to keep them away from them. For now we remove them while saying ""no"" or handblock them when they try and go there, but it just seems to exacerbate their curiosity about said area. Any advice?
- Vet handling/checkup. How long did it take you to teach your rats to tolerate handling enough to perform a visual and manual checkup? Any advice on how to proceed?
- How do you deal with a picky eater? 
- Fleece hammock placement: where would be the best spot?
- How to get some research-grade bedding? Do you know if Shepherd or Biofresh sell to non-professionnals?
- Do you notice anything I'm doing wrong or poorly that I should change ASAP?

- Panic sounds: I found out that some sounds acually scare the living hell out of them: the shaking of paint spray bottles with a bead in it. Of course I only use aerosols outside but wow I didn't expect them to run for their dear lives from that sound. So now I shake my paints outside too. They really dislike plastic bags too.

On the other hand the vacuum cleaner and coffee mill do not scare them and rather seem to intrigue them.

That's all! They are lovely, adorable, awesome and a lot to handle!

1ie8xvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1ie8xvt/study_break_story/,Study Break Story,"Ok so I fucking read at Powell and walked back an hour ago. My neighbor has his door open from probably the time he ordered a doordash and forgot to close it. So I'm walking by in the hall...tbh I don't like to watch a lot of TV and I couldn't help but notice the hot weather lady presenting the news. So I sat down on Dooler's couch hoping he hadn't used it as some casting couch earlier in the day.

And then after like fucking...5 minutes the weather segment ended and I browsed some channels, promising myself to wash my hands as soon as possible. I saw some really good senior citizen shows listed. I'm talking shit like Golden Girls and another one called Nurses. We watched an episode and Golden Girls involves sex life of older women before Sex and the City made it a thing, except this show has a soul...it brings the audience into the situational moment when one of then is getting embarrassed (I think the laugh track is actually a good thing to have).

This was a study break I needed for a nice half hour to unwind. In fact, it's inspired me....our senior population has grown and yet most shows many of us like to talk about involve high schoolers (Stranger Things and other Netflix shit)....what the hell?!

I oughta fucking...invite the geezers to Dooler's couch or somehow find some ways to stream these kinds of shows to the geezers I occasionally visit at the nursing home. They could relate and find solace in knowing there are popular cool hip people their age. But I'm not gonna visit them after exams just to show a tv show. When I go visit, I'll take a prop like photos of my faculty to analyze their habits, or my guitar to play dirty songs (there are even some old dirty songs they like). Sometimes I end uo gathering the guys at the poker table and like to ask then who they would rather at the senior home (staff and their neighbors). Maybe at the end I can pass off a suggestion to their director to play these shows and have then start a writing campaign to bring such shows back.

Nurses takes place in a hopsital....a place where seniors frequent and it has a lot of heart showing the nurses have lives too despite their demanding jobs. I'm tired of seeing 20 somethings pretending to be high schoolers, in a way it sets a bad example for us. 

Back to the geezers, the ladies will sometimes join us and just listen and laugh to themselves. Their generation was something else...folks had to really learn how to dance and fix things to impress each other. And sometimes when I get a booty call from one of your moms, she'll tell me her door or something needs to be fixed but that's not the only reason she's calling me late at night! I'm hungry too so I like free dinner and rockin' body. 

Enough of sharing my post midterm bucket list. Finna go on the rooftop in my underwear and let the cold moon shine on my slick ponytail while I may grab a coffee to study some more.

Fucking...try to study right after class like I do because you're in the mindset of it. If you go to the gym, that's it...u might as well sleep a few hours and then get up to study. I hit the gym in the mornings for that pump before class!

# Introduction

As far off paintings turns into the new norm, businesses and professionals are finding methods to build meaningful relationships past digital interactions. Virtual office spaces offer convenience and flexibility, but in addition they present challenges in¬†[cultivating¬†](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/5370866393992555102/3071756030597010914#)genuine human connections. To keep collaboration, engagement, and corporation way of life, it's miles important to put into effect strategies that inspire personal interactions beyond the display.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/71j0333uy9ge1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=480ad40bd04a9b55182c0624483360189d90a9f0

**1. Encourage Informal Interactions**

¬†In a bodily workplace, personnel interact in casual conversations by means of the water cooler or during lunch breaks. Virtual offices can mirror those reviews through introducing casual chat channels, digital coffee breaks, and social hours. These activities allow team contributors to bond over shared pursuits and foster a feel of camaraderie.

**2. Organize virtual team-fielding**¬†

Activities Being engaged in team-building exercises can strengthen relationships in remote environment. Hosting online games, Trivia Nights, or collaborative challenges can help team members to join the settings comfortably. Additionally, encouraging participation in virtual welfare activities such as meditation sessions or fitness challenges can promote welfare while increasing teamwork.

¬†**3. Open video and voice communication**¬†

Lesson-based communication can sometimes feel indiscriminate, causing misunderstanding or lack of emotional relationship. Encouraging video calls for meetings, one-on-one check-in, and interaction in churning sessions may be humanized. Voice messages and virtual town halls also contribute to more individual and attractive communication experience.

**4. Create opportunities for cross-team cooperation**¬†

Employees often feel isolated in virtual work environment. To combat this, organizations should promote cross-functional cooperation. Employees can increase teamwork to hand over other state projects, mentorship programs, or rotation to large systems and help employees to create new connections.¬†

**5. Identify and celebrate achievements**

¬†Accepting employee contribution promotes morale and strengthens the workplace bond. A virtual setting can cause a feeling of regular milestones, birthdays, and a sense of work related to the work. Organizations can use digital recognition platforms to highlight achievements and encourage colleagues.

**6. Promote the culture of open communication**¬†

Building connection beyond the screen requires an atmosphere of trust and transparency. Encouraging employees to express their thoughts, ideas and concerns in open forums promotes inclusion. Regular response sessions and anonymous survey managers can help gauge the team's spirit and increase communication.¬†

**7. Establishment of virtual co-compensation**¬†

Some employee thrives in collaborative settings, and the virtual offices can make it convenient through digital co-functioning places. The platforms that allow employees to work together in real time, such as virtual colleagues help to re -create the spirit of a shared office atmosphere, room or concentrated work session.

# conclusion¬†

Virtual office locations require deliberate efforts to promote connections beyond the screen. By giving priority to informal interactions, team-building activities, personal communication and culture of recognition, businesses can create an attractive and connected remote work environment. Investment in these strategies not only enhances cooperation, but also strengthens workplace relations, which leads to a more productive and satisfied workforce.",1,1738305545.0,u_heileyoffices,0,1.0,False
1ie8t5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ausguns/comments/1ie8t5h/shooters_union_media_release_gun_control/,Shooters Union Media Release: Gun Control Australia Report Misses The Mark,"**\*\*MEDIA RELEASE\*\***

**GUN CONTROL AUSTRALIA REPORT MISSES THE MARK**

¬†A controversial Gun Control Australia report into Australian firearms ownership has been savaged by one of the country‚Äôs largest responsible firearm user groups, who have criticised it for being misleading and politically motivated.

The [*Gun Control in Australia* report](https://australiainstitute.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1606-Gun-control-in-Australia-report-WEB.pdf), commissioned by Gun Control Australia and an organisation calling itself the Australian Gun Safety Alliance, makes alarmist claims about the state of Australia‚Äôs gun laws, including suggesting they are somehow deficient because unlicensed people can shoot at an established range under supervision.

Shooters Union Australia president Graham Park said the report was clearly furthering an agenda, and questioned its timing ahead of the upcoming Federal election.

‚ÄúEveryone ‚Äì including politicians ‚Äì knows that 99% of all firearm-related crime is committed by criminals without a gun licence, using illegally obtained firearms that were likely smuggled in from overseas or simply never registered in the first place.

‚ÄúCriminals do not obey gun laws or restrictions. They never have, and never will. Our firearms legislation and political discourse needs to reflect that, and it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äì partly because of reports like this one.‚Äù

He criticised the report of spreading misinformation and fear in the community about the nature of Australia‚Äôs incredibly strict gun laws.

‚ÄúThe majority of people outside the shooting community have absolutely no idea what are gun laws are, and entirely too many people seem to think it‚Äôs like parts of the US where you can buy whatever you like over the counter, the same as you would a cup of coffee.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing like that. Getting a licence takes months and requires a police background check ‚Äì which factors in a person‚Äôs general character as well as their criminal and even traffic history - and then for *every single firearm* a licensee wishes to purchase, they need a permit from the police.

‚ÄúYou cannot own a gun for self-defence in Australia, you cannot own a gun just because you think they‚Äôre cool, you cannot carry a gun around in public, and guns must be kept locked in a gun cabinet.

‚ÄúAs a result, the number of licensed firearms owners who commit crimes with their guns is absolutely tiny ‚Äì which is why they get so much media attention,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe statistical evidence shows firearms related crime has decreased over the past 20 years ‚Äì the [Australian Institute of Criminology](https://www.aic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-06/sr46_homicide_in_australia_2022-23_v3.pdf) reported last year that only 11% of Australian homicides in 2022-23 involved a firearm ‚Äì considerably lower than the 17% of homicides involving a firearm between ¬†1989/90 and 2021/22.

‚ÄúThe [NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (BOSCAR) statistics](https://bocsar.nsw.gov.au/topic-areas/weapons.html) also show the number of murders, attempted murders, assaults and robberies involving firearms or knives have been decreasing over the past two decades.‚Äù

He also criticised the report for failing to highlight any of the positive benefits of responsible firearms ownership and use ‚Äì including the community connections shooters build, the mental health benefits from shooting and hunting, the biosecurity benefits from feral pest control, and the significant economic benefits to rural Australia from hunting activities.

The Surprising Length of All Cables in the World | Hint: It‚Äôs A LOT more than you think!,"Ever wondered how many kilometers of wire and cable are scattered across the globe? We‚Äôre talking about the hidden lifeblood of modern society: the cables that power our devices, connect us across continents, and even stretch beneath oceans.

[How Much Wire Is Out There? ](https://preview.redd.it/rxbph8jjx9ge1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81806c65bc25f6903fda06cb065af3f3bd73315a)

In this article, we‚Äôre going to dive deep into the total length of all wires and cables in the world, and trust me, the numbers are going to blow your mind.

**Electricity: The Lifeblood of the Planet**

Let‚Äôs start with something simple: electricity. The global power grid is like the nervous system of the planet, sending power from power stations to your home, your workplace, and your favorite coffee shop. But have you ever stopped to think about how far those wires stretch?

**The world‚Äôs high-voltage transmission lines are already stretching across an impressive 10 million kilometers**. That‚Äôs enough wire to wrap around the Earth at the equator about 250 times!

And these aren‚Äôt just any wires. They carry electricity from power stations to cities and towns, running through the landscape, often on tall pylons. When you flip a switch to turn on a light, you‚Äôre tapping into a vast, invisible network that covers millions of kilometers.

Next up, let‚Äôs talk about the internet. That little thing we all rely on daily for everything from work to entertainment. How do all those cat videos and memes travel around the world? You guessed it: wires.

**The world‚Äôs fiber-optic cables alone stretch an estimated 100 million kilometers**. And if you‚Äôve ever used the internet to stream a movie, check your emails, or even post a meme, you‚Äôve probably used these cables.

Some of these cables aren‚Äôt even on land‚Äîthey‚Äôre laid underwater, connecting continents with data highways. **For example, submarine cables running across the ocean floor can stretch over 20,000 kilometers in a single stretch.** Imagine how far that is‚Äîit‚Äôs like crossing the entire Atlantic‚Ä¶ over 10 times.

Now, let‚Äôs take a look at the wires inside our everyday devices. You might not realize it, but there are wires literally everywhere in your life. Every device you use, from your phone to your car, contains miles of tiny cables.

There are over 1 billion smartphones in use worldwide, each packed with wires and circuits. And let‚Äôs not forget about your TVs, computers, and home appliances, all of which also have their own set of wires running through them. Electric cars are another growing example, with more wiring needed to power everything from the motor to the charging ports.

When you add it all up, the total length of wiring inside all our devices could easily stretch into the hundreds of millions of kilometers. And that‚Äôs not counting the wires inside your fridge, microwave, or the thousands of miles of electrical wiring inside office buildings.

Now, let‚Äôs put these numbers into perspective.

**The Earth‚Äôs circumference at the equator is about 40,075 kilometers. If we were to take all the wires and cables in the world and line them up, we could wrap them around the Earth‚Ä¶ millions of times!**

That‚Äôs right‚Äîan unbroken line of wire stretching across the entire planet, over and over again. Just think about how massive this network really is.

Even though wireless technology is rapidly advancing with things like 5G networks and Wi-Fi, cables are still essential to our way of life. In fact, they‚Äôre more important than ever.

For example, 5G networks rely heavily on fiber-optic cables for smooth, high-speed communication. Electric vehicles and smart homes are pushing the need for more wiring to connect and power everything. Plus, emerging technologies like satellite internet and the Internet of Things (IoT) are only going to add to the demand for more cables.

Even as wireless technology becomes more prominent, cables remain the unsung heroes behind the scenes, making sure everything works seamlessly.

It‚Äôs clear that the demand for wiring isn‚Äôt going to slow down anytime soon. If anything, it‚Äôs only going to increase. As cities become more connected, cars become smarter, and our homes get more automated, the length of wires in the world is only going to grow.

So, the next time you plug in your phone or turn on a light, think about all those invisible wires stretching across the world, making it all possible. Who knows, by 2030, we might have even more wire than we can imagine!

In the end, the total length of all wires and cables in the world is nothing short of astonishing. From the miles of power lines above our heads to the tiny copper threads inside our devices, the entire world is connected through these vast networks of cables. So, next time you plug in, connect, or charge, take a moment to appreciate the incredible system that makes it all happen!",1,1738305205.0,BusinessInsightsNews,0,1.0,False

I can‚Äôt give too much detail as I‚Äôm worried someone I know may see this and I may die of embarrassment. 

So I (20sF) have a crush on my guy coworker. I don‚Äôt know anything about him except for the fact that he‚Äôs a college student like me and he just so happens to look like one of my celebrity crushes. For the past two or so months it seems he and I have been playing this game of eye tag that I‚Äôm sure neither of us is winning. 

I first saw him several months ago talking to a coworker from a different department. He looked cute from a distance but I‚Äôm also blind as a bat so I wasn‚Äôt sure. I later asked my coworker about the guy and he said he was just some guy from another department. He brought up the fact that he looked like a pretty popular movie franchise character which caused my curiosity to spike since I‚Äôm a big fan of the actor. I stopped by the department later that day to see if i could get a better look. For reference, I‚Äôm pretty chill and confident when it comes to approaching people and trying to start a conversation and I‚Äôve interacted with celebrities enough to be casual about it. So in this moment I did what I normally do when talking to people: I walked up, smiled, and said hi. I asked him if he was the character look-a-like guy and he smiled back saying yes. It was when he smiled that I thought ‚Äúholy shit, this guy‚Äôs cute‚Äù. From that moment on I‚Äôve been an awkward mess around this guy. 

I told my friend about it and she somehow convinced me to invite him with us for drinks during the holiday. I happened to see him alone during work one day so I said fuck it and went up to him. I said hi, he smiled and asked me for my name considering I ran away during our first conversation. I managed to remember what my name was and tell him and then I somehow babbled out a sentence that I assumed was coherent enough for him to see I was inviting him out. He mentioned he already had plans with friend but may be in the same area so I said ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôll see you around then‚Äù and ran off before I let the embarrassment of the rejection sit. Though I took it as a rejection, I kept it cool and I assumed he did too as the next day he smiled hello and I waved at him. 

Since then we‚Äôve said nothing to each other other except the occasional hi and I‚Äôm not sure how to proceed with that. I catch him stare at me a lot when I‚Äôm in his vicinity. It‚Äôs to the point where I can never get a good look at his face because I know our eyes will meet once I try. He looks like my celebrity crush so I thought that even with the rejection I could still look at him from afar. But no! His eyes are always watching me. Last week I passed by and said hi and it was like he was looking right through me. I didn‚Äôt know what the hell to do with that so I just walked away. Then the next day he passes me while I‚Äôm making coffee in the break room and says hi but by the time I fully processed who I was saying hi back to he was gone with the wind. 

From what I‚Äôve witnessed, he‚Äôs pretty fine and outspoken with the people he‚Äôs around. I‚Äôve witnessed him loud and laughing with them to the point I could hear it through my airpods. However when it‚Äôs me he just freezes and says nothing. Just looks at me with an occasional smile and wave (wave if I‚Äôm lucky). If he‚Äôs shy with me does that mean I should try and drop subtle hints to give him a nudge? I‚Äôm pretty awkward when it comes to dating and my experience can be a bit lackluster sometimes.

My concerns are 
1) I was hired to do a certain work but they expect me to do beyond contract obligations (that's nah-ah for me bc I'm not paid to do that, and breach of contract from client)

2) the above breach of contract is tolerated by our manager to make it seem that we are accepting every single requests from the client = performance boost for IBM (how is this normal?)

3) manager always say yes as stated above. Then will complain about it afterwards but who ends up doing the work? Our team

4) To keep up with the work, we are encouraged to do unpaid overtime. By my manager's words ""if cannot be done during the weekdays, please complete it during the weekends"". We are only paid for 8hrs M-F 

5) when I asked for help, they always jokingly say ""you got to buy us coffee now bc of your many questions"" like I'm only 2 months in with the project and they expect me to be a magician to complete tasks without asking help or gain familiarization with their documents and coding

Now all these factors above, I got hospitalized due to stress and lack of sleep, afraid that I'll look I'm underperforming compare to the other team members. This is the FIRST ever project that is really toxic for me. When I tried saying no to certain tasks, I'm scolded and threats my performance review or other bonuses. 

I just have enough of this so I'm thinking what should I do? Should I report this to HR directly or talk to my manager first as a gesture of respect (I want to avoid burning bridges as much as possible). Any suggestions are appreciated. ",3,1738304851.0,IBM,4,1.0,False

The secret? Leveraging AI-powered tooling (specifically Cursor IDE in Agent mode with YOLO enabled). Instead of manually rewriting code, the IDE automated file creation, command execution, and even handled framework adjustments while I‚Ä¶ well, sipped coffee and watched.  

This experience was a wake-up call about how much *strategic* AI adoption can accelerate repetitive technical work. What once felt like a weeks-long project became a Friday morning task, freeing up time for higher-impact work.  

A few takeaways:  
1. **AI isn‚Äôt magic**‚Äîit requires clear prompts and context.  
2. **Tooling maturity** matters (Playwright‚Äôs modern API + TypeScript‚Äôs type safety made the migration smoother).  
3. **Automation isn‚Äôt about replacing effort**‚Äîit‚Äôs about reallocating it.

I'm hoping you can give me some guidance on which business structure to go for in my circumstances. 

I'm looking to open a coffee trailer business that'll operate at events, and I'd like to run it alongside my fiance.

I'd likely be the one making more of the decisions, but overall it'd be a joint project and we'd both be working on the trailer at events. Once the initial investment of the trailer is paid off, I see no problem with us splitting the profits equally.



Here are some points for consideration:

- For tax purposes, I would like to register as self employed. I have a full-time job that I intend to keep, but it isn't keen on me working on other projects so ideally I'd like my tax code to stay the same!

- I will be the one making the initial financial investment (under ¬£10k) to get the business up and running.

- My fiance and I are already financially tied, we have a joint bank account and have a mortgage together (unsure if that's useful info, but thought I'd mention it!)


I've looked at a 'General partnership', which seems like it could be the best way to go? It essentially looks like being a sole trader (which I've done before) but with an extra person where everything is split equally. It feels like setting up a business where we're employees would be a bit overkill for what we're looking to do, and the tax code change that'd come for a second employment would also possibly jeopardise my full-time role.

Bonus question: If a 'General partnership' is right for our needs, would opening an additional personal joint account suffice? I can see that Monzo and Starling's free business accounts don't apply to general partnerships, and I've rather avoid paying monthly fees for a business account before I know if the business is going to generate any profit, haha!",2,1738304373.0,smallbusinessuk,8,1.0,False

SEATTLE‚ÄîThe University of Washington School of Law has proudly announced its new, more transparent motto: ‚ÄúRain, Debt, and Mild Disappointment,‚Äù in an effort to better manage the expectations of incoming students.

‚ÄúWe felt our old branding, ‚ÄòLeadership for the Global Common Good,‚Äô was misleading,‚Äù said Dean Foggy McCloud. ‚ÄúIt suggested that graduates would actually leave Seattle and that our job placement statistics were something to brag about. This new motto reflects the true UW Law experience: staring at the rain, accumulating debt, and hoping for a job that isn‚Äôt document review.‚Äù

The school also unveiled a new marketing campaign featuring local landmarks, including the law library‚Äîwhere students are often found staring out at the endless drizzle, questioning their life choices‚Äîand the Career Services Office, which now features a self-serve rejection letter printer to help students prepare for the real world.

In other news, UW Law confirmed that the curved grading system will remain in place. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great way to turn a 93% into a B-,‚Äù said Professor Socratic Cold-Call. ‚ÄúIt keeps students humble‚Äîand by humble, I mean questioning all of their life choices.‚Äù",6,1738304232.0,lawschooladmissions,0,0.87,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ie8iv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1ie8iv3/tea_has_been_a_major_source_of_comfort_for_me/,Tea has been a major source of comfort for me lately,"It seems silly to feel so much‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know enthusiasm, appreciation even, for a modest brewed beverage.

But, as I mentioned in today‚Äôs what‚Äôs in your cup, it‚Äôs been an awful year so far. There have been several things involved. But the biggest is that my heath has taken a major downturn. A previously well managed illness (post covid gastroparesis) has taken a turn and I‚Äôve been really sick. Poor appetite and sometimes I can‚Äôt even keep down what I eat. 

So eating is not really fun any more. I am kind of enjoying making smoothies which are a necessity in my life now. But there is still a utilitarian aspect to it.

I cut down on coffee because although it didn‚Äôt bother my stomach, it does seem too filling to have daily. That‚Äôs when my tea consumption bumped from 2-3 times per year, to now 1-3 cups daily. I‚Äôve been having a lot of fun trying new varieties, trying out tea lattes, even drinking ice tea which I didn‚Äôt like before. I have my first two packages of loose leaf tea coming Saturday which I‚Äôm really looking forward to.

This sounds kind of pathetic writing this out. Oh well. I think tea has become such a comfort because it is the one thing lately that I‚Äôve been able to consume for pure enjoyment. I don‚Äôt have to drink it as a ‚Äúgoal‚Äù to hit my needed calories. I don‚Äôt have to worry that I am going to throw it up later. I think this is really the first time I‚Äôve articulated and understood this ",37,1738304137.0,tea,4,0.98,False
