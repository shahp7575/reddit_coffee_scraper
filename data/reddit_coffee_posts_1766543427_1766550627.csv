if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

My thoughts were jumbled, but I could still listen.



“He was my servant,” Marcus continued, his voice soft, almost drowned out by the desert silence. “Everyone called him that. The law called him that. Society defined him that way. But to me, he was so much more than that; he was my childhood playmate, and…”



He grabbed a handful of sand, letting it slip through his fingers. “I never dreamed of marrying and having children. I never imagined having a wife, children, living the life my family expected. But I did dream of spending my life with Jacob. Growing old together, I wanted to buy an estate, and just the two of us, and endless hunting—my health would be poor then, and hunting would be my happiest time.”



The sand slipped through his fingers, and he watched it fall, a deep sadness filling his face.



“When they told me I was going to meet a woman I’d never met, and that my duty was to have children with her and continue the family bloodline, I couldn’t bear it. Not because of the woman—as far as I know, she’s a nice person. It was because they said Jacob couldn’t come with me. And I couldn’t continue my beloved medical career.”



“What happened after that?” I asked, though deep down I had a premonition.



“My illness got worse, coupled with my unwillingness, led them to call off the engagement.” His tone was calm, but I could hear the weight in it. “In my final moments, in that year when I teetered between life and death, I told myself I couldn’t die like that. I became obsessed with mysticism, I tried everything, summoning all the gods, because… I’m the youngest son of a noble family, I have the money to do it, my family just thinks I’m dying.”



He looked at me, his eyes aged, incredibly aged. “Ultimately, I chose this path. Seven hundred and forty-three years, traveling to remote places, watching the world change, yet I remained steadfast.”



“Do you regret it?”



His smile was sincere and painful. “Not at all. We spent another ten years together. I told my parents I'd found a very busy job in London, and then he got the plague, so I… I thought then, if the plague and famine were alike, I'd already tried everything, even to the point of ignoring Jacob. I could only seek out plague, because maybe I could have a chance.”



Halfway through the story, Levi, in his animal form, quietly approached. He rested his head on Marcus's lap, offering silent comfort in an animalistic way.



Marcus placed his hand on Levi's head, his fingers gently twirling his fur. “I made another deal, but this time it wasn't so lucky. He became some kind of being between life and death, and he doesn't remember me anymore. I had to trade a part of my feelings for some peace of mind.”



“That must have been hard,” I said.



Afterwards, the three of us sat quietly in the vast desert with Biscuit, the ancient skeleton casting long shadows on the sand.



That night, I dreamt of young Marcus, healthy and full of energy, standing in a stone house draped with tapestries. Jacob stood beside him, smiling, his face radiant. They stood close, yet didn't touch, but the space between them held all the unspoken emotions they couldn't express.



\-----

The second week was worse.



The heat seemed to come alive, enveloping us like a second skin. It now had weight, pressing down on my shoulders, making each breath incredibly difficult. The air was so hot that inhaling hurt; each gasp felt like burning my lungs.



The texture of the sand had changed, no longer like sand, but more like powder, fine as flour, light as ash. With each step the horses took, sand billowed into clouds, casting a pale film over everything. My skin was covered in sand, and my clothes stiffened. Sand seeped into my mouth, nose, and eyes, rough and inescapable.



We now saw more ""structure."" Less like buildings, more like the memories of buildings. Geometric shadows were cast on the sand, outlining the contours of walls and porches, but they had no substance. We rode across the dunes, unimpeded. I felt their emptiness, the places where people had once lived, loved, suffered, and died, now utterly deserted.



On the ninth day, we discovered the skull of our first truly gigantic creature.



We'd seen bones for days, but this one was different. The skull was the size of a house, perhaps even larger, half-buried in a dune hundreds of feet high. It was remarkably well-preserved, snow-white, with eye sockets large enough to fit a car. The teeth, the remaining fragments, were as long as me, worn smooth by centuries of erosion.



“What is that?” I asked hoarsely, my voice barely audible.



“It’s something that existed before the concept of ‘size’ existed,” Marcus said. “Before physics mandated uniformity. Things could be enlarged or shrunk as needed, and it didn’t matter.”



During the day, more and more bones appeared. Ribs, like the framework of a cathedral, arched overhead as we rode beneath them. Vertebrae, the size of buses, lay scattered across the sand like giants throwing dice. A spine stretching for miles, partially buried in the sand, formed a ridge we had to detour around, for traversing it would take hours.



The scale was unbelievable. My brain kept trying to comprehend what I was seeing, trying to imagine these bones belonged to real creatures, but this attempt undermined my ability to grasp size and space.



On the tenth day, Levi stopped moving.



We had camped the night before, and dawn broke. Or rather, barely dawn in the white sky. He was just curled up, lying there, his body rapidly shifting shape. Dog, fox, wolf, human child, and back to dog—the transformations happened so quickly I couldn't even see them clearly.



""Levi?"" I crawled to his side, my body barely able to move. “Hey, buddy, we have to keep going.”



He whimpered, his voice high-pitched and desperate, but his eyes remained closed.



“He’s reached his limit,” Marcus said softly. “Hunger is eroding his ability to maintain his form. Shapeshifters need more energy than humans to maintain their form, and he’s been running out of energy for days.”



“What do we do?”



“Pick him up.” Marcus had already gone to Levi’s horse, adjusting the saddlebag to make room. “Put him with Biscuits. They’ll comfort each other.”



I carefully picked up Levi; he was so light, as if hunger had consumed him entirely, and placed him in the saddlebag with Biscuits. The dog immediately curled up beside him, offering warmth and companionship.



Levi’s eyes opened briefly, his gaze hazy and unfocused. “Dad?”



“I’m here. Rest. We’ll get there.”



“Really?”



“Really.”



He closed his eyes, his breathing gradually calming. He seemed to enter a state of hibernation, his body shutting down non-essential functions to conserve its dwindling energy.



We continued on.



On the eleventh day, the scenery changed. We descended into a valley. But ""valley"" wasn't entirely accurate. It was more like a depression, a vast, bowl-shaped area in the desert, perhaps once a lakebed millions of years ago, perhaps never having held water. The sand here was a darker color, almost black, its surface covered with endless spirals and swirling patterns.



""Look closely,"" Marcus's voice was tense. ""Tell me what you see.""



I looked. At first, all I saw was patterned black sand. Then my eyes adjusted to the light, and I saw them.



Scales.



Those patterns weren't formed by wind erosion. They were scales. Huge scales, each as large as a house, overlapping in perfect geometry. The entire valley floor was covered in them, a vast, boundless reptilian armor stretching to every horizon.



We were walking on something enormous.



Something buried but not dead.



Something breathing with a rhythm measured in decades.



“Don’t think about it,” Marcus advised, his own voice hoarse. “Don’t try to comprehend the scale. You’ll break down. Just ride. Just stare at that cave.”



“A cave?”



He pointed ahead. In the center of the valley, about ten miles away, there was a jutting rock, the only vertical feature in the entire depression. At the base of the rock, barely visible even from this distance, was a dark opening.



“There,” he said. “That’s where we’re going. That’s where rebirth is.”



On the twelfth day, we descended into the valley, and the temperature plummeted. Not coolness, the coolness long gone, but another kind of heatwave. This heatwave came from below, radiating upwards through the scales, as if the creature beneath our feet had a fever, as if its massive body was battling some eternal infection.



The scales trembled slightly as we passed.



Not noticeably, not quickly. But I could feel it. A subtle movement beneath the horse's hooves, a flexion and descent, as if the creature below were adapting to our weight. This swaying stirred ripples in the valley floor, the pattern of disturbance spreading outwards from below. Our path.



My horse did not waver. He moved steadily forward, his black hooves carrying an unusual certainty, firmly planted on the scales. But I could feel his tension, the growing vigilance in his muscles. He knew what ground we were on. He knew danger.



We did not camp that night. Marcus insisted we continue, saying it was dangerous to stop on the scales, but he did not explain why. So we rode in the dark, though under the white sky, day and night were almost indistinguishable, the scales shifting beneath our feet, waves of heat rising, hunger devouring everything.



I was sometimes lucid, sometimes delirious, my body moving mechanically, my hands gripping the reins tightly by muscle memory alone. Sometimes I could feel the surrounding desert. Sometimes I felt as if I were elsewhere, a darker, colder, equally empty place.



On the morning of the thirteenth day, I looked down and found I could see through my hands.



Not quite. Not like ghosts. But they were translucent, slightly translucent, as if I were fading away. As if hunger had devoured not only my energy, but also my essence, my body.



“Marcus,” I said. “My hands.”



He glanced back, his expression turning serious. “You’re nearing the breaking point. That’s actually a good thing; it means you’re ready. It means the transition will be easier when the famine consumes you.”



“Easier? How so?”



“You’ve partially dissolved. You’re somewhere in between. The feeling of being devoured won’t be like destruction, but more like completion.”



I didn’t know if his words were comforting or terrifying.



On the fourteenth day, we reached the cave.



A rock jutted out like a tumor from the scales, a massive rock out of place with the surrounding geological formations. It was dark, almost black, with shimmering textures interspersed within, like obsidian or glass. The entrance to the cave was small, barely large enough for me to walk upright, perfectly circular, so perfect it seemed unnatural.



Marcus dismounted first, his movements still steady despite two weeks in the desert. He helped me down; I nearly collapsed. My legs felt like they'd forgotten how to support my weight. Hunger consumed me completely, an emptiness that swallowed all other senses.



He took Levi and biscuits from the saddlebag. Levi was still unconscious, his form somewhere between human and animal, his breathing shallow and steady. Bisket stirred, licked Levi's face, then looked at me with eyes full of patience and understanding.



""Can you walk?"" Marcus asked.



I nodded, though I wasn't sure if I really could.



""Let's begin then.""



We entered the cave.



The cave was smaller than I'd imagined, almost a room. The walls were smooth stone, worn smooth by hands, time, or something else, giving them a dull luster. In the center of the floor, a scale lay embedded in the rock like a fossil.



It was about the size of my palm, shimmering with iridescence, capturing non-existent light and reflecting it into unnameable colors. Green, yet not quite green; blue, yet almost purple; red, yet shifting to gold. Like the satchel, it pulsated with the same rhythm—a heartbeat, a breath, the most fundamental pulse of life.



Marcus carefully placed Levi and the biscuits against the wall; they huddled together, the warmth of the biscuits supporting Levi's swaying body. Then he turned to me.



“This is it,” he said softly, “the place of rebirth. Here, famine devours itself, then is reborn. Here, the cycle repeats.” He looked at me, his expression grave. “Are you ready?”



I pondered this question. Was I ready to be swallowed by one of the four anchors of reality? Ready to linger for three minutes in the existential hunger of my stomach? Ready to face whatever lay ahead?



“No,” I said honestly. “But I’ll still do it.”



“This is all anyone can ask for.” He stepped back, giving me space. “Open the bag. Put it on the scale. Then step back and let things take their course.”



My hands trembled, or perhaps not, or perhaps I couldn’t tell anymore. I opened the bag with fingers that felt like someone else’s.



Famine appeared.



It didn’t appear in the form of any creature. It didn’t appear as anything with a definite form. It was more like a lack shaped into intention. A void that had learned to move. A darkness beyond darkness, which devoured light not by absorbing it, but by destroying it, making the light believe it had never existed.



It flowed from the bag like liquid shadow, like oil solidified in nothingness. With its appearance, the cave filled with that emptiness, that hollow pain, that endless, insatiable longing. The hunger I had felt for the past two weeks paled in comparison. This was the source of hunger, its origin, its pure and undiluted essence.



That thing gradually took shape. I realized it was a snake, or something like a snake. Long and sinuous, it moved with a terrifying grace. Its scales, if they were truly scales, were a deeper black than black itself.



An ouroboros.



Its head was buried in its tail, devouring its own matter in an eternal cycle of destruction and rebirth. Devouring, and being devoured. End and beginning, start and end.



I placed the bag on the scale embedded in the floor.



Famine hovered on the scale, hovering around itself, forming a perfect circle. From head to tail, from beginning to end, and from end to beginning. It pulsed the same rhythm I had felt for the past two weeks, and now I understood—it wasn't a heartbeat. It was the pulse of the universe itself, the fundamental rhythm of existence, the beat to which all things dance, whether aware or not.



Then, it stopped devouring itself.



And turned to me.



I had expected fear. I had expected to run, to fight back, to resist with every last ounce of strength I had. But what I felt was recognition. Famine knew me. It had always known me. It had been waiting for me, waiting for this moment.



This was all destined to happen. This moment was etched into my blood, into my DNA, into the very root of my existence.Structure. I was born to stand in this cave, to offer myself to hunger in this moment.



It opened its mouth, and that mouth was also its tail, and the tail was itself; before such essential existence, all boundaries are meaningless.



I glanced back.



“Three more minutes,” Marcus called, his voice tinged with tension, perhaps fear, perhaps awe, perhaps both. “We’ll be here when you return.”



If I could return, I thought.



But I didn’t say it aloud. Instead, I took a step forward, and hunger devoured me.



Hunger vanished.



This was the first thing I noticed; it was so sudden, so complete, that it took my brain several seconds to process the emptiness. That gnawing emptiness, that nothingness that had occupied my consciousness for fourteen days, simply vanished. Not because it was filled, but because I became hunger itself, and hunger feels no lack.



I found myself in a vast, tranquil, utterly peaceful place.



This space was indescribable. It wasn't dark, yet there was no light. It wasn't empty, yet there was no scene in the traditional sense. It wasn't silent, yet there was no sound I understood. It was the gap between heartbeats, the pause between breaths, the perfect stillness before action begins.



From here, I can see everything.



Everyone who has ever longed for something. Every empty stomach. Every lonely heart. Every searching soul. They are all here, connected, all part of this vast network of desire, a network like invisible threads that bind the universe together.



The children in the refugee camp, bloated from malnutrition, dream of rice.



The widow in the suburban house longs to hear her husband's voice, longs to talk to him again.



The young people in the city apartment yearn for meaning, yearn for purpose, yearn to find something that makes the long days worthwhile.



The woman in the hospital bed longs for more time, even just a little more time with her family.



The artist gazes at the blank canvas, thirsting for inspiration, yearning to find that scene that can make everything meaningful.



The prisoners, held in solitary confinement, craved human connection so intensely that it became physical torment.



They were all here. Everything. All the hunger, desire, and desperate need that had existed or would exist. This network stretched backward, across time, forward, towards infinite possibilities, connecting all lives, sharing the experience of emptiness.



I finally understood the nature of famine.



It was not destruction. It was not cruelty. It was not punishment.



It was space for growth. It was an emptiness that allowed filling. It was a void that gave form to abundance.



I saw my father, young and desperate, standing at the warehouse door. He longed to escape his inner demons. He longed to find a way out. I understood; his hunger shaped me, created the space in which I existed. His emptiness gave me form.



I saw everyone I had ever delivered to—all those difficult, struggling customers—and I understood what they all longed for. Connection. Recognition. Acknowledging their existence, acknowledging their importance, acknowledging the meaning of their existence in the universe.



The things in the thirteenth-floor hospital yearn to reclaim the essence of their lost reality.



The castle-like creature in the well yearns to regain its former memories.



The subway passengers yearn to reach a destination they can never reach.



The old man telling stories yearns to find someone willing to listen to his warnings.



The gardener, situated between two places, yearns to comfort those lingering on the border.



We are all thirsty. We all forever yearn, all try to fill the void that can never be filled, for it is this emptiness that gives us life, gives us meaning, and elevates us beyond the static objects of a static universe.



Time flows here in a peculiar way. I can feel the second hand ticking away, one second, two seconds, three seconds, but each second contains infinity. In the first second, I experienced a thousand lives, felt every kind of thirst, every desperate longing, every hand reaching for the unattainable.



In the second second, I understood what Marcus had given me: Choice.



To stay is to dedicate oneself forever, becoming part of the machine that feeds the thirsty, maintaining boundaries, letting each world operate on its predetermined path. Or to leave is to return to a mundane life, memories bound, words imprisoned, carrying knowledge yet unable to share, unable to apply, unable to use it to shape anything beyond my own understanding.



Both choices are empty in their own way. They both create their own hunger.



To stay means eternal dedication, watching my loved ones age and pass away, while I remain unchanged, experiencing the slow fading of the connection brought by immortality. To live forever with a longing, watching the lives of others unfold in cycles, while I remain detached, serving them, providing them with convenience, yet never truly participating.



To leave means silence, yearning to know the truth yet unable to speak of it, unable to share it, unable to let it enlighten the world. To live with a full understanding and a lonely emptiness, carrying knowledge like a boulder in my heart, never to be lightened, for I can never put it down.



In the third second, I made my choice. It wasn't because I wanted to do it. It wasn't because I was ready. It wasn't because one choice was better, more correct, or more aligned with my true desires. It was because one desire touched me more clearly than another. An emptiness brought me more peace.



I chose the desire for immortality over the desire for silence. I chose eternal devotion over isolated cognition. I chose to remain, to be like Marcus, guarding the boundary between existence and non-existence, however long eternity may be.



Because levi needs stability. Because the biscuit is immortal anyway, and deserves a master who doesn't age. Because the universe needs food to feed its hungry beings.



Because I realized I was good at this. I followed the rules. I returned alive. I now understand that these are not merely survival skills—they are dedication. They are service. They are the willingness to enter nothingness and return again and again, bringing nourishment to those beings who cannot be self-sufficient.



Perhaps that is enough. Perhaps that is the mission. Perhaps that is how to fill the emptiness, not by erasing it, but by accepting it, living in it, and letting it function.



Famine liberated me.



I knelt in the cave, panting, my body rediscovering how to be an entity, how to separate, how to be an independent individual. The transformation back to a single existence was so dramatic, like rebirth, as if every atom of my being had to remember how to coalesce into a single point of consciousness.



The scales on the ground were gone. In their place stood new scales, brand new and gleaming with colors never before seen. They were ready for another sixty years of waiting, waiting for patience, waiting for the slow accumulation of time, until the next rebirth.



The ouroboros devoured itself and was reborn, and I was the catalyst, the transmission mechanism, the messenger that brought hunger to its own rebirth.



Marcus stood above me, extending his hand. His face was taut, with an emotion I couldn't describe. ""Welcome back,"" he said softly. ""Exactly three minutes and fourteen seconds. Congratulations, Eric, you've completed the final delivery.""



I took his hand, stood up, my legs almost forgetting how to support my weight. The hunger was gone, truly gone, no longer concealed or hidden. I felt a completely different kind of emptiness, clean and vast, like an empty bell, poised to receive whatever was to come.



levi shifted against the wall, slowly opening his eyes. When he saw me standing, alive, unharmed, he relaxed completely. His tail, now fully exposed, no longer shimmering, began to wag.



“You’re back,” he whispered, his voice hoarse, but still human. “I knew you would come back, but I was afraid you wouldn’t, but you really are back.”



Biscuit stood up, walked to my side, and pressed his warm, strong body against my legs, patient, loyal, and genuine.



I looked at Marcus. “So, what now?”



“Now, we formally present this proposal.” He took a step back, his posture formal but friendly. His expression was complex—relief, sadness, understanding, a mixture of emotions. “Eric, your contract has been fulfilled. You’ve served for three years, completed one final delivery. Now you have a choice: either pay off your debts and leave with fond memories, or accept the promotion, become a manager, and stay with us forever.”



“What if I accept the promotion?”



“You’ll become like me. Time flows differently for us, and aging hardly slows down. You’ll manage other couriers, mentor them through three years of service, and assign them tasks when they’re selected for final deliveries. You’ll witness the world change, while you remain the same. And you can never leave. Never retire. Never rest in the usual way. This service will become your existence, your purpose, your eternal present.”



“My choice is deep inside,” I said. “Just three seconds ago. I will stay.”



Marcus’s eyebrows rose slightly. “Are you sure? Do you understand what this means? Forever is a long time, Eric.”



“I understand. Someone has to do this job.”



Marcus was silent for a long time, his old eyes fixed on my face. Then he smiled, not the wide grin I was used to, but a gentler, more melancholic smile. “Choosing Eternity, the reasons are heavy.”



“The reasons for all great choices are heavy. That’s why they deserve our deepest consideration.”



“Well then, congratulations, Eric Appleby.” He pulled a business card from his pocket—I didn’t know where it came from, given we’d been in the desert for two weeks with extremely limited supplies—and handed it to me. “You’re a manager now. Welcome to Eternity.”



The handwriting on the card was exactly the same as his, elegant script on thick paper: Eric Appleby, Manager, Full-time Employee.



“Next week you’ll start training new delivery drivers,” he continued, “train them, mentor them, try to keep them alive, though many may not make it through the first month. Remember, you can no longer talk about this publicly online. No more online confessions. Work matters stay at work. Boundaries require you to act prudently.”



We rode across the desert, through the melting world, through suburbs and commercial streets, finally back to the city. The return journey seemed shorter; perhaps for me, time had become something I could freely control. The hunger gradually subsided until I could eat bread again, truly savor its taste, drink water, and feel refreshed.



The pocket watch on the coffee table displayed a new photograph: I stood in an office exactly like Marcus's, dressed in clothes that seemed too formal, too important. Behind me, reflected in the window, I could see that tall figure that had appeared in countless photographs.



But this time, I recognized him.



That was me. The me I was going to become. The manager. The eternal servant. The guardian of the borders.



I was about to start working.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

It was handwritten in blue ballpoint pen on the back of a tax receipt pinned to the bulletin board of a 24-hour laundromat in downtown São Paulo.

""NIGHT WATCHMAN - PRIVATE SECTOR. $18,000.00/month + Bonuses. Requirements: No family, military or security background, strong stomach. Discreet. Contact the number below via Telegram only.""

Eighteen thousand dollars.

I read the number three times. At the time, I was living in a boarding house room that smelled of mold and old cooking oil. My bank account had been in the red for so long the manager didn’t even call me anymore. I’m an ex-military police officer, expelled from the force for ""excessive use of force"" and ""incompatible conduct"" (official code for alcoholism).

I had nothing to lose. I sent the message.

The reply came in thirty seconds. A GPS coordinate and a time: 03:00 AM.

The location was the underground garage of an abandoned commercial building in the Sé district. I was frisked by two men built like wardrobes wearing cheap suits. They took my phone, my wallet, my watch. They put a black hood over my head and shoved me into the back of a van.

They drove for four hours. From the swaying and the smell of earth coming through the vents, we left the city and hit a dirt road. Then, we went down. We went down a lot. I felt the pressure in my ears change, like when a plane lands.

When the hood was removed, I was in a white, sterile room lit by fluorescent bulbs.

Sitting at a metal table was Dr. Arantes. A thin man with gray skin and dark circles under his eyes so deep they looked like bruises. He didn’t smile. He didn’t greet me. He just pushed a stack of papers toward me.

“Level 5 Non-Disclosure Agreement,” he said, his voice dry as sand. “If you tell anyone what you see here, you don’t go to jail. You disappear. Your dental records vanish. Your birth certificate is erased. You never existed. Understood?”

“What is the job?” I asked, holding the pen. “Politician security? Organ trafficking?”

“Theological Containment Monitoring.”

I laughed. I thought it was a joke.

Arantes didn’t laugh.

“The salary is deposited into an offshore account in the Cayman Islands. You work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. You sleep here. You eat here. Your life outside is over. Sign or leave.”

I signed. My hand shook a little, not from fear, but from alcohol withdrawal.

Arantes gathered the papers and stood up.

“Welcome to Project Cathedral. Let’s go down.”

We entered an industrial freight elevator. The panel had no numbers, just an up button and a down button. We descended for too long. Two minutes? Three?

“We are three hundred meters below the foundation of an 18th-century church,” Arantes explained, staring at the elevator ceiling. “The church above is a façade. What matters is what’s below.”

When the doors opened, the air was freezing. We walked down a concrete corridor lined with steel doors fitted with biometric locks. We reached the end of the hall. A control room.

It was small, claustrophobic, filled with high-resolution monitors, panels with blinking lights, and an industrial coffee maker. But the focus of the room was the window. A pane of reinforced glass, ten centimeters thick, looking into a gray concrete cell.

“That is your post,” Arantes pointed to the worn leather chair in front of the glass. “Sit.”

I obeyed. I looked through the glass.

The cell was a perfect concrete cube, maybe 4x4 meters. No furniture. No bed. No toilet. In the center, on a Persian rug that must have once been red but was now dark brown, a man was kneeling.

He was facing away from me. He wore a black cassock, torn and dirty. His hair was white, thin, falling over his gaunt shoulders. He was rocking his body slightly, back and forth.

“Who is he?” I asked.

“We call him Father Thomas. He is 94 years old. He has been in that room for forty-two years.”

“A prisoner?”

“Working. Just like you.”

Arantes flipped a switch on the panel. Sound invaded the control room.

It wasn’t silence. It was a low, constant hum, like a swarm of bees inside a cave.

“...Khlerrr-thum-nagh... Sssrr-aaa-tuh... Mmm-glll-w'nah...”

“Is he praying?” I asked, feeling a chill run up my spine. That language didn’t sound human. The consonants were too hard, too guttural.

“He is vocalizing,” Arantes corrected. “It’s a sonic blockade. A specific frequency. As long as he maintains this rhythm, the Door stays closed.”

“What door?”

Arantes ignored the question and pointed to the panel in front of me. There were three large buttons, protected by acrylic covers. Blue, Yellow, and Red.

“Pay attention, Jonas. These are your only responsibilities. The priest does not eat, does not drink water by mouth, does not sleep. He receives nutrition and stimulants intravenously. He wears high-absorption geriatric diapers that we change with robots every 24 hours. Your function is to ensure he does not stop. Ever.”

Arantes pointed to the Blue Button.

“Hydration and mild stimulant. If his voice falters, if he coughs, press Blue.”

Then he pointed to the Yellow Button.

“Shock of adrenaline and pure amphetamine. If he stops rocking. If his head droops. If it looks like he’s going to pass out. Press Yellow. It will hurt him a little. His heart will race to 200 beats per minute. But it will keep him awake.”

“And the Red one?” I asked. The button was larger than the others, with a black and yellow striped warning border.

Arantes looked at the cell. For the first time, I saw fear in that man’s eyes.

“If he dies. If the sound stops for more than ten seconds. If you see... things coming out of the floor. Press Red.”

“What does it do?”

“Total incineration. The cell is flooded with flammable corrosives. Everything inside turns to ash in three seconds.”

“So, that button basically kills him?”

“If we reach that point, Jonas, the priest doesn’t matter anymore. The Red is to seal the room. To ensure nothing comes out.”

Arantes put a hand on my shoulder.

“The shift is 12 hours. Do not sleep. The system monitors your eyes. If you close them for more than five seconds, the chair shocks you. Good luck.”

The first few months were a slow descent into madness. Boredom is the worst kind of torture. You sit there, staring at a dying old man, listening to that sound.

“...Khlerrr-thum-nagh...”

It isn’t a Christian prayer. I was raised in the church. I know Latin. That was older than Latin. It sounded like the language stones would speak if they had mouths.

I started studying Father Thomas. With the camera zoom, I saw details the glass hid. The skin on his knees didn’t exist anymore. The fabric of the cassock, the flesh, and the rug had fused into a mash of dried blood and pus. He was calcified to the floor. That old man couldn’t stand up even if he wanted to.

His hands, clasped in prayer, had nails grown long and curved, piercing the flesh of his own palms.

But the worst was the face. Every now and then, he would turn his head to the side in a spasm. He had no eyes. The sockets were empty, scarred holes. Someone—or he himself—had gouged them out years ago. And the mouth... the lips were open sores from so much friction.

In the fourth week, I found a ""Journal"" on the control room computer. It was a text file hidden in a system folder. Previous monitors left notes.

Monitor Silva (2015): ""He spoke to me today. Not the prayer. He whispered my name. The audio was off, but I read his lips. How does he know my name?""

Monitor Kowalski (2019): ""The shadows in the cell are wrong. The light comes from above, but the priest’s shadow points to the left. And sometimes, the shadow moves when he is still.""

Monitor Helena (2023): ""I dreamed of what is below. It is an ocean. But not of water. Of teeth. Thomas isn’t praying to God. He is singing to put the baby to sleep.""

Helena lasted three months. The log said ""Termination for medical reasons (psychotic break).""

I started doubting my own sanity. The sound of the prayer entered my dreams. I would wake up in my quarters (a concrete room on the same floor) whispering just like the priest. My throat hurt, as if I had been screaming all night.

In the sixth month, the routine was broken.

It was 02:00 AM. I was fighting sleep, drinking cold coffee.

Father Thomas stopped.

The silence in the room was like a gunshot. The audio monitor showed the flatline of silence. I jumped in my chair, hand hovering over the Blue Button.

But before I could press it, he spoke. In Portuguese. With a clear, young voice that shouldn’t have come out of that destroyed throat.

“Jonas.”

I froze. He was facing away, but I knew he was ""looking"" at me with those empty sockets.

“Press the Yellow, Jonas,” the voice said. “I need strength. He is waking up.”

I didn’t think. I pressed the Yellow Button.

I heard the hiss of the automatic injector in the cell. The priest’s body convulsed violently. His back arched at an impossible angle. I heard bones crack. He screamed—a dry, airless scream—and went back to praying.

But now, the rhythm was frantic. Too fast.

“KhlerrrthumnaghSsrrraaatuuhhMmmglllwnah...”

He sounded like a demonic rapper. The frequency rose. The reinforced glass in front of me began to vibrate.

The red phone on my desk rang. I didn’t even know that phone worked. I answered.

“What did you do?” It was Arantes’ voice. He sounded like he was just waking up.

“He asked for it! He stopped! I followed protocol!”

“The seismic activity level just spiked! You injected too much adrenaline! His heart won’t take it!”

I looked at the vital signs monitor. Heart rate: 210 bpm. Blood pressure: 240/150. The priest was going to explode.

“He is rising!” the priest shouted, breaking the prayer again.

This time, he turned. He rotated his torso 180 degrees. His spine snapped, breaking, but he turned. The eyeless face stared at me. He smiled. Black blood ran from his mouth.

“The door, Jonas. The door is creaking.”

And then, the floor of the cell gave way. It wasn’t a hole. The concrete simply became... liquid. The rug where the priest was kneeling sank. I saw Father Thomas’s body being swallowed by the earth. He didn’t scream. He kept praying as he sank into the gray slime bubbling on the floor.

The prayer became muffled, gurgling, until it vanished completely.

The heart monitor beeped. Flatline.

The sound stopped.

“Arantes!” I screamed into the phone. “He’s gone! The floor swallowed him!”

“The Red!” Arantes shouted. “PRESS THE DAMN RED BUTTON NOW!”

I lifted the acrylic cover. I punched the button. I closed my eyes, waiting for the flash of flammable chemicals, the heat, the explosion that would incinerate everything on the other side of the glass.

But... nothing happened.

The button didn’t work.

I opened my eyes. The cell wasn’t on fire. The cell was glowing.

A sickly violet light emanated from the hole in the floor where the priest had sunk. The temperature in my control room began to rise. 30 degrees. 40 degrees. The plastic on the monitors started to melt. The phone in my hand melted, burning my palm. I dropped it.

And then, the Thing began to emerge.

First, it was the fingers. Long, translucent claws, made of something that looked like smoking glass and TV static. They gripped the edge of the hole in the concrete. The size... my God. Each finger was the size of a grown human.

Then, the head. It had no face. A polygon of flesh and light that constantly changed shape. Looking at it made my eyes bleed. I felt hot, red tears running down my face.

The central computer in the room came to life. A text message appeared on the main screen, giant green letters on a black background.

CONTAINMENT SYSTEM FAILED.

OMEGA PROTOCOL INITIATED.

MANDATORY REPLACEMENT.

The doors to my control room locked. Titanium bars slammed down over the exit. A mechanical needle descended from the ceiling, right above my chair. I tried to get up, but the chair had magnetic locks on the wrists and ankles. They snapped shut with a metallic click.

I was trapped.

“No! No! Let me out!” I screamed.

The needle descended and pierced my neck. I felt a cold liquid invade my veins. It wasn’t poison.

It was clarity.

Suddenly, the fear vanished. The pain vanished. My mind expanded.

I understood.

I understood what Father Thomas was doing. He wasn’t praying to a God. He wasn’t asking for salvation. He was telling a story.

The Entity... Whatever that thing coming out of the hole was... is made of chaos. It is pure entropy. It wants to undo the universe, atom by atom. The only thing keeping it trapped is Order. And the purest form of Order is Repetition. Rhythm. The Word.

The ""prayer"" wasn’t magic. It was mathematics. A sequence of frequencies creating a physical barrier against chaos. A wall of solid sound.

But Thomas had stopped. The wall had fallen. Someone needed to raise the wall again.

The Thing in the cell was rising. It already occupied half the space. The concrete walls were cracking, turning to dust. If it touched the ceiling, if it touched the foundation of the church above... the world would end. Not in fire, but in silence. Everything would cease to exist.

I felt the words rising in my throat. I didn’t know them. But they were in the serum the needle injected. Liquid memory. The knowledge of all the monitors, of all the ""priests"" before Thomas.

My mouth opened against my will. My tongue twisted into a painful knot. The sound came out ragged, weak.

The Thing in the cell stopped. The spinning geometry hesitated. It ""looked"" at me through the glass.

I felt a crushing pressure on my brain, like an ocean trying to fit into a water glass.

“SHUT UP, WORM,” the Thing’s voice echoed in my mind. It was pure murderous intent.

But I couldn’t shut up. The drug in my blood wouldn’t let me. The biological imperative was now: Pray or die.

“Khlerrr-thum-nagh...” I spoke louder.

The Thing recoiled an inch. The black slime on the floor bubbled. It hated the sound. The sound was Order. The sound was a cage.

The Thing let out a screech that blew out the remaining monitors in the room. Glass flew everywhere, cutting my face. But I didn’t stop.

The rhythm took me.

My body began to rock, back and forth, mimicking Thomas’s movement. It was the only way to pump the diaphragm to keep my breath.

The Thing began to shrink. The violet light dimmed. It was being pushed back into the hole by the weight of my words. It fought. Claws scratched the reinforced glass, leaving deep gouges right in front of my face.

But I kept going.

It sank. Slowly, inch by inch, the nightmare returned to the earth. The concrete floor, which had been liquid, began to solidify again, sealing the hole.

In ten minutes, the cell was empty. Only the dirty rug and Thomas’s bloodstains remained.

I sat there, panting, trapped in the chair. I waited for the doors to open. I waited for Arantes to come get me out, congratulate me, give me my money.

But the doors didn’t open.

The needle in my neck injected another dose. Nutrients. Water. Stimulants.

The intercom clicked on.

“Excellent work, Jonas,” Arantes voice said. “The transition was smoother than we expected. Thomas took three days to find the rhythm the first time.”

“Get me out of here!” I tried to scream, but the words didn’t come out. My throat was locked in ""prayer"" mode. I could only make the guttural sounds.

“You cannot leave,” Arantes continued, calm. “The frequency must be maintained within line of sight. The glass is the focusing lens. You are the new projector. The audio system was destroyed, Jonas. Now, it is just your voice. Direct into the room’s acoustics.”

The lights in the control room went out. Only a dim light remained on, illuminating the empty cell on the other side of the glass.

And a new button lit up on the panel in front of me. A button that injected water into my mouth through a tube that came out of the headrest.

“The contract was for life, Jonas. You should have read the fine print. 'Monitoring and Containment'. You are the Containment now.”

That was... I don’t know how long ago. There is no clock here.

My knees hurt, even though I’m sitting. I feel like they are trying to fuse to the chair. My eyes burn. I don’t blink anymore. And my voice... my voice isn’t mine anymore. It is a constant hum, an organic machine built to keep the demon sleeping.

Sometimes, when exhaustion hits and I slow the rhythm, I see it. The floor of the cell starts to sweat that black slime. And I hear its voice, from down below, laughing at me.

“Sing, little bird. Sing until your throat tears. I have all the time in the world. And you only have one life.”

My name was Jonas. Now, I am just the sound.

I haven’t been expecting a lot lately from online dating, but wow, the great date I had three weeks ago pales in comparison to the vibes I received today. 

Such great back and forth banter, nice eye contact, and smiles all around! Upon arriving, I received a warm hug, and we got started getting to know each other. The conversation flowed easily, and we were sharing cat pictures and stories like old friends. 

There was no clock watching on this date! The only reason it had to end was because she has difficulty driving in the dark, so we ended up walking to our vehicles that happened to be parked next to each other! We had not one, or two, but three really nice hugs before parting (I requested the third, she obliged!) but no kissing. I’m so happy I can scarcely contain myself!

It wasn’t planned out, but I think it’s auspicious (lucky!) that we met on Festivus! It’s a Festivus Miracle!",1,1766550199.0,OnlineDating,0,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1pue8o4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pue8o4,Cut Off: When Your Parents Fund Your Rival’s Wedding,"At a high school reunion party, I ran into my ex—the guy I'd been with for six years.


""Hey! Sloane, Cassidy and I are getting married next month. You're coming, right?""


I just stood there, stunned.


His family dumped me because I wasn't good enough for them.


But Cassidy? My cousin dropped out in middle school to hang with thugs and dealers.


Her whole family's been mooching off mine for years. Plus, she's got a record.


So WHY marry her?


Seeing my confusion, he explained smugly:


""Easy. She's got money now. Your parents handed her a hundred grand.""


""My parents? A hundred thousand?!""


Now he looked like he was enjoying this way too much.


""Yeah! Your family's old place got bought out last month—some developer paid out six hundred grand. Wait, you seriously didn't know?""


I didn't even say goodbye.


Just grabbed my stuff and called my parents the second I got outside.


They fumbled around, barely getting the words out.


""Oh... yeah, that money. We used it for Cassidy's house and car. It's all gone.""


""Look, she finally found someone! With her history, if we didn't throw everything we had at this wedding, no one would marry her!""


""You're doing great. You're successful. You need to understand.""


Tears started running down my face.


""Oh, I understand now.""


""I don't have parents anymore.""


...


I hung up and blocked their numbers.


When Mom couldn't reach me, she tagged me in the family group chat.


\[Sweetheart, why did you block Mom? Unblock me right now.\]


\[How could you say something like that? Your dad and I are heartbroken.\]


The aunts and uncles piled on, asking what happened.


Maybe my parents felt guilty, because they didn't tell the truth—just brushed it off as ""a little misunderstanding.""


Without a second thought, the relatives took their side and lectured me about morality.


I took a deep breathe and typed my response.


\[Want to know why I blocked you?\]


\[You gave Cassidy every penny from the property buyout—not a cent for me.\]


\[If she matters more than your own daughter, what do you need me for?\]


\[Since we're all family here, let me make this clear:\]


\[I have nothing to do with the Reeves family anymore. I'm not their daughter.\]


\[Let Cassidy take care of you in your old age.\]


With that, I left the group chat and blocked every relative who tried to message me.


Once it was done, everything went quiet.


But inside, I felt hollow—like something had been carved out and the cold air rushed in to fill the space.


I didn't go back to the party. I called a car and went home.


The flickering streetlights felt like they were mocking me.


On the way, my friend Jake called.


""Sloane, you've been in the bathroom forever. When are you coming back?""


""Sorry, I'm not feeling well. I already left—I'm in a car.""


Less than five minutes later, Rhett's name flashed on my screen.


I stared at it and let it ring.


When it cut to voicemail, he called again. And again.


On the seventh call, I finally answered.


""Sloane.""


His voice sounded tired, almost defeated.


""We're over. I need you to move on.""


""Eventually, we're going to be family.""


""Can you please stop acting out because of me?""


So that's what he thought—that I left because of him.


I kept my voice steady.


""It's not about you. I left for other reasons.""


""I barely know Cassidy. You two being together is fine.""


He let out a breath, then tested the waters.


""So... will you come? To the wedding?""


""We'll see.""


I didn't have the energy to deal with him. I hung up.


Chapter 2


When I got home, I collapsed on the couch.


My phone buzzed with a notification.


I opened it. Cassidy had posted something new.


\[House ✅ Car ✅ Engaged ✅ Thanks to Uncle Drew and Aunt Jenna for making it all happen!\]


Three photos: a property deed, a brand-new sports car, and an engagement photo with Rhett.


The comments were full of congratulations.


She must've been too busy with her new car to check the family chat.


So I left a comment:


\[Congrats, Cassidy! Living your best life with my family's buyout money, huh?


Since you took the cash, you can handle Mom and Dad's care from now on.\]


I closed the app, tossed my phone on the couch, and went to take a shower.


Sunday morning, I woke up to a reminder notification—the health checkup I'd scheduled for my parents.


It was set for next week.


They're getting older, and their health isn't great.


Mom has high blood pressure. Dad has a fatty liver.


Even though I live out of state, I take time off every year to bring them in for their checkups.


But now? We're done. It's not my responsibility anymore.


I canceled the appointment and went to make breakfast.


Half an hour later, I was eating my breakfast when an unknown number called.


The second I picked up, Dad's voice exploded through the speaker.


""Sloane Reeves, have you lost your mind?!""


""First you upset your mother, then you post that garbage in the family chat.""


""Then you leave nasty comments on Cassidy's post about making her take care of us!""


""Are you trying to kill us?!""


""Your mother's blood pressure spiked because of you—she's in the hospital right now!""


""Cassidy's getting trashed by all her friends because of what you said!""


""Are you happy now? Tearing this family apart?!""


The barrage of accusations hit me like a truck.


I forced myself to stay calm.


""What did I say that was wrong?""


""You gave Cassidy the entire payout. You didn't think of me at all.""


""So why shouldn't she take care of you?""


Dad sputtered, but kept yelling.


""That property was MINE. The money's mine. I can give it to whoever I want—what's it to you?""


""It's my money. Don't I get to decide what to do with it?""


""Fine!""


I cut him off.


""It's your money. You can do whatever you want with it.""


""But I also get to decide whether or not I take care of you!""


Dad lost it.


""You wouldn't dare! We raised you! You can't just walk away!""


I almost laughed.


""You raised me? How hard was that, exactly?""


""Every piece of clothing, every toy I ever had—it was Cassidy's hand-me-downs.""


""You've always favored her family. Bought her everything new without a second thought.""


""What did you ever buy me? Go ahead, name one thing!""


My voice cracked as years of hurt came pouring out.


""I've been working for three years since I graduated, and I built you that house.""


""Everything in it? I paid for it.""


""Last year when your liver was failing, I didn't hesitate—I gave you part of mine.""


""The year before, when Mom had her stroke, I was there for six months until she recovered.""


""I've poured every dollar I saved into this family, and I never complained.""


""When you got sick, I supported you. I send you most of my paycheck every month.""


""I buy you supplements and designer clothes.""


""I've worn the same three outfits for years. I live in the cheapest apartment in the city.""


""And this is what I get?""


There was silence on the other end.


Chapter 3


Dad's tone softened.


""We know you've been a good daughter. We see that.""


""But you're smart, you've got a degree, a good job—you don't need us. We know you'll be fine.""


""We just thought... the money wouldn't mean much to you. But it could change Cassidy's life.""


""That's what you thought!""


I shouted, tears streaming down my face.


""I gave you everything because you're my parents.""


""I worked myself to the bone to prove I'm just as good as Cassidy.""


""I did it all hoping you'd finally see me.""


""But now I know how stupid I was.""


""Even though she's been to jail, even though she's got no job, you still love her more. You hid the payout from me and gave it all to her.""


""You knew Rhett was my ex, and you never said a word.""


""You treat us so differently, I've literally wondered if I'm even yours.""


""Dad, I'm human. I get hurt. I get disappointed. I have feelings!""


""I even got a DNA test done because I couldn't believe it. I thought maybe the lab screwed up.""


""But now I get it. Some parents just don't love their kids.""


""I've repaid you for raising me. We're even.""


""Let her be your daughter. I'm done!""


I hung up and blocked the number.


All those years of pain finally broke me, and I cried until I had nothing left.


When I calmed down, I opened my banking app.


Balance: $5,000.


Twenty-seven years old. Five years out of college. Five thousand dollars to my name.


I looked around my bare-bones apartment, and it hit me—everything I'd done was a joke.


I used to think that no matter how far I drifted, I always had a home to come back to.


Now I had nothing. I was completely untethered.


I wanted to put down roots.


And a place of my own became the one thing I couldn't stop thinking about.


The next day at work, I compiled all my performance records from the past few years into a spreadsheet and handed it to my boss.


""Sir, I've been with this company for years, and I've never dropped the ball.""


""I've exceeded every target you've given me.""


""I'm good at what I do, and I take my work seriously.""


I paused, my voice tight.


""I'm strapped for cash right now. Do you have any high-commission projects available?""


""I'm not afraid of hard work. I can handle it.""


My boss studied me for a moment, then pulled out a file.


""This one. The commercial development deal for that plot on the east side.""


""We've cycled through three teams already. The client's impossible to please. Total nightmare.""


""But if you pull it off, the bonus will be worth it.""


""I'll take it.""


I grabbed the file without hesitation.


From that day on, I became the last person to leave the office.


I revised the proposal over thirty times. The client nitpicked a dozen rounds.


I saw the city at 3 a.m. more times than I could count. Coffee became my constant companion.


One night, while working late, my phone buzzed.


Jake: \[You left the party early last time. Did you already know Rhett was getting married?\]


I sent back a question mark.


He forwarded me a screenshot—Rhett had posted wedding photos on IG.


Caption: \[Grateful to have you by my side.\]


In the photo, he wore a tuxedo, arm around Cassidy in her wedding dress, grinning.


I barely reacted.


\[Good for him. Congrats.\]


\[Are you serious? You're really over him?\]


\[Yeah.\]

I hated myself.

I’m straight guy, but yesterday was a bit weird. He smiled as he looked at me, with no complaints. He evoked a different feeling for him in me that I cannot quite comprehend. We did chat, and he even took my number, and we parted ways.

Life these days is a humbling mix of kids who roast me daily and somehow still want pancakes the moment I sit down with yummy coffee. Weekends are cozy clothes, a golden floof who treats my socks like enemy combatants, and exactly three peaceful sips of creamy coffee before chaos resumes.

I am totally staying active enough to justify absolutely unhinged Christmas cookie behavior. That involves some running, the occasional workout, and a lot of dramatic yard sprints chasing my floof like I’m training for the Dad Olympics.

Love some tasty coffee (festive, creamy, and quietly judging black-coffee drinkers), suspiciously good at building charcuterie boards I fully snack on mid-assembly, and a fearless cook who follows vibes instead of recipes. My lifelong goal is to hear, “Dad… okay, that actually slaps,” delivered with genuine respect.

Soooo if you’ve made it all the way down here you should say hello!

It’s strategy in the morning, problem-solving by afternoon, and ideas racing your mind even after logging off. Some days you’re celebrating a winning campaign, other days you’re fixing what didn’t work and learning fast. Trends change, algorithms shift, and attention spans get shorter, but that’s what keeps it exciting. 



Being an experienced digital marketer has taught me one thing. Stay curious, stay adaptable, and never stop testing.

1pue2g2,https://www.reddit.com/r/lesbiangang/comments/1pue2g2/men_really_dont_respect_us_and_i_have_zero/,Men really don’t respect us and I have zero patience.,"So I (femme) went on a first date with a girl that’s also a femme. I’ve only dated studs or masc in the past, but the way our date was repeatedly interrupted by different men today was astounding. These men are out here getting bold and I’m struggling to keep my cool.

We were having coffee on the patio of cute cafe that we both wanted to try and it’s obvious that we’re on a date, I even verbalize this in plain language. This dude in his late 30’s pulls up on the sidewalk in front of us on his motorbike trying to show off so we paid him no mind. We thought he left because he drove away but about 10 min later, he’s exiting the cafe and asked if he could join us. 
I told him that my date and I were in the middle of a conversation. He was too fixated on us that he spilled his latte all over the table so we got up and left. 

We then decided we’d go for a stroll around the neighborhood and ended up on this huge walking bridge (we’re still holding hands), but a group of maybe 3-4 men wearing black security uniforms started following us and the whispers started. I tried really hard to block them out. So we stopped and sat on this bench, I saw them disperse and thought that we could finally be uninterrupted. About 5 min later, I noticed one of the men standing near a bench that was across from us pretending to be on his phone. 

I tried so so hard to stay focused on my date because I really enjoyed her company and we were having a good time but I think she was able to tell that I was still flustered underneath it all. Obviously I’m not going to stop seeing her because of this experience and eventually I want to be so unbothered that we don’t have to continuously change venues. We were both looking forward to visiting this cafe and end up having to leave because someone couldn’t show us basic respect.

It’s like if you tell them to leave you alone, they still engage and if you ignore them, they take it as an invitation to approach. They are shameless. I know I shouldn’t be surprised that they were behaving this way but that doesn’t make it any less invasive. Idk what to even do about this but I needed a place to vent.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

The morning had been ordinary. Sunlight filtered through the windows of downtown apartments, streets buzzed with life, and the smell of coffee mingled with exhaust. For most, it was just another day. For Noha, twenty years old and oblivious to what would come, it was the last ordinary morning he would ever know.
Then the sky tore.
It began as a shimmer, a distortion over the horizon. People paused, squinting. Birds fell silent. And then it appeared: a Visitor, enormous and ethereal, hovering above the city like a storm given form. Its surface shifted between metal and shadow, bending the air around it. Cars skidded into each other. Civilians screamed and scattered. Emergency sirens rang out, too little too late. Soldiers mobilized, but their weapons seemed insignificant against the alien colossus.
Buildings shook and splintered. Windows shattered. The street beneath Noha’s feet quaked, throwing him to the ground. Around him, people vanished in bursts of light and distortion. Panic spread like wildfire, but no one could stop it.
From a high-rise observation deck, Dr. Hale watched calmly. Every order he gave over the comms sounded measured, heroic, reasonable. Yet behind the façade, his mind was already plotting. Every deployment, every tactical command, subtly nudged humanity toward a path only he and a few others understood. Humanity had survived this first encounter, but survival would become a far darker burden than they could imagine.
The Visitor withdrew by nightfall, leaving the city in ruins. Fires burned unchecked. Smoke choked the streets. Noha, trembling and covered in dust, stared at the devastation, knowing that life as it had been was gone forever.

Something you should know about the story

Visitors= alien colossus 
AEGIS = organization that fight Visitors
SOLACE = organization that funds AEGIS [high authority of world]
DEFENDERS =AEGIS soldiers and workers


Time Skip – Present


Decades later, the surface of Earth had become a grave. Humanity clung to life underground, in vast cities carved into the crust, beneath layers of reinforced steel and concrete. The sun was a memory; the sky, a myth. The surface was forbidden, a dangerous place for ghosts of a world that had died slowly over years of fighting.
Noha sat in AEGIS headquarters, the glow of tactical monitors washing over his face. His fingers hovered over the coordination panel, guiding squads, marking safe zones, logging casualties. He was not a soldier, not on the frontlines, but the weight of the battlefield pressed on him nonetheless. Each screen told a story of destruction: collapsed tunnels, incinerated squads, civilians trapped and lost. He memorized their names, because memory was all he had left of the living.
Another Visitor had appeared, massive and shifting, bending gravity and light. Squads deployed; many did not return. Noha’s eyes moved over the displays, calculating, coordinating, helpless. Each victory seemed hollow. Each defeat, a tragedy. And still, the battles came, relentless as the decay of the world itself.

After humanity moved underground, AEGIS began studying the distortions left behind by the Visitors—areas where sound bent and machines failed, as if the planet itself had been wounded. Dr. Hale called it resonance: a shared frequency between the Visitors and Earth.
Project LUCENT was approved to study it. Officially, the goal was simple—capture a Visitor, extract its core structure, and build a system capable of controlling or neutralizing them. SOLACE provided the funding, calling it a final hope for survival.
Deep beneath the city, a captured Visitor was suspended in containment. Its presence unsettled everyone nearby. Hale ignored the reports and focused on the data. When human neural signals synchronized with the creature’s frequency, the readings stabilized instead of collapsing.
From that discovery, the Resonance Core was created.
On paper, it was a weapon. In truth, Hale understood what it really did—it aligned all living signals into a single, quiet rhythm. No pain. No resistance. Just an ending that felt like rest.
He shared only what AEGIS needed to hear.
The rest of the truth waited.
And when Hale noticed that one young operator, Noha, could stand near the Core without flinching, he marked him quietly.
Some endings, after all, required a steady hand.

Over the following weeks, the underground city became a symphony of war. Sector 12 was engulfed in chaos as a Visitor ripped through the tunnels. Armor clanged against impossible force, yet it shattered. Soldiers fell mid-stride. Sector 7 saw evacuation squads ambushed; screams echoed through hollow conduits as civilians were lost. Sector 3’s tunnels collapsed entirely, trapping dozens beneath tons of concrete.
Noha moved like a ghost among the monitors, guiding what he could, witnessing everything he could not prevent. The names of the fallen haunted him, etched into memory like scars on his mind. Each loss deepened the gnawing realization: survival had become a form of cruelty.


Meanwhile, in the hidden chambers of power, SOLACE convened. The group of elites — scientists, philosophers, politicians — had long since realized that humanity’s continued survival was not mercy, but suffering. Dr. Hale, their secret ally within AEGIS, began manipulating the defenders with careful precision. He issued orders to capture a Visitor under the guise of weaponization, emphasizing safety protocols while hiding the true purpose of the mission.
For years, he guided humanity’s defenders toward a plan they could not comprehend. Every lie, every manipulation, was calculated to bring them closer to the inevitable end. Only the Core remained, waiting for someone with the authority to act — someone like Noha.
The signs were subtle at first. Visitors that were captured behaved curiously, observing rather than attacking. Protocols made little tactical sense. Dr. Hale’s private communications contained hints of a far-reaching plan. Slowly, as the battles continued and the casualties mounted, Noha began to piece it together.
The truth was chilling: the Visitors were not weapons. The Resonance Core was not a tool of war. It was a device to end humanity peacefully. SOLACE had decided that survival was cruelty, and Dr. Hale had agreed in secret, ensuring that the defenders remained unaware of their true purpose.
Noha’s heart sank as he realized the weight of what had been orchestrated, and the only question left was: who would give consent to activate it?
The Final Choice
The last Visitor had been captured. The Resonance Core glowed softly in the central chamber, awaiting the human touch that would decide the fate of all life. Outside, battles raged. Soldiers fell mid-strike, tunnels collapsed, and screams echoed in the dim underground corridors.
Noha approached the Core. He thought of the friends he had lost, of soldiers and civilians alike, of cities broken and lives ended. The screens reflected faces he would never forget. The full scope of humanity’s suffering pressed down on him.
He pressed the panel.
Time froze. The Visitors halted mid-motion, suspended in a quiet grace. Pain vanished. Fear dissolved. Suffering ceased. Life folded gently into silence.
Epilogue
Noha remained, the last conscious witness. The underground tunnels were still, the monitors dark. Humanity’s end had come, not with fire or chaos, but with mercy. And in that moment, Noha understood the truth of it all: sometimes, the greatest act of courage is choosing to let go.
The war was over. The world was over. And Noha, a boy who had watched from behind monitors, had chosen the final mercy for all.",1,1766548858.0,story,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

1pudvt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pudvt3/ive_been_stuck_driving_on_the_same_road_that_i/,I’ve been stuck driving on the same road that I died on for the last three years,"I truly believe that some of the most bone chilling stories are the ones that have never been told. If you think about it, those that are able to recollect and tell their stories are the reason folklore exists at all. The dead are limited in their ability to transcribe the series of events that led them to where they rest today. I think that in itself is a terrifying aspect of the unknown. Without the knowledge passed on by those braver than you, you’re just as blind as they were, while they were still alive.

I died a good while back, on the highway while heading back home. For the last three or so years, I’ve been stuck in this place that isn’t heaven or hell. Maybe it’s purgatory? I’m not entirely sure. All I know is that I’ve been stuck driving on the same road that I died on for the last three years. While I can step out of my Ute and walk around, there’s not really a point, as my surroundings are dark and desolate. If everything wasn’t illuminated by either my headlights or the faint, otherworldly hue, then I would be faced with unimaginable darkness. 

It’s not entirely empty either, driving along I see things ranging from crashed vehicles, my own Ute and body nearly unrecognisably mangled in the middle of the road, or roadkill that walks and hops despite broken bones and huge chunks of flesh missing from their bodies. While I do see the occasional human being, I try my best to avoid them. I find that newcomers are the most prone to violent bouts of aggression as they go through the five stages of grief in here. I’ve only ever let one other person into my vehicle in the last three years, and it’s a mistake that I will never make again.  

It all started as I was heading home late one night. Looking back on it, I should’ve just pulled over and slept, or napped, or anything. But overconfidence pushed me to drive seven hours home, despite not having slept in the last two days. I had multiple coffees and energy drinks, and stopped occasionally to piss and splash my face with cold water, but I was still feeling myself slipping the whole way. My ego wouldn’t let me sleep on the side of the road due to how uncivilised it seemed, and my fear wouldn’t let me as I imagined teens, thieves or worse catching me while I slept. Now, not only do I sleep in my Ute in the infinite blackness of the void, I hear things outside scratching and tapping at my doors and windows, eager to come inside.

I was about two thirds of the way home when I closed my eyes far longer than I should have. Though it was night while I was heading home, when I awoke I could immediately tell that something wasn’t right. It’s the same feeling you get when you’re lucid dreaming, that awareness that everything around you isn’t real as you float listlessly in your thoughts. 

I stepped out of my Ute with the headlights still on as I gathered myself. I felt… fuzzy, sort of when your limbs that fell asleep start receiving circulation again, and the pins and needles fade away. It was that feeling, but constant, across my entire body. I felt cold, but I couldn’t really feel my surroundings. I think that’s when it really dawned on me. I couldn’t hear anything or feel anything around me, sure I could hear my heartbeat and pinch my skin, but everything else was just… numb…

I saw my decimated vehicle in the middle of the road, looking like crumbled up wrapping paper. It remember my first time seeing it vividly, because it essentially just behind my Ute, as the faint red glow of my rear lights revealed it in an ominous glow. I didn’t need to get too close to see my body torn in half, splayed over the bonnet and steering wheel like a doll. My bones protruded out of my arms, legs and torso, while my head looked partially caved in. 

From the way it looked, I have to think that I swerved into a truck coming in the opposite lane. My hypothesis was based on how my Ute went from looking like a terrier to a pug, with a noticeable amount of damage present to the frame that couldn’t be the result of a hatchback or a sedan collision. Though in all honesty, I haven’t no idea what exactly happened. Just that I hit some cunts’ vehicle, and that I died while he survived. 

Something that I realised quickly was that my truck didn’t require fuel. Not only that, as long as I kept it on the road and avoided hitting the living roadkill and other hazards, my Ute can keep going forever. I didn’t need food, but anything I found that I could eat comforted me, despite not feeling hungry or full afterwards.

One thing I realised on the second or third person I ran into was that you should never, under any circumstances, attempt to make a U-turn and drive back the way you came. You should and can only drive forward. If you realised you’ve left something behind, just get over it, because you’re not getting it back. While I was still new, I met this Asian fella looking at his own body that had propelled itself from his windshield to about five metres away from his car. His suit ripped in tatters as a trail of blood and flesh bits followed a metre or two back, I could grimly imagine m what the front of his body looked like as it was grated against the rough, tar road. 

“Where- Where am I?” He blurted, It was easy to tell that English wasn’t his first language, so I spoke as calmly, coherently and slowly as possible.

“I’m sorry mate, but you’re dead” I said bluntly.

No- No… Can’t be…” he looked around, both at his original wrecked car and the one he had parked on the opposite side of the highway. 

“Where is she?… Where…?” He asked, as he approached me with his wallet opened, inside was a picture of himself and what I assumed to be his daughter, no older than six or seven. 

“She must be alive still, I’d consider yourself lucky.” I replied, at this point, he started speaking either Chinese or Vietnamese (I couldn’t really tell) and got back in his car. I saw him make a u-bolt and head the opposite way. I watched as he drove out to where I could only faintly see his headlights, before seeing the faint silhouette of his car falling as though it was pushed off a cliff. For a brief second, I swore I could see his headlights shine from under the ground as he spiralled and spun before melting into the void. 

I can’t imagine what happens if you manage to die here too. Maybe it’s complete void like a dreamless sleep, or maybe you do end up in heaven or hell and this is just an awkward pit stop to the great beyond. I haven’t the faintest clue what awaits me, maybe it’s better than this place, maybe it’s worse? My greatest fear is that beyond this, there is simply nothing at all. I try not to think about that while I’m driving, but the thought comes and goes as easily as the bloody kangaroos that litter the highway. 

At this point, you may be thinking to yourself how exactly am I posting these if I’m dead? To be completely honest. I have no idea if these are going to reach anybody really. My phone still works and the battery doesn’t drop no matter how long I can use it. I can’t seem to get into YouTube or Spotify though which is a shame, since there’s this podcast I really like listening to when I was driving to and from home. I can post things on websites but when I check homepages or anything, my phone freaks the fuck out and I have to shut it down and start it up again to make it work. The first time I did that, I was shitting myself thinking I lost the ability to look at my kid’s texts. But after it turned on again, I realised it was fine and everything was still on it.

Driving becomes its own hell when you can’t listen to anything. I’d take listening to shitty radio stations than nothing at all. The silence just leaves you with your thoughts, or it highlights a rattle you didn’t think was there before so now you can’t stop hearing it. Before realising that my existence depends on looking at the road, I would check my phone while driving, scrolling through old messages, trying to send messages only to encounter an error, or listen to videos I had saved on my camera roll. 

Another thing you gotta do is to always keep your eyes on the road. Always. Because there is some strange shit in here that isn’t animal or human. I was looking through pictures I took of a cruise with my now ex-wife as I caught something from the corner of my eye. At first I thought I was seeing an impossibly large wombat, but its hair was dark and smooth looking, almost glistening like it was wet. Of course my first instinct was to stay on my phone and drive around it. As even if I did manage to hit it, I’ve hit the living roadkill in here before and they just get right back up after going under my tires. But as soon as I looked back down at my phone, in the middle of the cruise picture I was looking at, I saw that thing, and it looked like it was getting closer.  My eyes fell back onto the road, where I saw it looking directly at me, it’s eyes indescribably bright as I quickly swerved around it, it’s eyes now burned into mine as I felt it’s bold gaze linger in front of me for a few minutes before dissipating. Something about its eyes and the way it looked at me felt eerily familiar, I near about had a panic attack afterwards as my memory of the thing seemed to deteriorate after passing it. I see it now glaring at me from outside my window in the dark fields on my left. So unless I want more glaring at me, I’ll do my best and keep my eyes on the road. 

I’ve yet to find a bottle-o here, though if I’m lucky I’ll find strangers with slabs full of beer. This year I saw a guy in a small hatchback parked on the side of the road. Now usually I’m very wary of others, both in life and… wherever this was. But at that point, I hadn’t spoken to anyone for weeks, and I wasn’t feeling great after dealing with the last person I met in here. I didn’t care though, and parked up a bit behind them and greeted them. I approached a young man, curly hair, couldn’t be older than twenty-five. I’m sure my forty-year-old ass was intimidating as I saw him back away when I greeted him. 

 

“Hey mate, you new here?” He looked me up and down, as his hand felt behind him for his door handle.

“Sorry to bother ya, I just want to talk-“ he kept grabbing at the handle, unable to get it open. He turned away from me and began furiously pulling at the door handle. If he wasn’t built like a twig, I would’ve rooted for him pulling the door off its hinges. Instead he gave up and ended up running into the darkness. I called out to him, as there was no way I’m going out into that abyss with no vehicle or light. 

“It’s your funeral mate, I just wanted to talk! Don’t let the ghouls get ya!” 

I chortled, sometimes I get so bored I amuse myself. I peered into his small, black hatchback. He was lucky that cars don’t really break down here, cause his black shit-box barely passed as a paddock-basher. It was old, very old, with stained seats and a whole lot of trash on the floor. Hidden in the backseat, I could see a slab of beer partially covered in a blue tarp. I checked each door, before realising he locked himself out of his car. I couldn’t help but feel bad for the guy, so I decided to help him out. I think the slab is more than adequate payment. I don’t know if I imagined being drunk or if the alcohol actually had an affect on me, but that was the best day I had in weeks.

This old road extends beyond reality itself. Sometimes the memories of what once was leaks into this place, dotting the sides of this barren highway. These memories take the forms of locations; old gas stations, small homes; all of them seem to find their way here eventually. That’s where I manage to grab my food and beer from. I fondly remember finding the servo I used to visit as a kid on the side of the highway. I parked my Ute near the rusted pumps and headed inside. The place was almost exactly how I remembered it, with a barrel of lollipops near the registers, bottles of energy drink and cold coffee in the dark fridges and the slushy machine right next to the warmers full of meat pies and sausage rolls.

Sadly, the place was rather dilapidated. Not completely run down mine you, best I can describe it is when a store hasn’t been cleaned in a day, and you’re the last one there as everyone else has gone home. There wasn’t any power, but the otherworldly hue from the ground illuminated the place just enough for me to make out my surroundings. There was plenty of snacks and canned drinks ripe for the taking. Though just as I was stuffing my pockets and hands with as much as I could carry, I heard something else enter the building. I looked up at the dirty safety mirror in the top corner, as I saw a large, shadowy figure enter. It moved unnaturally, struggling on horse like legs. It was frail, moving with great weight, dripping dark ichor onto the ground below it. It looked up and faced the mirror, looking at me with those bright, ineffable eyes. The thing was following me, and I saw no reason in sticking around. I managed to sneak over the counter and quietly went out the employee fire exit before booking it to my Ute. I started it up and left, seeing the thing looking at me in my rear view mirror. I made sure to carry my hunting knife with me each time I explored from then on. 

 

That- whatever it is, isn’t the only thing that creeps me out. Though they are hard to see, you can occasionally spot concealed driveways and dirt roads leading to gates branching off the main highway. I was still relatively new when I first came across one of them, now I try my best not to look at them as I pass them by. Back then, my curiosity got the best of me, and I got out to look at where it lead to. The dirt road lead to a metre tall gate, with rusted barbed wire and poles stretching endlessly into the darkness. On the gate, was a large, wooden sign painted in red and black that simply read…

 

THE BEND

 

I took a squiz just past the gate, and saw the edge of the world. A few metres past the gate lead to a sheer drop that sunk into nothingness. As I was standing out there, I swore I could faintly hear whispers in the darkness. Though when I looked around, nothing was there. At least, nothing I could see anyways. I think I checked two other side roads after that one, those roads went a bit further than my light could reveal, but I got a real bad feeling from them. The last one I saw looked exactly like the gate outside the home of an old friend of mine. He died about ten years back in a car accident. I don’t like checking them anymore. 

 

I drove for a while with the first person I met here. He went by Shane, and he seemed pretty experienced. He was a bit skinner, wearing a blue flannel and a dark Stetson hat. If everything he said was true, then he is the only man I know who has survived the longest in here. His Ute was filled with rifles, chains, hunting knives and a few first aid kits. Funnily enough, my first meeting with the cunt was having his gun pointed at my head. Being the scared newcomer I was, I let him do whatever he wanted. After searching my Ute from top to bottom, he went to his Ute to grab something. The hand that once carried the gun that was pressed against my temple now had a cold beer in it.

 

“Sorry mate, I had to check for any Yowies” He said gruffly. I was nervous at first, but I took the offering and cracked it open. I remember asking a whole lot of useless questions, like “what is this place?”, “why are we here?”, shit like that. 

“What do you mean Yowies?” I finally asked, to which he gave a wide, toothless grin. 

“They’re the things that wander around ‘ere. I reckon you’ll find one soon enough. Big, dark things that ooze…” He pulled the sleeve on his right hand, showing a missing index finger that once connected to a black stub. He mumbled quietly. 

“Ooze that’s cold and wet, but it burns… it sucks, and it burns… Dream like things, lost spirits that have lost themselves in this place…” 

I wasn’t sure how much of his ramblings were of real events, or half-imagined ones. I just knew not to belittle the man who could blow a clean hole through my brains. Though it wasn’t stated outright, I felt obligated to follow Shane. That and he made me drive before him, whether it was so it was easier to shoot me, or if it was for my vehicle to protect his for whatever was out there, I’m still unsure of. He forced me into old houses that manifested on the side of the highway. Each time he asked me-

“Do these look familiar to you?”

Each time he did, I said no. 

All of the houses seemed foreign to me. Some were brick, others were timber, all of them old fashioned. They had a late sixties, vintage style, accompanied by classic cars outside. They looked as if someone picked up a house in the middle of the country and dropped them right next to the highway. Shane would push me inside, gun poking my back, as he made me scout them out. I checked them room by room, giving updates and giving him anything I managed to find as he waited outside. 

Each of those homes were falling apart, wallpaper peeling off like sunburnt skin and mould sprawled across the ceiling and walls. I was hoping that there’d be a weapon I could use to defend myself, though the most I could find were old kitchen knives and potato mashers. Still, I held onto the hope that I would be free of Shane at some point, but those first few weeks were tough. As he had some quirks that made him a cunt to be around.

Besides his eagerness to apply violence to yield morbid gains, he was extremely opinionated and had an extremely short fuse. He kept going on to how all the good jobs were being outsourced, despite the fact that we’re both dead now. I usually just nodded and pretend to agree with most of what he said. The only good thing about having him around was that it made the time go by quicker, but time holds no meaning here so I’m not sure how much worth that has anymore.

He told me a little about how he ended up here, not that I had a choice in the matter. When someone has your life in their hands and ask you “Do you wanna hear a story?”, the safest thing to say is yes. Best case scenario he just keeps yapping and ignores your input. He was a hunter that would sneak into large properties to hunt game, primarily deer and boars in the dead of night. He had caught a sow and three piglets, he had them chained in the back of his Ute and driving along the highway when he caught on to police lights from his rear. He sped up trying to evade them before eventually being caught. The police cruiser parked right in front of him, giving him enough time to “give the bastard what he deserved”. In what I can only assume was a fit of blind rage, he had shot the cop right where he stood, and realising the consequences of his actions, got back into his Ute and started speeding home. He didn’t even make it a kilometre down the M1 when a kangaroo jumped out and collided with him, sending him down into a creek where he drowned. Hearing that story explained why his Ute always seemed damp and smelled the way it did.

I think I put up with him for about three weeks before something significant happened. We were searching inside this house together, and this time he came in with me as opposed to just waiting outside like he usually did. I just figured he was bored and wanted a change of scenery, but something about how he was looking around the place and moved through it’s withered halls made me think that it was something more significant to him.  

I was going down this dark hallway, as he was the only one allowed to hold one of his many flashlights when I heard him make this loud, almost feminine shriek. I turned around and watched this huge, dark creature grab a hold of him from under an old bed. Its arm was huge but thin, with stringent muscle connecting to its shrivelled forearm. He had dropped his gun and flashlight as he was crawling and gouging at the timber floorboards underneath him. His nails ripping out of his hands, sticking out of the floorboards as his screams filled those hallowed halls.

“Fucking help me John, you useless cunt!” he screamed and whined. He looked at me with this desperation that almost made me consider saving him. I immediately reached for the gun and torch. Seeing as I still had the opportunity, I raised the worn rifle up, aimed, and fired into Shane’s side. He coughed up blood as he glared at me, pain and anger pooling in his dark eyes as he was pulled under the bed. I let that thing keep his body as I ran to my Ute and drove off, laughing the whole way like ol’ bloody Saint Nick. I was reborn, moulted by newfound freedom, my head throbbing as the adrenaline wore off.

I remember the feeling of liberation I had when I was finally free of him. But until then I was fearful, not just because he had a gun pointed at me most of the time, but by the thought of what waited for me beyond this place. I think that was the catalyst for my intrigue into the *after*\-after life. I reflected a lot after dealing with Shane, if he taught me anything, it was that in this place you only have two options. You either pass on to whatever awaits us beyond, or you keep going, trying to find meaning on this long, dark road that never ends.

I thought I found meaning in Julie. I came across this younger lady, who was the first women I had seen in here, and I spotted her crying on the side of the road in front of her blue sedan. She looked like she was in her mid-thirties, with silky dark hair and these bright brown eyes. I had gotten out of my car to greet her, as she ran up to me and gripped onto my flannel.

“What is this place?! Where’s my husband?! Where’s my son..!” She spoke between sobs as she beat her fists against my chest. I looked over at the car wreck sprawled across the road. The debris scattered farther than my headlights could show. If you didn’t come here with the same car you died in, I wouldn’t have had the faintest idea of what type of car she was driving. It was so badly mangled and compact that it looked like it was used in those test trials, where they smash cars against a wall at hundreds of kilometres an hour. I stood there rather awkwardly looking back at it. As history can attest to, I was not the best at consoling women in distress. I just let her get her feelings out, before she looked up at me with wet, red eyes.

“I’m sorry ma’am, but you’ve passed on. If your husband and child aren’t here, than I can only assume that they are still alive.” I said as compassionately as I could manage. I didn’t have the heart to tell her what condition they must have been in. I’ve seen people wheelchair bound after car accidents, and one who laid in a coma until their family pulled the plug on them after half a decade. I’m not sure what it waits for those who pass outside this road, but I can only imagine how her spouse and son had survived such a mess.

I gave her a rundown of everything I knew inside her sedan, what my theories were (still banking on this being some sort of purgatory), what ghouls I have seen roaming around, I mentioned the story of the guy doing a u-bolt but didn’t tell her about Shane, as I didn’t want to scare her with the threat that man still posed in this place.

“That’s all I know so far, I wish you the best, I may not see you again when I leave and-“

“Wait!” she blurted out, before her voice dropped to a whisper. “Please… Can I ride with you?”

I sat in my Ute and boiled over on the idea. I wasn’t sure how big of a risk it was bringing someone else, maybe that thing that killed Shane was only there because we were both in the house at the same time? There were too many unknowns and what-ifs to make a rational decision. At the time I had to consider that after each stranger I passed, I never saw them on the road again. Would it be so bad to have some better company on the road?

“Sure” I stated. “Just stay behind me. If I go before you, then it gives you a chance to escape if something happens to me…” She hugged me after I said that, and for a second, I considered hugging her back. The temptation was strong, but I settled with a firm pat on the back. Maybe I’ll talk more about her, once I have more beer.

I’m not sure if anyone will see this, but writing all this down has helped out a lot. Plus, it’s a breath of fresh air as opposed to driving endlessly on the road. Until then I plan on driving and hopefully finding another slab. If I pray, then hopefully I can manifest a drive through bottle-o and grab enough grog to forget everything. Maybe the key to leaving this place is to get absolutely smashed. That’s the dream anyways. I’ll write more down if I feel like it.",1,1766548750.0,nosleep,0,0.67,False
1pudvj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OT42/comments/1pudvj6/reese_talks_about_her_stepbrothers_suicide_and/,Reese talks about her stepbrother's suicide and asks fans to donate in his name,"Reese Quibell starts her stream showing some gifts her mom gave her and complaining that her mom keeps giving her Spongelles, which are buffers infused with body wash. When a chatter suggests Reese could give some of them to H's girlfriend, Reese says H doesn't have a girlfriend anymore and that he told her his girlfriend cheated on him. That is not the kind of information Reese should be sharing on the Internet. Reese calls that girl a floozy.   
  
Reese says getting cancer is her biggest health-related fear and that if she were diagnosed with it, she would hope it would take her quickly so she wouldn't suffer for years like her stepdad has. She says she wanted to hop on her channel tonight because she's going to be taking a few days off. She claims she's going to be spending some time with H and then H is going on a trip with her mom and stepdad.   
  
Reese and her chat start suggesting phrases that they can use to insult or confuse people they don't like. ""There are assholes everywhere,"" Reese says. She's pushing her fans to use the phrase ""Hashtag Olive Branch"" because of a reel that she saw.   
  
She starts talking about her critics again. ""I love it when the trolls come in,"" she tells her chat. She claims there's nothing that she's hiding, which is a lie. It's a documented fact that her on-again off-again boyfriend Tommy is a convicted sex offender. She blatantly lied about that last night.   
  
Reese says she'd love to get a job in customer service and wait until a customer flips out so she can flip out on them herself and then get fired. She has talked about that before and says she'd like to stream it.

A chatter says Reese handled the Aaron and Jenna drama well, but Reese claims she didn't do content about it. That's not true. She spent most of a stream talking about it on Dec. 7, the same night that Aaron and Jenna did their explosive videos about their breakup. Reese said she was planning to take the day off but she decided that she would stream because everybody knew what was going on with Aaron and Jenna. Reese gaslights her audience when she tries to deny content that they have seen with their own eyes.   
  
Reese says her channel is small because she doesn't do drama streams. She says Aaron and Jenna's public breakup is a bummer ""and I would never do content on that.""   
  
She says she'll be back on Relatable Reese on Christmas Eve ""and believe it or not, I have therapy tomorrow.""   
  
Reese spent the afternoon with her mom and stepdad and says she was shocked to get permission to share that her stepdad asked her to promote a charity and ask Relatable Reese fans to give money in memory of her stepbrother who killed himself. Reese claims she has never talked about that before, which is another lie. She has even shown a photo of a memorial that her stepdad built on his ranch in honor of that son. Her stepdad was a pilot in the Navy and this son was also a pilot. Reese says her stepbrother took his own life at age 26.   
  
She says he struggled throughout his teens ""and my stepdad had him in around-the-clock therapy. ... At some points he was in hospitals for months at a time. ... His name was Lee Boyd Walker."" These are details I haven't heard her share before. She holds up a folder for Daystar Counseling Ministries, a Christian nonprofit in Nashville. Reese's stepdad has established the Lee Boyd Walker Fund there. ""These people really, really helped him and they knew him very well,"" she says.  
  
I don't think Reese ever even met Lee because in the past she has said that when she was first getting to know her stepdad, he opened up to her about a son that he had lost and how he could see that Reese was struggling.   
  
Reese says that Daystar ""is a really great foundation as far as I know. I don't know a lot about it."" She asks her mods to put the link to Daystar's website in the chat and says her stepdad asked that her fans donate in his son's name. She fills out an online donation form and tells Daystar officials that Lee is her stepbrother. Reese donates $15. ""He took his life on Easter so Easter is always really tough for me every year ... because of my stepdad,"" she says.   
  
Several fans say they are donating in honor of Lee and a Zoom caller who also mentors Reese about Christianity says she donated $100 in Lee's name. ""My dad will be blown away by that,"" she says. ""Thank you, thank you. ... You guys don't have to do it. I was just beside myself today when I was sitting with him in the living room."" It looks like Reese has tears in her eyes and she sounds choked up. That older Zoom caller has spent a large amount of money on Reese since finding her channel. She often superchats Reese, she travels to see her and she buys her gifts, including a costly cross necklace that Reese sadfished for on a shopping livestream.   
  
Reese says Rocky Kanaka is an animal rescuer that a lot of fans have told her they love. ""You buy his coffee and can you guys confirm for me that the coffee money goes toward the animals that he's got?"" she asks her audience. Chatters say yes. Reese looks online. ""I need to buy K cups,"" she says. ""... It's $24 for 10 pods. OK, that's a lot but it is organic. ... Geez, shipping is 9 bucks. I hate paying for shipping."" She pays $32.98 for 10 K-cups. ""I'm assuming it's a good cause,"" she says.

Around New Year's, Reese will be in Ecuador ""and I will stream while I'm there,"" she says.   
  
Tomorrow she wants her channel to donate to Samaritan's Purse, an evangelical Christian charity founded by Franklin Graham, a key supporter of Donald Trump. Many of Reese's fans were traumatized and afraid when Trump was elected, but Reese is asking them to support a charity led by one of his main allies and apologists.   
  
""Charity is really, really important to me. It's never mattered to me before,"" she says, adding that she has helped some charities in the past and that she took food and other supplies to some animal shelters when she lived in Kansas City. She tells a fan not to worry that they can't afford to donate to charity along with other other fans. ""It's like superchats. No one is ever forced to do anything with their money,"" she says.   
  
""I've given quite a bit of money in the past seven to 10 days that we've done this,"" she says. ""Tomorrow will be the last day of doing it. ... I want to thank you guys for getting on board with this."" Since starting this charity effort, Reese has donated $175 in addition to the $32.98 she spent on coffee tonight that will benefit Rocky Kanaka's animal rescue efforts.   
  
Giving $190 to charity this holiday season isn't much compared to the amount of money Reese has spent recently on clothes and jewelry she doesn't need while claiming she needs to save money.   
  
She reiterates that she's going to be spending a few days with H and then he's going on a trip with her mom and stepdad while she goes to Ecuador. Reese says a couple is going to stay at her house to watch her pets.   
  
She thanks some fans for sending her Christmas gifts and claims she doesn't have a way to send a thank-you to one of them so Reese gives her a quick thank-you on camera.

1pudvda,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pudvda/did_i_get_ghosted_because_i_did_not_sleep_with_him/,Did I get ghosted because I did not sleep with him?,"Hello everyone, I (21f) had a first date with a guy (27M). 

We met up in a restaurant to have some desserts and coffee, he actually lives 20 mins by car from the city center and 15 mins from my house. First he suggested that I come over and he cooks for me, I explained him that I do not go to people’s houses randomly. He respected it and we decided to go for desserts. He asked me if he should pick me up, I said no because I do not get into random cars without seeing the person in real first. Anyways, date time comes up and he texted me saying that he is already in the restaurant. For me it was a bit weird because ALWAYS we meet up in restaurant doors or around and then we go in together. 

I get into the restaurant, he gives me a hug, but If I am being honest it was lowkey weird. Then we sat and talked for 2 hours straight. Honestly I enjoyed my time with him while we were talking. He told me that since he lives alone now he is feeling alone and needs companionship. Which is pretty understandable. He also complemented my looks few times. Considering he is dutch, I will choose to believe that he already meant it, since dutch men are known for directness.Also, during this time he was a bit touchy. He touched my arm and hands. Then we went for a walk after, during this time as well, he was a bit touchy and one time even grabbed my hips. 

However, since weather was cold, we did not want to walk a lot so he asked me what we should do later, I told him that I would better go home because I always try to keep first dates short. 

He dropped me off with his car, even almost to my house, I told him that I had a good time and we will speak later, he said “definitely”. 

He texted me when he reached home and told me had a good time. ( even added 😉 sticker lmao)

However he did not text me today at all, is he ghosting me because I did not sleep with him? I am getting so much mixed signals :/ ",2,1766548712.0,dating_advice,5,0.75,False
1pudumt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1pudumt/nyc_for_fresh_start_crazy/,NYC for fresh start? Crazy?,"I (33m) have been in Portland, OR for the last 12 years and am desperately trying to figure out what to do next with my life. 

I’m somewhat alone in this city as most of my immediate family lives at least 3.5 hours away by car, some further. I have had an amazing friend group while in PDX but over the last few years it’s dwindled down and grown apart (some had kids, some moved away, life happened, etc) which has led to me feeling pretty out of place in my current stage of life. It’s draining on my mental health.

I’ve met my now GF (30f) 1.5 years ago and she has suggested wanting to move back to NYC next summer for a few years before settling down somewhere for good.

I thrive with big city activities. Big fan of live music, coffee shops, good food, broadway and other live performances, sporting events, etc. Her whole family lives right outside of NYC and many of her friends are still in the area so may help with a new social circle. I would very much miss my family but my current job lets me work remotely for weeks at a time if I wanted to visit.

I current work fully remote in tech making ~200k TC. My gf makes ~125k in health care and could get a job pretty easily if we moved there. I own my home with a 2.75 interest rate and would profit ~$600/mo in rental income (plus the 1k+ principal pay down). She currently owns a 2b1ba apartment in Manhattan where our monthly payment would be $3500 per month that she’s been renting out while traveling for work. Downsizing from my current home would likely help with my day-to-day stress. I don’t care for PDX at all and being a solo homeowner has drained me (bought with an ex but now own myself). Honestly, if it wasn’t for that previous long term relationship, I may have moved long ago.

My job would let me work anywhere in the US. Could eventually get a new job if I wanted to help with the COL increase (easier in NYC anyways and likely more stable long term if I planed to stay in the area).

Am I crazy for considering this “fresh start”?

1pudq7y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pudq7y,"7 Years Asleep, 7 Weeks Awake: BYE Felicia, HELLO NEW ME!","I was twenty-five when I jumped in front of a car to save Wesley Thornton.


The impact left me in a coma for seven straight years.


Wesley worked himself into the ground to keep me alive—twenty thousand dollars a day, every single day, just so I could keep breathing in that ICU.


When I finally opened my eyes, the world had forgotten me.


Terrified, I waited for Wesley to come take me home.


He walked in with lines around his eyes I didn't recognize and another woman's hand wrapped in his.


Then he got down on his knees beside my wheelchair and begged me to let him go.


......


Everything was wrong when I woke up.


Strange faces hovering over me. Machines I didn't recognize. Seven years gone like nothing, and I couldn't stop shaking, couldn't catch my breath.


""Wesley..."" His name barely made it past my lips. ""Wesley, please...""


My nurse grabbed my hand and squeezed.


""Sweetie, I've never seen a man so head-over-heels for someone in my entire career.""


""The other nurses told me about the night they brought you in. You were covered in blood, barely hanging on. Your boyfriend was holding you, just—completely destroyed. Crying so hard he couldn't even stand.""


""He swore—right there in the ER—that he'd do whatever it took. And he meant it. Seven years. Twenty grand a day. Never missed one payment.""


""God, at first he came every single day. He'd wash you himself, talk to you for hours.""


""He's busier now, I know, but he still makes me text him your picture every night before I leave.""


Something about her words dulled the sharp edges of my panic.


Made the horror of seeing myself in the mirror—muscles wasted away, skin mapped with scars—hurt just a little less.


Wesley showed up two weeks after I woke up.


Taller than I remembered. Shoulders broader.


The softness in his face had been carved away into something harder, sharper, unreachable.


His hand hesitated before brushing tears off my cheek.


""Hey."" His voice was hoarse. ""You're back.""


They told me everything after that.


How he'd drunk himself into a bleeding ulcer trying to close deals for my medical bills.


How he'd flown to Germany, to Japan, to anywhere that might have answers.


How he'd gotten on his knees begging specialists and researchers to take my case.


So I pushed myself.


Harder than the doctors wanted.


Gritted my teeth through rehab sessions that left me shaking and sick.


Bit down on my tongue until I tasted blood just to keep from screaming.


I hated how slow I was. How broken. How useless.


Then one afternoon my doctor burst into the room and tore into Wesley.


""What the hell is wrong with you?! You're going to destroy what's left of her!""


Wesley just stood there in his suit, face completely blank.


When I reached for him, he jerked away like I'd burned him.


And then he just—snapped.


""Madeline! Do you—do you have any idea what you've cost me?!""


His voice cracked, raw and vicious.


""Two hundred million dollars! I couldn't—I couldn't sleep for weeks, couldn't eat, couldn't think about anything but you dying, and now you're awake and you're—you're already—""


He pressed his palms against his eyes, shoulders heaving.


""My entire life doesn't revolve around you! Every single time—why is it always—why can't you just—""


""You're disabled now. You get that? You can't just do whatever the hell you want anymore!""


His eyes were red and wet and filled with something I didn't recognize.


I tried to touch him again.


He yanked his hand back.


So I smiled. This desperate, pleading thing that made my face hurt.


""I'm sorry. I didn't mean—I'm so sorry—""


After that, Wesley came to every session.


Sat in the corner. Didn't speak. Didn't smile.


Just stared through me.


I didn't know how to reach him anymore.


Didn't know how to bridge seven years of distance.


Once—back when we were happy—I'd scrunch up my face when I was upset and he'd crack up laughing, pull me close, kiss my forehead.


So I tried. Made that same stupid expression.


He looked at me like I'd lost my mind.


""You're thirty-two, Madeline."" His voice was flat. ""Act like it.""


Then he left.


The days bled together after that.


His hands on my arms during physical therapy.


His face always turned away. His silence filling every room like smoke.


Until the afternoon he glanced out the window and froze.


There was a girl standing outside in the rain.


Young. Beautiful. Tears streaming down her face as she stared at us through the glass.


She looked like me. Before.


Wesley instantly dropped my arms and bolted—slammed his shoulder into the doorframe hard, didn't even slow down.


He didn't see me crumple behind him. Didn't hear the sound of my body hitting the tile.


I crawled to the wall on my hands and knees, shaking badly, and dragged myself upright.


And finally understood.


Why he couldn't look at me anymore. Why every conversation felt like he was choking. Why he was drowning and I was the anchor pulling him under.


I smiled.


Waking up was supposed to be the miracle.


Turns out it was just the beginning of another nightmare.


Chapter 2


Wesley didn't come back until past midnight, reeking of perfume I didn't recognize.


I turned to face the wall and shut my eyes.


The mattress dipped as he dropped onto the edge of my bed, like all the fight had gone out of him.


""I ended it.""


Silence stretched between us like a wire pulled too tight.


When he spoke again, his voice broke in half.


""But Madeline—I hate you. I hate that you saved me.""


Business makes enemies. That's just how it works.


Wesley climbed too fast, stepped on too many throats.


Someone decided he needed to die for it.


When that car came screaming toward him, I didn't think.


Just shoved him as hard as I could.


""Seven years. I sat there every night watching you waste away and no one—no one told me when it would end. What I was supposed to do.""


""You couldn't even—you lost control of everything. I cleaned you up. Every single time.""


""I waited and you never woke up and some nights I thought maybe we should both just—just end it.""


His breathing went ragged.


""I wished it was me in that bed. Every day.""


""Then I finally started to feel human again. Met someone who could laugh, who could actually be there, not just—not just lie there like she was already dead.""


""So why now? Why the hell did you have to wake up now?""


I bit down hard, trying not to make a sound.


Turned out waking up wasn't his miracle.


It was his nightmare.


He bent forward, shoulders shaking.


""Why can't you just—why can't I just be happy for once?""


""Haven't I—haven't I done enough? What more do you want? What more can I possibly—""


He choked on the words, pressed his palms against his face.


My chest felt like someone had carved it out with a rusty spoon.


Just empty. Scraped clean.


The next morning he acted like nothing happened.


Took my hand on autopilot. ""Sorry about yesterday.""


I stared at the purple shadows under his eyes. I hadn't slept either.


Pulled my hand back gently, kept my voice bright. ""Go if you need to. I'll be okay.""


""I was alone for two weeks. I survived.""


At that, he frowned at once.


Then he grabbed violently me from behind, fingers digging in so hard I gasped.


""What's that supposed to mean? You blaming me now?""


""You don't get to blame me!""


By the end he was screaming, completely unhinged.


His grip left bruises. My eyes burned but I smiled anyway. ""No, I just—""


""I really will be fine alone.""


He took a deep breath. Let go slowly, face going blank.


When he spoke again, his voice was flat. Dead.


""Stop. Just stop.""


""You can't even walk without falling over. What exactly do you think you're gonna do?""


""It's not like I have a life outside of this. Everything I do is for you.""


The question slipped out before I could swallow it back. ""Do you still want to marry me?""


He froze.


Long, awful silence.


Finally he sighed, staring at the floor.


""Yeah. When you're better.""


Before the accident, we'd already booked the venue.


Argued over centerpieces and first dance songs.


Back then we were getting married because we wanted to.


Now Wesley just kept saying it like a mantra.


Like if he repeated it enough times it might become true.


""We were supposed to be married already.""


""Marrying you... it's the right thing to do.""


Chapter 3


The second time I saw Chloe, she showed up at the hospital looking for me.


She said they got together four years after my accident.


Wesley had been barely functional back then.


She pushed her way in, all warmth and light.


Little by little, she pulled him out of it.


They went everywhere together.


The photos kept multiplying—holding hands, kissing, wrapped up in each other.


He actually looked happy in those pictures.


""He loves me. I'm the one who kept him alive while you were basically dead.""


Turned out the two weeks after I woke up?


They'd been celebrating her twenty-fifth birthday.


""The second he heard you were awake, it was like someone dragged him back underwater. He went dead inside all over again.""


""He's only here out of guilt. Please—I'm begging you—let him go.""


Before I could say anything, she cried out and dropped to the floor.


I looked up. Wesley was standing across the room.


He shoved past me so hard my wheelchair slammed into the wall.


Pain shot through my spine.


He was on his knees beside her instantly, checking her over with gentle hands.


Then he turned to me. His voice cut like glass.


""I said I'd marry you, Madeline. What else do you want?""


He'd forgotten I could barely stand on my own, let alone push anyone.


...


Discharge day. Wesley carried me to the car without a word.


He drove in silence, thumb scrolling through photos of her.


I'd gone through his phone once.


The lock screen was still my birthday—that had made me cry.


But he'd muted the nurse's messages. Nearly a thousand texts he'd never opened.


I sat there staring at his phone, laughing and crying at the same time.


My lover wasn't mine anymore. And I had no one to blame but time.


Then his ringtone shattered the silence—her special one. His whole face changed.


""Mr. Thornton—we were helping Miss Anderson move like you asked—""


A sharp intake of breath. ""She took pills. We're at the ER.""


Every bit of composure Wesley had been clinging to shattered.


The car screeched to a halt.


He was out the door before I could blink, leaving me on the curb without my wheelchair.


His taillights disappeared around the corner.


Hours passed. The moon rose. No one came back.


So I started walking.


No phone. No money. Just me and the cane, every step uneven and excruciating.


eople saw me and looked away.


""Don't. What if she tries to scam you?""


The rain started around dusk.


I kept going until I found the house—our house.


His car was already there. He had an umbrella over Chloe, her head resting on his shoulder.


He saw me and something flickered in his eyes.


Then he looked away and walked her inside.


My legs were about to give out when he finally came back and helped me into the chair.


The house was hers now.


Matching coffee mugs. Stuffed animals everywhere. Their bathrobes hanging side by side.


Wesley moved through the living room unpacking the boxes she'd started, putting everything back in its place.


He brought her medicine. Dried her hair. Tucked her into bed and kissed her forehead like she might break.


I sat by the door dripping rainwater onto the hardwood.


When he closed the bedroom door, he finally looked at me.


He walked over and knelt in front of my wheelchair.


""Madeline, I'm sorry. But this has to end.""


""I lost you when you were twenty-five. She's twenty-five now. I can't lose her too.""


""I'll take care of you until you're better. Give you whatever you need.""


His eyes were bloodshot. ""Please. Just let me go.""


I reached for him—


Everything went black.


I never got to answer him.


The last time he knelt like that, he'd been holding a ring.


""You're the only one I'll ever love, Madeline.""


Turns out I was the only one who never moved on.


Seven years. And I was still waiting.

So, I’ve been talking online with a really cool woman. We share a ton of interests, we’re the same age (34), she lives in my city, and she seems genuinely kind and sweet. The issue is that for the past six years I’ve been dealing with this dog agoraphobia. Sometimes it’s better, sometimes it’s worse.

I’m fine moving around my own neighborhood, or anywhere within a 10–15 minute walk. After the holidays, though, we really should meet if this is going to go anywhere. I’m wondering whether I should be upfront about my situation (I'm actually planning to fix my situation once and for all with the help of SSRIs - I want to go back to University in September) and ask if she’d be open to meeting near my place. There are plenty of nice spots around here where we could grab a coffee.

I’ve also been thinking about whether I should try experimenting with benzos, though I’m not sure that’s the right approach. Realistically, in 2-3 weeks I could probably manage going farther, maybe 5–6 tram stops closer to downtown but it wouldn’t be very comfortable.

On top of all that, I haven’t been on a date since 2021, so yeah… that adds another layer to it.",1,1766548240.0,Agoraphobia,3,1.0,False

When I first started playing, I always saved up for the 3000 pack because it’s supposed to have the highest chances of giving you a new Phobie. However, a friend of mine never saved up because she was too lazy to do so, so she always bought the 1000 packs, and I noticed that she was constantly getting new Phobies.
That made me curious, so I decided to try it myself. During all the months I spent opening 3000 packs, I barely got any new Phobies, but in the few months I’ve been opening 1000 packs, I’ve been getting new ones very often. It’s pretty strange.

THE WALKING DEAD

Season Zero

**EPISODE 1: LONG ROAD AHEAD**





A sunny morning in Macon, Georgia. The sun is shining, the birds are chirping, how better can this day get? It doesn’t get better at all. It gets **WORSE**. JESSE, a man in his late 30s, is sitting at the dining room table, in his robe, drinking a cup of coffee and shaking a newspaper. Then, his wife MIRANDA comes in touting a dufflebag. She has a lab coat on as well.  
  
**JESSE**: Morning, honey.  
  
JESSE looks at the dufflebag  
  
**JESSE**: They… got you coming back in again?  
  
Miranda sets down her dufflebag, adjusting her cuffs  
  
**MIRANDA**: Yep. Ever since flu season started, we’ve been getting a lot of patients. The hospital is basically packed. That, and with how under-staffed we are, it’s hard to keep up.  
  
**JESSE:** What do you mean… under-staffed?  
  
**MIRANDA:** Apparently, this flu is so bad that over 75% of the staff is on medical leave. It’s really just been me, Jenny and Nathan running things, at least in my wing.  
  
JESSE looks away and drinks his coffee. He ruffles his newspaper  
  
**JESSE:** Huh. Newspaper says people have begun protesting in the streets.  
  
MIRANDA reaches in her purse and pulls out a thermos. She takes a sip before putting it back  
  
**MIRANDA:** Where does it end?  
  
Suddenly, you hear JUNIOR from his room  
  
**JUNIOR:** Mom… Dad? Did Mom leave yet?  
  
MIRANDA yells from downstairs “Nope. I’m still here, sweetie”. Without missing a beat, JUNIOR zooms downstairs  
  
**JESSE:** Well, look who’s up. How’d ya sleep, kiddo?  
  
**JUNIOR:** Good, I guess. I didn’t really sleep because I was praying that everyone at school would be okay.



**MIRANDA:** They will be. This flu will blow over.



MIRANDA leans in and kisses JUNIOR on the forehead. She then looks down at her watch  
  
**MIRANDA:** Oh, darn. It’s time for me to go  
  
MIRANDA leans in and kisses JESSE on the lips before grabbing her dufflebag. Her left cuff is up her forearm, which reveals a bite  
  
**JESSE:** Uhm… what’s that?  
  
JESSE points to the bite. MIRANDA looks  
  
**MIRANDA:** Oh, that. Yeah, we had a crazy guy come in to the hospital the last night. The cop I spoke with thought he might be an escapee from the psychiatric facility. Anyway, it took the cop and two hospital security guards to get him restrained. Bit me in the process.  
  
**JESSE:** Promise me you’ll get that looked at.  
  
**MIRANDA:** \*sighs\* I promise. I’ll have Jenny and Nathan look at it first thing when I get there.



JESSE nods  
  
**JESSE:** Alright.



**MIRANDA:** Anyways, I gotta go.  
  
MIRANDA ruffles JUNIOR’s hair, then JESSE’s, and caresses his cheek before walking out the door and shutting it.  
  
**JESSE:** So, what’cha wanna do, kiddo? School’s out because of the flu.  
  
**JUNIOR**: Can we have some hash browns for breakfast? With a side of eggs.  
  
**JESSE:** Heh. Anything for you, kid.  
  
JESSE goes in the living room and turns on the TV before going to dig in the freezer.  
  
  


**TV:** Breaking news in Macon today as Lee Everett was arrested. Mr. Everett, the UGA professor, called in sick today and came home to what appeared to be an affair. His wife, who was supposedly sleeping with the state senator, Richard Sharp, was killed brutally by Everett. UGA students described Everett as a stand up guy. A man who would help anyone, even give them the shirt off his back and would smile doing it. We have no idea what caused Everett’s violent outburst. Everett is looking at 9 years behind bars and won’t see light until 2009. More on the story as it develops.



JESSE flicks off the TV  
  
**JUNIOR:** Dad… why did that man do that?  
  
JESSE kneels next to Junior  
  
**JESSE:** Because… he… was hurt. And when people are hurting, they have nothing to lose in that moment. His wife cheated on him, and that’s the worst kind of hurt. A hurt that can make you do things you regret later.  
  
JUNIOR hugs JESSE  
  
**JUNIOR:** Dad?  
  
**JESSE:** Junior?  
  
**JUNIOR:** Promise me that you and Mom will never be like that.  
  
**JESSE:** Junior… me and your mom… we love each other very much. We would never do that to you. Now, how about those hash browns?  
  
**JUNIOR**: Yeah. I’d like that.  
  
The camera pans to a photo on the table next to the front door. The photo is of a young girl, 3-4 years old.

Today, issue number six went out to over 3,000 subscribers...

…and one of our subreddit users let me highlight their awesome snow pic.  

u/CinaminLips took a killer snow pic.  Look for Issue #6 on the site.  Oola bowl on me CinaminLips or Chellas?… your call!

So I decided to do something cool and partnered with 8 local businesses and will be giving away almost $2,000 in Lancaster LOCAL prizes as a celebration & thank you.

The Lancaster Loop is fairly straightforward...

One email, once a week, all the good of Lancaster City and County.

Things to do. 

Places to eat. 

People and businesses worth knowing.

Always local. Always free.

No crime, no politics.

The Loop is my way of celebrating a community that's welcomed me and my family over the past two years...and a fun way to help us all feel a little more connected to where we work and live…and eventually do some IRL events.

I'll try to curb my enthusiasm, but it'd be pretty neat if you decided to join me in what I'm building and subscribe…for free... 

lancloop.com/subscribe

You'll immediately receive a welcome email and then every Tuesday at 7:17 am (see what I did there) an email newsletter will arrive in your inbox.

If you decide to join, the giveaway starts this Friday 12/26 so pretty quick turnaround, but def worth it to win an Oola bowl & Oola t-shirt!

Easiest way to enter is check out the IG page for a chance to win stuff.  Or read Issue #6.

You can win a brand new $500 TaylorMade driver, gift cards to Tanger Outlets, Airbnb prop in  Lanc City, YourLife Gym credit, Nikki’s Custard merch, and a ton of other fun stuff.

Excited to meet more people around Lancaster & celebrate all the talent here.

I’m a 32 year old guy living in San Diego looking for a female chat buddy who enjoys easy conversation, friendly banter, and getting to know someone beyond small talk. I have been in SD for about a year now and I love it here. It would be awesome to meet fellow San Diegans, but if you are from somewhere else that is totally fine too.

A few things about me:

I am the kind of person who loves learning how things work and I enjoy talking to people who are curious about the world.

Outside of work, I am usually gaming, taking photos, or hanging out with my two cats. I go fishing when I can, I catch shows around the city, and I am always searching for a new coffee spot to try. I drink my coffee black most days, but once fall hits I am absolutely ordering something pumpkin flavored.

I am a big movie person. I am into anything from Pixar, Nolan, Spielberg, Anderson, Hitchcock, Kubrick, or Tarantino (and of course I love Finding Nemo). When it comes to TV, I bounce between sci fi, dumb reality shows, classic cartoons, and adult cartoons. Think Firefly, Westworld, The Expanse, Looney Tunes, Rick and Morty, South Park, Smiling Friends.

I like plants, I drive a stick shift, and I enjoy a good steak dinner. Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday and there is no chance of convincing me otherwise.

If you are thinking about messaging me, here are a few easy ways to start the conversation:

• Tell me about your favorite band or show

• Tell me your go-to coffee order

• Tell me something small that made your day better

He’s introverted, really sweet, and friendly with everyone. He had to drop me off late that night, and after I made a joke about coffee shops not being open 24/7, he offered to make me coffee at his place. I didn’t think much of it and said yes.

We were both still dressed up from the event, and I wasn’t very covered. I assumed he was going to sit across from me on a chair. He’s always very respectful + not touchy, so him sitting next to me on the couch caught me off guard. We talked for over an hour facing each other and brushed knees at times.

Nothing happened, but I felt a lot of tension and was pretty nervous, avoiding eye contact most of the time. I eventually apologized for staying so late because I felt like I was intruding. I’m a very awkward person which leads to me avoiding any kind of interaction with men.

The next day I dropped something off at his place and brought extra cookies I had, but he barely looked at me and made a slightly awkward, pointed comment - “did you happen to just have these cookies?” The day after that, we met again in a group and though he seemed mostly normal, he declined lunch with a vague reason.

Now I’m worried I’ve caught feelings and may have made things awkward.  I can’t stop wondering if that night changed things.",13,1766546919.0,bodylanguage,8,0.84,False

1pud7h7,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1pud7h7/pelvic_floor_urinary_and_prostate_problems/,"Pelvic Floor, urinary, and prostate problems","So I started bupropion about a year or so ago. Around that same time I started to notice that I was having trouble peeing. I would go and nothing would really come out. Then I’d have to go back about ten minutes later. It was getting embarrassing at work. 

I went to my PCP and they tested me for a uti. Nothing showed up. I had an ultrasound and some other tests to no avail. They wanted to put me on cipro but I refused because they couldn’t find an infection and I’ve heard bad things about cipro, so she sent me to a urologist. 

The urologist said he thinks I have pelvic floor dysfunction. So I go to pelvic floor therapy, they give me a list of stretches and exercises to do for 10 weeks. My symptoms got better but quickly came back. I started the pelvic floor exercises again and made it through the ten weeks but was still having issues. 

I went back to my urologist and he tested me for a uti and checked to see if I still had urine in my bladder after using the restroom, and he said I did not. He then prescribed me tadalafil saying it would help the smooth muscle and should help with the issues. 

Throughout this entire year I would creep on this sub and finally it clicked that bupropion was likely causing the issues so at the same time I started tadalafil I stopped drinking any and all caffeine. My symptoms went away immediately. I don’t think it is the tadalafil, but I’ve kept taking it for…other reasons. But I have tested the caffeine theory and without fail if I have any caffeine at all my symptoms will come back. So I’ve switched to pretty much just water. I even tried decaf coffee and even that seemed to cause issues if I drank more than one cup. 

So things have been great since I found this out but today, after drinking decaf coffee, I was using the bathroom. I still have to “milk” the rest of the urine out, unfortunately, but today whenever I did, semen/prostate fluid came out. Has this happened to anyone else!? It happened earlier in the year and I assumed it was pelvic floor related which made me start the exercises the second time, but everything had been great now. But it’s been happening all day. 

tl;dr: if you have urinary retention problems, try getting rid of caffeine, it helped me immediately. Also, has anyone had spermatorrhea (leaking semen) when peeing? ",2,1766546627.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

☕ Shop Now and Save! English Breakfast Tea delivers that perfect morning kick you've been craving. www.coffeeduke.com. Also available on Amazon. 

Some mornings demand more than just caffeine. They need tradition. Comfort. A cup that wraps you in warmth while gently nudging you awake.

English Breakfast Tea isn't just another tea blend: it's a morning ritual that's been perfecting itself for over a century.

# The Robust Flavor That Started It All

Bold. Full-bodied. Unapologetically strong.

English Breakfast Tea brings serious flavor to your cup. This isn't delicate afternoon sipping territory. We're talking about a tea with backbone.

The blend typically combines:  
• Ceylon black tea for brightness  
• Assam for malty richness  
• Kenyan tea for depth  
• Earl Grey's distant cousin with zero bergamot interference

Premium Quality Matters

Coffee Duke's English Breakfast comes freshly blended using only premium tea leaves. No dust. No fillers. Just pure, robust black tea that steeps into liquid gold.

The result? A cup with complex layers: nutty undertones, subtle sweetness, and that satisfying astringency that makes your taste buds pay attention.

# Morning Fuel Without the Coffee Crash

🚀 Perfect Morning Energy Boost Available Now!

Caffeine Content: 30-50mg per cup

English Breakfast sits in the sweet spot between herbal tea's gentle nudge and coffee's aggressive wake-up call. You get sustained energy without the jitters.

The L-Theanine Advantage

This amino acid works magic with caffeine. Instead of a sharp spike followed by a crash, you get:  
• Calm alertness  
• Sustained focus  
• Smooth energy release  
• No afternoon crash

Morning Routine Perfection

Start your day right:

1. Steep for 3-5 minutes
2. Add milk and sugar if desired
3. Pair with breakfast or enjoy solo
4. Feel alert without feeling wired

# Versatility That Works Every Time

Plain or Fancy: Your Choice

English Breakfast plays well with others:

Classic Preparation:  
• Strong black tea  
• Splash of milk  
• Sugar or honey to taste  
• Traditional British style

Modern Variations:  
• Iced English Breakfast for summer  
• Add lemon for brightness  
• Honey instead of sugar  
• Plant-based milk alternatives

Any Time Pick-Me-Up

Morning person? Perfect morning starter.  
Afternoon slump? Ideal energy refresher.  
Evening wind-down? Skip this one: save it for tomorrow's wake-up call.

# Health Benefits That Actually Matter

• Polyphenols support heart health

# More Than Just Morning Tea

Office Essential  
Keep English Breakfast at your desk for afternoon focus sessions. Better than energy drinks. Cleaner than coffee crashes.

Social Ritual  
Share a pot with friends or family. English Breakfast creates conversation, not caffeine competition.

Travel Companion  
Hotel coffee disappointing? Pack English Breakfast tea bags for reliable morning fuel anywhere.

Meal Pairing  
• Full English breakfast (obviously)  
• Toast and jam  
• Scones and pastries  
• Light lunch foods  
• NOT with delicate flavors that get overwhelmed

# The Timeless Appeal

Why This Tea Never Goes Out of Style

Some things improve with time. Others perfect themselves early and stay consistent.

English Breakfast Tea falls into that second category. It solved the morning beverage equation decades ago:

Strong enough to wake you up + Smooth enough to enjoy + Flexible enough for personal preferences + Reliable enough for daily consumption = Perfect morning tea.

Cultural Connection  
This isn't just tea: it's participating in a global tradition. Millions of people worldwide start their day with English Breakfast. You're joining something bigger than your morning routine.

Economic Sense  
Premium tea costs less per cup than coffee shop visits. Better flavor than generic grocery store brands. Coffee Duke delivers both quality and value.

Heck even a few hundred views is good enough for now. I've slowly been getting subscribers, at 26 now, and I've always felt that if I just keep at it things will slowly get better.

But suddenly my last 3 videos have essentially no distribution! < 10 views, limited views that are all basically from me and subscribers. The analytics say it's showing a few of the <10 views for each video came from the shorts feed, but I'm not sure I really believe that, if it was actually showing it to people the analytics suggest they should be doing far better... I don't get why they are being killed. The retention is >100% for each of the recent videos that are being killed with 100% staying to watch.

I feel like the account is in some kind of limbo... any idea why? Or how to break the spell? No copyright issues... no warnings... nothing at all sketchy going on on my end.

I’m (30M) a guy that never got into a relationship or even anything stable. Lots of mixed things: shy, a bit antisocial (nothing serious I mean, just don’t like to party night or drink and so on, I prefer chill plans like coffee, a walk, cinema…), a bit closeted and so on.

For about 3 years now I have been stressed out about job things, and neglected lots of things on my life, including social, like all I do now is work, sleep, eat and repeat, I don’t have really friends or meaningful relationships outside work and family.

So recently I got into the idea of downloading Grindr to search for connections, open minded, just chat a bit, know someone interesting, maybe friends and even boyfriend? I’m not interested in any case in the “just sex, now” with random people I see Grindr is mostly used for here.

After some 2 weeks of nothing, I started to chat with what seems to be a very nice guy (33M), I said to him how I’m nervous because this is my first time meeting people out of apps like this and was very comforting, seems intelligent, IDK, seemed great. And he wants to meet to take a coffee and know each other and see what happens, no pressure.

BUT, I’m worried because IDK if I should go forward.

For starters, he’s handsome and fit while I’m a bit overweight (about 220lbs), so I’m worried I’ll not be his type and make things weird if I don’t like him. Like why bother, he’s not my league I think.

Also, he’s very social, like participating constantly in group activities with lots of people (ie, long hitchhiking routings every month with +20 people), going out…, and even suggested me I would be welcome to accompany him as he would love to have someone with him in those activities. I don’t see myself into that, both physically (yet) and mentally (integrating myself in activities with so many unknown people, for hours…), I don’t have that battery in me and never had it.

Just to end, he’s very sweet, like he lost his family young, but he’s gonna go to celebrate Christmas with an “adopted grandma” to accompany her and help her celebrate. And that makes me feel good about him. But we don’t have (I feel) nothing that has made “click” or spark in our chats. He’s a very arts and social guy while I’m a shy reserved engineer/science guy. We still didn’t have anything meaningful chat I fear, just talking about every day topics like when you take the elevator and talk with a neighbour.

So summing it, I’m worried we don’t have anything to share and be like “we have this in common”

Given all the context, I’m thinking it should be for the better stop our plans and meeting to avoid giving hopes to him and me, and wasting his time, so it would be better to turn a page and keep looking or just accept finding someone isn’t easy.

What would you do?

“The Quiet Won’t Hold”

Good evening, shadow on the wall,

You and I have met through every fall.

I come to bed, I kill the light,

But peace don’t ever make it through the night.

The room is still, the house is deep,

Yet something in me won’t keep sleep—

A low-born spark under my skin,

That turns “lie down” into “begin.”

I fold the covers, try to pray,

Try to bargain time away.

I count my breathing, slow and thin,

But the storm keeps marching from within.

The mattress feels like heated stone,

The sheets a net around my bones.

I close my eyes, I clench my teeth—

And every minute steals my breath.

And the quiet won’t hold,

No, the quiet won’t hold.

I rise again without a sound,

Barefoot circles, up and down.

Hallway miles at 2 A.M.

Like moving’s my only prayer again.

I lean on doorframes, try to stand

Like stillness is a thing I can command.

But the moment that I stop to rest,

It starts again—no peace, no rest.

Morning comes with pale, cruel light,

As if I ever owned the night.

Folks ask, “You alright?” I smile too fast,

Say, “Long week,” like that’ll earn me a pass. 

Coffee shakes inside my hand,

I’m living tired I can’t understand.

I sit for work, I stand for air,

I vanish from my own chair.

And the quiet won’t hold,

No, the quiet won’t hold.

Some nights I press my palms and plead,

“Just let me drift—just let me breathe.”

But mercy’s always out of reach,

And rest is something others teach.

So I pace my prayers into the floor,

Wearing down the same two boards.

If sleep’s a country, I can’t go—

I’m at the border, pacing slow.

Good evening, shadow on the wall…

You and I have met through every fall.

And the quiet won’t hold—

No, the quiet won’t hold.",2,1766546344.0,RestlessLegs,1,1.0,False

So this morning she texted me before work saying ""merry xmas eve!"" Super nice, but I notice she didn't or doesn't really use any relationship language. As in no x or no baby or no I miss you etc. Anyway, 

I text her saying I wish we could cuddle. She replies a couple more times then I say 

""A cuddle/sleep in then a gentle wonder to get a coffee!! The best combo""

""I love cuddling you darling!"" (trying to connect wrmly and romantically with the distance. 

""Have a good last day!!!!"" 

I stacked all this messages. Then she replies hours later ""Thanks <3"" 

Now, my main thing is that I send her warm and cute texts you know? I try to make an effort to let her know I am thinking of her and that I miss her etc. But sometimes I just don't get the warmth back like her ""thanks"" 

Maybe she is just that secure and comfortable and safe? Like its all good! or is there an energy imbalance?

Monuments and library. They’re often very curvy and have very earthy and radiant features. An easy vibe and an easy attraction one that feels right and yet one that makes you crave them and their touch-an aphrodisiac(May be in the modeling scene or the screen kids/ acting is a possibility but might not be the end game/gluttonous spouses and sensual partnerships)

•moon and sun ruled people and or people with a lot of Leo and cancer tend to have striking features that give them a natural feminine(moon) or masculine(sun) look to them. They can be very bright and overwhelming yet above and expressive. They often look very youthful and vivacious and have tender and supple features.a very openly alluring energy one that makes you crave them insatiably without even knowing it-they’re desires bouncing off you like a end game tennis match(may attract caregivers/lime light and fame/success rooted in the energy given to others-dramatic love affairs and lovers who would give it all)

•mercury ruled and Virgo or Gemini people are usually lean and or fragile looking-fast moving ligaments and body parts and often live the fast moving city life-and the occasional mountain climbers and wildlife enthusiast. They have very mischievous looking features and look very young no matter their age. They can have bubbly smiles and no matter their size it can be hard for them to hold on to weight! Even if Taurus is present they may fluctuate weight wise often-yet find it easy to get back in shape. Their features are very delicate and in a sense perfectly suited for them-as if they were hand crafted.(morning jogs and all nighters at work-often the ones drinking coffee and on the move!/performers and the lyrical rappers! Dancers and wild life activist! Running for exercise and studying. Lovers here are usually either talkative or super attentive and the type to listen rather then speak-caring and reliable.)

•Jupiter or Neptune ruled and or Pisces and Sagittarius heavily influenced! Can be very translucent in how they look! Can have pale skin and may have cold bodies! Very timeless looks and seem to have looks from another era and often times from another life. Very nomadic type of bodies and can seem very loose and elusive to the touch. Delicate skin like Gemini and Virgo but may have very fleshy and organic looking features! Not heavily applied looks often don’t use much makeup or much work into grooming beards or body. Wavy and natural looking hair and a beauty that leaves much in mystery and a magnetic undercurrent of promise and release(art shows and galas/late night cruises and falling asleep on the park bench/deja vu and portraits-old Polaroid cameras and dangerous nights at the club-hallucinogens and “don’t”-lovers are confusing and demanding; they drain you and rejuvenate you all in one a very odd and deep welled buzz but one with its trials and tribulations)

•mars and Pluto ruled and or Scorpio and Aries heavily aspected. A intense and passionate Flore-they look like the night and feel like the galaxy burning above you in a theater play format. They have a very athletic and almost sexual look about their bodies even if they have the most baby like of faces. They have an unmistakable look in their eyes that is disarming to even the most powerful of men and the most willful of women. They also have a natural low glow about their skin almost like a sort of tan and an olive like radiance. There skin is of the oily variety which adds to the gleam they have. They’re hair is often wild or curly in its consistency and they usually have some sort of roughness to them be it their faces or body-they have scars and often carry a bit of bruises. They are magnetic and frightening and aren’t for those weak of heart-they radiate a fatalistic type of energy and one that often compels many in their wake.( these are the models without humor-the serious ones/the skaters and the ones alone at the party/the quiet night outs with friends and the walks down Manhattan-lovers are often intense and alluring, they have a force about them and often times can be transformative)

•Saturn and Uranus or a lot of Capricorn and Aquarius. Tend to have tall and or middle ground heights. Serious faces and aloof demeanors-systematic movements but also extremely mental and body compatibility in their movements(almost as if they’re bodies are so in sync with their mind) beautiful smiles and cheeky yet dry humor. Easy going but detached-caring yet distanced. Structured bodies and very angular features. The bones are often well framed but also tend to be the most fragile spot on the individual. They have a very cool yet icy magnetism one that leaves you craving their validation and their attention a swoon so deep you won’t even know you’ve been caught up. (Often the most seen in the modeling scene! Late nights at the office and brief cases/fancy dinners and Coachella/ Italy and Germany and Japan-south Korea come to mind here-lovers are serious and have a ambitious nature to them. Can struggle with intimacy and may be extremely loyal and dedicated to the partnership.)

Some basic information about me: 
I'm not diabetic, but my baseline is between 100-110, but I should have very good insulin sensitivity based on my after meal data, I did test insulin once and c-peptide once separately, they were both normal (in the middle of the given range), so according to my research I'm physiologically (not pathological) insulin resistance which is a healthy state, and my high baseline can be caused by my long term low to no carb diet. I'm wearing a CGM to find out if I have insulin resistance (prediabtic) due to the high morning glucose levels. 

So as I mentioned I'm mostly on a low carb diet, cheated 2 times during the 3 weeks of wearing it just to see what would happen, so a big low carb meal would increase my blood sugar by no more than 20mg/dL (most of the time it's less than 10 if not close to 0), and a really high meal would increase 40mg/dL. 

But a latte or even a black tea with cream in the morning would spike blood sugar by 30, if I drink it within an hour, it'd just climb up non stop for an hour. I know this is not super new, but I'm wondering why caffeine even in black tea can cause as much a big spike as a carb meal. 

I wonder if anyone here: 
1. Has the same high baseline blood sugar especially if you wear a CGM? 
2. Does the coffee and tea part sound weird to you, and is this reported often here in this subreddit? 
3. If coffee even tea spikes my BS that profoundly, am I stop drinking anything in the morning that contains caffeine?

1puck99,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingHub/comments/1puck99/framework_the_5_blocks_nobody_talks_about/,Framework: The 5 Blocks Nobody Talks About,"You sit down to write. The page is blank. Your mind is blank.

You've tried everything:

* Changed your environment
* Adjusted your schedule
* Read other writers for inspiration
* Taken walks
* Made coffee
* Dimmed the lights

Nothing worked.

So you googled ""overcome writer's block"" and found 50 articles saying the same thing: *""Just write and don't wait for inspiration.""*

You tried. It didn't help.

Here's why: **You're probably using the wrong strategy for your specific block.**

# Writer's Block Isn't One Problem

Most advice treats writer's block as a single issue with one solution.

It's not.

Writer's block is actually multiple different problems masquerading as the same thing. Each one requires a different strategy.

# Some ""Blocks"" Aren't Even Blocks

First, let's rule out what isn't actually writer's block:

**""I'm too tired""** isn't writer's block. It's exhaustion. Sleep fixes it, not motivation.

**""I don't have time""** isn't writer's block. It's scheduling. Calendar management fixes it, not writing advice.

**""My idea isn't good enough""** isn't writer's block. It's perfectionism. Your idea becomes good *through writing*, not thinking about it.

These aren't writing problems. They're life problems.

# The Real Blocks That Sabotage Your Writing

Then there are the actual blocks:

**The Perfectionist's Paralysis:** That voice saying ""this won't be good enough, don't even bother.""

**The Blank Page Terror:** Pure emptiness paralysis—not lacking ideas, but lacking direction.

**The ""I'm Lost"" Block:** Starting to write but not knowing what you're writing (scene? monologue? description?).

**The Comparison Trap:** Reading great writing and convincing yourself yours can never compete.

**The Stakes Block:** Writing something you don't actually care about finishing.

Each one needs a different solution.

# Why Generic Advice Fails

You've probably read:

*""Just write something""* — Too vague when you're paralyzed.

*""Don't wait for inspiration""* — Doesn't address the voice saying it won't be good.

*""Write every day""* — Doesn't work if your block is about form, not discipline.

*""Know your story first""* — Impossible if you discover your story through writing.

These aren't bad advice. They're just not *your* advice. They solve different problems than the one blocking you.

It's like being told to fix a headache by changing your shoes. Maybe that works if tight shoes caused it. But if it's caffeine withdrawal, you need different medicine entirely.

# What Actually Works

Here's the key insight:

**Writing flows because of clarity and constraints, not because of inspiration.**

When you know what you're writing, why it matters, and what boundaries you're working within—your brain stops debating and starts creating.

Constraints aren't limiting. They're liberating.

# The Gap

The difference between writers who breakthrough and writers who stay stuck?

They figure out which block they actually have.

At one point when you dont have an income or a job things get tough. I am a student and flexible jobs are scarce rn around here. Anyways after a lot of research and trial and error I found an easy way to make 10 bucks daily from your phone. 10 bucks is 10 bucks. It won’t make you rich but you can get yourself a coffee to motivate yourself. And again it’s for the ones outthere who just need something to keep going. Just download an app called Eureka (it has a money symbol with white background) And then make an account and take surveys. I tried others and they are scams or take too long so dont even bother. This one pays out instantly. My strategy is to aim for the ones that take less time or pay about $1. I make 8-10 bucks daily. You gotta spend a couple of hours (sometimes less) but it’s money. I do this early morning like at 6-8am. Then move on with my day. Ooooh and use this code for a sign up bonus they’ll give you some bucks for free as a new user 3FR5G7.

1pucjpn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pucjpn,Melvin’s Maggot Farm (18 minute read),"**Melvin’s Maggot Farm**

Melvin was bullied relentlessly. At times, it felt like the almost comical youth ultra-violence seen in the books of King and Burgess. The older kids would throw rocks at him, yank his hair, drag him around by his unfortunately large ears and throw him into the mud bank on the edge of the football field. Not too long ago, they set fire to his locker. I never knew who exactly did it, but that was the rumour I heard while waiting in the fire assembly out in the rain. 

Melvin was an easy target. 

He was thoroughly overweight, had pasty skin the color of bacon fat and smelled of something I don't care to mention. His nose looked like an invisible hand was pulling his nostrils firmly upwards and his hair was a shade of bistre with the texture of wet straw. He should be wearing glasses, but they'd only ever last a day and medicaid can only go so far. 

The worst bit was that he didn't have the smarts to make up for it. It wasn't like he was some quiet academic who'll eventually one up his bullies, not through violence but through success. In class, he was a failure. It wasn't all his fault though. Our school was pathetically underfunded, and Melvin had no way of getting the extra help he needed. He lived on the other side of the tracks, a caravan park on the edge of town that my mother warned me never to go near. I didn't know much about his home life, until it was all over the news.

Melvin did have one thing he excelled in though. When I was younger, around five or six, I was actually good friends with him. That was before it became common law not to be associated with him. Any time I spent with him, he'd shower me in bug facts. Even now, whenever he had a moment of solace at school, he'd spend it crouched in the corner of the yard, digging through the earth with his rusted fork. Any insects he found he'd store away in a little plastic bag he brought everywhere with him. He would fill that bag with just about any small creature he got his hands on. Then, when it was almost full, he'd seal it and turn its contents into a fine mush with a rock. For the rest of the week, you'd never see him without that bag. That is, until someone inevitably took it from him and he had to begin the process all over again. 

Now, nobody liked Melvin. I didn't either, not that I felt the need to violently show it. If you had told me last year that I'd end up spending my summer hanging out with him, I probably would've spat on you. It started with a little girl's bike. Me and my friends were dicking around in my cul-de-sac when Chet, the anthropomorphic glue that kept our friend group together, decided it would be funny to steal the bicycle of my neighbour's five year old daughter. We egged him on and he went through with it, and spent the rest of the day riding around on it. By the evening, he'd gotten tired of it and dumped it on the edge of the creek. 

As soon as I returned home, my mother confronted me about it. Apparently, that little girl spent the entire day balling her eyes out in the middle of the street. Admittedly, I snitched immediately. Chet ended up being fined an amount he never told us. After it came out that I was the one who grassed, I was persona non grata. Within the week, I knew what it was like to be Melvin. I spent yard time standing on my own, lamenting. Still, I never tried to find a friend in Melvin, thought I wouldn't have to stoop that low.

This all carried on until the summer, and beyond. By mid-June, social solitary confinement was getting to me. I thought long and hard about extending an olive branch to Melvin, but always decided against it. Eventually, my mind was made up for me. One morning my mother woke me up around noon and told me that there was a friend waiting for me at the door. I leapt out of bed, hoping it was someone from my old posse. Maybe even Chet, coming to make up. Instead, I found Melvin awkwardly standing on my front porch. 

“What do you want?” I launched into an interrogation.

“I was wondering if you'd come play with me today” He told me in his low, nasally voice. 

After a minute of internal debate, I thought “fuck it”. I shouted to my mom that I'll be back before dinner and left to spend the day with Melvin. 

Our first conversation together felt like dialogue from one of those shitty “how to make friends” books. He attempted some polite icebreakers, told a few bad jokes and offered me a piece of apple flavoured chewing gum. I declined since the packet had a bit of a stain on it. Before long, our interactions began to resemble normal. 

We made our way down to the creek, chatting and hitting things with sticks. Melvin is an interesting guy, once you get to know him. Apparently, he did live in the trailer park, but not in a trailer. His step-dad was the landlord, and they lived in a large house at the head of the grounds. His mother worked long hours at some place or another, and Melvin spent a lot of time home alone. 

As we were talking, and traversing our way over a moss covered log, Melvin suddenly squealed with delight and pointed at something I couldn't see. He jumped from the felled tree and dropped to his knees, scrounging around in the mud. I crouched next to him and watched in awe as he pulled out the largest, thickest grub I'd ever seen out from under a leaf. 

“Woah man, that's disgusting. Cool!” I yelled. 

Melvin held the grub uncomfortably close to his lips as he gazed longingly at it. Eventually, he snapped out of the trance and, with his free hand, rummaged around in a fanny pack. He pulled out a plastic zip-lock bag filled with a rancid paste of crushed invertebrates. He opened it with his teeth and gently placed the grub inside of it. He zipped it up again and stuffed it back inside of his pack. 

“Why do you do that?” I asked him, bluntly. 

“Do what?” Melvin replied.

“You know,” I answered, “That thing you always do. With the plastic bags and the insects”.

Melvin shrugged earnestly and that was the last we talked on that subject. 

This became my summer routine. Almost every other day, I'd spend hours hanging out with Melvin, usually down at the creek. I made sure, as best I could, to not be seen by any of my old friends. If it came out that I was spending my time with Melvin, any last hopes I had of clawing back my popularity were done for. 

On this particular day in July, me and Mel were walking to our usual spot. I peeped over the brow of a small yet steep hill just before he did. I quickly dropped to the ground when I saw Chet and a few others on the other side, making their way towards us. I scurried backwards and pathetically took off running, past Melvin and across to the other side of the clearing. Panting, I glanced from behind the tree I was using as my hiding place. I watched Chet and the gang lock eyes with Melvin as she climbed down from the slope. Before he could run like me, they pounced on him. I carried on watching and they buried his face into the mud, stamping on his hand and pinching his neck. I turned around and walked back home. 

I didn't see Melvin for a few days after that. When he did finally turn up at my door again, he had a black eye and a swollen lip. I stupidly asked him “Are you OK?” and left it at that. I didn't bother apologising. I didn't think there was anything to say sorry for at the time. 

It was that day he suggested we should hang out at his house. I was reluctant, but seeing the state he was in, I understood his reasoning. Despite my mother's warning, I followed Melvin to the trailer park. It was as run-down as I imagined. Bits of scrap metal and old cars were strewn across the front lawns of the caravans. From old wire hung wet clothes, that dripped a slow rain onto the already sodden earth underneath. I would've believed you if you told me the place was abandoned. 

Melvin’s house emerged further down the trail. It was an infancy bungalow, although it at least had a fresh lick of paint. Tacked onto the side of it was a small reception. Melvin informed me both of his parents were working. His father owned the source of the low rent, that being the dump next to the trailer park. He admitted that he didn't know where his mother worked, but that she was out all day, most days. 

The first thing I noticed was the dust. Every surface in his house was covered in a thin skin of dust and cobwebs. The place smelled strange. I honestly couldn't think of a better adjective for it. The wall paper was completely mismatched and when I looked more closely at the dozens of pictures hanging up, I realised that each of them seemed to display a different family. 

I was too preoccupied during the rest of our time together to ask him about it. We had drinks and snacks, of which he seemed to have an endless supply of both. We realised that we both were big fans of the same trading card game, so a few hours of that scorching hot day were spent in his room playing it. He had some pretty rare, expensive cards in his collection, and every time his back was turned I made sure to pocket one. 

Melvin’s room was a mess. It stank of piss and the corners were decorated with black mold. Clothes were everywhere, as were roaches. If one ever scuttled in front of him, he'd crush it with his fist and smear the mushed remains against his trouser legs to clean it from his hand. It was around this point I decided that spending the summer on my own wasn't all that bad. After we'd finished up with all the activities he could strain out of my visit, I excused myself to go home. 

“Wait!” He shouted, grabbing my wrist as I walked outside. 

“What?” I said, through gritted teeth, as I tried to politely pull myself free from his grasp. 

“There's something I really wanted to show you!” he snorted, “I can't believe I haven't brought my best friend to see it yet.”

I sighed 

“What do you want to show me, Melvin?”

“My maggot farm!” he said and began to lead me to it. 

The heat outside was much more bearable than it'd been earlier, but still thoroughly uncomfortable. Melvin ignored the rest of my questions, instead opting to silently drag. We ended up at the far corner of the trailer park. There was a few yards of lame forest cover between the edge of the trailer park and the corrugated iron fencing of his dad’s dump yard. A portion of the rusted fence had collapsed, and on top of it was an old, white water tank, as well as a myriad of other smaller pieces of trash. 

The tank was around four feet high and six feet wide, not including the lid. I stood back and watched Melvin struggle to push the immense metal lid off the top of the tank. I chuckled to myself and looked around. I only now realised how secluded we were. Before I could ask Melvin if he wanted any help, the lid fell back enough to release the foulest smelling odour I've ever known, before or since. It made me physically recoil and gag. I quickly covered my mouth and nose with my baseball cap. 

“What the actual fuck, Melvin!?” I said, muffled by the fabric. 

“It's my maggot farm.” Melvin told me. “I've been working on it for some time now. I collect roadkill a lot. I leave them to fester in this drum and after a while it becomes filled with maggots. Come have a closer look.”

I stared in pure shock at Melvin. He looked like a prideful child, finally getting to share his glittery art piece with his parents. When I didn't immediately take a peek at it, he spoke again, more forcefully this time. 

“I said come take a look.”

Reluctantly, I took two steps forward and glanced quickly over the metal rim, intent on getting it over with. For a second, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. I had to look again, longer this time, to make sure. 

The tank was full of rotting meat. Intestines and bits of fur and bone fragments added an extra texture to the rancid soup. A bizarre yellow, oily liquid pooled around the flesh. Worst of all, it was infested with countless maggots. The tiny white stubs squirmed in their viscous home. Clusters of holes gave way to more and more eggs, ready to hatch a new generation of maggots. Eventually, they'd become flies and start the process all over again. 

“Melvin, that has got to be the most disgusting thing I've-”

Before I could finish, Melvin swung a discarded tire iron into the back of my head. My world turned to nothing and I crumpled to the ground. I woke up an unknowable amount of time later. It could've been hours, more likely a few minutes. It was pitch black. Total, absolute darkness. I took a deep breath in and instantly knew where I was.

I tried to stand up but my head hit the inside of the lid. I slipped in the swirling stew of rot which rose up above my waist and fell. Some of it went in my mouth. I gagged and threw up, adding my vomit to the concoction. The smell was so foul it burnt away the hairs in my nostrils. I began to feel the miniscule, tearing bites of the maggots. It was like a swarm of gnats. I writhed around, imagining my unseen attacks borrowing into my skin and laying eggs. 

My head still hurt like hell. It took me a while to realise what had happened. In my state of panic, the first thing I checked were the cards in my back pocket. I figured they'd be ruined now, stained and soaking beyond any recognition. I felt for them, but they weren't there. I started to bang on the steel walls of my prison, screaming and hoping that someone would hear me. No one did. 

My foot brushed against a firm hunk of meat somewhere on the far side of the tank and I recoiled, making myself as small as possible, curling up into a fetal ball of fear. I'd never been more afraid in my life. My cousin told me about sniffing glue and not that long ago I tried it for myself. The gasses coming from the rot had a similar effect. I could feel my brain cells dying. 

Eventually, I was able to form a cognitive thought, that was that I should try to chip away at the patches of rust that lined the inside of the tank. I felt around directly in front of me for something that could be used as a tool. I imagined I'd find a sturdy piece of bone, but I found something far different. It had a metallic center and two rigid strips of fabric attached to either side. It was a watch. I held it up and felt around in the darkness for the buttons. I pressed one, and all it did was beep. I'm sure that had some effect, but nothing of use. I pressed another one, and likewise all it did was beep. The third, however, triggered the small, digital display light. In the brief second of vision it caused, I saw that there was someone else in here with me. 

I froze. My constant state of thrashing, caused by the maggots penetrating my skin, stopped. With a shaking hand, I pressed the LED on again, holding it down this time. Sitting across from me was Melvin. He was naked, or at the very least didn't have his shirt on. He was watching me with content eyes. He smiled when he knew that I'd seen him. I realised that the piece of meat my foot brushed against minutes before was his leg. 

“M… M… M…” 

I was a mess. I struggled to form basic thoughts, let alone a challenging question. 

“What… the… fuck..” was all I managed to spit out. 

Melvin giggled to himself, but said nothing. Instead, he went back to picking maggots out from their bloody nest and stuffing them in his mouth. I began to gag and heave again. There was physically nothing left in me to throw up, so instead my vomit was composed of stomach acid and bile. Once I was finished spilling my guts, I remembered the plan. 

I shoved the watch into my pocket, not wanting to have to look at Melvin anymore. I felt around in the sludge, and almost immediately found what I was looking for. It was a chunk of jaggard jaw bone, from the skull of a dear or large dog. I turned and started to scrape it against a patch of brittle rust. Gradually, I felt layers of oxidised metal flakes peel off. Finally, with a powerful stab, I pushed the bone straight through it. A small, olive-sized hole let in the first ray of natural light in what felt like forever. I quickly pressed my mouth against the hole, accidentally breathing in tiny shards of rust as I gasped for fresh air. 

While I pressed my body against the walls of the drum, I felt something below me. I couldn't reach with my hand, but my shin brushed against yet another patch of rust. It was right at the base, where a bad welding job attached the two main parts of the water tank. With my mouth still clasped around freedom, I kicked violently at the fragmenting barrier. Moving my legs was like trying to run in a vat of molasses. Again and again and again I kicked at it until finally my foot broke through. I was filled with hope and stamped at the loose debris, trying desperately to create an opening large enough for me to squeeze through. The fetid liquid oozed out as the gaping wound in the side of the tank grew wide enough for a twelve year old to pull himself through. 

“Hey, HEY!” Melvin roared from right behind me. 

I ignored him and took a deep breath from the smaller of the two holes. I pinched my nose, closed my eyes and plunged beneath the rotting surface. I left my baseball cap behind me as I felt around for my exit. I grabbed the rim, cutting my hand on the sharp edges. I yanked myself down and, finally, out. Like a newborn, my head, covered in filth, erupted from the steel womb. It was followed by my two arms, which grabbed onto the grass in front of me. I began pulling myself out. 

My forward motion stopped at my waist. I was stuck fast, tearing clumps of grass from the sodden earth as I tried desperately to free myself. Suddenly, I felt someone grab my foot. Melvin was trying to drag me back in. I screamed and planted my hand on either side of the entrance, painfully pushing myself forward. I kicked back, struggling against his vice-like grip. Finally, the sole of my shoe made contact with his jaw. The momentum of the strike propelled me from the drum and sent me tumbling out onto the rot-soaked ground. 

As soon as I was free, I bolted. I staggered to my feet and ran as fast as my weary body could manage. I plodded through the tangled foliage, narrowly avoiding a discarded washing machine. I didn't look back as I streaked past the trailers, their occupants watching me in confusion and disgust. I cut through the creek, not wanting anyone to see me in this state. I emerged near my house, and walked the last few yards, exhausted. 

This took place in the Summer of 1995, and was a pivotal moment in my life. I go to therapy often, not only because of the events of that day but it does tend to come up in almost every session. My mother was so disturbed by what happened to me, she rang the police. A cop turned up at my house to talk to. He was trying to figure out exactly what had happened. Once I spewed my account, and he finished his coffee, he thanked us and turned to leave. Just before he did, he spotted the digital watch in the kitchen bin. It was the one that had been in my pocket since the incident, the one my mother threw away along with my ruined clothes.  

He turned white when he saw it. He grabbed some tissue paper and wrapped his hand in it, picking up the filth covered watch which had, to the cop, an oddly familiar gecko pattern on the straps.

“Where did you find this?” he said in a low, worrying voice. 

I told him that I was the watch I mentioned in my account, the one I found in the maggot farm. 

My parents never told me what happened next. It was to protect me, I suppose. A day later, it was plastered all over the local news that a small business owner and dedicated family man, who I realised was Melvin's dad, had been arrested. Anytime it was mentioned, my mother would quickly turn the channel over. As far as I could remember, I never saw Melvin again. He stopped showing up to school, and the prevailing theory was that he’d been made to live with his Aunt the state over. Not that I could talk to any about it, as in Melvin’s absence, I became the new punching-bag for anyone with a broken home life for the rest of middle school.

I'm forty-two now, and have kids of my own. A boy and a girl, aged six and eight. I moved away from my hometown long, long ago, and now live a quaint, happy life. Recently, my brother visited, and told me about a Facebook group he recently joined that was dedicated to my old school. 

Yesterday evening, I sat down with my kids to show them what I had to put up with, and to get a nice dose of nostalgia. The most recent post was about a boy I didn't recognise, but soon remembered was the younger brother of my old friend Simon. A few days ago was the 30th anniversary of his disappearance. The comments were filled with outpourings of sympathy and reminiscing. I looked at the photo and then at my son. As a parent, hearing about these sorts of stories really strikes a nerve. I studied the boy in the picture while my children fired a barrage of questions at me. His sweet grin and rosy cheeks brought a tear to my eye as I mentally put myself in the position of his grieving parents all those years ago. 

I wonder what my children were thinking as they watched me drop the phone, then fall to my knees, wailing and crying into my hands. After all, they didn't notice the watch the boy in the photo was wearing, nor did they know the significance of the gecko pattern straps.

Letter I wrote to you,

Dear (Name)

You know it really is crazy how quickly a person can become filled with such a feeling of care, appreciation and admiration for another person in such a short amount of time. That is exactly what happened when I met you.

From the first time I met you and from the first few conversations we i was in awe of how someone who had such a sad, difficult and rough start to their life could make it through all of those times and become such a strong, respectable and kind woman. 

This made me feel for the first time in my life like I really met someone who could be my person. Straight off the bat I felt like we had this instant spark because of all the hobbies and interests we had in common. Not only that but also because of the way we both instantly felt so comfortable together. It was just so easy for us to talk and enjoy each others company. It really is something I had never felt with anyone else before meeting you. I am also fairly sure you felt something similar.

Those feelings I gained for you and the connection that I felt like we instantly had, for me very quickly developed into a feeling of wanting to be your rock you could lean on whenever you needed. I truely came to care for you on a very deep level and it very much hurt to see you upset.

That is why I find myself writing this letter. I am not writing this letter as a way of begging to have you back and I don't even expect a response. I am writing it as a way for one last time to explain to you how I really felt because I was not able to while we were together or during our last conversation.

(Name) you truely are an amazing, caring and beautiful person. I find it crazy how deeply I came to care for you in such a short time. You had such a profoundly positive impact on me. If there was a way I could rewind time I would do it in a heartbeat and do things differently. Our time together may not have been long, however you are someone I will truely never forget. If I ever hear from you again it would be the biggest blessing this world could bestow.

I am truely devastated that I broke your trust and your boundaries. It was selfish and showed a complete lack of care. When all I really wanted to ever so was show you how much I felt and cared for you. I should have found different ways, correct ways to do so. I am so, so truly sorry for doing so and making you so uncomfortable around me. 

My actions towards you and the end result of pushing you away is something I will never forgive myself for. I took a long while to think about the decision you made, understand that you did it to distance and protect yourself from potential more serious harm and I understand your decision. I do promise you I will learn from the things I did to you.

(Name) I hope you find someone that treats you and shows you the amount of care, admiration and love for you to do well that I did and then some. Because you only deserve the best in this world. I just wish that I could have been the one to give you that, in the end though all that really matters to me is your happiness.

I wish you all the best.

Company did not like me taking too much time off and I just quit. Been couple of years. No property, still rent, but more than 50 x expenses in GIA, ISA, SIPP. So I guess I dont need to work for financial reasons. 

Initially just wanted a 1 year break, but I am an inertia guy. I dont change state easily. During working years never imagined I would stop working but that is where I am now. Worked couple of decades in one company so no idea how to even write a CV. Worked in enterprise tech, but not in core engineering ie product development, not functional, not a manager either. I was a tech in professional services which is neither here nor there. But I was a valued member of team and was good at research / troubleshooting, working with customer. I was a techie but not a hotshot developer. 

Without work I am not bored per se, I waste a lot of time listening to talk radio but I like it, follow various blogs / vlogs on tech, maths etc. I read what interests me, sometimes drift etc. But no goals. I am single / no family. Fortunately no vices but my sleep schedule is messed up : 3 AM to 11 AM. I think its important to have routine and a sense of fulfilment/problem solving for dopamine. Also social aspect of work. Former colleagues have little time. 

Met an old colleague recently for coffee. He took one look at me and said ""I think you will never come back to paid work"". Maybe I looked too chilled. After hearing that I feel like a failure. 

I think I need to find something interesting in tech. Not smart enough to work in FAANG / Fintech. Age(57), AI/LLM, general economic slowdown, couple year gap means it wont be easy to get in. 

Any suggestions ? Maybe tech opportunities in large UK non tech businesses. Maybe too late and I have to accept retirement.

No matter what I do, I've gotten very little sweetness and fruit, and there is a heavy taste of chemical bitterness.

I've tried everything from B&W's four pour recipe at 477 microns with the ZP6, all the way to 800 microns, I've tried Switch immersion, everything.

It seems to be the coffee. Some defect in the early Dec '25 batch making it taste very chemicaly. Bummer given the extremely high price and generally great quality at Hydrangea.

Has anyone had success with this as a pourover? What recipe and date?",12,1766544389.0,pourover,32,0.77,False

I've never had one and wanted something sweet so here we are. As you can see it's bloomed on the outside but mostly fine on the inside. It still melts in the mouth but has a slightly oily mouth feel. Most likely from the fat that separated out due to the age. Otherwise it tastes fine. Old but fine. I've seen them so bloomed they turn to powder which you then add to coffee or hot chocolate.

I’m more on the quiet/observant side. I prefer real conversations over small talk. Coffee over bars. Depth over noise. If you’re expecting constant texting or high-energy chaos, we probably won’t click.

-Someone who’s also tired of the games and ambiguity
-Not perfection, just mutual effort
-someone who is just naturally happy

Early this morning I poured out a customers whole cup of fucking coffee WHOLE CUP all over her items and the counter. It looked just like one of our clearance cups and she put it right with her fucking items and walked away while I was scanning. My manager was right there and watched the whole damn thing unfold. And yes the customer was lowkey a bitch about it even my manager pointed it out after she left, however as a broke coffee LOVING AND LIVING girl I understand the frustration and the lady handled it better than I expected. Then I get off work at 11:30am and come home to my husband and take a nap and have absolutely insane and awful dreams, I wake up and I can’t find any indicator on my bitch ass iPhone if it’s am or pm and my work app OF COURSE was stuck on this work day because it hadn’t updated it as completed since the last time I looked at it I was still on the clock. And it’s pitch black outside and the whole house is silent. I thought I was late for work. So I text my manager freaking out that I’m leaving now then to realize it is infact THE PM and my manager texts back “lol you poor thing go back to sleep🩷🩷🩷🩷” 😭😭😭😭 my manager also helped me clean up the coffee and told me she also thought that lady’s cup was ours and she would have done the same exact thing.

1puccaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1puccaj/the_5_blocks_nobody_talks_aboutand_how_to_fix/,The 5 Blocks Nobody Talks About—And How to Fix Yours,"You sit down to write. The page is blank. Your mind is blank.

You've tried everything:

* Changed your environment
* Adjusted your schedule
* Read other writers for inspiration
* Taken walks
* Made coffee
* Dimmed the lights

Nothing worked.

So you googled ""overcome writer's block"" and found 50 articles saying the same thing: *""Just write and don't wait for inspiration.""*

You tried. It didn't help.

Here's why: **You're probably using the wrong strategy for your specific block.**

# Writer's Block Isn't One Problem

Most advice treats writer's block as a single issue with one solution.

It's not.

Writer's block is actually multiple different problems masquerading as the same thing. Each one requires a different strategy.

# Some ""Blocks"" Aren't Even Blocks

First, let's rule out what isn't actually writer's block:

**""I'm too tired""** isn't writer's block. It's exhaustion. Sleep fixes it, not motivation.

**""I don't have time""** isn't writer's block. It's scheduling. Calendar management fixes it, not writing advice.

**""My idea isn't good enough""** isn't writer's block. It's perfectionism. Your idea becomes good *through writing*, not thinking about it.

These aren't writing problems. They're life problems.

# The Real Blocks That Sabotage Your Writing

Then there are the actual blocks:

**The Perfectionist's Paralysis:** That voice saying ""this won't be good enough, don't even bother.""

**The Blank Page Terror:** Pure emptiness paralysis—not lacking ideas, but lacking direction.

**The ""I'm Lost"" Block:** Starting to write but not knowing what you're writing (scene? monologue? description?).

**The Comparison Trap:** Reading great writing and convincing yourself yours can never compete.

**The Stakes Block:** Writing something you don't actually care about finishing.

Each one needs a different solution.

# Why Generic Advice Fails

You've probably read:

*""Just write something""* — Too vague when you're paralyzed.

*""Don't wait for inspiration""* — Doesn't address the voice saying it won't be good.

*""Write every day""* — Doesn't work if your block is about form, not discipline.

*""Know your story first""* — Impossible if you discover your story through writing.

These aren't bad advice. They're just not *your* advice. They solve different problems than the one blocking you.

It's like being told to fix a headache by changing your shoes. Maybe that works if tight shoes caused it. But if it's caffeine withdrawal, you need different medicine entirely.

# What Actually Works

Here's the key insight:

**Writing flows because of clarity and constraints, not because of inspiration.**

When you know what you're writing, why it matters, and what boundaries you're working within—your brain stops debating and starts creating.

Constraints aren't limiting. They're liberating.

# The Gap

The difference between writers who breakthrough and writers who stay stuck?

They figure out which block they actually have.
