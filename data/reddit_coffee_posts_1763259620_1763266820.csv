I'm having a hard time dealing with the fact that my coffee creamer costs me 4-5 points a day.
I don't really drink coffee, but I do enjoy a morning cup of brewed cacao as an alternative. I like a little sweetness, but I can't tolerate any O-calorie sweeteners (so, no stevia, monk fruit, Sucralose. It also means no Premier Protein shakes as coffee creamer or anything sugar-free unless it's completely unsweetened.

I'm not bothered by this most of the time. I'm fine with it for things like ACTUAL desserts. It doesn't bother me if other people can have a sugar-free cheesecake for next to nothing while I have to settle for spending 10 points for a sliver. I'm a believer that part of dessert is a little sugar. But when it comes to my creamer, it's a little irritating.

I don't really care for just plain half and half or unsweetened Nutpods in my cacao (I WISH I did; | used to enjoy Nutpods in my coffee, but I can't tolerate coffee anymore).

Here's a comprehensive list - the store doesn't need to have all - it'd be appreciated if you guys could give me a recommended store for each category though. I do also want to get good price though - so just suggesting Amazon USA is probably not the best because I'd wan to atleast get some semblance of competitive pricing. Most of the stuff doesn't really have a budget in the sense that I think I'd be able to afford most stuff but I'll specify the range of what I'm looking for where necessary.

I've previously got the Picopresso from Ashcoffee - but their contact has been pretty unresponsive + most of the stuff is out of stock there (like I wanted a Picopresso pressure gauge - but its perpetually out of stock). Another store I know of is Something's brewing - but havent bought from them

1. **Espresso Machine** \- Range here is probably 1lakh-ish? Obviously open to things lower than this range but the concern is where to buy it. Breville Barista Express is something I've used previously and costs 85k-99k on Amazon India but I've heard that there are problems as it doesn't have a fuse and getting the IC from Europe (?) is pretty expensive. So any stores that provide that kind of support/alternative premium espresso machines that don't have similar problems would be great.
2. **Electric Grinder** \- There was a notion list recently on this sub but most of the links for the premium stuff was from Amazon USA - would love to know if there are alternative stores that carry the premium electric ones. Edit: I do not need a manual grinder - I have a Timemore C2 which works perfectly fine and now want a premium electric grinder.
3. **WDT tools + tamper** \- Wouldn't mind getting one of the premium ones - like the MHW bomber cyclone stuff - with magnets and such.
4. **Espresso glasses** \- Want transparent double walled stuff - no clue where to look for and price compare lol.
5. **Coffee** \- Mostly just get Blue tokai for regular coffee and homeblend for decaf - but want to branch out and try others too - specially some of the whiskey barrel aged stuff - so would like suggestions.

Just a list of stores for each would be really great so that I know I'm looking on reputable places.

1oybnam,https://www.reddit.com/r/productlect/comments/1oybnam/why_wont_my_snow_blower_start_in_cold_weather/,Why won't my snow blower start in cold weather?,"Look, I've been there. You wake up to a foot of fresh snow, grab your coffee, and head out to fire up the snow blower. You pull the cord once, twice, maybe ten times. Nothing. It's freezing cold, your driveway isn't getting any clearer, and you're starting to wonder if you need a new machine.

Before you panic, let me walk you through why your snow blower won't start when it's really cold outside.

**The Oil Gets Thick**

This is probably the biggest culprit. When temperatures drop below freezing, the oil in your engine turns into something closer to molasses. Your engine has to work way harder to turn over, and sometimes it just can't do it. I learned this the hard way last winter.

The fix is pretty simple though. Check your owner's manual and make sure you're using the right winter-weight oil. Most snow blowers need 5W-30 oil for cold weather instead of the regular 10W-30 you might use in warmer months.

**Old Gas is Your Enemy**

Gas doesn't last forever. If you left fuel sitting in your snow blower all summer, it's probably gone bad. Old gas makes starting almost impossible, especially in cold weather. The ethanol in modern gas absorbs moisture and gums everything up.

I always drain my gas at the end of winter now, or at least add fuel stabilizer. Fresh gas makes a massive difference when you need your machine to start on that first cold day.

**The Carburetor is Frozen or Clogged**

Cold weather can cause moisture in your carburetor to freeze. Or if you had old gas in there, it might be clogged with varnish and gunk. Either way, fuel can't get to the engine properly.

Sometimes you can fix this by moving the snow blower into a warmer garage for an hour. If it's clogged, you might need to clean the carburetor or have someone do it for you.

**Dead or Weak Battery**

If you have an electric start model, cold weather drains batteries fast. A battery that worked fine in November might be completely dead by January. Try jumping it or charging it overnight.

**The Spark Plug Needs Attention**

Spark plugs can get fouled up or just wear out. They're cheap and easy to replace. Pull it out, check if it's dirty or corroded, and either clean it or swap it for a new one. In cold weather, your engine needs a strong spark to fire up.

**Here's What I Do Now**

After dealing with these headaches for years, I've got a routine. I use fresh gas with stabilizer, switch to winter oil before the season starts, and keep my snow blower in the garage when possible. I also start it up once or twice before the first big snow just to make sure everything's working.

Sometimes though, you reach a point where your old snow blower just isn't worth the trouble anymore. If you're constantly fighting with it every winter, it might be time to look at newer options. I've found that checking out [modern snow blower models](https://athomewave.com/snow-blower) can actually save you money in the long run when you factor in repairs and all the frustration.

**Quick Troubleshooting Checklist**

- Check the fuel (is it fresh?)
- Check the oil (is it winter-weight?)
- Look at the spark plug (is it clean?)
- Check the battery if you have electric start
- Make sure the choke is set correctly
- Prime it a few times before pulling

Most of the time, it's one of these simple things. The cold just makes everything harder on small engines. They need fresh fuel, the right oil, and a little extra care to run properly when it's freezing outside.

If you've tried everything and it still won't start, you can take it to a repair shop, but honestly the cost of repairs sometimes gets close to what a new machine would cost. That's when I usually head over to [browse current snow blower options](https://athomewave.com/snow-blower) and see what's available.

Bottom line: cold weather starting problems are usually fixable with basic maintenance. Take care of your machine before winter hits, and it'll take care of you when the snow starts falling.",1,1763264973.0,productlect,0,1.0,False

By “alternate,” I mean one is on duty while the other sleeps. The benefit of 5-on/3-off (instead of 16-on/8-off) is that all officers are rested enough when attacking a convoy, so I rarely use coffee, only if I’m pinned by destroyers for more than 16 hours.

1oybkm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1oybkm4/which_types_of_model_train_are_available/,Which types of model train are available?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been getting into model trains lately, and honestly, it's way more interesting than I thought it would be. There's actually a bunch of different types to choose from, and I wanted to share what I learned because it can get confusing pretty fast.

**The Main Scales You'll See**

The biggest thing about model trains is the scale. Basically, that's how big the train is compared to a real one.

HO scale is probably the most popular. It's about 1:87 scale, which means it's small enough to fit on a decent-sized table but big enough that you can see all the cool details. Most people start here because there's tons of tracks, buildings, and accessories you can buy for it.

N scale is smaller – like 1:160. If you don't have much space, this one's perfect. You can fit a whole railroad setup on a coffee table. The trains are tiny but surprisingly detailed.

O scale is the bigger option at 1:48. These trains have serious weight to them and look super realistic. Lionel makes a bunch of these, and they're what a lot of people remember from their childhood. They need more room though.

Then there's Z scale, which is the smallest at 1:220. I'm talking really tiny here. And G scale is the huge outdoor one that people run in their gardens.

**Electric vs Steam Style**

Most modern model trains run on electricity through the tracks. But you can get models that look like old steam engines, diesel locomotives, or modern electric trains. It just depends on what era you're into.

I spent hours looking at different options online, and honestly [this collection on Amazon](https://athomewave.com/model-train) has a really solid variety of model train sets for beginners and experienced collectors. They've got different scales and styles all in one place.

**Ready-to-Run vs Building Your Own**

Some train sets come ready to go right out of the box. You just put the track together and you're running trains in like 20 minutes. Others are kits where you build the locomotive yourself, paint it, and customize everything.

For beginners, I'd definitely say go with ready-to-run. You can always get into the detailed building stuff later once you know what you like.

**Digital vs Analog**

Here's something I didn't know at first – there's digital command control (DCC) and regular analog. With analog, you control speed with a simple dial. With DCC, you can control multiple trains on the same track independently, plus lights, sounds, and all that fancy stuff. It costs more but it's pretty cool.

**My Honest Take**

Start simple. Get a basic set in HO or N scale, see if you actually enjoy it, then expand from there. The hobby can get expensive fast if you go all-in right away.

If you're ready to check out some options, [head over here to see what's available](https://athomewave.com/model-train). There's sets for every budget and skill level.

The cool thing about model trains is there's no wrong answer. Whether you want a simple loop on a board or a massive detailed layout with mountains and towns, you can make it happen. Just pick a scale that fits your space and budget, and go from there.

It’s incredibly difficult to make friends my age, and since most of my friends have gone off on their own lives (had kids, started families, moved, etc.) its become extremely difficult to make new ones in my area (especially ones who have the same interests). So, I thought why not check reddit. 

I’m not looking for a lot of friends. Preferably I’m cool with just one that I can get to know, get close with, and be genuine long-term friends with. I’m not completely closed off to it being something more, but that’s not my main intention here. 

About me? I’m alternative, have piercings (no tattoos yet) and am pretty genderqueer for the most part. 

When it comes to music? I mainly listen to Shoegaze, Dream pop, indie, folk, jazz, and alternative music (a couple of my favorite artists are Ethel Cain, Nothing, Whirr, Slow Crush, Cigarettes After S*x, Sufjan Stevens, and Chelsea Days). 

As for hobbies? There’s a lot. Theres reading, writing, hiking, painting, knitting, music, etc. 

As for specifics… I really love reading literary fiction. I’m not a big fan of genre fiction (could never get into sci-fi, fantasy, or romance). It’s just not my thing. I’m more-so into fiction that really dives into the human experience in really neat, unique ways (think Joy Williams, Clarice Lispector, etc). I particularly love short stories.

Aside from reading and writing, I’ve also been trying to get into knitting, making music, and painting again (it’s been awhile). 

Philosophy club was one of my favorites in college, so don’t be surprised if I’d love to chat your ear off about that as well. 

I’d love to connect and find someone who’s similar in interest, likes having deep talks, and would maybe even be one day open to smoking and chatting over coffee late at night talking about life. I’m not looking for quick friends for a bored night, I’d really love to connect with someone on a real level.

The premise is admittedly unusual but also kind of sweet when you think about it. We correspond like we're already in that comfortable middle period of a relationship where you can be simultaneously earnest and ridiculous, where the pressure to impress has evaporated and been replaced by actual curiosity about another person. We'd write emails about nothing in particular and everything all at once. We'd exchange photos of each other only at the beginning, not because we're auditioning but because it's genuinely nice to put a face to the voice you're getting to know, and because transparency matters when you're trying to build something real, even if that something starts out as an experiment in epistolary connection.

I want to be clear about intentions here because that matters. This is about seeing if two strangers can write their way toward genuine connection, whether that becomes friendship or pen pal situation or potentially something more, and whatever unfolds would happen at whatever pace feels right to both people involved. No pressure, no weird expectations, just the space to be human together in text form and see what develops naturally.

If you're reading this and thinking ""this sounds either delightfully weird or weirdly delightful,"" then maybe you should send me a message, and we can start pretending we're already in love until one day we realize we've accidentally stopped pretending.

# 🎧 Daily Music Beats



**November 16, Sunday, 2025**

***

## 📰 ***Today's Headline***

**The Music Industry pivots on AI, as Universal Music Group (UMG) and Text-to-Music startup Udio announce a landmark licensing settlement.** This unprecedented agreement signals the major label's shift from purely litigious resistance to strategic, licensed partnership in the generative AI space. The deal, which remains largely undisclosed financially, centers on launching a new subscription platform next year where fans can create remixes and custom tracks using UMG's licensed catalog, provided artists *opt-in* to the service. While the move is hailed by some as a necessary step to monetize AI-driven creativity and secure creator compensation, it raises immediate ethical questions from artist and songwriter coalitions demanding full transparency and explicit consent for *all* AI training use of their work. The settlement draws a clear line in the sand between Udio, now a partner, and rival AI firms like Suno, whose copyright infringement lawsuit remains ongoing.

***

## 📈 ***What's Moving Now (Trending Genres)***

* **Hip-Hop/Drill** – The genre is seeing a new wave of highly theatrical, cinematic music videos and short-form storytelling taking off on platforms like TikTok and YouTube Shorts, driving rapid track virality. This ""visual-first"" approach focuses on world-building around the artist's persona, turning releases into cultural events. Breakout artist **Lil' Dagger** is exemplifying this trend, with his latest single debuting on the Hot 100 purely off the strength of its controversial, highly stylized music short.

* **Acoustic Neo-Folk** – This genre's resurgence is fueled by a major-label push for authentic, 'unproduced' sounds, directly contrasting the heavily synthetic pop landscape. Streaming platforms are curating popular ""Coffee House Chill"" and ""Campfire Sessions"" playlists, offering lucrative positions to artists who embody a genuine singer-songwriter aesthetic. This has led to the revival of 90s alt-country and a new, more earnest subgenre gaining critical traction, headlined by veteran's resurgence artist **Joni Saffron**.

* **Afrobeats Fusion (Amapiano/Gqom)** – The South African Amapiano sound, characterized by deep basslines, synthetic pads, and a shuffle rhythm, is crossing over globally through collaborations with top-tier Afrobeats and European Pop artists. This sonic crossover is giving Alté a harder, grittier edge, making it more palatable to a global urban audience. The niche rhythm is gaining wider traction as artists like **Tyla** have paved the way for more complex African diaspora sounds to enter the global consciousness.

* **Generative AI Pop** – Following the recent success of the AI-generated track 'Walk My Walk' which recently topped the Billboard Hot 100 under the artificial artist 'Rust,' the commercial viability of AI-composed music is now proven. The genre is trending not for its sonic originality, but for the ethical and philosophical debates it sparks, including the finding that 97% of listeners cannot distinguish between AI and human-composed songs, forcing the industry to grapple with mandatory labeling and royalty structures.

***

## 💰 ***The Biz (Industry Hot Takes)***

* **Hot Take 1: The Streaming Wars.** **TikTok** has tightened its grip on music discovery and the streaming ecosystem by rolling out a 'Share to TikTok' button for **Amazon Music** users, completing its integration with all three major streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music). This move cements TikTok's role as the industry's primary ""chart kingmaker"" and further heats up the competition, as streaming services now aggressively integrate with social platforms to maximize discovery and combat stream manipulation, which is a major royalty dispute issue.

* **Hot Take 2: Deals and Ownership.** A coalition of North American songwriter and composer groups has issued a strong statement demanding transparency and creator consent regarding **Universal Music Group’s** landmark settlement with AI company **Udio**. They are calling on labels and publishers to commit to explicit creator opt-in and fair compensation for *all* AI training uses, expressing concern over the non-disclosed terms of the UMG/Udio deal and the broader implications for artists signing away their rights in employment contracts.

* **Hot Take 3: Web3 and NFTs.** While the NFT market has cooled, the use of blockchain technology for ticketing is seeing renewed interest. Major touring artists are beginning to test smart contracts and NFT-backed tickets to combat ticket touting and ensure verified resale at fan-friendly prices, directly addressing the widespread demand from artists like Coldplay and Dua Lipa for price caps. This focus on utility-based Web3 integration is replacing speculative art drops.

***

## 📊 ***The Numbers Game (Chart Deep Dive)***

* **US Chart Focus: Billboard Hot 100/200.** The biggest chart story is the unprecedented ascent of the AI-generated track, ""**Walk My Walk**"" by the synthetic artist **Rust**, which recently hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. This marks the first time an artificially created composition has topped the chart, signaling a profound historical milestone and immediately escalating the debate about source authenticity, copyright, and the definition of an ""artist"" in the digital age. This victory for generative music is the direct result of a public that, according to recent surveys, is overwhelmingly unable to distinguish between AI and human-made tracks.

* **UK/Global Chart Focus: Official Charts Company/Spotify Global.** A significant global move involves the sustained chart dominance of tracks from the highly-anticipated new album by **Ariana Grande**, which broke a new **Spotify Global** record for most first-week streams by a female artist, displacing Taylor Swift. This achievement underscores the increasing power of massive, pre-release social media campaigns and the concentrated effort by major labels to secure global streaming records on release day.

***

## 💿 ***Out Today (Fresh Releases)***

* **The Strokes – *Future Present Past Imperfect* (Album)**
    This surprise EP features three newly recorded tracks and one previously unreleased demo from the *Is This It* era. The new songs blend the familiar, slightly lo-fi garage rock swagger of their early days with a more polished, synthy production reminiscent of *The New Abnormal*, pleasing long-time fans and generating immediate critical buzz as a potential return to form.

* **Tate McRae – “She’s Over You” (Single)**
    The lead single for her upcoming sophomore album, ""She’s Over You"" is an explosive, dance-pop track co-written by Olivia Rodrigo and produced by Max Martin. Its slick, high-energy production and instantly catchy chorus have already made it a viral soundbite on TikTok ahead of its release, making it one of the most highly-anticipated lead singles of the year.

* **St. Vincent – “Cult of the New” (Single)**
    A sharp, angular, and intensely textural track, Annie Clark's latest is a commentary on internet culture and celebrity, featuring production notes that include the use of AI-generated audio manipulations layered with vintage analog synths. Critics are calling it a ""glitchy, dystopian masterpiece"" that re-establishes her position as a vanguard of art-rock.

* **D4vd – *Withered* (Album)**
    The long-awaited debut studio album from the R&B/Alternative singer, whose release coincides with immense real-world controversy. The album showcases D4vd’s signature emotional, reverb-soaked style, but fan and media reception is primarily overshadowed by the recent cancellation of his tour and the ongoing homicide investigation linked to the discovery of a body in a car registered to him.

* **Best of the Rest:**
    * **Charli XCX – “House” ft. FKA twigs** – A futuristic, hyper-pop banger about domesticity and desire.
    * **Silversun Pickups – “The Wreckage”** – The soaring, guitar-driven lead single from their newly announced 2026 album.

***

## 🌍 ***World Sounds (Global Beats)***

* **Regional Focus: Africa (Nigerian Alté/Drill).** Nigerian Alté, a vibrant genre that blends Afrobeats with global sounds like hip-hop, R&B, and electronic music, is finding new commercial life through collaborations with UK Drill producers. This sonic crossover is giving Alté a harder, grittier edge, making it more palatable to a global urban audience. The breakthrough of the artist **Obi Nduka** is significant, as he blends Yoruba proverbs with UK Drill cadences, positioning the sound for further growth in North American markets, driven by specialized Spotify editorial support.

* **Euro/Australia Highlight.** The final headliners for the legendary **Glastonbury Festival 2026** were announced, confirming a massive UK/EU summer. Meanwhile, from the Oceania region, the psychedelic rock band **Tame Impala** has surprised fans by announcing an unexpected 20th-anniversary re-issue of their first EP, which is expected to dominate vinyl chart sales in both the UK and Australia this holiday season.

***

## 🎤 ***Who To Watch (Artist Spotlight)***

* **D4vd: The Breakthrough Story.** David Anthony Burke, known as D4vd, skyrocketed to fame on the back of his viral bedroom-pop hit ""Romantic Homicide,"" showcasing his self-taught, iPhone-recorded style. His journey from recording in his sister's closet to a major label deal with Interscope was a compelling story of Gen Z musical discovery. However, his rise has been tragically overshadowed by a homicide investigation following the discovery of human remains in a vehicle registered to him, forcing the cancellation of his *Withered* tour and positioning his legal battle as a major industry headline.

* **Smokey Robinson: The Veteran's Resurgence.** Motown legend Smokey Robinson is back in the headlines not for a musical comeback, but for a high-stakes, $500 million defamation lawsuit he filed against four former housekeepers who accused him of sexual assault. This filing follows his initial denial and a criminal investigation launch, with Robinson accusing the claimants of a fabrication for extortion. The legal battle is a significant, shocking story in the music world, forcing the public to re-evaluate the legacy of an 85-year-old American music icon amidst these serious, ongoing allegations.

***

## 🗺️ ***On The Road (Tour And Live Music Buzz)***

* **Major Tour Announcement.** British rock band **Coldplay** and pop singer-songwriter **Dua Lipa** have joined a coalition of major artists demanding the UK government cap ticket resale prices to protect fans from touts. While not a tour announcement, the high-profile call highlights the ongoing crisis in live music accessibility and points toward a future where artists may adopt more innovative, fan-first ticketing strategies, like blockchain verification, to ensure affordability for genuine fans.

* **Festival News.** The **Primavera Sound** festival has announced its full 2026 lineup, which is already generating huge hype for its genre-spanning curation and the inclusion of several major K-Pop acts in prime-time slots, solidifying K-Pop's position as a major festival draw globally.

***

## 🕰️ ***On This Day (Music Trivia)***

On **November 16, 1993**, legendary rapper **Wu-Tang Clan** released their groundbreaking debut album, ***Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)***. The album's innovative sound, which blended dark, cinematic beats with distinct lyrical styles from the nine members, launched the group to global stardom. It is widely regarded as one of the most influential hip-hop albums of all time, fundamentally shaping the sound of East Coast rap and introducing the concept of multi-member hip-hop collectives with individual solo careers.

(Part 2),"I realize now that I never described the actual night that Abby was taken. I was so caught up with missing Abby that explaining *how* Abby had come to be missing completely slipped my mind. I will recount to you the events of that fateful evening and share with you the events of today.

It was a little over a week ago now, a Friday. I had just finished work for the week and was walking back towards the apartment when I saw the first indication that something was off. Two black vans were parked on the street outside the apartment, engines still running. Next, I noticed that all the other residents of the apartment were standing outside looking up at the building; most were in their pajamas, some were still in their work uniforms, having just gotten off their shifts like I had.

All of the other residents except for Abby.

I searched the crowd for her, calling her name, trying to wave above the crowd so that she could see me if she heard me. No response, except for odd glares from the other residents. A panic growing in my chest, I began to make my way towards the apartment complex proper.

As I approached the breezeway where the doors for the first floor, stairwells, and elevators are, I found my path blocked by thick yellow caution tape, with a handwritten sign taped to it that read:

***Gas Leak. No Entry, Per Mgmnt. Alternative accommodations available at leasing office.***

I asked a few of the residents I was more familiar with if they had seen Abby, but, as to be expected, since Abby never left the apartment, they didn't even know that I *had* a roommate. The only person who knew was the leasing manager, Mr. Wilkins, whom I had told about Abby when I asked if I had to add her to my lease; he said at the time that it wouldn't raise the rent, and he didn't feel like filing the paperwork, so as long as she didn't cause any trouble we would be fine to stay together in the apartment. I found him standing at the other end of the yellow tape, near the leasing office, tapping his foot.

""Good evening, Mr. Wilkins. Is everything okay?"" I asked, starting a conversation that I hoped I could steer in the direction of asking if he had seen Abby.

He turned to me, and I could immediately tell that everything was *not* okay. Mr. Wilkins was an older gentleman, and years of alcoholism and sun exposure had given his cheeks a pinkish hue, but tonight, in the pale glow of the streetlights, he appeared sheet white.

""E...evening, James, I'm sorry. You can't g...go in right now... major gas leak on the 2nd floor, whole building has been evacuated for the night."" He croaked, an obvious shake to his voice that a gas leak simply didn't justify. We had major gas leaks a few times a year due to the poor infrastructure of the building, and had to evacuate, but he was usually red-faced and yelling for residents to clear the building so it could be fixed. Something was off.

""That's the floor I live on, room 213. Have you seen Abby?"" I asked, trying to mask the dread in my voice.

""A...abby? I don't know any Abby that lives here."" He said, eyeing me with a look halfway between terror and tears.

""You know... my roommate that..."" I tried to refresh his memory, but was cut off by him pulling me into the leasing office quickly, locking the door, and shutting all the blinds.

""For your sake and mine, J..James, you don't know an Abby and you never did. That... that *thing*... it isn't human."" He said, pulling a chair up for me to sit and shakingly pouring himself a cup of coffee. ""L..look, I'm going to come clean with you, James, the reason I didn't want to add... Abby,"" he said her name very carefully, likely because he had noticed my reaction to him calling her a ""thing"" earlier. ""To your lease, is because you don't *have* a lease on file. I've been pocketing your rent since you started living here...""

I scoffed and gave him a look of disgust, ""You!"" I glared at him, mostly for calling Abby a ""thing,""  but he shushed me and waved his arms down in a ""Keep quiet"" gesture.

""James, I know what I did was wrong, but this can very well benefit both of us if you just listen."" He continued.

""I want to know where she is!"" I said as loud as I could without breaking a whisper.

""James, it..."" he started, but stopped and collected himself when he saw me wince at his last word, ""She. She's gone, James, and she left three dead men in her wake. There's no gas leak, there never was. They're cleaning up the entire floor right now. It's a bloodbath up there."" He finished, looking me in my eyes.

I couldn't believe what he was telling me. Abby, \*my\* Abby, was far too innocent to hurt a fly, much less \*kill\* three men. ""You're lying! She would never..."" I accused.

""I erased all camera footage of your floor as soon as I saw the first of those vans arrive. It was gray, instead of black, and had the IRS seal on it."" He said, gesturing towards the door, the hum of the engines still running was audible in that general direction. ""I thought it was an auditor, here to cook my goose for embezzlement."" He said shamefully, glancing down at the floor for a moment before looking up, with renewed vigor in his eyes. ""Is there *anything* in that room that could be used to identify you?"" He finished his thought.

For a moment, I thought hard about anything that could possibly tie me to the room. There was my laptop, but I had fully given it to Abby almost a year before, and she had wiped the disk to download more games and movies around the same time, so I doubted that it would tie me to the room. The TV wasn't logged in to anything that could give away my identity either (I couldn't afford streaming platforms, so I never bothered making accounts for them). And any important documents were either in my wallet or two states away, back home in mama's little fireproof safe.

""No, but Abby..."" I pleaded, but Mr. Wilkins cut me off again.

""God dammit, James, look!"" He said, tears beginning to stream out of the corners of his eyes, as he turned the monitor to me with a camera feed showing a familiar hallway. ""I erased everything up to the point that the first van arrived, but it has been recording since then. I have to wipe this when the ones in there cleaning up leave or... oh God I don't know what they'll do to me if I don't... just look!""

He pressed the play button, and three figures jumped to the center of the hallway, all wearing black tactical gear with triangular insignias over the left breast pocket, and all waiving small silver batons at the walls and floor. The once relatively clean eggshell-colored walls were now splattered in blood and viscera, which the two men in front were easily cleaning up with a wave of their batons, viscera turning to dust and falling to the floor. The man following up the rear was using a vacuum to suck up the dust.

""Listen. I don't know who these guys are, but they are not affiliated with whoever showed up in the IRS van."" Mr. Wilkins explained softly.

He rewinded the feed to the beginning of the recording, right after he had allegedly cleared it, then fast-forwarded about ten minutes. In those ten minutes that sped by in seconds, I could see Mr. Wilkins knocking on each door in the hallway- each door except mine and Abby's- and ushering the occupants out of their rooms. Mr. Wilkins paused the feed.

""They specifically told me not to alert the occupants of room 213, should any be there."" Mr. Wilkins said, answering the question before my lips could form it. ""Like I said, I thought my goose was cooked. I was going to claim you two were squatters, have a buddy of mine from the sheriff's department come 'evict' you, then have you both come back and sign a *proper* lease to cover all of our asses should those goons have came back.""

He skipped ahead a few minutes, and three men, dressed in suits and ties, with the man in front carrying a briefcase, were shown stepping off the elevator and making their way to the center of the hallway. Mr. Wilkins clicked the speaker icon on the bottom right of the screen, and static, followed by voices, crackled through the computer's speakers.

""Building secure?"" The lead man asked the one behind him and to his right.

""Building secure, sir. Target is presumed in room 213. The manager assured me that the target is unaware of our arrival and presence on the premises. Paperwork shows that the room is not leased out to anyone, on account of unrepairable water issues. The entity has likely been using the room as a place to lure in victims. No camera evidence of this, though. Manager states there's an issue with the camera system, and this floor's camera loses data often.""

""Could be chalked up to the entity's influence on electronics... but make note of that interaction for debriefing."" The man with the briefcase responded.

""What exactly are we up against here, boss?"" Asked the man who had yet to speak. The lead man looked at him and set down his briefcase, opening it and pulling out what appeared to be a long black flashlight, like the kind that police officers shine in your window if you get pulled over at night.

""A Daimon-class entity escaped when the freezer truck carrying a few of them broke down a state over. Probably about a year and a half ago at this point, give or take a few months. The entity's inverted field signature has been traced back to this location, and local field oscillations suggest it has had a steady supply of energy to feed off of."" The lead man replied, testing the balance of the flashlight-like object in his hand.

""Subject will appear as female, roughly mid-20s. Daimon-class entities are not known to be able to alter their body plans to the extent of the more common Wolf-class entities you're used to, but don't be fooled. They can exert some control over Field-positive individuals even with brief skin contact."" He looked from one man to the other and continued speaking.  ""You two are Field negative, so the entity won't have any anomalous effect on you even if it touches you. I'm Field-positive, so I'll support from a safe distance, but if the readings are to be believed, don't expect this thing to go down without a fight. Take these."" He finished, handing each of the other men one of the flashlight-like objects.

""Field dampeners,"" he said, gesturing to the flashlights, ""They detect Field inversions and cancel them out with a parallel wave. If a Daimon-class is Superman, these are Kryptonite. Won't work on Wolf-class, since their Field pattern isn't inverted, it'll only piss them off. Point and shoot."" He finished by pointing the object at the wall and pressing the button, which, as would be expected from a regular flashlight, resulted in a beam being projected onto the wall.

I couldn't speak. My eyes were glued to the screen. They were talking about Abby as if she were some kind of monster... Daimon-class... Wolf-class... what could this all mean? She's human-class and, if anything else, angel-class to me. The ball in my stomach continued to tighten as the two men, following the orders of their leader, stationed themselves on each side of the door.

""Ready? Ready?"" The lead asked the two other men, each responding with a nod. ""BREACHING!"" He screamed as he kicked the door twice, then threw a third kick that broke the rickety door frame inwards, after which he retreated to the far corner of the hallway and pulled a large tablet out of the briefcase and began swiping across the screen.

What happened next was pure chaos. The once crystal-clear video feed distorted, showing wave patterns across the entire screen, as if it were a copy of a copy recorded onto a VHS tape. The audio was distorted as well, but I could still make out what was being said.

The lead man jumped up suddenly, and screamed: ""FIELD SPIKE, FIELD SPIKE, WOLF-CLASS SIGNATURE DETECTED... AND CONFIRMED!"" as he looked down at a small tablet in his hand, ""DO NOT ENGAGE, WE ARE NOT EQUIPPED, FALL BA-""

Before the final word could leave his throat, his head was splattered across the wall behind him like an overripe tomato, reduced to nothing but an unrecognizable smear on the wallpaper. A black blur had left the doorway, shattering it even further in the process, and caught him as soon as he turned to run.

It bent down and split itself in half at the torso with a gut-wrenching squelch, spraying black ooze on the surrounding walls and floor. The thing then shoved most of the body of the now headless man into its chest-maw before snapping it shut with a noise that came through the speakers sounding like a tree limb being snapped off in a windstorm. It stood still for a moment, and Mr. Wilkins paused the feed.

I took in the beast's horrible form. A full head taller than the doorway,  jet black, hairless with leathery, wrinkled skin. The head was vaguely dog-shaped, with pointed ears, or horns possibly, on either side, long black teeth protruding from the jaws, continuing down a seam that ran the length of the creature's torso and stopping just above the groin. From just below the groin, two inverted legs, almost like a grasshopper's legs, jutted out and bent at odd angles, culminating in three razor-sharp talons on each foot. Two abominable, twisted appendages ending in fingers the length of a grown man's arm curled down from the demon's lower neck, reaching the floor and holding it upright. Even on the paused feed, the screen continued to distort around the grotesque shape standing in the frame, as if the technology itself was protesting having to bear the burden of showing it.

""Do you see that, James??? There is your Abby! And if that *isn't* Abby, then it has either eaten her or mauled her by now!"" He cried out.

That wasn't my Abby. I have *no* idea what that thing was, but it wasn't my sweet, innocent Abby, who smelled of sugar cookies and had to stand on her tippy toes to reach the top of the fridge.

Mr. Wilkins pressed play.

The monster roared, but the only thing coming through the speakers sounded like pure static. The feed from the camera bounced up and down as the noise resounded. On its back, two black... wings... if you could call them that... exploded out of its shoulder blades and spread across the width of the hallway, looking more like voids than physical structures, then the diabolical being made a move for the other two men. It caught the smaller of the two by the face with those horrendous hands, lifting him off the ground and crushing his skull as if it were a chip bag. His body jerked for a moment, fell still, then was discarded like a used napkin as the brute turned to face his final target. The remaining man was screaming into a cell phone and fumbling in his coat for something while making his way towards the door. He pulled out a silver baton similar to those held by the men in tactical suits currently cleaning up the carnage, only tarnished and worn; the man was fast once his hand had found purchase on the baton, and aimed it at the devilish quadruped with trained precision before pressing a button on the side.

He wasn't quite fast enough.

The camera feed cut out for a split second, and when it came back, both man and beast were flying uncontrollably through the air, bursting through the closed doors to the elevator shaft with a crash. I could vaguely hear the thud and crunch as their bodies bounced once off the wall before landing on top of the elevator, parked back at the first floor.

""That... that *monster* was not my Abby. It couldn't have been! She has to still be in the room hiding, I need to go to her!"" I started as a whisper and ended almost shouting. Mr. Wilkins shushed me again and turned the monitor towards himself briefly, adjusting the slider on the video before turning back to where we could both see it.

""James, just keep watching... nobody is in that room, at least not alive... I watched this all happen on the cameras in real time."" He said as he once again pressed play.

The three figures from before in tactical gear were stepping out of the stairwell just out of view of the camera, and began looking at the scene.

""Jesus, Edwards. To think, we were planning on spending today sipping martinis on a beach in the Bahamas. Great first day of the off-cycle, right?"" The thinner of the three men started, looking at the bulkier man leading to team, ""What the heck even happened here? We didn't have time for a briefing before they threw us in a van..."" The same man finished.

""According to Elliot, some goons working for a group of interest called... Hecate? Holcomb? Something starting with an 'H'... well, anyway, our mole embedded in the group, which is currently missing in action at this location, reported that they were homing in on what they call a 'Daimon-class' entity, which we would normally call an 'augmented.' Specifically, one that we ourselves were tracking but had no intentions of dealing with since it wasn't hurting nobody, and is more of a hassle to deal with than it's worth. When they got here, it turned out to be what they call a 'Wolf-class' instead."" The man named Edwards explained.

""Yeah, okay, makes sense and all, but what the heck do *we* call that they call a 'Wolf Class' then, boss? And you mean to tell me they let people like that Pigg guy just run around free, even if they knows where to find'em?"" The thin man asked.

The third man in the group answered for the lead in a thick accent that almost reminded me of the Nords from Skyrim: ""We call them CE Type-Bs, Thatcher. And yes, this augmented has a track record of being docile. We lost track of it in North Macedonia, where it was presumed captured and transported here."" The Nord said matter-of-factly. ""We recently picked up on the inverted Field signal again, but, as Team Lead Edwards was saying, the entity poses no threat, and additionally passes as human well enough to not break the veil.""

I didn't know any of these guys, but they must be talking about my Abby. Too many things lined up. Macedonia, captured and transported, and now that I had heard the word a few times, I even recognized the word ""Daimon"" from some of the stories Abby would tell me. This was my Abby, and hearing them call her an ""it"" and an ""entity"" so many times was beginning to make my blood boil. She. She. How hard is it?

Mr. Wilkins must have sensed my anger growing, as he paused the video and put a hand on my shoulder. ""I don't understand any of what they're talking about, kid, but it sounds like they're referring to your roommate like a monster. I can only put two and two together, you know? And you saw the same thing I did on that screen..."" He said in an almost comforting tone.

""Just play the damn video, I want to see what else they have to say,"" I said, my temper flaring to a fever pitch.

He obliged.

""This whole situation is very unusual, though. It is not unheard of for an augmented to lose control of themselves to NCEs and be taken over as Type-B hosts... but this augmented was particularly powerful, and, if we are to believe the dossier, well over *2000* years old. I suspect there is more to this than simply 'losing control'.""

Powerful? *2000* years old? There's no way they could be talking about her... it doesn't make any sense... I mean, yeah, she's *strong* for her size, even lifting me off my feet in some of our fits of passion, but this guy looks like he lifts fridges for fun, and he's referring to her power with almost a kind of... reverence...

""Uh-huh. Glad you guys gots access to this type of shit. Could really come in handy for the rest of us peons, though."" The man named Thatcher quipped.

""Whatever the case, we are here to locate the Type-B and the mole, dead or alive, and clean this place up. It is actively inhabited. Just get rid of the gore and bodies, cleaners will be by in the morning to patch up the brickwork, and it'll be like it *never happened*,"" the Team Lead said, rubbing his hands together at the last two words as if he were cleaning them of the whole situation.

""***Never happened?!***"" I can't just pretend like this never happened! My. Girl. Friend. Is. Miss. Ing."" I said aloud to myself. The coffee had seemingly calmed Mr. Wilkins' nerves, and he looked at me with pity.

I didn't need pity... I needed Abby...

The video had been playing in the background, mostly just the men walking around looking at bodies and organs splattered across various surfaces. Then one of them spoke.

""Hey, boss, uh, you're gonna wanna see this,"" Thatcher said, leaning slightly over the threshold and looking down into the elevator shaft.

""Well, looks like we found our Type B,"" Edwards said.

""Looks like he whacked our mole, too."" Thatcher joked, kicking a blob of flesh down into the elevator shaft.

""Must have voided the entity right before it hit him."" The Nord observed.

The rest of the video was uneventful. The leader gave orders, the New Yorker quipped and made jokes, and the Nord gave seemingly standard textbook answers to whatever stupid questions the other two had. They went in and out of my room with no mention of Abby. I longed for her, wherever she was.

That night, I took Mr. Wilkins' offer of staying silent, his offer of a free hotel room for the night, and his offer of waiving this month's rent. My heart ached already for Abby, and I could feel the void growing in my chest even though it had been less than 12 hours since the last time I had seen her.

I went to the police the next morning, hoping beyond hope that she had been picked up wandering the streets or taken there by a concerned bystander. I even tried to file a missing person's report, but the officer behind the desk called me crazy for what I had told him. I heard the shredder cycle as I walked towards the exit, my tear-stained cheeks moistening again with fresh tears.

By the time I made it home, the apartment was back open. My room was the same, aside from a lingering cold in my bedroom that refused to pass, a freshly installed door, and some slightly off-colored paint around where the wall had been repaired. And of course, no Abby. I searched for the locket she had given me that whole day, and sporadically every day afterwards, leading up to today.

\---

Back to the events of today. My manager, Anthony, called me at around noon and asked me if I would be able to work my shift this evening. I told him there would be no way, and explained that my girlfriend was missing and I hadn't been able to eat or sleep for several days because of it. His tone grew slightly suspicious through the phone, and he asked if I could at least come in and fill out some HR paperwork to make sure I kept my job.

I obliged, if only out of respect for Anthony. I had no intention of ever going back to work. I showed up in front of his office at a quarter past two. I hadn't showered, shaved, or even bothered to comb my hair or brush my teeth.

""Come in, James. Close the door behind you and have a seat, my friend."" He said in his usual customer service voice. As soon as I sat down, his demeanor changed entirely to one of something close to excitement. ""So, your Daimon girlfriend disappeared on you, huh?""

My blood froze in my veins as the words crossed his lips. Daimon. The same thing those guys at the apartment had called her.

""Where did you hear that word?"" I asked, my voice catching in my throat at every syllable.

""James, I'm not going to lie to you, my man. When you started coming to work a while back, looking like you'd just crawled away from a fight with a tiger, and hadn't slept since birth to boot, I thought those boys back in shipping had sold you something too strong for you!"" He chuckled.

""What do you..."" I couldn't even finish my question before he continued.

""Then, when you started calling in every day since last Saturday, I thought the drugs had gotten to you. I was just about to let you go! Even cleaned out your locker myself. Recognize this?"" He said, pulling a folded-up towel out of a drawer in his desk and passing it to me.

I felt the heat emanating from it before he even handed it to me. I knew what it was. I held the prized possession close to my chest without unwrapping it, feeling the warmth begin to thaw my aching heart and bring some semblance of hope back into my life that I would see Abby again.

""You don't even know what that is, do you, friend? You think it's just some lover's trinket? A momento?"" He said, his smile wide and genuine. ""That you hold in your hand there is what is known as a phylactery. Go ahead! I'm sure your little girly told you what to do with it. I'd hate to ruin the surprise!""

I unwrapped the locket. The heat of the metal against my bare hand reminded me so much of Abby's touch, the agonizing delight that had been absent from my life for what felt to my soul like an eternity past, but that I knew in my mind had only been a week.

Anthony ushered me along almost impatiently with a sweeping movement from both of his hands.

I held it firmly in my hands, my heart thrumming to the tune of what I thought to be the watch inside. I ran my finger up the curve of the lid, the smooth fire burning my fingertips and reminding me at once of my first night in bed with Abby, how *her* skin burned a maddening pleasure into my hand as I ran it up the curve of her side.

I found the button at the apex of the lid, just opposite where the chain connected. I moved my thumb gently around the contour of the button a few times in a circular motion, savoring the sweltering satisfaction and confirming to myself what would be inside. I brought the silver implement close to my face and kissed the smooth plate of the back of it. The warmth at once flooded my body and mind, melting away the last of my inhibitions.

I pressed the button.

The lid fell open.

A familiar smell filled the room, a familiar heat burned across my entire body,  and a familiar voice filled my ears.

I plan to graduate high school, then go to college. I might study abroad in Ireland (I've done research on colleges there in my free time) but if I can't/change my mind, I'll probably go to one of the colleges in my state that my dad and brother went to.

After college, it gets kind of rocky. Right now, I'm thinking of getting an apartment in the USA, then saving up enough money to move to Ireland over a few years. I think you can purchase a home or apartment in Ireland overseas, so I'll probably do that before actually getting to the country.

I'll probably have a temporary job at a library or coffee shop (the library closest to me has both of those combined, two things I love) in the USA, then when I move to Ireland, I'll become a doctor or maybe get an art degree. I'm squeamish right now, but I'm trying to get over it by watching medical videos.

In Ireland, I plan to live in Cork. I've started saving money to move out (currently have $268.50 in my savings) either for an apartment or for moving countries. Like I said, I'll hopefully become a doctor. I don't plan to have kids, but maybe I'll get married.

A hope I have is that I'll date somebody before I move countries who also wants to move to Ireland, so I won't be alone while traveling since I know traveling alone isnt very safe, and I'm also paranoid and anxious.

1oyb5an,https://www.reddit.com/r/TotalHipReplacement/comments/1oyb5an/my_7_days_after_left_anterior_thr_f52/,My 7 days after left anterior THR - F(52),"Hi folks, thought I'd add my experience to other people's stories. I've really benefitted from reading about others on this sub so would like to contribute to the pool. I had a spinal and sedative. I came home yesterday on day 6.

Please be warned if you're waiting for surgery and are anxious, my experience might not be super helpful. However I was glad to have stories like this to prepare me to be mentally strong for recovery. 

So my story started with groin, lower back, and hip pain for years. I decided to look into it as I was sure something must be up. I now know I have issues with interoception (can't tell clearly what my body is feeling) and can see I've exercised through the wrong type of pain in the past, whether that be opening my hips in Iyengar yoga, doing full body lifts at the gym, or groin pain with cycling. I was diagnosed autistic at 50 and I'm sure this has saved my life. But that's a story for another sub. Also I'm peri-menopausal. 

I had OA and labral degeneration in my left hip. Was told I'd need a replacement at some point and it was up to me when depending on when the tipping point came. I was on celebrex (100 then 200mg) a day and lyrica 75mg twice a day for the pain. More recently topped up with paracetamol as needed. I saw a rheumatologist who confirmed no RA. I am a lifelong cyclist, nothing fancy, just commuting 100+km a week and riding for social reasons. Switched to riding just my ebike 12 months before the op, when I got the news from the surgeon and realised cycling was the cause of my groin pain. I since had two steroid injections into the joint. I got private health at the second highest level to cover joint replacements and worked overtime for a year to pay for it. The surgeon referred me to an amazing physio (so many shit physios in my life but now I will never have another) and I did prehab for a year, adjusting the exercises as my tolerance lowered and pain increased. I put on weight as I was doing less cardio by not riding my regular bike, just the ebike, and I got depressed generally with the stasis of my life waiting for the op. I couldn't go hiking because it caused too much pain and that affected my mental health too. 

For surgery recovery I bought all the things I thought I'd need, as advised by this sub. I live with my partner and our labrador and cat in a ground level 2bdr unit in Melbourne AU. This is my second day home and I'm so happy to be out of the hospital. It was rough. 

I had low blood pressure and extreme nausea after surgery. The surgery itself went very well according to the surgeon. So for two days I was in hell. I'm not going to lie, it was awful. It's so weird to walk into a hospital then wake up after surgery with what feels like an xmas ham sewn to your body that is a dead weight. A nurse told me that three other patients who'd had the same anesthetist that day also had nausea. The blood pressure is more unique to me. My BP is generally very good, but I must have a post surgery reaction. I had this with several endometriosis surgeries too. So I had fluids and antibiotics for the first two days. I was so uncomfortable and was feeling pain like I'd' never felt before (worse than the endo I had which was pretty severe). I forced myself to eat a tiny amount, mostly yogurt, and threw up a lot of the water I drank. 

I was on endone, paracetamol and palexia, often having paracetamol together with either of those, and I am still on that mix now I'm at home. I'd like to wean myself off as soon as I can manage, by doing the spacing out technique, but I'm not ready for that. 

Using a bedpan as a woman is pretty horrific at times depending on the nurses you have working with you. You have to be able to lift your butt enough to get the pan under. I found out the regular pan, and not the slip in pan with the thin. sharp edge, which is often used for older women who have less strength, was the more comfortable option for me. The first time I got wheeled to the toilet and could sit up and use toilet paper was such a milestone. I'd felt so terrible with the low blood pressure and nausea that I really feel it set me back a bit, but now I'm on track. Also having to wee like this means it gets on your gown and bed. It doesn't make you feel good, so ask for a fresh gown and bed change if this happens to you. 

I was injected in the stomach for three days with a blood thinner, and now I'm on tablets. I was woken up regularly for observations. I had a bit of a temperature also for the first four days, so combined with the BP and nausea, I felt very bad. 

When I could start to eat again my blood pressure improved, and as my body passed the sedative drugs, I could see a way through. Trying to move my leg felt so futile, like trying to move a brick with a blade of grass. I had to push through the excruciating pain to activate a response in my muscles, and this has paid off. But I'm not pulling punches, it was the hardest thing I've done in my life (I have not had children). So now I'm doing the exercises four times a day and am on crutches which I can use easily. I'll have home physio start next week. 

I get suddenly exhausted but then can't sleep. I am having movicol and coloxyl for the bowel, and now drinking some coffee and taking psyllium husk daily to help with this. I had to have an enema in hospital on day five which was intense but it worked. No poop yet today but I'm still hoping...

So it's a bit grose but I hope it helps someone feel more informed. I know I'll be glad I did it when I'm a bit further along in the recovery. For now I'm still dealing with the post op trauma. I'm not a weak person mentally or physically. I think this experience will only make me stronger and hopefully, ultimately, happier.

The first time I had only seen her at a meeting and we didn’t speak, the second time we spoke to each other just a little bit, and the third time was at a training event where we did have a few conversations (it was a 5-6 hour event). At the end of the event, I asked if she was free the following weekend. She said she thinks she might be but wasn’t sure and asked why. I followed up by saying I wanted to see if she’d want to go on a coffee date on Saturday. She said she’s pretty sure she’s busy, and that was that. This was maybe 2 weeks ago now?

So Wednesday I see her at the weekly meeting we do and all is well, didn’t really speak much but I lead the meeting so my presence was there you know. Later after the meeting, she posted on a discord channel asking for input on a graphic she was making. I messaged her on signal and gave her some information, and we started going back and forth about that, then some ideas for the groups Instagram, the the history of the group and how she’s impressed by us, then political stuff, then about running for office, which brought up our ages and how my birthday just passed and hers is coming up, and that we’re really close in age, etc.

Obviously not much has happened here, but we’ve been talking back and forth over three days now and it’s been fun and is slowly getting more personal. When I asked her out and she politely said no, I thought about how I should’ve mentioned maybe a different time, but figured she would’ve if she was interested anyways. My wonder is if things continue on like this for a while and the conversations become more personal and frequent, can/should I ask her out again at some point, or was that my one chance and I should just wait for her initiation if anything does happen?",1,1763263383.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

the wardrobe door is broken so its a pain to open and close to get our clothes in so we just lay our jackets on the chair, the ironing board iron is missing the knob so we just had to pray it wasnt too hot luckily it was just warm enough to get the job done, the hairdryer decided to dry up cuz we couldn't get it to work and the noise coming from the balcony is so loud i was almost sure it was coming from the walls that i thought i was going insane, turns out its the vents, who designed ts,

and then to wrap up the experience we were going down for breakfast and my aunt already told the attendant beforehand that we'd be paying for 2 more people and he looks at me like i killed him in his past life telling me our room already had used up the complimentary 2 slots for the breakfast, we told him we'd be paying for it in our checkout bill yet he didnt understand, told him over and over and he insisted that we cant go in there, i called my aunt to come and Karensplain it to him and she told the guy the same thing and he switched up his attitude then let us in so i loudly and audibly uttered ""Dogshit service"" and they replied by spilling coffee next to our table and never cleaned it,

my aunt said the chicken taste divine, it must've been so divine that it flew to heaven because they didnt restock it until im already eating the cereal, the bill was apparently $10 per person, like for what? all they had was noodles and chicken and the chicken was so divine we cant even see the light from it otherwise we'd be blinded as the prophecy said, the cereal was probably the most expensive thing there, I paid for fking coco crunch

The only thing I could say was a good experience was the toilet, just like this 2 out of 5 hotel, I was shitting good on it

1oyb3tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1oyb3tv/tips_how_to_hijack_social_proof_and_make_yourself/,[Tips] How to hijack social proof and make yourself look 10x bigger (without faking anything),"We live in a credibility economy. Online, most people won’t judge you based on your skills, experience, or IQ — they’ll judge you based on *perceived* authority. I’ve seen this over and over again in San Francisco hustle culture, online education startups, and even academia. The people who LOOK like experts get more trust, followers, deals, and money — even if they’re mid in real life.

This post is a deep dive into how to ethically hijack social proof — based on actual behavioral science, not TikTok charisma hacks. I wrote this because I’ve seen so much cringe advice floating around like “fake it till you make it” or “just act confident.” Nah. That doesn’t work anymore. This is about building perceived authority in a *systematic way* without lying or looking desperate. Most of these tips are from behavioral economics research, branding psychology, and some savage marketing tactics used by top creators and entrepreneurs.

1. **Borrow authority from bigger platforms**

People trust you more when they see you associated with names they recognize. There’s a reason why even mid-tier influencers slap “As seen in Forbes” on their bio (even if they just got quoted in a roundup post). The trick is to get *micro-features* on mid-to-high authority platforms. You can start with:
- Submitting expert quotes to sites like HARO (Help a Reporter Out)
- Writing guest posts for niche blogs or newsletters with decent readership
- Collaborating with micro-creators in your field

This works because of the “halo effect.” If people see your name next to trusted brands, their brain automatically upgrades your status. Daniel Kahneman talks about this bias in *Thinking, Fast and Slow* — the brain takes shortcuts when assessing credibility. Use that.

2. **Create social stacking on your profiles**

Go look at the LinkedIn bios of people who seem big online. Notice something? Their bio reads like a brag sandwich. First, a bold claim (“Helping startups scale to $10M+”), then logos (“featured in TechCrunch, YC alum”), then numbers (“40k+ newsletter subs”).

You don’t need all three to start. But pick *one* and double down. If you don’t have big numbers yet, flex your client wins, transformations, or insider knowledge. For example:
- “Led hiring for 4 unicorn companies”
- “Built 3 viral campaigns reaching 2M+ views”
- “Trusted by 100+ DTC founders”

Perception is created through *structure*, not just scale.

3. **Use content as a credibility delivery mechanism**

One of the fastest ways to hijack social proof is to create content that *looks* like it was made by someone 10x bigger than you actually are. This doesn’t mean pretending. It means using:
- Professionally branded content templates
- Speaking in frameworks or step-by-step methods
- Referencing cutting-edge studies or books

This is where YouTube and podcasting come in. People associate production value and thoughtful content with authority. Naval Ravikant said on *The Tim Ferriss Show* that “if you want to be taken seriously, learn to speak in terms that scale.” That means tweets, essays, podcasts, or videos that sound like they belong in a masterclass, not a coffee chat.

4. **Frame your work in terms of outcomes, not activity**

This is straight from the startup world. Founders are obsessed with “outcomes” because it signals leverage. Instead of saying “I post marketing tips,” say “I help creators 5x their funnel conversions using psychology-backed content.” Same activity, but framed like a growth weapon.

In *$100M Offers* by Alex Hormozi, he explains how perceived value explodes when you tie your work to results, especially results that people can visualize or desire (money, time, power, status).

5. **Hijack borrowed status through books and experts**

This is underrated. People respect thinkers who reference other respected thinkers. It’s social proof by association. But don’t just name-drop books. Break them down and link them to what you do.

Examples:
- “According to Cialdini’s *Influence*, authority is one of the 6 key levers of persuasion. That’s why I always include credentials in my landing page headers.”
- “Morgan Housel’s book *The Psychology of Money* explains why we trust people who speak in counterintuitive truths. That’s how you frame disruptive products.”

Reading deep cuts and quoting them naturally makes people assume you’re in the top 1% of your field. Use it.

6. **Try to make learning addictive**

Building your authority means you need to learn fast but also speak fluently in your field’s language. Two apps I use:



- **Fathom** – For podcast listeners. It automatically highlights and bookmarks smart quotes from podcasts. Helps when building swipe files of expert arguments or industry insight.

-  **BeFreed** – This one goes even deeper. BeFreed is an AI-powered learning engine that personalizes your self-education journey. It builds a study plan based on your interests, then turns expert books, research, and interviews into podcast-style content. You can even choose the voice of your host and adjust how deep you want to go — from 10 to 40 mins.

The coolest part? It adapts to your learning habits. The more you listen, the smarter it gets. It builds your custom roadmap and updates it weekly based on your goals. All the book recs I’ve listed are in its library. If you replace 10 minutes of doomscrolling with this, you’ll build massive compound knowledge in 6 months. Easy 1% daily self-improvement.

7. **Read books that level up your positioning game**

1. *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion* by Robert Cialdini  
This is the god-tier classic every builder, creator, marketer, and founder needs to read. Cialdini breaks down six principles that drive how humans make decisions, and **authority** is one of the most powerful. This book will make you rethink how people perceive success and expertise. NYT bestseller, recommended by almost every top marketer. Still hits in 2024.

2. *Perennial Seller* by Ryan Holiday  
Ever wonder why some people’s work lasts forever while others fade? Holiday breaks down what makes ideas timeless. This book changed how I think about reputation and positioning. Best book I’ve read on how to build legacy, not just temporary hype.

3. *Building a StoryBrand* by Donald Miller  
If you want to make your personal brand feel 10x bigger, this book teaches you how to make yourself the “guide” not the hero. It’s the strategy Hollywood and Fortune 500 brands use. Super actionable, insanely good read. Especially if you're a freelancer, solo founder, or creator.

4. *$100M Offers* by Alex Hormozi  
This one will slap you in the face — in a good way. Hormozi doesn’t waste time. He shows you how to create offers and positioning that make you *too good to ignore*. This isn’t a mindset book, it’s a weapon.

5. *The Status Game* by Will Storr  
This one hit different. It explains the hidden rules that shape how people assign status — from Twitter threads to dinner parties. It made me realize how much of “authority” today is just performance. This book will make you question everything you think you know about success. A must-read.

There’s no shame in shaping perception — it’s how the game works. Safe to say, being good isn’t enough anymore. You need to *look* good, too. And when done right, perception becomes reality.

Let me know if you want a part two on how to boost status in your actual conversations. This stuff is deeper than most people think.",3,1763263290.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

I really need to vent somewhere, anywhere, everything that I've been thinking lately, I don't need advices etc, but if you want, please feel free to! I think the text is going to be too long :/   ( English ain't my first language so I apologize in advance )

i'm always changing days of my suicide because something always happens, if i leave this world, I want to leave without commitment.

what I mean is that if I kms now, it's going to be a burden for my family right now because we're low on money...we've always been, but right now we can't even afford food properly, and next month is my friend birthday ( last birthday of the year ), she talks so excited about her birthday to the point I feel guilty about thinking ending it all before I could see her turn 19 too

I've been thinking about running away from home, go really far away to end it all so no one can find me and don't worry seeing me gone that way.

i already treat with psychiatric, take meds and do therapy, but it seems like nothing changes, and what worsens everything more is that i have a 90% chance of having borderline, I've never been normal and I never will it appears...I feel like I disappear, everything and everyone will get better

I can't find a job till February because my mom was fired ( 4 years into the job ) and is receiving that thing that the job pays when you're just normally fired.
PLUS the other reason is that my brother passed an important exam some months ago and is currently into an university, so, if I find a good job my mom stops receiving the money and would probably need to work again too, and PLUS AGAIN!!! if I start working and my mom or brother starts too, we need to find a job with a little low payment, because what I understood is that if the family receives X amount of money, they kick you out of the university because the family receives a "" good amount "", so fuck all the exam apparently...

I'm always seeing people that made me miserable win in their life, I'm always running after my things trying to at least survive, and most of them receive their things hands kissed...jobs, cars, money, food, clothes

if someone read all that will probably think that famous phrase "" you're still young, you have a lot to live "" and blablabla, but to be fair, I don't think my life will ever get at least good, my whole body is already done because I self-harm since I was 10, family is kinda shit and crazy, I feel alone all the time because I don't and can't have a real, true and healthy relationship with anyone, being that a friend or a lover

I just wanted to be true loved, caressed, cared for who I truly am

i'll see if I wait till the end of the year and do something, or wait the new year pass to do the thing...anyways, coffee with hello kitty biscuits",4,1763263175.0,depressionmeals,0,1.0,False

We’re heading to Japan and spending our first few days in Kyoto. Just wanted a sanity check on our itinerary — does this feel realistic or too much?

Sunday:
Arrive in Tokyo around 5 PM, take the Shinkansen straight to Kyoto, check in, quick dinner, sleep.

Monday:
Tea ceremony from 11–1 in Higashiyama. After that, planning to head to Nishiki Market for food/snacks, then walk through Ninenzaka/Sannenzaka, Yasaka Pagoda, and up to Kiyomizu-dera for sunset. Dinner in Gion or Pontocho.

Tuesday:
Morning at Fushimi Inari (just the first part of the hike), then train to Uji for the afternoon — Byodoin Temple, Uji River walk, matcha tasting, and matcha soba lunch. Back to Kyoto for a relaxed dinner and evening.

Wednesday:
Easy morning (thinking Philosopher’s Path, Tofuku-ji, or just coffee/river walk), then catch the Shinkansen to Hiroshima around 11:30–12 PM.

1oyax4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/1oyax4z/f4m_19f/,f4m [19F],"Okay, so I swear I wasn’t trying to be a tease today. I woke up fully intending to be productive, drink my coffee like a responsible adult, and mind my business. But you know how the universe loves throwing a little chaos into the mix? Yeah… that happened the moment I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror.

I wasn’t even wearing anything dramatic. Just something simple, something comfy, something that definitely shouldn’t have made me stop in my tracks the way it did. But the light hit a little too perfectly, the fabric sat a little too right, and suddenly I was staring at myself thinking, “Wait… since when do I look like *that*?”

You ever have those rare moments where your confidence sneaks up on you out of nowhere? Like you suddenly catch your own energy and it surprises you a little? That’s exactly what happened. I tilted my head, shifted my weight, and the next thing I know, I’m taking a few photos.not even trying, just playing with angles, laughing at myself, and realizing maybe I don’t look as tired as I thought I did. Maybe I even look a little… distracting.

Then I checked the previews. And oh my god. One of them had this perfect mix of soft, messy, cute, and dangerous. The kind of photo that makes you wonder if it’s too much to post or not enough. The kind that sits in your gallery asking, “Are you really going to keep me private? Really?”

So here we are. I caved. Completely. This one felt too good not to share. Not because I’m trying to show off, but because sometimes you hit that tiny spark of confidence and it feels wrong not to let it breathe. Plus… maybe someone out there needs a little distraction today. Maybe you deserve a small “wow” moment in the middle of your scrolling.

I’ll be honest… part of me is nervous posting this. Reddit can be unpredictable, and I swear these filters are allergic to anything even slightly fun. So if this goes down, well… at least a few of you got to see it before it vanished into mod limbo.

But if it stays up? Then maybe I’ll let myself be a little bolder next time. Maybe I’ll share the other angle the one that almost made *me* blush. Or maybe I’ll save it for a rainy day when I need a reminder that I can look like trouble without even trying.

Anyway, if you made it this far, thanks for reading my mini ramble. I hope this post gives you the same little spark it gave me. And if you like it… maybe let me know. I might just use that as an excuse to post again sooner than planned.

For now, here’s the moment that ruined my productivity and made me hit “upload.” Be gentle. Or don’t. I can handle both.",2,1763262734.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False

As a freelancer, I spend most days working from home, and sometimes it seriously drains my creativity. I found myself hopping between coffee shops just to stay inspired and realized I didn’t really have a good way to keep track of great spots.

So I built one.

Introducing CafeGuidePH — a directory of coffee shops around Metro Manila. The first version is built using publicly available data, but my goal is to turn it into a community-driven platform where people can submit cafés, leave thoughts, and help others discover awesome places to work or hang out.

Just launched it today with a short demo video. If you have feedback or feature ideas, drop them in. I’d love to hear what you think.

1oyawfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1oyawfv/my_story_20_year_long_lo/,My Story - 20 Year Long LO,"Hi all. I've been commenting here a bit over the last few days, but I realise I haven't yet shared my story, so here it is. I'll try not to ramble (but I probably will as there's so much). I'll likely miss a lot of details, but this will cover the main points hopefully:

\-----------------------------------------------------

Long before meeting my long-term LO, I had always found that I would be the type of person who will fall in love at first sight. More often than not I didn't have the confidence to actually speak to any of my LO's (being a child) and instead preferred to tell friends about how I felt, knowing they would pass it on (as kids do) which I always found really exciting, wanting to know how they reacted etc. I lacked a lot of confidence as a kid, it's always been something I've struggled with even to this day in some regards.

Prior to meeting my LO, I would have been in my first year of high school (age 11-12) and I'd met a girl (we'll call her Dana) who I immediately fell in love with at first sight. We shared some lessons together and for the first time in my life, she actually enjoyed chatting to me. This was my first LO I ever had real contact with. Each day I was excited to go to school to talk to her, and when I wasn't at school I would sit at my computer with MSN open waiting for her to come online to talk more. I was completely obsessed with her and remembered every last detail that we spoke about, spending hours thinking of the best ways to start conversation. We used to hug and compliment each other. My mates at the time used to mock her (for something I won't go into here) so I ditched all my friends and hung out with her and her friends during breaks. Things were better than ever. Then, one day I arrived at school and saw Dana, so I walked over and said hello, but she completely blanked me. It turned out she had an older boyfriend who told her to ignore me, so she did. It absolutely ruined me! I recovered the friendship with my old mates I'd distanced myself from, but this all happened as a new school year was about to begin.

A new school year meant new people in new classes. This would be when I met my long-term LO in a funny yet awkward encounter. I walked into my new English lesson, early and ahead of all my friends. I was quite exited because this class consisted of essentially all my mates in the same class, so it was guaranteed to be a laugh. I picked a row of seats towards the back of the class and sat on the chair next to the wall. There was another row of seats in front which I expected my mates to sit on. Now you need to understand, me and my mates were pretty savage in terms of pranks, not for the faint of heart. I picked a drawing-pin off the poster next to me, and put it on the chair in front, giggling as I waited for one of my mates to sit on it (they did the same kind of thing to me too). But before they entered, a group of girls walked in and decided to sit on that row! ""Ohh crap"" I thought! Worse yet, one of the girls (we'll call her Ellanor) struck my eye, she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen in my life and I immediately fell head-over-heels in love in that second. She walked along and went to sit in front of me, on the chair with the pin... I tried to say ""not that one!"" but couldn't get the words out. Luckily she noticed. She turned around and said ""who the fuck was this, was it you!?"" looking at me. Red in the face, feeling absolutely mortified, I said ""yes""... She laughed and thought it was funny. What are the chances? This is my long-term LO, this is Ellanor. As a side note, my last LO Dana was also sitting in the same row with Ellanor, but we'll come back to that.

Ellanor was confident and outgoing, she would turn around to chat to me and my mates all the time and had a savage sense of humor which rivaled even the worst of my mates, genuinely hilarious. She had no filter and used to ask the kinds of inappropriate questions every teenager is wondering but is too afraid to actually ask. She would also draw a lot, and ask for my thoughts on her pictures. We actually started to become quite close, and the teacher would often tell us off for talking too much during class. On one occasion, I pleaded with the teacher into giving me an hour-long after school detention (a worse punishment) instead of just separating us, anything was better than that. Basically I was now deeply in love, and she seemed to enjoy chatting to me too. 

It was now the summer holidays, I was working for my dad at the time helping him sort stock in his shop, when I got a text of Dana (who I'd barely spoken to since she ignored me, also texts weren't cheap!). She was with Ellanor, and Ellanor was asking if I was single and wanted to date her? Mind blown. There was no way... I mean obviously I said yes, of course. Dana didn't like that, but whatever. And so I started texting Ellanor, and we continued the same kind of conversations we used to have at school, ending our messages ""ilu"" as you do. I never met her during this time, and ultimately she dumped me later during the same holiday for someone else while she was away on bible-camp which sucked. So have I been in a relationship with her? If you include short childish non-contact relationships then yes, I suppose lol. It doesn't really count though in my mind.

After that, things carried on basically as normal between me and Ellanor. In fact we actually became even closer and at some point, she had an argument with one of her friends and asked if I would hang out with her during breaks, which of course I did. This wasn't short-lived and would carry on for the rest of our years at school, just me and her hanging out during all breaks. We had more lessons together through the years and always sat next to each other. We even started going round each others houses, spending time together at the weekend, and even sleepovers - my mum was always paranoid and used to say ""separate beds only"" so she used to sleep in my bed and I would sleep in the spare room. We used to go to town together, meet other people (almost as a couple, but friends) and if there was ever a snow day, we used to walk and meet eachother half-way and have snowball fights and talk about our futures. It was perfect.

In our last year of school, she started dating one of her old friends older brothers (we'll call him Arnold). This killed me inside, but I avoided conflict with her at all costs at the time so I just kept my mouth shut and hoped it was nothing. Then she lost her virginity to him, which absolutely destroyed me, and I became vocal about my feelings to her, confessing how much I loved her. I think she liked the fact that that I loved her, it didn't seem to come as a surprise to her and she said she loved me too, but she would get annoyed with me if I went on for too long. She used to say one day we very likely would be together, but she wanted to experiment, and ultimately this guy wasn't her type anyway. I felt better with that, and so I used to hang out with them as a third-wheel. Me and Ellanor continued going round each others houses and hanging out, and this sort of thing carried on into our college years. I remember skipping a college exam because we were cuddling and playing Portal (game). I actually stopped hating Arnold and we ended up getting on pretty well all considered. These were turbulent times, emotions were high and erratic, extreme highs and lows.

Ellanor one day told me she was pregant, with Arnolds child. It was a mix of emotions - you see a common theme is that I separate my own emotions from my friendship emotions, it's possible for me to both be really happy for her as a friend and completely jealous and distraught personally. I don't know if anyone can relate to this? Anyway, when she had her first child, I helped her choose a name (well, I gave her the idea of picking a name which was formal-sounding normally but would sound 'cool' when shortened, so he could be whatever he chooses). I was there for her and Arnold thoughout. I held her son as a newborn, used to look after him if she had to go out to the shop while Arnold was at work. Neither of them had a car, but I did, so I would take Ellanor anywhere she wanted to go, even getting a child-seat for that purpose. Basically I was like a kind of god father, but despite getting on very well with both of them and doing far more for their son than anyone else they knew, I never got the title. During this time, she still used to say she loved me, but obviously had to stay with Arnold for their child.

At some point, her and Arnold broke up, she felt he was weak and bad with money. I felt bad for Arnold as he was actually a nice guy, and I stayed in touch and ended up selling him my old motorbike for a really reasonable price (something which will haunt me later). She continued living in the council house, and didn't have much income. So I used to buy things for both her and her son whenever I visited, offering to help with bills etc, she declined, she's very independent. I tried to peruse a relationship but she would say she needs time after separating from Arnold, which I understood. 

During this time, Ellanor convinced me that I should find a girlfriend, she wasn't ready for a relationship and I had no experience, I was still a virgin. So, I did. I met a girl (we'll call her Bryony) who was beautiful and into the same music I was. I never felt 'the shimmer' that I did with Ellanor, but I was happy. I ended up loosing my virginity to her and things were pretty great. But I still spoke with Ellanor throughout this and even introduced Bryony to her, which was a fatal mistake because Bryony said later ""you never look at me the way you look at her"". That was the beginning of the end of that relationship, and we broke up a while later. Ellanor also met someone else, but the relationship was short-lived and the guy ended up texting me asking me to convince Ellanor to get back with him (as if I'd help another guy get with her lmao).

Ellanor and Arnold continued an on/off relationship for a while following this until at some point she started learning to drive, and ended up getting with her driving instructor (we'll call him Narc). Out of all of her partners, he was by far the worst by miles, a narcissist who used to hurt Ellanor and shout at her son, the whole thing was awful. This highlights why I feel accepting when she has a nice partner, someone who at least cares. He embodied the opposite of everything I felt for her, yet she chose him and not me. But he had money, quite a lot of it actually. They moved repeatedly into larger and larger houses over the course of these years. I don't think she loved him, or even liked him, I think she just wanted security? During this time, we were still very close. She used to come round a lot and talk with my mum about being a new mum, and we used to spend a lot of time cycling and going on adventures whenever her son was staying with Arnold. We went to a festival, many different gigs and concerts together, and we even went on holiday to Cyprus together, just me and Ellanor. There was one time I remember clearly, me and Ellanor went out for a few drinks together and we ended up kissing most of the night. She said she loved me, but couldn't be with me because it would ""ruin our friendship"". In any case, I feel she needed to escape Narc, and naturally I was ready to step in when the time came.

Eventually that time would come, she said he was abusive and without telling him, managed to get a council house. One day when he was at work, I rented a van and drove round, picked up all of her belongings with her, and moved her into her new home without him even noticing. She was safe now. Naturally she was in a bad place, and told me (before I asked) that she just needed a friend and a shoulder to cry on, not a relationship with anyone. I understood, and I was there. Every day after work I'd pop through and bring her a coffee and a cake from a local coffee shop (I worked very close to her new place) and I used to have a really good laugh with her and her son who was now walking and talking. 

Bonfire night was approaching, and the town she lived in is well-known for their enormous firework displays. Her son was staying with Arnold, and so naturally we decided to go out for some drinks in the town and watch the display, it was going to be great. While we were out, we bumped into old school friends, one of them was a guy (we'll call him Looser) I was freinds with since a baby, my parents were friends with Loosers parents. He kept making advances on Ellanor, and she was accepting them. I pulled Ellanor to one side and reminded her that this is a friend that went back generations, and that I loved her, and to leave this one. She told me to stop being a party pooper and doubled-down, now getting really close. So I pulled looser to one side to say the same, and he told me to stop being a party pooper just as she did. Eventually we had a big argument and he ended up going back to hers and they slept together. Absolutely the worst thing anyone has ever done to me, I'd be out of prison by now if I did what I thought of doing at the time, but instead I stopped talking to her completely.

In the time that followed, I was still friends with Arnold, we never lost touch, and now me and him would go for nights out with others. I still felt for him at this time, he was down on his luck but always doing the right things. We would talk about Ellanor, he still obviously spoke to her when they met to drop-off / pick-up their son, and apparently Ellanor used to ask after me. I was so heartbroken and angry at her, but I also used to think of her all the time, it was hell. I ended up going completely off the rails, drinking all the time and going clubbing constantly, anything to drown out the sound of Ellanors voice in my head. But it never really worked, it just made things worse. This went on for a few years. My route to work went past a field she had a horse in, and occasionally I'd see her car parked-up there. I missed her. I would play our old favorite songs and just sob as I drove past. 

At some point, I couldn't take it anymore. It had been years and I missed her more than ever. After writing and deleting text messaged hundreds of times, I eventually told Ellanor I missed her. She was really happy to hear from me and invited me to her horse yard. When we met, she apologized for what had happened (Ellanor never says sorry) and told me I meant a lot to her. I forgave her, and we carried on like before. This time I would spend a lot of time at the stables with her, and it was wonderful. Who'd have thought picking up poo would be so magical? It was! 

She'd had another partner in this time, I didn't know the guy well but was aware of him, but it had ended and she was now back with Narc again (for some ridiculous reason). They moved again to another bigger house, and as you can expect, things went downhill for her as he once again was abusive. She also moved her horse closer to where she now lived, and the yard was picturesque, actually stunning, in a nice area. Naturally she'd retreat there and I'd spend a lot of time with her and the others at the stables. In the evenings we would all have a few glasses of wine and a laugh together with the horses and yard cat, it was actually great.

As expected, this would come to an end in what I can only assume was similar to before. The difference this time is that whatever happened, she stopped talking to me and basically everyone else. I became so concerned about her, I ended up messaging her mum to make sure she was ok. Apparently she was, so I couldn't do anything to help. She just didn't want to talk. It hurt, but I knew it was difficult for her, so I left it and just sent the occasional message of encouragement.

During this time, Arnold had a serious motorbike accident, on the bike I sold him years ago. He was resuscitated on scene and brought back, ended up in a coma, and when he came round he had permanent brain damage. He's still functional, but due to personality changes, he doesn't consider us friends anymore and his fits of rage lost him any custody rights of his son after being dragged out through family court. Absolutely tragic, just heartbreaking. 

When Ellanor eventually started speaking to me again, she'd had several relationships in that time and she had also gone off the rails. She was now with another guy (we'll call him Alex) but we didn't meet, we'd just speak on the phone or text. This went on for some years. To be honest, without Ellanor I'd fallen deep into depression and lost my way. I felt too embarrassed to see her, but we continued speaking via calls / messages. Ellanor and Alex also had another 2 children in a short time, and bought a house together - which naturally lead to me feeling very low despite being happy for her.

Eventually just recently, we agreed to meet up for the first time in ages. Me and Ellanor went into town for dinner and some drinks, and had an amazing time. I remember as we walked, she held my arm, and she looked at me with this twinkle in her eye, the one that says she loves me. Magical! I was working away during the week but we would send voice messages daily and meet up every other weekend, things were great. I met Alex and he seems like a nice guy. The issue was, I noticed she was wearing an engagement ring. Now we always said one day we'd be together, one day we'd get married. Every relationship she had up until this point was temporary in my mind, and I panicked. So I bought her an engagement ring but before I had a change to propose, she said she needed some time apart (which was fairly typical after being very close for a while). In my desperation of not knowing if / when they had a wedding planned, I told her about my intentions. That lead to an argument and now we're not talking at all, since a week ago.

I went into the darkest place I've ever been in, so bad that it scared me. For the first time in my life I sought counseling and found out about limerence which made so much sense to me about the cycles we had been through. I also found out that our attachment styles play a big part, I'm an anxious preoccupied and she's a dismissive avoidant - which if you don't know have the effect of being like magnets to start with, then having a symbiotic relationship which is very stable for a while but collapses under any stress into being the worst possible combination, where I become desperate for reassurance and comfort and she becomes desperate to avoid feeling suffocated and needing of space. It's also noteworthy that anxious preoccupied attachment styles hold onto their LO a very long time and it can be excruciatingly painful when there's no more contact, whereas dismissive avoidant suddenly switch off and find a sense of releif when contact ends. The two likely come back together, given suupport and reassurance is what an anxious preoccupied longs for, and the idolisation and admiration of an anxious preoccupied is apparently like a sirens song to a dismissive avoidant, the two are strongly attracted emotionally.

Throughout all of this (which I haven't detailed above) we have had noticable cycles. We'd meet and it would be overwhelmingly fantastic, then settle into being really close as we catch up and share our stories, but if anything upset the apple cart in the slightest then it would all just fall apart. We'd then have a period of no contact, until eventually we'd meet again to repeat the cycle. We are now 31, coming up 32, so this has been going on for 20 years now. It's only now I'm beginning to understand it through therapy. It's also important to note that throughout all this time, she has always told me she loves me, and of course visa-versa, even up to 3 weeks ago! Granted we'd had a couple of bottles of wine, but she confessed she ""loved me in the same way I loved her"" and ""thought we were soulmates"" but that ""I really needed to pack it in and move on and find someone else because it would ruin our friendship if we were together"" which I find ironic because it was the lack of a relationship which is ultimately ruining our friendship. It always weighed on me heavily that we never at least tried to be together (well I did). It's at the point now where they are going to get married and have 3 kids, so at what point do you call it quits? But how can I call it quits when 100% of her relationships have ended up until now? I can't tell myself ""it's over"" when it's been ""over"" many times before and then back on again. In any case, I truly miss our friendship, it means the world to me and I would love to salvage just that if I could. It's a lot right now to consider, my head is still spinning, but it's starting to make more and more sense. I hope one day I'll find the answers I need.",2,1763262672.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

I do ask for you generous to keep in mind that I am autistic so my way of speaking may seem off. Also anxiety is so fun.

At the beginning of the year(can't remember exact date so let's say beginning) I learned that a game franchise is just got into a while ago is doing a remake/ revamp of a ds title. The game is Story of seasons grand bazaar. I didn't know the history of the story of seasons games, all I new was it was the studio behind rune factory and that I enjoyed pioneers of olive town. The release of the game was in August. I couldn't get it at the time because I was dealing with a string of bad luck.

Recently I decided to finally pursue a dream of mine, so I saved up to buy a laptop. Apart of that saving was my sister (who i live with) told me to not give her rent money for the month of October. So I did, then I bought the laptop, and told my sister that since I found it on a good deal I'll give her whatever is left after the purchase. She told me to use it for Christmas. I plan on paying her next month as well as getting replacement mixing bowls.

I at the time had no idea what to get people for Christmas. Now I have some ideas. The problem is that a couple of days ago I received an email that story of seasons grand bazaar is on sale and it will end on the 27th. And it is making me struggle. My plan was to buy it, a dlc for house flipper 2, and grim dawn next year. But my mind says go for it. And the barista at my favorite local coffee shop told me to go for it to.

1oyascq,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1oyascq/habits_of_my_narcissistic_mother/,Habits of my narcissistic mother,"Sharing incase it helps others, and partly as a journal for myself. For context, I'm 32F, and my dad, brother and I came to the consensus years ago that she's deeply narcissistic, but it affects me significantly more than anyone else as I'm her only daughter.

* **Competition** \- I am her competition, always have been. If family or family friends compliment me on my personality or give the slightest hint that they like talking to me more than her, I can feel her glare burning into me. Looks are a different story (see below), because if I look bad it makes her look bad and she's super vain.
* **Lying / no integrity** \- She'll straight up lie to make me look worse to others (I've overheard her more than once on the phone, for example, calling *me* ""manipulative"" to a friend). Her moral compass is weak - whatever's most self-serving goes.
* **Victimization** \- She'll also lie about me (and my dad, who's similar to me) to victimize herself to friends and family. My dad and I see through her more than anyone (my brother unfortunately is somewhat arrogant like her) and, since she hates that about us, she'll convince herself and her friends that we're problematic and make her life miserable. She generally *loves* being pitied.
* **Self-aggrandizing/bragging** \- Super blatant. She'll tell the same handful of stories about herself to anyone that will listen, over and over again for decades on end. How she had multiple guys fawning over her in her early 20s and the specific things they did for her to get her attention, that she was a lifestyle model for 1 year, etc., how she's a ""scientist"" because she worked got her degree in computer science (of course leaving out that she never spent a day of her working career in it)... the examples are endless. She has zero self-awareness that others just don't care/aren't impressed. Worst part is she'll say these things in the most cringey/obviously narcisisstic way (""I just cannot believe that guy did that for me! Like who does that, who goes *so* out of their way to show that much doting love and obsession for someone in their 20s..."").
* **Obsessive about looks/image** \- She'll permanently delete nostalgic family photos because she doesn't absolutely love how she looks in them, even if another family member has expressed they prize that photo (but will turn around and post any photo of you - even solo ones - publicly to her 3000+ network on social media even if you've expressed insecurity about it and asked her kindly not to). She enrolled me in a scam modeling 'school' at 10 years old lol. She started getting blonde highlights in my hair from when I was 7 years old, against my will, and then dying my hair fully light brown in middle school (I have black hair - both looked horrible on me). She can't live with herself if she doesn't always have her nails professionally painted/perfect, 2+ times per month, and she pours $$ (my dad's lol) into all kinds of skincare, treatments, etc.
* **Highly critical/insulting to me** \- Mostly looks related, but other things too. She frequently looks/behaves disgusted and has always reprimanded me for my 'asymmetrical smile', acne, severe psoriasis (as if I can control it), not wearing makeup, not getting my haircut how she tells me to, etc. She also won't hesitate to call me stupid or insult my character at any opportunity. She also calls me antisocial frequently (she thinks it's a bad look to not be super social, it's a status thing) and rags on me for my anxious/ocd/self-soothing habits (that I'm pretty confident I developed in large part because of her). 
* **Can't take criticism herself** \- Like well meaning, gentle, ""I'm sharing this because something you said kind of hurt me"" type stuff. She turns it back on you and immediately has a raging fury, and insults you like nothing else for daring to suggest that she's not perfect 24/7. Once my dad called her out (rather gently) for insisting on driving us home when she was mad drunk, he forced her to swap seats so he could drive us instead, and she was so insulted that when the car basically started failing us and we needed her iphone (Volt key/controller) to solve the issue and prevent a serious accident on the highway, she hid her phone under her seat out of any of our reach. Dad, brother and I got sent into panic/psychosis and talked at home bc we finally realized she's genuinely evil. 
* **Inhumane treatment as a child** \- I was spanked and yelled at any time I would remotely cry (like at 3 years old for example), or spill yogurt, or do anything else totally natural for a literal baby to do. Just got worse as I got older - emotion was never safe or welcome around her.
* **Man-hating + male-centering simultaneously** \- this one's confusing, but it boils down to which narrative is most convenient for her narcissism. She centers men in that she clearly wants their attn at every opportunity, party, etc. and wants them to like her more than other women. But she's also constantly blatantly bashing men - largely because anything that she's not must be inferior. Her race is better than others, her gender is, anything she is is best (but deep down she's insecure about all of those things). 
* **Entitlement/authority over others** \- Like cleaners and other service people around the house. Anyone who she pays for a service is her inferior. Unsurprisingly, she's spoken to cashiers and waitresses in rather yucky and expecting ways too. Telling people younger than her they should make sure they 'have kids before it's too late' (I'm pretty sure she regrets having kids haha she hates me, so this is just to make sure others are miserable too - she doesn't realize other people genuinely might like kids.)
* **Golddigging** \- Her and my dad frequently get in arguments because of her using insane amounts of his $ in ways he isn't even aware of, much less discussed with her. It's pretty obvious (but not to my dad) that she married him because he's a naive, hardworking, loyal, rather insecure (but not narcissistic) guy who will stay committed out of principle (and because he's the kind of guy to see the best in others even when there is none). He knows at this point she's messed up, but to this day he'll also make excuses for her frequently and delude himself into thinking she's well-intentioned where she's definitely not. My dad actually did seriously consider divorcing her (before they had me ha), which is crazy for someone like him - he's a commitment at all costs kind of guy. He never told her he was having those thoughts, but asked his parents for advice. They encouraged him to end it (also crazy, bc they're also traditionalistic) but he stayed despite that. I think it's because they already had a kid and he knew she'd villainize him/make his life miserable both to their friends/family and to his son.
* **Literally just inconsiderate** \- Her way or the highway. My dad can't have his coffee machine anywhere in the actual kitchen lol, but she can have and do whatever with the kitchen. Just in the flow of her daily life, no one else's feelings really enter the picture - she might break something of ours and not mention it, toss something in the fridge that's not hers without checking with others, etc.
* **Invasive and controlling** \- when I dated someone for the first time in my 20s, she caught wind of it and tracked all our call history (verizon family plan), got his phone number, looked up everything about him, and then read through our entire text history on my phone (naturally including *super* private stuff) when we met up for a vacation, and then harassed me about how I shouldn't be with him (without knowing him at all). One of those things where she has to be on top of my life to make sure I'm never too happy or something. 
* **Insane gaslighting** \- Off the rails. Pretending things never happened at all or that things were never said, legit making you think you're crazy and fully denying any and all of her wrongdoing. 

To no one's surprise, I'm exhausted and just don't want her in my life.",25,1763262312.0,raisedbynarcissists,6,1.0,False

1oyanso,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oyanso/every_full_moon_my_roommates_eat_me_alive_its_my/,"Every full moon, my roommates eat me alive. It's my fault. Part 3.","Consciousness was *pain*.

I was moving, squashed against something warm.

Something... no, *someone*... writhing.

It took me a disorienting moment to realize I was in the trunk of someone's car. 

I wasn't alone. 

I could feel his ice-cold breath on my face, and when I dared open my eyes, I saw the eerie sliver of a crescent moon reflected in his iris. 

So bright, and yet so beautiful.

Rowan wasn't completely *done* yet. 

There were still pieces of him that were contorted, confusing static struggling to stitch his skin back together.

But he was awake, his half-lidded eyes piercing into me.

“Urgh. I fucking haaaate you.” 

His voice was a whispered slurry mumble, and I could sense the darkness seeping back into me, ready to tear me away once again. 

The two of us were pressed together, eye to eye, our arms bound behind our backs, so there was no way to avoid that uncomfortable conversation neither of us wanted to have. “You're drugged.” I whispered, testing out my new mouth. 

He responded with a spluttered laugh. 

“Ahhctually, for the first tiiiime in a while I am completely 100% soberrrr right now, so you're going to fuhhhcking *listen* to me.” 

Moving closer, I could hear his heavy breaths, his attempts at stifling a panic attack. 

Rowan Beck had suffered from them his whole life.  But I had to remind myself this wasn't him. 

Rowan’s voice broke apart, and for a moment, he blinked away that mesmerising light, and seemed maybe kind of human. 

“Nin.” He whispered. “I'm begging you.” His warm lips grazed my cheek. 

I don't think that was his choice, especially when the car we were in flew over a speed bump. “Please save them.”

Instead of speaking, I found myself running my hands through his hair.

Wait, wasn't I tied up? 

My head was spinning, two versions of Rowan swimming in front of me. 

“Do you remember that show when we were kids?” I was aware I was drawing out my words too much, but my tongue was swollen. “You know! The one with the, uhmmm…”

He laughed, and maybe it was him being not fully there, or maybe it was genuine. 

“Fuck *off*.” Rowan’s voice cracked into a snort. “I’m not a fish.”

I laughed too, the two of us suddenly in hysterics. 

Maybe we *were* drugged. 

I woke (for the second time) to *screaming.*

Both inside the room I was in, and further away. Faded, but still bleeding through the walls.

The cries closer to me, blowing my eardrums out, weren’t human.

It wasn’t just screaming. It was brutal. Animalistic. A banshee wail I felt in my brain and in my bones, numbing my body and freezing me in place as I woke from slumber. It took me a moment to gather my bearings, memories flooding back.

I was in the car with Rowan, and we…crashed. 

I remembered I’d died for the 28th time. I remembered Rowan’s body being copied right in front of me, static becoming flesh, and flesh becoming skin. The rest was a blur. I had a vague recollection of flashes, like my memories were being fast-forwarded. 

Once I knew I was fully real, that my body wasn’t made of static, I had tried to drag Rowan out of the road. 

Then a sharp pain hit the back of my head, the world spun around, and… darkness.

I came to expecting the hollow sensation and the hunger, but I just felt dizzy. 

I was lying face down on the floor in my bedroom back at the house in a fresh puddle of drool. I knew it was my room because I could smell the exotic plants I kept on my window, and the raspberry-scented perfume plugged into the outlet. 

Slowly, I sat up, resisting the urge to cover my ears to block out the cry. It was agonising, nothing I’d ever heard before. In the corner of my eye, I saw her, a shape bleeding into my vision. 

Somehow, I knew she was crying in pain. 

It was agony and fear and anger enveloped in one hysterical cry, burning her lungs out and setting her body on fire. 

Imogen. 

I could feel my housemate’s scream like a living entity crawling inside my brain. 

Like she was dying.

And somehow, I could feel it. 

The entity slicing into my soupy brain and twining itself around my spinal cord.

Like Rowan, she was sickly pale and gaunt, but somehow beautiful. 

Lying in a pool of halo-colored hair and moonlit eyes, my housemate writhed like she was possessed. 

But she didn’t look like a monster. She was in pain, each wail wracking her body.

She was like an animal, I thought. An animal who needed to be put down. An animal I couldn’t stand to see like that. 

Her vacant eyes didn’t fully find me until I shook her, and life began to return to her expression slowly before she sat up. 

Imogen was trembling, her eyes raw, filled with tears, and not quite human, but I could believe for a moment, if I suspended my disbelief, that she wasn’t a monster. 

My housemate stared at me, blinking rapidly, like I was a hallucination, before her hand whipped out, claw-like fingernails slicing into my flesh.

I felt her desperation, each nail digging into my skin and drawing blood. 

She could smell me. 

Rowan said that the three of them had been starving for the last few days and seeing me must have been agony.

Before she seemingly caught hold of herself, Imogen’s grip loosened, her clammy fingers detaching from my flesh.

My housemate’s expression crumpled, humanity blooming back into fruition. Her voice grew stronger. “Please!” 

She was growing progressively more hysterical. “You have to stop them! They’re hurting them!” 

Imogen tried to get up, but she was so weak. 

I found myself reaching out a hand and yanking her to unsteady feet, and once she could hold herself, my housemate dragged herself over to the door. She needed to eat, I thought dizzily. But it’s not like the snacks I hid under my bed would do anything. 

I knew exactly what Imogen needed. 

Once I was close enough to the door, I could hear it: low murmurs, followed by yelling. And judging from Imogen’s expression, I knew we weren’t alone.

There were people downstairs. Strangers. 

Remembering the figure looming over me, the person who had knocked me out and brought me home, I shivered. Who would do that? I thought. They had kidnapped me, and presumably Rowan too, and brought us home? 

“Stop who?” I managed to get out.

My housemate was sobbing, trying and failing to get the door open, her twitching fingers scraping the handle. 

I sucked in a breath and grabbed her hands, squeezing them. 

The same thing I did in our freshman year, and I found holding her hands and talking to her in hushed whispers calmed her down enough to talk. 

This time, however, my housemate was inconsolable. I did what I could to break through. “Imogen.” I spoke stiffly. “You need to tell me what’s going on, okay?”

I squeezed her hands tighter, and her wails turned into soft whimpers. I hadn’t forgotten what she was, and who I was to her, nothing but food. 

But right then, we were both dealing with an unsuspected mutual enemy. 

I shook her again when she let out a sharp cry. Her whole body was trembling, and I fought to stabilize her. 

Every erratic movement threatened to buckle her legs. 

""Imogen. Who's downstairs?""

Her expression darkened, and I caught that sliver of moonlight glinting around her iris. 

Somehow, my housemate was acting territorial. 

“There are strangers,” she said through her teeth. “They’re hurting us, and I can’t stand it, Nin. They’re hurting us… they won’t stop hurting us, and my head… my head feels like it’s on fire. I can’t... think straight….” 

She drifted off, grabbing the door handle with one hand, and my arm with the other. I didn’t fight against her strength. I didn’t hear the rest of what she said; it was caught up in a territorial hiss ripping from her throat.

Imogen’s grip tightened once again as my housemate dragged me down the hallway. 

She flattened us against the wall and twisted to me, pressing a shaky finger to her lips. *Follow me*, her eyes told me. 

I held my breath, sticking to her steady stride. “The guys,” I managed to get out. “Did they…”

What was I going to say?

Did they hurt someone? 

Kaz and Rowan were unpredictable under the full moon. I had no idea what they were capable of.

It must have been them downstairs, them doing the hurting. After all, in my head, they were monsters.

“No.” Imogen whimpered. “It’s a group of them.” She said, “They’re hurting us!”

Imogen’s humanity practically emitted from her like an aura. I saw fear, pain, and anger. All human emotions.

“Kaz and Rowan,” she said in sharp gasps. “They killed them. Over and over again, they keep killing them! And it hurts!""

Copying, I thought dizzily.

Someone, no doubt the person who had kidnapped Rowan and me, was torturing them.

Imogen swallowed a cry, her expression twisting. 

She didn’t finish that sentence, and that only left more questions as she pulled me further down the stairs. 

The low murmur of voices got louder, until I could hear them clearly. 

A man, or a group of them. As we neared the door, Immie grew stiff. 

“Stay with me.” my housemate breathed. She turned to me, her eyes glowing, that eerie white bleeding into her irises. 

I couldn’t trust her, not when her expression had melted into something inhuman, something I’d expect from a horror movie. Her teeth came out in a vicious growl, her steel grip tightening.

The monster my housemate was, however, was surprisingly protective. 

When I tried to pull my arm from hers, Imogen made a hissing sound, digging her fingernails in. When I caught sight of the front door, I had a chance to run. 

I had a chance to rip my arm from her grasp, lunge into a sprint, and not look back. 

But I didn’t. 

When I jumped from the last step, the downstairs hallway was quiet.

The intruders were in the lounge. 

I could sense them, and I knew she could too; her nostrils flared like a wild animal as she followed their scent, moving in quick strides. 

I followed, not as quick as her, my body leaning back, trying to escape.

“It’s a full moon,” Immie said under her breath. “Kaz and I had just enough time to protect the house before they came.”

“What?” I whispered. I’d already checked, and totality wasn’t expected until September 10th. I’d checked multiple times to ensure I’d have enough time to escape before a full moon fell on us. 

But even as I thought that, my eyes found the clumsily taped-up front door, and if I squinted, I could just about glimpse the tiniest fragment of moon peeking in. 

“They broke in,” she said. “Those bastards broke in and took Kaz and then hunted down you and Rowan.”

As she spoke, my housemate pulled me towards the lounge, where I knew the 
kidnappers were. 

Immie stiffened up when she reached the door. 

I think part of her enjoyed searching each room beforehand, like she was hunting them down. She reminded me of a lioness losing her cubs. Whoever hurt Kaz and Rowan was dead, and we both knew that. 

I could tell from the way she moved, squeezing my arm like I was some kind of anchor.

We found the boys inside the lounge, surrounded by a group of strangers. 

I didn’t know what to look at first. 

The windows were taped up, blocking out the night bleeding in, a protection from the moon. 

Scattered around the room were various versions of my housemates, copies of them strewn across the floor. 

If it had been my first time, I might have thought I was seeing things, or even in a dream of my own making. 

There was so much blur between fiction and reality.

Inside that room at that moment, that line had been crossed multiple times.

What I was seeing reminded me of an Adult Swim commercial. 

I can’t remember which one, but I do know that those commercials were made to spread unease and play with that so-called line which separated reality and our own dreams.

The copies were in varying states: decapitated heads and severed limbs leaking static mixed with blood soaking into the carpet. It was like seeing a cartoon leak into real life. The canny, with the uncanny. My stomach twisted at the sight before my gaze found the current versions. 

Rowan and Kaz were strapped back to back, duct tape covering their mouths, feral teeth slicing through the gags. 

They looked like fresh copies, but I knew from experience the pain clung on, and memories were still fresh, even before they faded. I knew they were fucking strong. Rowan had pinned me to my seat with one hand, and Immie’s grip on me was cutting off my blood circulation. 

But somehow, the restraints pinning their wrists to the chair’s armrests were enough to hold them down. 

Kaz’s gaze met mine, his expression crumpling, like he was ashamed. 

He rapidly shook his head, gesturing for me to run. 

Rowan tipped his head back, snarling through his gag. His eyes were already half drowned in moonlight, already half taken over. The two of them were nowhere near moonlight, with it being trapped behind the taped-up windows. 

But I still saw it coming to life in their eyes, in their cracking skin splintering apart, static moonlight leaking out. 

It was strange seeing the hunters become the hunted. 

Imogen didn’t speak.

Her eyes were wide, her expression feral

When she made a move toward the boys, an oldish-looking man stepped in front of her, and I recognized him from Sam’s group of friends. He was one of the people who had surrounded Sam’s coffee table, marking something on a piece of paper, and actively trying to hide when Poppy dragged me in.

Now that I was taking in the others, I realized they were all from Sam’s house.

I recognized a dark-haired teenage boy and an older woman with greying hair and a thinning smile wielding a knife that I knew had already killed the boys multiple times. The leader's eyes ignited. “See?” 

He turned to the others. “I knew the little bitch would come try save her boys.”

He grabbed Kaz’s hair, yanking the boy’s head back. Kaz glared at me, like *I* was the problem, before averting his gaze.

He didn't fight back, squeezing his eyes shut.

Rowan shoved him, muffle screaming, but Kaz didn't move. 

“We’ve been playing with your friends for a while now,” The man’s grin made me nauseous. He was talking to Imogen. “Now you’re deciding to come downstairs?”

I watched the group take their positions, following orders. A familiar sandy-colored ponytail sent my heart into my throat. 

I must have been seeing things, right? 

Sure, I was seeing some of Sam’s friends, but I wasn’t seeing my best friend himself. 

That idea quickly splintered when I glimpsed his face. 

I wanted to find his expression frozen in some kind of trance. 

I wanted to believe he was brainwashed or under some kind of control. 

But Sam’s eyes were lit up with excitement, anticipation, his lips pulling into a small smile as his group surrounded Rowan and Kaz.

He must have seen me with Imogen, must have known that I was in the room. 

As much as I struggled to meet his gaze, however, I realized he was actively ignoring me. Sam was armed. 

The boy who told me he was scared of fireworks going off was armed with a scary-looking blade sticking from his belt, a handgun moulded into his palm. 

Imogen, trembling, stepped in front of me. Her lips curled back into a hiss, and the man’s eyes widened.

“See. She's a monster.” The man cocked his head, and I tore my gaze from Sam. “A devil too, I presume.”

Devils. My eyes took in the rest of them, their disgusted sneers. That’s what these people thought they were.

Imogen winced, hurt by their words, but she held herself together.

“They’re not devils.” I heard myself say, surprised by my confidence. 

I had spent days trying to escape the monsters in my house, the monsters who were killing and eating me. 

Yet, I was still a resident, and Sam and his gang were the intruders.

“Get out.” I said, directing my words at Sam. I was going to kill him.

Then I was going to kill his friends. 

“This has nothing to do with you.” I sucked my teeth. “Also, they're *clearly* werewolves.”

Rowan caught my eye, his expression crumpling. 

Even with the duct tape gag, his eyes perfectly screamed, “Are you *serious*?”

“No, Nin.” Imogen murmured. “I want to know who the *fuck* they think they are.”

Imogen’s gaze snapped to the man, her lips curling into a snarl. “Why are you hurting my family?”

Her grip slipped from my arm, and I was free. I was free to run, but I didn’t. 

Immie’s eyes reminded me of a cornered animal. She was frantic. 

“Who *are* you?” 

It was the first time I’d heard Imogen Prairie sound threatening. 

I’d known her for two years, and I’d never seen this side of her.

The monster she had been trying to hide.

She opened her mouth to speak but stopped when the teenage boy, who looked to be thirteen at most, lunged forward, grabbed Rowan by the scruff of his neck, yanked his head back, and plunged the knife he’d been playing with into my housemate’s stomach.

Rowan screamed, an agonizing raw wail piercing my brain. But his cry wasn’t alone. Kaz, struggling wildly, howled into his gag—and Imogen squeaked, slamming a hand over her mouth. 

And then it hit me. Why I’d woken to her crying, writhing on my bed. 

Why her tangled words had been barely decipherable on her tongue.

“Stop!” She screamed, dropping all pretense. 

Imogen could feel them. 

Everything they felt, everything the two of them were going through, she felt it too, and it was ripping her apart. 

Every copy of the boys who had been tortured and murdered, Imogen felt everything. Their pain. 

Their deaths. 

Their rebirths. 

Chuckling, the man pulled the knife out with a whistle.

It slid easily back through several layers of skin, though the knife was wet with static. 

Imagine something you didn’t think was tangible, didn’t think could be touched, and there it was, slicking the blade. 

There was a cavern in his gut, and already the blood was draining away, the skin stitching back together with pooling static. The man’s eyes were wide, lips stretched into a grin. 

“This is a fascinating magic trick,” he leered. “Why don’t you tell me, huh? How do these guys do it? We can slice up your boys and cut off their heads, and they just grow another one!”

His shriek of laughter pierced my ears, and I caught Rowan’s half-lidded eyes flick to the window still covered with tape.

Imogen's lip curled. She was already keeping an eye on him. Something told me the chair wasn't going to hold him for long.

“Rowan.” she spat. “I'm *handling* it.”

He responded with a snort, muffling through the tape.

“Well, you're doing a *great* fucking job!”

“I’ve got a question.” The kid stepped forward with a scowl. I expected Imogen to attack him, but she just stood there, paralyzed, her body rattling with the boy’s pain. 

“What did you devils do to my brother?” 

His words stirred something in my mind. 

Is that what they had been doing? Before me, had they feasted on others?

Others who didn’t share my ability to come back.

No. 

Because they made it pretty clear all they *could* eat was me. 

The leader, who was more in awe than disgusted, laughed. “You're devil spawn hiding in  an innocent’s body! Why don’t we have another look at what’s inside, hmm?” 

To my surprise, he gestured to Sam. 

“The Delacroix devil is an old flame, right? He’s all yours, Samuel. And don’t show any mercy, kid.”

In two quick steps, he was in front of Kaz, slapping him across the face. I saw Imogen’s expression darken significantly. Rowan snarled like an animal.

The man raised his voice, addressing the rest of them. “Just like I told you—this thing isn’t Charlie Delacroix. It’s a mimic. This creature wearing the boy’s handsome smile is nothing more than a suit of flesh for a devil, and we’re putting him down.” 

He laughed. “And we’ll do it again, and again, and a-fucking-gain—until he stays dead.”

Every word was emphasised as he ducked in front of Kaz, spitting each one in his face. 

Sam straightened up. He caught my eye before quickly looking away. 

“Yes, sir.”

“And remember,” the man grunted. “They aren’t human. I don’t know what the fuck they are. They're demons. They don’t even have shadows! Look at them! They bleed darkness, and they're feasting on townspeople!""

Sam didn’t move for a moment before nodding and striding over to my housemate.

Kaz weakly lifted his head, and I caught a glance between them. It was so fast I barely saw it, but it was definitely there. 

Familiarity and hatred mixed together in a cocktail burning between the two of them.

Sam didn’t hesitate, stabbing the blade through Kaz’s hand, and just like clockwork, Rowan and Imogen reacted in sync, jolting, like they had been electrocuted. Sam didn’t stop. 

He plunged the knife again and again, each thrust more violent, more brutal, telling a story. 

When Kaz’s body arched back, and he lunged forward in his chair, screaming through the tape over his mouth, howling like a beast, Sam twisted the blade deeper until it perforated bone, which turned to static, rewriting itself back into existence. 

Kaz’s body didn't make *sense*. 

Rowan’s cries turned animalistic as he kicked and screamed, his razor-sharp teeth slicing through the tape. 

Sam. 

No matter how much he seemed to enjoy it, there was something else in his eyes. 

Something I think he was in denial of, which only motivated him further. 

He was upset. No, angry.

Fuming.

My housemate’s pained wails were in perfect harmony, and next to me, Imogen took a different stance. 

Her grip slipped from my wrist. “Go upstairs and lock yourself in your room,” she said through sharp breaths. 

“Just like every other full moon, and don't come out until dawn.”

“What?” I managed. “Are you serious? I know what’s going on,” I swallowed. “And I want to help.”

“Help?” Imogen’s tone dripped with something sour. “So, not run away?”

“What?”

""Run."" She turned to me, her eyes pleading. ""Promise me you’ll lock yourself up. I don’t want you to see this.""

I was already backing away. “What are you going to do?""

Imogen was in agony. I could see it in her face, every contortion in her expression matching the boys’.

She offered me a sheepish smile. ""Just…talk to them.""

When I risked a look at Kaz, while Sam dragged a knife down his face, static pouring out, he was shaking his head. 

Don’t. His eyes were on Immie, desperate, as he struggled under the restraints. 

He seemed to already know what she was going to do. Imogen tried one more time. 

“If you want to talk, we’ll talk,” she said. “I’ll tell you everything about what we are. Just let them go.” Her lips pricked into a smile. “That’s your warning. Let them go, or I'll show you.""

“Show us?” the man scoffed. I inwardly cringed as he dragged his nails down Rowan’s face. Rowan snapped at him like a wild animal. “You’re already showing us! You’re inhuman! Be thankful we’re merciful enough to put you down right here—and not string you up on the gallows where you belong.”

“Then I’m sorry,” Immie said softly.

“Imogen.” Kaz muffled through his gag. I was getting déjà vu from the last full moon. 

He rocked forward in the chair, almost tipping over. ""You’re going to make it worse!""

""*Let* her do it!"" Rowan howled when an older woman with thinning white hair plunged her dagger into his arm. He was seething, a hysterical laugh bubbling. ""These bastards really think they can *kill* us?""

“Don’t do what?” the teenage boy joined in, a delirious grin on his face, circling my housemates like a shark. “You’re weak!”

Rowan spluttered. “I'm sorry, shouldn't you be playing Fortnite?”

“Imogen. Please.” Kaz chewed through his gag. “What the fuck is doing this going to accomplish?”

His gaze snapped to me, and I saw it. Disgust. Disdain he was trying to hide. 

“Tell her, Nin.”

“We just want to talk,” Imogen spoke through a growl. Her patience was thinning. “Let them go, and like I said, we’ll talk.”

But that just got a laugh from the group in response. Sam, the only one who wasn’t laughing, paused mutilating Kaz’s face. 

I noticed he was slower with the knife, like he was reveling in watching the skin slice open and splinter, bleeding moonlight.

“Talk?!” a woman screeched. Her voice was like nails on a chalkboard. “The devils want to talk to us?! Devilish wolves don't talk!”

Rowan groaned. “Jesus fucking Christ, we're not wolves!”

She pointed a gun at Imogen. “Tell me, child,” she sneered. “Would you be able to come back from a bullet in the brain? If I blow your head off, will you grow another one like them? Should I test it out? How about severing each of your limbs, hm?”

I saw the exact moment Imogen Prairie gave up. She gave up begging, gave up trying to negotiate. 

Gave up being human.

She grasped my hand, entangling her fingers with mine. 

I would be lying if I said it wasn't comforting. 

“There’s a freezer inside Rowan’s closet,” Immie said under her breath. “I want you to ignore what’s in it and lock yourself in there.”

“But—” I choked on my response, and she hissed, cutting me off.

“Now!”

I found myself nodding, my brain subconsciously submitting to that light in her eyes that was so hard to look away from. 

“Right.”

I staggered into the wall. 

Immie was next to me one moment, and then she was at the window, half of her face already illuminated in a semi-circle of moonlight. 

At first, I thought she was going to try another tactic to free the boys, maybe from the back. She was fast, after all. Faster than I thought. But… no. 

Kaz turned to me with questioning eyes before twisting to Immie, muffling into the tape over his mouth.

“Imogen, don't!”

Immie didn’t waste time, standing on her tip-toes and clawing at the protection put in place to block out the full moon. And almost as if the moon herself had been waiting in anticipation outside, fighting to get in, she seeped into the room, milky white light filling every corner and hitting every surface. 

I remember turning to run.

Though something made me turn, something, maybe morbid curiosity, twisted my body around and forced me to watch. 

Watch as I finally realized why my friends were so afraid of the full moon. 

Why they forced me to stay in my room every night and blast music until my ears were ringing. 

It was almost like they were waiting for it. 

At least, Rowan was. I knew part of him didn’t care about the control she had over him or what she made him do.

He just wanted out of that fucking chair. 

I watched his frenzied gaze fix on Sam, who was carving the flesh from my housemate’s face, before his twitching eyes darted to every corner the light bounced from. And then he went slack.

His wrists writhed against the restraints—then his face did the same.

It drooped to one side.

His whole expression went blank.

Kaz followed, at first trying to bury his head in his lap, but it was too bright, too powerful, drowning him, flooding his eyes.

Their faces, drenched in her, were... hypnotizing.

Just like the night of Abigail Matheson’s party. They stopped struggling, their frightened eyes wide, lips twisted around the gags—before going slack.

With her so close, inside the room, she filled me too.

I heard her voice, her melodic singing filling their minds.

No. Our minds. 

She was affecting me too. 

I was aware I was moving—jerking, twitching—trying to find a way out.

But I couldn’t move. She was in my head, twining herself around my being. Filling me. Teasing me. My housemates' eyes reflected the same eerie glow.

Not just the subtle halo glint I was used to seeing.

This was blinding light—light that should have scorched their eyes out. And yet it didn’t. Instead, it became part of them, weaving inside of them, fully taking over. 

She hit every reflective surface like she was burrowing deeper, overwhelming us. 

I was staring at Rowan, my gaze glued to him, that light bleeding from him was almost beautiful–hypnotising. 

I felt it beckoning me forward, and only snapped out of it when cutting fangs pierced through his ductape gag, his mouth parting in a monstrous snarl,  inhuman screech sending me to my knees. 

While the moon found her home, leeching onto their minds, I heard only the low hum of her song bleeding into my skull, enrapturing me.

The humans reacted differently. They seemed more confused.

I watched Sam’s expression shift from morbid pleasure to horror as he pulled back with the knife, but my brain couldn’t process what was happening.

Time seemed to slow down, and suddenly, there was so much screaming.

What my mind failed to grasp was that Rowan had ripped himself from the restraints, stumbling like an animal, duct tape still hanging from the corner of his mouth, and pounced on the woman who had leered at him. There wasn’t even a struggle.

I saw those brand new teeth snap out in an animalistic bite—and her headless torso hit the ground. Just like that.

So fast.

But he didn’t stop there.

Once free and fully exposed to her light, still suffocating the room, my housemate dropped to his knees, tearing into her chest and ripping out squirming, glistening insides until she was nothing more than unrecognizable flesh pulsing under his weight.

I didn’t even see Kaz escape, but his chair was overturned, and there was so much… blood. So much red illuminated under the mesmerizing moonlight, drenching everything.

It glittered under dim light, entrails and severed limbs strewn across the carpet.

Kaz had been the chilled out one, the one against killing Sam and his gang.

But once the moon seeped inside him, my usually laid-back housemate crawled across the floor, tearing into anything resembling human flesh, bounding forwards on his hands and knees like a rabid dog. 

I watched him dive on the flailing teenage boy, gnawing into him.

Mushy pink matter clung between his teeth as he chewed through the boy’s skull, newly elongated fangs splintering shattered bone and brain.

Kaz’s movements were mindless, blindly grasping for anything alive in his path.

Imogen pounced on a screaming man, ripping out his spine with a single, brutal tug.

Then Rowan—still kneeling over the woman’s remains—coughed up an eyeball. Imogen snatched it from the ground and stuffed it into her mouth, the pulpy mass of red and white squelching between her too-sharp teeth.

That’s when I remembered how to breathe.

Movement behind me. Sam’s sharp, heavy breaths hit the back of my neck as he whispered, “Run.”

“Get out of here, Nin,” he hissed, slipping on entrails stuck to the soles of his shoes.

“Fucking run!”

Kaz, still ravaging the corpse of the leader, reacted to Sam’s movement. His neck snapped up, head cocking to the side. 

His eyes were vacant.

Sam stumbled back. He didn't look scared. I wouldn't say it was fear. It was pain. Agony. 

""Fuck."" He said in a sharp breath, his gaze on Kaz. Sam pressed himself against the wall, twisting his head to find an exit. 

""Kaz.”  He held out his hands. “Hey! Kaz, it's me!” 

My housemate’s face was transformed. No longer human, no longer the guy I knew, twisted into something resembling a zombie. 

His eyes were milky white, filled, drenched, overwhelmed with her. 

Every part of him was her, his splintered skin bleeding her, his claws digging into flesh and bone. There was nothing there. 

No ignition in his eyes, nothing to suggest he was a living, breathing human. 

Looking at Rowan, he had the same look, kneeling over the kid’s body, his hands cupping into the cavity in the gut and scooping out glistening gore. 

Imogen, moving from each body with incredible speed, like an animal, her toes primed, slick with pooling red. 

I was still standing there, staring, like a fucking idiot, when the three of them seemed to… change. 

No, that’s not the word. 

As if they operated as a three, they all suddenly got the same thought. 

Kaz stopped mindlessly chewing, a slew of chewed up red mush slipping down his chin. 

Rowan spat out the severed arm he’d been mauling, and Imogen lifted her head, and looked directly at me. 

The other two followed, like they shared a hivemind of some kind, a mind which no longer thought like a human, instead like a feral beast. I would much rather have been ignorant at that moment. I would have happily worn rose tinted glasses. 

Instead though, it began to dawn on me. Looking at what they were feeding on, they weren’t really eating it. Just chewing and spitting it out, or in Rowan’s case, mauling on it like a dog. 

When Imogen slowly got up on primed toes, nostrils flaring, moonlit eyes pinpointing on me, I remembered her words before she surrendered to the moon. *Go upstairs and lock yourself up.* 

And as the three of them began to slowly make their way towards me, like animals cornering prey, I found my gaze going to their so-called meals. None of which they had eaten. Another step. 

They were taking their time, revelling in my scent, moving as a group. 

I could sense their mutual agreement that they were going to share. 

When Rowan made a sound cross between a snarl and a snort, I twisted around and ran. The front door was close, but they already knew my thoughts before I did. They knew my destination before it was in my head. Kaz appeared in front of the door, Rowan and Imogen behind him. 

So, I dived upstairs. 

Again, though, they already knew.

They knew where I was heading. 

Their footsteps followed me, pounding up the stairs, forcing me to kick myself further into a frenzied sprint. 

Their breath tickled the back of my neck, and halfway up the stairs, a hand curled around my leg and yanked. 

I crumpled, losing my grip on the top stair, flailing, and kicking my attacker in the face. 

Kaz.

Faster than the others, a mindless determination glimmered in his eyes, he didn’t stop, didn’t falter, only falling, and getting back up again, crawling up the stairs on all fours. 

As if watching him, the moon seemed to follow, her light pouring from cracks in his face. His arms wrapped around my waist and pulled me halfway down the stairs, and I kicked blindly, only for his grip to loosen, letting me go.

Reaching the top, I followed Immie’s earlier words and threw myself into Rowan’s room, slamming the door behind me and throwing my weight into it. 

But they were already on the other side, hurling themselves into old wood. Fuck. 

Scanning my housemate’s room, I glimpsed his closet. 

They were going to get through. 

Their combined weight was overwhelming, sending me staggering. 

I left the door, lunging into the closet just as they broke through. 

Rowan was first, then Kaz and Imogen. 

When I saw Rowan’s teeth curl back, an animalistic hiss ripping into my ears. 

Rowan dropped onto his knees, rolling around in seeping, pooling moonlight. 

I made awkward eye contact with him, and his head inclined. 

He made a soft noise, and I bit back a hysterical laugh. 

*Yep. Definitely werewolves.*

The closet door was flimsy, barely even a door. 

But something was inside: a large white container my brain didn’t register as a freezer until I yanked it open, finding myself face-to-face with severed pieces of an earlier version of me. 

I didn’t have time to be disgusted. 

Slamming the closet doors shut, or at least trying to shut them as best as I could, I climbed into the freezer, burying myself in my own body parts, and closing the lid shut. 

Sucking in a breath, I waited for them to knock it over, or rip open the lid. Instead though, the three of them didn’t even come in the closet. They knew I was in there. I could hear them clawing at the wood, slamming their weight into it. 

But for some reason they never came in. When I was sure I was safe, I risked letting out a breath. 

And then I was too aware of where I was. What I was enveloped in. I reached out, cringing when I touched my own severed flesh. 

Rowan had cut me into pieces. Probably so I’d last longer. 

My stomach flipped over, and my mouth watered. I was going to throw up. I could feel it, a barf-like paste creeping up my throat. The closet door suddenly flew open, footsteps following. They were in. 

So close. I could hear their heavy pants. Instinctively, my fingers curled around what felt like a slimy piece my torso before something flashed in front of my eyes. A memory from that version of me.

The version they’d murdered and cut up, preserving me in Rowan’s freezer.

This had happened before, I thought dizzily. I’d seen my body’s memories in a sharp blur of colors I could barely focus on.

But this.. this was in clarity. 

Again, I saw everything through her eyes. Unlike the other memory, it was less like I was seeing it, more like I was reliving it. 

The graze of cool night air on my bare skin as I opened up our door to a figure on our doorstep.

*“Oh, hey!”* My own voice was a lot lighter and more energetic. I barely recognised myself. *“You’re…not the pizza guy.”*

“Nin!” Kaz yelled from upstairs. “Did they send extra? My wallet is in my car!”

“Tip them if they're hot!” Imogen shouted, her voice a very drunk slur. 

“It’s not the pizza guy!” I shouted back through a laugh.

It struck me, then, that I didn’t remember this.

This had been part of my blackouts. 

What had been ripped from my memories. 

I felt myself pull away from my body parts, my gut curling at the thought of finally knowing what happened that night. I had to know. 

Even when part of me cringed away, refusing to accept a certain part of myself, I needed to understand the events. 

So, ignoring my body’s insistence to let go, I dug my nails into my own severed flesh, willing myself to delve back into the memory when it started to blur out of focus.  A woman. She was maybe in her late fifties or early sixties with white hair growing grey at the ends. 

Her smile was friendly, and I instantly trusted it.

“Good evening! Would you mind helping me out?” 

I felt the dread building in my current self, as well as in my memory. 

In my memory, however, I ignored the alarm bells.

“Bolivia House, I presume.” The old woman’s smile widened, “It’s just like I remember it.”

Her eyes flicked from the door to me. “I am quite lost.”

“Yeah, of course!” I said, my voice sounded different. Tipsy. I think we were all drunk. “What do you need help with?”

Before the woman could answer, a voice spoke up, and I twisted around. Rowan was standing behind me, halfway through a bag of Cheetos. “Who’s at the door?” He said, through a mouthful of orange mush. 

“Nin, I said don’t talk to strangers.”

Rowan. Part of me splintered. I forgot what he looked like before my blackouts. 

Before he started wearing raybans to hide the effects. 

His eyes used to be warm. Friendly. 

They used to be pretty to look at, a deep shade of brown with flecks of ember like orange. Now I could barely see them anymore. 

They’re almost completely taken over whether he’s possessed or not.

I shoved him, shooting the woman an apologetic look. “It's literally an old woman.” I said through a gritted smile. “Do you want to come in?”

Rowan copied me, grinning through his teeth. “And *what* if she's a psycho murderer?”

The woman cleared her throat. She nodded to Rowan. “Do you and your girlfriend live alone?”

*”Girlfriend?!”* He squawked, choking on Cheeto dust, and I shoved him. Harder. 

Rowan hissed. “That hurt!”

“Go back upstairs. You're drunk and embarrassing yourself.”

“We’re housemates.” I corrected the woman. “There are two more of us!”

“Okay, but whyyyyy do you wanna know?” Rowan pressed his face against the door, attempting to act as *weird* as possible. 

I shoved him again and he fixed her with a not-quite smile, “Are you planning on moving in? We're not an AirB&B, y’know.”

“Goodness, no!” The woman said. “I was just curious! So, four of you, correct?”

Rowan folded his arms. “Why so many questions?” He stepped forward. “Can I question *you*?”

“Rowan.” I warned him. “I’m dealing with it."" 

The woman nodded along, seemingly grateful for me shutting him up. “Thank you.” She said, “Would I be able to come in?”",2,1763261944.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

So I had this idea on Thursday night... I like a few local spots and would love to find out before I head over, which is going be an absolute blast and which will be kinda shitty today.

Not bars, ski mountains.

Not restaurants, surf breaks.

Not coffee shops, beaches.

I threw down my first prompt to ChatGPT on Thursday around 10pm. ""help me build a web app that compares my favorite spots using real data to inform and help pick the best local spot for me to hit up today""...

Friday morning I took the output and shared the idea with Claude, ""take a look and tell me if this is concept would work, identify which data sources to capture, where i can get the data for free and build me a prompt i can share with Claude Code in terminal on my mac so it know exactly what to build"" 

Then I simply opened my terminal, typed in ""claude"" and pasted the prompt.

There was definitely some Iteration and tweaks. 

It started as an idea for 5 ski resorts in Vermont and once I figured out how it would work I just expanded the scope, 

Bought the domain this afternoon (Saturday).

Also Air Temps were fluctuating due to Kalvins, Farenheit and Celsius units being mixed up - 17F water temp and 0F air temp in california at one point in time. The Ai write up for ski spots breaks when I fix teh surf spot write ups too.

1oyahtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1oyahtb/what_is_the_best_smart_plugs_for_voice_control/,What is the best smart plugs for voice control?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been diving deep into home automation lately, and one thing that's made my life way easier is getting the right smart plugs for voice control. I wanted to share what I learned because honestly, not all smart plugs are created equal.

**Why Voice Control Matters**

Being able to tell Alexa or Google Assistant to turn off my coffee maker while I'm still in bed is honestly amazing. No more getting up to flip switches or fumbling with my phone. Voice activated plugs have basically made me feel like I'm living in the future, but without spending a fortune.

**What Makes a Smart Plug Actually Good?**

After trying different brands, here's what matters:

The connection needs to be solid. Nothing's more annoying than yelling at Alexa three times because your wifi smart plug keeps disconnecting.

Response time is huge too. When I say ""turn on the lamp,"" I don't want to wait five seconds wondering if it heard me.

App quality matters even though we're talking about voice control. You'll still need the app for initial setup and schedules.

**My Experience So Far**

I started with cheaper options from random brands on Amazon, and yeah, you get what you pay for. Some worked fine for a few weeks then just stopped responding to voice commands. Others had apps that looked like they were designed in 2010.

The intelligent plugs that actually work well usually come from established brands. They integrate better with Alexa, Google Home, and even Apple HomeKit. Setup takes like five minutes, and they just... work.

**What I'm Using Now**

I've been checking out different options on <a href=""https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs"">this page that compares the best smart plugs</a> for voice control. It breaks down the top-rated ones on Amazon with real user reviews, which helped me avoid the duds.

The ones I ended up getting have energy monitoring too, which is a cool bonus. I can see how much power my window AC unit actually uses and control it with voice commands from anywhere in my apartment.

**Things to Consider Before Buying**

Make sure whatever you get works with your voice assistant. Most support Alexa and Google, but double-check.

Think about outlet size. Some smart plugs are bulky and block both outlets. Get compact ones or look for multi-plug options.

2.4GHz WiFi is usually required. Most don't work with 5GHz networks, which caught me off guard at first.

**Bottom Line**

If you're looking to automate your home without rewiring everything, voice controlled smart plugs are honestly the easiest place to start. They're affordable, simple to install, and actually make daily life more convenient.

I'd recommend checking out <a href=""https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs"">the current deals on quality smart plugs here</a> before buying. Prices change a lot on Amazon, and you can compare features side by side.

Anyone else using smart plugs? What's been your experience with voice control reliability?",1,1763261443.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False
1oyagbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/veritynews/comments/1oyagbb/trump_cuts_tariffs_on_over_200_food_products/,🚨🇺🇸🍽️ TRUMP CUTS TARIFFS ON OVER 200 FOOD PRODUCTS,"**Republican narrative**: Trump delivers immediate relief to American families by slashing tariffs on essential food items, showing that he is serious about lowering everyday costs for Americans. His overarching policy is about strengthening America’s negotiating leverage, and selective adjustments prove he’s willing to be flexible where it directly helps consumers. Real wages will finally increase as Trump fixes the affordability mess left by failed policies. 

**Democratic narrative**: Trump's tariff reversal exposes years of lies about who actually pays these taxes — American consumers, not foreign countries, as repeatedly claimed. These tariffs artificially inflated grocery prices to fund billionaire tax cuts while ordinary families suffered at checkout.

I’m talking bushy tail, hissing,growling,SCREAMING the works he absolutely did NOT like her, but she loves him she wants to play and doesn’t seem to get that he wants her dead. We were able to get separate stuff today(overdraft is great) but I think the damage is done he won’t stop growling at my fiancé(not sure why) or the kitten. He’s fine with me as long as the kitten isn’t near me but my biggest problem is he attacked my fiancé earlier, I’m talking blood splatter on the floor, rug, coffee table everything and it was just out of nowhere he was acting fine and laying with him on the ground not even near the kitten and just started attacking. My fiancé wants to get rid of him now for it or said we could just let the kitten go. I just want to know how I can make him calm down and get along.",1,1763261191.0,PetAdvice,13,1.0,False

1oyaeab,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1oyaeab/aio_for_thinking_my_girlfriend_is_kinda_toxic/,AIO for thinking my girlfriend is kinda toxic?,"This morning we had an apartment tour at 9:45. Around 8:30, my girlfriend suddenly said she had a “quick 10-minute” work task she had to do right now. I asked if it really needed to be done immediately since the deadline was Monday, and she insisted yes because she needed someone’s approval before then. It ended up taking about 30 minutes, so we didn’t get the coffee/food we’d planned.

As we left for the tour, she asked if I was upset. I said yes, because it felt like she could’ve done it later instead of making me wait. The first thing she brought up was how she wasn’t upset that one time I had to work on her birthday. (For context, that was a weekday, I actually had a same-day deadline, and we still made it to our dinner reservation on time.) That already felt like deflection.

After a bit of back and forth, she admitted she could have done the work later but didn’t want to procrastinate and be stressed all day. I said that felt dishonest, and she got upset at me for using the word “lie,” and things spiraled from there.

Later at home, I tried to talk calmly. I apologized for using the word lie since I know it’s loaded for her, but said it still felt like I wasn’t told the full truth. I also said the argument felt like “escalation after escalation,” and pointed out that when I told her I was upset, she immediately brought up my working on her birthday instead of hearing me out. She told me that the way I was describing things made it sound like I wanted an argument. She insisted she hadn’t escalated anything and that the only issue was me calling her a liar.

I brought up something similar from a few days earlier: during another argument she told me it felt like I don’t care about her or think about her, and later that night said she didn’t know or couldn’t remember the last time she felt cared about. Today she said she didn’t say that, then said she didn’t remember, and later said she remembers the conversation but didn’t “explicitly” say those exact words. When I asked if she believes me that she still said she couldn’t remember the last time she felt I cared about her, she said, “I believe that’s how you remember hearing it.”

That honestly messed with my head.

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. Whenever I bring something up, she gets defensive, brings up unrelated things, or denies/minimizes what she said, and focuses on wording instead of the meaning. I end up feeling like the unreasonable one and questioning my own memory.

I haven’t spoken to her the rest of the day because I’m drained and honestly scared to bring anything up at this point.

1oyae0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobloxMyths/comments/1oyae0c/need_help_finding_an_old_myth_game_might_not_be/,Need help finding an old myth game (might not be idk),"So the other day, I was on a call with one of my long-time friends, and the topic of Roblox came up. We talked about the ""good old days"" when we'd play Roblox during lockdown, and she brought up various myth games we used to play. Keep in mind, we were no older than 12-14 at the time of lockdown (2019-2021), so my memory is kind of fuzzy with remembering what we played exactly, but being 18 now, I suggested we revisit some of those games we played to see if we would find more hidden meanings in certain games we originally thought were just ""creepy"" or ""weird"".

It started with the Double R Bar, where we'd watch people talk about politics and religion, and that was our first ""niche"" and ""edgy"" game. We made a few questionable friends, one of whom introduced us to more obscure myth games like Mind Murder Place, OneDayThingsChange, and a few others I also can't really remember T\_T.

The game I'm trying to find, though, I remember certain parts very distinctly, and I want to see if anyone can help me find it.

From what I remember (pls note that some of it might be wrong because I might mix up bits and pieces from other myth games), the main setting was in a hotel. There was a functioning elevator and certain items you could interact with that would give a caption, like pop-up text that probably alluded to a story that was within a game. The lobby had couches and a loft with a library. There were NPCs that would only give one or two sentence dialogues when interacted with, and I remember a middle-aged woman in the lounge area and a grandpa in the library. I specifically remember the loft having coffee tables and chairs placed by the railing, and that's where the grandpa was seated. I also remember an apple (for whatever reason, idk if it was interactable). The elevators would bring you to a different floor, and you could explore the hotel; I think the higher you got, the more anomalies you would find throughout the hotel, like a monster being in the pool room (of which I remember not being able to hurt you), and most rooms not being able to be used. I don't remember if there were entities that could attack you, but I'm guessing there weren't because my friend and I wouldn't play games where we'd die from something too often..

Other than that, I think certain objects would either connect you to different experiences linked to the main game or teleport you to a different part of the map. One room in particular was an optical illusion room with white and black checkered floors and walls. I think there was a big dip in it with a big ball having the same pattern.

The game had a rustic, antique look to it, and the graphics and attention to detail in the game were exceptionally good compared to other games, but still had a blocky feel to it, ykwim? Like, the NPCs looked half-rendered in a kinda situation, but otherwise it was really nice. You couldn't sprint, crouch, or go into any other F/POV.  
The topic has been on my mind for a week now, and it's lowkey been driving me nuts. It's a silly thing to think about, as I definitely have better things to be worrying about, but I just wanted to know if anyone else remembered or knew of this game.

1oyacbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaterFilters/comments/1oyacbb/ecofriendly_plumbing_solutions_cleaner_water_and/,Eco-Friendly Plumbing Solutions: Cleaner Water and Lower Waste Throughout Your Home,"Installing A whole house water filter is one of the most effective ways to improve water quality in your home. While many households focus only on drinking water filters, untreated water can impact every area of daily life, including showers, laundry, cooking, and appliances. By installing [A whole house water filter](https://www.purewater4life.com.au/wholehousefilters), you ensure that all taps in your home deliver clean, safe, and fresh water, improving comfort, health, and the longevity of plumbing systems and household appliances.

https://preview.redd.it/1hb04s328j1g1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f0ee20a7a81d8c14d06989f02b7f3648cae9f7c

Why Whole-Home Water Filtration is Essential

Water is an essential part of everyday life, yet untreated water often contains chlorine, sediment, rust, organic compounds, and chemicals that can affect:

•           Skin and hair health

•           Laundry appearance and longevity

•           Appliance performance and lifespan

•           Plumbing efficiency

•           Taste and quality of food and beverages

With A whole house water filter, water is treated at the point of entry, providing consistent quality across every tap. Unlike small filters that target only drinking water, a whole-home system protects your entire household.

Healthier, Gentler Showers

Chlorine and chemicals in unfiltered water can irritate skin, strip natural oils, and leave hair dry and brittle. Hot water can intensify these effects, making daily showers uncomfortable.

By installing A whole house water filter, you’ll notice:

•           Softer, gentler showers and baths

•           Reduced skin irritation and dryness

•           Healthier, more manageable hair

•           Chlorine-free water for a comfortable shower experience

•           Safe water for children and sensitive individuals 

Filtered water transforms your shower from a routine into a relaxing, nourishing experience.

Better Water for Cooking and Drinking

Even if a separate drinking water filter is used, cooking with untreated water can negatively impact taste, safety, and hygiene. Chlorine, chemicals, and sediment can alter the flavour and quality of meals.

A whole house water filter ensures:

•           Clean, fresh water for cooking and boiling

•           Chemical-free water for washing fruits and vegetables

•           Improved taste in tea, coffee, and other beverages

•           Safe, high-quality water for all culinary application 

Filtered water enhances every meal and drink, improving health and enjoyment for the entire family.

Softer, Brighter Laundry

Water quality has a direct effect on laundry. Chlorine and minerals in unfiltered water can fade colours, stiffen fabrics, and reduce detergent effectiveness. Hard water can also lead to scaling in washing machines over time.

With A whole house water filter, you’ll enjoy:

•           Softer, cleaner clothes

•           Brighter, longer-lasting fabrics

•           Reduced detergent usage

•           Extended washing machine lifespan

Filtered water ensures your clothes remain vibrant and fresh while protecting your appliances.

Protecting Appliances and Plumbing

Sediment, rust, and debris in water can accumulate in pipes and appliances, causing blockages, reduced efficiency, and costly repairs. Installing A whole house water filter prevents these issues, protecting your home’s infrastructure.

Filtered water safeguards:

•           Hot water systems and boilers

•           Washing machines and dishwashers

•           Coffee machines, kettles, and ice makers

•           Pipes, taps, and irrigation systems

This protection reduces maintenance costs, extends appliance life, and keeps your home running smoothly.

Suitable for Mains and Rainwater Systems

Australia has diverse water sources, including mains and rainwater tanks. A whole house water filter is engineered to handle both effectively.

For mains water:

•           Reduces chlorine, chemicals, and odours

•           Improves taste and clarity

•           Protects plumbing and appliances

For rainwater:

•           Removes sediment, debris, and organic matter

•           Improves water clarity and safety

•           Provides clean water for all household uses

Filtered water ensures consistent quality across all taps, regardless of the source.

Maintenance and Long-Term Benefits

Maintaining A whole house water filter is simple. Sediment filters typically require replacement every 3–6 months, carbon filters every 6–12 months, and specialty filters according to usage. Regular maintenance ensures optimal performance and longevity.

Key advantages include:

•           Clean, safe water at every tap

•           Softer showers and healthier hair and skin

•           Brighter, longer-lasting laundry

•           Reduced plumbing and appliance issues

•           Greater comfort, convenience, and efficiency in your home

Conclusion: A Valuable Investment for Every Home

Investing in A whole house water filter is one of the most practical upgrades you can make for your home. From softer showers and cleaner laundry to better-tasting water and protected appliances, the benefits are extensive. Every tap delivers fresh, clean, and safe water, creating a healthier, more comfortable, and enjoyable environment for your entire family.

■Start■

[The episode starts of with a voice tell the viewers about a myth]

A Voice: Beware the Black cat. That myth has been spread down for many years. A black cat that spreads misfortune, pain and bad luck, to anyone that crosses its path. Beware the black cat, it’ll haunt you if you don't heed the warning. Beware the black cat. A single hair will curse you for all your days. 

That's what kids used to say. But of course as all myths there are never true, nobody actually believed this. But what if it was true? 
What if all the stories that others have been saying manifested into the actual curse for the black cat.
And what the cat knows is that it's cursed with bad luck, and doesn't know how to stop itself from causing pain.
It truly is a pity for anyone she tries to get close to. Oh Little black cat, Even though you can't hear me, hopefully you'll learn that life will always exist and life will always have a bit of calamity within itself.

Punk 2: That's so smart I should do that when I'm at the cash register.

Punk 3: being at the cash register has its benefits huh?

Micheal: Cereal, Milk, Turkey, Candy, Candy. Candy.. Why is candy written on the list so much? Whatever I guess I could give the kids what they want, [Continues walking down the aisles]

[As Micheal walks thru the store he keeps hearing 2 sets of footsteps behind him]

[Micheal hearing footsteps he turns around and sees nobody behind him]

Micheal: huh, for a second I thought somebody was right behind me,

[Micheal continues walking down the aisle]

[Behind Micheal are 2 small foxes with dirty looking clothes and masks on them looking at Micheal]

Red Fox: [shakes nervously] 

Yellow fox: You almost got us caught you Idiot. Control your breathing. And watch how you step, that's how you're gonna alert them.

Red Fox: I'm sorry I've never stolen from someone before like you.

Yellow fox:  we gotta do this to survive, I'm getting tired of eating food from the garbage.. so go on [pushes Red Fox forward] go and steal their wallet.

Red Fox: Why does it have to be me? You’re usually the thief outta the 3 of us

Yellow fox: You gotta learn how to steal one day. This skill will be helpful in the future. Now go on and steal that man's wallet.

Red Fox: Okay okay, just give me a second.

[The Red Fox continues to follow Micheal around the store to attempt on stealing their wallet]

[The Red Fox eventually figures out what pocket Micheal’s wallet is in, Red Fox Gets on top of a shelf and reaches for Micheal’s wallet and steals it]

Red Fox: I did it, I cant believe that i really did it.

[Micheal turns around because he heard someone talking and sees Red Fox with his wallet]

Micheal: Hey That My Wallet!!

Red Fox: Eeh?? [a little shocked that he got caught]

Yellow fox: YOU DUMBIE, WHO STEALS SOMETHING AND CONGRATULATES THEMSELVES THAT THEY STOLE SOMETHING!?

Red Fox: [screams and proceeds to run] SORRY MISTER!!

Yellow fox: [currently running] If we get outta this unscathed we seriously have to talk about you’re “talking to yourself” problem!

Red Fox:[currently running] Im Sorry It's a Habit i can't get rid out!  {whimpers} 

[Both the foxes Get chased all over the store, after a while They lead Micheal to an aisle, and and when Micheal gets to the end of the aisle he trips upon an shopping cart passing by that appeared out of nowhere]

Micheal: {Gets up and groans, Looks left.. Looks right.. Micheal lost the foxes} Son of a bi-

Yellow fox: BIIIIIIGGG Money

Red Fox: [catches there breath]

[location outside the store]
[Time 9:15AM]

Yellow fox: You know what this means? No more eating out the trash for the time being. We can actually eat decent food for a while.

Red Fox: {pants} This was a terrible idea. we’re gonna get in trouble and when we do i hope your ready for what punishment she has in store for us.

Yellow fox: Oh please she not gonna find out about what we did.

Black cat: Hmm?

{The black cats presents scared both the foxs. Yellow fox hides the wallet within there tail.]

{Both foxes got scared straight}

Red Fox: Hiiii.. how is everything going for you?

Black cat: Great {Smiles} there was this lady that gave me a peanut butter sandwich. here
{Gives the sandwich to Red Fox} 

Red Fox:{they smile and there tail start swinging} 

Yellow fox: You actually had a good interaction with someone? seems unlikely 

Black cat: {stays Silence for a bit} You know maybe If I do interact with more people they could actually help me with you two being hungry constantly.

Yellow fox: I thought you hated people.

Black cat: Not all people are bad, but it's hard to find the good ones

Red fox: Well you made a friend and that friend gave us some food. [before Red Fox can take a bite a bird swoops the sandwich and flies away] HEY!?

[The bird landed on a part of the electric pole wire that was a bit ripped. and the bird got electrocuted. The bird being burned falls into the parking lot along with the sandwich]

Red fox: Hey The sandwich seems to be fine, in fact it might be better sense it's cooked.

[The bird and the sandwich slowly get run over by a car pulling out from the parking lot, The black cat puts their hands over their mouth in shock. The yellow fox covers their ears so they wouldn't hear the crunch from the bird’s bones, and the red Fox covers there eyes so they wouldn't see the death]

Red Fox: {turns to Yellow fox and black cat} How come whenever i have any happiness it gets stripped away in a matter of seconds. 
[Tears start to form]

Yellow fox: It's the mystery of life.

Black cat: uhhh.. I'll find something else for you to, just dont lose hope. [Bends down to wipe the tears off Red Fox]

Red Fox: what about you?

Emily: I'll be fine so don't worry [smiles and pets Red Fox and leaves]

Red Fox: But I am.

Yellow fox: It'll be alright. with this wallet. We’ll be providing the food for a while. Just imagine the look on her face when we come back to her with food

Red Fox: [Gasps] She'd be so happy. Wait Do you even have a plan of how we can fool Her into thinking we didn't steal any of said food?

Yellow fox: I'm so glad you asked my little servant. And the plan is What if we happen to “stubble upon the money together” she’ll think some poor fool lost there wallet. {smirks}

Jessie: What were you thinking? Buying a BB gun.

Milo: Bold of you to assume I was “thinking”

Jessie: [Angrily sighs] I Got bigger problems to worry about. Where is your father? He didn't come pick me up and I thought he forgot, so I had to take the bus, and I see that the car wasn't parked in the garages driveway.

Ollie: He’s not with you?

Red Fox: okay.. but what about the wallet stuffed in your tail, what do with the wallet and cards? [Points two Yellow fox tail]

Jessie: They got blown in the wind. If you can just give me more time

Pacifica: I gave you a reasonable amount of time and yet you still failed this task. Jessie, you used to be a great employee here at Red ink. But you're no longer in your prime. Maybe it's time to toss in the towel darling.

Red Fox: yeah aren't you happy Emily?

Black cat [Emily]: Do you think I'm stupid?

Yellow fox: no? 

Black cat [Emily]: 500 dollars is an outrageous amount of money to just wind up in the garbage can. I saw and heard what you have done and frankly I'm disappointed. I told yall no stealing. And you disobeyed me.

[Both the foxes stay silent]

Black cat [Emily]: [Looks at the little foxes] now where is that wallet you stole.

[Both of the foxes have nervous and horrified faced expressions]

Jessie: those foxes got the Jump on me okay

Micheal: sounds like they took your pride as well.

Jessie: They took more than my pride, they took my job along with them.

Tom: Why are we sitting here at a table shouldn't we go back out there and find more documents?

Jessie: No point, Even with the 3 of us we only found 80 documents that just so happen to be in the city. It's over, I've lost my job.

[A moment of silence]

[Somebody comes inside the fast food restaurant, That somebody goes to the table Jessie is sitting at and hands them something, hands them the documents]

Jessie: What the?

Tom: these are the remaining documents 

Micheal: All 320 of them?

[Jessie looks at the person with handed the documents and sees that it's the Homeless cat girl she gave the sandwich two]

Jessie: It's you. [Says shockingly]

Micheal: You know this little girl?

Jessie: … When I was running to work I met this girl as she was rummaging around in a trash can, I gave her a peanut butter sandwich and she went on her merry way. I don't know why she felt the need to collect the each document though
[Takes the documents from Emily]

Emily: [Looks at both Micheal and Jessie] I-

[Emily hands Micheal his wallet]

Micheal: Is that my wallet? [Grabs it]

Emily: You lost your 500 dollars right? Don't worry they didn't spend anything. 

[Micheal Check his wallet to see if she's telling the truth, which she was.]

Emily: I've told them they shouldn't steal from others but I guess they didn't want to listen. What do you 2 have to say for yourselves  [Looks at Both the foxes]

Both foxes: We're sorry.

Red Fox: We've been on the street for so long. We haven't had good food in so long.

Yellow fox: We just wanted a taste of something good okay?

Emily: [Still mad but understands their feelings] I understand you're tired but you almost cost these people there home? You would have made them homeless as well? 
Do you really want that on your conscience?

Both foxes: No..

Jessie: Wait You 3 are all homeless? But you 3 look so young. Where are your parents?

[A moment of silence]

Red Fox: Well our parents gave up us for adoption. but nobody wanted us, and Emily.. 

Emily: … Gone. [Her eyes look so dead]

[Silence]

Emily: we've been homeless for a while now, it's just how it is.

[Micheal and Jessie look at each other]

Jessie: Tom can you take these documents and place them on the manager desk and tell her i have “Family matters to take care of”

Tom: “Family matters?” [Looks at Emily] Oh I understand. I’ll take care of it for you.

[Tom leaves to deliver the documents]

Micheal: [Looks at Red Fox] Hey you stole my wallet because you wanted a decent meal right?

Red Fox: [Scared] Yes..

Micheal: Well Let me treat you to one. [Pulls out money from the wallet]

[Both foxes' ears perk up and smile while Emily is a bit shocked. The foxes are given burgers and they start Devouring the food]

Jessie: I don't think they're chewing, I think they're just inhaling the food.

Yellow fox: [Starts choking]

Micheal: Slow down are you okay?

Yellow fox: [Nods]

[Emily looks at her burger and slides the plate towards Red Fox and yellow fox]

Yellow fox: Ahh.

[Yellow fox pushes the plate back toward Emily, angrily]

Yellow fox: You need to eat as well

Emily: Hmm I thought I told you I'm fine.
Besides you two seem to be enjoying that burger.

Red Fox: Exactly, We already have a burger. So you don't have to worry about feeding us.

[Emily remains quiet]

Jessie: you know, I have a feeling that the reason they stole our wallet wasn't just to feed themselves but to also feed you.

[Emily being a little shocked by her words she looked at the foxes]

Red Fox: you tell us not to worry and I'll worry for you Emily, but you do these things that only make me worry more. I haven't seen you eat a meal in so long.

Yellow fox: He's right it's been a while since we all ate a meal together. 

[Emily smiles at them and decides to pick up the burger and take a bite, her pupils began to dilate and got bigger]

Emily: Thank you 2 for caring so much. [Got a little Ketchup on her face and wipes it off]

Jessie: So what are your names

Emily: I'm Emily. The Red fox is Clover and the Yellow fox is Daisy. 

Jessie: And You must really care for them huh.

Emily: I do, they mean a lot to me.

I’ve had my Ninja Luxe Cafe for about 6 months and we love it but I’m still perfecting a luxe basket brew on both the espresso and cold press setting. If anyone has a really good general method nailed down please share in the comments. I know results will vary slightly based on what espresso I use but I do take into consideration the age based on each individual brew. For this instance, consider that I’m using very freshly roasted espresso (roasted 11/11, today is 11/15, waiting a couple more days for them to age before using). The specific roast is Ultraviolet (grown in Colombia & Etheopia) from Nightswim Coffee out of South Carolina if anyone is interested.

1oyaa0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultKids/comments/1oyaa0k/i_blocked_my_parents_yesterday/,I blocked my parents yesterday.,"Hi, 33f. 
As the title says, it all happened yesterday and right now I just feel...drained. 

Ive kept my parents at arms length for most of my adult life, I knew our relationship wasn't normal but our whole family is conditioned to believe that family is everything and you cant turn your back on them. 

Its been...a rough 2 months for me. I just have a lot of personal things going on and have been stressed. I haven't talked to my parents about it because as I said earlier I try to keep things short and surface level to avoid conflict, guilt tripping, or possibly something I dont want others knowing to be suddenly floating around the whole fucking town. 

Yesterday I left work early because of a lot of BS happening at the company. I was stressed about it to the point of tears. I went and got coffee at my favorite shop and then had lunch with my partner. During lunch my mom texted me, ""Hi, Midknight. Love you!"" 

Tbh, I just really didnt feel like talking. I knew if I responded she would call and I'd be on the phone with her. I didn't want to talk about what was going on which would mean the conversation would be too short for her and she'd just complain that I never talk to her (she always guilt trips me for this). I ignored the message and continued my lunch. 

I got home and cleaned the house for a couple hours, then I started prepping dinner because we were having people over for a game night. I needed it, I wanted to be with friends and laugh. I'm peeling potatoes when she calls me. Ignoring the call after ignoring the text would just cause more shit so I answered. Convo as follows: 

Mom: hi, what are you doing?
Me: im just cooking dinner right now.
Mom: I texted you earlier 
Me: yeah I saw, i was really busy today
Mom: Oh...*click*

She hung up on me. 5 minutes later my dad shows up. I knew what was coming. I told our roommate to open the door. I had a witness, theres no going back on this, my partner was unfortunately still at work. I was on my own in terms of standing up for myself. 

My dad came in to berate me about not calling my mother. That she told him I was too busy to talk to her and he said I should never be too busy to talk to family. Screaming, spitting, pointing fingers. Typical. I tell him to get out of my house because I refuse to be spoken to like that in my own home. He tells me its not my house its [partner]'s house. So I reach for my phone. He accuses me of trying to call the police on him, I told him no, im calling [partner].

He gives me a look of disgust and asks what do you think he's going to do? I put the phone down and tell him to leave now. He starts trying to gas light me, telling me ""oh you guys had a real bad childhood didnt you? You went to disney and Arizona every year, what a tought fucking childhood. Your'e spoiled brats""

He then tells me I need to call my mother or else. Or else what oh father of mine? You going to hit me like you used to? Going to berate and belittle me? Why dont you go ahead and take my door off again. GET OUT, I scream it from the deepest pit in my soul. 

Call your mother because she gave birth to you, you owe us. No I dont because YOU made the choice to have me. Why is your choice hung over my head constantly? Birthing me is first fucking step for having a kid. 

As hes walking out the door he tells me ""I hope you dont have kids because they'd be fucking miserable with a mother like you. Youre incapable of love. Go fuck yourself"" 

Im incapable of love? Me? 
No love to you is submission. Love to you is staying quiet and doing what you're told. Love to you is never questioning authority and being punished if you do. You think I'm incapable of love because I'm not going to lay down and let you talk to me like this ever again.

I immediately started crying when he left. My roommate couldnt believe what he just heard. My partner was furious when he got home. I blocked them. I finally blocked them. I need strength for the months and years to come because I know they will be talking about their ungrateful, cowardly and hateful daughter. They'll send the other family members to guilt trip me. They might come back to my house considering we only live 10 min away. 

I feel so tired. I feel like my spirit has withered away. I dont know...I feel really hollow right now. And my dad's words telling me I'm incapable of love cuts a little too deep. My siblings are on my side, they all went through their own forms of abuse and they deal with our parents in their own way. I dont think anyone expected me, the ""good"" daughter, to be the first to cut it all off. 

Thanks for sticking around to read. 

Edit: after re-reading I should maybe add some context for why I blocked my mother too. This isn't the first time she's sent our dad after us. She used to tell him when we hurt her feelings, or disobeyed and would stand by and watch as my dad screamed at us and hit us. My mother has given my sister a black eye. She once grabbed me so hard as a child I bled from her nails digging into my skin. She is not innocent. 

My dad once threw my sisters phone at her when she was 16. It cut her cheek open right under her eye. My mom called me crying because she was worried her husband would go to jail if my sister talked. She wasnt worried about the fact that her daughter had to get stitches on her face because ""she needed to learn a lesson""",20,1763260800.0,EstrangedAdultKids,7,0.92,False

I’m 18 and I just went away to college in another state and I can’t seem to make any friends. I meet people and I’ve become so desperate for connection that I’ll invite people I talked to once for coffee in hopes of making a friend. I try so hard but no one invites me anywhere.

My year started out fine. Before school started, I was hanging out with these girls I met at orientation pretty consistently. Then I stopped getting invited and they continued to hang out. I was fine with it because I felt like maybe they just stopped inviting me because it was more convenient since they both live on campus and I don’t. Anyways, I started hanging with one of my roommates all the time. We would do everything together, but once she joined her sorority and got her big, she stopped acknowledging me. I text her and she would never respond. To make matters worse, no one at home seems to care about me. I really only had one best friend from back home and I tried to text her consistently because I wanted to stay close. I wanted to have weekly facetimes etc. like I saw everyone else doing, but she would take forever to respond: anywhere from 2-5 days, which was nothing like her. This was discouraging, so I gave up reaching out because I’m so so tired of begging for people to care about me. I met up with those girls from orientation again and I told them about my roommate and how I was struggling, so they planned another thing with me then they forgot about it. I’m constantly alone and have no one to do anything with. Last week, I went to a concert by myself because I couldn’t find anyone to go with me.

I feel like the more time I’m alone the less I recognize myself. Lately when I’ve been in my clubs I’ve felt like I don’t even have a personality anymore and I’m shyer than I’ve ever been before because I’m afraid of doing the wrong thing and people not liking me. They already don’t think I’m interesting now, so I’ve felt like I need to change myself.

I apologize for this being so scattered, but it kind of all culminated this week when I was looking for apartments and realized I have absolutely no one to lease with. I reached out to those girls from orientation and they already had a lease together. I completely understand that but it made me think back to how they just stopped inviting me and how angry I am with people being fine without my presence. I’m just so angry at people right now. All my life, I’ve always been the friend that has to beg to be included. I might care too much or be too sensitive, but I don’t think I’m asking too much for just one person to value me. I’m tired of this world and how no one gives a damn about me. I’m lost and I don’t see a way out. I’m heartbroken by how I’ve been treated by my friends my whole life and I don’t see it ever changing. ",2,1763260659.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

- M 27-35

- To prevent cultural clashes, I am strictly looking for East / Southeast Asian men. Sorry. 

- doesn’t smoke, or at least not regularly 

- someone who lives either within the city or willing to travel as I can’t travel as easily myself

- must be ok with large dogs. I have a 60-pound American Bully (which is why I can’t travel as easily)

- a chill friendship-first connection that will hopefully eventually lead to a stable long term relationship. I’m not itching to get married or anything and super down to just be friends if we ended up not clicking in a romantic way. 

About me:

- immigrant from Southeast Asia

- pretty tall at 5’ 7”. I don’t care about your height, but you might care about mine. Yes, I do wear heels occasionally.

- I don’t drink :( sorry! I don’t mind if you do, though

- mostly a homebody with couch potato vibes at my core, but with an adventurous streak that comes out some weekends and longer holidays :) let’s explore and travel and try new things! 

- an OG weeb! Talk anime to me ✨

- fake gamer. Watches lots of YouTube playthroughs without actually ever playing the games 😬 but still, talk gaming to me! 

- I also love movies, coffee, nature trails, trashy reality TV, trying new food, J-Pop (I sing!), and literature :) I used to read real books, but I mostly stick with children’s picture books now 😅 for work. Oh, and I used to shoot arrows!

When we first met, I wasn’t working either because I was in a really bad place mentally and literally couldn’t get out of bed for months. But I’ve been working for a while now and getting back on my feet.

Meanwhile, I’m paying for basically everything. I buy his basic stuff like shampoo and deodorant, I pay for our dog, and if he wants something and I say no he gets upset and then asks his parents instead. For example: morning coffee. 

He sleeps in all the time, plays video games all day, and I have to wake him up over and over every morning (I’m saying at least 10 times.) He still has my card on his Xbox even though I’ve told him to remove it, and they keep charging my account every month.

He doesn’t have a car either, so he uses mine. I cover gas, insurance, everything. He told me the other day that he “filled up my tank,” and he acted like he did something huge. When I checked, he barely put anything in. I hate to sound greedy, It’s not about the gas, it just feels like he wants credit for doing the bare minimum while I’m carrying everything else.

I love him, but I’m so drained. I feel like I’m taking care of someone who refuses to take care of himself. I don’t even know how to bring this up without it turning into a fight. Has anyone been through something like this? What did you do?

The most recent review on Google complimented the staff’s kindness and creativity, something the owner and returning manager clearly don’t value.

They posted on their social media they’re closed for barista training.

*The ER was a desert that night—wide, humming, fluorescent, and utterly devoid of humanity. A rare and dangerous calm. The nurses lurked at their stations like gunfighters between saloon brawls, sipping stale coffee and pretending not to enjoy the silence. Even the monitor alarms seemed to have taken the night off, leaving behind a low electrical buzz that passed for peace in this madhouse.

I sat at the physician desk, twirling a pen like a man who didn’t trust the universe. Because you can never trust the universe. Not in emergency medicine. The very moment you start to savor the stillness—that is when the gods of chaos notice you.

And I was savoring it. Oh, hell yes. My charting was done, the board was empty, and the whole department was mine, a fluorescent cathedral lit for a single parishioner. I leaned back, cracked my neck, felt the rare high of knowing I hadn’t yet been asked to shove a tube into someone’s throat or divine the cause of their abdominal mysticism.

But the clock ticked like a warning. Any second, the doors could burst open with a bleeding drunk, a cardiac time-bomb, or a family of seven all struck by the same mysterious plague. In the ER, tranquility is never the mood—only the setup. The punchline always arrives by ambulance.

So I sat there in the eerie quiet, basking in the moment like a condemned man enjoying his last cigarette, fully aware that somewhere out there, trouble was revving its engine and checking the address.

It would find us. It always does. But until then, the silence was golden, the coffee lukewarm, and for one fleeting, treacherous moment, the ER felt almost human.*",5,1763260173.0,emergencymedicine,10,0.58,False

We came here for 3 weeks to discover a bit of the country and see if we'd like to move here next year.

We both work remotely (entrepreneur and freelancer) and would be coming under DTV visas around Summer 2026.

I've personally been living in different countries (Spain, USA, Madagascar, Belgium, Germany, Kyrgyzstan), and I speak 5-6 languages, and I'm committed to learning Thai, just like I learned the languages everywhere I went and lived, knowing that it will be hard but I have a track of record of living somewhere and learning the language (even Russian, which was the hardest).

We're not into shopping, luxury, or crazy nightlife. We're into: 

* Nature and Parks (and we love seeing green in the streets).
* Specialty coffee - the nerdiest part of third-wave coffee. Already met a few baristas to geek out with in Terroir recently. Looking to expand on that and make connections in the coffee industry.
* Playing ultimate frisbee and going to the gym. I've seen the soidawgz ultimate frisbee team and I'll find some community there.
* Building local community, creating cool projects to bring people together.
* Playing board games.
* Plants and reading.
* Shopping in day ""farmers markets"" for plant-based food, as we're both vegan and like to cook. We really enjoy markets.
* Creating and launching projects and doing cool shit.

Here's a list of things we're looking for in Bangkok, and would love your tips and pointers:

1. A neighborhood/area to live with a vibrant community with a strong social fabric, who generally stick around, vs a neighborhood of short-term stays (a few months) where people come and go all the time. We still don't know where we'd like to live and are likely to rent a few Airbnb's for a month/two when we come to discover different areas.
   1. Ideally, also neighborhoods where we can access a lot of things by walking. Since we walk remotely and don't commute, we'd love to be able to come to a market, a gym, and some nice cafés within ""walking distance"".
2. Clubs, groups, or organizations doing anything related to what we posted that we like above.
3. Tips from people who've established a nice community for themselves in Bangkok.
4. Any other things you think we should know that we potentially missed in our research.

  
As for our budget, we're looking at around 24-30k baht for a 2-bedroom apartment (so we can set up an office).

As far as I can remember as a child, I wanted a nice beard when I became an adult. While some Koreans can grow beards, Korean guys facial hair game is generally lacking especially when compared to Middle Eastern guys. But I have noticed in recent years, many more Korean guys can grow nice facial hair compared to past years.

  
Even up to my last twenties, I could only muster a few hairs and whiskers in my chin area and below the nose area. Most other Korean American guys could at least grow a goatee.

  
What changed for me was trying to gain muscle mass and the journey through that process. In my late twenties, I was very slim and my height was height (5'10""). No matter what I ate, I could not gain muscles.  Even after taking in lots of protein, my muscle growth plateaued.  I did a lot of research and read books and the insight that allowed me to gain muscle was the knowledge of alkaline forming foods and acid forming foods.

  
In most modern diets (processed foods), the diet is very acid forming.  And because of this, our PH of our body is higher than normal. This prevents optimal nutrient absorption.

Once I was able to control and adjust for this, I started gaining muscles and at last my facial hair came in.  And I didn't even eat much protein (just a serving a day). It took about two years for me to get a nice beard. It was a surprise because I thought it was purely genetics.   
I also grew like half inch after this and my skin became very clear. My guess is that my spinal discs became more hydrated and the alkaline blood helped all the toxins clear out.



I won't go over every detail of whats acid forming or not, there are many books and online websites on this topic. I will give a basic overview here:

1. Processed foods are generally more acid forming than fresh foods
2. Fresh vegetables and fruits are generally alkaline forming
3. Lemon (despite being acidic) is very alkaline forming. That is why fresh lemon juice is used as an internal cleanser 
4. Some fruits can be acid forming like blueberries, but despite that, you should still eat them several times a week because they have lots of other health benefits
5. Vinegar and most forms of dressing (mustard, Ketchup) are very acid forming
6. Coffee is acid forming
7. Most Grains are acid forming
8. Meats are acid forming when combined with starches. But if just eaten with vegetables, they are some where in the middle. Shell fish is always acid forming regardless.
9. Fermented vegetables, especially things like 김치 and 깍두기 and all the other assortments of fermented Korean side dishes are acid forming. But there are benefits to these because they have pro-biotics and such.  된장찌개 has lots of vitamin K2 that are needed for your body. 



Aside from foods, what else acidifies your body:

1. Anger and extreme emotional distress. Learn to manage your relationships.
2. Exercise in immediate term because of lactic acid generation, but obviously you should exercise since it will improve oxygenation of the blood and help your body rid of acid in the long run.

What alkalizes your body:

1. Exercise in the long term, since your body get better circulation and breathing to remove all that acid.
2. Deep breathing. The removal of Co2 removes the acids from your body
3. Deep Meditation. 
4. Drinking lots of clean water will de-acidify your body when you urinate the acid out.
5. Fresh air, Sunlight, Earthing and negative ions. I'm not a chemist but if someone can explain why people say this work and it does from my experience, that would be great. Acids are electron receiver while Bases are electron donors?
6. Alkaline water machines - These were the rage in the 2000s to 2010s in Japan and in Korea. Many of these machines are actually made by Korean companies.  But these are expensive and while they can be helpful, they can also do too much alkalinity. Too much alkalinity is worse than too much acidity. I think drinking 1 cup daily of alkaline water from these machines can be good for Korean parents who refuse to change their diet away from all those Korean side dishes. Be careful here, the alkaline water will make medication far more absorbent and if your parents are taking any medication, they will have to reduce the amount.
7. Baking powder (Sodium Bicarbonate) - a pinch with large glass of water can give immediate relief to an acid body.  

Ask me anything. I will update.
