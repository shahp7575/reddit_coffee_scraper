1jfcrpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1jfcrpn/colonoscopy_completed/,Colonoscopy completed!,"Just had my first colonoscopy for a wellness check. M56, 6', 190 lbs. USA (now I wait for the bill). 
Here's my take. 
The low fiber prep wasn't great but doable. My favorite was Bob Evans mac and cheese with white rice. The all liquid diet the day before was harder, but still manageable. After reading a lot of entries on this sub (you guys are awesome!) I asked for sutab and an anti-nausea pill. I had to pay 60 bucks out of my pocket but that's $60 well spent. 
Now the gross part: I went a total of 27 times. Just leave the lights on for Pete's sake, you may not have time to fumble with the light switch. It can be that close. 
I took the first set of 12 pills at 5 p.m.. I broke it down into groups of three, with seven minutes between each group. The magic started at 6:45 p.m. and lasted an hour and 15 minutes. 10 trips to the bathroom, then it just stopped, but I didn't trust anything by that point. At 10:00 p.m., with no further action, I decided to get some sleep. Woke up at 12:00 a.m. to take the next anti-nausea pill, rolled over and back to sleep until  1:00 a.m., when I loaded up the next salvo. 
This one took about 45 minutes from the last pill to the first trip. It was all over at 3:55 a.m., but it was 17 trips. The last seven were crystal clear. I was a little surprised at the force of all of them. Like the kitchen faucet blasting away for about 2 seconds, then off. It certainly was an experience. I have a bidet and I dabbed. Took a long, hot shower around 5:30 a.m..

I wasn't allowed any liquids at all from 3:00 a.m. until the procedure at 7:00 a.m. 
I did the online pre-visit forms, so I just had to sign a couple of things when I showed up. 
I got there at 6:39 a.m. and they got me all set up, took vitals, and then I waited until 7:40 a.m.. 

I'd been mildly anxious over the last few days and the most now. They wheeled me back into the surgery, checked my name and procedure. The time on the wall was 7:55 a.m.. I saw the anesthesiologist hook up the big white syringe of the Michael Jackson special. I did not see him finish squeezing the plunger! One second I was there, the next I was waking up back in the bay. DONE! WHAT?! Fantastic! Five stars! Nothing to report. 

I was way worried about how groggy I would be afterwards. Not bad at all was the answer. I was a little ""what the what"" for about 2 minutes after I woke up. They gave me a cookie and some apple juice right away. 
I dressed myself (don't bend over and pick up your shoes up, you'll fall right over). I certainly couldn't have driven right away, but I would have felt fine taking an Uber, but it wasn't allowed. I felt clear headed by the time I got back to the house about 20 minutes later. I waited for my restaurant to open and I drove over at 10:45 a.m. for lunch. 

Good luck to you all, and don't sweat the mocha coffees, I didn't. But seriously, as far as the procedure itself, getting a crown was way, way worse.

1jfcrib,https://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/1jfcrib/writeup_wednesday_every_week_until_the_2025/,Writeup Wednesday Every Week Until the 2025 NASCAR Championship Weekend #4: Penalties in NASCAR,"Last week we talked about all of NASCAR‚Äôs different flags; one of which being the black flag that signifies that you‚Äôve received a penalty of some sort, which can be a death blow to a driver‚Äôs hopes of winning a race, or even a driver‚Äôs entire season. Whether the call comes from something that happened on the racetrack or in the garage, let‚Äôs take a look at what makes NASCAR throw their version of the penalty flag out.

'

[I still fail to understand why the staffs of NASCAR's flags are so small, you DON'T want that thing slipping out of your hands and onto the racetrack](https://preview.redd.it/zp285q6jqqpe1.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f04a942329a03fbb3dd422b744e93d5b5186103)

# On-Track Penalties

The most common type of penalties you can receive during a race usually stem from infringements on pit road. Speeding on pit road at any point, pitting with the car partially out of the box, and your pit crew being too quick to jump over the wall to service a car are all common penalties that get handed down during the course of a race. Speeding penalties are backbreakers in crucial situations, accentuated by NASCAR‚Äôs policy of allowing a 5 MPH tolerance on top of the posted speed limit on pit road and drivers pushing the limits to gain every millisecond of time possible.

'

[this one certainly wasn't, though](https://preview.redd.it/8t09suufqqpe1.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=18ab902bdf17328d997d15fb44565e6f31c3e804)

'

As far as conduct ON the racing surface goes, you‚Äôd best make sure to not piss off the tower with your driving. In the past, drivers that wrecked other cars and generally drove like a lifted truck on the highway would be held for multiple laps on pit road as a deterrent. In some cases, drivers that made egregious moves on the track would get parked, as in they were called off-track to go to the garage and not return to the race, essentially an in-race disqualification. The same can be done if you‚Äôre going too slow on the track, as NASCAR tries to enforce a ‚Äúminimum speed‚Äù on the racetrack to make sure no one‚Äôs being a moving chicane at high speed; in the days of the Damaged Vehicle Policy, that minimum speed becomes a mammoth of a benchmark when trying to fix a damaged racecar.

'

There‚Äôs also this one obscure rule that everyone talks about, what was its name again‚Ä¶ ah yes, the yellow line rule. We‚Äôll revisit this one at another time; it‚Äôs too controversial to take just a quick swipe at it.

'

[and that's not even mentioning trying to manipulate races...](https://preview.redd.it/91wov04opqpe1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a7976b158c7a8537fc98126b3a3a467a28c8266)

# Off-track Penalties

You don‚Äôt even need to be on the racetrack to get a penalty; in the case of Dale Jr in 2004 at Talladega, all you need to do is swear in victory lane and that FCC invoice will show up Tuesday morning without so much as a ‚Äúhow do you do?‚Äù, along with NASCAR‚Äôs own requests for money. Fines and points deductions are commonly used to leverage penalties against drivers, teams, and owners if some rule has been broken not during a race. Pre and post-race inspections are breeding grounds for all sorts of infractions to pop up, which can (and has) decided races in the past.

'

Pre-race inspection is necessary to make sure all cars are race-legal and can be admitted into the site of competition on raceday. Failing these extensive checks by trying to skirt some part of the rules usually results in a huge disadvantage when the green flag drops, namely losing your starting spot and having to serve a drive-through penalty almost immediately. In fact, failing ANY inspection before the race can have major effects on one‚Äôs weekend; in the case of Michael Waltrip in 2007 at Daytona during Speedweeks, it can have a major impact on an entire season.

'

[also make sure you don't leave any extra tape laying around...](https://preview.redd.it/zzf6ihfwpqpe1.png?width=2989&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cd93f010df431d3faf9555bedc735adfe1ec324)

'

But it‚Äôs failing post-race inspection that can do a lot more damage a lot quicker; just ask Denny Hamlin, who is the most recent driver to have had an entire win stripped away because of infractions found in post-race inspection, along with Kyle Busch who finished 2nd behind him at Pocono in 2022. Believe it or not, this phenomenon has only happened a few times before, the first being in THE very first Strictly Stock race at Charlotte in 1949. Jim Roper is listed as the first ever winner in Cup Series history because of Glenn Dunaway putting illegal rear leaf springs in the back of his 1947 Ford and winning by 3 laps over Roper, only for officials to strike down the win and give it to Roper who‚Äôd only completed 197 of 200 laps; Dunaway then sued for $10,000 but had his case dismissed by a Greensboro judge expeditiously.

'

[Before Denny Hamlin, you had to go back 62 years to find the previous disqualified winner in Cup history, that being Emanuel Zervakis in 1960 at Wilson Speedway for having an oversized fuel cell](https://preview.redd.it/u5nntsw6qqpe1.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=6acdeeb30ec888daf96d1b68ea14b00d2c73c180)

# How Does NASCAR Decide on Penalties?

Today, NASCAR uses a level system when deciding on penalties, divided into 3 tiers: L1, L2, and L3. 



\- L1 infractions are for things like being too light in post-race inspection or not using the right parts for a car, and range from between 20-75 points deducted (driver and owner) and between $25,000 to $100,000 in fines

\- L2 infractions are for things like modifying single-source parts or messing with components in the engine, and range from 75-120 points deducted and up to $250,000 in fines along with suspensions for team members

\- L3 penalties are the harshest, usually for messing with the Big 3 of engines, tires, or fuel; sanctions for L3 penalties include points deductions in the 120-180 point range, and fines up to half a million dollars. All 3 of L1, L2, and L3 infractions found after the race result in the race result being wiped, essentially a disqualification.

'

[Reddit's darling Chase Briscoe became the first to get a massive penalty completely overturned in the Next Gen era, wiping out an L2 infraction from Daytona 500 qualifying without his crew having to serve any suspension or pay any fine](https://preview.redd.it/s4vfwe9wqqpe1.png?width=5249&format=png&auto=webp&s=e71a790c2e3f5c4a95a1a4acfd74be30217710b5)

# Are There Good Types of Penalties?

Just because you receive a penalty does not necessarily mean that you got punished. In fact, one particular event this past weekend proved that taking a penalty is sometimes the better outcome compared to what could have made things MUCH worse. Last Sunday‚Äôs race in Las Vegas saw a number of teams struggle with getting lug nuts tightened on their racecars, resulting in quite a few detachments of Goodyear tires from NASCAR stock cars north of the Strip. The most pivotal incident of these involved a driver looking to match history: Christopher Bell; off the back of 3 consecutive victories to start the season and looking to match Bill Elliott‚Äôs feat of 4 straight wins from race #2 to race #5 in 1992, felt a wheel loose after leaving his pit box late in the race under caution.¬†

'

[so... is NASCAR gonna fix this loophole or...](https://preview.redd.it/m69ek287rqpe1.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=50447666cafb564a2ba4b44f7f5734420870ff64)

'

Knowing he and his team would get severe penalties if he went onto the racetrack with a wiggly wheel, Bell called an audible and parked it in teammate Chase Briscoe‚Äôs box (who also had lost a wheel earlier in the race and had gone multiple laps down). Briscoe‚Äôs crew tightened the loose lug and sent their fellow team car on their way, with NASCAR posting the #20 with a penalty for pitting outside the box. However, considering the penalty for letting a wheel go involves getting held for multiple laps and crew members getting suspended for a few weeks‚Ä¶ it was a timely and quite fortunate decision by Bell to drag his car into a friendly pit box. 

'

[whatever you do on the racetrack, don't make the officials' jobs harder than they need to be](https://preview.redd.it/sidbb6knrqpe1.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbad07fc7bbc7a86d899892f8018fd02e8b01bc1)

1jfcpkc,https://i.redd.it/pzz3gtemrqpe1.jpeg,Made my coworkers hate me,"It all started whenever the plumbing in my coffee shop broke. My boss (the owner) is known for being very very cheap and trying to fix everything himself and it usually takes forever. The plumbing stopped working and for about a week we had to leave the store and walk to another store every time we had to use the bathroom (which is often because we are drinking water all day and the AC is also broken). 

The first week of not being able to use the bathroom in our drive thru coffee shop was annoying but tolerable. Then when taking the trash one day I walked out and say the owner using a handheld hammer hitting the pavement of the parking lot. And I went inside and we joked about him bringing a jackhammer the next day. 

The next day he brings a jackhammer and is hammering into the parking lot (which is not ours, we use another store parking lot). So he is jackhammering like 2 feet deep to try and fix the plumbing himself. He is not a plumber, nor does he have a permit. 

Then the bathroom toilet decides to flood while he is away at mernards looking for parts. And the manager of the store and I (17 years old) are left to clean this dirty smelly water that literally has brown pieces in it. 

I am a barista, not a poo vacuumer. I am on the brink of tears, my shoes are wet, it stinks, cleaning this up, when the owner comes back and sees us cleaning and LAUGHS at us, and says something about us using towels to clean the mess. 

I had already been there 10 minutes past my shift, to get laughed at? Heck‚Äôs no. I drive home sobbing crying because my shoes are wet and that was degrading and disgusting. Also just so you know about 2 feet from the bathroom is where we cook food and bagels. 

I complain to my manager saying I refuse to work until it is fixed, and I tell my parents and my coworker who was also there both tell me to report it to the health department. It had just gotten out of hand, he‚Äôs digging and the whole place smells like crap, and we can‚Äôt use the bathroom for a week and a half. 

Me and my coworker both leave a complaint to the health department and the next day the health department comes saying they had 2 employee complaints and then they shut down the store until further notice because it has to be fixed. 

Well then everyone knows I am the one of the 2 who complained because I left crying and they are mad at me because they didn‚Äôt get paid for 2 days because they couldn‚Äôt work. 

Then my PTO that I had scheduled for months gets revoked by the owner because he doesn‚Äôt have enough money to fix the problem and pay me my pto. So now everyone is mad at me for reporting it because they‚Äôre all losing money. 

Turns out he broke more stuff when he was jackhammering so the bill was pretty high, and also he was dumping the sewage, rocks, and other stuff he was digging up into a rain sewer. 

Am I in the wrong for reporting? Personally I feel like if we can‚Äôt go to the bathroom, it stinks, and the bathroom is literally leaking everywhere that we shouldn‚Äôt be serving food and coffee. Because if I knew that there were people cleaning up poo water beside where my food was getting cooked I would not be happy. 

The picture above is after he supposedly ‚Äúfixed it‚Äù and later that night it broke on the closing shift right before they clocked out. ",3,1742431561.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

I'm sorry if this post doesn't make sense my head is all over the place 

The relationship was like how all relationships tend to be seems perfect with a few issues, I did and still do absolutely adore him and you could obviously tell he felt the same way. I was aware he has some trauma from past relationships and it's making it more difficult for me to see if this is all due to his mental health or he is TA.

So he had a female friend who when we started dating admitted she had feelings for him and I told him as long as she stays a friend I'm happy for them to be friends she throughout the relationship made it obvious she liked him constantly asking if he likes her putting heart comments on his pictures just adding extra stress that wasn't helping the relationship.

Around 2 months into the relationship I noticed he had a dating app on his phone so I questioned it he then responded with I was making sure you wasn't on it (yes I know why did I stay with him everyone thinks I'm stupid for staying) I knew he had been cheated on in the past so I just responded with oh okay and completely forgot that even happened and the relationship went back to going great then around 5 months into the relationship he started asking if I was talking to other guys so I reassured him I wasn't then the little issues started becoming more frequent his mental health was really bad and was causing him to have seizures regularly throughout the relationship I constantly asked him to look into having therapy or something to help his mental health but it just got to the point where I felt like I was nagging him and his mental health just kept getting worse to the point where mine was being impacted and I no longer wanted to wake up anymore he was telling me that the voices wanted him to harm me and I just shut down I asked him for a week to myself so I could sort my head out he agreed but then didn't give me the space and got upset because I was doing what I said I would be doing. 

One day he randomly asked me how I was which was odd for him as he never usually askes how I am I was having a really bad week due to pmdd and I just decided to be honest with him and told him I was feeling depressed but I was scared to talk to him due to not wanting to make him stressed and trigger a seizure he reassured me it was fine so I told him I have been feeling really down due to your mental health he didn't seem to understand what I was saying so I had to be very blunt with him and tell him that his mental health is making me not want to be alive anymore, I could feel myself getting angry and I asked him if we could come back to this when my emotions have settled as I don't want to snap he agreed but again didn't give me the space I needed saying it will be fine because he is going to be going to therapy so I said it might be fine for you but the damage has already been done for me I then repeated that I needed some space for my emotions to settle as I didn't want to snap I acknowledged the fact I'd be negecting him but I needed to so not to make this situation worse.

The next day we argued because I noticed the woman that has a crush on him commented a heart on one of his pictures he posted normally I'd ignore it but my temper was unfortunately still short so I asked him what was going on at this point I just slowly started to feel like I was going insane everything settled down only for the next day my mother's boyfriend asked if me and my partner was okay I said we are having a few issues but I'm sure we can sort things out for him to respond with ok it's just he asked me the other day if you had another boyfriend so I told him no I don't think so I think she has enough with the one she's got. When I questioned him he said he trusts me and he never asked that question at that point I just couldn't cope it was one thing after the other so I just told him it's over as my brain couldn't in that moment think of any other way to deal with this. That week I had an appointment with my therapist so I could get another perspective on the situation and it helped a lot I could finally sleep and eat again so I could actually process what happened.

Around 3 weeks past since I left him and spoke to him I decided to join a dating app not to get into a relationship just to talk to people, boost my confidence again and see if I could find someone interesting to have a conversation with and I stated that on my profile but all it did was make it real that me and him are over and it really hurt so I deleted it. A week or so past and we had a bit of small talk and it was all going well so I asked him if he wanted to get coffee and talk about everything see if we could sort things out he said sure so we planned a day we met up and he apologised for the fact he was on a dating app and that he didn't go to therapy sooner he didn't realise he was leaning on me so much and making my mental health worse but he then was like I was so angry on this day I asked why and he said my friend came up to me and asked if we were okay he replied with we are going through some issues why? His friend then informed him that I was on a dating app (keep in mind I'm single and I'm not even on it to date) he then told me that he packed all of my things and nearly went round my house to have a go at me. I kept my mouth shut as I didn't want to say the wrong thing he asked if it was true so I said yes it was true he asked why so I told him it wasn't to date. I understand he would have felt crushed when he was told that and I get that he felt like I gave up on me and him and so it would have caused him to be angry we exchange some small talk then he starts saying that he would wait for me and wait for when I'm well again and we can get back into a relationship I told him no if you find someone that makes you happy then move on he insisted that he wanted to wait for me so I said yes but what if I'm never mentally ready and okay to be in a relationship he said he doesn't care and that he will keep waiting he then asked if I'd wait for him I didn't want to start an argument or hurt his feelings so I just said yes but realistically I don't know I might think that I'd wait for him now but in a weeks time or a month I might not want to talk to him again 

I know this is probably all small problems but my brain is struggling right now it doesn't help I keep coming down with colds and chest infections I just can't think and I have no clue what to do a different perspective on the situation would be nice but also AITA? What could I have done better in this situation I just feel like a terrible person I know the best thing for me and him is to be single right now but he keeps asking if he can see me I have told him I still need space I just have no clue what to do I have my friends telling me I should completely cut things off with him and that the being on a dating app and wanting to have a go at me is a bit red flag my harsh side of my brain is telling me I shouldn't get back with him but then the romantic side of my brain keeps reminding me how sweet and caring and lovely he can be I know I'd gladly take him back in a heartbeat as long as his mental health is better but I can only do so much apologising and trying to understand he isn't well

Mindseye Game Details:



""16 hour"" singleplayer campaign

Mindseye is part of the Everywhere platform. All content‚Äîwhether created by users or by BARB‚Äîuses the same chat, menu, and invite systems.

Memories (Missions) exist as an ARC that can be picked apart, remixed and republished by players.

The game follows a linear guided story where you move from one mission to the next in a set order.

The narrative is focused, so you won‚Äôt be wandering around doing extra tasks like stealing cars or delivering pizzas.

Mindseye is a singleplayer, linear action game. It is specifically not an open world game.



Redrock World Details:



Redrock is the central area of the map, built as a full city with careful detail.

The city includes various spots such as coffee shops, steakhouses, and local businesses that give each neighborhood its own feel.

Different areas of Redrock show life at different income levels, making the city feel real and lived-in.

The design of Redrock is meant to be reused and expanded upon in future



Second Episode ‚Äì Online Open World Game:

The second of 8 projects is planned for 2026, and is an online open world multiplayer game.

This game offers players more control and freedom over their actions.

It will feature both official servers and custom servers, similar to what you see in Minecraft. (Via Everywhere)

On custom servers, players can create and modify game modes, the story or even the map itself (like deathmatch or race modes) using a no-code tool called Arcadia (AAA open world arcs!).

This project shifts from a guided, story-driven experience to a shared online space where you can shape your own story (and create your own character) ",1,1742431171.0,MindsEyeGame,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 26 and from the eastern US. Like everyone else here, I‚Äôm hoping to meet some new people! Ideally, I‚Äôd love to connect with someone who enjoys real conversations and wants to form a genuine connection. I crave that, and honestly, it‚Äôs been far too long since I‚Äôve had it!

I like to think that I‚Äôm a pretty easygoing and talkative person, especially when I click with someone. I have a naturally optimistic, glass half full outlook on life. Unless we‚Äôre talking about coffee, in which case my cup is always half empty and I absolutely need of a refill. Sarcasm is practically a second language for me lol. But at the end of the day, I‚Äôm just someone who loves getting to know and spend time with those around me. 

When it comes to hobbies and interests, I have a ton, and I‚Äôm always open to learning about something new! I certainly don‚Äôt think we need to have all of the same interests. I absolutely love urban exploring (I have some many pictures of places I‚Äôve visited) and road trips. If it involves discovering new places, you can count me in. I also have a huge fascination with genealogy and history in general. Historical architecture holds a special place in my heart. I love to learn, in every capacity. 

I‚Äôm also a big sports fan! Football and hockey are my favorites, but I can definitely appreciate a good game no matter the sport. I have been wanting to get into UFC more as well. It‚Äôs so fun to watch, but I know next to nothing about it currently. Maybe you can help me if it‚Äôs something you like? When I‚Äôm not out exploring or watching a game, I love being in the great outdoors (when the weather cooperates, of course). I like camping, hiking, kayaking, and basically anything else outside. Thank goodness that the weather is finally starting to look up!

I will admit that I‚Äôm a homebody most of the time. I love to curl up with a good book and just relax. However, I will admit I‚Äôve been slacking on the reading recently. Pleaseeee feel free to give me suggestions. If I‚Äôm not reading, I‚Äôm probably watching a movie/TV. Some of my favorites are Star Wars, Harry Potter, Interstellar, Psycho, Black Mirror, The Twilight Zone, Breaking Bad, OITNB, and Shameless. I also have a mild obsession with houseplants (and trying desperately to keep them alive lol). I love baking, but by no means am I an expert. I like some video games, but I haven‚Äôt played in a while as I have somewhat lost interest. Although, I‚Äôm always down to watch someone else play and get way too invested in their game hahaha

Anyways, I‚Äôve rambled for far too long. If anything I‚Äôve said resonates with you, please reach out! I‚Äôd absolutely love to talk and get to know you. If not, I hope you find what you‚Äôre looking for! Have a wondering day/night, whatever it is when you come across this :)",1,1742431161.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

(Harangue + Question),"I did a little online research, but I want to hear from those of you in the system that can give an inside viewpoint...

The impetuous for my post: I did a promotional job for one of the big studios (non-union). I won't get into the specifics but they tried to get the crew to work for less than last time we did one of these (some took it; some dug in and got our normal rates). The tone deafness of an underpaid, understaffed crew doing a media blitz for a new movie, while the studio chaps ordered Erewhon coffees to set was vexing.  
No joke: we were cleaning up around a number of unopened, untouched, overpriced beverages still sitting in those brown coffee caddies... People's reduced day rates sitting on the floor. Contradictions like this are all too common. We've all seen how spending priorities seem f\*√ßk¬¥d.

The Topic:

In the middle of the last century, when film-making and distribution was vertically integrated, the courts came in and busted it up. I don't expect to see that anytime soon in this administration.  
Here is a graphic I found that shows a semi-current standings: [https://imgur.com/dGMuLtf](https://imgur.com/dGMuLtf)  
Here's an article: [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/04/what-movie-studios-refuse-understand-about-streaming](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/04/what-movie-studios-refuse-understand-about-streaming)

  
On your Roku, you can find ""other"" streaming apps, usually pretty cheaply made, but they can offer access to Public Domain films or other content that they may (or may not) have rights to distribute.

**Is there a world where some heavy hitters get together to start an ""independent"" studio and thus their own streaming service?**  
The startup would be uphill, of course. They won't have the buying power to license previous content from the major players, if those players would even allow it. So the new platform would be forced to generate new, original content. Difficult, considering the capital cost of making \*anything\* so I know this would be considered a bit of a tech startup with a high chance of failure. They would have to capture an audience, somehow.  
  
Social media is current king. But with a part of the population still wanting produced, narrative content at home, is there a world where we see successful independent streaming channels outside of the majors? (i.e. not publicly traded companies)  
And I imagine some of you can point to some that are trying or have tried and failed. I may just be ignorant to it.

I am M 27, I weight 193 lbs, I‚Äôve never weighted this before in my life, 6 months ago I weighted 163 and I was feeling great until I started working in a fast food restaurant where I had access to unlimited food for free. 

I was feeling unease with my physical appearance since I started noticing that I couldn‚Äôt fit on my clothes anymore so I decided to make change, started working out last week and start doing intermittent fasting 16:8 to be exact, I‚Äôve fasted before and 2 times I did the 3 day water fast with no problem at all.

On Sunday I decided since to do it again to boost my ketones, since I‚Äôve done it before I thought I could handle it, no big deal.

on the first day I had no issues I walked and workout and everything was fine, no craving and I wasn‚Äôt feeling the need to eat, on the second day I started noticing the effect of ketosis, mood improvements and I felt in peace, I went for a light jog and I felt a little too tired than I normally feel,but still no problem, At the beginning of day 2 I started drinking more 3.5L of water + salt and minerals (LMNT packages that contains 1,000g of salt, potassium and magnesium, on the third day (today) I woke up got a coffee and head to work (got my water and minerals as well) 

Something really interesting and that I haven‚Äôt felt before happened, I was walking to my office when I suddenly started feeling unease, my heart was beating super fast (155BPM according to my watch) I got an anxiety attack, my palms were sweating cold and I got nausea and I started trembling and got slightly dizzy, I just wanted to run away for some reason, my mind was rushing with thoughts I went to drink some water and the more I drank the more anxious I felt, idk why, so at that point after 60 hours into fast I decided to end it by eating chicken soup that I got from a restaurant nearby.

Honestly I haven‚Äôt felt like this before and was a very intrigued if it had something to do with no eating at all   (Which I think 100% it was), after eating I feel very well but my energy levels were so down that I wanted to sleep. 

Have you guys felt like this or was it just me? How do you guys dealt with it? Did I do something wrong during my fast? I want you to know your personal experience and thanks for reading my absurd story ",2,1742430532.0,FastingScience,0,1.0,False

I have a bit of a dilema. 

Currently, my hose broke for my BMC Luna G3. There is a hose in the mail but in the meantime, I currently am sleeping without my Cpap machine. 

This is where the problem starts. 

I noticed that when I sleep <7 hours, I can wake up easier, yes I feel a tad tired but I can function during the day and feel awake.

If I sleep >7 hours, I notice it is very hard to wake up and I yawn and feel tired all day and need coffee to boost myself up. 

This is backed up by my Apple Watch, which I know isn't super accurate but it does give me information. On how many times I wake up and such.

With the shorter sleep times, I have noticed with the data, that I dont wake up as much and have deeper sleep.

With my Cpap machine. 

I notice, no matter what I still feel tired but my energy during the day is somewhat average. 

I have tried everything that I have researched online and reccomended by a doctor, from vitamins, to going to bed at a regular time.

Do I need to just suck it up and use the machine?   
I remember the reason I got this machine was a friend said, that they use one and feel a million bucks on 5-7 hours sleep. This lead me to going and getting a sleep study done and finding out I have Mild Sleep Apnea.

Electrolytes, in the form of noon tablets, have been a game changer for me. I have 32 ounces of water with two tablets in the morning, then throughout the afternoon. I will have one tablet for 32 ounces two or three more times. Then I have a coffee.

On the package, they say use one tablet per 16 ounces up to three times per day. Given that I am using it five or six times per day when fasting, should I be concerned? What symptoms should I look for to be aware if I am ingesting too many electrolytes?

My body feels like it likes the salt and I enjoy it a lot.

1jfcbuh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jfcbuh,AITA for dating an ex-friend‚Äôs ex husband over a year later,"(This is an edited version of my original post. I didn‚Äôt re-read the post and realized where I came off wrong. I apologize.) 

First I want to say that this is my first ever story ever posted on here. Also, hello CharLOT I love you! I watch/listen to you daily and my boyfriend has started to as well. Here‚Äôs a little back story. 

This is a long one. Strap in. 

About 3 years ago in the summer of 2022, I moved to a new town. I started a job at a coffee shop and became quick friends with my manager; Let‚Äôs call her Kim. We started hanging out, outside of work, along with a couple other co-workers. The first time we hung out after work she and I, along with another friend, went to a wine tasting. That is where I met her husband, we will call him Jake and his parents. Kim and Jake were high school sweethearts, having only ever really been with each other, and had 2 girls together. They married young and had been happily married for years. 

Eventually Kim started to complain about Jake. ‚ÄúHe fell asleep watching the girls this morning‚Äù, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so lazy‚Äù, ‚ÄúAll he does is sleep‚Äù, ‚ÄúI always have to check cameras or call him to make sure he‚Äôs awake‚Äù, and my favorite one ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt help me clean or do anything around the house‚Äù. Jake works in a factory, 3pm-11pm Mon-Fri and sometimes Saturdays. He handles machines over 400 degrees and has to physically put all of his body into his work. He‚Äôs had other taxing jobs too like construction and road work, he‚Äôs been the main ‚Äúbread winner‚Äù. When Kim would constantly talk down about Jake, I could never understand her. Jake is a sweetheart, selfless, loyal to his core and so gentle. 

He did just about anything Kim had asked him to do; Waking up at 4/5am every day to watch kids, take care of the dogs, do the dishes, pay the bills, go shopping, and pay for her things as well. Kim did the bare minimum at work. She‚Äôd sit at her desk and be on her phone and laptop, doing personal things. She‚Äôd also sit in her car for hours, or go ‚Äúshopping‚Äù for the store and be gone. She often times would even come in for only an hour of work and leave, always saying ‚ÄúAs long as I show up for a little bit‚Äù because she was on a set salary. Anytime there was an issue or question, she‚Äôd get upset and annoyed. She expected perfection and things done her way. Kim is a very big control freak and has been like that apparently forever. 

Regardless of her attitude towards him, the way she treated him, the way she talked to him; He stayed and loved her with all of his heart. Kim wasn‚Äôt so bad at first; or so I thought. She included a lot of people in outside things for work. She wanted to be friends with everyone. She‚Äôs artistic, funny, and sweet. Kim truly isn‚Äôt the worst person in the world. We became good friends within a year and a half. By April 2023, she changed and so had their relationship. Funny thing is, things started to change when we got a new co-worker (he‚Äôll be Nate); A tall, muscular man that worked out often and loved being outside and all sorts of stuff. Jake was the opposite. He was always exhausted, working when she was off, always in bed late and up early, sometimes no sleep at all. He didn‚Äôt work out or go anywhere. He had no time or energy. 

So July comes around, Kim and Nate had gotten closer. As a group of friends, we‚Äôd go to the lake, and on weekends Jake would join. Jake and Nate became friends, got along well and had quite a bit in common. Eventually it got to the point where Kim AND Nate would go to the lake on a daily basis (keep in mind she had 2 toddlers at home while Jake worked). Often times staying the night together. She claims nothing ever happened but I always felt skeptical. Eventually Kim confided in me that she wasn‚Äôt happy with Jake anymore because he didn‚Äôt put in ‚Äúeffort‚Äù and ‚Äúlet himself go‚Äù (he was a little chubby). She said she was starting to like Nate, which I had already assumed, along with everyone at work. She said she was enjoying his company and that he gave her peace and she felt like herself more. Okay, I can understand that except Jake was doing all he could to keep up and she didn‚Äôt thank him once. She then goes on to tell me how she plans to talk to him and give him 2 weeks to clean up and put in effort otherwise they were separating. This was the moment I knew she was NOT the person I thought she was. 

She got feelings for another man while married and WAITED to decide she didn‚Äôt want him anymore. But then gave him 2 weeks so she could decide between the two depending on what he does for her? He wasn‚Äôt happy and you could tell. He was exhausted, put no effort into his looks, and gave up on having friends. She got to go out to the bars and spend time with friends and be kid free whenever she wanted. Those 2 weeks were her way of pretending that she wasn‚Äôt leaving him for another man. That‚Äôs how I see it anyway. After the separation, even though the house was in Jake‚Äôs name and his alone, he moved out and into his parents‚Äô. He continued to help pay bills and did what she‚Äôd ask still because he needed his kids. 

A few months go by and the owners of the coffee shop want to sell it and open a new one in a town over an hour away. They offer her the manager position there; She can name it and create her own logo. Everything was hers to run. She thought about it for a while and told them that the only way she‚Äôd be able to move is if all of her debt and majority of her bills were paid for. So they gave her the money to do so. Little did they know, she had to pay off credit cards, a lot of them, that‚Äôs she had in JAKE‚ÄôS NAME! Her vehicle stayed on Jake‚Äôs credit and she still kept it but didn‚Äôt pay any of it. He still has a credit card he has to pay off because of her mind you. On top of a car that is currently ruined because she never took it into the shop for the regular checks. 

(I knew all of this because Kim would tell me and once Jake became more comfortable with me, he also told me. His parents have also chimed in here and there with information and thoughts)

By December, she was packing, dealing with her affairs, and went through the house to get everything she wanted from it. Guess what she did? If you guessed that she left the house trashed, YOU GET A COOKIE!! She had it DESTROYED. Jake and his parents had to go over to deep clean the kitchen, living room, and dinning room. She also left their dogs there and gave Jake no help when it came to them dispute them being her dogs. Jake couldn‚Äôt stand living in that house, he had just gotten his heart broken and was going through divorce and trying to figure out co-parenting. So he stayed with his parents and when he had the girls, they stayed too. It‚Äôs not ideal, but he confided in me as a friend (before we got together) that he couldn‚Äôt handle all the memories just yet. 

During all of this, I stayed friends with Kim. Jake had gone radio silent due to depression and ended up in a new relationship in 2023 as well. Even though we didn‚Äôt talk, Jake and I were still friends. They BOTH knew that I was still friends with the other!! It wasn‚Äôt until July that we began speaking again. We ran into each other at the bar one night. I love Kim still and I have adored their girls since the start. HOWEVER, I was not seen as family. The girls didn‚Äôt call me auntie, I wasn‚Äôt her sister, we were just close friends. I understand that she felt that way, and I had felt that way at one point until she became someone hard to reason with.

 That is until she moved. I didn‚Äôt hear from her often, when she‚Äôd come to town she‚Äôd tell me she plans to see me but never actually contact me while she‚Äôs in town. I then started hearing things that she had said about me behind my back and things turned more sour. We had next to no contact. Jake and I however became closer friends. He and I had NO thought in our minds to be anything more than friend. I was his ex‚Äôs, ex friend and he was her ex husband. Jake and I would go out WITH FRIENDS to the bars. I‚Äôd be there for their kids‚Äô bday parties and I get along with the family. They all love me (now) and have made it very clear. I am also the ONLY friend that ever showed up to their birthdays, Kim even told me that herself. 

Fast forward to September 2024. Jake and I are great friends. We have confided in each other and been vulnerable with each other. We‚Äôve given advice, made inside jokes, all of it. He then started coming over to my place often, we always had FRIENDS with us. We‚Äôd watch movies or listen to music and talk along with special gardening involved. I started to realize I was getting feelings for him, he was absolutely adorable because he was shy at first and didn‚Äôt get comfortable or close to me for weeks. He‚Äôd make me laugh and talk me through hard days. (I have BPD) One day after his daughter‚Äôs bday party, I texted him telling him he looked good. He didn‚Äôt know how to respond so he just said ‚Äúthanks‚Äù and I had thought that my shot was turned down. Despite his actions and the way he talked to me, I thought I had to move on from those feelings. 

Except I was wrong and he made that very clear at the beginning of October. About a week in, Jake and I had a movie night alone at my place for the first time, none of our friends were free. He needed a friend and so did I. So we started movie nights. Each night Jake would scoot closer and closer and finally the 5th movie night, we lean into each other and start cuddling. From then on, we had many movie nights with talking and eating snacks. We laughed and felt so comfortable and at peace together in the chaos of our separate lives. My family had no plans for Thanksgiving, so I was invited (before dating Jake) to their family Thanksgiving. (Note: This is NOT the first big thing I have spent with this family even though holidays seem more intimate, his family is very welcoming to friends. 

By November, we wanted to be more. Before making it official, I told Jake that I WANTED TO TALK to Kim about him and I before she found out another way. We had after all, slipped into these feelings and didn‚Äôt expect to start anything. So I thought it right, even though we had no contact with each other. She WAS a friend and I felt she deserved to hear it from me. Jake however, did not feel the same way, arguing that she was barely a friend anymore because she stopped talking to me and that it doesn‚Äôt matter if I tell her myself or she finds out. I was irritated and thought on it for a while and decided I WOULD talk to her. But I did NOT want it to be over the phone or text, that‚Äôs not how I deal with serious talks and she knows this. I prefer face to face. 

On the 8th of November I get a text. Kim had found out from Jake‚Äôs parents that I‚Äôd be at Thanksgiving. I never got confirmation if she assumed it or who told her that he and I were seeing each other seriously. But she was NOT happy. Now, I‚Äôm sure I said some things unreasonable and probably escalated things as we fought that evening. I however thought it right to defend myself and Jake, who has always had a hard time putting his foot down with anyone (Screenshots included of course üòò). After that, Jake and I decided to make it official on the 11th of November (11/11 imagine that ü•∞). 

Okay, this is where things get ridiculous in my book. The girls knew about Jake and I and I had asked them myself when they had brought it up. His oldest asked if we were dating as I had been around every weekend, he said yes and I looked at them and asked them, ‚Äúis that okay with you guys?‚Äù And the smiles they had on their faces warmed my heart. I knew that as long as his girls and family liked me, I was set. I wanted Kim and I to be on good terms of course, I do not hate her, even now despite the things she has done and said. His girls are 6 and 4 and VERY smart and quite independent for toddlers. I have never walked into his family‚Äôs home and felt unwelcome. 

Jake and I would take the girls to the movies or out to eat with us, our date nights were with them. I‚Äôd take pictures and videos and post them on my Snapchat. I had 3 of Kim‚Äôs other friends on my Snapchat because I thought they were also my friends. I would get screenshot notifications from my story. Of course it doesn‚Äôt show who, but I knew it was one of the three as she‚Äôd text or call instantly and chew Jake out. I removed all of them, it didn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out who would be the ones doing it. So after the first blow up, Kim set ‚Äúrules‚Äù. I was no longer allowed in HIS PARENTS‚Äô HOUSE when the girls were here. I was not allowed to see them. Period. 

We all thought it was absurd to set that rule. She had claimed it‚Äôs because ‚Äúit‚Äôll confuse the girls. You were an aunt to them and now you‚Äôre dating their dad‚Äù and we explained that they are perfectly okay with it. His parents and I had talked about how it made no sense and how she had no right to tell them who they could have there or not. On top of all of this, she starts asking for money. Kim has a 2 income household and rents a house; she shouldn‚Äôt be struggling as she has a great full time job and runs her own coffee shop. The issue is, she has a spending issue, hence all of the credit card debt. She wanted money for gas, for clothes for the girls, she needed a bill paid, etc. MY biggest issue with this: Jake was paying mortgage on his house which was raised to over $900. Then electricity which isn‚Äôt much to be fair but then again, the electricity barely works. Only 3 lights work in the house. He also has his mustang to pay for on top of insurance and he has to make sure his girls have clothes as they grow fast and Kim is of no help at all when it comes to taking care of the girls while they‚Äôre here. So she expects Jake to give money to HER? It‚Äôs insanity and I can‚Äôt express how disappointed I am in this woman. Jake only gets so much a paycheck and has plenty more bills than I can tell you guys. Let‚Äôs just say he spends over $3,000 a month. And it‚Äôs only him. 

1 week goes by and the next weekend Jake tells me that the girls keep asking where I am and when I‚Äôd be over. It breaks our hearts and his parents even wanted me over. The next weekend on a Saturday, Jake and I are texting and talking about how ridiculous this ‚Äúrule‚Äù was. I had finally convinced him that she had no right to say I couldn‚Äôt go over there. It‚Äôs not her house or his and his parents didn‚Äôt care what she said. He sends me a video of the girls and they say hi to me and ask when I‚Äôm coming over. Jake and I instantly gave in and I jumped up and literally RAN to my car. After finding out the next day, Kim was livid. She was even more pissed when she found out that I‚Äôd be joining Jake when he dropped off the kids. Wanna guess what happened next? If you guessed that she set another rule, YOU GET A BROWNIE!! I was absolutely NOT allowed out of the car or to even look at her. Important note: Jake has a mustang. One with VERY small backseats and you have to get out to pull the front seats forward in order to let people in the back, out. So then one of his kids had to crawl over to the other side and struggle to get out because I wasn‚Äôt able to get out or I‚Äôd have to face the wrath of Kim. 

Then Thanksgiving comes around. Every family has their own way of doing things for the holidays. This was the first holiday I‚Äôd be at with his family, so I was unsure of how to help or what to do. I had asked Jake and he said I wasn‚Äôt expected to help seeing as his mother, aunts, and oddly enough Kim, had it handled. After Kim and Nate had left, she texted Jake. Now I don‚Äôt know the exact text as he told me what she said but she told him that it was rude and I looked bad that I didn‚Äôt get up and help. When his parents heard him say it, they all chimed in and let‚Äôs just say‚Ä¶ I clearly had no idea who Kim truly was! According to Jake‚Äôs immediate family, Kim had never gotten up to help with holidays or events before. They were surprised when she started helping with the food and the setup. Even more so when she helped put food away. I could NOT believe it! She always made it seem like she was the one to organize the parties and events and like she would cook everything. Kim was TRYING to make me look bad in front of the family, when in reality, it showed them how childish she still is. Best thing about it, no one listened to her. 

She not only went to him to talk down about me, but she also went around to our mutual friends. She said some very harsh things. I on the other hand, didn‚Äôt talk bad about her. As a child of divorced parents, I hated my parents talking bad on each other. I would never and could never do such a thing. Not only that but Kim truly is funny and has a nice side. She‚Äôs not the worst in the world and I don‚Äôt have any ill will toward her. 

It is now March 2025. Kim has stopped complaining about me and texting me. However! She HAS avoided family gatherings. Christmas was spent with no Kim or Nate.

To this day, I still don‚Äôt talk to her. We don‚Äôt look at each other much or stick around each other long. I have done my best to respect her by not talking to her. However, I go around about way to compliment her, to let her know I have no hard feelings at all. Which I truly don‚Äôt. She dresses the girls up cute and does their hair every time they come home for the weekends. Each time I compliment it and ESPECIALLY when she‚Äôs around. Comments like, ‚ÄúMommy did your hair so pretty!‚Äù And ‚ÄúI bet mommy would like that, go show her‚Äù and ‚ÄúBehave for mom okay?‚Äù Because she does an amazing job. She‚Äôs a great mother and does everything she can for them (despite her constant shopping for herself). 

As for her rules about drop off. I now get out of the car and say goodbye to the girls. Kim will stay inside, or have Nate come get them, and her favorite and most recent is ‚ÄúI had to run to the store‚Äù. We truly believe she‚Äôs still holding a grudge. However sometimes she comes here and I am often at his parents‚Äô. I am currently staying with them. 

I can‚Äôt tell you that I understand her anger, because I truly don‚Äôt. She loved me for 2 years, her children love me, her brother and I had been friends since before I met her, and Jake‚Äôs family also love me. How could she be THIS furious after being divorced and separated for over a year? Her argument is understandable‚Ä¶ IF I had INTENTIONALLY started talking to him/seeing him right after their divorce. Why would I stop talking to him for over a year if I planned to date him? 

Here‚Äôs a deeper dive into Kim and I‚Äôs relationship‚Ä¶ 

I am a loud, clumsy, hyperactive, anxious, emotional mess. I also speak without thinking, so I often times interrupted people. I had been struggling to keep myself from doing that, but it took a lot of time and I still have the issue from time to time. I also tend to talk in a tone that isn‚Äôt the right tone if you know what I mean. Sometimes when I‚Äôm overwhelmed or irritated, my tone of voice is rough and snappy. Kim had to pull me aside and yell at me a few times for my ‚Äúattitude‚Äù I had ALWAYS apologized to whoever I snapped at. Explaining how I get into my head too much and my tone is never something to take literally when I‚Äôm in that state of mind. Not only that, she‚Äôd snap at me outside of work. 

She‚Äôd judge me for the things I did, people I talked to. She tried to convince me to completely drop my best friend/sister of 15 years simply because we had a fight. I explained to her that I wouldn‚Äôt do that and I wouldn‚Äôt allow her to talk shit on her because regardless of our fighting, she‚Äôs my family. She‚Äôs the ONLY person who has seen every side of me. Good and bad. Kim would also butt in and try to get me together with guys even though I did NOT want to date. I was in a friend‚Äôs with benefits relationship with someone and had been since I was 21 years old (I‚Äôm 24 now). That ended a year ago and it‚Äôs old news. However, Kim constantly brought up that I‚Äôd see other people too. Which wasn‚Äôt ever an issue. I‚Äôd wear something or do my makeup a certain way and she‚Äôd pick it apart and tell me what I could‚Äôve done different. At one point, a coworker and friend had moved in with me. We eventually had some differences and my roommate at the time wasn‚Äôt upholding our roommate agreement (we signed a paper and printed it and all). She ended up going to Kim and complaining, I had happened to mention it a couple times to another friend and suddenly Kim gets in the middle. 

At WORK she pulls us aside to talk things out. At work. She dragged my roommate and I‚Äôs personal issues and life into our work space so we could talk it out in front of her. She HAD to know. I don‚Äôt mind complaining a little bit at work about life, however I would not stop my working to talk about my personal situation when I can do it on my own time and with my roommate. Instead she likes to butt in, thinking she knows it all. She did anything she could to have a say in things. She‚Äôs the type to never speak to you again. 

I do not hold any grudge against Kim. I know she has good qualities, but she seems to have become more bitter as of late. She continues to make things difficult for Jake. She stopped paying her car payments and the car is getting repossessed, except guess whose credit gets screwed with? Jake‚Äôs. She knows this and won‚Äôt help him pay off HER car. Currently things are civil. I‚Äôve been having dreams of us being friends again and being happy for each other. I have ALWAYS been happy for Kim. I simply never understood how she could destroy such a sweet and loyal man. 

So am I the A-hole for dating my ex friend‚Äôs ex husband? ",0,1742430445.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,0.33,False
1jfcbq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jfcbq3/research_coffee_packaging_colours_influence_taste/,Research: Coffee packaging colours influence taste expectations in specialty coffee. Thoughts?,"Just came across a brand [new study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996925005599) in Food Research International by Fabiana Carvalho about how packaging colours affect our expectations of specialty coffee. Thought you might find it interesting (even though I'm afraid it might end up on the espressocirclejerk sub, lol)  


# The Study

Researchers surveyed 238 specialty coffee consumers, showing them 16 different coffee bag colours (varying in hue and saturation) and asked about their expectations for flavour, acidity, sweetness, bitterness, body, and roast level.

# Key Findings

* **Pink packaging**: Associated with sweetness and berry/floral notes. Also seen as ""modern""
* **Yellow packaging**: Created expectations of high acidity and citrus flavours
* **Brown/Black packaging**: Signalled bitterness, dark roast, intense aroma, and cocoa flavours
* **Green packaging**: Strongly associated with ""organic"" products
* **Blue packaging**: Connected with berry flavour notes (especially higher saturation blue)

Brown was also associated with decaf and black with commercial coffee...

Beyond just hue, colour saturation (intensity) had significant impacts:

* **Higher saturation colours**: Led people to expect stronger flavour intensity, more bitterness, fuller body, and darker roast
* **Lower saturation colours**: Created expectations of milder, more nuanced flavour profiles

Interestingly, people generally expected to enjoy coffees from lighter-coloured bags MORE than those from darker, more saturated packaging. This contradicts the idea that darker colours = premium in coffee.

The study also found that younger consumers were more drawn to packaging that suggested floral notes (like pink packaging), while older consumers preferred traditional signals like brown packaging.

**Why This Happens**

The researchers explain these effects through what's called ""crossmodal correspondences"" - essentially, our brains create non-arbitrary connections between different senses. Many of these associations come from our evolutionary history and repeated experiences (there's a lot of research supporting this):

* The pink-sweetness connection likely stems from our experiences with ripening fruits
* Brown-bitterness associations may come from our experience with dark-roasted foods
* Green-organic links reflect cultural conditioning around environmental messaging

These connections are so deeply embedded that they can actually prime our taste buds to perceive flavours differently based solely on visual cues before we even taste the coffee. The researchers suggest this is why specialty coffee consumers, who typically value sweetness and acidity over bitterness, preferred lighter packaging colours that signal these qualities.

Not an overwhelming guilt. The kind that haunts you in the aftermath of depravity or debauchery resolves over time as you are further and further removed from your actions. But rather, his is a pervasive guilt. A constant hum underneath the reverberations of everyday life. Low enough that it can be shoved to the peripheral, temporarily ignored. Nevertheless it's always there, eating his life as it monitors his decisions. The voyeuristic sadist in his mind chips away, piece by piece, sculpting him into a misshapen ghoul- a specter of his younger self.



Even now as he sits, watching TV, ostensibly relaxing after dinner and a hard day at work. He tells himself he is ‚Äúspending time‚Äù with his wife, ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù from the day, and that he has ‚Äúearned‚Äù the break.



But he knows he could be doing something more consequential with her. They could play cards, or chess like they used to. Back when they were first dating, they would cook together, play games, and go for walks. He should be doing that! Not sitting in a chair next to her on the sofa. He glances over at her as she scrolls on her phone, then turns his attention back to the TV. The host is interviewing a singer who is about to perform, but first they will show a montage about her difficult life.¬†



He hears the hum of guilt under the sad music on the TV.



What would his forefathers think? *They* knew hard work. His job is cushy by comparison. He doesn‚Äôt have any kids and they had large families to raise! His whole generation is soft. Knows nothing of their hardships. Who is he to claim he‚Äôs ‚Äúearned‚Äù this rest; that he ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù a break? What a muffin he is!



He wants a beer. In fact, he knows he is going to get one. He plays this game with himself most nights. He‚Äôs full from dinner, so he sits and waits as the television lights dance across his eyes. The detectives quipping over dead extras, brilliant misunderstood doctors solving impossible cases, and reality TV stars creating drama. If he watches long enough, the feeling of being full will subside and he‚Äôll pretend to wrestle with the decision of whether or not to grab a beer.¬†



‚ÄúHe really shouldn‚Äôt,‚Äù the angel on his shoulder makes a case for the kangaroo court over which his willpower resides. He has gained too much weight. He skipped exercise again this evening because he was too tired. He listened to that podcast that explained how you don‚Äôt get quality rest even when you‚Äôve had just one beer. And after all, isn‚Äôt feeling tired the root cause of his problem? Why make things worse with alcohol?



The argument is good- both valid and sound. Still he knows it won‚Äôt affect the outcome. Once his satiation subsides, he‚Äôll pause the show and head for the fridge. ‚ÄúNo snacks tonight though,‚Äù the angel tries to save face. ‚ÄúSustained,‚Äù his willpower agrees before calling an end to the hearing.



But really, maybe he shouldn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs had a tightness in his chest lately. It‚Äôs on the left side, by his heart. He knows it is likely the anxiety that builds up from the stress of work, financial strain- and the constant guilt. But he fears that maybe, just maybe it is a heart attack lying in wait. Peering out from the bushes behind his ribcage, just waiting for the opportune time to pounce.



Maybe the guilt is good. Sure it doesn‚Äôt *feel* good, but it has a point doesn‚Äôt it? What‚Äôs wrong with focusing on self-improvement? He should get out more, find a hobby, talk to his wife, join a local recreation team- maybe bowling or pickleball! Maybe the guilt is telling him there is more to life than work, beer, and television. The show is boring anyway. There‚Äôs no time like the present to make a change. Seize the day! The time is now!¬†



He looks over to his wife, a renewed spark in his eye. She scrolls on her phone, not even aware of the story on their shared screen.¬†



‚ÄúWe should do something,‚Äù he declares, catching her attention.



Without looking up, she shrugs, ‚ÄúMeh, I‚Äôm OK. Maybe tomorrow.‚Äù



‚ÄúOK.‚Äù¬† Tomorrow sounds good.¬†



He turns back to the show; the internal hum ramps up a notch. He shouldn‚Äôt have put her on the spot like that. He shouldn‚Äôt make his needs her problem.¬† The good news is, he doesn‚Äôt feel so full anymore.¬†



Without pausing the show, he heads to the kitchen and pours a beer. ‚ÄúYou want anything?‚Äù he calls to her, grabbing a handful of peanuts from the cupboard, ‚ÄúOK, but just a handful, not the whole container,‚Äù the angel scolds.



From the living room she responds, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm OK.‚Äù The sound from the TV stops. She has paused it for him. So sweet.



‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to pause, I could hear it,‚Äù he sets down his can on the coffee table and reaches for the remote.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK. I didn‚Äôt want you to miss anything.‚Äù

I had arguably the most remote JET programme location last time I was on JET (not going to mention where due to the risk of doxxing myself) but I'm honestly surprised with how homesick I've been since getting here. When I was with JET it felt like a proper community and i made friends very easily and I also arrived with my friend. Since coming here with interac, I've just been sat in my cold room and have had 0 interaction with anyone other than going to the conbini to buy a few drinks or coffee or mcdonalds. The temptation to run home is unreal, I never thought I'd feel this way so I've been taken off-guard and I'm unsure what to do. My Japanese is pretty decent (N2) and I'm not sure what to do really, the vibe in Tokyo is so different to what I was used to in Kagoshima and Kyoto.

Warning: Overly wordy, word-salad enclosed. This might not appeal to many individuals, but that‚Äôs alright. I don‚Äôt need this to appeal to a large number of people. I just need it to appeal to the *correct* people.

*\*\*10-15 minute read \*\**

Also - Please forgive the following non-sequiturs: It is just how my mind is organized. That is to say that it isn‚Äôt.

Alright let‚Äôs get on to it!!¬†

***The ""ALL ABOUT ME"" SECTION:***

*Primer:*

Happily married going on some 20 years. Love my wife and friend after all these years and we are still learning new things about each other. Wife is onboard and we are practicing parallel poly. Her needs and are different than mine on this front so her approach is different. Proud *D.I.N.K.'s*. 

*The Technicals:*

Cis male, mid 40s, neither over nor underweight - I‚Äôm precisely where I want to be‚Ä¶like a wizard!! Of Scandinavian and Bohemian (the region) descent, so white AF - ghostly during the winter months. These things aren‚Äôt important to me beyond my genetic predispositions to skin cancer and love of foraging. I also tend to pick up rocks and carry them home with me; not sure where that comes from though‚Ä¶

Like any good mutt, \**most*\* of the less favorable qualities have been bred out of me by this point. 5‚Äô8‚Äù and between fit and tone so somewhere between endomorph and mesomorph. Yes. I looked those up. Think: pittbull-labrador mix but more Labrabull than Pitador. Average 165 US LBS‚Ä¶.if that matters.

*The Subjectives:*

Social or occasional drinker. I rarely imbibe in more than two drinks. I‚Äôm at the age where one drink makes me realize how tired I am and three makes me hung over. DDF, 420 friendly but I rarely partake unless its a gummy. Non smoker.¬†

I like fiction. Both movies and books. I love movies and have a terrible habit of sometimes watching them back to back. Denis Villeneuve, Neill Blomkamp, Guillermo del Toro currently are my favorites but I also like Jackson, Nolan, Ridley Scott, and enjoy all the way back to FFC as well. Love the MCU and really respect what Jon Favreau has accomplished in his career. From Swingers to all of the MCU and his continued involvements with Star Wars as well - Who would have seen that coming?¬†

Books? If I even look at a book I fall asleep‚Ä¶so I do audiobooks instead. Classic authors from O. Wilde to Richard Adams to Frank Herbert up to more contemporary. I love the sci-fi of Corey‚Äôs The Expanse Series and most of the Bobiverse‚Ä¶and Andy Weir (I really liked Project Hail Mary - it was just great to listen to) but also have a soft spot for The Pendergast Series -- as ridiculous as it is -- at least they are original. I actually stumbled upon that series by chasing the narrator, not the authors. I could listen to Jefferson Mays read toaster instructions and be entertained.

Ideologically left. So left that I‚Äôm left handed. No. I do not use special scissors although I am not opposed to running with them. Having said that, I‚Äôd consider myself the much coveted independent as I am critical of the two party system and believe that Citizens United needs to be overturned and that politicians should have to wear the logos of their 'sponsors' like *NASCAR* drivers\*.\* Generally I do not have a very favorable outlook at the federal level *(Here's looking at you SCOTUS)* but thinking more locally, Minnesota having the trifecta has yielded more progress in the past two cycles than the last twenty. I am loving that Minnesota is becoming a sanctuary state for so many diverse groups of marginalized people and excited to see where it goes and how it transforms this state.

There‚Äôs more to unpack here but ‚Ä¶.yuck and ew: Just because I can talk politics doesn‚Äôt mean I should nor want to. I‚Äôm just encouraging the fundamentally religious, the radical right, and MAGA folks to please disregard this post and kindly move on: I believe the best way to combat those views is non-engagement and put that to practice.

Philosophically, I‚Äôd consider myself a secular humanist. I don‚Äôt sit and meditate on these things -¬† - I‚Äôm too much of a busy-body and dilettante for that‚Ä¶it just seems to fit naturally. I tend to embrace human reason and logic and philosophical naturalism as the basis of my own morality and decision-making. At the end of the day it just means I try to do the right thing by people and tend to keep out of others business if it doesn‚Äôt affect me.¬†

My character alignment is somewhere on the neutral horizon‚Ä¶.ranging from lawful thru true and over to chaotic. I do not play D&D however do play fantasy football and am aware that these two things have a lot in common.¬† I do not golf. I do not own a suit.

I am an active, internally driven person. Always got something on simmer and feel like I need to be working towards ‚Äòsomething‚Äô. I get frustrated when too static for extended periods of time.  I enjoy casual bicycling and I try to jog about 10-12 miles a week. I don‚Äôt take either of those things seriously enough to feel bad if I miss a day or two if I‚Äôm out of routine or happen to be doing something else though.

I tend to find physical activities that leave my body feeling exhausted extremely rewarding. Hiking, camping, felling trees and hauling and chopping wood, moving rocks to and fro, pushing dirt around‚Ä¶.just being out in nature. Happier in a wooded area or prairie among the lichens and fungi, critters, and wildflowers than most other places. Most of my clothing during the non-winter months is coated in Permethrin and Deep Woods Off. We also have kayaks but being on water is a distant second compared to the previous two.

That isn't to say that you can't find me sometimes also in Brainerd enjoying Lakes Area Music Festival performances, or the occasional Bemidji theater production. I'm generally happy doing whatever so long as the company is enjoyable.

I like working on my house and playing with that space: Inside and out. My style is up-cycled repurposed shabby chic. I like working with my hands and getting them dirty, cut, and bruised. I usually have at least one bruise of non-defined origin.

Creation, and the metamorphosis of things are my passions and as such: I work in the creative industry. I remember being in college, sometime in my third year and still undeclared and undecided but reading Richard Florida‚Äôs book Rise of the Creative Class and having it be the first non-fiction book that seemed to be speaking my language. I benefited, and continue to benefit from the dedication of my high school teachings: Their philosophy was to ‚ÄúSet you up for a pattern of lifelong learning and continued education.‚Äù

I like to think they accomplished that in me. I have a very unique job that builds on that philosophy that  I have been at for 20 years. I'm at the same workplace as my wife but don‚Äôt work with her directly as we have different skill-sets. That has been one of the greatest pleasures of my life and we pride ourselves on being able to check whatever we have going on at the door and have been largely successful at that. Small businesses have enough internal drama as is.

I‚Äôm a fairly private person. Don‚Äôt bother looking for me on social media: I don‚Äôt have any. No FB, no Insta, and no LinkedIn. For sure no TikTok. I pay annually to have my public data scrubbed from the internet. I consider Reddit to be the antisocial, social media and that was the appeal. I consider myself more of a four quarters type than one hundred pennies when it comes to friendships and I bond deeply and loyally to the few I have and don‚Äôt hesitate to use the term love in those friendships.

More socially: I am an extroverted introvert. I think that term is an ambivert. That is to say I love being around people. I can be around a lot of them and enjoy it but I prefer a head‚Äôs up before extended social engagements and afterwards I tend to close in on myself as I need to recharge and process. In that ballpark of subjects though, I‚Äôm fairly outgoing and easy to talk to and with: I know just enough about enough subjects to be able to talk about most everything. I‚Äôm a good conversationalist, employing the trick of ‚Äòactually being interested in learning about others‚Äô.

I‚Äôm mostly demisexual‚Ä¶at least those are my leanings. Don‚Äôt get me wrong - beauty is beauty and I‚Äôm a creature of nature - but I‚Äôd like to at least have a primer about someone before jumping into bed. I‚Äôm eternally patient and tend to ease into things rather than jump with both feet.¬† Familiar with the term polysaturated and would rather get in front of that than leave anybody hurt or disappointed as I have a tendency to burn the candle on both ends. Open and honest, constant communication is the key here.

Dominate in bed but not ‚ÄòA‚Äù Dom. I am listening to ‚ÄúThe Loving Dominate‚Äù currently, but that is more of a casual read so as to better understand my own tendencies but also the viewpoint of more submissive people. That is to say it is not a lifestyle or a scene that I am a part of. I am always the big spoon unless being barnacled.

I‚Äôm comfortable in my body and visually stimulated so I am very much a lights on type of person. I have some kinks and some turn-ons: Just like everybody else. For sure not vanilla and very few things are deal breakers and if my yum happens to be your yuck or the other way around: there are certainly negotiations to be had. Not into any one scene, either. I just like doing things that bring pleasure to and with my partner and appreciate the different wiring guides between the sexes and from person to person - and in those discoveries is where I usually find my happiness. If discussions go that far, we can certainly talk about specifics but I‚Äôm not hyper-focused on those things as it relates to this post.¬† My love languages seem to be all of them but find it more natural to give than receive.

***THE ""MY CURRENT RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS"" SECTION***

Currently I am a hinge. Running parallel between two incredible women:¬†my lovely and patient wife & partner of 20 years (as mentioned) and a sort of LDR with another beautiful soul whom I mostly see on the weekends (not every) whom I have been seeing for the past year almost. I cherish both of these relationships and consider myself to be a thoughtful and considerate hinge in effectively balancing both of my partners' needs and my own mental health.

***THE ""WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR"" SECTION:***

First off: Cheaters please go elsewhere. ENM is the key here. I don‚Äôt think I need to say this in the poly sub but I might be cross-posting so forgive me if this goes without saying. Or if you are single and monogamous and don‚Äôt mind that I am not, well then that works too. Or if you are curious about ENM and poly ‚Äî well - let‚Äôs learn and explore together; even better!¬† Or are you a seasoned vet? Then also perhaps, ‚ÄúYes, please‚Äù.¬† Tell me with compassion and care where I‚Äôm f‚Äôing up.

An AFAB woman.¬†

In the 30-ish to 50-ish age range and any race as neither of these things are really important to me as are shared interests, ideologies, and energy levels.

Someone who nurtures their mind and body‚Ä¶.or at least doesn‚Äôt abuse either of those things. Not looking for a goddess but in soul. Having said that: Physical attraction is important and I find myself attracted to other people who also fall within the HWP arena. Athletic through curvy with the understanding that age and time defeats us all in its own way.

DDF as well. If things move into a physical realm: I would feel most comfortable proceeding with current STI results in hand. Both my wife and I take that aspect very seriously. I have my current tests and have not had any changes to my own STI risks since. I already had chlamydia once in college (20+ years ago) and once is enough. Was it worth it in that particular circumstance? Yes. Do I want that or any other STI again? No. Do I want to answer to my wife if I come home with something? Also no.

Someone who is conscious and comfortably communicative about their needs, wants, desires, interests, and of course: boundaries. Someone who values honesty and integrity. 100% drama-free: This is a complicated enough relationship style without additional drama.

I am looking for someone who also embraces the challenge of ‚Äúthe new‚Äù and understands the utility that provides. I find most of my personal growth over the years has come when I am operating outside or at least on the edges of my comfort zone. Believer in Herbert‚Äôs mantra, ‚Äú¬†'Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens.¬†‚Äú So looking for someone who also thrives in personal growth and understands that many of life's best lessons come from learning from mistakes.

Local-ish would be awesome!¬† Not looking for strictly Minnesota as it is a big state and other states are closer than some areas of MN. Upper Midwest? Western Wi. Northern IA. If this is the case: Please have transportation.

Beyond that: I‚Äôm pretty fluid in my approach and malleable. I‚Äôm just looking for another nice and sweet person to include in my life. Is that you? If you are practicing ENM and looking for more of a FWB arrangement and we meet and there is compatibility and mutual interest on that level - then adaptation is part of my vocabulary. Again: Open communication and creating a safe and supportive place for that to happen is paramount.

***THE ""ALRIGHT...LET'S WRAP IT UP ALREADY, YUMMY"" SECTION:***

Let‚Äôs start here and see where this goes. If you made it his far: Thank you for taking the time.

If anything above piques your interest - please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out.

Also: Believe it or not - I *did* edit this..but not terribly so.

Also, also: I tend to be more scattered in verbal discussions than in written form. Especially when nervous or excited so if you made through this far and aren‚Äôt afraid to meet for‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶maybe not coffee (probably best not to give me caffeine on a chemistry check meet)‚Ä¶just temper your expectations regarding the likelihood of coherent, cohesive conversations. That is, at least, until I get settled down.\[",1,1742429674.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

Will seem like they don‚Äôt give a monkey‚Äôs chuff about compliance.

It‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre negligent.

It‚Äôs because they know they‚Äôre ALREADY ticking all the right boxes when it comes to generating leads in a compliant way.

Other clients will be the polar opposite.

They‚Äôll be scared stiff.

Terrified that contacting their old leads using a ‚ÄòSleeping Beauty Android‚Äô will bring lawsuits and hefty fines to their front door.

Here‚Äôs what happens next.

Because they love the idea of the ‚ÄòSleeping Beauty Android‚Äô and what it can do for them‚Ä¶

They look to YOU for the answer.

It‚Äôs a lot to put on your shoulders.

One solution:

Just don‚Äôt work with them.

Hit the NEXT button because there are 100 more businesses around the corner that aren‚Äôt going to be quaking in their boots about this.

Another solution:

Put the compliance burden back where it belongs.

ON THEM.

We had a client ask us what procedures we follow if a lead asks for their data to be deleted.

Our response ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd refer to you for guidance on erasure, as we don‚Äôt know what your internal procedures are‚Äù.

The client responded with: ‚ÄúFair point‚Äù.

You could also say:

It‚Äôs good that you‚Äôre concerned about this. What are your procedures for this so far?

If they say they don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWell I think it‚Äôs best for you to revisit your T&Cs & Privacy Policy to see if you have gained consent when you first captured the prospect as a lead‚Äù

Then continue with:

‚ÄúIf I could demonstrate how the AI auto shuts off & provides opt-out messages, would that help ease your compliance concerns?‚Äù

Remember, It‚Äôs not our job to be their compliance officer.

We have a responsibility to handle our clients' data securely and in line with their policies and expectations‚Ä¶

But, THEY need to know what their policies are.

There‚Äôs also a golden opportunity here.

To go after their 3-day-old data instead (really lucrative).

Cheeky, I know ;-)

But, how could they say no when this is an instant FIX to their compliance woes?

You could position it like this:

‚ÄúI sense your hesitancy with letting the AI contact your old data‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if you were to agree to allow us to rework your 3-day-old data, the data your sales team has already tried calling but hasn‚Äôt converted yet‚Äù

‚ÄúThey will be expecting marketing communication like this, so there should be any compliance worries on your part.

Try it out!

Understanding the Benefits of a Low-FODMAP Diet for Gut Health
--------------------------------------------------------------

Eating a balanced diet is essential for maintaining good gut health, and many people are turning to low-FODMAP diets as a way to manage digestive discomfort. If you're one of the millions dealing with sensitive stomach issues, understanding the benefits of low-FODMAP foods can be transformative.

FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. These are short-chain carbohydrates that some individuals find difficult to digest. When consumed, they can ferment in the gut, leading to symptoms such as bloating, gas, and cramps. By reducing these troublesome foods, you may experience remarkable improvements in your gut health.

### The Core Benefits of a Low-FODMAP Diet

Here are some of the standout advantages of following a low-FODMAP diet:

- **Reduction of Digestive Symptoms:** Many individuals report a significant decrease in bloating, gas, and abdominal pain when they limit high-FODMAP foods.
- **Improved Energy Levels:** With less digestive distress, your body can focus on absorbing nutrients more efficiently, leading to better energy levels.
- **Enhanced Mood:** Gut health is closely linked to mental health. A well-functioning digestive system can contribute positively to your overall mood and well-being.
- **Better Clarity on Food Sensitivities:** Eliminating high-FODMAP foods allows you to pinpoint specific triggers. Once you reintroduce foods one at a time, you can see which ones you tolerate.

**No one, and you shouldn't, but here we are!**

Hello there, sorry for the bad joke, thought I'd ease you in:)

I just want to introduce myself before I get started. I'm a complete novice in this area but I love learning about it. I hope I do this question justice and I appreciate any feedback, or the fact that you spent any time reading this at all - cheers!

I responded to a question in the title of the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/1jech9h/did_isaiah_intentionally_leave_the_identity_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) by u/Infamous_Pen1681 , but I was lazy. I put a lot of work into doing a thorough discussion of a great question from the user.

Unfortunately, Reddit would not let me post this as a comment, not even a heavily abridged version, so in order to not let this go to waste, I thought I'd create a new post, and what better way to pop my r/AcademicBiblical cherry by posting an absolute behemoth that nobody asked for?

Joking aside, I hope you stick around, i found this whole thing so fascinating!

# Preface

Even though this is very basic analysis based on the works of other established and respected scholars, I have spent a lot of time on this, so if you do go on to read this then thank you, but if you are just interested in the conclusion, then feel free to scroll to the bottom - but honestly there's so much insight in the books that I'm pulling from that I would recommend grabbing a cup of tea/coffee and going through it. Thank you u/Sophia_in_the_Shell for calling me out on being lazy, I learned a lot writing this and I hope I get to be wrong more often because I've enjoyed doing this!

I've gone into far more detail than I needed to but I wanted to be thorough and fair. You could argue I've not been thorough enough if you really wanted to!

Anyways, I've said too much (foreshadowing what is to come), let's get started!

# Detailed Post:

Below I shall present several mentions of *The Servant* in 2nd Isaiah (chapters 40-55) and provide some academic commentaries where appropriate. Initially, I wanted to do every single mention, but studying up on this... it seems a point of contention will be around chapter 49 onwards, as we shall see. So I will show that at least the first 3 chapters of Deutero Isaiah refer clearly to Israel as the servant, and then jump to chapter 49 to continue the analysis! I will be referencing the New Oxford Annotated Bible 5th Edition, the Yale Anchor Bible Commentary on Isaiah 40-55\* and the Oxford Press Jewish Study Bible - JPS Tanakh. All bible verses are quoted from the NRSVUE on[ BibleGateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isa%2041%3A8-9%3B%2042%3A19%3B%2043%3A8-10%3B%2044%3A1-2%2C%2021%2C%2026%3B%2045%3A4%3B%2048%3A20%2C%2049%3A1-6%3B%2050%3A4-11%3B%2052%3A13-53%3A12&version=NRSVUE)

*\*Wow is this book detailed! I'm going to try and pull as much as I can from here because it's got so much stuff in it!*

# Deutero-Isaiah, Chapter 40: God‚Äôs People Are Comforted

There are no mentions of 'The Servant' in chapter 40, however since chapters 40-55 are all one literary block,the context is important. I included the context in the linked post above, but I shall share it here, as well as a link to an additional source on Isaiah

**Context of Second Isaiah, New Oxford Annotated Bible (NOAB) 5th Edition:**

>‚Äú40.1‚Äì54.17: Prophetic instruction that the Lord reveals divine sovereignty at Zion. Chapter 40 begins the portion of the book (chs 40‚Äì55) attributed to an anonymous prophet of the latter years of the Babylonian exile when King Cyrus of Persia conquered Babylonia and decreed that Jews could return to their homeland (ca. 545‚Äì538 bce). Although these chapters are clearly written long after the time of the eighth-century prophet Isaiah, they nevertheless share his basic theological perspective rooted in the Zion/Davidic tradition, i.e., that the Lord protects Zion, although the Davidic covenant is now applied to the people rather than to the Davidic king (55.3). These chapters therefore function within the book to describe the realization of the Lord's plans to restore Zion as articulated throughout chs 1‚Äì33.‚Äù

**Context of Second Isaiah, Yale Anchor Bible Commentary (YAB)**

>The allusions to Cyrus in Isa 40-48 indicate that the last decade of the Neo-Babylonian Empire (ca. 550-539) was when the core of this section of the book was composed.

**Context of Second Isaiah, The Jewish Study Bible: JPS Tanakh (JSB)**

>Chs 34-35 and 40-66 are first and foremost persuasive in character. Addressed to a despondent exilic and post-exilic audience who have experienced a catastrophe, they attempt to convince the Judeans that the God of Israel is still powerful and still loyal to the people Israel. Deutero-Isaiah (that is, the author or authors of chs 34-35 and 40-66) proclaims in an especially insistent manner that only one God exists; this deity alone created the world and brings redemption.

I've given more context than was probably necessary, and included literary commentary from the JSB as pertaining to the audience of Isaiah - note the JSB does mention the differences from chapter 56 onwards, but they argue it's impossible to know whether it was a separate entity and so include it as part of 2nd Isaiah.

**Summary**

This section of Isaiah was likely written after Cyrus has freed the Jews from Babylonian captivity & the author(s) are preaching to a disheartened people and trying to get them to keep their faith in YHWH & the dawn of a new era under God.

# Basic Internal Structure

**YAB**

>Most commentators agree that chs. 40-48, which are bracketed with their own inclusive passage (48:20-22 cf. 40:3-5), form a section that is quite different in theme and tone from 49-55 in which we hear no more about Cyrus and the fall of Babylon, and no more satire is directed against foreign deities and their devotees. In 40-48 the focus is on Jacob/Israel, while in 49-55 Jerusalem/ Zion is in the foreground.Less obviously but no less importantly, usage of the key term *ebed* (servant) is significantly different in the two sections. With the exception of 42:1-4 (the first of Duhm‚Äôs Dichtungen) use of *ebed* in 40-48, whether in the singular or plural, always refers to the people or, at any rate, never to an individual (41:8-9; 42:19; 43:8-10; 44:1-2, 21, 26; 45:4; 48:20), whereas in 49-55 it is generally acknowledged that an individual figure is indicated (49:1-6; 50:4-11; 52:13-53:12). This circumstance will alert us to the possibility that 42:1-4 may call for an interpretation quite different from that of the passages in 49-55.

**JSB**

>These chs contain the following subsections: Chs 40-48: Prophecies delivered to the exiles in Babylonia, predicting the restoration of Zion and the downfall of Babylon; the tone of these is excited and hopeful. Chs 49-57: Prophecies concerning Zion and the renewal of the community there. Their tone remains hopeful, but some disappointment becomes evident.

Both the commentaries here draw attention to differences in the structure. Most intriguing, however, is the allusion to a different individual servant in the second internal block by the YAB, exciting!

Let's begin the analysis of each mention to see exactly where that change is and how it manifests, who the individual could be, and what the other commentaries have to say!

# Chapter 41: Israel Assured of God‚Äôs Help

There are just two mentions in this chapter and the appear in adjacent verses.

**Verses 8-9:**

>*8 But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend; 9 you whom I took from the ends of the earth and called from its farthest corners, saying to you, ‚ÄúYou are my servant; I have chosen you and not cast you off‚Äù;*

**Comments from NOAB**

>‚Äú8: Israel is the Lord's servant much like Moses (Ex 14.31) and David (2 Sam 7.5). The mention of Abraham recalls the origins of Israel's covenant with the Lord (Gen 15). In exilic texts the people of Israel are often referred to as Jacob, whose story of exile and return (Gen 28‚Äì35) is similar to that of the exiles in Babylon. Based on the perspective of the Zion/Davidic covenant tradition, the Lord has chosen Israel and will uphold the covenant to protect the nation.‚Äù

So the servant here is indicated as Israel & also addressed as Jacob. But just so we are starting off on the right foot, I included a citation to back this up, and to give extra context on why Jacob is used synonymously with Israel, for anyone that might be unfamiliar.

As mentioned above, the YAB makes reference to the servant in these first 8 chapters being a group of people, rather than an individual, so this is consistent.

# Chapter 42: The Servant, a Light to the Nations

There are three mentions in this chapter, two of which come in the first servant song. There starts a speech from God to Israel which continues into chapter 44.

**JSB**

>42.18-44.5: God's loyalty, which is unshaken even by Israel's sins. This long speech comforts the exiles, assuring them that God is able and willing to redeem them, regardless of the sins they and their forebears committed.

**NOAB**

>‚Äú42.14‚Äì44.23: The Lord is the redeemer of Israel. The third contention in the series is that the Lord redeems Israel. Insofar as Israel had suffered punishment and exile at the hands of the Assyrians and the Babylonians, acting as agents of the Lord, such a contention is designed to answer claims that the Lord is an enemy to Israel or that the Lord is powerless to redeem Israel.‚Äù

**Verse 1:**

>*Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations.*

**Comments from NOAB**

>‚Äú42.1‚Äì4: The first of the four so-called ‚Äúservant songs‚Äù of Isaiah (see 49.1‚Äì6; 50.4‚Äì11; 52.13‚Äì53.12). The servant represents Israel.‚Äù

**Comments from JSB**

>1-4: God introduces the servant, whose gentle nature is emphasized. In these lines God addresses the nations of the world while pointing to the servant, the nation Israel.

>42.1-9: God's servant. The identification of the servant in these vv. is hotly debated. Possibilities include Cyrus (according to Saadia Gaon), the prophet himself (so Ibn Ezra), the Messiah (so Targum and Radak), and the Israelite nation as a whole (so Septuagint and Rashi). See 52.13-53-12 n. The term ""servant"" in most other passages in chs 40-66 clearly refers to the nation Israel or to the faithful within Israel, and that is the most likely explanation here as well. This passage borrows vocabulary and ideas from both ch II and Jer.

The JSB is quite clear that (in the author's opinion) the servant is consistently, but not *necessarily* always, being referred to as the nation of Israel in the rest of Isaiah, and this is the most likely explanation in this instance.

**Verses 18-19:**

>*18 Listen, you who are deaf, and you who are blind, look up and see! 19 Who is blind but my servant or deaf like my messenger whom I send? Who is blind like my dedicated one or blind like the servant of the Lord?*

**YAB**

>The servant has already been identified (41:8-10), and this account of the present condition of the servant Israel contrasts with the profile of a future servant and his mission in 42:1-9, however the latter is identified. Also frequently attested is the theme of incomprehension, the failure to grasp the significance of events as interpreted by the seer, together with the common Isaian motif of guiding the blind (40:21, 28; 42:7, 16; 43:8).

**NOAB**

>‚Äú18‚Äì25: The passage addresses Israel as the blind and the deaf, a recurrent image (6.9‚Äì10; 29.9,18; 32.3; 35.5; 42.16; 43.8) denoting spiritual imperception and obtuseness. In fact, however, the Lord has controlled the fate of the nation all along. Now the time has come for Israel to recognize the Lord as their redeemer.‚Äù

Once again, all parties agree that the servant is Israel in this block of Deutero-Isaiah. Now for the fun bit!

# Chapter 49: The Servant‚Äôs Mission

**Context from NOAB**

>*49.1‚Äì54.17: The Lord is restoring Zion. The fifth and concluding contention in the series. This lengthy unit focuses especially on the role of the servant figure, earlier identified as Israel, in the divine plan.*

**Context from JSB**

>Chs 49-57: Prophecies of Zion. The second of the three sections within chs 40-66 seems to have been written in Jerusalem after the first wave of exiles returned there from Babylonia. Like chs 40-48, it consists of several long speeches, each of which attempts to convince the city of Jerusalem (usually referred to as Zion) or the returned exiles that their current wretched state will be transformed to a glorious one. Many of the arguments the prophet sets forth resemble those found in chs 40-48, but several characteristic themes of that first section no longer appear: Cyrus, Babylonia, the new exodus, and the theme of the former and latter things are never mentioned in chs 49-57- In their place one finds a stronger emphasis on Zion and the servant of the LORD, and one can sense disappointment at the reality of conditions in the restored Zion (cf. Ezra chs 1-3; Haggai; Zech. chs 1-8). This sense of disappointment leads the prophet to condemn the people for certain misdeeds toward the end of this section, in language somewhat harsher than the rebukes found in chs 40-48.

**Verses 3-6**

>3 And he said to me, ‚ÄúYou are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.‚Äù 4 But I said, ‚ÄúI have labored in vain; I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; yet surely my cause is with the Lord and my reward with my God.‚Äù 5 And now the Lord says, who formed me in the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob back to him, and that Israel might be gathered to him, for I am honored in the sight of the Lord, and my God has become my strength‚Äî 6 he says, ‚ÄúIt is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the survivors of Israel; I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.‚Äù

**Notes from YAB**

>This designation ‚Äúservant‚Äù (\*ebed) indicates an agent chosen for specific tasks. It may be predicated of any human agent chosen by God for a mission, whether an individual or a collectivity. In 40-48, as we have seen, in all instances save one the ‚Äòebed is Israel presented under the name of the eponym Israel/Jacob (41:8-9; 42:19; 43:10; 44:1, 2, 21, 26; 45:4; 48:20).

>In 42:1-4, however, I argued that the description of the mission and the context of chs. 40-48 as a whole strongly favor an identification with Cyrus. Since after 40-48 the focus shifts decisively away from Cyrus, we conclude that we have entered a phase in which it has become evident that the Iranian has not lived up to expectations, that he was not about to discharge the tasks assigned to him - namely, to set prisoners free (42:7; 45:13) and rebuild Jerusalem with its temple and the Judean towns destroyed by the Babylonians (44:26, 28; 45:13).

**Notes from JSB**

>1-6: The servant speaks to the nations of the world as well as the Israelites. The identity of the servant has generated much debate. Most rabbinic commentators and some modern scholars argue that Deutero-Isaiah speaks here in the first person and that these vv. describe the prophet's own mission. Others argue that the whole nation Israel is the servant, and some suggest that an ideal Israel or a faithful subset of the nation is the servant.

**Notes from NOAB**

>‚Äú1‚Äì6: The second of the ‚Äúservant songs‚Äù (see 42.1n.) presents the servant as an individual figure who is also identified as Israel. He is called from the womb much like Jeremiah (Jer 1.5; cf. Ps 139.13). 3: The servant is here specifically identified as Israel, although his task in v. 5 is to bring Israel/Jacob to the Lord. 6: A light to the nations, see 42.5‚Äì9n. 7‚Äì12: An oracle of restoration. 7: The servant's restoration demonstrates the sovereignty of the Lord in the world; cf. 52.13‚Äì15. 8‚Äì12: Covenant to the people, here the role of the servant is described in relation to the people Israel who will be released from prison to return through the wilderness to their homeland in a second exodus (see also 40.3‚Äì5; 41.17‚Äì20; 43.19; 48.20‚Äì22)‚Äù

So, the YAB seems to be convinced that the servant is no longer Israel specifically, rather it is an individual prophet taking over from what Cyrus was supposed to do but apparently never did. The NOAB is sticking to it's convictions about Israel being the servant and the JSB lets the readers know that there is some disagreement on who the servant actually is; it may be D-Isaiah himself as a prophet, all of Israel or even a faithful subset of Israel.

It should be noted that the YAB goes into a lot of detail about the author's interpretation of the servant, so I shall include one more section where they make further allusions to the servant being an individual with a task, rather than a whole group of people. In some places, the text does seem to separate Israel from the servant in this chapter, but it could also just be poetic. Hard to know for sure,¬† the YAB makes a good case, but in verse 3 we read: ‚ÄúYou are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.‚Äù and that is explicit, as the NOAB points out.

**Further Notes from YAB**

>The more detailed account of the mission that follows (8b-12) is essentially the same as Cyrus's mission (42:7; 44:26‚Äî28; 45:13) and restates in more specific terms the task placed on the servant in 49:5-6. The task of ‚Äúestablishing the land"" corresponds to establishing the tribes of Jacob (49:6 with the same verb, heqim ).

# Chapters 50: The Servant‚Äôs Humiliation & Vindication

There is only a singular mention in this chapter, and none in the following. It appears in verse 10:

**Verse 10**

>*Who among you fears the Lord and obeys the voice of his servant, who walks in darkness and has no light, yet trusts in the name of the Lord and relies upon his God?*

**Context from YAB**

>The concluding verses are crucial for interpreting the passage as a whole and perhaps also for the interpretation of Isa 40-55 as a whole. Unfortunately, the syntax leaves the meaning of v 10 ambiguous. One reading would be: ‚ÄúWhoever among you reveres Yahveh and heeds the voice of his servant, who walks in the dark and has no glimmer of light, will trust in Yahveh's name . ,‚Äù with the relative clause referring to the servant. The syntax permits this reading, but 50:4-9 does not conjure up the image of a person walking in the dark, that is, in a state of spiritual disorientation (cf. Ps 82:5; Isa 8:22), and we have seen that it does not refer to imprisonment either.   
  
Rather, it is those to whom the message is addressed throughout these chapters who can be described as ‚Äúwalking in the dark."" The speaker therefore is distinguishing between those who revere Yahveh and heed the prophetic message, even though bewildered and confused, who are urged to trust that the predictions will be fulfilled, on the one hand; and those who choose to live by their own lights, on the other hand.

Who is the servant in this instance, and are they the ones speaking throughout?

**YAB Continued...**

>Who, then, is the speaker in w 10-11? Torrey (1928, 392-93) attributes the entire passage to the one poet, none other than the author of chs. 40-66 (actually, 34-66 with the exception of 36-39). While I do not exclude the possibility that a speaker might refer to himself in the third person, the manner in which the public is addressed makes it unlikely in this instance. It makes no essential difference to attribute v 10 to the prophetic servant and v 11 to Yahveh as a pronouncement of judgment, since this too would be spoken by a prophetic representative (Whybray 1975, 153). The alternative would be to read w 10-11 as a comment on the servant's statement by one who is qualified not only to speak for him but to pronounce a judgment on those who oppose him. This betokens commentary by a disciple who shares in the charisma of the master and has internalized his message. Whether the entire passage is from the hand of this commentator we do not know, but it is significant that it opens by using the language of discipleship: the prophetic servant is the disciple ( limmud ) of Yahveh, as the commentator is of the servant. This issue of prophetic discipleship will come up again in the commentary below, on 52:13-53:12.

Here the YAB feels the servant here is still an individual, potentially one taking over the reigns of Cyrus as mentioned earlier, but the speaker himself may be a follower of said individual. What do the other commentaries have to say?

**JSB's Commentary**

>4-11: The mission of the prophet and of the nation. As in 49.1-6, Deutero-Isaiah speaks in the first person. By doing so the prophet sets a model that the nation as a whole should follow, since the whole nation has a prophetic role to the world at large. 4-5: The prophet is a disciple of older prophets, constantly borrowing their words and noting how their predictions proved true. 6-9: Deutero-Isaiah, like all Israelites, suffered in the exile. But Deutero-Isaiah knows the punishment meted out to the exiles was just, accepts it, and awaits the vindication that surely follows. 10-11: Israel's response: Some of Deutero-Isaiah's listeners will accept both divine punishment and divine reward, but others will continue to reject God's word, to their own detriment.

The JSB feels like the author and speaker is simply Deutero-Isaiah him/herself, and that verses 10 & 11 depict how Israel shall behave as a whole to this new model.

**NOAH Commentary**

>‚ÄúThe third servant song (see 42.1n.) appears in vv. 4‚Äì11, although vv. 10‚Äì11 presuppose a different speaker. 4: The servant links himself with Isaiah's disciples (see 8.16n.). 6: Obedience to God entailed suffering (cf. 6.9‚Äì10, which calls for the suffering of the people as part of the divine plan). The persecution of the servant recalls that of Jeremiah (Jer 11.9; 20.1‚Äì2; 26.7‚Äì24). 10‚Äì11: The Lord maintains that those who refuse to fear the Lord and honor the servant kindle the fire of their own suffering (cf. 1.29‚Äì31).‚Äù

The NOAB also agrees that verses 10 & 11 indicates a different speaker, and though not explicitly mentioned, it seems that the servant is an individual and it fits with the other two commentaries to say that this servant is the author of 2nd Isaiah.

# Isaiah 52:13 - 53:12: The Suffering Servant

As we can imagine, all three commentaries have a great deal to say about this section and it's various interpretations. So what are scholars saying about this[ block of text](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2052%3A13%20-%2053%3A12&version=NRSVUE)?

**Context in YAB**

>The passage begins and concludes with an asseveration of Yahveh that the Servant, once humiliated and abused, will be exalted; once counted among criminals, will be in the company of the great and powerful (52:13-14a, 15; 53:1 lb-12). This statement encloses the body of the poem (53:1-1 la), in which a co-religionist who had come to believe in the Servant's mission and message, one who in all probability was a disciple, speaks about the origin and appearance of the Servant, the sufferings he endured, and his heroic and silent submission to death ‚Äî whether threatened or experienced remains to be determined.

**Context in NOAB**

>‚Äú52.13‚Äì53.12: Announcement of the exaltation of the servant of the Lord. The fourth and final servant song (see 42.1n.) portrays the suffering of the servant and his ultimate exaltation. Talmudic tradition identifies the servant with Moses, who suffered throughout the wilderness journey (b. Sotah 14a), and early Christian tradition identifies the servant with Jesus (Acts 8.32‚Äì35). Second Isaiah identifies the servant with Israel (49.3), although the servant's mission is to restore Israel and Jacob to the Lord (49.5). Other figures identified with the servant include the prophet Jeremiah, who was persecuted throughout his life; King Josiah, who was killed by Pharaoh Neco at Megiddo (2 Kings 23.29‚Äì30); and King Jehoiachin, who was exiled to Babylon (2 Kings 24.10‚Äì16).‚Äù

**(A lot of) Context in JSB**

>One of the most difficult and contested passages in the Bible, these fifteen vv. have attracted an enormous amount of attention from ancient, medieval, and modern scholars. In particular the identity of the servant is vigorously debated. Many argue that the servant symbolizes the entire Jewish people. The passage, then, describes the nation's unjust tribulations at the hands of the Babylonians (and later oppressors) as well as the nation's salvific role for the world at large. Others maintain that the passage describes a pious minority within the Jewish people; this minority suffers as a result of the sins committed by the nation at large. (Bolstering these interpretations is the fact that the term ""servant"" in Deutero-Isaiah generally refers to the nation as a whole or an idealized representation of the nation; d. 42.1-9 n.; 18-23 n.; 49.1-13 n.) Other scholars argue that the servant in this passage is a specific individual (d. 50.4-11 n.). Targum and various midrashim identify the servant as the Messiah, but this suggestion is unlikely, since nowhere else does Deutero-Isaiah refer to the Messiah, and the absence of a belief in an individual Messiah is one of the hallmarks of Deutero-Isaiah's outlook (in contrast to that of First Isaiah). Because of marked similarities between the language describing the servant and Jeremiah's descriptions of himself (see Jer. 10.18-24; 11.19), Saadia Gaon argued that the text refers to Jeremiah, while the Talmud (b. Sot. 14a) records the opinion that it describes Moses. Both opinions have been echoed by modern scholars. On the other hand, equally impressive parallels between the servant and First Isaiah can be observed (see ch 6). Furthermore, many passages in Deutero-Isaiah view the prophet Jeremiah as a model for the nation as a whole without equating the nation and that prophet. Christians have argued that this passage in fact predicts the coming of Jesus. Medieval rabbinic commentators devoted considerable attention to refuting this interpretation. The passage is deeply allusive, drawing on the texts from Jeremiah and Isaiah noted above and also on Isa. 1.5-6; 2.12-14; 11.1-10; Ps 91.15-16.

**Specific mentions to 'The Servant':**

>*52:13 - See, my servant shall prosper; he shall be exalted and lifted up and shall be very high.*

>*53:11 - Out of his anguish he shall see; he shall find satisfaction through his knowledge. The righteous one, my servant, shall make many righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities.*

The servant is only mentioned twice by name in this block; they are introduced and prophesied to become prosperous and exalted in 52:13. The servant is then described thoroughly in the intermittent verses and finally we are told he will make many righteous and 'bear their inequities'. As mentioned, this is an important section of text for many, but who exactly is The Suffering Servant, and if we can't be certain, what's the best guess based on the historical context?

# Who is the Suffering Servant?

**NOAB**

>‚Äú52.13‚Äì15: The disfigurement and suffering of the servant, but also his exaltation elicit astonishment from foreign nations and rulers (cf. 49.7). 53.1‚Äì12: The intense suffering of the servant is defined vicariously; just as the Lord calls for Israel to be blind and deaf so that they will suffer punishment (6.9‚Äì10), so the servant now exemplifies that role. His suffering serves as a means to atone for the sins of the nation, much like a lamb sacrificed at the Temple altar. 10: The servant's offspring refer to those who follow his example and teaching after his death rather than indicating that he survived and was rehabilitated.‚Äù

Earlier, this commentary mentioned that Isaiah was identified as the servant in[ 49:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2049%3A3&version=NRSVUE), but it acknowledges the mission of the servant to restore Israel back to YHWH. This indicates, along with the other commentaries above, that the servant could be seen as an individual Israelite rather than the nation asa whole, at this point in 2nd Isaiah.

**JSB**

>52.12-15: God's first speech. God describes the servant, who will ultimately, and surprisingly, achieve great things. 14: So marred ... semblance, rather, ""His appearance was more disfigured than any man's, his form, more than any person's."" 53.1-11a: The surprised observers' speech. The identity of the speakers who express their shock at the career of the servant is unclear. Are they the kings and nations of the world (d. 52.15)? If so, then the servant is probably the nation Israel, and the nations are stunned that such an insignificant and lowly group turns out to have been so important to the divine plan. (Cf. Deut. 7.7) Alternatively, the speakers may be the Judeans themselves, in which case the servant is either a pious minority (the ideal Israel, in contrast to the mass of Judeans whose faith and behavior miss the mark God set for them) or some individual within the Israelite community. 4-6: Either the servant suffered on behalf of the speakers (i.e., the guilty were not punished at all), or he suffered along with the guilty, even though he himself did not share in the guilt of his fellow Israelites. The former idea (i.e., the notion of vicarious suffering) would be unusual for the Bible; the latter idea (the idea of corporate guilt) is not. 8-9: Cut off from tile land of tile living ... grave: Scholars debate whether these lines describe the literal death of the servant or the severe straits he was in. Exaggerated descriptions of one's plight as equivalent to death are common in the Bible; see Pss. 18.5-6; 30-4; Jonah 2.2, 8. 10b-11a: The servant is vindicated. Either he is saved from a fate like death, or he is actually described as being resurrected. In the latter case, his resurrection is probably a metaphor for the renewal of the nation at the end of the exile. Similarly, in Ezek. ch 37 Israel in exile is described as dead; the nation is brought back to life when the exile ends. 11b-12: God's concluding speech. God describes the vindication of the servant, echoing and confirming the themes of the spectators' speech.

The JSB goes into a lot of detail here, giving plenty of ideas about the servant and their identity. It could be Israel as a nation, the ideal Israel (the faithful section) or once again an individual in the community, perhaps a follower of Deutero-Isaiah as mentioned above. It also draws on other Biblical themes of a 'resurrected Israel' in Ezekiel, adding to the metaphorical layers of Israel's prophesied restoration.

**YAB Overview**

Honestly, the YAB has so much to say (once again) on this topic, it's a goldmine of scholarship and I'm just in awe reading it as a complete layman. If you are interested,[ here is the book](https://archive.org/details/Isaiah4055YaleAnchorBibleCommentary/page/n365/mode/2up). The analysis of this section starts on page 349 (slide 366 as the bottom) and continues for several pages. I shall include a few of these interesting insights and then some closing thoughts - ok more than a few it turns out, please forgive me.

**The Servant Bearing Sin (YAB)**

>That the Servant bore the burden of the community's sin is repeated several times in the body of the poem, using much the same vocabulary (sabal, nasa, avon, het\*) in different combinations (53:4a, 5, 6b, 10a). It is not said, at least not clearly and explicitly, that he volunteered to do this, or even that he accepted it willingly, in spite of the reference to ‚Äúintercession‚Äù at the end of the passage (see below). It was Yahveh who, exceptionally, caused the sickness, suffering, and ills to fall on him (6b). According to the dominant theory of moral causality, however, the community's transgressions should have brought on themselves these ‚Äúwages of sin‚Äù instead of on him. What the body of the poem gives us is an interpretation by a convert to the Servant's person and teaching, offered either in his own name or that of the group to which he belonged.

*\*I have edited this and removed the accents above the bracketed letters*

**The Servant as a Scapegoat (YAB)**

>The Isaian poet does not state the analogy in formal terms or explore it at length, but it is hinted at elsewhere in the poem in the image of a sheep being led to the slaughter (53:7b) and the pouring out of the life-blood (cf. Ps 141:8, the same verb, also with nepes). The statement that the Servant bore the community's sin also echoes the scapegoat ritual (Lev 16), in which one of the two animals is sacrificed as an atoning sin-offering (hatta‚Äôt), and the other carries all the community's iniquities into a solitary, literally, ‚Äúcut-off land"" ( y eres gezerd), recalling the Servant's being cut off from the land of the living (nigzar me y eres hayyim 53:8b).

**A Disciple or a Nation? (YAB)**

>The empathic language of 53:1-12 also renders it unlikely that the speaker represents the nations and their rulers mentioned in the Yahveh discourse. The eulogist is an individual, almost certainly a disciple, as noted earlier, and one who speaks on behalf of those who ‚Äúrevere Yahveh and obey the voice of his Servant"" (50:10).

**The Sins of the Servant (YAB)**

>The new understanding is introduced by referring to sickness and suffering in inverse order: his suffering and sickness made it possible in some way for him to bear the burden of his co-religionists' transgression and iniquity. Presupposed is the relation of moral causality between sin and physical affliction. This is a diagnostic based on experience: misfortune and sickness are symptomatic of moral failure. Following this way of thinking, the speaker was led in the first instance to conclude that the Servant was suffering the consequences of his own sin, a conviction expressed forcibly in the threefold repetition: nagua ( y mukkeh y elohim , meunneh , ‚Äústricken, smitten by God, afflicted.‚Äù

**The Seed of the Servant? (YAB)**

>The Servant has died, or rather has been put to death, there is no doubt about that, yet we are now told that he will have descendants (zera\*, literally, ‚Äúseed‚Äù), his life span will be extended, he will see light and attain satisfaction, and (to return to the beginning of the passage) the undertaking in which he is involved will ultimately succeed. The most natural meaning is that the Servants project will be continued and carried to fruition through his disciples. Thus, Isa 59:21 is addressed to an individual possessed of Yahveh's spirit and in whose mouth Yahveh s words have been placed. He is a prophetic individual, in other words, who is assured that the spirit of prophecy will remain with him and with his ‚Äúseed‚Äù (zera') into the distant future.

**Teaching After Death? (YAB)**

>While it is unlikely that the author thought of the survival of death or returning from the dead in a straightforward kind of way, it seems probable that he retained a strong sense of the Servant as an active presence among his followers. In this respect the Servant may be compared to the teacher who is present to his disciples and whose voice is heard behind them - that is, from the past, from after his death, pointing out the way they are to go: ‚Äú Your teacher will no longer remain hidden. Your eyes will see your teacher, and whenever you turn aside either to the right or the left your ears will hear a word spoken behind you: 'This is the way, keep to it/‚Äù (Isa 30:20-21).

**YAB Closing thoughts Pt 1**

>What is proposed here, then, is that the Servant eulogized in 52:13-52:12 is identical with the one who soliloquizes in 49:1-6 and 50:4-9 and is presented in deliberate contrast to Cyrus, the Servant of Yahveh in 42:1-4. The inclusion of 52:13‚Äî53:12 in this section and the links with 49:1-6 and 50:4-9 favor the view that the Servant is none other than the author of the core of these chapters, the so-called Deutero-Isaiah. That the passage 52:13-53:12 is an insertion is suggested by the literary structure in this part of the section. The injunction to leave Babylon immediately preceding (52:11-12) reads like a finale parallel with the similar injunction in 48:20-22, immediately preceding the first of the prophetic Servant's monologues.

**YAB Closing thoughts Pt 2**

>In the great majority of cases in chs. 40-48, Israel/Jacob, the people, is the servant, whereas in the following section 49-55, as we have seen, the servant is an individual prophetic figure. The only exception is the allusion near the end to the vindication of Yahveh's servants ([54:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2054%3A17&version=NRSVUE)), which alerts the reader to a major theme in the following chapters. The usage therefore expresses a crucial duality between the people as the instrument of God's purpose and a prophetic minority (the servants of Yahveh) owing allegiance to its martyred leader (the Servant) and his teachings. These disciples take over from the community the responsibility and the suffering inseparable from servanthood or instrumentality and, if this view of the matter is accepted, it is to one of these that we owe the tribute in 52:13-53:12.

# Conclusion & Final Thoughts

Based on all the material quoted from the NOAB, the JSB & the YAB, I believe we can draw the following conclusions:

1. Deutero-Isaiah is split into two main blocks, chapters 40-48 & 49-55 (and potentially onwards to 66 if we include Trito-Isaiah in this as the JSB does)
2. In the first section, the servant is almost exclusively identified as the nation of Israel - an exception to this being in chapter 42 where the YAB argues that the servant is Cyrus.
3. In section two, the servant's identity is less clear, and can be interpreted a few different ways
   1. Certain sections allude to a continued reference to Israel
   2. It could also be a specific part of Israel, the faithful section that will not reject God's message
   3. The servant could be an individual, perhaps even Deutero-Isaiah himself.
   4. It could be a prophet from days gone, or a future prophet.

Based on my reading of these works,¬† think it's fair to say that the Servant in 49-55 is intended to be the author of Deutero-Isaiah. I believe the YAB lays out a very convincing case for this and I would recommend reading it if you haven't already.

u/Infamous_Pen1681, I hope this answers your question: I do agree that the identity of the servant is a little more vague in the later chapters, however i think there are enough clues to piece the puzzle together!

I have learned a lot from this, so thank you for anyone who has taken the time to read this! I would appreciate any feedback if you think I have made a mistake or I wasn't giving enough information...

My wife's freelancing work involves a lot of videocalling, and she likes to work in the kitchen--it's very large and that frees one of our rooms for a kid.

I've installed EqualizerAPO with this plugin (https://github.com/werman/noise-suppression-for-voice ) which removes most of the noises if I am cooking somewhat carefully. However, the retroactive VA grace period has to be set at max (10ms) for the filter not to remove f's and h's at the beginning of words. This is not terrible, but I think it may be degrading a little bit the quality of the communication (the actual delay is higher than 10ms because the bare filter also introduces one).

The ideal would be that the filter is activated when I am going to do some noises, and deactivated the rest of the time. 

It's not simple in terms of just a specific timetable: sometimes I am making a coffee or cooking for the rest of the week.

If she has to keep an eye on what I am doing if I enter the kitchen, and then going to the APO window and clicking the on/off, it's going to distract her from the content of what she's doing. Only I really know when I am going to make some noise or not.

Main question:

Is there any way for me, through a remote button in my phone, or something connected to her USB, or something else, to activate or deactivate the filter in her computer?

The simplest approach I can imagine is a keyboard shortcut, so I can connect a secondary keyboard and place it in an accessible way for me. But it would have to work without APO having the focus, since messing with her GUI would disturb her work. Maybe running some OS script?

The OS is W11.

I know I could also run some small raspberry Pi or old pc with the filter, place it in the middle, and control it independently, but I really hope there's a simpler solution.",1,1742428652.0,EqualizerAPO,0,1.0,False

* Anghkooey meaning remember didn‚Äôt make sense and cannot be reverse engineered.
* Molotov cocktails and monster capture setups never paid off.
* Julie and Ethan are going to be mourning all over again.

* Reincarnation is already very difficult to pull off with different actors and accents, but even more so with actors with unique acting styles like David and Catalina.
* Reincarnation and time-travel combined is a mess.¬†
* Juli‚Äôs form of time-travel is a very strange astral projection that makes little sense to me.

**The Prank and the Fake Ending**

I believe the last 3 episodes of ""FROM"" S3 are not the real conclusion but part of an elaborate prank and publicity stunt. The ending we saw was fake, written and directed by the actors with support from the showrunners and MGM+. We‚Äôll get three hour special, perhaps including a double bill and extended episode, and we‚Äôll get to binge it all at once.

**Clues Point to April Fools‚Äô Day**

Evidence suggests the real ending will drop on April Fools‚Äô Day. In Donna‚Äôs room, there‚Äôs a calendar with a question mark on the space after March 31st, which is April 1^(st) (NB: 3 years 4 months is the length of the cycle - which begins around important massacres, e.g. the Fort Pillow Massacre).¬†

This clue was prominently shown in the finale, inside the room where Elgin was tortured. The calendar strongly hints that the prank connects to April Fools‚Äô Day, signalling when the true ending will be revealed. The actors have also dropped the word ‚Äúfool‚Äù in some interviews.

https://preview.redd.it/6x298ne1iqpe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69753477f876c2e64044f4fb0de0aa3cb2066043

I think they might quietly swap out the episodes, change the titles, make some cryptic tweets and watch the world explode.

**Suspicion from Actor Interviews**

My suspicion about the fake ending comes partly from actor interviews. I noticed duper‚Äôs delight in their expressions‚Äîa sign they enjoyed fooling us. Before Season 3‚Äôs release, they dropped innumerable clues like mentions of explosions and kept hinting these even after the finale. Yet, no explosions appeared on screen, despite being set up by Kenny‚Äôs Molotov cocktails. I can‚Äôt express enough just how many clues the show-runners have left, in both the dialogue of the show and in the interviews themselves that have not materialised. Almost every interview is entirely scripted, and where not, the actors improvise.¬†

Interestingly, a huge number of these clues point to Amazon‚Äôs biggest stars - specifically their filmography. More on that later.

**Predictions for the Real Ending:**

*NB: the chronology of events and individuals performing each action will likely be very different.*

**Suspicion and Lists:** Tilly‚Äôs murder gets accusations thrown around, and lists made. Sarah is hunted down by angry people, put on trial and judged guilty, then put in the box. She survives the night.

**Jasper:** the ventriloquist doll will speak in a creepy voice and do some Chucky-like things around town. Ethan will speak with the Boy in White.

**Bridge Discovery:** There will be a bottomless abyss with a broken bridge and a cliff, with something interesting on the other side.

**Construction and Invention:** Jim and Jade build a revved up motorbike together, which Ellis or Harold jump the chasm at 68mph to make a radio call up a mountain (or in the lighthouse). A Canadian answers, or they hear the Titanic distress signal.

**Preparing a Bomb:** Jade will build a nuclear steam-pressure bomb to destroy Fromland as revenge, made from the reactor of the fallen (and very heavy) Kosmos 954 satellite with a one minute timer by removing its fuel rods and exploding its casing near water.¬†

**Salvaging a Life Raft:** A 1990 Faucett Per√∫ Boeing 727 plane will be found and its inflatable life rafts and life vests collected.

**Kidnap**: Fatima is captured and kept in the caves near a frozen lake. Elgin was indeed trying to help, trying to give her somewhere safe to give birth.¬†

**Catching a Monster:** Boyd will capture a monster using water and the Mabuse defibrillation paddles. He will strap it to the chair and torture it in the church‚Äôs basement to learn of her location by turning a screw.

**Solar Storm and/or Eclipse**: The sun will make everything extremely bright and hot. People will need to blindfold themselves and walk in a chain, holding each other, to deal with the harsh conditions. This may be followed by an eclipse. Both of these may occur in 1978 also. Either way, there is a massacre where monsters run freely, talismans fail, and nobody can see anything.¬†

**Colony House Under Siege:** Donna shuts down Colony House and defends it with her axe and shotgun until it is overwhelmed and the house is set on fire. We may see the true form of the monsters without their glamour.

**The Battle**: Several Fromily, including Ellis, Boyd and Kenny, will gear up with baseball equipment and go full Rambo-mode, throwing Molotov cocktails in the caves. They may find mines, and pick-axes, and burn a lot of spider eggs.¬†

**Elgin and Fatima**: Fatima will give birth in the dark via cesarean section. Her baby might be a shape-shifting changeling‚Äî(tinfoil: there could be twins, or just Thomas alone instead). This changeling will go back in time and swap itself with Thomas.¬†

**Remembering:** Tabitha will remember she is Eloise. Jade will remember he is Thomas.

**Possession and Kidnapping**: Several characters will be possessed by invisible spirits that have been haunting the town, watching and interacting, knocking, whispering, and indeed one of whom threw the rope. These people turn psychopathic and after doing drugs, feasting and behaving as if they‚Äôve only a day left to live, they capture seven others, bringing them to Khatri‚Äôs stone circle. It may be that cicadas burrow into their heads through their ears and other orifices.

**Ritual**: Possessed people will play music with various instruments, like a violin, a guitar, a tambourine, singing and dancing. The music will mimic the song from the fake ending but with richer tones. Cicadas dig through the back of the skulls of Juli, Marielle and Randall to control them. They do unique, almost interpretive dancing too.

Drugs like alcohol, morphine, cannabis, tobacco, coffee, mushrooms, and potion making of some kind will be involved. Each character will wear a different colour, and their clothing will unravel and fray as the ritual unfolds, forming a rainbow blanket/bridge. Various jewels and objects may also be involved. So too may substances like salt, pepper, honey, oats etc. So too will various fruits and berries like oranges, limes.

The possessed intend to harvest organs from their sacrifices, squeeze the organs for bodily fluids, and consume them. Animals will burst out of the possessed‚Äôs bodies and evolve and grow into seven giant monsters from modern European-Canadian folklore, including Big Foot, a Giant Squid, a Sea Serpent, a Giant Spider, the Grim Reaper and Bonne-Homme Sept-Heures..

https://preview.redd.it/gag6u2kciqpe1.jpg?width=1903&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de7924bc1f495548fada440264a55d1d7d85d52d

John Griffin makes much of the fact that FROM is a fable in his latest interview. What is a fable? A story where animals, legendary creatures, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature are anthropomorphised.¬†

**Russian Roulette Monologue and Trick**: The bogeyman (Bonnehomme Septheures) is embodied as a skinny stinking tall man with long coat, top-hat and bag of sand. He likes to play with his food. Boyd will trick the bogeyman by pretending to be unconscious. He will then challenge the bogeyman to a game of Russian roulette. But he will trick him by secretly filling his belly with alcohol, punching Jade‚Äôs belly to projectile vomit out of his mouth, shooting himself while doing the same, which will set himself on fire as he blows the three of them up. Jade will be part of this plan and contribute to the vomiting.

**Battle Royale**: Essentially, the seven spirits have been competing to fill the humans with different emotions, letting some stay alive longer to gather more, then harvesting then via bodily fluids in the organs, ultimately to power their transformations into monsters of modern North East Canadian Mythology (in this timeline), and also cataclysmic powers such as rainstorms, hailstorms, windstorms, freezes, boiling solar storms, tidal waves, floods, quicksand, earthquakes, eclipses and more. The dragon may be able to freeze people to stone like Medusa.

A massive battle royale will occur beside the Brundles, where the Polar Bear and perhaps the Bogeyman and Dragon win, potentially distributing winnings of treasure and magical artefacts. Tilly may fly around on a broom.

**The Canadian Mole:** We‚Äôll learn Clara is secretly Canadian, making her a mole - alternatively she‚Äôs like Sarah. Either way, she tampers with Fromily‚Äôs plans.

**The Bomb:** Jade may need to disarm the bomb, and forget his iPhone password or run out of battery. Jade is injured. Dying from claw injuries, he recreates the story Julie tells to Ethan with the finger puppets, telling someone (Likely Ethan or if not, Julie or Victor) to tell his parents (Jim and Tabitha) he loves them and to tell his friends (of which he now has many) he said goodbye. The ‚Äúsecret fairies‚Äù monsters are closing in, and Jade is beside the bomb, which Ethan sets off by flipping a switch, destroying the fairies and burying them all.¬†

**Victor‚Äôs Escape:** Victor returns to the modern day real world through a red door in the air.

**Time-travel Through the Bottle Tree**: In the chaos, some characters get on the life raft, and others enter the bottle tree to escape. Jade will have solved the puzzle using the 17th Fibonacci number or the Golden Ratio, relating to time and space. But they can only choose a place, not the time. They‚Äôll go through anyway, some holding hands.

**Multiple Timelines**: Several characters will time-travel to up to seven timelines: the 1930s, 1880s, 1860s, 1770s, and 1670s. In the 1860s, we‚Äôll see Crazy Horse and Okie Ito. In the 1880s Fromland, there‚Äôll be a lion, a baby elephant named Columbia, PT Barnum‚Äôs Circus Train, and several circus ‚Äúfreaks‚Äù and a clown. We may see some mafia guys in 1930s. Some characters may even end up in a future version of Fromland.

**Matthews family in 1978**: Tabitha, Julie, Jim and Ethan will travel to 1978. Ethan will shoot a younger version of his drunken grandfather (or Henry), who was scaring Julie, using Victor‚Äôs gun stolen from the post office (it may even be the bearded man in the root cellar). Julie will encounter and talk to the jock monster. Thomas will be there, having been raised by the 7 beings in this timeline.

They rescue Eloise and Thomas.

Jim is captured, or killed. Jade remembers he was Thomas, and Tabitha remembers she was Eloise. They have ancestral memories too.

There will be a predestination paradox, where attempting to prevent an event from happening (Victor‚Äôs abandonment) actually ends up causing it. A future version of Juli may try to stop herself from time-traveling - to mimic a Polchinski paradox.

**Sophie‚Äôs Choice in 1978**: As they escape the monsters, Tabitha must choose between time-traveling with Julie, Eloise and Thomas, or returning to the real world with Ethan. She chooses Ethan, returning to the real world and living under an assumed name in the states. Julie time-travels to 1993 with Thomas and Eloise and escapes to the real world too.

**Julie, Eloise and Thomas in 1993**: Eloise and Thomas have lost theirs minds and has no memory. Julie will find herself near Tabitha and Stephen King‚Äôs house in Maine, and will seek shelter there.

**Eloise in 1993:** Tabitha King and Stephen King call the police with Julie‚Äôs permission, who place Eloise as a patient in an institution. Eloise is named Tabitha because that‚Äôs the name on the police report. Julie leaves a note with Eloise telling her to be kind to men named Jim‚Äîwhich Eloise‚Äôs adopted Colombian parents hide, but acknowledge.¬†

**Thomas in 1993:** Meanwhile, Julie drops off Thomas with a now much older Tabitha, telling her it‚Äôs her responsibility to raise him. With Ethan now old enough, Tabitha takes Thomas to France and raises him there, pretending to be his grandmother and naming him Jade. This makes Tabitha both his mother and ‚Äúgrandmother‚Äù, with Ethan and Julie being Jade‚Äôs siblings, Victor his uncle, Henry his grandfather.¬†

**We Have To Go Back in 1993:** Juli asks Ethan to come back to Fromland with her to help her rescue Jim. She may even have a bandaid on her head like Jack from Lost. Ethan refuses. Juli goes back and becomes a hermit, living alone.

**Stephen King‚Äôs House in 1993**: At the Kings‚Äô house, Julie receives a red book used as a diary by Philippe de Commines from Stephen King. We may get a flashback from the reading of this diary to John Cabot/Bridget of York and Tudor England.

I imagine it like this:

*Dartford Priory 1498*

*A nurse runs down a corridor with a candle, it's cold and a woman is screaming in pain. She opens the door and she's told to shut it quickly and asked if anyone saw her. Prioress Cressner seems concerned with secrecy than teenage Bridget, screaming in the bed, who is being hushed by the nuns - it's clear she's a nun herself. Bridget gives birth to a girl she names Agnes. Someone calls her a princess. Everyone is sworn to secrecy. Bridget is told she can leave the baby, but she is banished.*

**Real World 2005:** All Eloise had was her mother‚Äôs bracelet, and after growing up to be Tabitha, later copies from subconscious memory and gives to Jim. This bracelet returns to Fromland with time-traveling Juli visiting the hospital to watch her birth. She then goes to Tabitha‚Äôs funeral in France, and buys Jade a soda on her way back. Ethan, who has come with Julie, is the uncle that Jade will live with in the real world now.

**Natural Disasters**: Jade‚Äôs bomb‚Äôs timer counts down and then goes off, setting off an earthquake that will fracture the ground, creating a giant hole and crumbling the town. A flood, twister, and rainstorm will follow. The rift will create whirlpool after a tidal wave.

**The Laser Battle:** Fromily will use the lighthouse‚Äôs fresnel lens to focus sun or starlight like a laser to burn the monsters.

**The Submarine:** Elgin and Randall take shelter in the remains of a British submarine, P-514, buried under the root cellar, its opening being what the hatch actually leads to - and is used as a bunker during the apocalypse. Later, they are deep underwater, seeing a giant squid, a great white shark, dolphins, porpoises, whales and a giant crab.

**The Ark**: The plane‚Äôs life raft will save people like Bhakta and Donna, and a loch-ness monster type sea serpent will chase the boat amid flare shots. A tidal wave will hit, and everything will be sucked into the hole, forming a whirlpool that pulls the boat through the core of Fromland, even where there‚Äôs no gravity, until they use a winched anchor hooked onto a tree to reel themselves back to the surface.¬†

**Journey to the Island**: Survivors in the boat will sail into an ocean following the North Star to an island. The survivors may catch a literal red herring to eat raw.

**The Lost Canadian Theme Park Tropical Island:** Jungles contain a rat-infested Canadian amusement park based on Trinity Loop in Newfoundland, with a Ferris Wheel, mini-golf, a Merry-Go-Round, four kings, teacup rides, and a roller coaster. A uniformed Mountie monster and Canadian sitcom stereotypes will be present. The town is populated by a Canadian community of ‚Äúothers,‚Äù played by former ""LOST"" cast members like Terry O‚ÄôQuinn, Josh Holloway, Matthew Fox, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Emerson, led by a woman who might be an older version of Julie, who at one time was a Danielle Rousseau-type character.

I imagine it as the survivors getting off the lifeboat, staggering into a hot jungle, stumble out into a clearing with a rundown amusement park and ferris wheel...and then a mountie rides up them, yelling at them to ‚ÄúGet inside. It's not safe in the light.‚Äù¬†

**The World‚Äôs Shape**: We‚Äôll zoom out to Fromland to see its shape: a bubble/bottle surrounding a board, with Canadian Fromland on top, and American Fromland in the upside-down. We may see all these figures playing the game, with everyone in miniature in a diorama.

**The Realm of the Dead**: By the end, nobody else is left in the town, which may have crumbled entirely. Many major characters are dead, and this round of the game is lost. The dead‚Äôs souls will be stored in trees growing from seeds. People may be shrunk into a snow globe or something like that.

Their ghosts will arrive in a black and white filmed, root-filled hellscape‚Äîa mirror-realm of the dead‚Äîfull of townsfolk ancestors and people in white or grey, including an older woman, and perhaps Michael Emerson. This will involve Cleopatra and Marc Anthony‚Äôs tomb or pyramid, with mummies. Ultimately, many of the main cast are ‚Äúon ice‚Äù until they can be resurrected. It‚Äôs likely the world of the dead is completely silent, where none can speak, but if not, the ghosts might only be able to say one word: ‚ÄúANGHKOOEY!‚Äù

**Severance Crossover and John Griffin Cameo:** Series creator John Griffin could make a surprise appearance on Severance alongside Harold Perrineau, whilst Ben Stiller and Adam Scott make an appearance on FROM. Alternately it will be in the alt-ending itself.

**Canadian Fromland Spinoff with American Actors:** MGM+ alternate seasons of release.¬†

**Time-travel Fromland Spinoff:** Includes new cast from the future and surviving cast stuck in the past. I suspect there will be a converging timeline endgame, capping everything off with a crossover feature-film with limited theatrical release finale.

**Amazon All-Star Reunion Reality TV Candid Camera Escape Room Spinoff**

Since the show first began, the Youtube Interviews have hidden a unique puzzle hidden, pointing to many, many celebrities, as well as the sequence for the finale.

It‚Äôs actually fascinating how the clues seem to point to both simultaneously ‚Äî the clues in FROM rhyme in many ways.

I theorise that a unique show has been secretly filmed in Nova Scotia, where actors from major franchises associated with Midnight Radio, Amazon Studios, Paramount, and MGM+ were discreetly invited to the exclusive event for unscripted filming. Participants signed comprehensive NDAs to ensure complete secrecy.

Lured in by an all-expenses-paid, relaxed getaway at Fox Harb‚Äôr resort for a reunion show, alongside former cast-mates as well as colleagues from other studios, the celebrities would arrive by coach in Fromtown.

I picture it as a reality-TV candid-camera ‚Äúhaunted house‚Äù prank and escape-room reunion show filmed on the existing FROM set. Unsuspecting actors would arrive by coach, while select FROM cast members may portray their actual characters. Celebrities then encouraged their friends to take part and be pranked in turn.

There‚Äôs a chance this may be a Halloween special, or it may even be a relaunched of Punk‚Äôd. The scripted television writers strikes would have helped secure all these big names if they filmed some of it in 2023.

* An extreme case of apophenia‚Äîand the only one fooling me is **myself**.

**Revised final answer:**

*Fromland is an ancestral curse that once held Ben Franklin, Frank Sinatra, the Bearded Lady, Henry Morgan and Crazy Horse, located beneath Cape Race lighthouse contained in a broken bottle of urine and holy nails wrapped in a witch‚Äôs ladder of artefacts, where medieval board and tarot games are played in mirrored Canadian and US Fromlands and a Pyramid land of the dead, between 4 angels, 7 cursed humans and the people of Gomorah, from over a dozen mythologies and religions (Christian, Greek, Hebrew, Egyptian, Arthurian/Welsh, Irish, Dante‚Äôs Hell, Heaven & Purgatory, Templar/Cathar, Norse, Iranian/Indian/Arabic, Indigenous Canadian, Modern Canadian) that began their lives as Samael, Shamsiel, Sariel and Azazel, Canaan, Cain, Lilith, Leah, Sarai, Rebekah and Rachel, with animal familiars harvesting emotions through human fluids and organs to battle in the form of Bigfoot and other evolving Canadian mythological beings, alongside time-travelling Juli and the tree-ghost of centuries-old Bridget of York, a former pregnant nun, English princess and cunning folk woman who took part in pagan international celebrations and endured a witch's trial that included a Penalty of the Peach by a mad homophobic priest who faked his death, all while marooned in Newfoundland with Dracula following an escape with her brother and pretender to the throne after he was broken out of the Tower of London by John Cabot, (whose descendants, Tabitha and Jade are unknowingly time-traveling amnesiac Eloise and Thomas) alongside the secretive order of the brotherhood of death at the behest of Philip the Handsome, spurring warring Rosicrucian orders founded by Da Vinci safeguarding and seeking objects across time (including Bridget‚Äôs (Esmerelda‚Äôs) Devil‚Äôs Forehead Urim Emerald Tablet Cathar Holy Grail Philosopher‚Äôs Graalstone once sought by a gay Jewish Nazi SS officer who loved Himmler, that was given to Elizabeth 1 by an occult magician) and passed between writers, artists, inventors, musicians, including Stephen King, Monty Python and David Bowie like a historical sisterhood of the travelling pants, inspiring works through dreams including Lost, Cthulhu, Alice in Wonderland and the Hunchback of Notre Dame ‚Äì and it was all dreamed up by John Griffin when he was trapped in Gander, Newfoundland on 9/11.*

Meanwhile, they‚Äôll proudly stand in a courtroom, hand on the Bible, swearing an oath to tell the truth, patriotically recite the Pledge of Allegiance without a second thought, and gleefully vow ‚Äútill death do us part‚Äù in a wedding ceremony.

Yeah‚Ä¶Jesus literally condemned that.

In Matthew 5:34-37, He says:
‚ÄúDo not swear at all‚Ä¶ Let your ‚ÄòYes‚Äô be ‚ÄòYes,‚Äô and your ‚ÄòNo,‚Äô ‚ÄòNo‚Äô; anything beyond this comes from evil.‚Äù

But sure, keep being beside yourself  at and condemning people saying ‚Äúd@mn‚Äù while doing the very thing Jesus called evil. Totally not hypocritical at all.

And while we‚Äôre at it, let‚Äôs clear up another one: taking the Lord‚Äôs name in vain. Its NOT actually about saying ‚ÄúOh my God.‚Äù That‚Äôs just another modern Christian invention‚Äîreducing something deeply serious into shallow moral policing.

Taking God‚Äôs name in vain is about dragging His name into your lies, your corruption, your self-serving agenda. It‚Äôs about using ‚ÄúGod‚Äù as a shield to justify evil, as a branding tool to prop up power, or as a weapon to silence those who don‚Äôt fall in line. It‚Äôs every politician who invokes ‚ÄúChristian values‚Äù while pushing policies that harm the poor, the sick, and the marginalized. It‚Äôs every televangelist who rakes in millions while preaching a prosperity gospel that Jesus would have flipped tables over. It‚Äôs every leader who claims to speak for God while spreading fear, hate, and division.

It‚Äôs the people who shout ‚ÄúJesus is King‚Äù while worshiping politicians, building laws that strip away human rights, and cheering on wars. It‚Äôs the ones who turn faith into a nationalist rallying cry, who use Christianity as an excuse for cruelty, who wave Bibles while doing the exact opposite of what Jesus taught. It‚Äôs every movement that claims divine approval for their own greed, their own power, their own interests.

So tell me, which is worse? Saying ‚Äúf*cking hell‚Äù when you drop your coffee, or hijacking God‚Äôs name to manipulate, oppress, and control?

One of these is a real sin. And it‚Äôs not the one you think. Any questions?

It's always a mix of men arguing that cold approaching never works or that they were ""told"" that women don't ever want to be approached and just want to be left alone. Or women claim that women don't ever want to be approached because¬†***they***¬†don't want to be approached or they claim that dudes don't know or when how to approach properly (valid).

The vast majority of women I've dated were through cold approaches, with a small handful through OLD and through friends. Cold approaching has been my go-to since day one. I've got phone numbers/IGs/Snapchats/etc from cashiers, grocery store workers, at gyms, coffee shops, at bars, on the bus or the subway, all kinds of places. Hell, I got the most numbers ever in my life as a grocery store stocker because women would make conversation with me and it gave me a chance to spit game if I was feeling them. Sure, I've been brushed off¬†and rejected ***dozens***¬†of times and even if I get a number it doesn't always materialize into something but that's just how dating works. Most of my friends only date primarily through cold approaches or OLD same as I do.

Granted, there are situations when you shouldn't approach someone, but 99% of them can be recognized with some pretty basic nonverbal cues. People make it glaringly obvious when they don't want to be approached or flirted with. Even me, a high-functioning autistic man, can interpret when someone doesn't want to be bothered or just isn't feeling me. But people online act like a decent cold approach is tantamount to sexual harassment, that it never works or only works for insanely hot people, or that bothering a woman in public is the worst thing any guy could do.

In my opinion, if you:

* Can read basic verbal and non-verbal social cues
* Are a good sport, can handle rejection, and understand how and when to disengage
* Have decent conversational skills; you don't need to be a conversationalist
* Can accept that you can't talk to everyone and some people just aren't for you
* Can tactfully make conversation without coming off as pushy or aggressive

/tldr  Probably the best \*work\* headset for a digital nomad or someone on the go who moves/travels with minimalism and needs something highly portable focused more on working versus listening. No major issues - highly recommended!

\----

I never think about the battery and use it for a week or so... 30+ hours is the rating without active noise canceling/pass through turned on. now to be clear, I don't really ever use the noise canceling and I am guessing it probably doesn't work that great anyway vs something that seals completely over the ear because it does not truly cover the ear completely. I primarily use it for the folding capability and the good microphone noise canceling. I do love this company's channel that does headset reviews and you can definitely get other ideas there if you're looking for more of a working/meeting headset versus a ""I want to block out the world type of headset"".¬†

[https://youtu.be/syyvA4eUmdk?si=qAXu37bEzBT7o4-3](https://youtu.be/syyvA4eUmdk?si=qAXu37bEzBT7o4-3)

The sound samples are towards the end of the video with different background noises. I personally tested the blender thing at one point when I wasn't traveling and it worked just like the video. my only minor quibbles is the little arm can be finicky and I need to raise it and lower it to turn it on right when I first start because it sometimes misses and seems partially muted. also, wind seems to be a bit of a weakness and it does pick that up and not do so great. sometimes I'll need to start moving during a meeting and even a slow bike speed is enough to get background wind noise.¬†

I love the folding. I love the multi-device support so I can switch between phone and laptop automatically. I've been using it now for almost 2 years and I've replaced the ear cups once recently and have a second set of cups for next time I picked up while traveling in Vietnam (shopee).

Lost my little pouch and picked up a heavier replacement I modified to work from a little stall in Thailand last trip. Too bad cannot find a replacement anywhere - would happily buy for the combination of light weight and fit but pretty much impossible to find anywhere in SEA appears. Also lost the usb-c dongle at the same time. üò¢

Anyway, I'm confident enough with the headset that I have been in meetings and transition from taxi to a little bit of street walking to a coffee shop and have never worried once about the background noise and that someone would ask me where I was because that specific trip I didn't even let them know I was traveling and nobody was the wiser. I never mute anymore as I know I will remain in stealth... üòÜ

I do tend to use them if I suspect I might fall asleep on a plane because earbuds roll around on the floor if they fall out. normally though for general usage I will use the earbuds but I do listen to audio book or ASMR or background white-noise type things during work a lot while using them. I am not picky about sound quality so I can't really compare versus quality music/sound focused headset/headphones.

It wasn‚Äôt your imagination: Something was off about the food from the start.

That first glimpse of cantaloupe and honeydew, arranged in the office to welcome Helly R., played by Britt Lower, was a little unnerving: melons in jagged halves ‚Äî severed! ‚Äî filled with anemic, out-of-season fruit.

‚ÄúSeverance,‚Äù the Apple TV+ show written by Dan Erickson and executive produced by Ben Stiller, follows a group of Lumon Industries employees with chips in their brains that divide their work selves (‚Äúinnies‚Äù) from their main selves (‚Äúouties‚Äù). For innies, whose lives are confined to the office, who never sleep or see the sun, a snack is a treat. So why doesn‚Äôt it feel like one?

The food on ‚ÄúSeverance‚Äù leaves a bad taste in your mouth because it‚Äôs as fluent in doublespeak as the show‚Äôs most ambitious corporate climbers. In the show‚Äôs second season, which wraps up this week, food has acquired all the chilling, spine-tingling dissonance of upper management, refusing your request for a raise with a warm, unflinching smile.

‚ÄúMelon has been a theme over the two seasons, and each time we see it, we want to up the ante,‚Äù said Catherine Miller, the prop master for ‚ÄúSeverance.‚ÄùCredit...Apple TV+

‚ÄúI always try to design the props and food to have some connection, some metaphorical undertone,‚Äù said Catherine Miller, the show‚Äôs prop master, who devised Season 1‚Äôs melon presentation to fit the ‚Äúvery graphic, very minimal‚Äù aesthetic of Lumon‚Äôs retro office. ‚ÄúI think food has the ability to define time and place and mood and overall emotional connection ‚Äî it can become its own character.‚Äù

As a character, the food on ‚ÄúSeverance‚Äù never says what it means and never means what it says. Food at the office might be packaged as an employee perk, a reward for meeting project goals, but even a stack of golden waffles dripping with maple syrup is only there to enforce compliance.

At Lumon, food is manipulation, suppression, distraction. The company barely acknowledges hunger: Vending machines on the severed floor are filled with small portions of boring snacks like dried blueberries and sunflower seeds. Food takes the sharpest edge off an appetite, but never satisfies it.

On a corporate trip, known in Lumon‚Äôs parlance as an Outdoor Retreat and Team-Building Occurrence (ORTBO), the team laughs at their manager Mr. Milchick, portrayed by Tramell Tillman, and his dramatic reading of Lumon‚Äôs mythology. Punishment is instantaneous. ‚ÄúThe marshmallows, please,‚Äù Mr. Milchick commands. ‚ÄúThrow them in the fire.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe knew we wanted the marshmallows to be special,‚Äù said Ms. Miller, whose team made the thick, rectangular confections from scratch, printing them with images of the Lumon founder Kier Eagan‚Äôs face using food-grade ink in a precise shade of Macro Data Refinement blue. ‚ÄúWe tend to do angular instead of circular for the Brutalist aesthetic.‚Äù

The excitement of food withheld, or deployed, at just the right moment is a tactic, an attempt to redirect characters from big, inconvenient feelings like defiance, curiosity, love or grief. The melon bar is first wheeled out to temper Helly R.‚Äôs outrage after she tries unsuccessfully to quit her job at Lumon.

Later, a more elaborate melon bar appears when Burt, the head of Optics and Design on the severed floor, played by Christopher Walken, is forced into retirement, ending his budding workplace romance with Irving, played by John Turturro. After Irving is fired, the team shares a horrific watermelon carved in the shape of his head, part of Lumon‚Äôs ‚Äúbereavement kit.‚Äù

For innies, who exist only in the office, termination is death. But Lumon seems to think that melon can manage the full spectrum of their emotions, prescribing it as needed.

‚ÄúMelon has been a theme over the two seasons, and each time we see it, we want to up the ante,‚Äù Ms. Miller said.

To create the eerie watermelon head, Penko Platikanov, the show‚Äôs sculptor, carved melons for a week. He used the dark skin of the fruit to form the hair, letting the white rind peep out at the nose. But each time he got down to the details of Mr. Turturro‚Äôs face, the texture was too mushy for definition, the water content too high.

In the end, Mr. Platikanov turned to lacquered foam for a realistic and unsettling wet look. Though for a scene where Dylan, played by Zach Cherry, eats some of the funereal watermelon, the team carved about 16 ears out of real fruit.

One glimpse inside the Eagan family‚Äôs home and it‚Äôs clear how their neuroses ‚Äî their fear and avoidance of messy emotions and appetites ‚Äî have trickled down, shaping the entire corporation‚Äôs ideology.

The penultimate episode opens with Helena Eagan, the daughter of Lumon‚Äôs chief executive, in the middle of her tightly controlled morning routine: a swim followed by a cup of coffee and a single egg, cut into six identical wedges.

‚ÄúThe egg was endowed with a lot of subtext,‚Äù said Ms. Miller, who trialed different tools and settled on a vintage wire cutter for the scene, which was shot with dozens and dozens of real hard-boiled eggs (before the current egg shortage). ‚ÄúWe wanted a very violent ritual.‚Äù

She opens the severed egg on a piece of luxurious china with a menacing image of a child restrained in a chair. (That plate was a rare vintage find, Ms. Miller said, and unlike the endless supply of eggs, she only had one.)

As Helena eats the egg, in tiny bites, with great restraint, her father watches and criticizes her: ‚ÄúI wish you‚Äôd take them raw,‚Äù he says, in reference to Kier Eagan‚Äôs breakfast of three raw eggs. Helena is technically free, but her mornings are a warped mirror of Gemma‚Äôs, Lumon‚Äôs tortured test subject.

Gemma, played by Dichen Lachman, has her own exercise program and a daily menu of carefully curated foods. A drawer of Lumon branded pods holds all of her meals: rows of processed starches, meats and vegetables, manipulated beyond recognition.

The labels suggest flavors and textures the pods are unlikely to deliver, like ‚Äúflaky dinner roll,‚Äù ‚Äúrendered marrow‚Äù and ‚Äúcandied carrots.‚Äù Garnishes like ‚Äúapple blossoms‚Äù give the final plates the look of a generic fine-dining dish from the early days of molecular gastronomy.

‚ÄúShe can mix and match the foods so she has a little bit of ownership, but no control,‚Äù said Ms. Miller, who took visual inspiration from some of the food-pod startups on the market today, along with the food trays in ‚Äú2001: A Space Odyssey.‚Äù

These meals aren‚Äôt supposed to delight. Like that very first melon bar ‚Äî would you like the green tasteless melon or the orange tasteless melon? ‚Äî food maintains an illusion of pleasure and choice for Lumon‚Äôs most vulnerable captives, who aren‚Äôt supposed to experience pleasure on their own terms, or to make real choices. Not at meal time, not ever.

But a little treat obscures the full extent of the company‚Äôs control, and obscuring control is essential to maintaining it.",2,1742427466.0,severence,0,0.75,False

The other day I went to a Dutch Bros. Coffee with my mom. We put in our order beforehand and walk up to the window to retrieve it. There's some other people there, including a woman with a smallish, maybe young pitbull mix. Medium sized brown dog with a big head. 

It's fine, everyone there is engaged in conversation, one of the people is petting the dog. She tries telling it to spin but it keeps offering its paw, so it's not super well trained. Shortly, everyone else leaves with their drinks and leaves the woman and her dog with my mom and I. 

She gets called up, is served two drinks and the barista asks if she wants a pup cup and she of course says yes. I mean, why else would she take her dog to the coffee place? The employee fixes her a small cup of whipped cream and gives it to her and she starts trying to pick everything up, and her dog starts pulling on the leash. She doesn't have a great hold on it and keeps telling it ""They don't want to say hello to you!"" ""They don't want to say hello to you!"" as she struggles to pick up two large drinks and balance the little cup of whipped cream and hold the dog's leash. When she stepped up to get her drinks, I stepped off the little concrete step by the window, just to put distance between me and the dog, and I kept taking little steps.

Then the dog sniffs a little and all of a sudden starts barking its head off. She starts yelling at it ""THEY DON'T WANNA SAY HELLO TO YOU!"" as she drags it away to her car and when she gets to the car she starts trying to tell it to sit or something. My mom and I get our drinks a few minutes later and after a little complaining from the both of us my mom saying something like ""Trying to shame us into saying hello to your dog"".

No, I don't want to say hello to your dog. Especially not when it's poorly trained and loud, and potentially dangerous. This thing sensed my fear, and wanted to attack. Dog nutters will say ""Oh dogs can sense evil!"" ""They know if you're a bad person"" And I don't know about that but they can sense if you're afraid of them and they want to take advantage of that.",38,1742427383.0,Dogfree,12,0.98,False

I met my ex-partner when we were both 23 (3 years ago now). We started chatting on a dating app, as most people do these days, we hit it off straight away and met up for a coffee soon after. We were both so nervous but at the same time we just clicked and it wasn't long before we were going on on a date or two every week. After a few weeks, he took me out to a beautiful nature spot near to where we live and asked me to be his girlfriend. As our relationship continued we spent more and more time together, becoming integral parts of each other's lives. We became a team, going on weekend trips, visiting each other's family, having nights in cooking for each other, and trying out new restaurants where we live. It was bliss.

Now there was a singular event that essentially ended this relationship that is very relevant to my current confusion - Nine months in, things were going strong and it was coming up to Christmas. Unfortunately, I got really ill with COVID meaning that we didn't get to spend the time together that we'd been anticipating, I even missed a Christmas party at his family's house which I was disappointed about but didn't think too much of since I'd likely be seeing him for New Year's, an event we'd been discussing for months as it was really important to me (hoping that I'd feel better by then). Christmas came and went and it was a lovely day spent with my family but sadly the day after the big event my family dog (14y) got ill with pancreatitis and died a day or two later. I along with the rest of my family were devastated - this was our first ever dog and he meant the world to each and every one of us. I completely detached from the world and spent about 4 days just in bed trying to process my grief. On the fifth day I woke up and realised that I hadn't texted my partner at all, since the morning that I'd informed him that my Dog had to be put down. It made me a bit anxious because we usually talked all day via text but I figured he'd understand. When I did reach out, something just felt a bit off about our back-and-forth, but I put it to the back of my mind.

Not too long it was the morning of New Year's - our first New Year's eve we were going to spend together - I was feeling a swell of excitement, but all of a sudden he texted me to cancel, saying that he would spend it with his parents (a 45 minute drive away) instead. I was confused. I was angry. I was pissed. But I WAS CONFUSED. It was just so unexpected and just threw me completely. This whole thing ate at me throughout the day and as the evening approached I decided that in the spirit of good communication, I would call him to ask about his last-minute change of heart. The minute he picked up I knew something was wrong. He sounded awful, his voice was husky/strained. As we talked he informed me that because he had not heard from me for this 5-day period over x-mas he just assumed that I had ended our relationship and in his distress he had gone to stay with his parents because he didn't want ""to do anything stupid"". I asked him directly, so he'd been wanting to hurt himself? Yes.

Now for some background, I have always struggled with depression and anxiety and this manifested itself in my teen years as a lot of SH of all kinds. When I met my ex this was only just behind me, I was working hard every day to maintain my sobriety. So, when I heard this man, a man who I loved with all my heart tell me that I'd made him want to hurt himself, I became inconsolable. Hysterical. This just blew up my whole world. I played the situation over and over again in my mind, trying to think about how we could move forward and honestly I didn't think we could. I needed to protect the man I loved and that meant getting him away from me. So the following day I ended the relationship.

I had always hoped that we would find each other again - when we separated I didn't say that I hated his guts and never wanted anything to do with him ever again, just that ""I don't think you're ready to be in a relationship right now"". But we haven't found each other again. It's been almost three years now, I tried to date again but it hasn't gone well. I feel as though every time I go on these bloody apps I am just looking for him. It's awful. My therapist told me shortly after we separated that it would get easier with time but it hasn't, if anything its gotten worse - I have had so many things happen in my life that I want to tell him about, I want to ask how he's doing at University. It just all feels wrong.

As of today, I feel like I am at a crossroads - I believe this person was someone who I could have married, I want to respect their wishes to not contact me. But at the same time, I wonder what he thinks about me and why he has chosen not to make any contact since? Does he stay away because he hates me for what I did to us or because he thinks I hate him. I'm too scared to approach him to ask the question. I'm scared that I'll never have the guts to send that message and in my terror I might have killed the greatest light and happiness that ever came into my life.

I am wanting to purchase a vintage truck and operate a mobile build your own bouquet bar. I wanted to set up around my town on weekend mornings, possibly near farmers markets or festivals, and also have the option to be rented out for bridal showers, weddings, baby showers, etc. 
The price would be per stem and bouquets would be wrapped for free, or an additional cost for a glass vase if wanted. 
I was thinking of partnering up with local coffee shops to draw in business for both of parties and as a side gig, I was going to try to rent out the truck to local photographers to use for photography sessions. 
While I‚Äôm not a true florist (yet,) I do have some experience with flowers already and have the logistics on where the flowers will be purchased from.

I am using a flow-control device on my ECM to pre-infuse (usually between 12-15 seconds) and then open it up to a full nine-bar. Do you guys start timing your shot from when you open it up or from the start of the pull? I realize that at this level, I'm worrying less about timing and more about the actual flow / flavor / etc., but I'm still somewhat new at this and I do like to use timing to at least get a baseline for dialing in a coffee. 

Right now, I still try to shoot for a 28 - 34 second pour that I start timing after I open up the flow. From there, I can try to fine tune the flavor / texture / etc. and I care less about time timing. Just wondering how everyone else is timing these shots.

1jfax76,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jfax76/body_snatcher/,Body Snatcher,"I stared down at the freshly dug hollow pit in front of me which had once been a grave. The mahogany casket, once occupied, now lay vacant at the bottom of the six foot hole. 

'And you didn't see anyone last night?' The officer asked me, writing something down in his notebook. 

I shook my head, defeated. I'm a night cemetery guard for a churchyard in the sleepy town of Orlingdale, England. Aside from shooing off the occasional group of teenagers or escorting lost mourners out of the grounds, nothing like this had ever happened at my job. 

'I don't understand who would do this,' The vicar growled behind me as the police gathered their evidence and left after promising they'd patrol the area tonight. 'What horrid person would steal a body? This is despicable.' 

He put his arm on my shoulder, reassuringly. 'You won't be working alone tonight,' He told me. 'I've called Vincent and told him what happened. He's assured me he'll be here tonight to patrol with you.' 

....

I walked through the tall iron gates of the churchyard to see Vince sat on a bench, an unlit cigarette perched between his lips. He looked up at me and smiled, holding out his open pack of smokes to offer me one. 

'Weird fuckin' thing to do, y'know,' he muttered, flicking his lighter and raising it to his mouth. 'Robbin' a grave for a corpse.' 

I nodded in agreement, taking a long drag of my cigarette. Vince was a younger man in his early 30's. He was tall and skinny, with a head of floppy blonde hair. He and I were both hired as night guards at around the same time a year ago, but we'd often be working different nights so never really got a chance to properly talk. 

I exhaled a cloud of smoke. 'Think they'll come back?' 

'Nah,' Vince replied confidently. 'Have to be pretty dumb to return to the scene of the crime the next day.'

We patrolled the grounds for hours, occasionally splitting up and linking back up to cover more ground. I began to relax as 3am rolled around, thinking Vince was probably right that they wouldn't come back. 

We eventually ended up stood on a small hill which overlooked most of the churchyard. The steeple towered in the distance as if trying to intimidate anyone who entered into its yard. 

'Are you a religious man?' I asked Vincent, who shrugged. 

'Nah, not really. Are you?' 

I shook my head. 

'Then what the fuck are we doin' workin' 'ere!' Vince laughed loudly, pulling out his pack of cigarettes. 

'We buried my sister here,' he told me, still looking off into the distance. 'We lost her in an accident, just before I started working here actually.' 

I looked at him and nodded understandingly. 

'It's a big reason I took the job,' he continued. 'Means every night that I'm not at home, I'm 'ere with her.' 

We smoked in comfortable silence for a while, finishing off our cigarettes and stubbing them out in a nearby bin. 

'What was her name?' I asked him. 

Vince looked at me, his warm blue eyes flickering with a momentary vulnerability. 

'Mila,' he replied. 'Mila Blossom Evans. She was only 19 when she died, family ain't been the same since.' 

'I can imagine.' I comforted him. 

Vince opened his mouth to speak, but was cut off by a loud metallic noise coming from the corner of the yard. 

'The fuck was that?' Vince asked in a hushed tone. 

We aimed our flashlights in the direction of the sound. A bush outside of the iron fence rustled hastily. 

'An animal?' I whispered, unable to hide the nervousness in my voice. 

We cautiously walked over to the disturbed shrubbery. 

'Look.' Vince pointed. I followed his hand to see one of the iron bars of the fence hanging limply. 

'That must be where our grave robbers been getting in.' Vince hissed. 

Our eyes met as the terrible realisation hit us like a train. 

'They aren't breaking in, they've just taken something *out.'*

We both turned and split up, trying to find the grave which had just been emptied. 

I pulled out my phone to call the police, when I heard a pained scream. I almost dropped my phone as I sprinted over to Vince, who was on his knees. 

'*Vince!'* I shouted, as I spotted him on his knees with his head to the floor. 

As I ran closer, I could hear his muffled sobs. I looked over to the freshly dug hole which sat in front of him. 

'What happened, are you hurt?' I whispered as I walked closer to him. That's when I saw the familiar name on the headstone. 

  
....

  
The police came and went, yet again taking a statement and promising to patrol. 

'More should be done,' I snapped, annoyed. 'Why aren't detectives coming to take evidence, why aren't-' 

'I know, I know,' the vicar said softly. 'Remember this is a small town. They're doing what they can for now. Forensics have already been, but we're such an isolated town. We just have to trust they're doing their best.' 

'But what about-' 

'Vincent?' The old vicar finished my sentence. 'I've insisted he go home and have some time off.' 

The vicar stepped closer to me. 'He doesn't have any family. His sister was all he had, I can't imagine what he's feeling. I'll be joining you on watch tonight while he's away. The police have searched the perimeter and secured any openings in the fence, nothing will get in or out without us knowing. ' 

....

Raised voices filled the evening atmosphere as I entered the cold iron gates of the churchyard. 

'You should be at home resting, you've no reason to be here tonight.' The vicar said sternly.

'She was my sister. I want to be here, I *need* to be here.' Vince replied sharply. 

'This isn't helping anyone, please go home.' The vicar told him. 

I walked up to them and cleared my throat. 

'Ah, thank goodness you're here,' the vicar gestured to me. 'Vincent just arrived and I've told him he should be home resting. Could you-' 

'No, I gotta be here to catch this prick.' Vince looked at me, his voice slightly breaking. 'She was my fuckin' sister, man.' 

A wave of sympathy washed over me as I remembered what the vicar had told me last night. 

'I mean, we could use all the help we can get,' I suggested. 'Three people is better than two.' 

Vince turned to look at the vicar, his blue eyes filled with desperation and pleading. 

The vicar sighed. 

'I'm not trying to be malicious, I'm just thinking about what's best for you. If you really want to stay, I can't force you to go. But I really think it's best if you were at home recovering emotionally.' 

Vince nodded. 'I'd like to stay.' 

....

  
'What do you think you're doing, stop that at once!' 

I shone my flashlight in the direction of the vicar's voice in the distance and began running towards him. 

The vicar stood on the grass with his phone to his ear. In front of him, a short man dressed in all black stood over a grave which had been partially dug into. The man stood with his hands raised in the air and a shovel at his feet. His facial details were impossible to make out due to the black ski mask over his head. 

'Please-' The man pleaded in an accent I couldn't place. 

'Now you just wait there, the police are on their way.' The vicar told him sternly. 

I felt a rush of wind as Vince lunged past me and tackled the man. 

'Stop it, now stop it!' The old vicar yelled as Vince began throwing punches. 

The vicar grabbed Vince by the shoulders and attempted to pry him from the man, who had curled himself into a ball to protect himself from the blows. 

I grabbed Vince's other shoulder and we managed to pull him off his prey. 

During the scuffle, Vince had unmasked the grave robber. He looked to be in his 40's, with short dark hair and brown eyes. He was sweating heavily'  

'Please,' the man begged. 

'What's your name?' The vicar wanted to know. 

'Andres,' the man responded nervously. 'Andres Rivera.' 

'And what are you doing in my churchyard every night digging up the deceased?' The vicar demanded.

'Please,' Andres repeated. 'It will kill me.' 

'What are you talking about?' 

Andres took a breath, still sitting on the floor with his legs to his chest. 

'It followed me over here... I fled from the Philippines. It followed.'

'Who followed you?' The vicar asked, looking confused. 

'It smelled the death on me,' Andres continued. 'I have an illness, not long left.' 

Andres noticeably shuddered, clutching his legs closer to his chest like a scared toddler. 

'I ran away, but it came after me. It found me. I feed it to keep it away. Please, it will kill me.' 

'I don't understand,' the vicar spoke up. 'What's come after you?' 

Andres looked up at him, his eyes wide. 

'Bal-Bal.' 

'I beg your pardon?' The vicar asked, leaning closer to the terrified Andres. 

'Bal-Bal,' Andres repeated, a tremble in his voice. 'In my home town in the Philippines, we were told stories as children about the creature that steals corpses and stalks the dying. I thought it was just stories, but then I got ill. I heard it every night on my roof. I smelled its putrid rotten odour. I saw its evil face at my window waiting for me to die so it can-' 

Andres was abruptly cut off by Vince. 

'This is bullshit,' Vince snapped. 'Why are we listening to this weirdo's bollocks story. He's obviously fuckin' insane and eating corpses.' 

'No, no,' Andres shook his head violently. 'I wouldn't... I only took what was necessary.' 

'Yeah, you took my fuckin' sister,' Vince spat, a malicious look in his eyes. 'There's a lotta empty graves here I could fill...'

'No, please. I'm sorry, I- I didn't know, I- please don't. I'm sorry.' 

I held my arm up to block Vince, who looked like he wanted to resume his attack on the snivelling Andres. 

'You don't understand what it's like!' Andres yelled with a broken voice. 'I have my final months in fear of this creature. I will not know peace.' 

'Now, calm down.' The vicar instructed. 'The police are pulling up now. Vincent, go and unlock the gate.' 

'Police, no. No!' Andres shouted desperately. 'I need to feed it, I can't-'

'That's enough now please,' The vicar said assertively. 'You're clearly unwell. I hope you get the care you need.' 

The three of us stood back and watched Andres be led away in handcuffs, his cries and pleas falling on deaf ears. 

....

I woke up feeling a sense of accomplishment. There was a spring in my step as I flicked my bread into the toaster and poured a cup of coffee.

I practically skipped to work that day, relieved that this shift will be as uneventful and mind numbingly boring as it was before. 

Vince volunteered to work with me tonight, ignoring the vicar's advice to take some time away. 

The hours practically flew by as we trudged up and down the gravelly paths. 

And then, I smelt it. A putrid smell, as if I'd walked into a tomb of a hundred rotting bodies. 

'What the fuck?' I choked, covering my nose. 

Vince shone his flashlight around. 'What's that smell, I'm gonna puke!' He spat, clasping his hand over his mouth. 

A shadow briefly covered the moon. 

'What was that?' I asked, looking up into the crisp night sky for anything out of the ordinary. 

'Up there.' Vince pointed to a dark figure balanced on the tiles of the steeple. 

'What the fuck, who's that?' I whispered. 

'It's fucking Andres,' Vince snapped. 'I'm gonna kill him!' 

'I don't think Andres could get up there,' I said, the nervousness I'd been pushing down escaping into my voice. 'I don't think anyone could get up there.' 

Vince's face turned from fury to fear as he realised what I was saying. 

Before either of us could say another word, the figure quickly scaled down the steeple roof with a natural ease no human could manage. As it reached the roof of the church building, it extended its long arms and glided out of sight. 

I looked at Vince. His face was pale, and his wide eyes remained locked on where the creature had gone. 

'We need to leave.' I whispered, terrified. 

'Our only way out is past where that thing went.' Vince replied, his voice haunting and hollow. 

I cursed when I remembered the opening in the fence that Andres had used, which had now been sealed off. 

'I say we run for it,' Vince whispered. 'Don't look back, just run to the gate.' 

'What, no way!' I hissed. 

'Then what? You wanna wait in here with this fuckin' thing?' Vince hissed back. 

'Call the police,' I told Vince. 'They'll help us.' 

Vince went quiet for a moment, before confessing. 'I never take my phone to work. No point, who am I gonna message? Only person I had that meant anything's gone. I got you, but I'd feel like a twat messaging you on your nights off.' 

I frantically dug my phone from my pocket, my hand shaking so hard I could barely type in my passcode. 

The loud sound of a branch breaking behind us propelled us into fight or flight, Vince grabbing my sleeve and pulling me, causing me to drop my phone as we fled.

We ducked behind a large headstone in the middle of the yard, gasping for breath. 

'Vince, I dropped the phone.' I whispered, frantic. 

'Ahh, *fuck*. It's ok.' Vince tried to calm me, although I could hear the masked desperation in his voice. 

'Can you see it?' I asked him, too scared to move from the false safety of our limestone cover. 

'I'll check.' Vince slowly and silently rose onto his knees, building up the courage to peer around the grave. 

I felt my stomach tighten suddenly. I tried to force myself to take a deep breath, but it felt as though my abdomen were in a vice. I reached down to clasp the pressure in my side, when my hand met something wet, cold and unfamiliar. I looked down. 

Gripping my thick winter coat was a grey, slimy bony clawed hand. 

'*Vince!'* I screamed, frantically squirming out of the creatures clutch. 

Vince looked over at me, before looking back and becoming face to face with the putrid creature. It then stood upright and towered over us as we began desperately crawling backwards. 

It was tall, with dark crimson eyes, yellow rotten teeth and a disgustingly long tongue which seemed to lap hungrily at its chest. Its skin was a horrible greenish grey, and it's arms were connected to its entire torso by a tight flap of skin, similar to a bat. Its limbs looked almost human, with five long, sickly fingers all accompanied by filthy, bloodied claws. 

And the smell. The creature smelled like the pinnacle of decomposition. It's hot breath filling our lungs with the unescapable stench of death. 

Vince grabbed my arm, pulling me up. '*Come on!'*

He pulled me along as we weaved in between headstones. Tears clouded my vision and my trousers felt cold and heavy where I had unknowingly lost control of my bladder.

Vince suddenly tripped, sending us both hurtling forwards mid sprint. I fell hard onto the gravelly floor, feeling a burning pain in my hand which had been scraped under my body weight. 

'Vince,' I whispered, groggily pulling myself up and turning to look at him. 'We have to ke-' 

My heart dropped when I saw Vince, lying motionless on the grass next to a hollow grave, a large wound across his head. 

I looked at the bloodied headstone beside him. 

**Mila Blossom Evans, forever 19**

**Beloved sister and friend. A short life lived to the fullest.** 

'Vince?' My voice quaked as I crouched over him and shook his lifeless body. 'Vince? *Vince, please!'* I begged him. 

But Vince never got up. The empty look in his glassy blue eyes telling me his soul had left. 

I wiped my tear soaked cheek with my sleeve and began hurriedly backing away as the creature slowly began to crawl along the gravel path towards Vance's body. 

'No...' I mustered as it cocooned his carcass with its fleshy wings '*No!'* 

The creature plunged its salivating tongue into Vince's eye socket, not even looking at me. I froze, sheer terror forbidding me from vomiting with disgust. The creatures sharp claws tore the clothes from Vince's body effortlessly as it began to rip away at his flesh. 

I backed up in horror until I felt a familiar stone wall behind me. The church. I looked to the left to see the tall iron gates willing me towards them. I took one last look back at the creature. 

It locked eyes with me, as its long tongue was preoccupied consuming Vance's body. It had a look of hatred in its eyes, as if it despised me for still living. 

I turned towards the gate and fled, not even stopping to unlock the heavy padlock. I gripped the iron bars tightly, forcing my foot on top of the bolts of the gate as I clambered up. I threw my leg over and collapsed from the top of the gate, landing hard on my feet. Ignoring the pain in my ankles, I desperately sprinted to the closest house I could find; the vicars'. 

I must've ran for about twenty minutes without stopping, practically kicking the vicars' garden gate off its hinges as I pounded on his door. 

A face peaked at me from the window, before a startled vicar opened the door in his pyjamas. 

'What's happened, are you ok? What's going on?' He asked, panicked. 

Everything began spinning as I collapsed into his front door as he tried to catch me. 

....

 I woke up the next afternoon in a hospital bed. After having myself discharged, I used the hospital phone to call a taxi to the vicars house. I knocked on his door, less frantic this time. 

He opened the door in a pair of blue jeans and a relaxed cardigan, looking surprised to see me. 

'Oh, you're out already? You should've called. Come in.' 

 We sat in his living room and I told him everything that had happened that night. 

'Yes, I'm sorry to hear about Vincent. I know he was fond of you, you were a friend to him.' The vicar sympathised. 

'Would you mind sitting with me while I recount all this to the police?' I asked him. 'I'm worried I'll forget some of the details I told you.' 

'Oh, I don't think we need to tell them any of that,' the vicar shook his head. 'Andres was let out on bail last night, let's just say he came back and did all of this.' 

My mouth fell open. 'W-what do you mean?' I asked him. 

The vicar shrugged. 'Well, I don't think the town needs to hear about this demonic being.' 

The vicar leaned forward in his chair. 'Can you imagine what this will do to my church if the members hear a satanic creature taunts the churchyard, it will destroy their faith.' 

My eyes widened. The vicar's expression softened. 'Relax,' he said calmly. 'I'm not making a threat. I'll make a deal. You keep quiet about this, and I'll pay you for helping me.' 

'But what about the-' I began.

'The demon? It will lose interest and go elsewhere. Andres said it's following him, chances are it will go back to where it came from once it has him. It doesn't seem to be able to dig the graves up by itself here.' 

I looked at him, anxious. 

'I've always been good to you. I gave you and Vincent jobs when nobody else would. The money I'll transfer to you, we'll call it compensation for what you had to go through at my church. Pretend it's money for therapy or whatnot. Then you can finally get yourself a little place in the city, like you've always talked about. All I need is for you to let me do the talking...'

  
....

I gazed out my window, the vibrant life of the city radiating through my apartment. 

I left my home in Orlingdale that same week, choosing to remain quiet and let the vicar tell the authorities whatever story he could come up with. 

The vicar sent me a letter last week. It was brief, with no mention of the incident at all. He mentioned Andres had sadly passed away recently. I looked him up online to see if there were any details about him and found a small news article from the towns local paper. It reported that Andres body was being flown back to his hometown by his family, and nothing more.  I stuffed the letter into my desk drawer, having no desire to respond. 

It's been 3 months since the incident, and nobody's reported seeing the creature since. Maybe it went back to the Philippines with Andres, maybe it stuck around, maybe it moved on to a different country altogether. 

I don't know.

1jfawnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jfawnv/body_snatcher/,Body Snatcher,"I stared down at the freshly dug hollow pit in front of me which had once been a grave. The mahogany casket, once occupied, now lay vacant at the bottom of the six foot hole. 

'And you didn't see anyone last night?' The officer asked me, writing something down in his notebook. 

I shook my head, defeated. I'm a night cemetery guard for a churchyard in the sleepy town of Orlingdale, England. Aside from shooing off the occasional group of teenagers or escorting lost mourners out of the grounds, nothing like this had ever happened at my job. 

'I don't understand who would do this,' The vicar growled behind me as the police gathered their evidence and left after promising they'd patrol the area tonight. 'What horrid person would steal a body? This is despicable.' 

He put his arm on my shoulder, reassuringly. 'You won't be working alone tonight,' He told me. 'I've called Vincent and told him what happened. He's assured me he'll be here tonight to patrol with you.' 

....

I walked through the tall iron gates of the churchyard to see Vince sat on a bench, an unlit cigarette perched between his lips. He looked up at me and smiled, holding out his open pack of smokes to offer me one. 

'Weird fuckin' thing to do, y'know,' he muttered, flicking his lighter and raising it to his mouth. 'Robbin' a grave for a corpse.' 

I nodded in agreement, taking a long drag of my cigarette. Vince was a younger man in his early 30's. He was tall and skinny, with a head of floppy blonde hair. He and I were both hired as night guards at around the same time a year ago, but we'd often be working different nights so never really got a chance to properly talk. 

I exhaled a cloud of smoke. 'Think they'll come back?' 

'Nah,' Vince replied confidently. 'Have to be pretty dumb to return to the scene of the crime the next day.'

We patrolled the grounds for hours, occasionally splitting up and linking back up to cover more ground. I began to relax as 3am rolled around, thinking Vince was probably right that they wouldn't come back. 

We eventually ended up stood on a small hill which overlooked most of the churchyard. The steeple towered in the distance as if trying to intimidate anyone who entered into its yard. 

'Are you a religious man?' I asked Vincent, who shrugged. 

'Nah, not really. Are you?' 

I shook my head. 

'Then what the fuck are we doin' workin' 'ere!' Vince laughed loudly, pulling out his pack of cigarettes. 

'We buried my sister here,' he told me, still looking off into the distance. 'We lost her in an accident, just before I started working here actually.' 

I looked at him and nodded understandingly. 

'It's a big reason I took the job,' he continued. 'Means every night that I'm not at home, I'm 'ere with her.' 

We smoked in comfortable silence for a while, finishing off our cigarettes and stubbing them out in a nearby bin. 

'What was her name?' I asked him. 

Vince looked at me, his warm blue eyes flickering with a momentary vulnerability. 

'Mila,' he replied. 'Mila Blossom Evans. She was only 19 when she died, family ain't been the same since.' 

'I can imagine.' I comforted him. 

Vince opened his mouth to speak, but was cut off by a loud metallic noise coming from the corner of the yard. 

'The fuck was that?' Vince asked in a hushed tone. 

We aimed our flashlights in the direction of the sound. A bush outside of the iron fence rustled hastily. 

'An animal?' I whispered, unable to hide the nervousness in my voice. 

We cautiously walked over to the disturbed shrubbery. 

'Look.' Vince pointed. I followed his hand to see one of the iron bars of the fence hanging limply. 

'That must be where our grave robbers been getting in.' Vince hissed. 

Our eyes met as the terrible realisation hit us like a train. 

'They aren't breaking in, they've just taken something *out.'*

We both turned and split up, trying to find the grave which had just been emptied. 

I pulled out my phone to call the police, when I heard a pained scream. I almost dropped my phone as I sprinted over to Vince, who was on his knees. 

'*Vince!'* I shouted, as I spotted him on his knees with his head to the floor. 

As I ran closer, I could hear his muffled sobs. I looked over to the freshly dug hole which sat in front of him. 

'What happened, are you hurt?' I whispered as I walked closer to him. That's when I saw the familiar name on the headstone. 

  
....

  
The police came and went, yet again taking a statement and promising to patrol. 

'More should be done,' I snapped, annoyed. 'Why aren't detectives coming to take evidence, why aren't-' 

'I know, I know,' the vicar said softly. 'Remember this is a small town. They're doing what they can for now. Forensics have already been, but we're such an isolated town. We just have to trust they're doing their best.' 

'But what about-' 

'Vincent?' The old vicar finished my sentence. 'I've insisted he go home and have some time off.' 

The vicar stepped closer to me. 'He doesn't have any family. His sister was all he had, I can't imagine what he's feeling. I'll be joining you on watch tonight while he's away. The police have searched the perimeter and secured any openings in the fence, nothing will get in or out without us knowing. ' 

....

Raised voices filled the evening atmosphere as I entered the cold iron gates of the churchyard. 

'You should be at home resting, you've no reason to be here tonight.' The vicar said sternly.

'She was my sister. I want to be here, I *need* to be here.' Vince replied sharply. 

'This isn't helping anyone, please go home.' The vicar told him. 

I walked up to them and cleared my throat. 

'Ah, thank goodness you're here,' the vicar gestured to me. 'Vincent just arrived and I've told him he should be home resting. Could you-' 

'No, I gotta be here to catch this prick.' Vince looked at me, his voice slightly breaking. 'She was my fuckin' sister, man.' 

A wave of sympathy washed over me as I remembered what the vicar had told me last night. 

'I mean, we could use all the help we can get,' I suggested. 'Three people is better than two.' 

Vince turned to look at the vicar, his blue eyes filled with desperation and pleading. 

The vicar sighed. 

'I'm not trying to be malicious, I'm just thinking about what's best for you. If you really want to stay, I can't force you to go. But I really think it's best if you were at home recovering emotionally.' 

Vince nodded. 'I'd like to stay.' 

....

  
'What do you think you're doing, stop that at once!' 

I shone my flashlight in the direction of the vicar's voice in the distance and began running towards him. 

The vicar stood on the grass with his phone to his ear. In front of him, a short man dressed in all black stood over a grave which had been partially dug into. The man stood with his hands raised in the air and a shovel at his feet. His facial details were impossible to make out due to the black ski mask over his head. 

'Please-' The man pleaded in an accent I couldn't place. 

'Now you just wait there, the police are on their way.' The vicar told him sternly. 

I felt a rush of wind as Vince lunged past me and tackled the man. 

'Stop it, now stop it!' The old vicar yelled as Vince began throwing punches. 

The vicar grabbed Vince by the shoulders and attempted to pry him from the man, who had curled himself into a ball to protect himself from the blows. 

I grabbed Vince's other shoulder and we managed to pull him off his prey. 

During the scuffle, Vince had unmasked the grave robber. He looked to be in his 40's, with short dark hair and brown eyes. He was sweating heavily'  

'Please,' the man begged. 

'What's your name?' The vicar wanted to know. 

'Andres,' the man responded nervously. 'Andres Rivera.' 

'And what are you doing in my churchyard every night digging up the deceased?' The vicar demanded.

'Please,' Andres repeated. 'It will kill me.' 

'What are you talking about?' 

Andres took a breath, still sitting on the floor with his legs to his chest. 

'It followed me over here... I fled from the Philippines. It followed.'

'Who followed you?' The vicar asked, looking confused. 

'It smelled the death on me,' Andres continued. 'I have an illness, not long left.' 

Andres noticeably shuddered, clutching his legs closer to his chest like a scared toddler. 

'I ran away, but it came after me. It found me. I feed it to keep it away. Please, it will kill me.' 

'I don't understand,' the vicar spoke up. 'What's come after you?' 

Andres looked up at him, his eyes wide. 

'Bal-Bal.' 

'I beg your pardon?' The vicar asked, leaning closer to the terrified Andres. 

'Bal-Bal,' Andres repeated, a tremble in his voice. 'In my home town in the Philippines, we were told stories as children about the creature that steals corpses and stalks the dying. I thought it was just stories, but then I got ill. I heard it every night on my roof. I smelled its putrid rotten odour. I saw its evil face at my window waiting for me to die so it can-' 

Andres was abruptly cut off by Vince. 

'This is bullshit,' Vince snapped. 'Why are we listening to this weirdo's bollocks story. He's obviously fuckin' insane and eating corpses.' 

'No, no,' Andres shook his head violently. 'I wouldn't... I only took what was necessary.' 

'Yeah, you took my fuckin' sister,' Vince spat, a malicious look in his eyes. 'There's a lotta empty graves here I could fill...'

'No, please. I'm sorry, I- I didn't know, I- please don't. I'm sorry.' 

I held my arm up to block Vince, who looked like he wanted to resume his attack on the snivelling Andres. 

'You don't understand what it's like!' Andres yelled with a broken voice. 'I have my final months in fear of this creature. I will not know peace.' 

'Now, calm down.' The vicar instructed. 'The police are pulling up now. Vincent, go and unlock the gate.' 

'Police, no. No!' Andres shouted desperately. 'I need to feed it, I can't-'

'That's enough now please,' The vicar said assertively. 'You're clearly unwell. I hope you get the care you need.' 

The three of us stood back and watched Andres be led away in handcuffs, his cries and pleas falling on deaf ears. 

....

I woke up feeling a sense of accomplishment. There was a spring in my step as I flicked my bread into the toaster and poured a cup of coffee.

I practically skipped to work that day, relieved that this shift will be as uneventful and mind numbingly boring as it was before. 

Vince volunteered to work with me tonight, ignoring the vicar's advice to take some time away. 

The hours practically flew by as we trudged up and down the gravelly paths. 

And then, I smelt it. A putrid smell, as if I'd walked into a tomb of a hundred rotting bodies. 

'What the fuck?' I choked, covering my nose. 

Vince shone his flashlight around. 'What's that smell, I'm gonna puke!' He spat, clasping his hand over his mouth. 

A shadow briefly covered the moon. 

'What was that?' I asked, looking up into the crisp night sky for anything out of the ordinary. 

'Up there.' Vince pointed to a dark figure balanced on the tiles of the steeple. 

'What the fuck, who's that?' I whispered. 

'It's fucking Andres,' Vince snapped. 'I'm gonna kill him!' 

'I don't think Andres could get up there,' I said, the nervousness I'd been pushing down escaping into my voice. 'I don't think anyone could get up there.' 

Vince's face turned from fury to fear as he realised what I was saying. 

Before either of us could say another word, the figure quickly scaled down the steeple roof with a natural ease no human could manage. As it reached the roof of the church building, it extended its long arms and glided out of sight. 

I looked at Vince. His face was pale, and his wide eyes remained locked on where the creature had gone. 

'We need to leave.' I whispered, terrified. 

'Our only way out is past where that thing went.' Vince replied, his voice haunting and hollow. 

I cursed when I remembered the opening in the fence that Andres had used, which had now been sealed off. 

'I say we run for it,' Vince whispered. 'Don't look back, just run to the gate.' 

'What, no way!' I hissed. 

'Then what? You wanna wait in here with this fuckin' thing?' Vince hissed back. 

'Call the police,' I told Vince. 'They'll help us.' 

Vince went quiet for a moment, before confessing. 'I never take my phone to work. No point, who am I gonna message? Only person I had that meant anything's gone. I got you, but I'd feel like a twat messaging you on your nights off.' 

I frantically dug my phone from my pocket, my hand shaking so hard I could barely type in my passcode. 

The loud sound of a branch breaking behind us propelled us into fight or flight, Vince grabbing my sleeve and pulling me, causing me to drop my phone as we fled.

We ducked behind a large headstone in the middle of the yard, gasping for breath. 

'Vince, I dropped the phone.' I whispered, frantic. 

'Ahh, *fuck*. It's ok.' Vince tried to calm me, although I could hear the masked desperation in his voice. 

'Can you see it?' I asked him, too scared to move from the false safety of our limestone cover. 

'I'll check.' Vince slowly and silently rose onto his knees, building up the courage to peer around the grave. 

I felt my stomach tighten suddenly. I tried to force myself to take a deep breath, but it felt as though my abdomen were in a vice. I reached down to clasp the pressure in my side, when my hand met something wet, cold and unfamiliar. I looked down. 

Gripping my thick winter coat was a grey, slimy bony clawed hand. 

'*Vince!'* I screamed, frantically squirming out of the creatures clutch. 

Vince looked over at me, before looking back and becoming face to face with the putrid creature. It then stood upright and towered over us as we began desperately crawling backwards. 

It was tall, with dark crimson eyes, yellow rotten teeth and a disgustingly long tongue which seemed to lap hungrily at its chest. Its skin was a horrible greenish grey, and it's arms were connected to its entire torso by a tight flap of skin, similar to a bat. Its limbs looked almost human, with five long, sickly fingers all accompanied by filthy, bloodied claws. 

And the smell. The creature smelled like the pinnacle of decomposition. It's hot breath filling our lungs with the unescapable stench of death. 

Vince grabbed my arm, pulling me up. '*Come on!'*

He pulled me along as we weaved in between headstones. Tears clouded my vision and my trousers felt cold and heavy where I had unknowingly lost control of my bladder.

Vince suddenly tripped, sending us both hurtling forwards mid sprint. I fell hard onto the gravelly floor, feeling a burning pain in my hand which had been scraped under my body weight. 

'Vince,' I whispered, groggily pulling myself up and turning to look at him. 'We have to ke-' 

My heart dropped when I saw Vince, lying motionless on the grass next to a hollow grave, a large wound across his head. 

I looked at the bloodied headstone beside him. 

**Mila Blossom Evans, forever 19**

**Beloved sister and friend. A short life lived to the fullest.** 

'Vince?' My voice quaked as I crouched over him and shook his lifeless body. 'Vince? *Vince, please!'* I begged him. 

But Vince never got up. The empty look in his glassy blue eyes telling me his soul had left. 

I wiped my tear soaked cheek with my sleeve and began hurriedly backing away as the creature slowly began to crawl along the gravel path towards Vance's body. 

'No...' I mustered as it cocooned his carcass with its fleshy wings '*No!'* 

The creature plunged its salivating tongue into Vince's eye socket, not even looking at me. I froze, sheer terror forbidding me from vomiting with disgust. The creatures sharp claws tore the clothes from Vince's body effortlessly as it began to rip away at his flesh.

##‚Äå Must-Have ‚Å¢Features in an Electric Kettle

Before diving into specific ‚Å£models, it's essential to understand the key features ‚Äåthat distinguish ‚Äåa good electric kettle from a great one.‚Äå Here's a breakdown of the most important ‚Äçconsiderations:

*   **Material:** stainless steel is‚Å£ a popular ‚Äãchoice for its durability, ‚Å¢rust resistance, and ‚Äãclean taste. Glass kettles allow ‚Äçyou‚Äç to‚Äå see the water boiling ‚Äåand‚Å§ offer ‚Å¢a ‚Å£unique aesthetic,but ‚Å§they can ‚Äåbe more fragile.Plastic kettles are generally less expensive‚Å§ but may impart a slight ‚Å¢plastic taste to the water.
* ‚Å§ ‚Å¢ **Capacity:** Consider how much water you ‚Äãtypically need to boil at‚Äã once. Smaller kettles (around 1 liter) are ideal ‚Å§for‚Å£ individual use, while larger ‚Äãkettles (around 1.7 liters)‚Äã are better suited for families or entertaining guests.
*   ‚Äç**Heating Speed:**‚Å¢ Nobody wants to wait forever for water to boil. Look for kettles with powerful heating elements that can quickly bring water to a boil.
*‚Å§   **Temperature control:** ‚Å£Variable temperature control is ‚Äãa‚Å£ must-have for‚Å¢ serious tea and‚Å¢ coffee drinkers. Different types of tea require different brewing temperatures, and ‚Å£having precise control ensures optimal‚Äç flavor extraction.*  ‚Äã **Safety Features:** Automatic shut-off,‚Å§ boil-dry protection, and cool-touch exteriors are essential safety features that prevent accidents and ensure peace‚Å£ of‚Äã mind.
*   **Ease of ‚Å§Use:** Consider the ergonomics of the handle, the ease of‚Å¢ filling and‚Å¢ pouring, and the clarity of the controls. A user-friendly kettle will make your‚Äå daily routine more ‚Å§enjoyable.
*  ‚Äå **spout‚Äç Design:**‚Å£ A good spout‚Å¢ design minimizes‚Äã drips‚Äç and spills, ensuring a clean and controlled ‚Å¢pour. ‚Å¢Gooseneck spouts are particularly popular for pour-over coffee brewing, as they provide precise control over ‚Å¢the ‚Å¢water flow.

## Top Sur‚Äå La Table Electric Kettle Options

While Sur La Table offers a range of‚Äå electric kettles, certain models consistently ‚Äãstand out for ‚Äåtheir performance, features, ‚Å§and customer‚Äç satisfaction. ‚ÄãHere's a‚Äç closer ‚Äçlook at some top contenders:

1jfawd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1jfawd4/26f_lets_get_to_know_each_other/,26F - Let‚Äôs get to know each other :),"Hiya!

I‚Äôm 26 and from the eastern US. Like everyone else here, I‚Äôm hoping to meet some new people! Ideally, I‚Äôd love to connect with someone who enjoys real conversations and wants to form a genuine connection. I crave that, and honestly, it‚Äôs been far too long since I‚Äôve had it!

I like to think that I‚Äôm a pretty easygoing and talkative person, especially when I click with someone. I have a naturally optimistic, glass half full outlook on life. Unless we‚Äôre talking about coffee, in which case my cup is always half empty and I absolutely need of a refill. Sarcasm is practically a second language for me lol. But at the end of the day, I‚Äôm just someone who loves getting to know and spend time with those around me. 

When it comes to hobbies and interests, I have a ton, and I‚Äôm always open to learning about something new! I certainly don‚Äôt think we need to have all of the same interests. I absolutely love urban exploring (I have some many pictures of places I‚Äôve visited) and road trips. If it involves discovering new places, you can count me in. I also have a huge fascination with genealogy and history in general. Historical architecture holds a special place in my heart. I love to learn, in every capacity. 

I‚Äôm also a big sports fan! Football and hockey are my favorites, but I can definitely appreciate a good game no matter the sport. I have been wanting to get into UFC more as well. It‚Äôs so fun to watch, but I know next to nothing about it currently. Maybe you can help me if it‚Äôs something you like? When I‚Äôm not out exploring or watching a game, I love being in the great outdoors (when the weather cooperates, of course). I like camping, hiking, kayaking, and basically anything else outside. Thank goodness that the weather is finally starting to look up!

I will admit that I‚Äôm a homebody most of the time. I love to curl up with a good book and just relax. However, I will admit I‚Äôve been slacking on the reading recently. Pleaseeee feel free to give me suggestions. If I‚Äôm not reading, I‚Äôm probably watching a movie/TV. Some of my favorites are Star Wars, Harry Potter, Interstellar, Psycho, Black Mirror, The Twilight Zone, Breaking Bad, OITNB, and Shameless. I also have a mild obsession with houseplants (and trying desperately to keep them alive lol). I love baking, but by no means am I an expert. I like some video games, but I haven‚Äôt played in a while as I have somewhat lost interest. Although, I‚Äôm always down to watch someone else play and get way too invested in their game hahaha

Anyways, I‚Äôve rambled for far too long. If anything I‚Äôve said resonates with you, please reach out! I‚Äôd absolutely love to talk and get to know you. If not, I hope you find what you‚Äôre looking for! Have a wondering day/night, whatever it is when you come across this :)",6,1742426402.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,4,0.88,False

Of *COURSE* they did! Just not the kind of ""relations"" HE wanted üëÄ üò¨ üôä

>There were people who were looking forward to meeting Chairman Ikeda.

Yuh huh. [PLEASE continue.](https://imgur.com/MuMf8ON)

>There are people who have never met or had any contact with the president [Ikeda], but who are secretly waiting for the time to meet him. There are also people who fervently wish, ""I really want to introduce this person to President Ikeda. I want them to meet.""

Yes! And WE get to know ALL ABOUT what they were ""secretly"" thinking and feeling, because SGI owns the world's only functioning Omniscient Narrator!! That's why no one ""on the outside"" is aware of all this yearning and longing for ""De Mentor"" - it's *ùï§ùïñùïîùï£ùïñùï•!* Shhh!

>**Buckingham at dusk**

>Buckingham Palace in London, England.

>Glancing from the top of the huge gateposts are sculptures of a lion and a unicorn, the symbols of England and Scotland respectively.

>The front gate, decorated with the same design, was opened by a guard.

>A dark blue Rolls Royce slowly disappears into the palace. Who is in it? Tourists stare from outside the fence.

""Who could this mysterious visitor be?? We can all tell that he's not just *rich*, but IMPORTANT and *POWERFUL*, too! AND he's going to be leaving under cover of darkness - oooOOoooo *mysterious!*""

>May 25th, 1989. In one of the rooms in the palace, evening approached and the light outside began to fade.

>The chandelier was dazzling. The incandescent lamps in the four corners of the room were also on, providing more than enough light for work.

The writing is terrible. The detail is superfluous and trite.

>Princess Royal - Anne, the eldest daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, was looking through a stack of documents at her desk.

>She has been in public service since she was 18 years old. She has held the titles of ""chairman"" and ""president"" of dozens of organizations. Being a ""figurehead"" in name only does not suit her, so she has chosen to lead busy lives.

>It's almost time for guests to arrive.

>The best-dressed woman in British society. She is wearing a blue dress with white polka dots. Her simple attire makes it clear that this is a private meeting.

The writing is terrible. The detail is superfluous and trite.

>""Here we go.""

WHO said this? Or thought it? Or was *secretly* thinking it?? Were thoughts from the tourists outside the fence bleeding in through the walls? ""Daddy, I want a donut!""

>When the butler told her, the princess tidied up her desk and quietly stood up.

>Meeting with Princess Anne

>President Ikeda stood at the door and expressed his gratitude for the visit.

>""I am well aware of your dedicated efforts for the benefit of humanity. As a Buddhist, I respect 'people of action.'""

""And I am prepared to suck up to you like there's no tomorrow.""

>I was led into the room. In the center was a mahogany table set. It was oval in shape and could seat ten people. It was designed for practical use.

The writing is terrible. The detail is superfluous and trite.

>I sat down at the marble mantelpiece , the room reflected in a gilded mirror, and there was a painting on the wall, a Van Dyck or a Rembrandt ?

The writing is terrible. The detail is superfluous and trite.

And wouldn't Scamsei, the ""art expert"", KNOW whether it was a Van Dyck or a Rembrandt??

>**Ann** is the president of the children's relief organization Save the Children . SGI has also supported refugee relief efforts for many years.

""But we can't be bothered to spell her name rite.""

>[Ikeda says:] ""The refugee problem is a humanitarian challenge that challenges humanity on how to live as human beings.""

>""Exactly.""

This is the essence of Ikeda's ""dialogues"" - stating truisms and deepities at each other and agreeing.

>Ann agrees. She has personally visited famine-hit Ethiopia , war-torn Vietnam and Cambodia to help with the reconstruction efforts. That is why she has a strong interest in education.

>""What kind of university is Soka University ?""

""Because of *COURSE* The Princess Royal would want to know all about MY pet projects!""

>He spoke about the school's founding philosophy, motto, and belief in enabling talented people to soar out into the world.

>Gradually the questions become less specific.

>""Interactions with international students""

>""What is the scholarship system?""

This is patently absurd. We're to believe that Anne, the Princess Royal, *INVITED* Shorty-Greasy FatFat *to come all the way from Japan* so that she could ask him superficial, banal questions that could easily have been answered in a phone call between their secretaries instead??? THIS is what she, the ""hardest-working royal,"" chose to allocate her scarce spare time to??

>He was not just a figurehead [of Soka University], but someone who had been involved in the business. The conversation went on and on, but the scheduled time had passed. The chairman got up.

 *

>#The details of the meeting have not been made public out of respect for the royal family. The British royal family does not like to have private meetings between members of the royal family reported. It was extremely unusual for the Seikyo Shimbun to report on the meeting at a later date.

And *extremely commonplace* for Ikeda ghostwriters to JUST PLAIN MAKE SHIT UP!!

>""please""

...she whispered breathlessly, her heartbeat audible in her ears, her face flushing winsomely...

>After the meeting, the Princess expressed her wish.

>**""I'd love to see you again.""**

...her voice caught in her throat, overwhelmed with the fierce passion he set ablaze within her, unbidden, unanticipated...breathless, she fluttered her luxuriant eyelashes fetchingly, her heart beating wildly at the thought that this might be the last time she ever set eyes upon his powerful manly physique...she was barely able to stop herself from running to him, throwing herself into his arms, giving herself up to the unstoppable unbridled desire that threatened to ruin her self-control and render her helpless in this moment, unafraid of what tomorrow might bring...

**No pics = it didn't happen.**

ON TO CHOLLS!!!!

>**At the Crown Prince's private residence**

>On June 8, 1994, Anne's brother, Prince Charles, was waiting for guests at his private home in Highgrove in southwest England .

>It's a private place. Only close friends are invited.

""*That's* why Ikeda gets in - he's so very *chummy* with the then-future King of England! ALL the royals want a piece of Dee-licious Dai-saku!""

>The Prince of Wales covers a large part of his living and working expenses through his own business. He sells organic food here and has used the proceeds for charity work.

>At the time, Charles was alone.

>Since separating from Crown Princess Diana in 1992 (divorcing in 1996), he had been the target of media bashing.

FYI, there are plenty of pictures from 1986 when Prince Cholls and Di visited Japan for a 6-day visit, but no picture of either of them with Ikeda. 

>The car carrying Chairman Ikeda passes through the rolling hills of the Cotswolds.

>A sheep grazing on grass raised its head. White clouds flowed slowly across the blue sky. The yellow of mustard flowers as far as the eye could see was dazzling. It was a scene that evoked nostalgia for the British.

The writing is terrible. The detail is superfluous and trite.

>There are a few honey-colored buildings scattered here and there, most likely made from locally mined limestone .

The writing is terrible. The detail is superfluous etc.

>The car passed through the gate leading to the private residence and slowly drove through the garden, which was meticulously tended .

The writing is terrible. The detail etc.

>A geometric hedge of  trimmed boxwood . Irises. Forget -me-nots . Tulips.

The writing is terrible etc.

>The car stopped in front of the mansion. It was three stories tall and looked like a compact version of Buckingham Palace.

üôÑ

>It was just after 10 a.m. as promised. The owner was waiting for me at the entrance on the first floor. He looked great in his double-breasted grey suit.

""Don't you look *great*, Your Highness? That's a *great* suit! You *must* tell me who your tailor is!""

And ""The owner""??

>Prince of Wales , full name Charles Philip Arthur George Mountbatten-Windsor 

Oh, *him* üßê

>[Cholls says:] ""I have heard a lot about you, President Ikeda. I was looking forward to meeting you.""

""I was *desperate* to be in your presence. You are as a god to me.""

>[Ikeda says:] ""It's an honor to be invited.""

>[Ikeda continues:] When I shook his hand, his hands were gnarled, probably from the constant farm work he did, and in contrast to his smart, gentlemanly appearance, they felt very masculine.

""I immediately detected a burning in my loins, rising...""

>He [Charles] called out to Hiromasa Ikeda (Vice Chairman) , who was accompanying him [Ikeda], ""We met before.""

>A few years ago, when he visited the graduation ceremony at United World College in the suburbs of Albuquerque, USA , he exchanged greetings with Hiromasa, who was attending on behalf of Chairman Ikeda.

Prince Charles visited United World College in Montezuma, New Mexico, which is 2 hours away from Albequerque but only 10 minutes away from Las Vegas, NM (ooh! There's a Thunderbird Motel! And a *prison!*). This visit was for the college's *dedication* in 1982, but not for any ""graduation"".

And there's no evidence Hiromasa Ikeda ever went anywhere NEAR there. Back then, Ikeda was doing his *own* traveling - and he NEVER took either of his surviving sons along on his little boondoggly trips. *NEVER.*

>""May I show you around the garden?""

This is painful.

>[Ikeda recounts:] The meeting time was limited, so I politely declined.

""I had an *example* to set for the Prince, who clearly was hungering to learn everything he could from me.""

>[Charles' turn:] I entered the living room. The sunlight coming in from the windows was amazing. The chairman [Ikeda], the interpreter, and Hiromasa Ikeda were sitting on the sofa.

""Somehow they scurried past me into the living room and had taken the best seats before I even got there.""

>""Would you like some coffee or tea?""

>The dog ‚Äã‚Äãis running around the room.

The writing is terrible. The detail is superfluous and trite.

>‚ñºAs a person and as a friend

>They had plenty to talk about: both received honorary doctorates from the University of Bologna in Italy.

Gosh, yeah - that's a *lot* right there üò∂

>The Crown Prince has also been involved in education, founding the Architecture Academy  in 1992 .

No, it was 19**8**2.

>""Why did you become interested in architecture?"" Chairman Ikeda asked. He [Cholls?] answered from the perspective of his own studies of architecture and civilization.

I thought it was *PRESIDENT* Ikeda.

>Soon, a crunching sound came from afar, and the dog ‚Äã‚Äãjerked his nose out the window.

>‚óÜThey formed a friendship through heartfelt words.

[WAT??](https://i.imgur.com/B9q0DA0.png)

>The royal red helicopter landed on the lawn outside, and I felt vibrations under my feet.

*HUH??* Helicopters don't ""crunch"". And ""vibrations??*

The writing is terrible. The detail is superfluous and trite.

>After the meeting, Charles was due to leave for Oxford, where US President Clinton was waiting.

I'm sure Icky was *dying* of jealousy, considering how far out of joint his nose was just the year before, in '93 when Clinton refused to give him a photo-op/an audience!

""Prince Charles, I'll have you know that I am prepared to travel with you to meet US President Clinton, right this very moment if you wish."" 

>The chairman was very concerned about time, taking into consideration the Crown Prince's schedule.

Yeah. One look at Shorty-Greasy FatFat, and your immediate impression is ""Now THERE's someone who's solicitous and considerate of others, who always focuses on others' welfare and comfort."" üôÑ

And notice how Cholls is apparently dragging his feet, unwilling for his special moment with Icky to end.

>So Charles spoke boldly, his words full of force.

>""I am fighting against irrationality, I am fighting against evil, against injustice.""

ü§Æ

*Bleahhhhhhh*

>The chairman [Ikeda] responded immediately.

""I spoke to the Prince as if I was describing him to someone who'd never met him.""

>""I know that the Crown Prince is courageously speaking out for his beliefs. He is taking action to reform society. But when he takes action, there will be opposition, there will be jealousy, and there will be plots to tarnish his reputation.""

Yes, students - when you're writing a retrospective of something that never happened, you can feel free to allow later events to inform your scenario as if your protagonist is prescient because nobody will ever notice or care.

>There is no stagnation whatsoever.

[*WAT?*](https://imgur.com/2fxeTfO)

>""No matter what happens, we must look down and move forward with determination. If leaders do not move forward with determination, the people will be unhappy. I believe that it is only by facing and overcoming the storm that we can create an enduring enterprise.""

I believe that was supposed to be Icky flapping his blubbery wet lips in Cholls' general direction.

>Those were heartfelt words.

The writing is terrible. The detail is superfluous and trite.

>Prince of Wales . This is not a beautiful expression that reflects his status or title.

""I longed to rip that great suit of his right off his regal shoulders and see how much of a dirty *common* man the Prince was at heart...I felt the blood roaring in my ears as a great wave of deep *feeling* threatened to engulf me and drive me to reckless actions I wouldn't ever be able to walk back...but in that moment, I was willing to risk it...for him...""

>The helicopter's propellers are roaring in the garden, and you can almost sense the pilot's impatience.

The writing is terrible. The detail is superfluous and trite.

And there's that omniscient narrator again. Trust me - in matters of state, NOBODY is worrying about how *the pilot is feeling about doing his job.*

>""President Ikeda, what I am trying to do faces many difficulties. I could not do it without courage and determination. I also need the support of others. Thank you for your kind words.""

""You mean more to me than I could ever put into words üò≠""

>Shortly after the group left the private residence, they heard a loud whirring noise overhead.

>I looked up and saw a red helicopter cutting through the blue sky at high speed.

""I wept because Cholls did not invite me to come along. So then Hiromasa and I went back inside and stole all the silverware.""

**No pics = it never happened.**

>‚ñºSudden speech

>This must have made quite an impression on him, as Charles told his friend, the Marquis of Reading:

>""I was very impressed. I never knew there was someone who could understand me so well, and I've never met anyone like that before.""

>""There are few people in the world with such a bold personality as Chairman Ikeda.""

*I'msosuuure*...

>I wanted to meet him again. The following year, in 1995, an exhibition was held at the architecture school that Ikeda had founded. I sent an invitation to Chairman Ikeda.

Weird fact: There is NO ""architecture school"" listed in the schools Ikeda founded - per [Ikeda's own website](https://archive.ph/SVS6m)

In 1982, Prince Charles established the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture Summer School (now the King's Foundation) which has architecture-based summer programs in various locations - for 1995, the session was held in Caprarola, Italy.

Ikeda wasn't even *IN* Italy in 1995 - he visited there in 199**4**.

>**The day of the exhibition.**

>While exchanging greetings with the guests, Charles's eyes fell on the face of one person. It was an SGI representative who had come as a representative.

In case you were wondering, #ThatHappened, too. WHY would an SGI representative have been invited *there??*

And now the unnamed ""SGI representative"" is apparently speaking:

>He [Charles] beckoned me forward and, without any warning, called out in a loud voice.

>""Everyone, please listen.""

üôÑ

>The participants murmured and listened intently.

""Somehow I find myself utterly preoccupied with the enigmatic President Ikeda...I dream about him at night...I find my thoughts drawn unbidden to the last time I gazed upon his sweaty fat face...I lose myself in those large pores...I can't stop thinking about him!""

As you may have imagined, there is no record outside of those lying Soka Gakkai liarpantses that ANY of this ever happened IRL.

**No pics = it never happened.**

Back to the reality that the Soka Gakkai was *desperately* trying to get Ikeda into the royals' attention somehow.

*Soka Gakkai* made sure to make with the condolence messages *in Ikeda's name* from THEIR end:

- [to Queen Elizabeth](https://archive.ph/wreON) on the occasion of her husband Prince Phillip's death
- [to King Charles](https://archive.ph/LWGbz) on the occasion of his mother Queen Elizabeth's death

And the Soka Gakkai made sure to send a congratulatory message *in Ikeda's name* to Cholls upon the occasion of his coronation:

>[SGI President Sends a Congratulatory Message to His Royal Highness King Charles III on His Coronation](https://archive.ph/fRmYe) (May 2023)

There were apparently no official acknowledgments of any of these ""messages"".

Ikeda's site states that:

>President Ikeda visited Buckingham Palace in May 1989 and met with HRH Princess Anne. In June 1994, he also met with HRH Prince Charles in Gloucester in southwest England. [2021](https://archive.ph/wreON#selection-4787.0-4787.171)

That verbiage was updated the next year:

>The SGI President made a courtesy visit to Buckingham Palace in May 1989, where he met with Princess Anne. He also met with King Charles III, then Prince of Wales, in Gloucestershire, southwest England, in June 1994. [2022](https://archive.ph/LWGbz#selection-4787.0-4787.216)

Gee, what's a ""**courtesy visit**"" and how is it *different* from just a plain ol' *regular* visit? Embellishing is the habit of LIARS.

For all their supposed *great* affection AND ADMIRATION for Shorty-Greasy FatFat, those lazy royals couldn't bothered to have their secretaries draft even a *short* message of condolence!

Here's what they sent when former US President Jimmy Carter passed:

>[King Charles Expresses ‚ÄòGreat Sadness‚Äô Over the Death of U.S. President Jimmy Carter: ‚ÄòAn Inspiration to Many‚Äô](https://people.com/king-charles-expresses-great-sadness-over-the-death-of-us-president-jimmy-carter-inspiration-to-many-8767428)

>The King expressed ‚Äúgreat fondness‚Äù of meeting Carter during his visit to the U.K. in 1977, early in his presidency

>‚ÄúIt was with great sadness that I learned of the death of President Carter,‚Äù King Charles wrote Dec. 29. ‚ÄúHe was a committed public servant, and devoted his life to promoting peace and human rights. His dedication and humility served as an inspiration to many, and I remember with great fondness his visit to the United Kingdom in 1977.‚Äù

But *nothing at all* for Ikeda.

Been stalking this place for a bit but be good to have anyone chirp in with a similar experience or recommendations.
Got IPL for stubborn sunspots last year and they did the coffee grain effect and fell off and were a bit lighter.
HOWEVER in the centre of my forehead I got super blotchy skin after being in the sun. Granted my own fault for wearing low spf.
I‚Äôm now super religious with creams, serums and spf with zinc.
But I still notice it even in winter :( it‚Äôs all in the centre then there‚Äôs two white circle kind of shapes above my eyebrows where I can tell it was the IPL doing those sunspots.
Almost makes me annoyed as sunspots if take over melasma.
I was (still am) a sun worshiper so it is likely my fault I got dark spots in first place.
But a year on and I still see the melasma or hyperpigmentation?? Not sure which it is from the IPL. Photo was about two weeks after my third IPL.

Anyone got recommendations and any good news this may go?
I‚Äôll always wear spf now but it might be nice to do 20/30 when I want a bit of a tan. It‚Äôs so annoying as I used to pride myself on even skin!!

1jfalfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jfalfj/i_thought_i_was_dating_one_guy_then_his_other/,I thought I was dating one guy. Then his ‚Äòother self‚Äô got involved‚Ä¶ and the 100+ missed calls started. The trauma still affects me to this day,"This happened four years ago, but I‚Äôve never really told the full story. Even now, it still makes me nauseous when I think about it.


I met this guy through a dating app. We talked regularly on the app before moving to texting. At first, it was really nice. He was sweet, interesting, and we vibed a lot.


We eventually went to out first date at a coffee shop near our campus (we went to the same uni). Looking back, how that date went should've been the üö© that made me reconsider seeing him again :')


First, he wouldn‚Äôt stop talking about himself and kept cutting me off, which was annoying, but I tried to ignore it. Then, he kept bringing up his ex‚Äînot once, not twice, but multiple times. He started the topic, and I was stupid for listening.  


But the worst part came after the date. I decided to give him a chance, so we kept texting and had a few calls. But on one call, he went on a loooooong rant about his ex‚Äîhow they met, why they broke up, and how she was the best person he‚Äôd ever known. He even sounded like he was still in love with her. Like‚Ä¶ why are you talking to me if you‚Äôre still that hung up on your ex? And why would you tell the whole story to someone you‚Äôre supposedly trying to date??????? Idk why I didn‚Äôt just hang up. Probably because of my people-pleasing tendencies. I thought it‚Äôd be rude to say anything. I was stupid, I know.


At some point, he opened up about his mental health struggles. I was struggling too with anxiety, so I was understanding. He told me he had ""two people inside him."" I asked if he had DID, but he was undiagnosed and didn‚Äôt confirm. I tried to be supportive, even though I didn‚Äôt fully understand. Then he gave me a separate phone number for his ""other self."" I was skeptical but didn‚Äôt want to be dismissive.


But then‚Ä¶ he started switching between his two selves on command, within a few minutes. Five minutes max. And as far as I know, that‚Äôs not how DID works. I tried to research it, but nothing matched what he was doing. His ""other self"" would message me, saying his ""main self"" was miserable, that he needed me to protect him, that they needed me to be there for them no matter what happen. I had big doubts, but I felt guilty for not believing him. So I went along with it.
 

The more we talked, the clearer it became that this wouldn‚Äôt work. Not only was he still obsessed with his ex, but he also admitted he wasn‚Äôt ready to date me and that it could take ""months"" before he would be. So he just wanted to keep me around without making things official something a goal in the near future at all since the start apparently. I know what he wants is different from wanting to take things slow. But I assume when we talk, went of the date, etc. we were actually going to date eventually if we found that we like each other. But I know it doesn't matter anymore after his rant about his ex. (Even I want to wack my past self for tolerating him that long. Believe me, I'm the one that's most pissed about my own stupidity).


So I decided to end things. Before making it final, I told him I needed a few days to think. I wanted to end things on a good note so badly, tbhhh. But the moment I sent that message, he completely changed.


He started calling me. First through the messaging app. I wasn‚Äôt ready to talk. I told him I needed time alone. He ignored that and called again. I texted that I didn‚Äôt feel like talking. He called again. So I muted him. Then he started calling from his ""other self‚Äôs"" number. Muted that too.


When I didn‚Äôt pick up, he started calling my actual number. I kept declining, but he would not stop. I muted my phone notifications, but he kept calling‚Äîover 100 times. My phone was unusable because of the nonstop incoming calls. I was terrified. I turned it off.


But he didn‚Äôt stop. He messaged me on Instagram. All three of my accounts. My main, my throwaway‚Äîschool project account (which had my name on it, so I guess he found it by looking up my name), and worst of all, my private acc. I didn‚Äôt use my name on that one and only my closest friends followed it (literally like 10 people). I have no idea how he found it. Seeing his messages there scared the hell out of me.


I have really bad anxiety, so that day completely shook me. I blocked all his numbers and social media accounts (at least the ones I knew). Since we went to the same uni, I spent the next month constantly on edge, feeling watched, afraid he‚Äôd confront me or demand I talk to him. I couldn‚Äôt walk around campus in peace. Thankfully, he never showed up at my building or tried to find me in person. We never even ran into each other, which I‚Äôm so grateful for.


But because of him, I haven‚Äôt dated since. I'm scared of opening up. I can't give my numbers to people I don't trust. I panic every time an unknown number calls me. Even now. It really messed me up. I know it‚Äôs been years, but I still wanted to get this off my chest since I‚Äôve never told anyone the full story.",1,1742425584.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.67,False

I'm trying to figure out if I'm totally delusional or if this guy is *subtly* flirting. I'm an idiot. Obviously. But I've only experienced guys being super direct.  

There's this coffee place next to where I work that I frequent quite a bit. I'll often hit the drive through on my way into the office or when leaving for an appointment. At lunch I'll often walk over with some colleagues and go inside to get some air. 

Maybe two months or so ago we walked over at lunch and the guy who made my coffee looked a little nervous when he went to hand it to me and commented ""don't you usually come through drive through."" My colleagues joked that I'm there so often and I joked that I drink my weight in coffee and he laughed. That was it. 

About 3 weeks ago I was going through drive through and he took my order, but the way it's set up the person who takes the order doesn't pass it out the window. It looked like he shoo'd the girl at the window away to bring me my iced coffee and gave me a free shot of caramel in it, which I thanked him for. 

Another time since then over lunch I went with my colleagues. He was working the front counter and looked nervous when we walked in. He called the other girl working over and said something to her and I heard her giggle and say ""ok, but which one"" while glancing at us. She then took our orders and he went to the back.

The last couple times I've gone through drive through and he's passed me my drink he hasn't said anything, but I swear he's intentionally touching my hand as he passes it. 


I can't tell if he's just being nice, or if there's something more and he's subtle because he's working. I want to just ask him out and be done with it, but I don't want to loose my coffee place if I'm crazy and it gets awkward. I really do live off caffeine.

1jfadxh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jfadxh,First Rack,"Saw this rack for ¬£40 on FB marketplace and decided to bite the bullet and organise the sprawl of hardware that I had sat on an old coffee table. Most of this stuff I bought over the past 8 months on FB marketplace, ebay, aliexpress or with Cex vouchers anytime I found a bargain. Only real struggle I've had using second hand components has been the lack of bolts.

From top to bottom:

* D-Link DMS108, 8 port 2.5Gb switch
* OPNSense router with WireGuard running on an Optiplex 3060 micro
* APC Back-UPS Pro 900
* Sparsely populated keystone patch panel (slightly envious of all the posts I see on here with 24 or 48 patch cables)
* Monitor for debugging & setup, will likely move it to my desk since kinks are ironed out, or use it as some sort of dashboard.
* ""Laptop Shelf"" for work and uni laptops with an HP Thunderbolt Dock 120W G2 for peripherals, power & networking
* TrueNAS Scale storage server with 5TB of mirrored storage, Ryzen 4650G PRO, 16GB ECC DDR4, 2.5Gb NIC
* Ubuntu dev server with Ryzen 7700, 32GB DDR5

The storage and dev servers are mounted on rails in 4U 4088-S cases from IPC which have 1 120mm intake fan mount that comes with a pre-installed constant RPM fan. It was kinda noisy for a living room setup and I wanted to improve the cooling regardless, so I was able to 3D print a 1[20mm fan bracket for 5.25 inch bays](https://www.printables.com/model/68734-120mm-fan-bracket-for-pc-525-inch-bays/related)¬†and laser cut a custom front screen with holes for airflow. I've now got 2 Arctic P12 Continous Operation fans in each server with gentle fan curves and the difference is night and day. I've repurposed the old fans into a soldering extraction unit.

To use the Optiplex as a router with an unmanaged switched I got an[¬†M.2 A+E to 2.5Gb NIC adapter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CXSXPHYH?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)¬†and put in in the WLAN connector with the RJ45 port screwed to the case where the optional VGA module is meant to go. It's worked flawlessly since I installed the drivers in OPNSense and the port fits the VGA module slot as if by design.

Overall I'm pretty happy with everything, performance is more than adequate for my use cases, idle power draw is around 25 watts & in total the entire setup cost me around ¬£1400. Only thing I'm thinking of adding is a KVM for the dev server as I've found WOL a bit iffy (probably a skill issue). I know its a bit of a clich√© in this sub to say you are ""done"", but in terms of functionality this is enough for everything I do in my day to day. I've really enjoyed setting all this up, but I'd rather be featuring this rack in a post on¬†[r/malelivingspace](https://www.reddit.com/r/malelivingspace/)¬†than posting a home data center next to this rack in my parents living room.

1jfaau5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1jfaau5/report_on_my_recent_trip_on_the_celebrity/,Report on my recent trip on the Celebrity Silhouette,"So, about two weeks ago I was one a four day cruise on the Celebrity Silhouette departing from Port Everglades Cruise Terminal in Fort Lauderdale. I thought I share my experiences and hear what you think.

**Terminal -**

The Good - Arrived at Port Everglades pretty quickly from our hotel, got through security with ease. Celebrity personnel were there to check us in, checking our driver's licenses and passports which took less then 5 minutes for all of us.

The Bad - When you arrive at the terminal, in this case Celebrity leaves out of Terminal 25 that's when the nightmare begins, you have other passengers, taxis, Uber and Lyft trying to navigate at the same time to drop off passengers, because my dad is disabled so my mom dropped us and our luggage at the terminal and she went to park the car which took almost 35 minutes because of having to navigate back from the parking garage to the terminal.

**Cabin -**

The Good - Nice size Concierge room, comfortable for three people. Balcony was large and afforded privacy from neighbors. The bathroom was large and we were able to store our essentials such as toothbrushes, deodorants, shaving kits etc...

At night I frequently sat on our balcony with comfortable seats looking at the water, feeling the breeze and watching the other cruise and freight ships in the distance.

The Bad - My bed was a couch which was not even a pull out just a mattress underneath couch pillows which kept slipping off the couch. As stated in The Good, the bathroom was a nice size BUT the shower itself was quite claustrophobic, I felt like if the shower doors some how stuck I'd feel like I was trapped. The display light on the telephone never shuts off so in the middle of the night unless your a heavy sleeper you'll have to deal with that light and unlike other cruise lines and even hotels, Celebrity does not even reset a cabin's voice mail, when I checked my voice messages there were like nearly 100 messages from previous cruises, not good, make sure you delete your voicemails before disembarking.

**Dining -**

The Good - Ok, on embarkment day on the Silhouette because we were Concierge guests we got an exclusive lunch in the main dining room, I had the butternut soup, Moroccan braised short ribs and a slice of apple pie, on the days following we ate in the main dining room, the food was excellent and our table was across from a port window so we could see the water and waves crashing as we ate.

The Bad - Only complaint here is the Mast Grill just above the pool, the burgers and hot dogs were overcooked although they did offer a good number of sides and condiments and the ice cream was not really at all edible, it was like someone at Celebrity was just like ""F\*\*k it, let's buy and serve the cheapest, crappiest tasting ice cream, the passengers wouldn't notice the difference."" Wrong!!! we did notice.

**Internet Access -**

The Good - After going through the login process I found that the speeds were sufficient enough that I could stream YouTube and some services like Pluto TV and Tubi.

The Bad - In addition to only one person at a time access, I was unable to protect my privacy, after multiple assurances by users on Reddit, Facebook and other social media sites that a VPN (In my case NordVPN) would work on Celebrity I found that after connecting to Celebrity's network I tried logging into my VPN multiple times with **no success**, I went down to the iLounge and the one person there told me that VPNs are dangerous and that's why they are not allowed, after hearing this I went into my diatribe that is the dumbest statement that I ever heard a person say (Actually it isn't but...) and I asked them if they knew what a VPN was they replied no, so I told that I've been working with computers for 45 years and to just shut the hell up and not talk about or make false statements about things they know nothing about.

**Pool -**

The Good - I spending most of my time in the Solarium which has its own pools and spa, it was quite and I was able to relax.

The Bad - Ended up unknowingly booked my cruise during spring break and the main pool was wall to wall college students, drinking and taking up all the pool and spa space.

**Casino -**

The Good - The dealers are friendly and they get to know you personally by name, in the beginning of the evenings when the ship stops in port it usually opens by 5pm on sail days by 10:00am. Tables minimums start at $5 up to $100 but when you hit the mid point of the night they can go from $10-15 to $100 per bet.

The Bad - In the beginning of the cruise the waiters and waitresses fell over backwards for your order but at some point by day 2 and 3 you give them your order and they disappear and you never see them again.

**Bars -**

The Good - None

The Bad - Unless you have the inclusive booze plan **do not buy** liquor because they will rip you off with exorbitant prices per shot, plus if you want a premium liquor such as Royal Crown, Buffalo Trace, Four Roses etc... they charge an uptick fee for these liquor, Buffalo Trace was $10 extra so that would have been $22 for one shot. so even if you have the booze plan they find ways to screw you.

**Coffee -**

The Good - Took me a while to find the coffee bar but I'm glad I did, their coffees were premium and tasted incredible.

The bad - If you order a coffee to drink it in the coffee bar they give it took in a large coffee mug with a biscuit on the side, but if you order to go, its the same size cup in paper but you don't get a biscuit.

**Side Trips -**

The Good - Enjoyed going to Key West (Florida).

The Bad - Downside of Key West was the bus situation, things around Key West are so far apart from each other with the exception of certain parts of Duval and Front Streets which were relatively close that you could walk to, the tour bus companies want upwards of $45 to $100 a person for a hop on/hop off service and the City of Key West's public bus system which is free is far and few when you try to find one.

Unfortunately, our trip to Bimini in The Bahamas was cancelled because and according to the ship's Captain was due to rough waters and winds but I found out later that day that a SpaceX rocket had exploded off the coast of Florida and debris was raining down on South Florida and The Bahamas so we just spend another boring day at sea, on the upside they did immediately refund the cost of the trip which was over $60.

**Duty Free Shop -**

The Good - Good selection of alcohol and other knick-knacks with reasonable prices.

The Bad - Make sure you pick the correct item you want, I made the mistake of picking up Bulleit Bourbon instead of Buffalo Trace, I went back and the girl who barely spoke English played around on the register and said that I would receive a refund, when I checked my account on the Celebrity app I saw no refund, I waited 5 minutes checked again and nothing so I asked to speak to a manager and finally when one showed up, he went to the register did some things and unlike the other employee he handed me a receipt to sign for the refund, he took one copy and I took the other and within a minute the refund showed up on my ship account, I am not accusing but I suspect that these employees pretend to do a refund and by the time the customer realizes what happened they are charged for both bottles one of which was given back to the Duty Free shop and instead of going back in stock the employee walks away with free booze.",2,1742424806.0,Cruise,5,0.6,False

I awoke at 1 am and felt like I was baking alive. I went to the thermostat and checked it and to my horror it said 120 degrees. I was baking alive. I tried switching the thermostat off but it kept running. Then I heard it, a deep loud maniacal laugh emitting from the basement. I opened the basement door and switched the light on and slowly crept down the stairs determined to get to the bottom of this. When I rounded the corner and saw the furnace my blood ran cold. It was smiling evilly and when I saw it or should I say saw me it let out an evil laugh. The grille stretching and flexing like the mouth of a robot let out another deep long maniacal laugh. An orange glow that looked like lava emitting from behind the inky blackness of the grille. It was like I had let Satan himself in my basement. I tried switching off the power disconnect on the side of the furnace but when I did a searing pain shot through my hand. I screamed and looked down to see the flesh had been burned off my hand. It let out another laugh. I went to the breaker panel and when I opened the panel I heard a loud deep demonic voice scream ‚ÄúNO‚Äù I went to switch off the breaker but when I touched it I was thrown backwards. I had been electrocuted. I lay on the floor in shock as it let out another laugh. Sweat dripped down on me as the temperature continued to rise in the house. I needed to get out of there. I began stumbling back up the stairs and as I did I heard a loud demonic scream behind me and the house began to shake. I didn't look back. The house was shaking so bad I almost lost my balance while stumbling to the front door. I threw open the front door and as I ran out into the front yard,the cold air a relief I heard a loud demonic scream behind me. I reached the street and turned around just in time to see the house explode . Wood, Metal,glass, furniture flying everywhere. I ducked behind a parked car in the street for cover. Then it was quiet


   Barbara wasn't happy when she returned to find the house gone, the authorities said it was a gas leak that caused the explosion. There was very little left of the house when the cleanup was finished. We sold the land,took the insurance money and moved. Our new house thankfully has a normal HVAC system that's Not alive. I never told Barbara what really happened,or anyone,just that I smelled gas and got out. I tried to forget about the incident until this morning.

1jfaanx,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jfaanx/two_and_a_half_months_in_lost_a_lot_on_the_scale/,Two and a half months in - lost a lot on the scale. but not on the waist. Feeling a bit deflated.,"Hey Reddit!

So, to give context to the post. I am 25, male, 5 foot 5, and have always been overweight/obese. I am in a houseshare, so don't have much kitchen space, and I also hate cooking (context for later.) I also seem to have a very weak body, and always injure myself (my current injury is Plantair Flaciatis or however you spell it in the right heel which I've now had for four weeks, yay!)

Back in Nov, I was struggling to walk more than 3 minutes without back and ankle pain, so finally I started to do things about it.

From Nov to Jan 5th, I went from 20 stone 10 to 19 stone 12 (including a Christmas where I did the classic ""take a break"") and then from Jan 5th onwards, I started to take it seriously. I am now down 2 stone, to 17 12, but my waist size has barely moved (It went from 54 to 50 about half way in, and then it's just hovered between 51 - 50)

I am consistently in a calorie deficit, normally having between 1300 - 1600 calories, but sometimes as low as 1000. The food I am eating is certainly not the best, but there's reasons for why I eat what I do. I normally have a can of Monster (yes I know, but I hate coffee :( ) in the morning, then a meal deal consisting of a deli meat sub/similar (370 - 450 cal), Popchips (100 cal), and a small bottle of Orange Juice (120 cal.) I'll drink a mix of squash (cordial juice(?) ) and zero sugar fizzy throughout the day. I'll then have a couple of slices of cooked ham (55 cal) for a bit of protein (as I know I am nowhere near the 0.7g/kg of weight ratio) and some ready meal which is between 300 - 550 cals (see note above about kitchen space and hating cooking.)

I walk every day, normally around a mile in about 20-25 minutes, with a mix of uphill, downhill, and flat ground. On weekends, I will often do 1 1/2 miles, or more (weekend just gone I did 3 miles on Sat, 2 on Sun.)

I then do a home workout routine Mon, Wed, and Fri. I am terrible with names of the exercises, so here goes.

\- Lying Knee tuck(?). Lay down flat, bring one leg towards stomach/chest, then back again to flat. 10 reps on each leg.

\- 45s of I think a V sit, but I am likely doing it wrong (I raise my neck, hold my arms up, and lift my legs to be as close to straight in the air as I can.)

\- Another 10 reps on each leg of the knee tuck, but on my side rather than flat.

\- 45s of Elbow plank (wrists hurt too much to even do a couple of pushups, so I went with this)

\- 15 Squats

\- 3 sets of 5 bicep curls on each arm with a very makeshift weight (weighted blanket in a rucksack) - 15s break between them

\- Lift the bag with both arms, outstretch arm, hold for 30s

\- (Before the heel injury, I'd also do 10 ankle raises between each set of bicep curls)

I'm happy that I am losing the weight on the scale, but my stomach is where most of it is. I've always had a pudge, always been ashamed of it. My belt size has gone down from 3XL to hovering between XL and 2XL, but my shirts have remained 2XL (although I was pushing 3XL before, but I am now firmly 2XL. XL shirts and some 2XL shirts will fit, until I raise my arms where they get caught on the pudge and now my stomach is exposed.)

I don't really know what I want to get out of this post. I guess motivation? Some indication on when I may see results? I know you can't spot train, don't worry about that hah.

Thanks for reading my ramble.

TLDR - Was 19 stone 12, now 17 stone 12 two and a half months later, but my waist isn't moving and it's making me sad.",2,1742424794.0,loseit,4,0.67,False

I went to the nurse, checked me up, and I lied down for a bit. Was still feeling very weak, and then I asked the nurse to allow me to call my parent and take me home. I was still feeling weak, and by 3:00PM I felt very crummy. I had my mom let me take some honey because I was coughing only a little, and I took some Tylenol and drank a lot of water because i had a headache, and it WOULDNT STOP. The second day I was feeling a little bit better, but still that headache. This was where my stomach was feeling uneasy, so I had to use it. My stool was VERY drippy, pretty much water, and it wouldn‚Äôt stop leaking out. I asked my mom for why this was happening and she said it could‚Äôve been some sort of stomach flu. But the weird thing was that I ate some double noodle soup(the chicken noodle soup kind) and I felt extremely better. That was Because of me having a low electrolyte intake because I kept drinking coffee in the morning which lead to my body lacking in electrolyte. Today the consistency of my stool is still fluid but It‚Äôs more of a diarrhea consistency. Please tell me what this is, but for now I wish that symptom would end.",1,1742424778.0,teenagers,0,1.0,False
