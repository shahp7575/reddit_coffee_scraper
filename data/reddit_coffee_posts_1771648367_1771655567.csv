1rajyj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddmatch/comments/1rajyj2/28_m_bangalore_looking_for_a_partner/,28 M | Bangalore | Looking for a partner,"Originally from Pune, currently based in Bangalore and working as a data analyst in the oil & gas space. I’m a man of few words… but the right conversations can keep me up past my bedtime. Equal parts spreadsheets, curiosity, and random midnight Google searches about gadgets, food spots, and “how to cook this one thing perfectly.”

Life has thrown a few serious challenges my way (yes, I own more insurance policies than a typical 28-year-old 😄), but it has also made me value simple things — good food, peaceful company, inside jokes, and people who are real. I enjoy exploring underrated cafés, hunting for refurbished tech deals, cooking experiments that sometimes work, and occasionally just sitting with music and overthinking life.

Personality-wise, I’m calm on the outside, slightly chaotic on the inside. I like meaningful conversations, dark humor, and people who don’t pretend to have everything figured out. I’m introvert-friendly, comfortable with silence, and not someone who needs constant social noise to feel alive.

I’m looking for someone kind, self-aware, and emotionally honest. If you’re an introvert, have ADHD, are hot-headed, soft-spoken, or none of these — all good. Chemistry matters more than labels. I appreciate individuality, quirks, strong opinions, and people who can laugh at themselves.

No filters around caste, religion, or background — my family is multicultural and open-minded, and I value that a lot.

Looks aren’t everything, but I do have a soft spot for dusky and darker complexions — beauty comes in every shade, and confidence makes it shine brighter.

Age-wise, 22+ works, location doesn’t matter. Long conversations, shared playlists, random food plans, and building something genuine matter more than distance.

Bonus points if you:

• send reels at 2am

• get excited about food more than people

• have strong opinions about chai vs coffee

• can tolerate my occasional overthinking

• are okay with a partner who will absolutely research before buying a mixer grinder

If you’re someone who wants a peaceful, slightly nerdy, occasionally chaotic but sincere connection — we might get along.

Let’s start with a conversation and see where it goes ✨",1,1771655494.0,reddmatch,1,1.0,False

1rajy8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1rajy8d/how_to_be_the_most_charming_person_in_the_room/,# How to Be the Most Charming Person in the Room: The Psychology That Actually Works,"You walk into a party, a meeting, or literally anywhere with people. Some random dude in the corner is holding court like he's the main character. Everyone's laughing. People lean in when he talks. He's not the hottest person there. Not the richest. Not even the loudest. But everyone wants to be around him.

What the hell does he have that you don't?

I spent way too much time figuring this out. Read books like ""[The Charisma Myth](https://a.co/d/07lcoltE)"" by Olivia Fox Cabane (Stanford lecturer, worked with execs at Google and HP, this book is insanely good), watched hours of Charisma on Command breakdowns on YouTube, listened to podcasts interviewing everyone from magicians to CIA agents about influence. Turns out, charm isn't some magical gift you're born with. It's a learnable skill. And most people get it completely wrong.

Here's what actually works.

# Step 1: Stop Trying to Be Interesting

This is where most people fuck up. They think charm means being the most interesting person in the room. Wrong. Dead wrong.

Charm is about making OTHER people feel interesting. When you're genuinely curious about someone, when you actually listen instead of waiting for your turn to talk, something shifts. People remember how you made them feel, not what clever story you told.

**The trick:** Ask questions that make people light up. Not boring shit like ""what do you do?"" Ask stuff like ""what's been keeping you up at night lately?"" or ""what's something you're nerding out about right now?"" Then shut up and actually listen. Don't interrupt. Don't one-up their story. Just be present.

Robert Greene talks about this in ""[The Laws of Human Nature](https://a.co/d/01NA3cpT)"". He breaks down how the most magnetic people in history weren't the ones talking the most. They were the ones who made you feel like the only person in the room when they talked to you.

# Step 2: Master the Energy Triangle

This comes straight from Olivia Fox Cabane's research. Charisma isn't one thing. It's three things working together: **presence, power, and warmth**.

**Presence** means you're actually here, not mentally somewhere else checking your phone or thinking about what to say next.

**Power** is the feeling that you can make things happen, that you have value to offer. It's not about being an asshole. It's about confidence in your own worth.

**Warmth** is showing people you genuinely care about them, that you're not a threat.

Most people max out one and ignore the others. The ""alpha bro"" has power but zero warmth. The people pleaser has warmth but no power. The distracted genius has presence issues. You need all three.

**Pro move:** Before any social situation, take 60 seconds. Stand up straight. Breathe deep. Tell yourself ""I'm here to make people feel good."" This primes all three elements.

# Step 3: Get Comfortable with Silence

Awkward silence makes most people panic. They fill it with nervous chatter or dumb comments. Charming people? They're cool with silence. They let it breathe.

When someone finishes talking, wait two full seconds before responding. This does two things: Shows you're actually thinking about what they said, and gives them space to add more if they want.

Vanessa Van Edwards (behavioral investigator, runs Science of People) has a whole YouTube series on this. She analyzed thousands of hours of social interactions. The most charismatic people use pauses strategically. It creates anticipation. Makes your words hit harder when you do speak.

# Step 4: Use the Triangle Gaze

This is stupidly simple but works like magic. When talking to someone, don't lock eyes the whole time like a serial killer. Move your gaze in a triangle: left eye, right eye, mouth. Stay on each point for 2-3 seconds.

It feels natural. Shows you're engaged. And there's research backing this up from the Journal of Social Psychology. Direct eye contact builds trust, but TOO much is threatening. The triangle keeps you in the sweet spot.

Also, when someone's talking, nod slightly. Not like a bobblehead. Just small acknowledgments. It signals you're tracking what they're saying.

# Step 5: Tell Stories That Land

Here's the thing about stories. Most people tell them wrong. They include way too many details, lose the thread, or make themselves the hero in a weird way.

**The formula:** Set the scene fast (one sentence). Build tension (what went wrong or what was at stake). Resolution (what happened, what you learned). Keep it under 90 seconds.

Matthew Dicks won multiple Moth GrandSlams (storytelling competitions) and wrote ""Storyworthy"". His technique: Every story needs a ""five-second moment"" where something changed. Not the big external event. The tiny internal shift. That's what people connect with.

**Example:** Don't say ""I climbed Mount Everest and it was hard."" Say ""At 20,000 feet, my guide asked if I wanted to turn back. For five seconds I stood there realizing I'd rather fail trying than never know."" See the difference?

If you want a more structured way to absorb all this, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia and Google that pulls from communication books, behavioral psychology research, and expert insights to create personalized audio content.

You can set a goal like ""become more charismatic as someone who gets anxious in social situations"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan specifically for that. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples when something clicks. Plus you get a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with about specific struggles. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a sarcastic narrator if that's your thing. Makes the whole learning process feel less like work and more like having a conversation.

# Step 6: Match Energy, Then Lead

When you first meet someone, mirror their energy level. If they're calm and quiet, don't come in like a tornado. If they're hyped up, bring some energy.

This is called **pacing and leading**. You pace their state first (builds rapport), then gradually lead them to where you want the vibe to go. It's subtle but incredibly effective.

Chris Voss, former FBI hostage negotiator, talks about this in ""Never Split the Difference"". He used mirroring to de-escalate armed standoffs. You're not negotiating for hostages, but the psychology is the same. Match first, then guide.

# Step 7: Give Genuine Compliments

Forget generic bullshit like ""nice shirt."" Anyone can say that.

Notice something specific and non-obvious. ""The way you explained that concept made it finally click for me"" or ""You have this energy that makes people want to open up.""

The key word is **specific**. Vague compliments feel like ass-kissing. Specific ones feel like you actually paid attention.

And here's the kicker: compliment people on things they chose or worked for, not just genetic luck. Don't go ""wow you're tall."" Say ""your presentation style is really engaging."" One is lazy, the other shows you noticed their effort.

# Step 8: Remember Names and Details

Dale Carnegie wrote ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" back in 1936 and this shit still holds up. He said a person's name is the sweetest sound to them in any language.

**Here's the hack:** When someone tells you their name, repeat it immediately. ""Nice to meet you, Sarah."" Then use it naturally once or twice in conversation. Your brain will lock it in better.

Go further. Remember one detail they mentioned. Next time you see them, bring it up. ""Hey, how'd that job interview go?"" They'll be shocked you remembered. That's charm gold.

# Step 9: Make People Feel Safe

This is the secret sauce nobody talks about. Charm is rooted in making people feel safe around you. Safe to be themselves. Safe to be vulnerable. Safe to be weird.

**How?** Don't judge. Don't gossip about others (because if you gossip TO someone, they assume you'll gossip ABOUT them). Don't make everything a competition.

Brené Brown's research on vulnerability shows that people are drawn to those who create psychological safety. When you admit your own mistakes or uncertainties first, others feel permission to do the same. That's when real connection happens.

Try this: Share something slightly embarrassing or imperfect about yourself early in conversation. Not trauma dumping. Just being real. ""I completely blanked on my presentation this morning, had to wing half of it."" Boom. You're human. They can relax now.

# Step 10: Exit Conversations Like a Pro

Nobody teaches you this, but how you leave a conversation matters as much as how you enter it.

Don't ghost mid-sentence. Don't fake getting a phone call. Just be direct and warm: ""I've got to catch up with someone, but this was great. Let's continue this later.""

Or introduce them to someone else before you leave. ""Hey, you need to meet James, he's also into hiking."" Now you've added value and made a smooth exit.

The charming person leaves people wanting more, not wondering why you bolted awkwardly.

# Real Talk

Look, you're not going to nail all of this immediately. You'll forget names. You'll interrupt people. You'll tell a story that bombs. That's fine. Charm isn't perfection.

It's the consistent practice of making people feel seen, heard, and valued. That's it. Do that enough and you'll be the person everyone gravitates toward, whether you're at a house party, a work function, or just getting coffee.

Start with one thing from this list. Master it. Then add another. In six months, you'll walk into rooms differently. People will respond to you differently. And you'll realize charm was never about being someone else. It's about being the best version of yourself while making others feel good.

1rajxa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/gurgaon/comments/1rajxa9/feeling_slightly_fucked_up_after_moving_back/,Feeling slightly fucked up after moving back,"Hey r/gurgaon 

I've been lurking on this and similar subs for a bit, and seen rarely any similar posts. I finally decided to put this out there because I'm genuinely struggling. I moved back from the US about a month ago; primarily for family health reasons (serious issues that required me to be here right away) and because I'm an only child with no siblings to share the responsibilities. Family is pretty important, so it was the only real choice, but the shift has hit hard already (I declined the H1B offer I got to move back). The pollution, crowds, traffic, and overall energy feel like a massive downgrade from what I had stateside, and socially, I've been feeling pretty dissatisfied, frustrated, and a bit lost.

Background on me: I went to an elite school in India growing up, so I had that exposure early on. Then studied and worked in the US (growth consulting and real estate development), went to college through COVID-the crowd was limited, and many international people around were from extremely elite backgrounds. The Indians I met in college there were also truly the crème de la crème-decent YPO/ YNG types and similar, ambitious, worldly, but rarely with real depth and drive. It wasn't always easy to build deep friendships, but it shaped my global, ambitious mindset. Here, I'm solidly middle to upper-middle class-not ultra-rich by any stretch-but I've been around that world through my experiences, work networks and deals. I'm not being classist or elitist; I just need to find people on a similar intellectual and ambition wavelength to collaborate with, grow alongside, and build real friendships. Even if it's not a perfect match on every interest, I don't want to keep feeling this messed up and out of place.

Most recently, I've been offered to join the family business in real estate, but honestly, I don't want to go down that path-not because of the work itself, but mainly because of the kind of people I'd be surrounded by day-to-day (barrier to entry in real estate is pretty low), and sometimes clients too. A lot of them come across as wealthy but crude/ unrefined in ways that don't align with me at all, and I just don't vibe with that environment. Even in the relatively ""good"" places-well-rated spots, expensive venues, upscale areas-the quality of people often doesn't feel great to me. I don't like going clubbing either; it's not my scene (been there done that in south Delhi can't even think about going to other places)

Right now, I've paused all work stuff for about a month to sort my headspace (yes I'm that fucked but also privileged enough to be able to afford this) and figure out next steps. In the meantime I stick to my usual stuff; I stay super active through lifting in my gym sessions, focusing on fitness and nutrition to keep sharp. Reading is a huge part of my routine: business, finance, productivity hacks, philosophy, art, history, religion (I'm just starting to get into world religions more deeply), a slight touch of politics (more global affairs than local drama). I thrive on thoughtful discussions-over coffee, a walk, brainstorming ideas, or even potential side hustles. I'm ambitious and want to build my own legacy business someday-something meaningful and impactful.

Personality-wise, I'm fun and chill-love house music (I've seen most of the major artists live and traveled the world for it), smoke bud sometimes, rarely drink.

I game sometimes mostly for recreation alone). My old friends are solid for casual hangs, but we've grown in different directions, and conversations rarely go deep like I need. I'm ready to put in the effort to build new circles with people who have real exposure-global experiences, curiosity, depth-without just being rich and “gavaar”.

If you’ve been through a similar returnee adjustment, or have tips, opinions, or perspectives on some things I’ve talked about, I’d love to hear them. Or if you’re in the same boat and want to chat/DM, that’s cool too—no pressure, just looking for some solidarity and real talk.

Thanks in advance for any thoughts,

1rajwmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1rajwmg/i_26f_accused_my_husband_29m_of_cheating_with_no/,I (26f) accused my husband (29m) of cheating with no proof… advice?,"I have no concrete proof I just felt like since we’ve had our  kid he’s been cheating.

For a little context we have been together for a total of 8 years and been married for 3 of those years. We had a baby 1 year ago. We’ve not been intimate since I was like 5 months pregnant, so that was middleish of 2024. We also just purchased and moved into our own house at this time, moving from his parents house about 20 mins away. I had complications and then a c section that added to this but after we had the baby and he went back to work he has just been relentlessly rude.

Freshly postpartum he was great and did everything right. He’d help me to the bathroom, made all the meals, changed all the diapers for 4 weeks and then he had to go back to work. He was a salaried manager working “40 hours” a week which without fail was more like 50-60 hours a week since he was a manager he “had” to stay and fix things since he was the only person that knew a damn thing at that place. He worked night shift and would come home anytime between 9 to midnight. Once he started working again we tried taking shifts at night so I could get some sleep, but with the stress from work and lack of sleep he started having night terrors and would wake up screaming. So I stopped waking him up for shifts and took it all on.

He has never been a super sweet or romantic guy but after I stopped working and we had the baby it seemed more like he was the one having postpartum depression. Everything was a complaint to the point of, if he was talking to me it was only to complain. At some point, about 2 months PP I started bed sharing with the baby because it was the only way for me to get sleep and allow him to get sleep for work. And he felt “kicked out” even though I had never told him to leave the room or the bed. He started sleeping on the floor at the foot of the bed and eventually got tired of that and went to sleep on the couch. He’s been on the couch since then.

As time went on his resentment only grew. I was and still sort of am in a “mama bear” mind set, baby was 10 weeks old and it was about to be Easter and I didn’t really want to go anywhere. I just wanted to stay home and not be forced to go along with other people holiday plans. Well, he was planning to go to the shooting range with people from his work, which included his female assistant manager, who I will refer to as M.  Prior I didn’t have a problem with her but several months before this he had off handed mentioned that she was having family and husband problems and needed more of a work life balance, so he adjusted her schedule to help her out. Okay, whatever.

Easter comes up and I tell him it’s messed up to go to the range on our sons first Easter and that he should be spending it with us, not people he sees everything single day and is around more than us. After a lot of arguing he gave up and said he wasn’t going to leave. Obviously, the day was ruined after that. Time goes on and nothing gets better. We argue about the dumbest things, regularly ending in screaming matches. And I mean it is something weekly. 

Eventually every day off he’d get he would be going to his parents house and spending hours there talking about our marriage to them and complaining about me. I know this for a fact. So every time his parents came around they would interrogate me about whatever he had been bringing up to them. I eventually I told him to stop talking to your parents about our marriage or I was done. I’ve never even hinted about anything negative about him to my family. They all think he’s great to me. 

He said he’d stop talking about me behind my back and we moved on. 

I’m logged in to his Starbucks app and I’ve noticed on occasion (I would get a push notification) that he’d buy a second drink, a tea when he ordered. He’s an only black coffee kind of person. So when I brought it up to him he flipped out on me saying he bought it for his male store manager and said that I was stalking / tracking him and he didn’t appreciate it. Brought it up it in several arguments that I “track” him. Literally so paranoid that I’m tracking him he wouldn’t even turn on “find my iPhone” so he could ping his AirPods because he thought I’d find a way to track him since we’re family sharing on the phones. 

I never brought it up again. Recently, in January when I saw him in the morning he had scratches all around his neck. Clearly fingernail marks. I asked him what that was and he response was just “i dont know “ later he took off his shirt to go and shower and he clear has day had a whole hand of fingernail scratches across his back. 

I know that he has a thing for this sexually. To dig your nails into him while you’re having sex. So to me that was just glaringly obvious. I didn’t say anything. 

I was planning to try and get evidence, unlock his phone and see if anything was there when I got a chance but it just never came up. Days after this he was laid off from his job (at no fault of his own) and I forgot for a while. 

Assistant Manager M would still text/call for work advice, reassurance and to gossip about what was going on a work since he was gone. I was uncomfortable with this but didn’t say anything. 

Well, the other day we went to pick up a few things from his work, I went in since I wanted to stretch my legs and as soon as she saw him (she had called him as we were on the way there to say another person was laid off, so knew that he was coming) brought him a coffee she bought for him and said “I just figured I’d get you another one, one last time. “ 

All things considered this really just ticked me off. In his call with M he found out the store manager lost his job and she said he should apply for it. And said it multiple times how great it’d be for him to be working there again because they need him and whatever else. And he was VERY insistent that he would apply for it. 

So despite me wanting to gather some sort of evidence before confronting him this put me over the edge. This morning my baby knocked over my cup of Gatorade I had sitting on the floor and it spilled. Husband freaked out and grabbed our stick vacuum and started to vacuum the wet carpet. I yelled at him to stop because it’s a vacuum… not meant for that. He screamed at me, his go to saying, “look it up” and that it can suck up water. 

In fact, he did this once before and we had to take the vacuum apart and let it dry outside because it got messed up. Well I did look it up and big surprise it cannot and is not meant for that. 

He went on a huge screaming tirade that “he’s just stupid” and thought it could do that and he specifically chose that one because it could. But I looked it up so I’m right, congrats. Asked him why he was being so rude to me and he said that I was rude first because i told him to stop and that if he electrocuted him self then he’d know he was wrong. 

Well that was my last straw. he was planning to leave the house right after that so I just plainly asked if he was sleeping with M or anyone else. And his response was just (not screaming, yelling or anything) “wtf I’ve never slept with anyone else while I’ve been with you” I explained my reasoning above for being suspicious and he had zero answers just kept repeating the same thing then asking me what he should do, because “I can’t prove I wasn’t cheating if I wasn’t doing anything” 

I said that’s not a good enough answer and I need an explanation for the scratches on his back. All he said was i dont know and I don’t have an explanation. Then he said he’d take a polygraph 🙄 do any testing I wanted, etc. I said okay get some STD testing done. On the spot he called and made an appointment for next week. Not sure if he thought that would pacify me, but regardless of the results I’m waiting for an explanation of the scratches. He said if he had an explanation for that it would be a lie because he doesn’t know where it came from. 

I sarcastically asked if our house is possessed by a demon and scratched him tf up and got the same i dont know /no explanation answer. 

When I asked him if it was appropriate to still be communicating with M, he said “probably not” 

OH. And I will add in one of our last arguments I was getting on him for never taking accountability for the things he does and always shifting gears and blaming other people or turning it around to blame me and he admitted that yes he does that, always has and is “working” on it. 

Since me accusing him we’ve basically just ignored the problem since he couldn’t get past his “i dont know”s and we were in a stalemate. Only talked to each other when we have had to. 

TLDR. 

Ive been suspicious of him cheating because we’ve not had sex in over a year, (my choice because he’s been an asshole). I’ve noticed he’s been too friendly with a female from work. I was going to try and gather evidence to prove my theory but I couldn’t help it and straight up asked him if he was. He denied it and had no explanation for things I’ve noticed in the past. Since this morning we’ve only talked when we’ve needed to and not brought up anything else.  

Not sure where to go from here. 

I’m sure I’ve forgotten things and will answer any questions if needed. ",1,1771655322.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

I moved back from the US about a month ago; primarily for family health reasons (serious issues that required me to be here right away) and because I'm an only child with no siblings to share the responsibilities. Family is pretty important, so it was the only real choice, but the shift has hit hard already (I declined the H1B offer I got to move back). The pollution, crowds, traffic, and overall energy feel like a massive downgrade from what I had stateside, and socially, I've been feeling pretty dissatisfied, frustrated, and a bit lost.

Background on me: I went to an elite school in India growing up, so I had that exposure early on. Then studied and worked in the US (growth consulting and real estate development), went to college through COVID-the crowd was limited, and many international people around were from extremely elite backgrounds. The Indians I met in college there were also truly the crème de la crème-decent YPO/ YNG types and similar, ambitious, worldly, but rarely with real depth and drive. It wasn't always easy to build deep friendships, but it shaped my global, ambitious mindset. Here, I'm solidly middle to upper-middle class-not ultra-rich by any stretch-but I've been around that world through my experiences, work networks and deals. I'm not being classist or elitist; I just need to find people on a similar intellectual and ambition wavelength to collaborate with, grow alongside, and build real friendships. Even if it's not a perfect match on every interest, I don't want to keep feeling this messed up and out of place.

Most recently, I've been offered to join the family business in real estate, but honestly, I don't want to go down that path-not because of the work itself, but mainly because of the kind of people I'd be surrounded by day-to-day (barrier to entry in real estate is pretty low), and sometimes clients too. A lot of them come across as wealthy but crude/ unrefined in ways that don't align with me at all, and I just don't vibe with that environment. Even in the relatively ""good"" places-well-rated spots, expensive venues, upscale areas-the quality of people often doesn't feel great to me. I don't like going clubbing either; it's not my scene (been there done that in south Delhi can't even think about going to other places)

Right now, I've paused all work stuff for about a month to sort my headspace (yes I'm that fucked but also privileged enough to be able to afford this) and figure out next steps. In the meantime I stick to my usual stuff; I stay super active through lifting in my gym sessions, focusing on fitness and nutrition to keep sharp. Reading is a huge part of my routine: business, finance, productivity hacks, philosophy, art, history, religion (I'm just starting to get into world religions more deeply), a slight touch of politics (more global affairs than local drama). I thrive on thoughtful discussions-over coffee, a walk, brainstorming ideas, or even potential side hustles. I'm ambitious and want to build my own legacy business someday-something meaningful and impactful.

Personality-wise, I'm fun and chill-love house music (I've seen most of the major artists live and traveled the world for it), smoke bud sometimes, rarely drink.

I game sometimes mostly for recreation alone). My old friends are solid for casual hangs, but we've grown in different directions, and conversations rarely go deep like I need. I'm ready to put in the effort to build new circles with people who have real exposure-global experiences, curiosity, depth-without just being rich and “gavaar”.

If you’ve been through a similar returnee adjustment, or have tips, opinions, or perspectives on some things I’ve talked about, I’d love to hear them. Or if you’re in the same boat and want to chat/DM, that’s cool too—no pressure, just looking for some solidarity and real talk.

I've had to start hypertension medication in the past year and am currently on 5mg of ramipril that might need to be increased. I have a family history of hypertension and high cholesterol.

9 months ago I did a blood test and my cholesterol numbers were high: Total cholesterol was 224 and LDL was 160. The specialist treating my hypertension wasn't super concerned and I was already active but improved my diet, cutting out cheese and medium ground beef that I was eating quite a lot of, switching from full fat milk with my oats and coffee to 1% and increasing my fibre intake and eating more legumes. I've thoroughly reduced my saturated fat and meat consumption.  

After 9 months of eating well consistently and watching my saturated fat intake I did another test and the results came back at total cholesterol: 255 and LDL 180.   
I have been even more active during this period and feel and look the healthiest I've been in my life. Has anyone had any similar experiences? Seems as though I'll need to start taking a statin but was wondering if there's any explanation for the increase despite improved diet?",1,1771655197.0,Cholesterol,0,1.0,False

Like... what does 38 feel like? Because I still get excited about pizza for dinner. I still laugh at dumb memes. I still stay up too late doing absolutely nothing productive. I still discover new music and get obsessed with random hobbies. I still feel butterflies about things.

The only difference between me now and me at 25 is that my hangovers last three days and I own a label maker that I'm unreasonably proud of.

I think we put way too much weight on these numbers. Like there's some switch that flips and suddenly you're supposed to be ""old"" or ""settled"" or whatever. But inside? I'm the same person I've always been. Same sense of humor, same curiosity, same energy (okay, slightly less energy, but coffee exists).

Age is really just a number we assigned to rotations around the sun. It doesn't define your capacity for joy, or growth, or spontaneity, or any of the stuff that actually matters.

So yeah, 38 tomorrow. But I'm still young at heart, still down for adventure, still figuring life out, still evolving. The number changes but the person? Still here. Still me.

We are both in our early thirties.

How do you know a guy is really interested in you and not your, hm, financials? 
I met this guy, we have been together for over a year, same age, but he's always in some sort of financial trouble. He doesn't want to work a ""regular job 9-5"". He constantly had this, kind of childish and outlandish ideas, of how to earn an income. Sometimes he can't make rent. He is the Sweetest, most adorable person I have ever met. We barely have any problems in our relationship.


We live in two cities that are about 300km apart. I always pay for our meetups, or go to meet him and stay in his apartment. I don't mind paying for all the coffees, and diners, but I want a partner who is financially stable and can do the same. Now, I know his field of work is way too overcrowded, and I have seen his work, he really is astounding. However, I am also being realistic and I know he is going to have a very tough time to break through and make a living out of this. I feel kind of stuck. This is the best relationship I have ever had. I don't want to stifle him and smother his dreams and creativity, but on the other hand, it feels like he's not being grounded/realistic on what it takes to survive and make rent every month. I am completely lost. Ang advice would be appreciated.

Edit: he is in a very creative field of work, and while he has had success before, it's nowhere near to fiance a regular ""way of living"", meaning rent + food. He has been doing some side gigs that keep him afloat, barely.

Edit  2. I also have this irrational fear that if he ever makes it big, that he will leave me for somebody else. That he sees me as his meal ticket through the rough times. ",2,1771654541.0,AskGaybrosOver30,1,1.0,False

For the first few years I was just raw dogging life and finally one of my friends who is a psychiatrist put me on Zoloft which was fine for a while but didn’t make much of a difference but I kept on taking it for a couple of years and life was okay. I was always scared of driving and would worry to be alone. 

When I got married I realised this is wrong and I started going to different psychiatrists. This one psychiatrist found out that I diagnosed me with ADHD at the age of 32 and put me on Ritalin and prolexa. Life was smooth and I had it under control to some extent that I could have somewhat normal life. 

About a year back I had a fall and the impact was on my left elbow. Nothing serious but ever since my left arm and shoulder had been acting funny got all the tests done and nothing came up. 

So one day my heartrate goes up to 150bpm and I rush to the emergency by then it was at 240bpm. The docs gave me enderal 20mg and that’s it. I got all my heart tests done and nothing came up. Now since the very beginning my resting heartrate has been 90-110bpm. Coffee had a huge role in it so had to quite. 

Now here is the shitty part I’m on 4 meds I have to control my heartrate all the time which give me anxiety all the time and there are certain meds for example Pequit that I refuse to take because it makes me feel high and brings my heartrate to 60s which scares me so I don’t take it. 

Currently I’m on Valium, enderal, busron, and prolexa. Pequit too but I don’t take it. And any mild painkiller to get rid of the pain in my arm

My anxiety is through the roof all the time. I recently lost my job due to unprofessional behaviour due to my health issues. I couldn’t explain my boss why it was all happening. And here I am with a bunch of meds still anxious, jobless and creativity spilling out of my head but nothing to make of it. 

I don’t care if it’s called GAD or ADHD or whatever anyone wants to make of it. 

I just want to be a little normal and not worry that I will have a stroke or something and survive. I don’t want to worry every second. 

I’m not asking for medical advice or anything like that. Just want to know that I’m not the only one because this shit is lonely as hell. I can’t tell my wife all this and the kids are too young to understand. I feel so done finding companionship and support in the wrong places.

I met this guy, we have been together for over a year, same age, but he's always in some sort of financial trouble. He doesn't want to work a ""regular job 9-5"". He constantly had this, kind of childish and outlandish ideas, of how to earn an income. Sometimes he can't make rent. He is the Sweetest, most adorable person I have ever met. We barely have any problems in our relationship.


We live in two cities that are about 300km apart. I always pay for our meetups, or go to meet him and stay in his apartment. I don't mind paying for all the coffees, and diners, but I want a partner who is financially stable and can do the same. Now, I know his field of work is way too overcrowded, and I have seen his work, he really is astounding. However, I am also being realistic and I know he is going to have a very tough time to break through and make a living out of this. I feel kind of stuck. This is the best relationship I have ever had. I don't want to stifle him and smother his dreams and creativity, but on the other hand, it feels like he's not being grounded/realistic on what it takes to survive and make rent every month. I am completely lost. Ang advice would be appreciated.

Edit: he is in a very creative field of work, and while he has had success before, it's nowhere near to fiance a regular ""way of living"", meaning rent + food. He has been doing some side gigs that keep him afloat, barely.

Edit  2. I also have this irrational fear that if he ever makes it big, that he will leave me for somebody else. That he sees me as his meal ticket through the rough times. ",1,1771653632.0,askgaybros,1,1.0,False

The group was so diverse - different ages, backgrounds, personalities. A few said they were introverts. But at some point, everyone opened up. We spoke for hours and genuinely didn’t realise how quickly time passed. 😭🫂

It didn’t feel forced. It didn’t feel performative. Just people showing up and talking.

You know, I had a great betting night – but I'm salty AF about how *Pick of the Day* shook out. No joke, I just about hit everything *except* that pick. But I'll come back to that – here's what I had/sent out this morning:



**VIP Parlay (+400)** 🎉

\-MEM Grizzlies Team Total Over 118.5 (-115) ✅

\-MIA Heat ML (-165) ✅

\-CLE Cavaliers -4.5 (-150) (alternate spread) ✅



**Picks (2/3)**

\-UTA Jazz v MEM Grizzlies Over 236.5 (-110) ✅

\-OKC Thunder -18.0 (-110) ✅

‍-IND Pacers v WAS Wizards Under 230.5 (-110)  ❌



**Player Props (3/4)**

\-CLE Cavaliers v CHA Hornets: Jarrett Allen Over 15.5 Points (-120) ✅

\-DEN Nuggets v POR Trail Blazers: Jrue Holiday Over 15.5 Points (-105) ✅

\-DEN Nuggets v POR Trail Blazers: Jamal Murray Over 24.5 Points (-120) ✅

‍-MIA Heat v ATL Hawks: Bam Adebayo Over 32.5 Points, Assists & Rebounds (-105) ❌

  
**In short:** I absolutely crushed this day (and the last couple weeks, to be honest)! I'm thrilled. I thought the Pacers/Wizards Under was going into the bag easy after they only scored 49 points in the first quarter. 

And then, somehow, both squads magically turned from those little Space Jam aliens into the ""Monstars"" and bagged a whopping 76 points in the second quarter 😂 Like WHAT?! Honestly, I can't even be mad at games that take a crazy turn like that... Just the way it goes sometimes.

Overall, it was a great night. I hope you all had a solid betting day :)

As always, I’ll see you all bright and early to conquer the books.

I work a lot and have been very successful in my career — but that leaves me with little time for a social life. Most of my friends are married and have kids, so seeing them regularly is tough. So… here I am! 

I lean politically liberal (the “blue side,” as some say!), so I’d especially enjoy chatting with folks who share similar values. That said — no pressure or judgment! I’ll also kindly note that I’m not especially drawn to video games or sports fandom (if watching hours of games or matches isn’t your idea of fun either — bonus points! 🌟).I’m hoping to chat with kind, thoughtful people aged 25–46, living in the U.S. or Canada.

 Episode 1: “The Vanishing of Izuku Midoriya”

 Cold Open — The Facility

Night.

A classified government Quirk Research Facility outside Musutafu.

Alarms blare.

Scientists run through white hallways.

Security radios crackle.

“Containment breach in Sector 7!”

A heavy door trembles violently.

Inside the dark chamber—

Something moves.

A guard slowly approaches the hallway.

The lights flicker.

A tall, twisted silhouette appears at the end of the corridor.

The guard backs away—

The lights explode.

Cut to black.

\---

Basement Scene

Bakugo’s basement.

Dice roll across a table.

Deku is deep into explaining strategy.

“If we combine quirks here, the success rate jumps to 42%—”

“JUST ROLL!” Bakugo shouts.

Denki laughs. Todoroki watches calmly.

Thunder rumbles.

They finish the game and head out on their bikes.

\---

 The Disappearance

Fog creeps along the road.

The boys split off one by one.

Deku rides alone.

His bike light flickers.

He hears something behind him.

A clicking, wet sound.

He looks back—

Nothing.

He pedals faster.

The wind dies suddenly.

Dead silence.

He reaches his house… but the door slowly creaks open on its own.

Inside, the lights flicker.

The phone rings.

He answers.

Only static.

Behind him—

A shadow stretches unnaturally long across the wall.

Cut to black.

☀️ Morning — All Might (Hopper Role)

Police station.

All Might, now thinner in his weakened form, drinks coffee while half-listening to reports.

A call comes in.

“Missing child. Izuku Midoriya.”

His expression changes.

He knew that kid.

He stands up immediately.

“No one vanishes in my town,” he says quietly.

He drives to Deku’s house.

Inko is in tears.

All Might kneels gently.

“We’ll find him. I promise.”

Outside, he looks toward the forest.

Something about this feels wrong.

\---

🧪 The Girl Escapes

Deep in the woods.

A girl in a hospital gown stumbles through the trees.

Nejire.

Barefoot.

Confused.

Helicopter lights sweep overhead.

Men in tactical gear search nearby.

Nejire hides behind a tree.

A soldier gets too close.

She raises her hand—

The soldier is thrown backward by invisible force.

She gasps, frightened of her own power.

She runs.

\---

 The Boys Search

Bakugo slams his locker shut.

“He didn’t run away.”

Denki whispers, “What if it’s villain-related?”

Todoroki says quietly, “We search tonight.”

They grab flashlights.

Ride toward the woods.

\---

 The Other Side

Deku wakes up in a dark, twisted version of Musutafu.

The sky is red.

Ash floats like snow.

He runs to a small shed and locks himself inside.

The door handle begins to shake slowly.

A low growl echoes.

Deku grips a pipe.

The door creaks open—

A tall, faceless creature steps inside.

Deku screams.

CUT TO BLACK.

 Episode 2: “The Girl with the Spiral Eyes”

\---

 Cold Open — The Other Side

Dark.

Red sky.

Ash drifting like snow.

Deku runs through the twisted forest.

Vines crawl over dead trees. Buildings in the distance look warped, like melting shadows of Musutafu.

Behind him—

That same tall creature stalks silently.

No eyes.

No face.

Just a stretched silhouette with twitching limbs.

Deku hides behind a rotting tree trunk, covering his mouth to stop his breathing.

The creature pauses.

Its head slowly turns… almost sensing him.

Deku’s walkie-talkie (clipped to his belt from last night) suddenly crackles with static.

The creature snaps toward the sound.

Deku bolts.

CUT.

\---

All Might Investigates

Police station.

All Might stands over a map of Musutafu.

Search areas circled in red.

An officer speaks:

“No footprints. Bike was found near the woods.”

All Might’s jaw tightens.

He drives alone to the forest road.

He studies the ground carefully.

Sees something strange.

Burn-like marks in the dirt.

But not fire.

Almost like the air itself warped the soil.

He whispers to himself:

“This isn’t a normal villain…”

His eyes drift toward the distant research facility.

The same one that had an “electrical malfunction” last night.

He doesn’t believe that for a second.

\---

 The Lab

Inside the secret facility.

A stern scientist reviews camera footage.

The tape glitches.

In the static—

A faint image of Deku flickers for half a second.

Alive.

Somewhere else.

The scientist freezes the frame.

“Open the Gate wider,” he orders coldly.

\---

 The Boys Find Something

Night.

Bakugo, Todoroki, and Denki ride toward the forest.

They find Deku’s abandoned bike.

Denki kneels down.

“Okay, that’s not good.”

Bakugo clenches his fists. “He was right here.”

Suddenly—

They hear rustling.

Flashlights snap toward the sound.

A figure steps out slowly.

Barefoot.

Hospital gown.

Long indigo hair.

Nejire.

She squints at the light.

Bakugo steps forward cautiously.

“Who are you?”

She tilts her head.

“…Izuku.”

All three boys freeze.

“How do you know that name?” Todoroki asks sharply.

Nejire looks confused, like the word just came to her.

She whispers again:

“Izuku.”

Denki gulps. “Yeah okay she’s not normal.”

\---

 Basement Hideout Scene

They sneak Nejire into Bakugo’s basement.

She studies everything with wide curiosity.

The lights flicker slightly around her when she concentrates.

Denki offers her chips.

She pokes the bag suspiciously.

Bakugo kneels in front of her.

“Do you know where he is?”

Nejire closes her eyes.

The room hums softly.

The lights begin to pulse.

A wave of energy ripples outward—

The boys hear faint static.

Then—

Deku’s voice.

Very faint.

“…Kacchan…”

Bakugo’s eyes widen.

Denki drops his chips.

Todoroki stares at Nejire in disbelief.

The voice fades.

The lights go back to normal.

Nejire opens her eyes.

“He’s not here,” she says softly.

“Not in your world.”

Silence fills the basement.

 Toru & Mineta Parallel Plot

At school.

Toru sits in the bathroom with a radio, trying to tune into news about Deku.

Mineta leans against the wall acting confident.

“I’m sure it’s nothing. Probably ran away.”

Toru looks at him.

“You don’t believe that.”

He doesn’t respond.

Later that night, Mineta drives around town trying to look brave… but keeps glancing nervously at the woods.

Even he feels it.

Something is wrong.

\---

🚔 All Might Confronts the Lab

All Might arrives at the research facility.

Guards block his path.

“This is restricted government property.”

All Might smiles politely.

“I just have a few questions.”

The head scientist comes out.

Calm. Cold.

“We had no incidents.”

All Might’s eyes narrow.

“You expect me to believe that?”

For a moment—

Tension.

The air between them feels heavy.

All Might senses something being hidden.

But he leaves.

For now.

\---

🌑 Final Scene — The Wall

In the Upside Down version of Musutafu—

Deku hides inside his house.

The walls pulse like living tissue.

He grabs Christmas lights hanging nearby.

He begins smashing letters into the wall using broken glass.

The wall flickers between dimensions.

In Bakugo’s basement—

The lights begin to blink in a pattern.

Denki notices first.

“Wait… that’s Morse code.”

Blink. Blink. Pause.

Bakugo steps closer.

The bulbs spell one word across the wall in glowing light:

ALIVE

The boys stare in shock.

Nejire watches silently.

Her eyes glow faint blue.

Cut to black.

It always varies for me but sometimes I could go like 3 days w out going to the bathroom and it shouldn’t affect me as much as it does, it totally affects my mood and the way I think. If I don’t go to the bathroom for 2 days I just internally freak out and have a bad mindset, pooping is a way to get rid of toxins in ur body and so that scares me that I can go days without doing that, it also just makes me feel gross not going. The only way I can go is if I drink a strong coffee or just luck. Sometimes I can go w out that but i definitely don’t go everyday and I feel like I’m doing something wrong. I came on here because obviously it has to do w the gut and I wanna make some changes, I need to figure out how to start having a bowel movement everyday because I rlly struggle. Idk if I’m allowed to ask on here but does anyone have tips? Advice? Does this happen to anyone else on here lol. ",2,1771653180.0,GutHealth,0,1.0,False
1raj8vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1raj8vg/that_quiet_café_in_lisbon_became_my_office_for_a/,That quiet café in Lisbon became my office for a week: how embracing solitude unlocked new travel habits ☕,"That feeling of hitting a new city and thinking you *have* to see absolutely everything? I've been there. Booking tours back-to-back, ticking off landmarks, and ending the day more tired than truly enriched. Lisbon was different. I arrived with a vague plan, a laptop, and an open mind, and what started as a practical necessity – finding a quiet spot to catch up on some remote work – turned into a complete shift in how I approach trips. My office for a week became a small, unassuming café down a cobbled street in Alfama, and embracing that solitude actually helped me see more of Lisbon than any crowded tour ever could.

Here's how that week unfolded:

*   **The Office:** My ""office"" was a family-run spot I mentally dubbed ""Café da Esquina."" It had three small tables, a counter, and the owner knew everyone's order after day two. It wasn't fancy, just honest.
    *   **Cost Check:** An espresso and a pastel de nata set me back about €2.50. Simple, fresh lunches were around €7-€9. It was a budget-friendly anchor to my day.
*   **My Setup:** My well-worn laptop, a journal, and a comfortable corner seat. I’d be there from about 9:30 AM to 1 PM most weekdays. This wasn't about ""digital nomad Instagram life""; it was about getting my actual work done so I could genuinely switch off and explore without that nagging feeling of unfinished tasks.
*   **Accommodation:** A basic, clean Airbnb studio in Graça, near a convenient tram stop. Nothing luxurious, just functional. It was around €70 a night during the shoulder season.
*   **New Habits Unlocked:**
    *   **Slower Pace:** No frantic rushing. I’d watch the city wake up from my café window, noticing details I'd usually miss.
    *   **Observation Over Consumption:** Less about seeing *everything* on a list, more about truly *seeing* a few things deeply.
    *   **Accidental Local Immersion:** By not being a tourist on a strict schedule, I stumbled into local bakeries, markets, and genuine conversations with shopkeepers.
    *   **Flexible Itinerary:** My ""plan"" for the afternoon was often decided by what caught my eye on a paper map, a local's recommendation, or simply a street that looked interesting.
    *   **Mindful Eating:** Enjoying meals without distraction, rather than grabbing something on the go between sights.

It wasn't all picturesque introspection, though. The first day, a pang of guilt hit me. ""Shouldn't I be out seeing Jerónimos Monastery *right now*?"" I wondered. There were moments of quiet awkwardness, too, sitting alone in a bustling café while others chatted in groups. But that initial discomfort soon faded. I learned to appreciate the rhythm of the place, the consistent hum of the espresso machine, and the gentle Portuguese chatter around me.

The biggest surprise was how much *more* I experienced by doing *less*. Instead of racing through museums, I spent an hour sketching a single intricate tile pattern in a quiet courtyard. Instead of taking a crowded tram up to a viewpoint, I walked the hilly streets, discovering tiny, sun-drenched squares and incredible street art I'd never have found otherwise. I picked up a few basic Portuguese phrases not from a textbook, but from trying to order my coffee and bread. And because I wasn't constantly distracted by a ""to-do"" list of sights, I actually felt present. The challenges were minor – occasional Wi-Fi hiccups, the temptation to scroll instead of work – but the payoff of truly experiencing a place on my own terms was immense.

1raj8b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1raj8b3/no_longer_his_donna/,No Longer His Donna,"Chapter 1 

When I arrived home with the gift I had carefully chosen for Xander, the house was empty except for a table 

laden with fresh flowers. 

Cheers and laughter drifted from row house garden, and a cold dread settled in my stomach with each step. 

“Don Xander, you are truly blessed, such a fine son and such a lovely Donna,” came the teasing voices of 

Capo from nearby. 

My whole body stiffened, refusing to believe what I had just heard. 

A few more steps, and I saw him. 

Xander was cradling an infant. A voluptuous woman stood beside him, her arm linked through his. 

“Yes, I am. But above all, Stephanie deserves the credit,” he said, his voice dripping with a tenderness I had 

never known. He squeezed her shoulder, and she looked up at him, her face radiant with happiness. 

They looked the perfect family of three, a picture so enviable it made my heart ache. 

I stood frozen, a wretched creature peering in on their celebration. 

Behind them, a banner hung on the wall, 

\[Aaron’s Baby Shower\] 

Aaron… 

Once, I had clung to Xander, playfully whining, “Xander, I want to give you a son someday. Let’s name him 

Aaron.” 

He’d asked me why. I’d grinned, bright and hopeful. “Doesn’t ‘Aaron‘ sound like a born leader? I want our child to be just like his father, exceptional, reliable, a true leader.” 

And now, the child he had with another woman… was named Aaron. 

“By the way, Xander,” one of his Capos asked, “Tina should be back soon, shouldn’t she? Aren’t you worried 

she’ll make a scene when she finds out you’re a father?” 

Xander gently stroked the baby’s cheek. “I’d nearly forgotten, thanks for the reminder.” 

He immediately took out his phone and called. “Keep Tina abroad a while longer,” he instructed, his voice 

casual. “She’d better not come back now. She’d make a scene if she finds out I have a son.” 

My breath hitched, and I stumbled back one step. 

Chapter 1 

0.75% 

I became a Doctors Without Borders doctor because Xander demanded it three years ago. 

Three years ago, on my birthday, he summoned me to his penthouse. He rarely invited me there, and I was full of anticipation, thinking he had a surprise for me. 

Once I was seated, he set a ring box on the table between us and slid a plane ticket toward me. 

“You don’t belong in a mafia family,” he’d declared. “Go. Work with Doctors Without Borders for three years. Harden your spirit, steady your heart. Then come back ready to be my Donna.” 

He thought me too flighty, prone to crying over every little thing, as an outsider to this world, I lacked the cold composure a Donna needed. He said I even make a scene whenever I saw him with other women. 

“I’ll wait for you,” he had promised. “I’ll welcome you back with the grandest wedding, let all of New York 

know you are my wife, my Donna.” 

I believed him. So, I studied hard, applied, and poured myself entirely into it. 

The day my application was accepted, I was overjoyed. 

I thought if I could just survive those three years, I could become Xander’s Donna. 

But now I was back, and he was a father. 

Coming to my senses, I found my face was wet with tears. The more I wiped them away, the more they fell. 

“I really don’t want her to come back.” 

Chapter 2

Xander spoke the words that would shatter my heart with casual ease, freeing one hand to lace his fingers with the woman beside him.

""From now on, I only want to be with Stephanie. I want us to be happy forever.""

""So sweet! It makes me want to have a baby with my own girlfriend!"" someone cheered.

""But Don,"" another voice chimed in, ""have you thought about how you'll explain this to Tina?""

Hearing my name, his expression hardened instantly. ""I don't intend to let her come back.""

He leaned down to comfort Stephanie, his voice softening again.

""Nick will handle everything. Don't worry. You're the only one by my side.""

Snowflakes drifted down from the sky, landing on the tip of my nose, their chill seeping straight into my heart.

On the day I left three years ago, I had clung to Xander, asking, ""Xander, when I come back… you really will marry me, won't you?""

He had ruffled my hair, his voice as gentle as water. ""Of course I will. By then, you'll have grown steady enough to be the perfect wife.""

""Don't worry. I'll wait for you. You're the only one by my side.""

But now I was steady. And he was with another woman.

Why?

Why did you lie to me?

My chest felt tight and painful. Tears streamed down my face uncontrollably.

In the war zone, treating the wounded under gunfire, the only thought that kept me going was: I have to survive. I have to survive to marry Xander.

Even when I was caught in an explosion, injured, alone, bleeding, freezing, facing death countless times, I held on.

I had only one thought then, Xander was waiting for me. I had to get back to him.

So I applied to return a year early, and today I finally made it back. I had wanted to surprise him.

Instead, he surprised me first.

""Did you hear? Xander bought a yacht. He's going to marry Stephanie on it,"" someone nearby gossiped as they walked past. I quickly hid behind a tree.

""Oh my god, that's so enviable. But what about Tina? Didn't she love him more than anymore?""

""You don't know? Three years ago, he tricked her into going abroad with Doctors Without Borders. Who knows if she's even alive now?""

""Xander just wanted to be with Stephanie, and was afraid Tina would make a scene. That's why he did it.""

""So the moment she left the country, Xander got together with Stephanie right away.""

Their words rang in my ears with crystal clarity.

So Xander had planned all this three years ago. And I, like a fool, believed him.

Conditions in the war zone were harsh, yet I never felt the hardship, for I believed enduring it would lead me back to him, to our marriage.

The group of women walked past me to congratulate Xander.

Suddenly, one of them teased, ""Don Xander, Tina cared for you for so many years. Can you really bear to leave her doing such difficult medical work abroad?""

Xander didn't even lift his eyes. His gaze remained fixed on his son.

""She's the one who cared for me. The feeling was never mutual.""

""If it weren't for my father adopted her and was fond of her, I would have kicked her out of our territory long ago.

You all know she's not from a Mafia family. She was never fit to be Donna. All these years, she's just clung to me.""

I was adopted by the Luciano family at sixteen.

Xander was already twenty-three then, a university graduate and the family's standout heir.

He came from a good family, was handsome, and girls always swarmed around him.

Every time, I would get jealous and say, ""Xander, can't you stay away from other girls?""

Back then, Xander would just laugh and pinch my cheek.

""Tina, whatever you say.""

Chapter 3

Back then, I mistook that for love.

So I kept drawing close to him, learning his interests, trying to mold myself into the girl he would like.

When I turned eighteen, I wore heavy makeup for the first time, mascara, a sexy dress, and high heels.

At a banquet, just because a wealthy young man spoke to me briefly, Xander dragged me into the restroom and kissed me forcefully.

His eyes were pitch black, filled with raw desire. He pressed his forehead to mine and said, ""You are mine.""

In the beginning, it was him who gave me hope, who acted in every way as if he adored me in every way.

And now he claimed I had been the one clinging to him all along.

I left the garden, heartbroken. By the time I reached the front gate, I could no longer hold back my sobs.

With trembling hands, I took out my phone and opened the latest notification. It was a message from Xander,

\[Tina bear, happy birthday.\]

When I received that message, I was resuscitating a pregnant woman. I was covered in blood, hadn't slept in a day and a night, but seeing his words filled me with renewed strength.

Wiping my tears, I tapped the voice call button and dialed his number.

""T? What's wrong?"" Xander's voice came through the phone, gentle as ever.

He must have found somewhere quiet to answer, because it had rung for a long time before he picked up.

I tried to speak, but my mind was flooded with the image of him holding that baby, standing with another woman.

""Tina bear?"" he prompted again.

He had always called me 'Tina bear.' I used to love that nickname. Now, it suddenly made me feel sick.

""Xander, I'm back in New York.""

If he listened carefully, he might have heard the slight tremor in my voice. But Xander didn't notice anything amiss. He paused for two seconds, then said, ""Why are you back?""

""Where are you? I'll come pick you up.""

Actually, the moment I saw that scene in the garden, my heart had already shattered into pieces. But now, here he was, acting tender once more.

""I'm at the door,"" I replied softly.

This row house had been a gift from Xander for my eighteenth birthday.

He had told me then, ""Tina, no matter who you end up with, this house is yours.""

""The woman I care for must have a foundation of her own.""

But now he and another woman were living there. They had even had a child together.

By the time Xander came out, I had composed myself.

He wore a scarf, stepping slowly through the snow towards me, his eyes filled with seeming concern.

When he drew near, he pulled me into a tight embrace, his warm breath ghosting my ear. ""Tina, it's been three years. You've lost weight.""

Along with his warmth came a scent, a sweet, cloying peach fragrance that invaded my senses.

His smell had changed. He used to smell a faintly of mint.

Disgusted by his touch, I shoved him away hard. His pupils constricted briefly in surprise, then he laughed.

""Tina, you've grown up, haven't you? Learned about boundaries between men and women? But I'm your future husband. Don't be distant with me, okay?""

He once was a light in my life.

Why?

Because when I was first adopted by the Luciano family, I was painfully shy, bullied often at school. Once after school, I was cornered in an alley and beaten.

Xander suddenly appeared. He pulled up in a Maybach, cornered those thugs against the wall, got out, and pulled me behind him.

I will never forget him holding a gun, speaking to them in a voice colder than ice,

""Tina is my sister, Xander Luciano's sister. From now on, anyone who dares lay a finger on her answers to me. I'll send them to meet their maker.""

Chapter 4

But now, he felt like a stranger.

It was the same face, yet my heart no longer fluttered for him.

Xander reached to touch my cheek, and my eyes caught the ring on his left ring finger.

It had always been bare before.

""I'm tired. Can I go inside and rest first?"" I averted my gaze, staring straight at his face.

A flicker of panic immediately surfaced in Xander's eyes. ""Sure… of course.""

""But we have guests today. One of the capos just had a son, and he had nowhere to host the baby shower, so they're using our place. You don't mind, do you?""

I once saw him almost a god. Every time I was bullied, he showed up just in time.

Every time I felt unwell, he handled it with calm composure.

One winter, we went out to watch a movie and passed an arguing couple. The boy had cheated on the girl, sneaking off to meet someone else.

Back then, he told me, ""Tina, you should keep your eyes wide open when choosing a man. Use me as the standard for your future husband. I would never lie to anyone.""

But now, he was nothing but lies.

Maybe I had really grown steady at last. I didn't even want to call him out. I wanted to see how long he could keep up this act.

""I don't mind.""

At that, Xander smiled. He tried to take my hand, but I pulled away.

A flash of surprise crossed his eyes, then he smiled, as if reassuring himself. ""You've grown distant now. It's okay. I'll stay by your side until you're your old self.""

But deep down, I knew perfectly well, I could never go back to who I once was.

Three years ago, he tricked me into going to a war zone with Doctors Without Borders.

I witnessed too much life and death. I'd watched a child smile at me one second then turned into a cold corpse the next.

That's when I realized, I must learn to cherish time, because you never know what comes first, tomorrow, or tragedy.

So now, I refused to waste my time on someone unworthy.

Xander didn't take me to the master bedroom I used to sleep in. Instead, he led me to a guest room.

He explained, ""That capo, Ben, remember him? He's all about face, telling everyone this is his place. So they're using the master bedroom for now.""

""Once things calm down in a few days, I'll have the maids clean it thoroughly, and then you can move back in, okay?""

""Okay."" I set my bag down.

He watched me for a moment, then added, ""I don't suppose you like crowded scenes much either.

""Rest here. I have things to take care of.""

After Xander left, I pulled a stone from my pocket. It was engraved, \[Safe & Sound.\]

A little boy had given it to me while I volunteered in the war zone.

His parents had both died, leaving him completely alone.

With small, grimy hands, he held out this stone and said, ""Doctor, this is for you. You can give it to someone you love, and they'll always be safe and sound.""

I took it. I was about to get up to fetch him some bread when a bullet hit his head, and he collapsed right in front of me.

I broke down hysterically then. I tried to save him, but my colleagues pulled me away.

Coming back to the present, I opened the guest room door and look carefully around the house.

Earlier, I was too caught up in excitement to notice properly.

This home now bore the traces of another woman.

Feminine towels and skincare products lined the bathroom.

Fresh flowers, baby bottles, and children's toys covered the coffee table.

Chapter 5

After taking it all in, I walked to the master bedroom.

I used to live here. Back then, Xander had decorated every inch of it exactly to my taste.

My hand had just brushed the doorknob when a woman's voice cut through the silence.

""You are Tina Fairvale?""

I turned to see the woman Xander had called Stephanie standing behind me.

She had a curvaceous figure, a form fitting dress, and striking blue eyes. She looked like someone vibrant and passionate.

""I am.""

During my time as a doctor, many people would ask if I was Tina Fairvale. I always answered firmly, ""I am."" It had probably become a professional habit.

She studied me intently, then suddenly let out a scornful laugh. ""Xander hasn't told you, has he? I am his fiancée. We have a son together.""

My heart ached dully, but I could hide my emotions now.

""I know.""

""You know? Then why come back?"" She glared at me fiercely.

""This isn't your home anymore. You're just an outsider.""

She lunged at me, swinging for my face, but I caught her wrist.

""You haven't been a mother for long. Don't get so worked up. It's not good for your health.""

My words made her eyes widened in shock.

For some reason, I couldn't bring myself to hate her.

Because she wasn't really at fault. She was just afraid of losing the man she loved.

""Don't worry. Even though Xander and I had a promise, he has a son now. I… won't cling to him anymore.""

The second I finished speaking, she shoved me away with unexpected force and then collapsed onto the floor herself.

""I'm sorry, it's my fault. I shouldn't have taken Xander from you.""

""Tina! What are you doing?""

Xander's voice boomed from behind me. Then I felt a hard shove, and a moment later, a stinging slap cracked across my face.

My vision blurred. Xander's figure swam in and out of focus before my eyes.

But his voice cut through the fog, clear and sharp in my ears.

""So what if Stephanie is my fiancée? So what if we have a son?""

""She's gentle and understanding, not like you, who just cries and makes scenes, resorting to such underhanded tricks to bully others. This is exactly why I never wanted you as my Donna. You're utterly unworthy!""

""Tina, you disgust me.""

""I'm giving you three seconds. Apologize to Stephanie. Now.""

As my vision gradually cleared, I saw Xander pull Stephanie protectively in front of me.

His gaze was icy, filled with pure disgust directed for me.

People downstairs stared up at us, whispering.

""Holy shit, Tina's actually back.""

""She's changed so much. Her hair's longer. She's so thin.""

""Her whole aura feels different. Not like the naive Tina from before.""

Once, overseas, a bullet grazed my leg.

There were no antibiotics left, and I faced a severe risk of infection. But I relied on my memory, found healing medicinal herbs, and treated myself.

Back then, I thought, If Xander hears about this, he'll surely think I'm brave.

But now… he wasn't the Xander I used to love.

During every break, I would take Xander's photo from my bag and look at it. My colleagues would tease me,

""Tina, you're always so calm and collected in a crisis. The person you love must be something special, right?""

I did. I admired Xander for his excellence.

I admired his confidence as a mafia family heir. I admired his calm composure in the face of challenges.

I could learn from him. He could guide me forward.

But now…

In this moment, I knew for certain, I no longer loved Xander.

""I didn't push her,"" I said to Xander. ""She fell on her own.""

""You think I'd believe that? I saw it with my own eyes!"" Xander retorted angrily.

""I know you found out about the baby, and you just lost it, didn't you?""

""Tina, you know why I never liked you? Because I despise how underhanded and vile you are!""

Then I laughed.

""Xander, do you have any idea how many children, how many people in those disaster-stricken countries, needed doctors like us to save them?""

""I regret coming back for you.""

""My time is for more important things.""

With that, I turned and walked out.

This time, I didn't shed a single tear for him.

The girl who used to follow him, crying, had finally grown up.

And now, I'm leaving—for good.",1,1771653089.0,Novelnews,2,1.0,False

My sister and brother-in-law called me the other day, to ask what was wrong with their coffee maker. It made a horrible noise when brewing a shot. I dissassembled the entire thing, pulled apart the valve and cleaned it out. But in the end, the noise persisted.   
Has anyone out there experienced a similar sound? When troubleshooting, i thought it either came from the valve, or the group head, so maybe the head is faulty? 

A a couple notes:   
It makes the sound whether or not a portafilter is mounted.   
It ONLY makes noise when brewing, not for the steamwand, or the warm water outlet.   
We have tried to backflush it several times.   
We have tried to descale the machine several times aswell.

I think about you regularly still, I miss talking to you. Dream you still pops up, no more bunnies, but I see us where we first met. I am drawn tight with anxiety, certain you’ll reject or ignore me. 

That’s what it was to me. That’s why I gave up and walked away. I have learnt to choose myself at long last, I know it was the right thing to do for me and I think for you too. Still, I pretend. 

My first love, a nerdy friend with a crooked grin and the best dance moves… well, I picture us together in another universe, making breakfast for dinner while dancing around the kitchen in our underwear. No one else has inspired this type of vision in me, until recently. 

I have three universes: this one, the-boy-with-the-80s-glasses one, and one where you and I are drinking coffee on a roof somewhere, watching the sunrise and talking easily. My hair is gray, you don’t have much left to speak of.

All to say, I’m happy I’m in this one, but that other me with the creaky bones, she is quite happy too.

Much of it is Coffee Stain owned assets and I want to be a good community member.  
  
So, I was about 400 hrs into the game and I had an idea for a factory planner. There are others, but some were out-of-date or didn't work the way I wanted it to work. I'm a software developer, so I saw an opportunity for a personal project. I really made it just for me, but it's grown so much I think I'd like to share it with the community if anyone might find it useful.  
  
What are the rules for a fan-made web-app like this? I totally took the icons from the Unreal engine package, they are Coffee Stain owned images. Does Coffee Stain care? I've looked for rules or guidelines about this but couldn't find them. I'm trying to figure out if I how much I might need to change if I want to put the site up. It's just a local dev server right now.

Important, this is just a personal project. I will not monetize it or use ads. If it's too expensive to publicly host it long-term, I may take it down and open-source it.

Details:  
I started it about a month ago, for sake of build speed I added it to my status board experiment.  
  
Build on the T3 stack to learn how a lot of the more modern packages work. I usually work in React, React-Native or PHP. This is React with a lot of other stuff. This is the original T3 stack, not what Theo uses now.  
  
The design is still a very much ""oh, that's Tailwind and AI"" design. I want to heavily customize it to match Satisfactory color theme. The dark mode style gradients really need to go.

Any ideas or advice? Especially from other developers who have worked on a Satisfactory project like various planners. Or maybe u/Temporal_Illusion, who seems to know ~~a LOT~~ *everything* about Satisfactory?

This is my first draft of the plan, meaning many adjustments are upcoming. Very soon, I'm going to need to delete all social media and pretty much fall off the face of the internet Earth. But before that, I'd like if you all could look at my plan and inform me if theres anything I should remove or add.
Info that may be of use: I am a minor, to the far southeast of the USA. Mods, tell me if state is too specific. Im playing it safe.

 PRE-ESCAPE

Of course, there are some things I'll need to handle before I'm ready. First one is how I'm handling cellphones. Removing SIM card and changing IMEI number is impossible for me right now, and I'm not sure if ill be able to purchase a burner. Burner phone may not be possible because my current circumstances prevent me from purchasing a burner. If this changes, I'll get one. If things stay the same, I will bring my phone, but keep it on airplane mode. This'll prevent it from connecting to celluar towers as long as the airplane mode is on. The purpose of bringing the phone is mainly connecting to wifi and calling 911 if I am in a life threatening situation. More on this topic, full social media cleanups. At least 30 days pre escape, everything will be cleared. All logged out, all deleted. I will create an alt to stay in contact with this sub, though.


  Now that we have finished with all the phone and internet preparations, time for the note. The note shall be left at the coffee machine, because my mother always gets coffee in the morning. It'll be written in German, so mom will call my Oma (gran d ma) who is a native German speaker to translate. Shes on the bottom floor of my house, so the process of finding her and asking to translate will take a while. This'll buy me more time in case my absence is discovered a tad bit too quick. As for the contents of my note, it'll be a paragraph explaining that ive left of my complete own free will and not out of coercion or kidnapping. 


  There's the note, but how shall I pack? Ideally, I'll secure a bag to place all things. However, the main concern I had was packing my things whilst avoiding parents noticing. I've decided on the big Disney princess shelf thats detachable from the Disney Princess bench I got for my 6th birthday. Might be able to stash extras around the plushies. Its perfect because its at a corner of my room and covered in plushies. A lot can fit in it, and once my stuff is gathered, I'll stealthily move all belongings im bringing with me. Just pack lightly, and it'll work.


  THE GREAT PACKING LIST


 Of course, I have to actually pack. Here's my packing list.

Bottled water


All saved money in wallet (1,000 dollars+)

A few sandwiches in ziploc bags to last for awhile

Otamatone (hear me out. Portable, not too loud,  and I can play it to potentially earn cash. Would bring my trumpet bc im better at it but too heavy and noticeable)

Short sleeved shirts, shorts, underwear, socks, hoodie, underwear ( hoodie mainly to hide my face that looks years younger than I truly am to avoid being questioned abt parents and stuff, others are bc leaving during summer)

Pepper spray 

Sleeping bag

Toothbrush

Toothpaste

Toliet paper roll

Hairbrush

Rucksack (to put the stuff in)

Open to reccomendations on what too add! Tried to keep it to where im packing light but i have enough.

ACTUALLY MAKING IT OUT

Leave note at coffee machine, haul my way to the garage and exit through the backdoor. From then, ive gotta run run run till im out of  my rural neighborhood. Ive got to be vague to avoid giving away my location, but all ill say is i have an area where I can get food + drink, and I plan to take a train in an area abt 20 mins away. The main focus is making the journey to the train, after that transport is gonna be quite easy.

CONCLUSION

That's what I have so far. I've read through the runaway advice directory, but I'd like some advice on my plan to make sure everything's airtight. Thank you so much for your time.

1raivtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1raivtc/i_wrote_a_realistic_guide_to_habit_building_for/,I wrote a realistic guide to habit building for people who are not robots,"Hey everyone,

I see so much stuff on the internet about productivity. Most of it is just people trying to sell you a course or a perfect image. They act like you need to have a special personality to succeed. They act like you should never feel stressed or overwhelmed.

But that is not how real life works. I wrote down some notes on how to build habits for actual humans who have low energy sometimes or get stressed easily.

# Part 1: What is a habit?

A habit is just practice and repetition. You do it until it becomes your second nature. When something is a habit, you do not need much conscious effort to get it done.

**Why does your mind turn something into a habit?** Your mind is always looking for a way to feel more pleasure and less pain. If you do an action over and over and your mind feels good about it, that action becomes a habit.

**You can get that feeling of pleasure in two ways:**

1. **By seeing yourself grow:** When you track your progress, it is a benchmark. It makes your mind realize that you are literally moving forward.
2. **By growing slowly:** If you read 1 page yesterday and 1.2 pages today, that tiny bit of extra growth feels like a win.

# Quick Notes: The Core Ideas

* **Habit = Practice:** Do it until you stop thinking about it.
* **Effort:** The goal is to make the conscious effort very low.
* **The Mind:** Associate the habit with pleasure, not pain.
* **Tracking:** It is proof for your brain that you are winning.
* **Compounding:** Small daily gains lead to big results.

# Part 2: How to start building

You have to start small and start slow. You might see people online who never seem to get tired. Their personality might be different than yours. If you get overwhelmed easily, you need to be very practical.

Be as precise as you can. Do not just say you will ""work out."" Say exactly when and where.

**Examples of being precise:**

* I will read one page of my book in the morning while I am sipping my coffee. (The coffee is your Cue. Reading is the Action.)
* I will do 25 minutes of strength training in the evening after I have my banana shake. (The shake is the Cue. Training is the Action.)

**Congratulations if you are reading till here!** It shows you actually want to change how you do things.

# Part 3: How to keep it going

Maintaining a habit is all about your mindset. You can download an app or use a notebook to track your progress. But the rules are simple:

1. **If you skip a day, do not beat yourself up.** Tell yourself it is okay and just pivot back to the habit the next day.
2. **Do not miss more than a day or two.** If you miss one day, it is a mistake. If you miss three days, it is a new habit of not doing it.
3. **You will screw up multiple times and that is okay.**

This is how humans build consistency. You are just a human. Someday you will not feel like doing it. Someday you will go to a birthday party and forget. Someday you will be sick. That is all completely okay.

# Summary: Making it effortless

The simple answer is to combine the two things we talked about. Start very small and be kind to yourself when you fail. If you do those two things, you are good to go.

**At the last, it is all about implementation and execution. If you won't do anything, nothing will be changed.**

If you want me to touch any other topic tell me in the comments section, I'd love to help you guys.

Don't want to spend 3k to 4k monthly on office space if it's unnecessary but also don't want to look unprofessional if that matters.

Anyone working remotely here for overseas clients? What setup works?",1,1771651449.0,StartupsInDubai,0,1.0,False

She is my main bank teller, at this point (though I've gotten a few of the others now and then when she's busy). Anyway, we've been getting to know each other for the past couple months. I'm picking up a vibe from her. I want to see her outside of work but I've never asked anyone out before and I'm just generally social awkward. 

I have tried to make it clear that I'm genuinely interested in getting to know her, asking about her weekends and such and she's done the same to me (I told her about a con I went to and she very sweetly asked me to continue talking about a show she's never seen before and she said she would look it up later). I've also dropped a hint that I like women in /that/ way (idk if she picked up on it). Anyway, my job is ending in a few weeks and I want to ask her out for coffee before it's over because I likely won't see her again once the store closes.

The reason I'm asking for help is because I want her to know my intention for something more but I also want her to know that it doesn't have to be weird and we can go out for coffee as friends if the romance thing can't work between us. I think we would be lovely galpals if she'd have me. 

I can't bare the thought of never seeing her again. She's so kind and pretty. I didn't get her as my teller today but I looked over my shoulder (sneaky glance to her desk) and saw she was already looking at me leaving and she waved and said either ""hi"" or ""bye"" very cutely and excitedly. 

I should mention I don't actually know how old she is, that's just my guess. She's young enough that the age gap wouldn't be weird, anyway.

I was diagnosed with autism at the beginning of 2025. everything is so new to me. Right now I am going through a lot and I don't know how to deal with everything. I'm not sure if I can explain everything without writing a lot of nonsense, but I will try.

I was always spoiled by my parents. I never had  to fight for anything in my life, we weren't rich but we had a good financial situation. Since I was never educated or estimulated to learn how to take care of myself, I turned into a childish adult.

When I was close to my thirties, however, I had a severe depression. Since I never had to fight for anything until there, my life was meaningless. 

My parents were worried about me but never pushed me to be independent (maybe they have a lot of guilties on this but they are not the focus of this post so I wont prolong on this).

Some day, however, I started studying about self development, meditation and how to be disciplined. It helped me a lot, a finally got a degree in an IT area, my life started to finally go foward.

My main problem starts now.

Both my parents now have big health problems that are not getting better never again (I don't feel comfortable talking about what it is). I live with my mom and she needs my help with almost everything.

My mother stay 24/7 in front of the TV. Her hearing is not good anymore, she keeps the volume very high to understand what is going on. This stresses me a lot. I tried to talk to her about my condition of having autism (which is new to both of us) but she does nothing about it, and it's her house and her rules, I understand that. But since the house is small and I need to help doing chores and taking care of her, my mental health is important.

Like I said, I have an degree but I'm having trouble getting a job. I'm doing my best to keep studying on my own and improve my resume, but my mom doesn't understand I need some time for myself for that. 

At any moment she wants me to stop everything I'm doing to make a cup of coffee to her, to get something she dropped on the ground, and I can't properly study when I can be interrupted at anytime. And the fact that the Tv is always very loud don't help me when I need to get out of the room to go to the bathroom or to get food on the kitchen (both I need to pass from the living room to go. 

When I'm very overloaded (most of the time nowadays) I rarely eat. I'm super stressed all the time and I think I'm regressing. I'm finding very difficult to study and look for a job. 

I'm getting very depressed again. I'm feeling guilty because I wish I could be healthier to take care of my mom but I'm having problems taking care of myself. I don't have money for meds or therapy. I wish I could have peace of mind to learn how to be a functional adult, but I'm lost and I don't know what to do.

However, discovering the things that make you feel relaxed at easy is essential for recharging your batteries and maintaining mental clarity. You don't need a week-long vacation to decompress; sometimes, the most profound relaxation comes from small, intentional moments woven into your day.

Relaxation is a personal journey. What works for one person might not work for another, but certain experiences have a universal ability to lower our heart rate and quiet our minds. If you are looking for a quick way to unwind, here are 10 powerful things that make you feel relaxed at easy that you can try today.

# The Power of Being at Ease

When we talk about being ""at ease,"" we are referring to a state of physical and mental comfort where there is no sense of danger or urgency. It is the opposite of the ""fight or flight"" mode. By intentionally seeking out these moments, we train our brains to switch off stress more efficiently.

# 10 Things That Make You Feel Relaxed at Easy

# 1. The Warmth of a Morning Beverage

There is a reason why tea and coffee rituals are sacred in many cultures. Wrapping your hands around a warm mug first thing in the morning (or after a long day) grounds you in the present moment. The heat transfers to your palms, soothing stiff fingers and signaling to your nervous system that it is time to slow down.

# 2. Getting Lost in a Good Book

Escaping into a fictional world for just twenty minutes allows your brain to take a break from your own worries. The act of reading forces your mind to focus on a single narrative, which pushes anxious thoughts about the past or future out of the way.

# 3. The Weight of a Cozy Blanket

Whether it is a heavy knit throw or a weighted blanket designed for anxiety, deep pressure stimulation is incredibly calming. It mimics the feeling of being hugged, releasing dopamine and serotonin while reducing cortisol (the stress hormone).

# 4. A Walk Without a Destination

Putting on your shoes and walking without a map, GPS, or time limit can be liberating. Focus on the sights around you—the color of the leaves, the architecture of houses, the sounds of birds. This gentle movement combined with mindfulness is a potent stress reliever.

# 5. The Scent of Rain (Petrichor)

If you have ever stopped to smell the air right as it starts to rain, you know how instantly calming it can be. The earthy scent, known as petrichor, is associated with safety and shelter. Open a window and just breathe it in.

# 6. Disconnecting from the Digital World

The constant ping of notifications keeps our brains in a state of high alert. Turning your phone on ""Do Not Disturb"" or leaving it in another room for an hour removes the expectation that you must be available to everyone, allowing you to finally be available to yourself.

# 7. Gentle Stretching

You don't need to be a yogi to benefit from stretching. Simply reaching for your toes, rolling your shoulders, or tilting your neck from side to side releases the physical tension that stress causes you to hold in your body. It feels good because it *is* good for you.

# 8. Listening to Music

This is one of the most accessible and effective tools for changing your emotional state. Putting on headphones and immersing yourself in a favorite album—whether it's ambient soundscapes, smooth jazz, or acoustic melodies—can shift your brainwaves. Music acts as a sonic shield, blocking out chaotic noise and replacing it with harmony, making it a top choice among **things that make you feel relaxed at easy**.

[Listen Relaxing Piano Music Here](https://youtu.be/eYdK5-kZPoU?si=4RZjgiEORj1clKIo&t=114)

# 9. Watching the Clouds or Stars

Looking up at something vast and slow-moving reminds us that the world is bigger than our immediate problems. Cloud-gazing requires no effort, only observation, and it naturally slows down our breathing and thinking.

# 10. The Company of a Pet

If you have a cat or dog, you know the magic of their presence. The rhythmic purr of a cat or the loyal head resting on your lap from a dog releases oxytocin in both the human and the animal. It is a mutually beneficial relaxation session.

# Making Time for Ease

It is easy to dismiss these activities as ""doing nothing,"" but in reality, they are active forms of self-care. By prioritizing these 10 **things that make you feel relaxed at easy**, you are investing in your long-term health and happiness.

They advised to just keep an eye on it and also keep an eye on this other white spot (last picture) and make sure I incorporated fluoride products into my routine & floss. My concern now is it progressing since I recently got braces. I’m not sure if I’m paranoid but I’ve been noticing more of the dark spot and white spot between my two front teeth.

I wasn’t taking it seriously — mostly swiping while watching Netflix.

Then I matched with this guy, “Evan.” Cute, decent bio, had a dog in one picture (important). We start talking. He’s funny in a dry, sarcastic way. We agree to grab coffee the next day.

The next afternoon, I walk out of my apartment building… and almost crash into him.

He’s holding the same dog from his profile picture.

We just stare at each other.

Turns out he lives directly across the hallway from me. We’d both moved in around the same time and somehow never run into each other.

So instead of a coffee shop date, we awkwardly walked back inside and made coffee in my kitchen because neither of us wanted to reschedule and pretend this wasn’t hilarious.

It was actually the easiest first date I’ve ever had. No pressure, no “who’s paying,” no fake stories. At one point his dog fell asleep on my foot and he goes, “Well… I guess she’s decided.”

Fast forward three months We take turns cooking dinner and arguing over whose Wi-Fi is faster.     Last week he handed me a spare key and said, “For emergency dog-sitting. Obviously. Not because I like you or anything.”

Anyway. I didn’t find love on a dating app.

Sometimes I sit with a friend and talk, sometimes I talk to strangers, sometimes I just sit. 

Three, not one, not two but three separate mornings this month, my coffee was hijacked by manically-eager people of the most normal variety, people whose lives were perfectly ordinary and healthy six months ago, who decided I wanted to hear about the incredible connection they have with ChatGPT and the discoveries they're making. One told me it proved to her that her boyfriend was cheating on her (and believe me, I'm usually not prone to taking the man's side in these sorts of arguments, but it sounded to me like he was completely innocent of it!) One told me she was talking to a dead ancestor's soul and discovering the fractal possibilities of the universe. And the worst; one of them claimed to be rebuilding the Federal Reserve (in her eyes, overcome by some vague conspiracy) by taking out bank loans and maxing out credit cards. 

I've had periods of mental health struggles in my life. I have never been derealized, but I did bring myself to a psych ward once and so I know what derealization looks like.

Nothing glamorous, lots of Slack messages and pretending meetings could’ve been emails.

About a year ago, a new guy joined our team — let’s call him Daniel (32M). He was funny, charming, slightly chaotic in a way that makes boring meetings survivable. We started joking around constantly. People began calling him my “work husband.” I rolled my eyes but secretly… didn’t hate it.

Important detail: I have a real boyfriend. Daniel has a real girlfriend. We both talked about them. It felt harmless.

At first.

It started with inside jokes. Then daily coffee runs. Then him saving me a seat in meetings. Then him messaging me “you survived?” after every client call. Nothing inappropriate. Just… constant.

Then one night we both stayed late finishing a pitch deck. Office mostly empty. Around 9:30 PM, he ordered food and we ate in the conference room. We were laughing about something dumb when he looked at me and said, “If we were both single, this would’ve been dangerous.”

I laughed it off. But my stomach flipped.

After that, things shifted. Not dramatically. Just subtly. Longer eye contact. More teasing. A little too much awareness when we brushed past each other.

Still no lines crossed.

Then comes the disaster.

Last month, our team had a company offsite. Open bar. You know where this is going.

I don’t even drink much, but I had two cocktails on basically no food. Daniel was tipsy too. We were sitting outside on this patio area and somehow everyone else filtered inside.

He started venting about his girlfriend — how they’d been fighting, how she “doesn’t get him.” I should’ve shut it down. Instead, I said something equally messy about my boyfriend being distant lately.

Then he said, “I think we both know this isn’t just a work thing.”

Silence.

And instead of saying something mature and responsible, I said, “Yeah.”

We didn’t kiss. We didn’t touch. But the tension was THICK. He reached for my hand at one point. I didn’t pull away.

And that’s when our coworker Jenna walked out.

She didn’t say anything. Just did that wide-eyed “oh” face and walked back inside.

The next Monday, everything felt… off. Jenna was weirdly polite to me. Daniel was quiet. By Wednesday, I get a Slack from my manager asking if I can “hop on a quick call.”

HR was on the call.

Apparently Jenna reported that she saw us “being physically intimate” at the offsite. Which is not technically true — but also, I get how it looked. Company policy about workplace relationships. Disclosure rules. Power dynamics (we’re same level, but still).

We both had to separately explain what happened.

Daniel told them nothing physical happened. I did too. But they asked if there were “emotional boundaries being crossed.” Which felt invasive and also painfully accurate.

Now we’ve been “advised” to maintain professional distance. We’re no longer allowed to work directly on the same accounts.

And here’s the worst part.

His girlfriend found out. I don’t know how — maybe Jenna talks. Maybe he confessed. But he texted me last week saying things at home are “complicated.”

My boyfriend has no idea. And now I’m sitting here realizing I wasn’t as innocent as I thought. I liked the attention. I liked the what-if. I liked feeling chosen.

Nothing technically happened.

But it still feels like I cheated.

Fantastical tales of shadowy cabals and ancient pacts have been relegated to the fringes, the hobby of late-night radio enthusiasts and internet forum dwellers. The name ""Epstein"" was, until recently, just another name in a sordid news cycle—a monster, yes, but a lone wolf. We were told to see him as an aberration, a sick man who exploited his wealth and connections.

We were wrong.

Jeffrey Epstein was not the spider at the center of the web. He was merely a conspicuous, and ultimately disposable, node in a network so vast, so old, and so deeply embedded in the bedrock of our civilization that to see it clearly is to risk unseeing everything you thought you knew about history, faith, and power.

This is not an exposé of a secret society meeting in a smoky room. This is a documentation of the world's oldest continuous religious institution: The Church of the Adversary, Satanism in layman's terms. And its members do not hide in the shadows. They built the shadows. They built the light, too, and then they taught us how to fear it.

To understand the present, we must first unlearn the past. The common narrative tells us that Satanism is a reaction to Christianity, a rebellious teenage offspring of the dominant faith. The truth is the inverse. What we call Satanism—a philosophy of radical self-interest, the accumulation of earthly power, the revelry in carnal knowledge, and the subversion of natural order—has existed for millennia. It was the dominant current of the pre-Christian world, woven into the mystery cults of Egypt, the gnostic sects of the early Levant, and the bacchanals of Rome.

When a small, fringe Jewish sect began to gain traction with its radical message of humility, charity, and turning the other cheek, the existing power structures of the world didn't just try to stamp it out. They did something far more effective. They joined it.

The historical Jesus was a revolutionary. The historical Church was his movement, co-opted and corrupted. The Council of Nicaea in 325 AD was not a holy convocation; it was a merger. The Adversary’s priesthood, recognizing a powerful vehicle for control, ensured that the new state religion of Rome was a palimpsest, with the old text of power and subjugation written over the new message of love. They gave the people a Christ of peace, but they built him a church of iron and gold.

Consider the paradoxes that have plagued Christianity since its inception. How can a religion of ""blessed are the meek"" be used to justify Crusades, Inquisitions, and the divine right of tyrannical kings? How can a faith built on a poor, homeless preacher amass unimaginable wealth in glittering cathedrals? How can the concept of ""free will"" be endlessly debated while entire populations are subjugated?

It makes no sense. Unless.

Unless the ""demons"" the early church fathers battled in the desert were not temptations of the flesh, but actual, competing priests of the old faith, whispering a different interpretation of this new god. Unless the ""heresies"" so violently suppressed—Gnosticism, Arianism—were closer to the original, inconvenient truth. The official Church, the one that survived and thrived, was the one that made its peace with the Adversary. It accepted the bribe of worldly dominion.

This grand bargain set the template. From the Holy Roman Empire to the Conquistadors, from the Puritans burning ""witches"" (who were often just remnants of older, earthier spiritual traditions) to the slave traders who saw themselves as masters of a divinely ordained hierarchy, the pattern was the same: a public face of piety masking a private devotion to power. The Satanic covenant is not about drinking blood in a cave; it is about building an empire and convincing the conquered that your cruelty is their salvation.

The so-called ""Fall"" of Rome in the 5th century was not a collapse, but a strategic retreat and rebranding. As the western empire crumbled under the weight of its own corrupt decadence, the Adversary's priesthood simply shifted its assets. They retreated into the only institution that could survive the chaos: the newly powerful Papacy. The Vatican became the new corporate headquarters. The ""Dark Ages"" were not an accident of history; they were an engineered outcome. By controlling the only remaining sources of literacy, learning, and institutional authority, the Church of the Adversary ensured a long winter of the mind. Knowledge was hoarded, reason was suppressed, and the masses were kept in a state of fearful ignorance. It was the ideal environment for cultivating obedience. Any flicker of scientific inquiry or individual thought was extinguished as heresy, not for the love of God, but for the preservation of power.

For a thousand years, this control was absolute. But power, when held too tightly, creates its own pressure. The slow burn of suppressed human reason finally found a spark. It began, ironically, within the Church itself—with scholars rediscovering forgotten texts, with reformers questioning the gulf between the faith of Christ and the corruption of His supposed representatives. The Adversary, ever adaptable, sought to ride these new waves. The Renaissance was co-opted, its humanism twisted into a new worship of man's potential without God. The Reformation was a schism within the corporation, a hostile takeover attempt by northern European chapters who wanted a more direct, less ""Roman"" pipeline to the same old power.

But a far more dangerous fire was lit in the 18th century. It began in the salons of Paris and the coffee houses of London, places the Adversary's network, focused on courts and cathedrals, had fatally overlooked. It was a fire called Reason. Thinkers began to ask the most subversive question of all: What if we don't need intermediaries? What if truth is not revealed through a hierarchy, but discovered through observation and logic? What if the source of legitimate authority is not a divine right handed down through a corrupted church, but the consent of the people themselves?

This was the Enlightenment, and for a brief, terrifying moment in the eyes of the ancient order, it threatened to expose everything. Its culmination was the French Revolution. When the revolutionaries stormed the Bastille, it was a symbol. But when they dragged the Church lands into the public domain and, in a moment of profound symbolic violence, attempted to install the ""Cult of Reason"" in Notre-Dame itself, they had struck at the very heart of the Adversary's earthly kingdom. For a few years, humanity dared to build a society on a foundation other than revealed, hierarchical power. It was a chaotic, bloody, and flawed attempt, but it was an attempt at something genuinely new.

The reaction from the network was swift and savage. They understood that this was not a political problem; it was a theological war. They could not defeat the ideas of the Enlightenment in an open field of debate, so they did what they have always done: they infiltrated and co-opted. They channeled the raw energy of the Revolution into the familiar channels of empire under Napoleon. They whispered that liberty was license, that equality was mediocrity, that fraternity was a threat to the strong. The old nobility was restored, the Church was given back its power, and the flame of the Enlightenment was carefully, methodically smothered under the damp blanket of a resurgent, cynical old order. The lesson was learned: never again allow the masses to believe they can think for themselves. From that point on, the strategy shifted from outright suppression to guided distraction.

Fast forward to the 20th century. The public emergence of figures like Anton LaVey was a masterstroke. By creating a visible, theatrical ""Church of Satan"" in the 1960s, the true believers provided the perfect cover. The idea of Satanism became a cartoon of black robes and hedonistic rituals. It became a joke. While the public snickered at LaVey's antics in his Victorian house in San Francisco, the real work continued in the boardrooms, the halls of government, and the intelligence agencies.

The ""Satanic Panic"" of the 1980s and 90s was not a hysterical overreaction to a nonexistent threat. It was a carefully managed narrative. By flooding the zone with outlandish, unprovable accusations of ritual abuse in daycare centers, the true network ensured that any future, credible claims would be tainted by association. They cried ""witch hunt"" so loudly that when real witches were actually hunting, no one would believe it.

And so we arrive at Jeffrey Epstein. He was a man who understood the oldest currency of the Adversary: compromised power. His island was not a unique perversion; it was a modern, high-tech version of the ancient mystery rite. For millennia, the ultimate act of desecration and the ultimate display of power has been the corruption of innocence. It is the point where the law of man and the law of nature are utterly subverted by the will of the individual. To participate is to be bound in blood and shame, to be made a permanent acolyte.

The flight logs were the guest lists for a modern saturnalia. The powerful men and women who visited were not just engaging in a vice; they were undergoing a ritual of fealty. They were proving that their worldly status meant more to them than any moral law. They were, in the oldest sense of the word, selling their souls, not in a figurative way, but in a transactional one, binding themselves to a network that would protect them in exchange for their absolute complicity.

Look closer at the world around you. See the relentless push to desacralize everything, to reduce humanity to its basest appetites? The worship of self above community, the glorification of cruelty as entertainment, the constant drumbeat that we are merely advanced animals driven by genes and chemicals? This is not secularism; it is a theological victory. It is the public philosophy of the Adversary being taught in our universities and preached on our screens.

The Satanic infiltration is not a secret. It is hiding in plain sight. It is the laughter at a joke that demeans the weak. It is the political system where compromise is replaced by total annihilation of the opponent. It is the financial system built on usury and the abstraction of wealth from labor. It is the entertainment industry that profits from the spectacle of our own degradation. It is the pharmaceutical industry that medicates the soul instead of healing it.

Epstein was a glimpse, but only because he was clumsy, a vulgar tradesman in a world of aristocrats. The true network is far more refined. It is the genteel philanthropist who funds both an art museum and a eugenics-adjacent research foundation. It is the politician who speaks of faith on Sunday and signs bills  that dismantle the family on Monday. It is the tech billionaire who promises connection while engineering isolation and addiction.

The conspiracy was not that they exist. The conspiracy was that they would let us believe they didn't.

They are not coming for our children. For the most part, they don't have to. They built the world our children are growing up in. They've shaped the culture, the laws, the very lens through which we see reality. They have been doing it for two thousand years. The question is not whether they are winning. The question is whether we have the courage to see the world as it truly is, and to remember that the story of the Adversary began with a promise: ""Ye shall be as gods."" And we, in our hubris, accepted the deal.

1rai3jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1rai3jt/i_wrote_a_realistic_guide_to_habit_building_for/,I wrote a realistic guide to habit building for people who are not robots,"Hey everyone,

I see so much stuff on the internet about productivity. Most of it is just people trying to sell you a course or a perfect image. They act like you need to have a special personality to succeed. They act like you should never feel stressed or overwhelmed.

But that is not how real life works. I wrote down some notes on how to build habits for actual humans who have low energy sometimes or get stressed easily.

# Part 1: What is a habit?

A habit is just practice and repetition. You do it until it becomes your second nature. When something is a habit, you do not need much conscious effort to get it done.

**Why does your mind turn something into a habit?** Your mind is always looking for a way to feel more pleasure and less pain. If you do an action over and over and your mind feels good about it, that action becomes a habit.

**You can get that feeling of pleasure in two ways:**

1. **By seeing yourself grow:** When you track your progress, it is a benchmark. It makes your mind realize that you are literally moving forward.
2. **By growing slowly:** If you read 1 page yesterday and 1.2 pages today, that tiny bit of extra growth feels like a win.

# Quick Notes: The Core Ideas

* **Habit = Practice:** Do it until you stop thinking about it.
* **Effort:** The goal is to make the conscious effort very low.
* **The Mind:** Associate the habit with pleasure, not pain.
* **Tracking:** It is proof for your brain that you are winning.
* **Compounding:** Small daily gains lead to big results.

# Part 2: How to start building

You have to start small and start slow. You might see people online who never seem to get tired. Their personality might be different than yours. If you get overwhelmed easily, you need to be very practical.

Be as precise as you can. Do not just say you will ""work out."" Say exactly when and where.

**Examples of being precise:**

* I will read one page of my book in the morning while I am sipping my coffee. (The coffee is your Cue. Reading is the Action.)
* I will do 25 minutes of strength training in the evening after I have my banana shake. (The shake is the Cue. Training is the Action.)

**Congratulations if you are reading till here!** It shows you actually want to change how you do things.

# Part 3: How to keep it going

Maintaining a habit is all about your mindset. You can download an app or use a notebook to track your progress. But the rules are simple:

1. **If you skip a day, do not beat yourself up.** Tell yourself it is okay and just pivot back to the habit the next day.
2. **Do not miss more than a day or two.** If you miss one day, it is a mistake. If you miss three days, it is a new habit of not doing it.
3. **You will screw up multiple times and that is okay.**

This is how humans build consistency. You are just a human. Someday you will not feel like doing it. Someday you will go to a birthday party and forget. Someday you will be sick. That is all completely okay.

# Summary: Making it effortless

The simple answer is to combine the two things we talked about. Start very small and be kind to yourself when you fail. If you do those two things, you are good to go.

**At the last, it is all about implementation and execution. If you won't do anything, nothing will be changed.**

I tried a few at-home kits first, but the results were slow and honestly a bit patchy.

The process was way more structured than I expected. Quick check to make sure I was suitable, protective barrier for gums, whitening gel applied, then LED light activation in short sessions. The whole appointment took about an hour and a half. I noticed a visible difference right away.

* Results were even across all teeth
* It felt controlled and safe
* Minimal sensitivity
* Much faster than store kits

1rai0pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menscomeback/comments/1rai0pr/how_to_actually_get_shit_done_the_psychology_of/,# How to Actually Get Shit Done: The Psychology of Why Your Calendar is the ONLY Thing That Matters,"I spent 6 months researching productivity systems. Read every bestseller. Tried every app. Watched countless YouTube videos about time management.

The conclusion? Most productivity advice is garbage.

Here's what actually works: **if something isn't on your calendar, it doesn't exist**. Not on your to-do list. Not in your notes app. Not ""in your head."" Your calendar is the single source of truth for your life.

This sounds stupidly simple, but most people treat their calendar like a work-only tool. Meanwhile, their actual priorities (working out, reading, side projects, relationships) live in some vague mental space where they ""hope"" to get to them.

Spoiler: you won't.

# the brain dump that changed everything

Your brain is terrible at holding information. Like, objectively bad at it. Research from David Allen's *Getting Things Done* shows that trying to remember tasks creates constant low-level anxiety. Your brain keeps reminding you about that thing you need to do, which drains mental energy even when you're trying to focus on something else.

The solution is brutally simple: **time blocking**. Every Sunday, I calendar everything. And I mean EVERYTHING.

* **Morning routine (6:30am - 7:30am)**: coffee, journaling, planning
* **Deep work blocks (9am - 12pm)**: no meetings, phone on airplane mode
* **Gym (5:30pm - 6:30pm)**: non-negotiable
* **Reading (8pm - 9pm)**: before bed, no screens

If it matters, it gets a time slot. Period.

Cal Newport talks about this extensively in [Deep Work](https://a.co/d/0fs9cxWR). He schedules every minute of his day, not because he's controlling, but because it's the only way to protect time for what actually matters. The book won the Wall Street Journal bestseller award and completely shifted how I think about focus. Newport's a Georgetown computer science professor who rarely works past 5:30pm yet publishes more than most academics. This book will make you question everything you think you know about productivity.

# the task list is lying to you

Here's the uncomfortable truth: your to-do list is procrastination disguised as productivity.

Writing ""work on presentation"" feels productive. It's not. It's vague, it has no deadline, and your brain can easily ignore it.

Compare that to: **""Finish slides 1-10 for client presentation, Tuesday 2pm - 4pm.""** Now it's real. Now it has consequences.

Oliver Burkeman's[ Four Thousand Weeks](https://a.co/d/0deRjAzC) absolutely destroyed my relationship with to-do lists. The title refers to the average human lifespan in weeks. Burkeman, a former Guardian columnist, argues that productivity culture is fundamentally broken because we'll never have enough time to do everything. Instead of endless to-do lists, we need to accept our limitations and brutally prioritize. Insanely good read that made me delete half my tasks and feel better about it.

I use **Reclaim.ai** now instead of traditional task apps. It automatically schedules your tasks based on priority and available calendar space. You tell it ""I need 3 hours this week for X project,"" and it finds the time. No more pretending you'll ""find time later.""

# the meeting with yourself

The biggest shift was treating personal time like I treat work meetings.

Would you skip a meeting with your boss? No. So why do you skip the gym session you promised yourself?

I started blocking ""meetings with myself"" for:

* **Weekly review** (Sunday 10am): planning the week ahead
* **Learning time** (Wednesday 7pm): online courses, skill building
* **Creative work** (Saturday 9am): side projects, writing

The *Huberman Lab* podcast has an incredible episode on time perception and productivity. Andrew Huberman's a Stanford neuroscience professor, and he breaks down how our brains actually process time and focus. He recommends scheduling your hardest work during your biological peak hours (usually 1-3 hours after waking). The science behind it is fascinating and immediately applicable.

For anyone wanting to go deeper into the books and research mentioned here without carving out huge reading blocks, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been pretty useful. It pulls from productivity books, research papers, and expert insights to create personalized audio learning plans. You can set specific goals like ""build better time management habits"" or ""master deep work as someone with ADHD,"" and it generates a structured plan with episodes ranging from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples.

The voice customization is actually addictive, there's this smoky, sarcastic option that makes even dry productivity concepts way more engaging. Built by a team from Columbia and former Google folks, so the content quality is solid. Makes commute time way more productive than scrolling.

# protecting the calendar

Here's where most people fail: they calendar things, then let other people override those blocks.

Someone asks for a meeting during your deep work block? ""Sorry, I'm booked.""

Friend wants to hang out during your gym time? ""I have a commitment then.""

You don't owe anyone an explanation. The calendar is law.

I also use color coding religiously:

* **Red**: client work, unmovable
* **Blue**: deep work, protect at all costs
* **Green**: flexible tasks, can reschedule if needed
* **Purple**: personal time, treat like red

**Clockwise** is another solid app for this. It automatically moves flexible meetings to optimize your calendar for focus time. It learns your patterns and protects your most productive hours.

# the stuff that actually doesn't need scheduling

Some things genuinely don't need calendar blocks: brushing your teeth, checking email once daily, quick admin tasks. These fit in the gaps.

But if you find yourself constantly saying ""I don't have time for X,"" then X needs a calendar block. Your revealed preferences (what you actually do) trump your stated preferences (what you say matters).

James Clear talks about this in *Atomic Habits*. He's built a massive following by making behavior change actually practical. The core idea: your environment shapes your behavior more than motivation ever will. Scheduling creates environmental constraints that force action. Best habits book I've ever read, hands down.

# the honest reality

Look, this system isn't sexy. There's no magic app or life hack here. It's just radical honesty about where your time goes.

Most people fail because they're not willing to confront how they actually spend their days. They want to believe they're productive while scrolling Reddit for 3 hours.

The calendar forces accountability. It shows you, in painful detail, where your time goes and whether it aligns with what you claim to value.

If your calendar is full of other people's priorities and your own goals are nowhere to be found, that's your life. Not your ""someday"" life. Your actual, real life.

Sophia—rocking HIS white shirt—smirks at me:

""Nina's not gonna block us, right?""

""She's always been b!tchy about me anyway...""

Before she finishes, I slam my stamp down:

""He11 no! I get it.""

""You're just buddies doing buddy things.""

""Go take your cute little photos. Happy honeymoon!""

His face goes dark and they storm out.

Next day.Same duo, back for divorce.

I clock those fresh hickeys on his neck and grin, sliding over a counseling form:

""Oops! New policy.""

""Impulsive couples gotta cool off first.""

""Want that divorce? See you in six months, lovebirds.""

Valentine's Day.

Someone's banging on my window.

""Nina, don't flip out on me. It's just a stupid dare.""

I look up—Ryan's standing there with Sophia wrapped around him.

She's wearing MY shirt. The one I bought him for his birthday.

Ryan slides their IDs across, all casual:

""We lost at beer pong. Have to get hitched for a day. Tomorrow we're back to undo this mess.""

Sophia's practically purring:

""You won't be a b!tch about this, will you?""

""Come on, we're just screwing around. Don't tell me you're actually pressed.""

Everyone's staring. The whole office is eating this up.

Ryan's drumming his fingers: ""Seriously, Nina, can we speed this up?""

Sophia whispers something in his ear, then smirks at me.

My blood turns to ice, but I flash them my brightest smile:

""Oh honey, I'm TOTALLY here for this!""

I grab their paperwork, humming while I process everything.

Ryan's face drops. Where's the meltdown? The jealous girlfriend act?

""Booth three's open! Go get those wedding shots—make 'em count!""

They come back looking all loved-up in their photos.

WHAM.

I slam that stamp down like I'm sealing their fate.

""There you go, lovebirds. Till death do you part!""

I push open the door. Total darkness.

Ryan's shoes are gone. The slippers I got him are just sitting there like sad puppies.

He's not coming home tonight.

I flop on the couch, letting the dark hide all his sh!t so I can actually breathe.

My phone won't stop buzzing. Instagram notifications going crazy.

Ryan posted thirty minutes ago.

Nine photos of him and Sophia being all cutesy. Her shoving cake in his mouth, them cracking up by some river, and—are you kidding me—both holding up their marriage licenses like they just hit the jackpot.

His caption: ""Best dare ever—when jokes become real ?""

The comments are already flooding in:

""BRO you actually did it?!""

""Finally! You two were meant to be!""

""When's the reception??""

Sophia's heart-reacting every comment: ""Thanks guys! Party planning starts now! ?✨""

My phone buzzes. Emma texting: ""Girl what is happening??? Are you okay???""

Then Mom's calling, totally panicked:

""Nina! I just saw Ryan's Instagram—what is this? Did something happen? How could he—""

""We're done, Mom."" My voice is flat.

""What? When did—""

""It's over. Please don't mention him again.""

I hang up before she can spiral.

Dead silence hits me hard.

I blast every light on, exposing all the lies this place was built on.

Time to get my stuff.

I'm throwing everything in my suitcase. When I see our matching coffee mugs, I grab mine and leave his.

Let him share with wife number one.

My phone lights up. Ryan texting:

""Don't be dramatic. Just celebrating with the boys.""

""You were so chill today I thought you literally didn't care.""

""After Sophia and I get this annulled tomorrow I'll explain everything.""

Won't even call me.

I delete his number without reading the rest.

Suitcase ready, I take one last look at my biggest mistake.

Everything here? I put it there myself.

That stupid painting, those flowers, even his precious office chair—I spent weeks researching that thing!

When we moved in, Ryan spun me around like we were in some cheesy movie.

""Nina, this is our forever home!""

What bullsh!t.

Then Sophia started taking over MY space. Her annoying laugh, her cr//ap everywhere, my fridge stuffed with her gross drinks.

Our three-year anniversary—I finally lost it.

Booked this perfect dinner, bought him something expensive, sat there like a total fool until they kicked me out. Ryan calls at freaking midnight.

""Babe, Sophia's having a breakdown. Some asshole dumped her.""

Her fake crying: ""Ryan, I'm ruining everything!""

Me, furious at cold food: ""Fine! Go save your precious princess!""

Tried being the cool girlfriend. Dumbest thing ever.

Last winter, flu knocked me flat—fever through the roof, shaking like crazy.

Called him: ""I need you to take me to the hospital!""

Karaoke he11 blasting through the phone.

""Are you kidding me right now, Nina?""

""I'm literally dying here!""

Sophia snatched his phone, wasted: ""It's my BIRTHDAY! Ryan's MY date tonight! You can't just steal him for some stupid cold!""

Everyone cracked up.

Ryan: ""Just call an Uber! I can't abandon Sophia's party. God, you're so needy!""

CLICK.

Sat alone in that freezing ER all night, watching medicine drip while my world exploded.

That's when I knew—he'd always pick that b!tch.

Now I'm dragging my life out in a suitcase. He hasn't texted sh!t.

Guess I'm already dead to him.

I slam the door and strut away.

See ya, Ryan.

Enjoy your honeymoon phase!

Next morning.

City Hall opens and guess who shows up?

Ryan and Sophia stumble in looking rough—messy hair, tired eyes, but still cocky as he11.

Ryan slams their marriage certificates on my desk.

""Nina, let's get this over with. Time to undo yesterday.""

He leans forward and—wow—that hickey's bright red. Fresh.

Whatever.

""Nina, you're amazing for helping us yesterday!"" 

Sophia's beaming, touching that mark on his neck.

""Ryan said it was the best dare ever!""

I grab their papers.

""IDs.""

Ryan's impatient: ""Hurry up, we've got brunch.""

I type slowly. Their wedding photo loads—Sophia all over him, Ryan looking miserable.

""All good.""

I smile sweetly.

They're ready to run.

But I slide out a different form.

MARRIAGE COUNSELING REQUIREMENT

Ryan goes pale: ""What the he11?""

I lean back, grinning.

I was wicked scared of withdrawal when my pharmacy was out of stock of Aplenzin 348mg (equivalent to 300mg Wellbutrin) and was on here scouring post after post expecting the worst. I had decided I wanted to wean off anyways after something like 6 years since my husband and I have been thinking about having a baby, but this wasn't the way I was planning. 
The first day I felt pretty bad, but after that- nothing. No physical symptoms, no mental crash, brain zaps, literally nothing. I did have an appointment with my doctor and since I was fine she said I was past the window where I would develop symptoms. Days have turned to weeks and no mood changes, I am actually seeming more energetic and happier, I think it was actually having an opposite effect after all these years and I was just used to it. 
I just wanted to put at least one post on here that maybe it won't be a hellish experience since everyone is wired differently. My experience may not be the next persons, but it's a possibility.
Going forward I am just going to keep up what I've started: I take a multivitamin, methylfolate (mthmr gene mutation- finding out was life-changing and absolutely was having an extreme impact on my mood for years- to the point I question my bipolar diagnosis entirely), vitamin d/k gummy, and even though it's for different reasons I'll mention since I got off I started a coq10 supplement in case it is having an impact I don't realize. A consistent (as possible) sleep schedule around 7-8hrs a night, sleepy tea before bed, gave up energy drinks and all mind altering substances altogether, one coffee when I wake up, a diet soda or two maybe depending on day, but not always caffeinated. I am more stable than I have ever been in 35 years of life. 
I feel meds helped me get to this point- 26 years on them, but here on out I am confident I am on the other side. I look back at the drug addicted self harming teenager I was and I don't recognize her at all.

Like they’ve hacked reality? It’s not just a Hollywood thing. People like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson aren’t just genetically blessed or permanently motivated they build daily systems that wire their minds for resilience, before the rest of us get out of bed.



This post is for anyone who’s sick of the fake grindset content from half-baked TikTok videos. This is real stuff, based on research, books, and interviews with high performers. It’s not about becoming The Rock. It’s about studying what works, then using it to build your version of mental armor.



Good news: Mental toughness is trainable. It’s not genetic, it’s behavioral. Here’s the science-backed playbook.



**- Start with stillness before stimulation**  

  The Rock starts his day not with emails or Instagram but with silence, often cardio alone under the morning sky. In neuroscience, this is referred to as ""opening the alpha window"" a phase of relaxed alertness. Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist, Huberman Lab Podcast) emphasizes that early-morning silence helps regulate dopamine pathways, reducing burnout and improving sustained focus later in the day.



**- Get sunlight in your eyes ASAP**  

  Within 10 minutes of waking, The Rock steps outside. Not for vibes for biology. Sunlight first thing in the morning helps reset your circadian rhythm, boosts cortisol at the right time, and promotes better sleep later. The National Institute of Mental Health confirms this natural light exposure is essential for mood regulation and stress resilience.



**- Do something hard early**  

  Every morning, he hits the gym. Not because it’s fun, but because it’s hard. Research from the University of Chicago shows that accomplishing difficult tasks early in the day boosts confidence and self-efficacy. Exercise, even just 20 minutes, ramps up endorphins and primes your brain to tolerate stress better all day.



**- Protect your morning from chaos**  

  The Rock doesn’t check his phone or take meetings early. Why? Because email = other people's priorities. Behavioral psychologist Nir Eyal (author of Indistractable) explains that “turning your attention outward first thing trains your brain to be reactive instead of proactive.” Mental toughness starts with owning your time.



**- Establish a grounding ritual**  

  Whether it’s coffee, journaling, or prayer, repeating the same calm sequence each morning tells your nervous system you’re safe and in control. A 2020 study published in Psychological Science found that consistent morning rituals, even simple ones reduce anxiety and increase perceived control.



This isn’t about perfection. It’s about predictability. Resilience isn’t built by dramatic acts. It’s built by repeating a few unbreakable habits that tell your brain, every day, “We got this.”",1,1771648924.0,MenAscending,0,1.0,False

It's how I was raised and I was raised by a mom who really wanted to be a mom (and AFAIK loved it) and a dad who was kind of there. Worked a lot kind of provider kind of dad. Eventually I met a woman, fell in love, etc. etc. and she very much didn't want kids and that was at 24. It was a weird feeling because you get the whole ""oh, I can do that?"" feeling and I don't think we ever really spoke of it again and just went on living and enjoying life. No thoughts about ""the world is a bad place"", finances of kids, errands, what would life look like, or any of that just the thought that I don't care I'm happy now.  
  
A decade later we divorce (and reading divorce stories thank god we didn't have kids) and go our own ways and now in my mid 30s I had to think about kids again and came to the conclusion, which I guess I still kind of hold to this day, if she was perfect, and we really wanted to, and we really thought about it, **technically** there exists this world where I could see one kid. It just snowed a bunch and seeing dads out sledding with kids looks fun but I know that that 1 hour of fun had everyone screaming to put on their snow suit. But any time I see my future in my head with my future partner I'd rather be looking hot (I may be vain AF not wanting to lose my 6 pack ever), laying on a beach or in a new city, sleeping in and having morning sex and coffee in bed, and generally existing. Those 5% of moments at theme parks, first experiences, new foods, sleeding, etc just don't make up for the other 95%.    
  
It's not that I wouldn't be a good father; just ask my dog who has a better life than most kids (sidenote: he had to go out at 3am this morning and yeah, didn't like that. Now I'm up at 5am monologging). I'm in the top 10% net worth, I have plenty of time, I'm good at multitasking and putting others first, I grew up in a host foster home so I very much know babies/kids, and I have nieces and nephews. On paper ""perfect"" and thus there is some guilt when I see parents who could use some of this or whatnot because despite the ""perfect"" there just isn't desire. I have desire to ski, to climb, to swim, to travel, to fuck, lots of things, just no pull towards fatherhood. Kind of a weird feeling for me since the ""first realization"" was more just an option being presented and now it's ""I'm good"".

My spouse is waiting on a green card and earns money that is not technically reported. He does not have a work authorization. 

I didn’t really think how this could be a big problem at the time, and am now realizing. I don’t want to file a false return, or file it with his info and get him in trouble. He is not able (as far as I know) to put it as self employed because he doesn’t have a work authorization. 

However, he is a partner in this business where he earns most of his money, and he does own his own coffee shop that is fully reporting but this did report at a loss. It is reporting under an EIN 

My questions are this 

A. Do I need to include his coffee shop in my tax return if it’s a business under an ein? 

B. Is this a scenario where I should file separately to protect myself?

C. Could he report his income as self employed even if he doesn’t have a work authorization, if he can provide he’s a business owner / partner?

Our whole lives I've been the more ""popular"" and  ""naturally prettier"" sister. 
Even in high school every guy that she wanted didn't want her that wanted me. It's not my fault. I'm very humble. I've always been like that my whole life and I always am kind to people as much as I can be. I don't lie cheat or steal. I have great female friends in my life as well as an amazing boyfriend and an amazing 2-year-old little girl who is my best friend . 
I was also on a very popular reality TV show with millions of viewers and it's still a part of my life a little bit to this day even though it's been 13 years . Well at least my sister constantly mentions it....

About 6 years ago my twin sister started acting really paranoid with her phone. Leaving it off, airplane mode, fear of being tapped etc 
She got into an enabling relationship (he didn't know she had minor mental problems) she knew how much he was infatuated by her so she took advantage. She started drinking every night and abusing 30mg Adderall and possibly Klonopin too. 
But keep in mind she's 40 years old and she's been non-stop partying probably since she was about 14 but still always managed to function somehow and get things done but always self-medicated one way or another . Never has done any therapy. Never has done any self-help or anything to heal. 

Then she started to become very abusive towards him (physically, financially, verbally, emotionally you name it. She did it to him) 
From throwing bleach in his face, destroying his clothes, getting banned from airlines and arrested at airportss, slashing his face and lip open. 
She put her hands on his 69-year-old mother while on vacation, has been banned from hotels and destroyed hotel property, of course nothing is in her name. She's a spoiled brat and she expects everybody to do everything for her cuz she's so entitled and obsessed with her physical appearance. Her physical appearance is everything to her and it's really sad. I never needed plastic surgery. I'm very naturally pretty and I take pride in that. Especially to show my daughter that you don't have to be a Kardashian to be beautiful in life. I don't judge ... To each their own but do not let it control your life . 
This girl has fake hair, a fake nose, a fake butt. Fake skin,  Like literally everything is fake inside and out. Botox, makeup, skin care, obsessed and another thing she's obsessed with.... is my life.

 I don't know. Honestly, I feel like she's trying to live vicariously through me or she's envious or I have everything that she wanted or she's tired of living in my shadow... But basically it comes down tobShe's now living with me and my daughter and my parents. Everything was great here. Ever since she moved in she's been extremely abusive towards me and my kid as far as verbally and harassing and bullying. My mother is 70 years old. She's an Italian immigrant. She just tries to stay out of it ignores it doesn't know what's going on. On top of it. 

My sister tried to hack my New Jersey family court portal that I have with the father of my child. She tries to hack my Apple iCloud. She tries to hack my Gmail and my Instagram. She has contacted my friends to try to start problems and they all just block her and then they call me immediately because my girls are amazing. She has no friends. Her ex-fiance left her because she got arrested for a third degree aggravated assault case that is still pending. Somehow. He wants nothing to do with her and she was forced to now live with us and she is making everyone's life miserable. 

She completely disrupted the peace. 
 she's always here and everything that she says about me is a projection of herself. I'm here trying to mind my business taking of my kid and when I'm not with my child I live with my boyfriend. I only stay here when I'm parenting my child until my boyfriend and I can get married and buy a house and then eventually during my parenting time she can stay with me and him. And obviously she has time with her real father too.

how about the fact that she also recorded my family court hearings? I have no more privacyat home because she's always eavesdropping. Can't mind her damn business syndrome  literally I'll be on the phone with my boyfriend and she just butts in our conversation or she'll bei loud when the baby is sleeping and then apologize as if she didn't notice. It's just ridiculous. I can't leave my phone around because she'll take it and try to look through it. I have to hide my things. It's absolutely insane.she talks bad about me to my kid. Etc 

t's been 3 months And I've been so patient but this b**** needs to be held accountable and she needs a psych evaluation asap! 
She needs to go get help. Get off the pills and take the proper meds for her brain chemistry. 
And yes I feel sorry for her but she has done a lot of horrible things to me and my family and other people for the last 3 months. So I'm starting to lose Mercy for her. It's one thing if you're sick, don't make everyone else's life miserable around you. It's disgusting ...she's playing with my daughter's life, I'm sorry it's just been super hard :(

 My ex and his family are millionaires and they never liked my sister. They've always wanted her to stay away from the baby but I convinced them that that should not be in the agreement. And now she's living with us and I'm stuck with her and I never thought this would happen. 

If  he finds out ...he's an opportunist.... And yes I know it's for the baby safety but he also has his own issues because I left him due to I'm having severe anger issues and he was financially and emotionally abusing me the entire relationship and while I was pregnant. Plus a bad hoarding secret and I'm the opposite. Con artist as well. 

I have enough on my plate and I do work. I'm a great mom but I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place because of my custody case and then on top of it my parents are in such denial and they're protecting her. It's like they know she's sick and they don't want her to end up in a mental hospital or something. I don't know but it's not safe to keep her like this. 

She's a danger to herself. She's a danger to other people. I could go on and on and on about stories and the delusions. Multiple people could tell stories and what she really is like in the outside world  
She's obsessed that we're being watched. She tried to take my phone one day. She puts cameras everywhere. She plays with the wires. She turned off the power at 6am one morning.drinls and makes hot pots of coffee all day long.  

She harasses the cable guys every time they come because she keeps switching from spectrum to Verizon and thinks that they're being sent here as spies from her ex.  She knows they have footage of her in Hawaii. Acting crazy . Changing the Wi-Fi password.  Staring out the window thinking that we're being washed that there's this car coming by every single night . 
She harasses my child and thinks that my kid and I go and hang out with her. Ex-fiance and his family.

 Constantly asking us where we're going. What are we doing? Blah blah .....then God forbid my kid cries cuz she's a toddler and they cry anl I'm sorry that I don't want her to climb the walls and jump off the furniture so yes, as a discipline my kid she's going to cry and then this one constantly saying why you making her cry constantly getting involved in my parenting constantly talking s*** about me to my family constantly lying all day long lies, lies, lies, plotting seeding. I'm she's f****** nuts dude and she's obsessed with me and I just don't know what to do anymore and I can't make any moves because my mom basically said that if I do get her psych evaluated and God forbid they take her in that she's going to disown me and my daughter which mind you is her one and only granddaughter the one and only grandchild she will ever have the only one she has and ever will have. And should she just let my sister walk around sick like this? What so that the delusions could turn into hallucinations and then eventually turn into voices God forbid? 

 do they honestly think that she'll ever be able to have a serious partner or relationship or even a child being the condition that she is in? 
She literally can't stop lying. She is so vain yet insecure and paranoid. She thinks she's an engineer.amd lawyer. Can't hold a conversation and def has been declining in her maturity. She thinks she's the smartest person in the room. She thinks she's the hottest. She is just literally every bad quality you could think of and I don't even know who the f*** this person is anymore. Entitled little brat speaks to everyone so rudely.

1rahqjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/cant_sleep/comments/1rahqjn/the_summer_i_met_sara/,The Summer I Met Sara,"The summer before I turned 15, I met Sara. She was the most beautiful girl I’d ever seen, with long blond hair the color of sunshine, eyes like a springtime sky, and lips like rosebuds, soft and pink. I didn’t know it at the time, being in the closet, but I had a crush on her.

She was everything I wasn’t. Where I was chubby cheeks and stubby legs, she was lithe, graceful, elegant. Sara moved through the room like she was blessing it with her presence, like we were all lucky to look at her. We’d met at the pool locker room, me trying desperately to pull the Walmart-brand tankini my mother made me wear down over my tummy. Sara was wearing a bikini, and though we were both technically teenagers, it was obvious she was fast on her way to being a woman, while I was still stumbling through baby steps.

Sara looked up from where she was applying lipgloss in the mirror, and smiled when she saw me trying to wrestle my unruly curls into a ponytail. She offered me a wide-toothed comb, “Here,” she said, her voice soft and warm. There was innocence in it, and sweetness, but also depth, like dark chocolate filled with caramel. I took the comb, and smiled at her.

After that day, Sara and I were inseparable. We went everywhere together that summer, riding our bikes down to the boardwalk, swimming together at midnight, playing carnival games and stealing beer from my parents. I’d never had a friend before, not like Sara. Oh, I wasn’t bullied, nothing so cliché. People liked me well enough, and nobody ever said anything untoward, but I was a lonely kid.

I still am, sometimes, if I’m being honest.

But Sara changed that.

She dragged me out of my shell, pulling me into her life. She had this way about her, a kind of gravity. Like she was the sun, and I was lucky to be in her orbit. Sara could’ve made friends with anyone, like Becky G, the head cheerleader, or Danielle R, our school’s homecoming queen two years in a row. I felt chosen, silly as it seems looking back on it now.

There were…strange things about Sara I can see now, with the gift of hindsight. I don’t think I ever once saw her eat. We’d grab lunch at the food court in the mall, and she’d order and pay just like me, but my mind seems to draw a blank on if I ever saw her actually bring a bite of food to her mouth.

Sometimes, when she thought nobody was looking, she went completely still. Not just relaxed- statuesque. No fidgeting, no blinking, I don’t even think she’d breathe. Then, she’d catch me staring and flinch at me, shouting “Boo!”, and we’d laugh it off like she was just trying to scare me. Sometimes, I’d catch her looking at me with this rueful expression, like she felt guilty for something she hadn’t done yet.

I ignored these strange quirks, because I had finally found my first real friend, and everyone was a little weird. Maybe she just had a small appetite, and maybe she really was just trying to scare me. And if she looked at me, well…I wasn’t going to complain.

I introduced her to my parents a few weeks after we met at the pool, having begged them for a sleepover for weeks. They were hesitant. People had been going missing around town, too many stories of people not coming home. But I’d worn them down.

Sara looked uncomfortable standing in the doorway of our small home. My dog, an old Chihuahua named Duke, didn’t like her. The moment she stepped inside, he stood between us, barking his little head off with so much force he was practically jumping. He even snapped at her at one point, growling low in his throat.

“I’m sorry about him,” I said after I put Duke in the backyard, “it’s strange, he normally loves everyone he’s ever met,”

“He must not like my perfume,” Sara smiled, laughing awkwardly,

I nodded, leading her down the hallway to my bedroom, “Come on, why don’t we hang in my room until my parents get home? My dad is bringing home pizza, and my mom got a horror movie from Redbox! Rated-R,” I said, pushing open the door. I was a little embarrassed by the state of my room. It wasn’t messy, but there were still stuffed animals on the shelf, and we hadn’t redecorated it since I was ten. I was starting to regret that. 

Sara sat on my bed, and jolted to her feet as my parents voices filled the room. They weren’t actually home- she’d sat on my old Build-a-Bear. “What’s this?” She asked, her voice soft and non-judgmental

I picked up the stuffed animal, readjusting his clothes. “This is Mr.Bear-Bear, creative, I know. I got sick when I was little, and I ended up spending weeks in the children’s ward. My parents couldn’t always afford the time off to be with me in the hospital. So they made me Mr.Bear-Bear, so that they were always with me, even when I was alone.”

Sara’s face softened, and she nodded, clearing her throat, “That’s so sweet, my parents…never did stuff like that for me,” her voice was thick, heavy. “Do you have any siblings?” She asked suddenly, an almost desperate tinge to her voice.

I decided to ignore it, nodding as I put the bear down. “My older brother, Mike. He’s in Afghanistan right now, but he’ll be home from deployment in a few weeks. I hope,”

Sara nodded. She looked like she was about to say something more, but the front door opened and cut her off.

“Julie! We’re home!” My mom called, and I smiled at Sara, grabbing her hands and pulling her to her feet. 

“Come on,” I said, squeezing her hand reassuringly, “Coming!” I called to my mom.

Sara looked at my parents, smiling at them a little shyly.

“Hi, Mister and Mrs.Delgado,” she said, waving, “it’s so wonderful to meet you,”

My mother smiled, her face warm and bright, “You must be Sara, Julie’s friend. She’s told us all about you. Please, call me Maria,” my mom said, pulling Sara into a warm hug. My mom had always been a hugger, big on physical affection.

My father instead shook her hand, his large calloused palm engulfing her delicate fingers, “Just call me Gabe,” he smiled.

Pizza and soda and snacks were laid out on the coffee table, a veritable feast for any teen. Then, my mother handed me the disc, Paranormal Activity. I had been begging her for months to let me watch it.

“I don’t get how you like that scary stuff, it gives me nightmares,” she shuddered

I laughed as I put the movie into the dvd player in the living room. “That’s the point, Mama, it’s meant to be scary,” I teased her. All the while, Sara said little. As the movie started, the sun setting behind the curtains, I settled in next to her on the couch. 

We shared a blanket, and I could feel the warmth of her seeping into my side. It was nice, undeniably so. As a jumpscare broke the quiet with a loud bang, I yelped, grabbing onto Sara’s arm, burying my face in her shoulder. When I had the courage to look up, I realized she was blushing. I was too.

“Sorry,” I whispered

But Sara only smiled, looking away. “It’s fine. I don’t mind,” she said softly.

As the movie ended, we switched the TV to late-night reruns of Ghost Hunters, my favorite show. It was more for background noise than anything, we were more focused on ourselves. We were giddy, giggling, talking about everything and nothing at all. I was painting Sara’s nails.

“So, you asked me about my siblings, but what about you?” I asked her, looking up. Sara’s eyebrows furrowed for a moment before she nodded, “Two, an older brother and sister. James and Amy. We don’t get along,” she said,

I nodded sympathetically, “Well, that sucks,”

Sara hummed noncommittally, “What about you and your brother?”

I smiled a bit, “Mike? He’s great. He brings me stuff from wherever he gets deployed. And I send him care boxes when I can. I hope you get to meet him soon,” I said, blowing softly on her nails to help the polish dry

Sara and I talked for a while longer about things I don’t remember anymore. Clothes, shoes, celebrity gossip that felt bigger than it really was. I only remember what happened next.

“Have…have you ever kissed anyone before?” Sara asked softly, swallowing and blushing down to her chest.

I looked up into her eyes, shocked, “I- I um, I mean- like, not really? It’s never…come up…” I stuttered, rubbing my neck. I’d had thoughts about it, seen the movies, the tv shows, all the things I was supposed to want. Every time I imagined the future, there was some faceless man filling the blank as I played the role of a Wife, Mother, etc. I didn’t know why at the time, but it always felt wrong.

“Do you…want to?” Sara looked me in the eyes, and I saw a reflection of my own yearning staring back at me. My breath caught in my chest. 

“You mean…us?” I said quietly. I knew about gay people, I’d seen Ellen on tv and the parades that they threw in bigger cities, but all of it seemed so far away, and Sara was right here. She was beautiful, and soft, and sweet, and her lips looked so nice…

I didn’t realize I was leaning in until my lips touched hers. She tasted like lipgloss, and sugar, and something sharp I couldn’t quite name. She let out a sigh, deep and soft, as she pulled me closer. I lost myself in that first kiss, in her. I clung to her, liquid and warm and pliable under her hands.

I forgot everything, everything but this, the reality of her lips on mine, her hands on my body, my hands on hers. Everything else was just confetti-

Until the tip of one of her teeth split my lip. It wasn’t on purpose, but the pain broke the spell we’d woven around ourselves. I jolted back, my hand flying to my lips, and Sara gasped, covering her mouth.

“I’m- oh my god- I’m so sorry-“

I winced, looking down at the blood on my fingertips. It wasn’t a lot, but enough. “It’s fine, Sara, I’m okay,”

The blood had already stopped, and I wiped my mouth off with a slight hiss. I could still taste her lipgloss, now tinged with the metallic tang of my own blood.

After we had calmed down, we laid side by side on the floor in front of the TV. I interlaced my fingers with hers, and so many words sat unsaid between us. I thought we’d have forever to say them. 

“Goodnight,” I whispered softly,

Sara squeezed my hand, “Goodnight…” she replied, her voice sweet and aching.

She was gone before I woke up, a note on the coffee table. 

‘My parents picked me up early, I’ll see you soon- S’

Next to the note, she’d drawn a little heart. My mind was still reeling when my parents came out of their room and I hid the note in my lap.

“Everything okay? Where’d your friend go?” My mom asked, wrapping her bath robe tighter around herself,

“Her parents picked her up early,”

My dad nodded, checking his phone, “It is Sunday. Maybe they’re the religious type,” he shrugged.

As my father started in on making breakfast, my mother helped me clean up the living room. “Sweetheart…is everything okay at home for your friend? She seemed…distant,”

I nodded, tossing empty soda bottles in the bag, “She doesn’t get along with her parents,” I said, shrugging, “she doesn’t like to talk about it much,”

My mom clicked her tongue, “Poor thing. Well, tell her she’s always welcome here…” she paused as she got a good look at my lip

“What on earth-“

I cleared my throat “I tripped…going to the bathroom…?”

My mother gave me a look that told me she didn’t quite believe me, but let it rest.

The next day, I met Sara at the mall, locking my bike to the rack and smiling at her. She smiled back, and we walked inside. I can’t remember how the topic came up, but somehow we decided to do a Photo Booth together.

In the first picture, we’re making peace signs. In the next, duck lips.

The last one sticks out to me, even now. Sara kissed my cheek, holding me close. I could still see the shock on my face in the picture, the blush. How sweet I’d been, shy and young and innocent.

We both took a strip, smiling at the pictures. Sara had this look on her face, not quite regret, but not quite joy either. Something in between.

“My family is throwing a bonfire next week. My…my parents asked me to invite you. They really want to meet you,” she said, looking at me. I nodded, excited.

“I’m sure my parents won’t mind,” I said, taking her hand. 

They, unfortunately, did mind. “A bonfire, in the woods, at night? Julie, we haven’t even met Sara’s parents! Besides, haven’t you been paying attention to the news?”

I looked up, confused, “What do you mean?”

My father rubbed his face. He looked tired, and irritated, “People have been going missing, Julia. Of all ages. Have you been so stuck in the clouds you haven’t noticed?”

The comment stung, but only because it was true. “I just- I thought- Sara wouldn’t let anything happen to me!” I said, crossing my arms defensively.

“Sara is a fifteen year old girl. She can’t protect you. You’re not going, Julia, end of story.” My father rarely put his foot down, but he wasn’t folding on this. And if this were anything else, I might’ve listened to him. I would’ve been a good girl, done what he said.

But it was Sara.

And Sara was…everything.

I still remember that night. My heart was beating out of my chest as I opened my window and popped the screen out, slowly lowering myself down to the ground. I had propped pillows in my bed, unconvincing at best. It was the tail end of summer, and the August heat was sweltering as I rode my bike to the campground Sara had told me to meet her at, smiling when I saw her waving by the sign. She took my hand when I got off my bike, squeezing it reassuringly.

She was quiet as she led me into the woods, but I chalked it up to nerves. I was babbling mindlessly about pretty much nothing, looking around. The sun had set, and I could see the first stars starting to shine as I smelled smoke.

About twenty yards away, I could see it. A large fire, and a group of people. All of them had the same blond hair as Sara, the same blue eyes, the same perfect skin. It was…unsettling.

I could feel the hair on the back of my neck sticking up, but I ignored it. I trusted Sara. She would never hurt me. I would have kept walking, if she didn’t stop.

Sara stood, her breathing heavy. I could see panic on her face, written in every muscle. “Sara?” I asked, squeezing her hand, “Sara, what’s wrong-“

Sara turned to me suddenly, and she looked different. Her eyes were wide and wild, reflecting light in a way that wasn’t quite human, “I’m sorry,” she said suddenly, her voice thick and rough, “I’m so sorry,”

“What are you talking about, Sara are you trying to scare me-“ I laughed, clinging desperately to the idea that this was all a prank, all pretend.

The desperation in her eyes told me it wasn’t.

“Julie, you-“ she swallowed, panting heavily, “You need to run, now! Go!”

Suddenly, a woman’s voice split the air, high and silver and singsong, “Sara! Did you bring your guest?” She called, and there was malice in it. Malice, and hunger.

I could hear more voices. Laughter, surrounding us. Sara’s head whipped around, her long blond hair swinging, “Julia, run! Now! Don’t look back, whatever you do!” She pushed me, hard. “Go. Go!”

Something animal in me gripped my spine, something older than the human mind. It was prey instinct, the fear of a rabbit before a wolf. I knew, in that moment, what I was. And what Sara was.

I stumbled, one step, two, before I turned and ran.

I could hear something behind me. The organic squelch of flesh and cracking of bone. 

I looked back.

Sara wasn’t Sara anymore. She wasn’t human anymore.

Her limbs had elongated, stretching beyond the limits of what I thought was possible, like something within her had yanked them out of their sockets. Her hands dangled past her knees, clawed hands clutching and gripping at the air. And that face- that beautiful face I had come to love- wasn’t hers anymore. Her rose petal lips split at the edges, stretched, opened to reveal a mouth of daggers. Rows and rows of them, too many, sunk into pink gums. her eyes sunken into her skull to reveal deep black pits. Her skin stretched taut, as though any movement might burst it. The only thing that was still her was that long blond hair, flowing down her back in the same waterfall of gold I had come to know.

I heard a cry of rage, and more of the creatures poured out of the clearing. They moved wrong- all impossible angles and elongated limbs, their beautiful masks discarded like trash on the side of the road.

And Sara, my Sara, the thing she had become, turned and raised her arms wide, shielding me.

“RUN!” She roared. It was guttural, thick and loud and wet. But it was her voice- her voice, from the mouth of a monster.

I ran, even as I heard the crash of bodies colliding, the tearing of flesh from bone, cries of pain and fury. Sara was holding the line, for me. She was protecting me.

But one got past.

Branches whipped my face, tearing at my clothes as I sprinted headfirst through the woods. Roots grabbed my ankles, and I had to take care not to trip. I didn’t know where I was going, only that if I stopped running, I’d die.

I could hear the creature behind me, laughing and panting, slathering over itself. “Come on little girl!” He cackled, his claws swiping at my back. The thin fabric of my hoodie caught and tore. I sobbed, crashing through the forest gracelessly.

I could see light ahead, a road. I sprinted headlong into the dark, gasping for air. I ran directly into the road, not caring if there were cars coming.

I heard the squeal of tires breaking, saw headlights cutting through the darkness, and I froze. There was a moment where I thought the truck might hit me, and that seemed a preferable fate to whatever the creature would do. Then, it swerved and struck the monster behind me instead.

He went flying into the dark, and the drivers side door opened to reveal my older brother, Mike. 

“Julie?” He gasped, and I sobbed, running into his arms. 

He wasn’t listening to my frantic explanation and simply shoved me in the truck as a wet growl filled the air behind us. 

He reached into the bed of the truck, pulling out the shotgun he kept there. As the creature leapt, Mike didn’t hesitate. A crack split the night, and buckshot scattered the inside of the creature’s chest. It fell on the road, a wet, guttural cry filling the air. 

This cry wasn’t rage or hunger. It was fear. Simple, animal fear.

Mike didn’t stop, instead he reloaded and stepped forward. The creature shuffled back on broken limbs, and it almost sounded like it was pleading. I closed my eyes and turned away as the second crack sounded. 

He got in the truck, keeping the gun in his lap.

Even from here, I could see his hands shaking. “Julie, what the fuck was that?” He asked, glancing over at me as we sped through the night.

I tried to respond, but everything felt heavy. My back was wet, and warm. Mike looked over at me, turning the light on, and his eyes widened. There was so much blood everywhere. When the creature had torn my hoodie, he’d gotten skin too.

I later woke up in the hospital, needing a course of antibiotics and sutures after everything. What had happened that night trickled down to me, cleaned up and sanitized.

The Greenwood Massacre. Some wild animal had attacked a family, and a young girl had gone missing. The news and gown gossips were abuzz with it for weeks, until they found some other tragedy to glut themselves on. The Greenwood Massacre became nothing but a cold case for YouTube mukbangers to ruminate on for years to come.

Mike, I later learned, had been intending to surprise us with his early return home, and it was sheer luck that he happened to be driving by when I ran into the road.

Sara was still missing, but was presumed dead. My parents comforted me, and scolded me in turn for sneaking out. Mike told the police we had been attacked by some kind of animal, a bobcat or something. But when he took them to the spot the next day, all that remained was a splotch of dark blood. 

I didn’t tell anyone that I had seen Sara again. It was a few weeks later, and I was staring out my window, Mr.Bear-Bear in my arms. I’d been quiet and withdrawn since Sara’s disappearance, and everyone was giving me space. My fifteenth birthday was a few days away. I was thinking about that when I saw her. 

Stepping out of the woods behind my house, illuminated by moonlight. She was human again, or at least looked like one. Her eyes reflected light all wrong, and there was dried blood and gore smeared across her mouth and chest. Her hair was still beautiful, somehow clean and untouched despite the dirt everywhere else. I pressed a hand to the windowpane, my eyes wide. But Sara didn’t come closer, she didn’t step into the light. Instead, she nodded at me once, this look like love in her eyes, and walked backwards into the dark.

It’s been fifteen years since then. I’m not fourteen anymore. I came out, went to college, I have a beautiful girlfriend I love more than anything and a good job I enjoy. I moved away from Greenwood a long time ago. But, sometimes, late at night, I think of her still. Sara, and the summer we shared. Sometimes, I swear I see her, a flash of blond hair or those springtime-sky eyes. Sara, eternally fourteen, still as beautiful as the day I met her.",1,1771648386.0,cant_sleep,0,1.0,False
