Because let's be honest, most of you are out there flailing around like a fish out of water.

You see, the problem isn't with online dating itself. It's with the way most guys approach it. They treat it like a vending machine: insert a few coins (or in this case, a half-assed profile), press a button, and expect a delicious treat to magically appear.

**(Spoiler alert: It rarely works that way.)**

The truth is, online dating is a skill. It's a game. And like any game, it requires strategy, finesse, and a healthy dose of self-awareness.

So, if you're tired of striking out online, listen up. Here's how to turn your digital dating life from a barren wasteland into a thriving oasis of romance:

**1. Craft a Killer Profile**

Your profile is your first impression, your digital storefront. It's what separates you from the sea of other dudes vying for attention.

* **Photos:** Ditch the bathroom selfies, the blurry group shots, and the photos where you're wearing sunglasses and a hat. Invest in professional photos that showcase your personality, your style, and your best features. (Pro tip: hire a photographer who specializes in dating profiles. They know how to make you look your best.)
* **Bio:** No more generic clichés or boring lists of hobbies. Craft a captivating bio that tells a story, highlights your unique qualities, and sparks curiosity. Think humor, intrigue, and a touch of self-deprecation.
* **Prompts:** Most dating apps have prompts or questions you can answer. Use these to showcase your wit, your intelligence, and your unique perspective.

**2. Master the Art of the Swipe**

Online dating is a numbers game, but that doesn't mean you should swipe right on every woman you see. Be strategic, be selective, and be discerning.

* **Quality over Quantity:** Focus on women who genuinely pique your interest. Read their profiles carefully and look for common interests, shared values, and a spark of attraction.
* **Craft Engaging Openers:** Forget the generic ""hey"" or ""what's up?"" Write personalized messages that show you've actually read her profile and are genuinely interested in getting to know her.
* **Keep the Conversation Flowing:** Ask engaging questions, share interesting anecdotes, and use humor to keep her entertained. Be witty, charming, and slightly unpredictable.

**3. Assume the Sale (Without Being a Jerk)**

This is where most guys stumble. They approach online dating with a sense of desperation and neediness, which is a major turn-off for women.

* **Project Confidence:** Believe in yourself and your value. Assume she's already interested and focus on building a connection.
* **Take the Lead:** Don't wait for her to make all the moves. Suggest fun dates, initiate phone calls, and take charge of the interaction.
* **Close the Deal:** Don't be afraid to ask her out. Be direct, confident, and specific.

**4. Consistency is King**

Online dating is a marathon, not a sprint. It requires consistent effort and a long-term perspective.

* **Stay Active:** Log in regularly, swipe on new profiles, and keep the conversation going with your matches.
* **Keep Your Profile Fresh:** Update your photos and bio regularly to keep things interesting.
* **Don't Give Up:** Online dating can be frustrating, but don't throw in the towel. Keep refining your approach, learning from your mistakes, and putting yourself out there.

**The Bottom Line:**

Online dating can be a powerful tool for finding love, but only if you use it correctly. So ditch the half-assed profile, the generic messages, and the desperate vibes.

Instead, craft a killer profile, master the art of conversation, and approach online dating with confidence and a sense of abundance.

After this breakup, a friend of a friend who I had turned down before asked me out last week and we went on a chill coffee date. Then yesterday I got drinks and ice cream with him. He’s very kind and friendly to me but I don’t feel an attraction to him yet. He’s a nerdy engineer type, we have similar interests but he’s not physically the type I would usually go for. I think he even wanted me to come up to his apartment but I awkwardly just went home instead because I didn’t want to do that. I don’t know if it’s because I’m still hung up on this other guy and I feel lonely or I just don’t find him attractive. I’m not writing off attraction to him as I sometimes feel like I could be what they call “demisexual” even though I don’t want to label myself.

My entire life has been a total shit show. Raised by abusive parents, father was an abusive narcissist, we should have been removed but weren’t, failed by multiple agencies etc. sister died of a seizure at 22, father died from a heart attack etc. first serious relationship ended by my ex who I have two sons with, due to his ptsd after being assaulted working in law enforcement. Next relationship, I fell pregnant, ex tried to convince me to terminate, I couldn’t do it, he walked away, my daughter has never met him. When she was 4 months old, I met my most recent ex partner. I was in the depths of post natal depression etc. and boom, I fell pregnant. We were using protection. I went to the doctor to confirm, had my first scan, and when I thought I must have fallen pregnant (condom broke, morning after pill), turns out I was ALREADY PREGNANT. Yes I understand this sounds insane, I’m sure he did something to make this happen. Anyway, as soon as I was pregnant, the nightmare of this man began. He became violent, stopped coming to my house of a night and was just plain mean. I begged him to treat me better. The entire pregnancy I was very sick with preeclampsia and bed ridden, my daughter was born premature weighing only 5 pounds. 3 months after she was born, his behaviour became more abusive. One afternoon, he became angry because I wasn’t listening to him, I was listening to my son instead and he drove erratically, parked us in the middle of a tsection, screamed at me etc. I told him to take us home, he did.. then he got out of the car and started to smash up a car seat and threw my coffee. All of the kids were terrified. He ended up leaving, broke up with me a week later. I respected his decision. He came back multiple times to collect his things, each time he destroyed something at my house. I never said anything. The final straw was when he came here unannounced and stole my car that was in his name. This was after he forced me to sell the car in my name and kept the money from it. He also brought two friends with him when he broke in. Tipped my underwear drawer over my daughter to find the keys. The police came, told him not to come back here and to bring my personal belongings to the police station, he refused, said everything was his.. they argued and said my wallet clearly isn’t... The next day he tried to convince me to let him come here to drop my belongings out of the car off, I was scared and declined. The only item he took to the police station was my wallet. My friend reached out to him to get my items, he only dropped off three things to her, he still has atleast $1000 worth of my belongings. I ended up getting a FVO on him, he turned up to court unrepresented. He used the conference we had later, as a way to further abuse me. Demanded to be allowed to come to my house and take items such as the fridge, microwave and vacuum cleaner.. we now have an order for a further year. I have heard from him twice. Once, to try and get me to meet with him to see his daughter. I believe this was a trap to show I didn’t need protection. I did not meet up with him, I am still terrified of him. He has not made any contact since, didn’t reach out for her birthday or Christmas. He was seen 4 weeks after with the mother of his other child, who is as bad as him, I was gobsmacked. The things these two have done and said to/about each other is unbelievable. He has been seen with her multiple times since, they’re clearly together. 

I have left a lot out, but basically, this man and the men I’ve been with, have all reflected back to me wounds from my childhood, I’ve actively sought out men who are like my father.. and the first and last ex, financially destroyed me. 

So here I am, a year later. I’ve worked on myself. I’ve lost a lot of weight. I’ve worked on my self concept. I am healing wounds from my childhood. I’m now medicated for ADHD/anxiety/depression, my life is 100 times better. I understand that I’m breaking generational trauma. I truely believe my kids are meant to be here and they are the loves of my lives. 
I’m very lucky that I’ve always had an amazing group of friends that have taken care of me during this time. What my most recent ex did to me was the wake up call I needed and what has strengthened my relationship with god/the universe. 

Everyday, for the past year, I have seen angel numbers everyday. I see eagles, butterflies, dragon flies, daily.. I know I’m aligned with my soul purpose, but I’m not seeing movement on my manifestations.. 

I’ve recently joined a dating site, and I cannot connect with anyone on a deeper level, this has never been a problem for me in the past. I rarely click with anyone, and I’m yet to meet up with anyone. 

I’m also not seeing any movement with financial abundance. I’m not able to go back to work, as my youngest is unable to attend daycare due to her poor health. I also don’t have any family to rely on, my friends also work and have young kids. I feel stuck. I’ve entered lotteries, but nothing has eventuated. I don’t understand how to feel more positive about money when my ex financially destroyed me and I can’t go back to work yet?

My ex is extremely wealthy, multiple properties, cars etc. he had 6 cars at the time he stole mine. I’ve avoided taking him for a settlement, as I don’t want to attract his negative energy or give him any kind of contact. I trust the universe will look after my kids and I. 

Does anyone have any tips to help me manifest? I use SATS, affirmations and subliminals every night. I’ve also improved my self concept, it’s the best it’s been my entire life.

I have good days and bad days. It’s been hard being a single parent to 4 kids, one of which having major health issues. I wouldn’t change it though. I just want to be able to provide for my kids and give them what I never had. I’ve taken responsibility for my circumstances and accepted what has happened. 

I’d appreciate any positive advice. If you’re here to roast me, you have bigger issues than mine. 

I apologise for any confusion/being unclear/typos.. I’m trying to get my child to sleep and she is unwell.

1gdror2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Barnesandnoble/comments/1gdror2/a_love_letter_to_yall/,A love letter to y'all! ,"I moved to the US in 2018 (to Texas, from Belgium) I wasn't so much of a book reader back then and I was very lost in life. I knew of B&N but again I wasn't a book girlie. After a couple years I moved to Ithaca in the State of New York and gained more independence to go around on my own. I started reading too. Back then I was dealing with a big burn out following a job situation, I was more and more introverted and started seeing ""autism-like symptoms"" (I use that terminology because I haven't officially been diagnosed but when I research the subject I connect a lot with the ""criteria""). When I started going out in the wild by myself B&N was the only store I felt at peace and was comfortable enough to get out of my shell and do basic things like ask a question to an employee. B&N stores are the only stores (for the most part since not all are identical) to have quiet comfortable floor to walk on (oh you wouldn't know how that matters), low music, and lights not too bright. My autism-like symptoms are very much focused around my 5 senses so you can't imagine the world of a difference it makes walking into a Barnes & Noble versus any other store ever!! The fact that not everything I'm looking at (floor, wall, shelves, etc.) aren't white helps me not feel like everything is too bright, cold, foreigh and overwhelming. 

I want to give a special shoutout to the Barnes & Noble in Ithaca and all their employees. This was really my happy place while my husband was studying in Law School (the whole reason we were in Ithaca). I'll always remember that one day I walked into the store right around opening and it was so quiet I whispered to order my coffee because the employee was whispering. haha The employees have always been so lovely and helpful! I also want to mention this event that happened a couple months ago: I was sitting at a table in the coffee shop section and this tall guy walks up to the spot where the coffees are served. He seemed in great distress and I don't know if he was loud or if the store was quiet (although it was busy) but I heard the whole exchange. He told the employees that he had just gone to the bathroom and that he saw some ""bad words"" on the walls and he was really concerned, didn't know who to tell and that they should be removed, etc. He was kind about it, just overwhelmed. Probably at the same time, the employees and I realized this person was most likely atypical. The reaction of the employees was a masterclass of kindness and understanding! This was so out of nowhere that I'm sure a lot of people would have just said ""yeah yeah we'll take care of it"" and give him a weird look. But they understood right away! I could tell the employees wanted to calm him and were reassuring him that those words were not ok, apologized that he saw them, and thanked him. Their kindness in that moment seriously brought me to tears! 

I'm writing all of this because I came across this subreddit by accident one day while searching something about the rewards program and I read your posts often. I see all of you and I hear all of you and I wish corporate would realize how important your well being at work is sooo important to the customers. We don't want you guys in uniforms (please wear your fave outfits!), we don't want you micromanaged and underpaid!! 

You truly have no idea how for some of us this store is the only way we fight our social anxiety and get out of the house. Especially for someone who has moved as much as I have and I know wherever I'll go in the US I'll find a B&N to calm myself. I'm now in New Jersey and I'm still looking for what will be MY forever  Barnes & Noble but so far all the ones I've visited have been lovely! This store is the only big chain store that still feels like home. If anyone from corporate ever reads this please keep that in mind! 

To all of you, thank you for what you do. You truly don't know how much you impact people's days with something as simple as a cup of coffee and a book! ",5,1730082008.0,Barnesandnoble,0,1.0,False

1gdrltc,https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/1gdrltc/antihistamines_have_saved_me_my_recovery_story/,Antihistamines Have Saved Me (My Recovery Story),"I (23M) was officially diagnosed about 4 months ago with a 40 count of eosinophlis in my upper ephophagus and my ephophagus is ringed. I have almost fully recovered and just wanted to share my story and how Ive managed this disease likey my entire life.  I suspect I had it all my life but because I was a picky eater and knew the feeling I'd get when I ate a trigger (almost a burning sensation) and constant salvation/needing to spit with nausea, I always avoided those foods for the most part and thought nothing of it.  It wasn't till the beginning of this year when I went through the hardest semester of grad school and I had multiple painful impactions that resolved themselves that problems arose. After that I went almost 2 weeks barley eating anything scared and confused why food always got stuck in my throat also causing me to spiral into a depression and lost 20lbs.  My Mother a nurse practitioner prescribed me short term steroids that helped me for a week so I could eat a little before my scope.  My first scope however came back negative with only 5 eosinophlis (because of the systematic steroid I took to help me short term).  The doctor however suspected eoe still due to my rings and symptoms so I went on Pantroprazal 40mg twice a day.  The ppi didn't help me much and only made the little reflux I had worse. What really helped me was fixing my poor college kid diet of coffee, chocolate, and other acid inducing foods down.  Anyways I eventually got scoped again 3 months later with some improvements and now not on any steroids I got my official diagnosis.  At that point I switched PPIs to Omeprazole 20mg twice a day and weened myself off as I had bad side effects from trying multiple ppis that never even helped me.  Also Tums for some reason always gave me shortness of breathe and is probably a trigger for me somehow?  During  this entire time I did an elimination diet eating only beef chicken rice few vegetables and mustard which was literally my only safe foods it seemed as my triggers seem to be nuts fish dairy wheat legumes peas many fruits polen honey corn stevia/artificial sweetners and processed oils. This helped a ton but it wasn't till I tried antihistamines that I could eat almost anything I wanted with little to no symptoms.  Specially I've been taking childrens liquid benadryl with food I know is a trigger and also take a pill and my symptoms just disappear.  I know this isn't good longterm though and more a bandaid but I switched to a new gen antihistamine (zyrtec) daily and since then I've gained back 20 lbs and am practically my normal self again.  I also read on this reddit that the SLS chemical may cause EOE and my toothpaste/handsoaps did have it so I now also use literally just baking soda mixed with water to make it a paste and use that and yes it still works just as good. For soap I just use alcohol/hand sanitizer and Dr. Sasquach as it doesn't have any SLS in it.  I also have the ability to try dupixent but because antihistamines are working for me, ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" I'm putting that on hold.  Hopefully this may work for some of you or may not as everyone is different but just wanted to share my ongoing recovery.  I think the biggest cause of this disease is stress, dry environments (lived in Colorado entire life and no one else in family has this) and eating triggers. So find your triggers, cut out SLS, manage your stress, drink lots of water and you can do it!  Also someone posted about saunas helping them too and I think that has helped some too.",4,1730081740.0,EosinophilicE,2,1.0,False

1gdrk9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1gdrk9c/infrared_saunanystatin/,Infrared Sauna+Nystatin,"Seems to be really helping a lot. It helped before, when I was detoxing from heavy metals prepandemic. I do niacin flushing which is basically where you take 50-100mg of niacin, do aerobic exercise for like 15 minutes to get it pumping through your bloodstream and then get in the sauna for an hour and sweat. My gym even has a cold plunge outside the sauna but I don't use it because I wash off with charcoal soap afterward. And if you have any brain fog/fatigue this will definitely get rid of it. I'm telling you, you'll feel different after especially if you decide to do an enema, I didn't have time to do one today but on my day off from work I will. 

I read somewhere that heavy metal toxicity can lead to candida overgrowth but some other crap in my life definitely lead to mine. I honestly feel as if it got worse with constant mask wearing, I know for a fact that it gave me espogheal yeast infection that did not heal until I the mask mandates went away. I took herbal stuff at the time to minimize the symptoms but it would go away and come back. And candida can spread to other areas of your body once it gets overgrown in one area.

What fucked me up was, a gym with an infrared sauna was supposed to open and then it just never contacted me for months. It does take a long time to get permits from NYC but there was no communication at all. So I did something else and came back and joined this gym that's much more upscale. I'm glad I did honestly. The difference in experience is vast not just because of the sauna but the class offerings and such. Only one of my four gyms has a sauna and it just recently opened. The one I normally go to, everything is built, including a beautiful pool they're just waiting for the permits to be approved by the city. Since that's my home location it will make this weight loss, detox process, even easier whenever it happens.  The location that currently has the sauna, is not far from my home location so it's not that much of an inconvenience for me now. 

The cravings weren't too bad for me. I fucked up and had some fruit the first day, raspberries cause I fucking love them. But there's a supplement called Callumata Fimbriata that I take with meals that decreases your appetite. I also take ayurvedic herbs called Candida Digest. Seems to be making a difference. Even with minimal sugar and some caffeine intake( because I work nights and it's impossible to get through my shift without any coffee.)

I feel so chill today even though I am a little tired due to not having enough sleep. But just thought I would share my experiences to help other people. ",1,1730081602.0,Candida,0,0.99,False

1. After 5 days of silence… just enough to get pregnancy rumors swirling… Carlin Stewart showed up again telling everyone she wasn’t feeling well. She managed to pull it together for some BSB photo shoots, an overview of their beach vacation and a shopping trip for the yearly camping trip. The Stew Crew also had to squeeze in a trip to Nashville for Poppa’s 70th birthday. They are definitely back in the good graces of his family after almost a full year of no contact. They take the kids to Dollywood on a random Tuesday afternoon and Layla can no longer have normal childhood fun bc she is constantly performing for the camera. The kids are constantly in matching outfits and matching Uggs and Zade has basically given up trying to speak and just lets them speak for him now. It’s finally time for this camping trip where they bring 2 carloads worth of stuff plus Zach and Whitney to do all of the cooking and babysitting while these 2 haul around heavy cameras and pretend to have family time. They stay for 20 hours and that is enough time for Evan to mangle a movie screen set up, pop a hole in an air mattress, promote 23 different products and tell us all that he now drinks hot tea. While in his Lululemon sweatsuit. Back at home we learn that Carlin burned her Uggs by the campfire and they feature Layla and Haley walking in to church. Carlin tells us that Haley is wearing Layla’s “old clothes”. Lucky girl. Carlin says she voted early and then shows off PR boxes she was gifted from companies like she is Kim K. I especially enjoyed the OlliePop Cocktail box. Evan makes hibachi using country crock and Lawry’s seasoning and then Carlin has a code for some gut health pills. She says they help her stay regular but I think she can thank the country crock for that. Anyway, she giddily tells us that she and Josie have been secretly planning a big trip for Kelly Joe’s 58th birthday and they are taking her on a trip.  She takes Layla for another trip to the nail spa which means a work day for Layla. She has to film a reel getting dressed, a reel at the salon and several stories when she gets home. Zade is  required to be filmed asleep, shirtless and in a heavy work day for him… he has to say “I love you all the trees and I love you all the moon”. Carlin translates and we just have to take her word for it. Layla films a lipstick ad and Evan throws frozen meals in the oven and calls himself a chef. Kelly Joe is there and she whoops and hollers and pretends to chew and makes the biggest deal over these Lean Cuisine wannabes. Soon enough it’s time for Carlin to film herself in Josie’s pool noodle heading out for the big girls trip. They take Momma B to New Hampshire to ride a train and film tons of content. Carlin seems to be setting Kelly Joe up as a new influencer. Back at home, Evan gets both kids dressed and off to church. He films the kids in the car and we see a camera stand installed in the back seat. These kids never get a break. In 2weeks they have gone on 4 trips, promoted 65 things and there has been zero mention of school, therapy or just being home, quietly playing. It’s sad. 

2. In attempt to give Katie a few extra days of maternity leave, Travis took over the heavy lifting on Social media. He answers questions while Katie takes Haley to get her nails done. Haley sits like a 35 year old while getting her nails painted and of course it’s all filmed and rolled out to the masses. Back at the boring Q and A, Travis tells us  he is releasing a 6 song EP and will be touring to promote it in December. Coming to a church social or fellowship hall near you… love offerings accepted. He tells us Chipotle is his favorite restaurant and that he hates his Tesla and wishes he could sell it. What has soured these goobers on Teslas all of a sudden? Travis pretends that someone asked him for life advice and he says his advice is to go take adventures and play instead of working those few extra days. The privilege oozes out of this kid.  Later in the week, Katie and Travis take Haley and the brand new baby to a pumpkin patch… Katie spends five minutes explaining, justifying and making excuses for why they are there with a brand new baby, but we all know the real reason is… Content. Harvey has to earn his keep and at less than a month old he is already posing so his mom can link everything he wears. Haley is talking in sentences and can say the baby’s s name. Maybe soon she will be able to say… “where’s my money??”  Unlike her sisters Katie does not announce that she is going on Kelly Joe’s birthday trip… But there she is with her tiny little baby that was several weeks early and just had a NICU stay- in an airport, on an airplane, and passed from one sister to the next. Katie honestly looks worn out… You have to wonder who forced her onto this trip? Was it Carlin? Was it Travis? Momma had to pull up her boot straps and get to work…. an influencers life never stops. 

3. When we last talked, the Balka family was still in Stowe living out their Hallmark movie dream. Josie featured an apple pie made with apples that had the sticker still on them.  Proving that she is the real Fundie princess, Josie tells us that Kelton creates all of their travel plans and bookings, and all she has to do is pack her bag and be ready to go.  Once they are back at home, Josie tells us that they are all exhausted from all of their traveling. They have been from Florida to Vermont and are now home only for a day before they head off again on a Balka family camping trip.  She leaves Kelton at home with the girls to cook while she gets in a workout and visits her best friend, the barbers wife, who just had a baby.  Hiding out in her bathroom, Josie says she will be sharing a series on everything you need to know about her pool noodles… She then shares 60 links for other products, flings her hair from side to side and makes lots of hand gestures in the mirror while saying things are ridiculous, so stinking wonderful, so good.  On the camping trip, we see the girls with hairstyles that must take hours to create, lots of snaps of the cuddly baby, and of course, tons of food content.  Josie calls herself a routine girly as she swirls an iced coffee and talks to herself on her phone.  Josie gets picked up at 4 AM by Carlin and Katie to take their mom on this trip to New Hampshire. Josie lets Carlin borrow her jeans and they fix their hair together in a get ready with me TikTok… Honestly, it is uncomfortable seeing them so close. They are pretending to be closer now than they ever were even on the show. There’s lots of smiling and primping and preening for the camera and you just wonder what happened because a year ago these two would not even look at each other. Kelly Joe tells Josie she knows this trip is expensive and Josie just waves her off, money is nothing but water to the Balkas.

4.  Alyssa Webster continues to be miserable. In big exciting news, after one month of no changes to her cheerfullyu brand she has created three reels and her inventory has updated to show three adult hats are gone.  Alyssa herself has started wearing other peoples baseball caps and I can only think it has to be her way of thumbing her nose at this dumb idea that must have been created by John Webster.  That’s right, I’m blaming lurch.  She fascinates us by whining about her laundry, showing off her purchased coffee and her lunchables. She keeps the camera on Rhett, begging him to smile and telling us all how cute, how precious, how amazing he is.  She takes the girls to Publix again to get a free cookie and tells us all it’s holiday season because they have eggnog and mint ice cream.  She sends the girls outside to do yard work and films them all, filtered into oblivion. There is so little going on with this family that when Thursday rolls around and it is time for co-op, they are all absolutely delirious with excitement… Alyssa included.  For some unknown reason, she abruptly deletes her Vlog featuring her trip to Utah and uploads it again. She explains on Instagram that some of the clips did not load… However, the Vlogs appear to be exactly the same. The old Vlog only had about 30,000 views… When she posted it the second time she had 30 comments and almost every one of them were from people saying “what is going on?”  “We have already seen this?”   It’s s a pitiful fall from grace for a woman who was routinely pulling over 100,000 views. Now some of her vlogs have 10,000 views.  She seems to be making decisions off the cuff.  She stumbled upon something that people are actually interested in… Her scrapbooks of each child… But she tosses the girls scrapbooks to the side and only shows Rhett’s- of course… One eagle eyed member noticed a picture of John and Alyssa together at Disney World with Rhett as a baby and that really broke my heart. She’s never going to say she supports Disney, and John is never going to take the little girls… But it appears that king Rhett has all already been. Trace and Lydia stop in for a visit and the kids have no idea who they are.  The girls dress up as Bible characters for church, but Alyssa only grabs a few snaps of them and instead once again focuses on Rhett as he runs away from her, screams and cries. Alyssa says she could watch him all day. Homegirl… you DO! She is trying to get back into influencing Heavy and has a partnership with some vitamin supplements. She tells us she is organizing the girls books and asks for book recommendations.  I hope she took some of the choices she was given because we see Allie reading the life story of Lou Gehrig. Such light reading for a little girl… she takes the kids to an absolutely deserted park where she films Rhett running around in boots and a diaper with the hat on… Her Vlog this week was eight minutes long and was all about a trip to Walmart so the girls could pack their operation Christmas child shoeboxes. In typical Alyssa fashion, she was a drill sergeant who was in charge and made all of the decisions… Such a fun activity. John was nowhere to be seen but his presence is certainly felt in every corner of that sad house.

5.  Whitney Bates quietly slipped away alone for a trip to Arkansas. She says it was to visit her BFF, who happens to be a Duggar-adjacent. She saw some of the Dugs, met Nathan’s son and jetted back to Rocky Top before folks started talking because Fundie women never travel alone.  Zach and Whittney are super excited to be invited on the stew crew annual camping trip even if they are only invited so they can do all of the work. Whittney is able to swing links from beside a campfire and the entire family of seven sleeps in a tent that is on the roof of their car… I just hope no one wets the bed. They take their brand, new electric bikes and film themselves riding without helmets.  After the camping trip that was really just a camping visit, Whitney loaded up her kids and heads to Chuck E. Cheese for the day. Zach is hard at work filming content with his mom in the kitchen because Kelly Joe really seems to pull in the views. Zach and Kelly have a question and answer session. Kelly Joe says she is at the farm every other week now and when she is there, she makes a weeks worth of meals. She says she and Zach are filming holiday favorites and they list all of the best cooks in their family. They do not name Erin.  Whitney shows up at the boutique and says she decided to work one day for the week… The other girls model overpriced dresses. The boutique must be self sustaining now because Whitney is out the door and off to the pumpkin patch with Zach and their five kids.  Zach is back in the Bates kitchen again, crying over an onion… This week he’s making his world famous chili. However, his kids don’t like tomatoes and he doesn’t like beans so you end up with a pot of wet, red, hamburger meat. He serves it over corn chips with lettuce and sour cream and cheese. Per usual, he forgets several steps and several ingredients along the way, but we do get to watch as he meticulously cuts every single vegetable. Maybe he should rename this Zach plays with knives? For some unknown reason, his cooking show is sponsored this week by a mattress company.

6.Michael Keilen would really like for you to purchase her hand painted wooden Christmas ornaments or her hand sewn matching aprons for daughters and mothers. If she could just sell enough, Brandon would not have to work this real job.  Brandon still finds time to record himself coloring and draws a floppy eared rabbit with Brookie. The kid had to evacuate from a storm only to find herself in front of the red light drawing cartoon animals with her weird uncle.  Michael has a professional photo shoot for her new apron line at Josie’s house. Olivia Michael has a professional photo shoot for her new apron line at Josie‘s house. Lydia is the photographer and Josie‘s and Tori’s girls are the models. Gotta pay for that babysitting some how ladies! This week in Keilen Corner Michael and Brandon tell us all about how they kept and entertained 10 kids during the hurricane… They took the Smith kids and the Paine kids to the zoo… Brandon almost had an anxiety attack but Michael was not concerned because she has been taking 10 kids places all of her life. Of course JebJud went with them but he doesn’t count as one of the 10 because he obviously lives with them now. Later, they made caramel apples at the big house… No Gil and no Kelly Joe to be seen.

7. Lydia and Trace made it back from Hawaii just in time to see Ryker take his very first steps…JebJud are with them and they all go for a ride on their new electric bikes. Trace keeps calling the bike helmet a hat… it’s so obvious how much they use them when they aren’t filming…. Proving that they can be successful influencers also, Trace and Lydia head to a resort in Florida that has given them a free trip in exchange for promotion. This time baby Ryker gets to go with them and they go to Disney World for the day. They are only in Florida for two days, but manage to stop off at Alyssa’s house to remind her children that they have an Uncle Trace.   They also see Jackson and Emmy.  The weekly Vlog finds them back in Hawaii. Trace forces Lydia to climb to the top of diamond head in the 90° heat… The two of them, panting and huffing and puffing to reach the top of a mountain just so they can point out some hotels in the distance. This whole trip to Hawaii is the two of them walking around with a camera in their face while they shop at Marshalls and H&M. Trace is scared to death to try the exotic flavor mango and tells us he has eaten raising canes chicken tenders four times on the trip. He also says it was worth flying 10,000 miles to eat frozen yogurt. This doofus keeps telling us what is gonnna happen DOmorrow and domorrow is just as boring as DOday. Anyway, they make it back to Tennessee and tell us over and over how much Lydia‘s family enjoyed keeping Ryker and how he was no trouble at all. 10 seconds after walking in the house Lydia‘s sister tells Trace the first couple of days were rough… his mouth was hanging open. He was not expecting to hear that! Good for her for telling the truth… Keeping a 13 month old for 10 days is not a walk in the park.

8.  Tiffy Bates is over the moon excited that the man of the house Lawson Bates has returned from his long suffering work with MedicCorp.  As soon as Lawson can get settled, he throws up a Vlog showing warden installing a fancy commode at their house… He then tries and fails several times to install childproof locks on their cabinets. Only after Tiffany steps in and shows him a YouTube video can he figure it out. How did she ever survive without him there? He is back to his old tricks of speaking like a newscaster announcing the 6 o’clock news and talking over the top of Tiffany and acting like a know it all around her parents …they must think he is insufferable. Tiffy continues to post Lawson‘s baby pictures and ask people if baby Will looks like Lawson. People keep telling her “no, he looks like you”… But she won’t listen. She says Lawson is a green flag. Where was she on January 6?  With Lawson back in town, Tiffany is shoved to the side. We see Lawson and baby Will decked out in Tennessee football gear and in a second Vlog, we get to see their trip with the baby to the farm to meet Papa Bill and Jane Jane.  They all go to Myrtle Beach in a little camper that Lawson calls a new camper. For some reason they show Tiffany covered in baby poop… Lawson holds the baby like it’s a possession and you never see him cuddling and holding the baby close. Lawson actually gets his hands dirty doing some gardening and Tiffany says he is good at everything. I wonder why she feels the need to campaign so hard for him? They keep the camera mere inches from the babies face. Lawson does a Q and A where he says they are California dreaming and will be heading there soon. He also says that Tiffany can go back to acting anytime she wants to. Lawson is clearly jealous of Travis Clark because he continues to push out his old music and promote his old albums.

9. Erin Paine was back on social media… there she was banging away at the keyboard while Brookie sang her little heart out trying to please her mother and prove herself a worthy cult member.  Erin features a reel about their evacuation to Tennessee - says they had a wonderful time but gives the excuse that they had colds and that is why they couldn’t see all of the cousins. Those colds did not keep them from seeing the Smiths though.  Someone asks if they are moving soon and if they know where they are moving and Erin answers that she will let everyone know as soon as they figure it out. I guess no one has offered a free home yet.  We see them all having a picnic and baby William has a smoothie. Later, Erin celebrates 3 years of Chad and Erin Co. She thanks everyone for supporting them, and calls the business their mission and outreach. Someone needs to remind her that she charges for those doodles and does not give them away for free. 

10. Jinger and Jeremy Vuolo talked about their trip to Tennessee for Jana Duggar‘s wedding. They say that Carlin and Evan were in charge of all the videography for the wedding and were working the event. They also say that Carlin took the Dug girls to their boutique and let everyone pick out a brand new wardrobe. They were there late at night and Jinger was hungry. Zach and Jackson went back to Zach and Whitney‘s house and made homemade pretzels for everyone at 1 o’clock in the morning. According to Jinger, the Bates kids could always stay up super late at night.

Have a great week friends… and a fun Halloween!🎃

Part 1 ,"This was a big story on another sub, up until a few weeks ago. I know the OP well and was given permission to re-share his story here on his behalf. I will first share the posts he had previously written in multiple parts for those who are unfamiliar with the story. After that, I will share his most recent updates.


I caught my wife cheating with another man and I am utterly devastated.

My (37M) wife (35F) and I have been married for 8 years, together for 10. We have been through thick and thin. She is my best friend and the love of my life. We don’t have any kids. We wanted them, but it wasn’t in the cards for us. 

Today, during my lunch break, I decided to explore a new area, to try out a different place. As I strolled along the sidewalk, I saw my wife stepping out of a coffee shop across the street with a man I recognized from her work. They were smiling and chatting, and then the man slipped his arm around her waist pulling her closer, leaned in and kissed her. And she kissed him back. 

I froze, unable to process what I was seeing. In that moment, everything around me faded into a blur. I stood there, barely believing what I was seeing. This couldn’t be happening. I wanted to scream, to run across the street and demand an explanation, but I couldn’t move. It was as though I was anchored to the pavement.

As they turned to walk away, still caught up in their own world, I realized they didn’t even see me. A jarring mix of hurt and betrayal pierced through the shock. 

I can’t wrap my mind around what I saw. I love this woman more than life itself. I have given her all of me. I have loved her unconditionally. I am crushed. Gutted. 

I can’t remember how the rest of the day went after that. It was all a blur. I couldn’t face going back home to face her, so I told her I needed to stay at a friend’s house tonight because he’s going through a rough time and could use the support. She bought it. I am sleeping in my car tonight. 

My world is falling apart, and I don’t know what to do now. ",14,1730081582.0,stories,11,0.94,False

He films the kids in the car and we see a camera stand installed in the back seat. These kids never get a break. In 2weeks they have gone on 4 trips, promoted 65 things and there has been zero mention of school, therapy or just being home, quietly playing. It’s sad. 

2. In attempt to give Katie a few extra days of maternity leave, Travis took over the heavy lifting on Social media. He answers questions while Katie takes Haley to get her nails done. Haley sits like a 35 year old while getting her nails painted and of course it’s all filmed and rolled out to the masses. Back at the boring Q and A, Travis tells us  he is releasing a 6 song EP and will be touring to promote it in December. Coming to a church social or fellowship hall near you… love offerings accepted. He tells us Chipotle is his favorite restaurant and that he hates his Tesla and wishes he could sell it. What has soured these goobers on Teslas all of a sudden? Travis pretends that someone asked him for life advice and he says his advice is to go take adventures and play instead of working those few extra days. The privilege oozes out of this kid.  Later in the week, Katie and Travis take Haley and the brand new baby to a pumpkin patch… Katie spends five minutes explaining, justifying and making excuses for why they are there with a brand new baby, but we all know the real reason is… Content. Harvey has to earn his keep and at less than a month old he is already posing so his mom can link everything he wears. Haley is talking in sentences and can say the baby’s s name. Maybe soon she will be able to say… “where’s my money??”  Unlike her sisters Katie does not announce that she is going on Kelly Joe’s birthday trip… But there she is with her tiny little baby that was several weeks early and just had a NICU stay- in an airport, on an airplane, and passed from one sister to the next. Katie honestly looks worn out… You have to wonder who forced her onto this trip? Was it Carlin? Was it Travis? Momma had to pull up her boot straps and get to work…. an influencers life never stops. 

3. When we last talked, the Balka family was still in Stowe living out their Hallmark movie dream. Josie featured an apple pie made with apples that had the sticker still on them.  Proving that she is the real Fundie princess, Josie tells us that Kelton creates all of their travel plans and bookings, and all she has to do is pack her bag and be ready to go.  Once they are back at home, Josie tells us that they are all exhausted from all of their traveling. They have been from Florida to Vermont and are now home only for a day before they head off again on a Balka family camping trip.  She leaves Kelton at home with the girls to cook while she gets in a workout and visits her best friend, the barbers wife, who just had a baby.  Hiding out in her bathroom, Josie says she will be sharing a series on everything you need to know about her pool noodles… She then shares 60 links for other products, flings her hair from side to side and makes lots of hand gestures in the mirror while saying things are ridiculous, so stinking wonderful, so good.  On the camping trip, we see the girls with hairstyles that must take hours to create, lots of snaps of the cuddly baby, and of course, tons of food content.  Josie calls herself a routine girly as she swirls an iced coffee and talks to herself on her phone.  Josie gets picked up at 4 AM by Carlin and Katie to take their mom on this trip to New Hampshire. Josie lets Carlin borrow her jeans and they fix their hair together in a get ready with me TikTok… Honestly, it is uncomfortable seeing them so close. They are pretending to be closer now than they ever were even on the show. There’s lots of smiling and primping and preening for the camera and you just wonder what happened because a year ago these two would not even look at each other. Kelly Joe tells Josie she knows this trip is expensive and Josie just waves her off, money is nothing but water to the Balkas.

4.  Alyssa Webster continues to be miserable. In big exciting news, after one month of no changes to her cheerfullyu brand she has created three reels and her inventory has updated to show three adult hats are gone.  Alyssa herself has started wearing other peoples baseball caps and I can only think it has to be her way of thumbing her nose at this dumb idea that must have been created by John Webster.  That’s right, I’m blaming lurch.  She fascinates us by whining about her laundry, showing off her purchased coffee and her lunchables. She keeps the camera on Rhett, begging him to smile and telling us all how cute, how precious, how amazing he is.  She takes the girls to Publix again to get a free cookie and tells us all it’s holiday season because they have eggnog and mint ice cream.  She sends the girls outside to do yard work and films them all, filtered into oblivion. There is so little going on with this family that when Thursday rolls around and it is time for co-op, they are all absolutely delirious with excitement… Alyssa included.  For some unknown reason, she abruptly deletes her Vlog featuring her trip to Utah and uploads it again. She explains on Instagram that some of the clips did not load… However, the Vlogs appear to be exactly the same. The old Vlog only had about 30,000 views… When she posted it the second time she had 30 comments and almost every one of them were from people saying “what is going on?”  “We have already seen this?”   It’s s a pitiful fall from grace for a woman who was routinely pulling over 100,000 views. Now some of her vlogs have 10,000 views.  She seems to be making decisions off the cuff.  She stumbled upon something that people are actually interested in… Her scrapbooks of each child… But she tosses the girls scrapbooks to the side and only shows Rhett’s- of course… One eagle eyed member noticed a picture of John and Alyssa together at Disney World with Rhett as a baby and that really broke my heart. She’s never going to say she supports Disney, and John is never going to take the little girls… But it appears that king Rhett has all already been. Trace and Lydia stop in for a visit and the kids have no idea who they are.  The girls dress up as Bible characters for church, but Alyssa only grabs a few snaps of them and instead once again focuses on Rhett as he runs away from her, screams and cries. Alyssa says she could watch him all day. Homegirl… you DO! She is trying to get back into influencing Heavy and has a partnership with some vitamin supplements. She tells us she is organizing the girls books and asks for book recommendations.  I hope she took some of the choices she was given because we see Allie reading the life story of Lou Gehrig. Such light reading for a little girl… she takes the kids to an absolutely deserted park where she films Rhett running around in boots and a diaper with the hat on… Her Vlog this week was eight minutes long and was all about a trip to Walmart so the girls could pack their operation Christmas child shoeboxes. In typical Alyssa fashion, she was a drill sergeant who was in charge and made all of the decisions… Such a fun activity. John was nowhere to be seen but his presence is certainly felt in every corner of that sad house.

5.  Whitney Bates quietly slipped away alone for a trip to Arkansas. She says it was to visit her BFF, who happens to be a Duggar-adjacent. She saw some of the Dugs, met Nathan’s son and jetted back to Rocky Top before folks started talking because Fundie women never travel alone.  Zach and Whitney are super excited to be invited on the stew crew annual camping trip even if they are only invited so they can do all of the work. Whitney is able to sling links from beside a campfire and the entire family of seven sleeps in a tent that is on the roof of their car… I just hope no one wets the bed. They take their brand, new electric bikes and film themselves riding without helmets.  After the camping trip that was really just a camping visit, Whitney loaded up her kids and heads to Chuck E. Cheese for the day. Zach is hard at work filming content with his mom in the kitchen because Kelly Joe really seems to pull in the views. Zach and Kelly have a question and answer session. Kelly Joe says she is at the farm every other week now and when she is there, she makes a weeks worth of meals. She says she and Zach are filming holiday favorites and they list all of the best cooks in their family. They do not name Erin.  Whitney shows up at the boutique and says she decided to work one day for the week… The other girls model overpriced dresses. The boutique must be self sustaining now because Whitney is out the door and off to the pumpkin patch with Zach and their five kids.  Zach is back in the Bates kitchen again, crying over an onion… This week he’s making his world famous chili. However, his kids don’t like tomatoes and he doesn’t like beans so you end up with a pot of wet, red, hamburger meat. He serves it over corn chips with lettuce and sour cream and cheese. Per usual, he forgets several steps and several ingredients along the way, but we do get to watch as he meticulously cuts every single vegetable. Maybe he should rename this Zach plays with knives? For some unknown reason, his cooking show is sponsored this week by a mattress company.

6.Michael Keilen would really like for you to purchase her hand painted wooden Christmas ornaments or her hand sewn matching aprons for daughters and mothers. If she could just sell enough, Brandon would not have to work this real job.  Brandon still finds time to record himself coloring and draws a floppy eared rabbit with Brookie. The kid had to evacuate from a storm only to find herself in front of the red light drawing cartoon animals with her weird uncle.  Michael has a professional photo shoot for her new apron line at Josie’s house. Olivia Michael has a professional photo shoot for her new apron line at Josie‘s house. Lydia is the photographer and Josie‘s and Tori’s girls are the models. Gotta pay for that babysitting some how ladies! This week in Keilen Corner Michael and Brandon tell us all about how they kept and entertained 10 kids during the hurricane… They took the Smith kids and the Paine kids to the zoo… Brandon almost had an anxiety attack but Michael was not concerned because she has been taking 10 kids places all of her life. Of course JebJud went with them but he doesn’t count as one of the 10 because he obviously lives with them now. Later, they made caramel apples at the big house… No Gil and no Kelly Joe to be seen.

7. Lydia and Trace made it back from Hawaii just in time to see Ryker take his very first steps…JebJud are with them and they all go for a ride on their new electric bikes. Trace keeps calling the bike helmet a hat… it’s so obvious how much they use them when they aren’t filming…. Proving that they can be successful influencers also, Trace and Lydia head to a resort in Florida that has given them a free trip in exchange for promotion. This time baby Ryker gets to go with them and they go to Disney World for the day. They are only in Florida for two days, but manage to stop off at Alyssa’s house to remind her children that they have an Uncle Trace.   They also see Jackson and Emmy.  The weekly Vlog finds them back in Hawaii. Trace forces Lydia to climb to the top of diamond head in the 90° heat… The two of them, panting and huffing and puffing to reach the top of a mountain just so they can point out some hotels in the distance. This whole trip to Hawaii is the two of them walking around with a camera in their face while they shop at Marshalls and H&M. Trace is scared to death to try the exotic flavor mango and tells us he has eaten raising canes chicken tenders four times on the trip. He also says it was worth flying 10,000 miles to eat frozen yogurt. This doofus keeps telling us what is gonnna happen DOmorrow and domorrow is just as boring as DOday. Anyway, they make it back to Tennessee and tell us over and over how much Lydia‘s family enjoyed keeping Ryker and how he was no trouble at all. 10 seconds after walking in the house Lydia‘s sister tells Trace the first couple of days were rough… his mouth was hanging open. He was not expecting to hear that! Good for her for telling the truth… Keeping a 13 month old for 10 days is not a walk in the park.

8.  Tiffy Bates is over the moon excited that the man of the house Lawson Bates has returned from his long suffering work with MedicCorp.  As soon as Lawson can get settled, he throws up a Vlog showing warden installing a fancy commode at their house… He then tries and fails several times to install childproof locks on their cabinets. Only after Tiffany steps in and shows him a YouTube video can he figure it out. How did she ever survive without him there? He is back to his old tricks of speaking like a newscaster announcing the 6 o’clock news and talking over the top of Tiffany and acting like a know it all around her parents …they must think he is insufferable. Tiffy continues to post Lawson‘s baby pictures and ask people if baby Will looks like Lawson. People keep telling her “no, he looks like you”… But she won’t listen. She says Lawson is a green flag. Where was she on January 6?  With Lawson back in town, Tiffany is shoved to the side. We see Lawson and baby Will decked out in Tennessee football gear and in a second Vlog, we get to see their trip with the baby to the farm to meet Papa Bill and Jane Jane.  They all go to Myrtle Beach in a little camper that Lawson calls a new camper. For some reason they show Tiffany covered in baby poop… Lawson holds the baby like it’s a possession and you never see him cuddling and holding the baby close. Lawson actually gets his hands dirty doing some gardening and Tiffany says he is good at everything. I wonder why she feels the need to campaign so hard for him? They keep the camera mere inches from the babies face. Lawson does a Q and A where he says they are California dreaming and will be heading there soon. He also says that Tiffany can go back to acting anytime she wants to. Lawson is clearly jealous of Travis Clark because he continues to push out his old music and promote his old albums.

9. Erin Paine was back on social media… there she was banging away at the keyboard while Brookie sang her little heart out trying to please her mother and prove herself a worthy cult member.  Erin features a reel about their evacuation to Tennessee - says they had a wonderful time but gives the excuse that they had colds and that is why they couldn’t see all of the cousins. Those colds did not keep them from seeing the Smiths though.  Someone asks if they are moving soon and if they know where they are moving and Erin answers that she will let everyone know as soon as they figure it out. I guess no one has offered a free home yet.  We see them all having a picnic and baby William has a smoothie. Later, Erin celebrates 3 years of Chad and Erin Co. She thanks everyone for supporting them, and calls the business their mission and outreach. Someone needs to remind her that she charges for those doodles and does not give them away for free. 

10. Jinger and Jeremy Vuolo talked about their trip to Tennessee for Jana Duggar‘s wedding. They say that Carlin and Evan were in charge of all the videography for the wedding and were working the event. They also say that Carlin took the Dug girls to their boutique and let everyone pick out a brand new wardrobe. They were there late at night and Jinger was hungry. Zach and Jackson went back to Zach and Whitney‘s house and made homemade pretzels for everyone at 1 o’clock in the morning. According to Jinger, the Bates kids could always stay up super late at night.

Have a great week friends… and a fun Halloween!🎃

“Well, that’s a problem,” Bob muttered, staring at the cobblestone beneath their feet. They had arrived with plenty of time to set up their food booth, but...

Richard, George, and Bob stood at the empty spot where their booth should have been while Rick went off to buy supplies for the day.

“What?” Richard grumbled. There had been nothing but problems.

“How are we going to stake our tent in cobblestone?” Bob asked.

“What?” Richard looked down. He had never put up a tent in a town before. ""Oh no.""

”Problem?” a voice said from the booth next to them. Richard turned toward the voice.

Richard, George, and Bob stared at the being before them. Judging by her build, she appeared to be female. She was a head shorter than an average human, with hair black as midnight and striking emerald eyes.

Before they could respond, another voice behind them said, “Oh boy, that’s not going to work.” Bob and Richard turned to see two men shaking their heads in disapproval. “You two are trying to pitch a tent? It won’t work. You need to open it up and anchor it.”

Bob and Richard looked at each other, shrugging. George chuckled.

”Let me help,” the woman said. ""By the way, I’m Grazia. I’m a Fata; everyone always asks.” She smiled as she walked over, her presence bringing a sense of relief to the group.

The two men joined them.

”I’m Duff, and he’s Buddy,” the blonde human man said. The brunette man waved. “We made that mistake our first time, too.”

As the three of them explained what to do, they began rearranging the tent:

“You don’t need sides; open it up and let everyone see in.” 

“The wind will knock it over; you need straps to tie it down.” 

More voices joined in as more people started to help. 

“I got some straps you can use.” 

“I've got extra weights; you can use those.”

”What do you sell?” someone from the crowd asked.

Richard smiled, glad to get a question he knew he could answer, “Hot dogs and vanilla lattes.”

The crowd fell silent. “Hey, are you the orcs who run that restaurant outside of town?”

Bob looked at the crowd, “Uh, yes.”

The crowd cheered.

”I love your vanilla latte.”

”The BLT was delicious.”

”Hot dogs! I’m so happy.”

”When will you be ready to serve?”

Richard grinned, “As soon as we’re set up, we’ll start serving.”

The crowd cheered again. Richard and Bob grinned; they were going to make so much money. The tent was set, and the tables were in their spots. George began to set up the coffee station.

“Did someone order a stove?” boomed a voice over the crowd. A large, muscular man pulling a cart stopped. Sootie was in his human form, which they were more used to. He was still impressive in his human form.

“Thank you, Sootie,” Richard said.

Bob peered into the cart. “Hey, what’s this?”

Sootie grinned, “I’ve been thinking. You need a flat top for bacon and eggs, but your hot dogs will cook better on a grill. So, I combined them into one. I call it the Grand Griddle Grill Cooking Apparatus.” He grinned, clearly pleased with himself. ""Also, I saw how you were making your fries. Behold,” Sootie gestured, “I call it a deep grease potato fryer apparatus.”

“Impressive,” Bob said, “This is going to be great to cook with.”

Richard eyed the new equipment warily. So far, his attempts at cooking had yet to turn out edible. One day after lunch, he’d tried cooking bacon again, and the twins had threatened him. Usually, threatening a chief would call for an execution, but he felt it was fair after what he had served them.

“Can you put the griddle grill cooking apparatus here and the deep grease potato fryer apparatus here,” Bob pointed. “What do you think, Chief? Good spots for me to cook. You can take orders here, George will handle the coffee, and Rick can bring out the food.”

Richard looked over where Bob was pointing. “Yeah,” He said quietly, “Yeah, this is great.” He said more loudly, his confidence growing as he got into the idea.

Bob and Richard looked at each other and said, “We are going to make so much gold!”

“I hope so,” Sootie said. ""I’m expecting you to buy more of my apparatuses.” He gave them a broad, friendly smile.

“Of course,” Richard said, “The twins will flip when they see this.”

“Good, good,” Sootie said. ""I’ll put you down for three each.” He grinned again.

Richard and Bob looked at each other and said, “Yes!”

“Now, then, boys.” Sooite said, “I’ll take two vanilla lattes to go. Ruby would be mad if I didn’t bring her back one.”

“On it!” George shouted and went to work. Thankfully, they had brought some supplies with them.

Rick returned with a wagon full of bacon, eggs, bread, milk, sausages, and potatoes. They positioned the wagon behind the tent to quickly grab what they needed. (Hello, dear reader. I would like to take a moment to explain why the eggs, milk, and sausage don’t spoil. Magic. Thank you.)

Soon, a line formed as people eagerly awaited their BLTs and vanilla lattes. The festival hadn’t started, and they were already popular.

“Hey, neighbors,” Grazia shouted to the busy Orcs and Imp. Richard looked over and waved, “This vanilla latte is divine."" They happily gave everyone who helped free breakfast and lattes. It was a good investment as everyone went out and spread the word. “I’ll bring you boys one of my pies later.”

Richard waved again with a grin, “Thank you. Looking forward to it.”

From the other side of the Orc’s tent, “Got a cool, delicious vanilla latte? Pair it with a baked good. We have something for everyone. A nice baked good after some hearty BLT will hit the spot!”

Richard was impressed by how quickly everyone accepted them and found ways to cooperate. The line didn’t slack until closer to noon, when suddenly everyone disappeared.

“What’s going on?” Bob asked as Richard shrugged.

“Open ceremonies,” Duff said, “If you haven’t seen it, you need to.”

“Who wants to stay behind,” Richard asked.

“No one,” a rough voice behind him said. ""You all need to see it at least once.” 

Richard spun around, grinning wide. “Battleax!”

“Ah, Chief Richard. I see you pups are doing good,” The old barbarian gave them a gapped-tooth grin.

“It’s been good for us,” Bob said.

“Well, then take a break and see the opening ceremonies,” Battleax said. “I’ve seen them, and they are quite impressive.”

“But what about…” Richard gestured to the tent.

Battleax laughed, “This is my spot to watch. I got from one end of the street to the other end.”

“That’s a lot of ground to watch,” Bob said.

“Meh, word got out about what happened a few years ago, and I’ve not had any trouble since,” Battleax said.

“Uh, what happened?” Bob asked, intrigued.

Battleax gave his signature wild-eyed grin, “Took an hour to clean up the mess.”

Bob held his hands up, “Yeah, I’m good. I just had breakfast.”

Richard laughed, “Me too.” He turned to his crew, “Let’s go, everyone.”

The Orcs and imp joined Buddy, Duff, and Grazia as they made their way to the main stage. It was built at the end of the main road, and from the stage, the main entrance could be seen past the fountain. The festival was spread out in rows of booths like spokes on a wheel with the fountain as a hub. Mayor Hamilton prided himself on his organizational skills. With the rows laid out to lead to and from the fountain, a thief could be herded to the fountain, where it was easier to clean up the mess.

The crowd grew to an enormous size in front of the main stage. Buzzing with excitement, many had seen the ceremony before and knew it was always impressive.

Figures cloaked in purple hooded robes gathered on the stage. They began to hum softly, and the crowd gradually fell silent as the sound grew louder. Soon, the hum became a chant. It was low and unearthly. Drums began to beat—boom, boom. Richard could feel his heart race. It was like they were getting ready to charge into battle—boom, boom.

One figure stepped forward and threw back her hood, revealing a short purple-haired woman. Her outfit was made up of various shades of purple. She wore a wide-brimmed, pointy hat that appeared to be crocheted and, of course, it was purple. The most striking feature was her purple eyes.

“Welcome all, we are the storytellers,” The woman announced over the silent crowd. “We are here to celebrate the elder god Judy. She who chose the eternal slumber to save reality. She who slumbers and dreams of us. She who will never awaken. She the eternal storyteller, the keeper of our stories!” She spread her arms, “Let the festival of Raconteuse begin!”

The crowd cheered!

“I think we should have asked more questions,” Bob said to Richard, who nodded in agreement.

Since making my original post 4 months ago (reposted below so appears on feed), I have switched to a plant-based diet and have continued my 10mg of Crestor and added 10mg of Zetia. I do eat fish, have upped my fiber quite a bit, and still enjoy wine every once in a while. Here's the update:

General Bloodwork (any feedback is really appreciated!):

* **Hemoglobin** A1C is 5.1% and considered in normal range
* **Fasting glucose** is 79 mg/dL and considered in normal range
* **Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)** is 15 u/L (you want<30 u/L)
* **Alkaline Phosphatase** is 52 u/L (you want <125 u/L)
* **Bilirubin** 0.5 mg/dL (you want <1.0 mg/dL)
* **Creatinine** is 0.61mg/dL (you want <1.10 mg/dL)
* **EGFR (Creatinine-Based Formula CKD-EPI 2021)** is 117 mL (you want >60mL/min/BSA)
* **Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)** is 1.01 mcIU/mL and considered in normal range
* **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)** is 9 mg/dL (you want <18mg/dL; although mine went from 5mg/dL in 2017 to now 9 mg/dL)
* **Lipase** is 25 u/L (you want <58 u/L; although mine went from 15 u/L in 2017 to now 25 u/L)
* **Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate** is 99 mcg/dL and considered in normal range
* **Prolactin** is 10.6 ng/mL and considered in normal range
* **Testosterone** is 20 ng/dL and considered in normal range (albeit on the low end and was at 11ng/dL a year ago)
* **Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)** is 16 u/L (you want<54 u/L)

Lipid Panel:

* **Overall Cholesterol**: 191 mg/dL (6/22/24) to 125mg/dL (10/26/24)
* **HDL**: 58 mg/dL (6/22/24) to 43 mg/dL (10/26/24)
* **Triglycerides**: 87 mg/dL (6/22/24) to 127 mg/dL (10/26/24)
* **LDL**: 117 mg/dL (6/22/24) to 59mg/dL (10/26/24) (WOOHOO!)
* **Cholesterol/High Density Lipoprotein**: 3.3 (6/22/24) to 2.9 (10/26/24)
* **Cholesterol (Non-HDL)**: 133 mg/dL (6/22/24) to 82 mg/dL (10/26/24)

If I'm reading all of this correctly, I'm really happy with the results! However, I am concerned that my a) triglycerides spiked and b) my HDL went down. I know my triglycerides are still in a normal range, but I'm curious as to why they went up by 40mg/dL. Also, is HDL going down still considered bad or not really an issue?

Thanks for any & all feedback!



**Original Post & if you are interested in the original post's responses, please visit** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1dxn5hy/very_elevated_lpaneed_insight/)**:**

Let me start off my saying that this thread has already been so helpful. Since joining about a week ago, I have scoured posts about low saturated fat diets, Peter Attia (sp?), Lilly clinical trials, etc. I spoke with my doctor about the following questions and was met with a very haulted response in that I don't pose a threat right now. Basically, the phone conversation I had with her left me with feeling like I'm overreacting because I am only 37 and not ""currently"" at risk. I mentioned to her that I have a young child and my mother died young (64, pancreatic cancer) and I am trying to be as proactive (as Kaiser markets themselves and prides themselves as being) as possible. She couldn't get off the phone with me fast enough and was pretty combative with my research based responses, basically saying it without saying it that she was the doctor and this is what they know now. Any advice on the following (doctor's response in parenthesis) is greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.

Stats: 37 year old female, 5'2"", 158 lbs, Teacher (active, but not ACTIVE)

Here goes:

1. Based on my most recent blood test, my cholesterol went from in September 154 to 191 (normal value is <199), my triglycerides went from 76 to 87 (normal value is <149), my HDL went from 48 to 58 (normal value is > 40), my LDL went from 91 to 117 (normal value is <99), my Cholesterol/High Density Lipoprotein went from 3.3 to 3.2 (normal value is <3.9; so relatively the same), and my cholesterol (non-HDL) went from 106 to 133 (nonHDL targets are 30 mg higher than LDL targets; what does that mean)? Can you determine what happened? (She didn't seem to be concerned with this ""spike"" and didn't know what caused it. Thoughts on the above numbers? I did have my thyroid tested test came back normal, so no caused for concern about hypothyroidism)
2. I have been pretty diligent with my 10 mg statin and have been religious with my statin since my lipid panel on 6/22. Would you recommend upping my statin or just retesting in a few months? Are there negative reasons for raising a statin? (She doesn't want to raise my statin at this time, because there can be negative risk factors with upping a statin. She said that 10mg is the ""highest"" for low to moderate risk patients, and because there is no family risk, she wanted to stay put at 10mg).
3. I am interested in possibly taking Ezetimibe with my statin as combination therapy or a PCSK9 inhibitor like Repatha. Do you recommend any low dose aspirin? (She ordered a lipid panel for October, three months from now, and said she would prescribe me Zetia if I wanted to move forward with that at that time; Thoughts?)
4. When is the best time to take my statin for maximum absorption? (She mentioned that since I take Crestor, taking it right before bed is best. She said that taking it with a CoQ10 doesn't mess up absorption, but that I should take CoQ10 before a meal and then my statin before bed and I will be fine).
5. I am very concerned with my Lipoprotein A results. I know that the normal value is <75 and I was shocked to see that my value is 301. From what I understand, this is a result of genetic high cholesterol and from what I understand, there is currently no medication to lower lipoprotein a levels, but that you need to maintain a low LDL and basically take care of everything else to minimize your risk of strokes, heart attacks, etc. (This is where she got pretty combatative with me and frustrated and explained that is why this test is not normally done because the information just basically becomes an FYI witht much to do with it. I explained to her that I'm an information person and basically having a baseline is helpful to me so that I can do everything in my power to control other factors, since I can't do much about this number. She agreed and said that there are many things in the works right now in terms of how to treat LPa (like what is going on with Lilly and that they just don't know how to move forward right now). This is where she got pretty combatative with information and ""being in the know"" such as a doctor and that she realizes that this information isn't readily available to people outside of the medical field, so she forwarded me this information in regards to LPa levels:

There is limited evidence indicating that Lp(a) lowering reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk (see 'Disease associations' above). Thus, except in very rare cases, we do not target Lp(a) with any therapy known to lower Lp(a). (See 'Next steps' below.) Initial approach — Our initial approach to reducing ASCVD risk in patients with elevated Lp(a) is to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to its target. (See ""Management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease"" and ""Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease"".) Usually this involves treatment with a statin, with or without ezetimibe. Statins increase Lp(a) levels \[58\]. However, the impact of this increase on cardiovascular events is not known and is felt to be small \[42,59\]. Ezetimibe does not lower Lp(a). Some patients who cannot achieve an optimal LDL-C with statin plus ezetimibe are treated with a PCSK9 inhibitor. In the FOURIER trial, Lp(a) reduction observed with PCSK9 inhibitor therapy was associated with ASCVD risk reduction independent of LDL-C lowering, as discussed below \[41\]. Thus, very high-risk patients with high Lp(a) levels may benefit disproportionately from a lipid-lowering strategy that includes a PCSK9 inhibitor. In a post-hoc analysis of ODYSSEY outcomes, participants with LDL-C levels between 55 mg/dL and <70 mg/dL with a Lp(a) level above the median of 13.6 mg/dL had fewer cardiovascular disease events on treatment with alirocumab \[60\]. Next steps — For patients with elevated Lp(a) who have reached their LDL-C target or who have received all recommended therapies to lower LDL-C, we await definitive evidence from ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trials with selective Lp(a)-lowering therapies and do not have any broader recommendations on Lp(a) lowering. The use of these therapies in this setting has not been proven in prospectively designed clinical outcome trials. In addition, there are costs to these therapies.

6. Do statins raise lipoprotein a levels? (She said she didn't know; that there are mixed results in this, but basically I am not a candidate who truly ""can't"" take a statin, so the benefits outweight the costs)

7. My goal is to get my LDL below 40 (need to go down 77 points) and keep my HDL above 45. I would like to test my ApoB (that should be in the 40s). How long would it take to get my LDL down to 40-what extreme measures do I need to do? (She said that it's possible to get my LDL down as close to 40, but that it is really hard to do and would account for a ""pretty miserable life"" and that she ""wasn't sure how I would feel with an LDL that low"" since our body needs some cholesterol to function. She said that testing for ApoB is mute at this point (in the similar vein to testing for LPa) since it's just FYI information and then what do I do with it if the range is out of normal, when the only current response is to treat with a statin, which I'm doing. She said that the ""extreme measure"" I could do at this time is to become plant based with my diet)

8. I would like to meet with a cardiologist, and a lipidologist and endocrinologist, if possible. (She didn't respond to the need to meet with a lipidologist or endocrinologist (I'm not sure if this is possible through Kaiser), but did put in a referral for a cardiologist, with obvious hesitation, as she thinks the referral will get bounced back. I mentioned that aren't a risk patient due to my numbers, and was met with a similar response that because my risk is currently low, with an assumption that cardiologists are dealing with more severe cases and there isn't much availability. She put in the referral and said that if it gets bounced back, that I would have to go through member services and make an appointment on my own, if it is okayed. \*\*This is where my major frustration is coming from. I don't feel like my situation should be diluted solely based on the severity of what other people are going through. This is apples and oranges and I am trying to be proactive. I wil absolutely be following up with the cardiologist referral and next steps.""""

9. I would like to schedule a CAC, an APoB test, and an APoA test. Would you recommend that I have a CIMT (carotid intima-media thickness) or angiogram to see my plaque levels? I know it may show 0, but wouldn't it be smart to have a baseline? (She said that the CAC is a test she can't put a referral in for, but that the cardiologist would have to do that. She seemed to skate over ordering the APoB and APoa test, but I am sure her response will be that it is just ""more information"" that I just can do nothing about. I plan on asking my hopefully referred cardiologists about all of these tests)

10. Should I be paying attention to Hs-CRP (inflammation), LP-PLA2 (enzyme to measure plaque activity), hba1c (blood sugar)? (I didn't ask her this question, but was wondering if any of you have any insight on monitoring any of these?)

11. I've also heard that Niacin and/or CoQ10 can be helpful in lowering LDL (and possibly lipoprotein a). I've started taking 100 mgs of Coq10 and 3 tsps daily of Metamucil as a soluble fiber, since I know both of these things can help with lowering LDL. Should I continue CoQ10 & Metamucil? Would you also recommend taking Niacin and/or Fish Oil or any omegas? Keep with Metamucil or straight psyllium husk? Can psyllium husk affect the absorption of my statins? (She said that taking Niacin with me already being on a statin is not necessary nor recommended, due to the risks that niacin can cause. She said takign CoQ10 is smart since LDL can mess with the CoQ10 levels in our body and taking it as a supplement helps with that. She didn't speak it to possibly lowering my LPa, though. She said taking Metamucil is great and that upping fiber in my diet is really smart. She said that Fish Oil has been pretty controversial and that it is actually showing some signs of being harmful (or not helpful) for people in my situation. She said that Metamucil of straight psyllium husk is fine and that psyllium husk does not affect the absoption of my statins)

12. I've also read that a plant based diet is basically smart for someone in my situation. Would you recommend that I become a vegetarian, as well as avoiding cheese and eggs? Or just a low-carb diet? Should I be avoiding alcohol entirely? What is the recommended % of saturated fats that I should be staying under daily-less than 10mg?? Effects of coffee? Should I be intermittent fasting? I know that diet and exercise won't affect the lipoprotein a, but it seems like I might need an extreme lifestyle change to really get my bad cholesterol levels as low as possible to help combat the lipoprotein a levels I can't do much about. (She confirmed that if my goal is lower my rish of cardiovascular disease as much as possible, that switching to a plant-based diet and avoiding as much animal biproducts as possible is a must. She recommended avoiding cheed and eggs, but didn't mention anything about going low carb. In terms of alcohol, she laughed in the fact that, ""Samantha! You're 37 years old! You can have a drink two a party and not worry about it!"" basically contributing to the notion that she ""said it without saying it"" that I am overreacting, and I really do not feel like I am. She confirmed that getting daily saturated fats down to 10mg a day is ideal, but really hard to do and that the best way to keep it as low as possible is with going plant based. She said that coffee is good for you and that it's what we put in coffee that messes things up. I told her I have my coffee with stevia drops and oatmilk and she said that is fine. She said that intermittent fasting is controversial and that she would not recommend.)

13. Are there any clinical trials available for people with my similar results? (She said that she is sure there are clinical trials but that she was unaware of them and it isn't her wheelhouse or recommendation).

WHEW! So, that is a summary sentence of the phone conversation. I am left with an action plan of: 1) another lipid panel in October 2024 2) keeping my statin at 10mg 3) going plant based in my diet 4) put in a refferal for a cardiologist. I feel like ""switching doctors"" within Kaiser will just provide me with another doctor in the network with the same response. Any other suggestions for me at this time?

I've also been taking down some notes with the beneficial information from this feed. I am aware of this website [https://www.lpaclinicalguidance.com/](https://www.lpaclinicalguidance.com/) \~and find myself focusing on the following exercise and diet notes. Any other suggestions or comments are greatly appreciated:\~

1gdr0b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gdr0b9/i_am_just_so_confused/,i am just so confused,"for a while over the summer i was going to the same gym, and i kept seeing this VERY cute guy. lo and behold, he worked there. at the end of the summer, i moved across the city, so i cancelled my membership and on the last day, i gave him my number. he was very sweet and i was just in awe that he had noticed me at all (i have an “ugly dyke” complex from growing up queer, but i am attracted to men and i’m always a little surprised when they reciprocate, especially someone as beautiful as him).

soooo some things were weird off the bat. the day of our first date, he didn’t confirm with me where it was until 3 hours before we met up. not only that, he didn’t give me a specific enough location, and i ended up going to the wrong place. but, he came to me, and we talked for hours. i was so entranced. we barely touched, but at the end, he gave me a hug.

the next few dates were good––difficult life circumstances aside, i.e. a bedbug infestation in my apartment––but he NEVER texted me in between. maybe a couple times. i don’t need to chat, but i really like to have an idea of what the plan is. moreover, i’m usually a pretty busy person, so it’s hard for me when things are up in the air. still, i was willing to compromise for him because i liked him a lot and i figured it might just be because it’s early in the game or whatever. on the third date, i asked what he was looking for and he told me he couldn’t do anything serious right now. he asked what i was looking for and i said i really wanted to see where this went, and he said he agreed? sooo that was confusing, but i let it slide because i was hopeful, and he had said a couple things about seeing me in the winter, etc etc that made me think the prospects were good.

then he cancelled a date the day of, literally 11 minutes after we were supposed to meet up. whatever, it had been sort of a last minute plan and he had an understandable reason. 

then he was TWO HOURS LATE to the next date. i told him it was fine and i understood why (he lives quite a ways away and drives to see me every time, but also he drives into the city to go to work and school so it’s not like he doesn’t know how to get to places on time). on that date, he told me he really wanted to be my person, he just wasn’t sure if he could. i asked what we were doing then, and he said he didn’t know and to take it a couple weeks at a time. i knew i was already in too deep, but the way he spoke to me, looked at me, touched me––i mean, he was giving me the same energy that i was giving him. it seemed like he liked me a lot and maybe just was nervous––he told me he “didn’t want to get dependent on me, which he could easily see happening, even though he really wanted to be my person”. we had great conversations about life and philosophy and art. he seemed genuinely interested in me and the things i had to say, the ideas i had. he even opened up to me a little, which i could tell was difficult for him. 

well, then we spent his birthday together––he was an hour late to that and we ended up rescheduling dinner, but it was his birthday so i couldn’t really get mad. i asked if he’d just be late every time and he said yes, so i was fine with that. and then i saw him again that week and we had a really amazing date. we went to the woods and we kissed so passionately that i started to cry. he asked if he could call me mine. 

at this point, i was thinking about him all the time. my life has been really shit lately (chronic health problems, family and friend drama, aforementioned bed bug infestation, etc) and this was just sorta one good thing that i looked forward to every week. but then, after that really good date, he didn’t text me all week. i had mostly gotten used to it, but we had planned to get coffee and he never confirmed. i was invited to a party the night before but i decided not to go because we were getting coffee early and i need a lot of sleep and i was so excited to see him honestly i just wanted to go home and sleep so i could wake up and see him sooner. the morning of, i texted to see if we were still getting coffee (this was like the fourth text i had sent) and he liked it, then asked if we could move the time back slightly, which i had expected. 

but then, he asked if we could actually move it to next week as he’d been invited to a party on campus that night. i was pissed. i told him that i had moved things around to be able to see him (true), that i had been looking forward to it all week, that the fact that he hadn’t texted me all week and when he finally did it was to cancel on me didn’t feel good, that he was disrespecting my time. he said he heard me and he was sorry. i told him if i wasn’t seeing him today, i needed to think about if i wanted to see him again at all. he told me he understood, that he wanted to see me again but he was being unreasonable and thought some time to think made sense. i said if he really wanted to see me again he should probably pick me up and take me out to coffee (the original plan which he had confirmed not even 30 minutes before). he said “that’s crazy” then told me all the things he liked about me and how he’s happy to be around but “that just seems like too much.” i was SHOCKED. i apologized for being sooooo crazy and expecting him to follow through with our plans. i told him i really liked him, and i said goodbye. he responded to the first message saying “how dare you” (i interpreted this as facetious). to the second one he said, “sorry for getting scared.”

scared?? i was confused. i said if that’s what this was about we could talk about it, but he didn’t answer. so i told him i thought he was wonderful but i guess he isn’t ready for how i feel about him and that’s okay, that i wish good things for him. then i sent him a poem i was going to give him on our date (i had given him a few up until this point and he always said he liked them), because tbh sitting on it would’ve driven me more crazy. he never answered me.

i am just so confused. i thought we had something. i do still think that we had something. i want to talk to him, to find out what happened. did i do something wrong? did he just not like me? was it all a facade? or was he really just scared, was it getting too real for him? or is he just an asshole who has never had anyone put their foot down around him? does he want someone with no self respect, or who just doesn’t like him that much? i am heartbroken over this––i know it was early, but i seriously saw a future with this guy. and now he’s just gone, like a ghost. i guess i always know where he works… lol. but yeah. i guess i’d just like some insight, or some thoughts, or just some words of encouragement so i can move on. kill my hope that he will text me telling me he messed up and he wants to make it right! kill it!",1,1730079840.0,dating,1,1.0,False

1gdqyd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1gdqyd4/is_gerd_curable/,Is GERD Curable?,"So I've been taking testosterone injections for a few weeks now and have began developing pretty uncomfortable GERD symptoms including constant burping, neverending bloating, and indigestion.

  
These symptoms among others started a few weeks ago, and originaly I thought it might be lactose intolerance, then IBS, but in the past few days I stumbled across more online ""research"" now I'm very confident it is GERD.  I've started taking otc antacids like Tums. 

  
I've been really worried because I'm not sure if it's reversible. There's a bunch of factors that probably made my symtpoms worse, like eating a LOT junk for the past week or two (guilty pleasures), when I usually eat 90% healthy. Also was consuming caffeine, not daily but I did start my day with coffee on an empty stomach a few times in the past 2-3 weeks.. That always caused a lot of acidity and a weird stomach feeling but I've done it dozens of times (now feeling really stupid for it)

Upon my research I've become fairly confident that my GERD came to be due to the testosterone, but I'm sure my other habits have made it worse. I'm not going to take any more  testoserone (until we can rule it out or find a work around) and I plan on going to a doctor very soon, but I'm just wondering is it possible that GERD can temporary and can be cured . Say if testosterone is definitely the culprit, and I go off, will GERD have a chance stop? Or did I wreck my system for life over a few dumb decisions?

In 2021 I followed my symptoms down the road and it all pointed to low testosterone. I got my levels checked though they didn't check free testosterone. I had a 768 level, doctor said ""you're fine"" and so on went life. I did note though that my albumin level was 5.1 at the time which I know has relation to free testosterone along with SHBG though they didn't test that. 

I have an appointment tomorrow with a men's doctor and am trying to figure out what's going on with my body. I am active, I eat well, I get sunlight, drink water, take vitamins (zinc, b12-k2, magnesium, vitamin d & lysine). I do use nicotine pouches for the last year though was nicotine free for years prior to that with symptoms remaining the same. 

I have no sex drive. I couldn't tell you the last time I had a random erection. With that I have struggled with ED with partners for many years. 

My sleep is awful and not for lack of trying. I'm up minimum 5 times throughout the night each night if I don't drink nyquil which I try to use seldom and only for ""I need sleep or I'm not going to be okay"" times. 

I have virtually no body hair- only at 29 have I started to get a few little chest hairs and grow facial hair which takes an incredible amount of time to grow at all. 

I would describe things as depression though I've experienced true depression and this isn't like that. This has been an overarching theme of life different from clinical depression whereas I have no drive. If it wasn't for the fear of not being able to afford to live or getting overweight, I'd be surprised if I got off the couch or did any strenuous/ challenging activity. 

I've been having strange mood swings or general anxiety for as long as I can remember. 

I feel constantly fatigued. I take naps regularly which has gotten worse in the last year or so. If I go through an average day or work it feels like it takes 2 days to recover from it. Without naps I'd be screwed. I also realize this may be correlated to my sleep troubles though even on the rare nights I do get good sleep, there's an overlying fatigue constantly. I don't consume any energy drinks and drink 24oz coffee daily, water & seltzer waters. 

I eat primarily red meat with vegetables for lunch and dinner along with local honey & a banana for breakfast each day. 

I thought all men lived like this and felt like hell and I'm just learning that that is not the case. I just want to feel normal. 

When I was a teenager I was a drug addict for years and had a 6 month stint where I used as much methamphetamine as I could ingest before going catatonic. I know that that plays a role in your endocrine system and as such I wonder how much damage I had done to mine. I've now been clean for almost 12 years. 

  
I'm hoping that this doctor is able to provide some insight but I'm curious if anyone else has experienced similar symptoms in a similar situation. I know everybody and every body is different. Assuming I have normal ""Total"" testosterone ranges is it possible that I have low bioavailable testosterone which could be causing these long term symptoms?

I've been in a relationship for about 18 months with an amazing girl whom I care for deeply. However, we've been disagreeing more frequently on certain topics, like politics and some other ideals on raising kids, etc… which has started to bother me.

Recently, I've found myself thinking a lot about an ex-girlfriend from before this relationship. I never told her I loved her at the time, but I've come to realize that I did, and now I feel she might be the one that got away. I think about her often, especially since she moved away, and I’m struggling with the idea of reaching out for closure.

There’s an added complication: she may have a boyfriend now, and I definitely don’t want to jeopardize my current relationship. However, I sometimes feel that meeting for coffee might help me find the clarity I need.

I’m torn between the love I have for my current girlfriend and the unresolved feelings for my ex. 

I truly have not been able to shake the thought of her from my mind. Should I reach out for closure, or should I focus on my current relationship?

I know I know… this is probably a bit juvenile. It’s just the first time I’ve felt this…

1gdqrmv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gdqrmv,Bike setup updates ,"I wanted to share some learnings from changes I made to my bike for the Kings Road Cross-Florida race this weekend (205mi). This is my bikepacking bike minus the camping bags under the bars and saddle because we rode it straight through.  The route is majority off-road, mixed between gravel, limestone and sand.  The third pic is before the changes, the other two pics are after

1) Redshift dual position seat post - love it.  It gives me two different bike fits for changing positions when I'm really fatigued.  It also solved a big problem I had with my HR going up 5-10 bpm when I got into my aero bars.  They were mounted on a Fred bar (before pic) which would close my hip angle too much.  Now I just flip the saddle forward to get into a TT position and it works great
 
2) Redshift suspension stem: love it, it eats up bumps and lets me go much faster on chunky gravel.  The Fred bar I was using is incompatible with a suspension stem but the dual position seat post allowed me to delete it and use this stem

3) top tube water bottle - undecided.  I run a 3L apidura bladder (love it) in the lower triangle of my frame bag.  I want to run a separate bottle for other beverages (e.g. coffee) and as a backup in case the bladder springs a leak.  I didn't find the top tube bottle rubbing my legs very much, no sores.  But in the back of my head I'm worried that it changes how I'm riding and stresses my knees.  It wasn't a problem over this distance 

4) 3D printed saddle - hate it.  I like the one on my road bike but I think it's the wrong choice for this distance.  The saddle surface is grippy so the mesh turns into a bit of a cheese grater and by mile 150 I was fresh out of ass meat for it to chew on.  I was previously using a brooks C17 which had a smooth surface but it was sagging and causing other problems.  Need to keep looking.

Details:  
Stayed one night recently at the Residence Inn in Saddle River, NJ. The room was ... adequate. Fairly worn, a little dated. But everything worked, and it was clean.

Swung by the included breakfast in the lobby, and holy moly, what a shit show!!

Toaster: ""Out of Order""  
Waffle maker: ""Out of Order""  
Coffee: Not refilled  
Milk: Missing  
Spoons: Not replenished  
Tables: Not wiped down or cleaned  
Dirty dishes & silverware: No place to put them (eg cart, plastic tub - nothing). They were just piling up on the counter near the door.  
Staff: Nowhere to be seen.

I know that guests can be slobs, and they don't always leave their table clean, etc., and maybe that was partly the case here. But the service and basic amenities were totally lacking/non-existent.

Overheard from rando woman, to nobody in particular: ""This is the worst hotel I've stayed at, ever."" Rando dude, in response,""You took the words out of my mouth.""

When I checked out a little later, I mentioned to the front desk guy that the breakfast was really unsatisfactory. He was unkempt and unprofessional, and had an attitude. He sarcastically said, ""The person in charge will be fired immediately."" I said, ""No, seriously, it's not up to an acceptable level for the standard your brand maintains."" He mumbled something about ""doing the best they can,"" but he copped attitude and wasn't at all appropriate.

1gdqqeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/surrendered_wife/comments/1gdqqeb/change_literally_within_a_week_why_didnt_i_do/,Change literally within a week! Why didn't I do this earlier!?,"Hi everyone, first post here. My friend introduced me to the EW when I told her about my relationship struggles about 6 months ago. Initially I gave it a read, but like many others thought it was absolutely ridiculous and stopped. Then the other day, we happened to chat about my issues again and she encouraged me to look into the EW again as it has really worked for her marriage. 

So I did, and some of the advice started to click once I put aside my initial impression. Just to add, I am not a Christian at all, but I thought I would give the principles a go because it was worth a try, minus the 'faith' one obviously. I wanted to talk about it here with some more women who are part of this group, so this post is a bit long-winded!

A lot of her points make total sense, I don't know why it never came to me before? I didn't realise what respect was to men, my boyfriend would sometimes say to me that he has never felt so disrespected, especially after we had an incident a couple of months ago where I disregarded his wishes. He would ask me how I show him I appreciated him...  I would say well I cook and clean for you! And he would say... well you would have to do that for yourself regardless of whether I'm around or not. I just couldn't understand why he thought I didn't appreciate him.

I would also try to control situations a lot, for example he would just simply share with me his 'aspirations' to one day own a vintage car that I honestly think is a waste of money, I would be honest and tell him in an attempt to control the situation, which left him feeling unsupported and I guess turned it into a mother/child situation too.

Another thing I'm terribly guilty of, is asking if we can do something. ""Can we go out for breakfast tomorrow morning?"" He would get so frustrated, and ask me why I am asking him. He himself would tell me that he wants me to have more independence and just tell him what I want instead of asking for permission. I just didn't realise the damage I was doing there.

I've just never thought about how my reactions impact him! I feel embarrassed now. He is actually capable of being his own human, he is a well educated, rational guy. He has a successful career and handles his money very well, but alot of my actions in our relationship pointed out the fact that I don't trust him. 

We would get into arguments ALL THE TIME. He would often say that I'm assuming the worst intent from him. And it's true, I would assume that he doesn't want to help me, or said things to hurt me. I made myself the victim. But changing my perspective to listen to his HM makes way more sense. Why do I put myself through this turmoil? Then expect him to console me to make me feel better?

So I've implemented some changes over this past week, and they are already working! It's literally changed things overnight. 
- I told him I wanted these really nice bedding sets online... he hands me his credit card and told me to get them. Instead of disagreeing like i normally would, I accepted the gift and said thank you and told him I appreciated him.
- We had a discussion about what we were doing next week on our days off, before I would've kept asking what he wanted to do in an attempt to control, but I said ""whatever you think"" and walked away. He seemed pleasantly surprised that I'd just left it at that!
- I told him I can't do all the housework anymore. It's too much with both of our jobs and has honestly been a point of contention for us for awhile. He is going to pay for a cleaner to come to the house fortnightly. 
- I wouldn't respect him to be honest! He is an early riser, I'm a late owl. I would always get upset when he wanted to go to bed early and try to get him to stay up longer. He found this really upsetting as he needs sleep to function, and I didn't understand how I was being disrespectful 'wanting to spend more time together' but I get it now.
- I have upped my self-care to at least 2 things a day. I go to the gym or for a walk most days and go out for coffee with a friend, I think he's appreciating my ability to have my own hobbies where as before I'd want to spend all our time together. 
- If there's something that I know will make him happy, I just do it. If I don't understand it but it makes no difference to my life if I do it or not, I don't ask why, I just do it. It's not worth the effort arguing back. 
- Intrinsically I've just been trying harder to trust him and his decisions. I've honestly not shown much trust in him before, purely just because of my anxious attachment and my need to control everything, and he knew that which really caused a lot of our issues. 

I really think all of my negative perspectives towards trust and respect, and my need to control situations have really impacted our relationship before this point. We would have fights multiple times a week, and they would be really nasty tit-for-tat kind of fights that make everything tense for days on end. We were both miserable and questioning whether this relationship was working.

Like I said, it's only been a week but I am already seeing huge improvements. He seems way happier, we are holding hands in public, he's being  more affectionate/cuddly at home. We haven't had a single fight in a whole week, which is (sadly) amazing for us. I just feel happier and lighter. Like I don't have this resentment weighing on my shoulders that I did before. I was almost choosing to be unhappy, which is crazy. It's insane that just changing my perspective/language is so simple yet so effective.

I have no idea what’s going on with my four month old and I just need her to stop crying. She’s been a tough baby from the jump and we have been experimenting with so many different things, but perhaps, not long enough.

Backstory. Baby EBF from the jump but having forceful spit up/lots of crying and colic like symptoms. I supplemented a few times with Bobbie as I was working on my milk supply. Weeks 5-9 were pure hell with the constant screaming. She is a breath holder as well and would sometimes hold her breath for 5 or more seconds/turn purple. It was weird bc it was an every other day thing. There was no consistency to where we could pin point a cause to the crying. 
We tried reflux meds but didn’t notice a difference. Same with biogaia probiotics. Gas drops seem to piss her off even more. 

I had this constant fear that I was eating something that was hurting her. Doctor gave us 5 cans of Alimentum to trial while I eliminated dairy from my diet. She seemed better on day one but I stopped day two because she got sick so I wanted to give her antibodies with my breast milk. She seemed ok, so I just assumed it must not be dairy and never used the formula again (bc the smell too…oooooffff). Since then, she gets exclusive breast milk, but we have used kendamil off and on anywhere from 1-6 oz per day. 

Well, here we are at four months old and the screaming….oh, the screaming. I had a moment today while I was holding her at my friends house and I was crying as she was screaming bc I just need her to stop screaming. It’s every few hours. Every day. We are really dialing in and trying to find a pattern and we can’t. She seems to scream cry when she’s tired/before most naps. Which coincides with eating about 30 mins-1.5 hours before. So, it’s hard to say if it’s from eating or from over tired. 

Sleeps a six hour stretch before waking to eat, then goes back down again for another 4 ish hours. 

Is it possible she has some sort of intolerance to something I’m eating?! Should I give hypoallergenic another go? I asked my doctor about trying a gentle formula and he said that a gentle formula would likely be the equivalent of the amount of dairy that would be passed thru breast milk, which is why he recommended the hypo. I barely even eat dairy. I just have some in my coffee and maybe some cheese here and there, but know it’s hidden in a lot of products.

We are at a total loss and I am slowly deteriorating. We have her doctor appt this week and was wondering if there are any questions I should be asking.  

Symptoms: sometimes sounds congested when not sick, wet burps, CONSTANT screaming, used to forcefully vomit (outgrew that tho), sometimes has mucus in stool, but not daily, arches/stiffens when crying, and won’t nap during the day longer than 30 mins unless held.

I recently had a few months of paternity leave and took care of my young son which was amazing.

Hotel, tour guides, food, coffee, tailor, events?  I tried for useful details! lol","Hi all!  I did look through a bunch of posts the last few days but I figured no harm in asking here since it seems a lot of people don't give many details when looking for recs.

Male (40) going to Bangkok for the last two weeks of next month with my girlfriend (35). Leaving from the US.

I'm looking for any suggestions on a few things:  
1) Hotel.  Budget about $100-low $200's/night (3500-7000 THB).  Wishlist is:  room with a desk with docking station/good internet/monitors since I'll have to work a bit.  5 star.  Bonus for good food/bar in it, good massage/spa facilities and nice bathrooms.  (Big tub or soaking tub with jets etc).    
So far Shangril-La, COMO Metropolitan, and SO/ Bangkok looked good but also I don't know what I don't know?

2) Guide?  Wondering if it's worth it to get a personal tour guide for the first day or two just to show us around as we direct (IE: this type of food, that type of store, etc)?  I've seen a lot of scammy places/experiences listed here.  Looking for a service that's reputable, obviously hopefully speaks some english, $50-150 (1500-4500 THB) /day range?  Any recommendations on solid/trustworthy places?  I saw one place that does tours of different street food that looked cool maybe?

3) Food.  She's a foodie, preferences for seafood, and funky flavor combinations so I think she'll be in heaven.  She's big on ""whatever is the local specialty/style"", very adventurous palette.  I really don't care either way.  Looking for 1 very high end place to go to for a fantastic meal. Maybe one of the Michelin star places?  Open to suggestions.  Or any hidden gems!  open on the price range. Maybe $150 (3000-4500 THB) /person for the fancy night.  Whatever for any others.

4)Coffee/tea.  She also loves coffee/tea so any recommendations of tea houses, cafes, etc that have good quality, nice experiences, tastings, etc that you'd suggest?

  
5)  Tailor:  Ok I've mostly given up on this because there are SOOOO many threads and it's hard to tell what's legit and what's covert advertising.  Looking for a place to get custom suits. Ideally fairly modern, single breasted, good quality fabric, wool preferably maybe linen as well.  $100-$300 USD (3500-10,000 THB) price range.  
OK with going in for multiple fittings.  Ideally a place that can keep measurements on file to order online after I leave in the future.  More concerned with a place that I can trust quality of the fabric and cut.  Don't need anything too flashy/unique.  Just solid nice business wear single breasted suits.

6) OPEN:  Events? Bars? Shows? Places I need to visit?  
Me:  Loves cats.  fairly gothy.  Fairly introverted.  Enjoy reading, cafes, people watching, etc.    
GF loves anime, most styles of art, tattooing (is a tattoo artist), horror, fashion, performances, tea, kink/shibari related things  
Anything that you think would fit some of that is welcome.

7) Random Items:   
\- We will probably hit Nana plaza and/or Soi Cowboy but not really focusing on that type of tourism  
\- I vape.  Easy to do around? Any issues/concerns?  
\- Esim - get it and load it before I leave the airport in the states or easy to get at the airport/mall there? Recs? so far I was thinking [https://www.ais.th/travellersim/](https://www.ais.th/travellersim/) from a rec I saw here.  
\- Taxis? Tuktuks? from airport or just around? Thoughts/suggestions? Grab a good thing to lean on for this?

So far got this for good advice:  
\- pack light and buy light linen/cotton stuff there since I'll melt in most of my owned-wardrobe.  (any recommended places for just basic light clothing?  Figure this should be pretty easy to find though)  
\- See the palace.  Cover shoulders/knees.  
\- get Eatigo and Hungry Hub for food  
\- Chatuchak weekend market  
\- China town (GF is chinese)  


Might go for a few days to a beach/resort somewhere, still looking into that but that's another whole thread and I haven't researched that much yet.

Could you please help me find an anime, or maybe the specific episode of it? I want to rewatch an anime that I watched when I was a kid, I think it's about 10 years ago or so.

There's one scene where the MC (boy/probably high school) got kidnapped and trapped in the culprit's basement. The culprit always gave him food and drink so he could survive, but the MC found out that he wasn't the first victim of the culprit by finding a memo written by the previous victim. The note told the MC how he could escape - it's by NOT eating the food given by the culprit. Instead, the MC should've eaten stones to satisfy his hunger. (After that, I don't remember what happened.)

Then there's one more scene where there are 5-6 people sitting together at one table, served with coffee. There is a culprit who wanted to poison one of those people by poisoning his/her coffee. But before all the people could drink, the MC told them to move to another room. After that, the MC (I guess it's the MC) disguised himself as an office boy and served back the 5-6 coffees (not sure if it's coffee or not, but probably yes) to the 5-6 people randomly (or the culprit thought so). Because the coffee was randomly served, the poisoned one was unknown, so the culprit waited and watched all the people drink their coffee. It turned out the poisoned coffee was in front of the culprit (this was cool, haha).

That's all that I could remember. If you somehow know this anime, please tell me what it is. The genre should be similar to Detective Conan / Case Closed.

1gdqdb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gdqdb8/nazi_connection/,NAZI Connection ,"      For the last 30 years this has wade heavy on my conscience. My wife and I had only been married about 6 months when she had gotten a job at a car dealership in the service dept. as a secretary.
      She had a female boss that was about 10 years older than us. After a few months of being employed there they had got to be decent friends but not really that close because of personality differences. Me and my wife came from a very isolated part of the country and we were not really knowledgeable about the world and history because limited information in small home town. We got limited television and sources of reading literature. Germany during WW2 was not really that interesting to a teenager in the 80s. 
        We were invited to her boss’s house one evening for dinner. We accepted and showed up and were given the grand tour of the house before dinner. We saw old antique furniture and figurines throughout the first floor of the house. They explained they were of German origin and they did look really old and well made.
         We ate dinner and  afterwords began small talk about where we came from and how simple our upbringing was in the small mountain town we came from. They seemed to glance at one another throughout our conversation as we sat there and drank coffee. 
           The husband suddenly said we would like to share our families history so they asked us to follow them to the basement floor of the house. As we made our way down the narrow steps to the basement it opened up to a din like room where the center piece of the room was a large gold NAZI flag stand with the flag hanging from the top. I didn’t know if it was real but definitely looked and smelled old. There was a lamp on the table that they explained was made from human skin. I remember the light in the shade was not very bright but light and dark spots were visible as it was thicker in some areas and thinner in others. There was a book in German that they said was bound in human skin. It was laying on the table beside the lamp. They brought out a box from the closet or side room I don’t really remember but at the time I think we were both in shock at this point. It contained buttons and pendants they ware supposedly made from human bones. We saw medals, pins and other badges of German origin. 
         We left that night kinda baffled about what we saw but really didn’t understand the full impact of what these items stood for till years later. My wife only worked there a few more months. This happened around 1988. I have googled the lamp and the book binds years later and have found that this was not very common and isolated to one concentration camp during WW 2.
           I read somewhere that one of the lamps was recovered in New Orleans after the hurricane. If anyone has ever came across the items or has information on any of these items, please share.

1gdq8vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Barnesandnoble/comments/1gdq8vz/bruh_really_a_vent/,Bruh. Really? (A Vent),"Today has been A Day. I know to expect that, given how Sundays always seem to be particularly frantic days. But today just seemed to throw particular obstacles our way besides the usual.

I have basically been the store bicycle the last few shifts, being of service to any and all sections and tasks in trained for. But for the most part, due to callouts and family emergencies, it’s been mainly backing up cafe. Sometimes for nearly my entire shift. I don’t mind this; my ADHD self enjoys having something to do with my hands constantly and I like helping out. The problem is the pressure to sell Hot Coffee, Hot Books.

I don’t know how unpopular I’m about to become, but I can sooner find appeal in BOtM than I can with the types of HCHBs corporate picks. Probably because they always seem to be YA or horror, which kind of puts an even stronger limit on how easily and often we can sell them. But lately our SM and cafe lead have been really trying to hype up selling them, down to even promising free pizza if we sell 100.

At any rate, before I even clocked in, my SM confirmed with me that I would be working cafe, he threw in yet another “They haven’t gotten on the board yet with HCHB, try and see if you can get us on there while you’re over there.” As he now does every time I am scheduled to be in cafe.

He is not cafe-trained, so I don’t think he completely understands how busy we actually get on Sundays; sorry but I can only promise to try, but that book isn’t one of my priorities if I’m being totally honest. Not unless someone actually seems interested.

Anyways. As you can imagine, today was a show of the crap variety. When things had seemingly calmed down in the cafe, my two barista coworkers gave me the okay to go on bookfloor unless they needed backup. Eventually one of them went to lunch and about five minutes after, as I was backing up cashwrap, the line barista is on headset lowkey frantically asking for a backup because a whipped cream canister had a busted gasket or something and exploded. Whipped cream everywhere.

I had to sprint over and back him up while he tried to mop up the mess. I left to grab something from the freezer for 30 seconds at most and come back to find him wobbily standing up. Dude slipped and fell in the moppy whipped cream mess!

Had to call for any and all backup because customers were still coming and making a line. The good news was, the two who could come are also cafe-trained. The bad news is, this meant there were only three other people on the bookfloor, including the SM and a keyholder. We were dreadfully understaffed because of course we are!

We had to make the guy who fell sit his ass down while one of us cleaned, the other manned the register, and the third made the drinks. If you want a visual of how we had to move on the wet floor, imagine how SpongeBob tried to bring the Krabby Patty over to Squidward when he’d forgotten how to tie his shoelaces. I’m 29, if I fall down it’s over for me.

Jokes aside, it was very stressful trying to do a mini-rush. Even more stressful when even 15 minutes later, we were still trying to clean and dry the floors because it was getting too dangerous. Yet the SM was on the headset constantly asking if we were done, if the other two booksellers could come back to the floor.

Dude. We get it but also?? Justin (not real name) fell, other bro is on lunch, we have a bit of a line here, and it’s taking longer to make stuff because we can’t zip around without risking death in front of the customers!!

But perhaps the most frustrating part of it all? Once everything finally did calm down, what do I hear on the headset?

“Let’s see if we can try and get a HCHB this next hour. Please and thank you.”


TL;DR - We were understaffed and dealing with excessive levels of Sunday when a whipped cream canister exploded, splattered its contents everywhere, my coworker slipped and fell so I needed backup in the cafe. And through all of that, the focus was still on trying to sell a Hot Coffee, Hot Book.

I feel super resentful towards my brother in law and idk what to do

Should I talk to my sister about my worries?

Me 23F sister 25F bil 30M

me and my sister have always been best friends and talked about our hopes and dreams for the future and one of my sisters dreams was to fall in love, at 19 she met the love of her life and I was so happy for her.

I got to know bil like he was a brother and I really liked him, even though there were some things we didn’t agree on, he was really nice and he treats my sister like a queen so I was happy. Heather was especially good with my sisters health as she can struggle with it.

when they met my sister was an artsy hipster type who loved to hang at coffee shops and art galleries she also adored old cinema. She would talk to me about her dreams of being a jetsetter, traveling the world and doing all sorts.

When I say things we didn’t agree on I mean some racial stuff and political stuff. I brought it up to my sister at the time but she would always end up falling out with me so i stopped bringing it up.

They got married after 3 years and had a beautiful wedding, things were good and they went traveling around the country we’re from  for their honeymoon because this happened at the end of Covid. And also bil has traveled loads of places and likes our country’s culture like a lot.

Anyway catching up to the present and why I’m writing this post is because I’m really resentful and worried about things my sister tells me or bil does and idk what to do. I’ll give a list of examples that I just feel furious over.

1. She has no financial freedom, she is a stay at home mum and his pay stays in his account, if she wants to buy anything she needs to ask, they don’t have a joint account. She says to me he can be irresponsible with their money and it can leave them really short. But she wants him to feel like he has freedom . Note my sister is fantastic with money, she was the best in my entire family with it including my parents.


2. Her in-laws treat her like shit and he continues to see them and doesn’t stand up for her with them, he’ll only get annoyed and upset about what happened when it’s just my sister and him. He continues to see them and would rather keep seeing them and keep the peace than defend her and disturb the water.


3. He refuses to use contraception or get the snip, even though my sister has given him children and birth control doesn’t agree with her. Also her  childbirth nearly killed her.


4. He’s teaching his toddler homophobia, maybe people will call me woke but not letting your baby play with a rainbow toy or turning off the tv so that he can’t see a man wearing makeup seems ridiculous. He doesn’t let him wear anything he thinks is too “girly” and will rip rainbow toys away from him. It’s just bizarre to me and I think it really teaches intolerant behaviour.

5. Travel, they have travelled once abroad, everywhere else has been in our country. My bil has always had pride of our country and wanted to travel it. My sister likes the country bur always talked about going places. It just feels like he has done his traveling already so didn’t feel the need to go anywhere he didn’t want to. So now my sister doesn’t get to either. 

6. Kids, my sister wanted a family and I believe she loves her kids to bits like 1000% but sometime I feel like she sacrificed a bit of herself for my bil like he really wanted kids, he was a bit older than my sister and had done all these achievements and was ready to settle down. I just feel like she didn’t have as much opportunity. For instance with travel or really pushing her businesses or trying again at her studying. Another factor is her health since she was a teen her doctors have advised her that because of her condition having kids will be a lot harder and more painful.

I know this is really personal but I feel like in the last 6 years my sister is so different, where once I could talk to her about anything now I feel I need to filter myself. 
Where once her style was arty and cool it’s now muted.
She used to talk all about her great passions, now she only talks about her kids and her in-laws.
She used to be so open minded and now she’s far more closed.


My heart breaks when she’s holding her baby telling me to keep studying because she didn’t stick at it and now she’s not got anything or when I’m talking about my expats and she’s telling me all about the places she’s always wanted to go.

I want to make it clear, she never complains about bil, she is happy and loves her kids, bil and house.  I just can’t help but feel furious when I come off the phone or visit her and hear about these things or see them in person. I’m good at masking my emotions but for some reason it’s killing me, I think it’s to do with every phone call contains one of the red flags above . 

Please be kind in the comments, I know some of my worries may be unfounded but for some reason it’s tearing me apart.

TL;DR  I feel super resentful towards my brother in law and idk what to do about it

I am going to be in France (Saint Malo) for a week for work next March. The following week is a convenient time for my partner and myself to take time off, so the plan is to meet up in Paris, and take off from there.

  
The overall plan is to take the train from Paris to either Marseille or Barcelona, and then back to Paris to fly out. We would like to spend approximately 2 days in Marseille (or Barcelona) and then 2 days in Paris. On the way South, we would like to make a few stops, each lasting for a day (or maybe two if it is a really cool/cute place).

  
So my question for you is, what are some of the coolest/cutest towns on the rail line between Paris and either Marseille or Barcelona. We are not looking for a place that is jam-packed with tourist activities, but the odd cathedral or castle tour could be cool. I am most interested in seeing things that are unique to that area and that I can't see elsewhere. Some other things that we particularly like: coffee and pastries, old architecture, sleepy towns, beautiful vistas, and hiking.

  
One other question if I can bother you more. How hard is it to get sleeping accommodations in these areas? I ask because I would prefer to leave a lot of flexibility in the schedule. If we find a really cool spot, maybe we stay for another day. However, that would require that we don't have lodging all booked in advance. Is it pretty easy/reliable to show up to a town and find a reasonably priced hotel or hostel?

  
Thanks in advance!",3,1730077345.0,Europetravel,6,1.0,False
1gdq7xd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1gdq7xd/rejected_once_again_feeling_lower_than_ever/,Rejected once again. Feeling lower than ever.,"I think the worst part about the whole thing is that I genuinely thought it was going to work. I mean, I guess I felt the same way about other people, but this time it genuinely just felt *right.* We'd been friends for more than two years before they asked me out. Nobody's ever asked me out in my life. I was totally stunned. At first, I was worried that it'd be awkward, but straight away it was just really comfortable. I felt like I knew exactly what to say, how to make them laugh, what to discuss and interest them. For the first time while dating another person, I didn't have to silence the nervous voice in my head. It was never even there at all.

And the dates were fantastic. Art galleries, coffee together, cooking meals in their kitchen and going around vintage music/bookstores... it's the kind of things I love to do, love to share with people. We got along so well that it makes me feel faint knowing that it'll never happen now. Worse is the fact that I was totally blindsided by the ""I like us better as friends"" bomb. I mean, they asked me out and we had chemistry - a friend of ours commented on it, and more than one person mentioned that we make a great couple. The knowledge that even when someone actually asks me out, when someone chases me after years of me chasing others, it still doesn't take long for them to realise that I'm something in me makes me undesirable as a romantic partner... it hurts so bad. I just wish I *knew* what that thing was, because the constant string of heartbreaks and rejections with nothing to show for it is just getting exhausting.

With other relationships, I've learned things, seen red flags in hindsight, picked myself up and moved on. This time, though, I genuinely don't think I could change anything. In the end, even when you find someone who you've really started falling for, it turns out that you were right about the other shoe waiting to drop all along. It's just agonising being the one on the receiving end of this every single time.

I know I'm going to pick up the pieces and get back up again. Charlie Brown always got back up to run down the hill and kick that football. But maybe I'm realising now that, no matter how much he tried, Charlie Brown never *did* get to kick that football, and maybe there's only so many times you can fall down before realising you might as well stay on your back.",1,1730077318.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to stay active, and exercise daily. 


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

1gdq0za,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/1gdq0za/did_you_know_coffee_dates_and_other_low/,"Did you know coffee dates and other ""low value/effort"" first dates are still in?","Across comment sections on instagram, Tiktok, and some subreddits, especially on that ragebait network Threads, it's easy to find women lambasting men who propose getting drinks as a first date. From the perspective it's because it's not ""high value"" enough.

Equally so, it's somewhat easy to find women that appreciate those kinds of dates, or for the ease of leaving those kinds of dates. But they aren't unilaterally complaining about being invited so you have to post threads like this get that perspective. If you're a guy looking for dates, it's easy for your algorithms to surface that kind of content from women optimizing for phantoms. If you're a woman kind of entertained enough by dating already, your algorithm likely won't show you what disgruntled women say.

In any case, over the last year, myself and my buddies tried doing the ""high value"" first dates, almost exclusively. Basically, quirky date ideas, gifts, and things like that. I did picnics with the big spread and cute picnic basket, brunches at nice restaurants, events, gifts of tiny succulents. My buddies did as well, and pointed out they stopped for the same reasons:

Literally none of that stuff hit. We got the first dates, nice cordial and fun experiences. But not the next

ALL of the second dates, flings and girlfriends of the season occurred from the ""low effort"" outings and invites to a bar or coffee.

Now we're not actually looking for solutions. We don't really really care for it to be psychoanalyzed, or ways how to parlay that energy from the picnic or events towards women ""dating with intention"" or whatever, as if they're actually different women than the ones that accept coffee and drink dates. When we can also just invite women for drinks and people are pretty down for that. Even the women that are lambasting the concept, from what we can tell, most of them are saying aspirational things AFTER they continue to agree to the experience they feel ""undervalued"" by, as opposed to actually rejecting the attention, or unmatching on dating apps or ghosting for that specific reason. One of my buddies is big on dating apps, I don't use dating apps.

Just a couple data points for Los Angeles, has anyone else tried doing something similar with similar results?
