1o3m0wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o3m0wg/aitah_for_cutting_my_best_friend_off_cos_she/,AITAH for cutting my best friend off cos she disrespected my partner and just can‚Äôt be happy for me?,"I cut my best friend off because she just couldn‚Äôt be genuinely happy for me anymore. She would always say things like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll break up anyway, and you‚Äôll come running back to me like before.‚Äù I get that I‚Äôve had bad exes, but I never asked her to constantly ‚Äúpick me up.‚Äù She did that on her own, and I‚Äôve always been grateful. But over time, she started using it against me every time I talked to a new guy.
We‚Äôve been single together for years. Our exes were actually best friends, and when they both broke up with us around the same time, we bonded over it. We were basically inseparable‚Äîlate-night calls, crying in the car, random coffee runs just to vent about how we got played. It used to feel like we had each other‚Äôs backs for life.

Then years later, I met my current partner. He‚Äôs different. He‚Äôs serious, mature, and consistent. He flew all the way to Chicago to meet my dad and even came to the Philippines to meet me and my whole extended family. This month, he surprised me with a plane ticket to California so I could meet some of his relatives too. I feel like if he wasn‚Äôt serious about me, he wouldn‚Äôt go that far.

When he first came to the Philippines, I told my best friend it would mean a lot to me if she could meet him. We adjusted schedules several times just to make it happen, but she kept making excuses. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try next week.‚Äù Then she‚Äôd go out with other people the same day. That hurt.
The part that really broke me, though, was when I found out she was talking to my ex and saying things like I still wanted him back. I never said that. I was already with my current partner, completely over my ex. She tried to stir drama that could‚Äôve easily ruined my relationship. I tried to forgive her, but the trust was gone. So I stopped trying to hold on to a friendship that kept hurting me.
Now I‚Äôm hearing that she‚Äôs been telling people I ‚Äúchose a guy over our friendship.‚Äù I still love her, honestly. There are moments when I miss our friendship‚Äîlike when something funny happens and I still think about sending it to her‚Äîbut I know things can‚Äôt go back to how they were.

AITA for cutting her off? Because I truly believe that if a friend disrespects my man, then they‚Äôre disrespecting me too. Most especially, if they can‚Äôt be happy for me and only wanted me at my worst, then they‚Äôre never really my friend at all.",1,1760155874.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False
1o3m0m3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o3m0m3/aitah_for_setting_my_boundaries_with_my_best/,"AITAH for setting my boundaries with my ""best friend""","My best friend and I have known each other since 2014. Everything was fine and dandy until she started dating my ex. This caused friction, but we eventually worked it out. At one point, my best friend and her boyfriend were arguing often, and I tried to support her. I was always there for her, putting my own life aside. She wanted to be with him, so I helped him plan a marriage proposal. Fortunately, she said yes, and things were fine for a while. When she got pregnant, a lot changed. 

I was going through a difficult time and was depressed. Yet, I always tried to be there for her. The other way around wasn't the case. Her then fianc√© started acting strangely. Required extra attention from me and at one point he started sending nudes on Snapchat. I told her this right away and she said to me that I should ignore it. After I got very angry with him, he apologized and I tried to move on (to save the bond with my best friend). The bond between my best friend and I continued to deteriorate. When her little one was born, I came to help every day and often cleaned the house. However, there never came a time when she actually asked how I was doing. Until the middle of last year. 

He started sending pictures again and every time I told her she responded by telling me to ignore or delete him. No sooner said than done, so I removed him from all socials. I told my best friend that I didn't want to see him so I only came to her house when he wasn't there. After 2/3 weeks she found this too difficult and thought I should talk to him. I said to him that i didn't want this. A few days later, I received a message from him saying that I was ruining the bond between me and my best friend by staying so mad at him. I didn't really respond to this as I didn't think I was wrong. 

However, it kept going through my head. Then she became pregnant with her 2nd child. The contact only came from my side, so when I stopped texting there was actually no contact. After a while I received a message asking what was going on. I indicated that I felt like a filler to her life and not as a friend. That I didn't know how to ensure that our friendship wouldn't break even further. she responded by saying that that was not the case and felt very hurt. so it felt like it was my fault again. After this we had no contact for a while

Now it's 6 months later...

2 months ago I met her and her husband in the store. her husband came to me with their first little one because I was like an aunt to him. I sent him a message when I got home to thank him for coming over with my nephew. After we had texted for a while, he asked if he could come over so we could talk. I agreed to this and it was actually okay. My best friend then got angry because I had contact with him again but not with her. I then gave her a chance by once again opening up to our friendship. We played games together which was quite fun. She asked what I needed to continue our friendship. I told her that I would like the contact to come from her more often. She agreed with this, she said...



3 weeks later I was told by friends that she had been telling shit behind my back. Because of this I was really done with it. She texted me last week asking if I wanted to come over for coffee. I responded that I didn't want this because I had different expectations in our friendship and I don't like her saying things behind my back. she responded very curtly to this and we did not discuss it further

For owners of the Musso Pola 5030, what do you think?

As of 11 p.m. EDT on 10/10/2025 this seller shows 2 machines left in stock

The seller is jinruizhuangshi and it ships from jinruizhuangshi ?

I ordered the same machine from the same seller 20 days ago. From the order tracking, my order shipped from China and the order just cleared customs in the US. The shipping time is 3 to 4 weeks. It‚Äôs most likely that the Musso Pola 5030 was originally shipped from Italy to China and now is being shipped to the US. It probably does not have a US warranty. 

I have spoken with Amazon customer service twice, and they say that it will still have a 30-day window to return and get my money back. Six weeks ago, I would have paid this much for a used Musso Pola 5030 that would not have had a 30-day return period. Amazon customer service said that there would be no additional cost from tariffs or customs and if the shipper did not deliver, I would get a full refund.

The price on Amazon from MUSSO by Lello Appliances is $1,299.99.

A couple of weeks ago I contacted MUSSO by Lello Appliances aka Electra-Craft, Inc, the other current seller on Amazon, and they said that they were not familiar with jinruizhuangshi. 

MAAS ELEKTRO does US warranty and out of warranty repairs for Musso of Italy. They were not familiar with jinruizhuangshi. MAAS ELEKTRO did say that if Musso in Italy approved the warranty coverage, they could do any repairs that might be needed, I am guessing that warranty or not, for repairs, you would have to pay to ship the Musso Pola 5030 in a very large box to New Jersey.

**Proceed with caution...**

1st in Coffee, another US seller of Musso and Nemox ice cream machines has the Musso Pola 5030 for $1,299.00.  1st in Coffee does offer an extended warranty on the Musso Pola 5030 which Amazon does not.

The Musso Pola 5030 from AliExpress is up to $1,019.50 and the website says that it ships from the US.",1,1760155651.0,icecreamery,0,1.0,False

Long story short: customer service 6am-8pm calls thru the day, sometimes I get like 3 calls a day, sometimes 33. Sometimes (very rarely) 0. Each call takes anywhere between 2-10 minutes.

Building hot sauce brand by going to farmers markets every Tuesday, Friday and Saturday. Sometimes Sundays. Soon to be Wednesday too. All 9am-1pm. I cook my sauce at night at the commercial kitchen. And that works out perfectly as nobody calls and etc.

Love my day job as it gives me that ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù to do whatever. Even if at the farmers market - just step aside and answer a phone call. Or if there‚Äôs no market that day I can run my errands, or go to the beach, or coffee shop or just stay at home (usually what I do)

However. Financial situation could be better. As the brand is only 5 month old. Cant really talk about actual income here because I buy things on business credit card, and everything I make from sales I put back to that card. 

So, what are some side gigs ideas would work in this situation?

Tried uber deliveries - works best in the evening/night only. But still not as much money to put away.

When i was 19 he banged his head on the wall and ran to his shed told me he was offing himself. i was dialing in 9 1 1 just so happen my mom pulled in the driveway. I remember on 4th july he woke and up freaked out for no reason and woke me and my sister up in a rage. i was probably 10. Once when i was 5 i asked him to help me with my legos and he grabbed it from me, looked at it, then threw it. When i was 12 he got in road rage with a biker and the biker threatened to shoot him. i was terrified. My dad told me to suck it up or whatrver the fuck he said.

He says that he's pretty busy in the evening He wants to pick it up now. When I'm available NOW, I offer that, but since that wasn't one of the options I gave, obviously that's not an option. I accept that he's busy in the evenings so point out we can do ANYTIME Sunday or Monday. He says he NEEDS it NOW. I don't know what kind of cup holder phone mount emergency he could be having. I let him know that unfortunately I am on my way to work now. I had only stopped to get gas when I got his recent message. He starts in about ""Surely you stop for coffee, I can meet you there, or you can leave it on the porch for me to pick up"". Well no I'm not stopping for coffee, I left just enough time to get ready get gas and go to work. And if I did I don't have it with me, I'm hitting the highway right after I get done getting gas, not going back to get it or to put it on the porch. 

When he said he is pretty busy evenings, I accepted that. When I tell him I'm not available at a certain time, he doesn't accept it and tries to prove me wrong. 

I worked, got off, and since I hadn't scheduled anything, got something to eat and watched videos, felt exhausted so took a nap. He messages me at 8pm wanting to pick it up NOW. So much for being too busy evenings. Since he didn't set up a time that I offered, I didn't wait around and went to sleep. Missed his message. When I woke up, I immediately tried to message him and he'd left the chat. Tried to list a couple more items and got the message about unusual activity on my account and needed to verify my identity. Fixed that, but based on others experiencing need to verify id, I'm guessing he caused that. Really can't imagine a situation that getting a $5 cup holder phone mount was so urgent.

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person. More simply? I want someone to casually chat with daily. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But I don‚Äôt have such lofty expectations of anyone ‚Äì including of myself. Let‚Äôs feel each other out to know what‚Äôs possible and what we‚Äôd like to see happen.

So, who am I exactly? And who are you?

I'm 35, male, and live in the US (ET time zone). Thoroughly introverted, but bold and open with those few who can tap into that aspect of me. I‚Äôm designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, but am an adopter of voice chat, which I sometimes even prefer if I really vibe with someone.

Incremental exchange and the mutual creation of our bond is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it‚Äôs too fluid to be defined. I sort of have a thing for making connections work that otherwise shouldn't.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I‚Äôm an autodidact who‚Äôs been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I‚Äôve been young. I‚Äôm most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee. I‚Äôm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies. I probably have more I take for granted.

(32F)","I (32F) dated a man (36M) for three years. We met in spring 2022 through a dating app. I live in a city in my own one-bedroom apartment, and he lives an hour away at his family‚Äôs farm in the unfinished basement on a futon he‚Äôs had since college.

When we were together, I often felt lonely, anxious, and like I was carrying the relationship. He‚Äôs kind in some ways, but emotionally distant and inconsistent. He doesn‚Äôt like phone calls, only texts every evening like ‚ÄúGood evening! How was your day?‚Äù and then goodnight, and we‚Äôd only see each other every week or two or sometimes three. I always had to initiate deeper conversations, affection, or future plans. He did say during our relationship, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the future,‚Äù or, ‚Äúcan‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next,‚Äù but nothing more it felt, maybe he thought I didn‚Äôt want a future or maybe I accidentally shut him down? I wanted a future in my mind, I pictured raising a family on a farm my whole life, but he didn‚Äôt make me feel very secure, I was never totally sure of his feelings for me, he had a lot of debt and past bad decisions made, his family has a lot of issues which wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if he weren‚Äôt very enmeshed with them, etc.

He also hid a lot of things from me:
	‚Ä¢	He let me think he had a bachelor‚Äôs degree in engineering but actually dropped out, told me on second date.
	‚Ä¢	He didn‚Äôt tell me about his mom‚Äôs severe mental illness DID until 8 months in, after I shared about my mentally ill schizoaffective mom.
	‚Ä¢	He left out that he had a DUI and several past arrests in his early 20s, his friend brought it up in front of me over a year into dating.
	‚Ä¢	He didn‚Äôt tell me he had $125K in private student loans (now around $50K) until 2.5 years in right before moving in.

When I finally broke up with him last winter, it was over text in February. I felt unsafe, unfulfilled, and mentally exhausted. I had just started a new job and had been going through a lot with doubting the relationship and our future for months, being in a very horrible toxic job and looking for a new job for months, finally being hired. I even blocked him for a while because I couldn‚Äôt handle anything anymore and needed to focus on my new job. He later sent flowers to my new job and wanted to talk for closure, but I wasn‚Äôt ready then.

In April, I reached back out, thinking maybe we could rebuild. We met for coffee, and he told me it was ‚Äúvery disrespectful‚Äù how I ended things and that ‚Äútrust had been shattered.‚Äù I know it was disrespectful but it felt like my only options at the time since he lived an hour away, had a temper and was unpredictable, I honestly felt like I still maybe didn‚Äôt know all the sides to him since I felt I didn‚Äôt see him often enough and it would always be at my apartment, and when around his friends different reckless sides would come out. He once threatened me after a harmless comment I made that, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to make him mad,‚Äù and then he started shaking and hitting stuff. Still, we started seeing each other again in April, first casually (coffee, dinners, movies), then more frequently and then he started staying the night again after I suggested it. We text most days and he‚Äôs stayed the night several times.

But five months later, nothing feels very different and I still don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. The last talk we had about it was in June when I brought it up, he claimed he didn‚Äôt know what I wanted and said he had already grieved and moved forward previously and was in a weird position, he said we can work on things and see where it goes.

He still only sees me about every 1-3 weekends. I last saw him 2 weeks ago and before that it was 6 weeks ago. This weekend he is flying out to visit his sister for there annual family remembrance 5k that I went to the last two years. So I won‚Äôt see him for 3 weeks at least if I see him next weekend. He still avoids phone calls and keeps conversation surface-level. He used to call when in a relationship after I asked him to call me once a week if I didn‚Äôt see him, but in my mind it seemed like he didn‚Äôt want to talk to me and wanted to get off the phone, he would say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty boring‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out of material, nothing much to say.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù rarely compliments me, and hasn‚Äôt asked me to be his girlfriend again. When I told him I missed affection and wanted to hold his hand, he started holding my hand again but then pulled away afterward. But now lately he does hold my hand when he comes over and he stays the night and we cuddle the next day.

Meanwhile, some serious red flags remain:
	‚Ä¢	Reckless driving: He‚Äôs totaled his car five times and once terrified me by passing three cars in a no-passing zone and lingering in the oncoming lane in my vehicle at night.
	‚Ä¢	Temper issues: He‚Äôs gone from calm to angry suddenly, once slammed farm equipment and told me, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt wanna make me mad.‚Äù His aunt said he was a terribly sore loser as a kid. 
	‚Ä¢	Financial instability: Still living at home at 36, avoids money conversations, and when we discussed moving in together and I asked how much rent he could do he said he didn‚Äôt know, ‚Äúa few hundred, idk I‚Äôll have to check,‚Äù and then never got back to me. I brought it up again and he still didn‚Äôt know, then finally got me an answer. His family farm that he‚Äôs supposed to inherit also makes no profit and they‚Äôre not doing their books properly which makes me nervous for their future. He was supposed to take over after his dad but he found out his dad cannot retire due to having no retirement savings, so idk what‚Äôs going on. He‚Äôs just a 36 year old man living in his dads basement and I guess using his student loans and the farm as an excuse to not do anything else with his life, he seems content with his friends and family and video games and stuff like that I guess.
	‚Ä¢	Partying lifestyle: Heavy drinking (not sure if he drinks much anymore, but definitely used to, he called himself an alcoholic), weed (not sure how much now but he used to daily and he is dad grows it), and a friend group that often gets drunk and violent and in trouble with the law. He was smoking weed occasionally while working a union job that drug tests for it. When he found out I was worried about that he said he would have stopped if I‚Äôd told him to.

There are positives, he‚Äôs kept his union trades job for two years, paid down his debt, and bought a better car this summer, but emotionally I feel completely stuck. I haven‚Äôt seen his family or friends since last Christmas. He says he wants to take things slow to rebuild trust, but I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs actually wanting it or not. He does text me most nights.

I feel drained, confused, and unwanted. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being impatient or if I‚Äôm just holding onto something that‚Äôs already over. I don‚Äôt know why he continues to text me almost every night. 

TL;DR:
I broke up with my boyfriend last winter because I felt unsafe and unhappy. Reached back out months later, and we‚Äôve been seeing each other casually for about 5 months, but nothing‚Äôs really changed. He‚Äôs distant, noncommittal, and still surrounded by red flags. Should I end it for good, and if so, how can I do it in a way that‚Äôs respectful but firm, without repeating the messy breakup from last time?",2,1760154412.0,whatdoIdo,2,1.0,False

I go to a fairly small high school in a small town, around 600 students. The guy (16m), who I will call DJ, has been bothering me pretty bad for the last year or two. For reference, I am fairly twinky (5'9, 120lbs) and very obviously gay, while DJ is on the football team. It all started last year when he walked up to my table at lunch, and asked me if he could set me up with a guy. I am usually not approached by guys during lunch, especially ones that I've never talked to before, so I was kind of in a state of fight or flight. I just awkwardly said sure and he walked away. He then never followed up on that, so I just assumed one of his friends dared him to do it. That was toward the end of that schoolyear, so I didn't see him until the start of my senior year, which is when it started to get really bad. All of my experiences with him haven't been ""bad"" but it just seems like that weird fake nice that people do when they make fun of you. He would compliment my outfit in a really snarky tone, mimic my reactions to my friends while walking through the hallway, etc. It got to a point that whenever I would be packing to leave this one class, he would always walk in and say something really weird towards me, and my teacher would have to tell him to leave. Fast forward a week or two, and I was walking into our local coffee shop with my friend after school. I went to open the door, and DJ was on the other side, and said, ""No, let me open the door for you, Op,"" As he was very strongly pulling the door closed. I decided it wasn't worth it to fight with him over a door, so I just let him open it, and as he walked out he said, ""Here's the door beautiful."" to which I just responded to with an awkward, ""Thanks..."" My friend was totally weirded out by it, and we both decided he's either really into the bit, or really into me. I don't have any feelings for this guy at all, so it's just getting weird. I've realized he just likes the attention of it, so whenever he tries anything, I just totally ignore him and pretend he isn't there. A few days ago, I was putting some ranch on my salad before I sat down to eat lunch with my friends. He came up behind me and went, ""Op, I need some ranch too, pass me the ranch."" I totally ignored him and just put the ranch back down after I was done with it, so he could reach for it himself. Then, seemingly not getting what he wanted out of me said, ""Op, I'm in love with you."" To which I grabbed my fork and walked away. What I'm wondering is at what point do I need to do more than ignore him, and if I am the a-hole if he actually is in the closet? I know it can be hard for people to come out especially if they're in a small town, but I feel like if he really was, he wouldn't be putting it out there so much. Pls help!

How can I improve on this?

Two possible causes I can think of:
- When I make the topping, the butter and sugar mixture always separates when I add the eggs and I can't fully combine them, but once I add in the flour the mixture comes together again.
- In my recent attempts, I add about 1-1.5 tablespoons of water to the mixture, since without that my mixture is thicker than the recipe's and the topping ends up not melting smoothly in the oven.

I'd appreciate any feedback or theories!",8,1760153809.0,AskBaking,1,1.0,False

Please feel free to ignore this if you are not looking for advice. I completely understand.

I am 28M, married now, and my wife and I have a baby on the way. I say that not to brag, but because I used to feel exactly like a lot of people here. I was convinced no one would ever love me and that I would be alone forever. It was a horrible feeling.

I met my wife completely by chance. I was 22 and decided to start reading more as a hobby. One day I went to the library, totally clueless about where to start. I noticed a girl who looked like she knew her way around, so I asked her for book recommendations. She showed me around, we talked a bit, and after a few minutes of small talk I asked if she wanted to grab coffee sometime. The rest is history.

Around that same time, I also started meeting people online. About five years ago I joined a small Twitch stream with around ten viewers for a game I loved. I chatted for a few days, joined some games with them, and eventually got invited to their Discord. We have been friends ever since and still play together regularly. They might not be in-person friends, but they have been a real source of connection.

I just wanted to share my small success story. I know it can feel like there is no way out of loneliness, but it is possible. You do not have to be super outgoing or the kind of person who can walk up to strangers and charm them. You can find connection through shared interests, hobbies, or online communities.

I hope you do not lose hope. You are not alone, even if it feels that way sometimes. There are people out there who will get you, and it only takes one or two connections to start changing things.",0,1760153737.0,ForeverAlone,1,0.33,False
1o3lcv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorsUK/comments/1o3lcv9/reflections_on_a_year_in_us_healthcare/,Reflections on a year in US healthcare,"Longtime former UK resident and doctorsuk participant here.

I CCTd in radiology last year and have been out in the US for fellowship since then. It‚Äôs been long enough now that I thought I wanted to provide some insight to the comrades back home, especially given it seems things have gotten even worse since I left. 
Some of it expected, some very surprising. I‚Äôve split my thoughts into good, bad, the neutral, and the surprising. With an overall view at the end. Anyway here it goes

The good:
1. Capacity is the opposite of the UK. Plenty of scanners, equipment, nurses, operating theatres. Stuff just gets done and gets done quickly. Sometimes the capacity is so much that an mri might sit idle for an entire day because there are no patients to scan on it. 

2. Hospitals do the small things to make you feel valued. Free coffee, food stipends, your face and name plastered all around the departments etc. 

3. Doctors are well respected both in and out of work. You are always called doctor. Nurses don‚Äôt pretend they can‚Äôt do things to make residents do it. 

4. Working in a system where money is a serious driver teaches you a lot about healthcare economics. I‚Äôve learned more about how a healthcare system is funded in 1 year here than I did over a decade in the NHS.

5. The job market is Hot hot hot. Hospitals are actively trying to recruit, none of this ‚Äúthey come to us.‚Äù My program are considering letting me start as staff after my second year of the ABR pathway because of the radiologist shortage. Starting salaries are 4 times NHS and that‚Äôs the low end given its academic.  Many jobs are 7 times with nearly half the year off. 

6. Great procedural training given the lack of capacity issues (see 1). 

7. Americans are a generally more optimistic people. It‚Äôs hard to put an exact explanation to it but Europe as a whole feels like a much more pessimistic and downtrodden place compared to the US, at least in respect to future prospects. 

The bad:

1. No widespread oversight of best practice means lots of people making very questionable medical decisions. Not so bad at a prestigious hospital but the referrals we get from peripheral hospitals are sometimes borderline negligent from a UK standpoint. Clearly mediocre surgeons performing old school surgeries on patients for questionable indications isn‚Äôt at all uncommon.

2. Everything is set up for billing which means a lot of stupid paperwork and rules about how procedures need to be recorded. Also we end up doing things that are totally wastes of our time just because it makes the department money. Fellows pushing the fluoro button while the SLTs do video swallows is a great example. Total waste of time except it adds to radiology coffers.  

3. Because of the lack of capacity issues doctors atrophy their critical thinking skills. You don‚Äôt need to think about whether you need a test when all the tests are available to do all the time and money isn‚Äôt an issue. We regularly get requests for imaging at a rate that is nonsensical with something as simple as a cholecystitis getting US/MR/CT/NM studies in one admission of a couple of days, but the clinicians keep ordering and the hospital doesn‚Äôt say no given the financial incentives. 

Neutral:

1. Doctors are much more intervention heavy. It‚Äôs pretty weird to see them go and debulk old patients with extensive metastatic disease multiple times, or switch chemo regimens 3 times with a repeat biopsy after every ct showing disease progression, but nobody seems to think anything of it. Overall I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs in the best interests of the patients I see but conversely I‚Äôve seen a lot more patients survive late stage cancers for longer here than I ever did in the Uk.

2. American politics. I‚Äôm fine with it, others aren‚Äôt. Take it or leave it. But money and politics are not workplace taboos here so it does come up sometimes. 

The surprising 
1. There is much less defensive medicine here than I‚Äôm used to In the UK. Seems like people are far less afraid of malpractice suits than British doctors are of the GMC. Might be due to the more consent based approach and increasing tort reform across the country. I‚Äôve heard some other states could be worse. 

Overall: 
Definitely an experience I would recommend although it‚Äôs probably as different to the NHS as you could get, which may be hard to adjust to.
To put it bluntly ive been convinced that UK doctors are probably some of the best trained in the world, in many ways above their American counterparts, so I‚Äôd encourage anyone britjsh trained to seek out opportunities elsewhere in the world given how well you‚Äôve all been trained and how shitty you are currently being treated. 
One of the things I miss about the UK is the intelligent pragmatism of all the doctors I worked with there, which I think was second to none in retrospect. But that being said I have zero nostalgia for the British system as currently constituted.

For myself personally I probably won‚Äôt return. Job prospects here are just too good, and the system acceptable enough that I can live with it for the salary. Will probably eventually go fully remote but I can‚Äôt ever see myself working for the NHS again after working somewhere that even mildly respects me.

**HRT Experiences:**

I've tried, pills, creams, patches in the limited doses available in our currently lacking medical system (estrogen and progesterone), low dose birth control. But even when something seems to help, it only helps for about a month and then I'm back where I started. Or some HRT makes me worse, especially at high doses.

Then after my usual ""flare"" week of panic, I was still on the same HRT dose and expected/hoped to go another nearly 4 weeks, BUT for some baffling reason but only made it 1 week before I started to have horrible anxiety again.

**Anxiety Med Experiences:**

I have CPTSD and have over the years and recently tried SSRIs, propopanol, gabapentin, doxepin,  buspar and the only thing that mildly helps is benzos like clonazapam. But not enough.

**Therapy in General:**

YES over the years and recently I've done every type of therapy from EMDR to talk therapy to MDMA trials to microdose to CBD to parts therapy, nothing helps the horrible hormonal anxiety flares - prior to peri I had anxiety but NEVER like this. Very minor. Wasn't even on anxiety meds.

**Doctors:** Tried OBGYNs, psychiatrists, therapists, reiki, acupunture, naturopaths etc. and none of them have been able to balance my hormones or help anxiety.

# Essentials For Cappuccino

Making a great cappuccino starts with the right essentials. Each part affects the taste and texture. The espresso machine, coffee beans, and milk all play key roles. Knowing what to choose helps you craft a perfect cup every time.

Below are the main essentials to focus on before you begin making your cappuccino.

# Choosing The Right Espresso Machine

Select an espresso machine that fits your needs and budget. Machines with a steam wand allow you to froth milk easily. Look for models with good pressure, usually 9 bars, for rich espresso. Compact machines are great for small kitchens. Machines with built-in grinders save time and space.

# Selecting Coffee Beans

Choose fresh, high-quality coffee beans for the best flavor. Medium roast beans balance acidity and bitterness well. Whole beans keep flavor longer than pre-ground coffee. Grind beans just before brewing for maximum freshness. Arabica beans offer smooth taste; Robusta adds strength and crema.

# Milk Types And Their Impact

Milk texture changes the cappuccino‚Äôs body and taste. Whole milk creates creamy, rich foam. Low-fat milk produces lighter foam with less creaminess. Plant-based milks like oat or almond vary in frothing ability. Use cold milk for better froth. Fresh milk steams to a smooth, velvety texture.

# Preparing The Espresso

Preparing the espresso is the first step to a great cappuccino. It sets the base for the rich and creamy drink. Focus on grinding, tamping, and pulling the shot carefully. Each step affects the flavor and texture of your coffee. Follow these simple instructions for the best results.

# Grinding Coffee Beans

Use fresh coffee beans for the best taste. Grind them just before brewing. Set your grinder to a fine setting, similar to table salt. Avoid too coarse or too powdery grounds. The right grind ensures proper extraction and rich flavor.

# Tamping For Even Extraction

After grinding, place the coffee into the portafilter. Use a tamper to press the grounds evenly. Apply firm and consistent pressure, about 30 pounds. A level tamp helps water flow evenly through the coffee. This prevents bitter or weak espresso shots.

# Pulling The Perfect Shot

Lock the portafilter into the espresso machine. Start the extraction immediately to avoid burning the coffee. Aim for a 25-30 second shot time. The espresso should flow like warm honey. Stop the shot once it turns pale and thin for best taste.

# Steaming And Frothing Milk

Steaming and frothing milk is a key step in making a delicious cappuccino. It gives the drink its creamy texture and rich flavor. The right milk texture balances well with the strong espresso. This section explains how to steam and froth milk perfectly using your espresso machine.

# Choosing The Right Milk Temperature

Start by choosing the correct milk temperature. Aim for 140¬∞F to 150¬∞F (60¬∞C to 65¬∞C). Milk heated above this can taste burnt. Cold milk froths better, so use fresh, chilled milk. Avoid overheating to keep milk‚Äôs natural sweetness.

# Creating Silky Microfoam

Microfoam is smooth and glossy, not bubbly or dry. To create it, position the steam wand just below the milk surface. Introduce air slowly by lowering the pitcher slightly. Move the wand deeper to heat milk evenly. The result is creamy, velvety foam that blends well with espresso.

# Using The Steam Wand Correctly

Clean the steam wand before starting. Submerge it just below the milk‚Äôs surface. Turn on the steam and listen for a gentle hissing sound. Avoid large bubbles; keep a steady position. Tilt the pitcher slightly to create a whirlpool effect. This mixes air and milk for perfect texture. Turn off steam before removing the wand to avoid splashing.

# Combining Espresso And Milk

Combining espresso and milk is the heart of making a great cappuccino. This step blends the rich, bold espresso with creamy, textured milk. The goal is a smooth, balanced drink with perfect flavor and feel. Proper technique makes the difference between a simple coffee and a caf√©-quality cappuccino.

# Pouring Techniques For Texture

Start by holding the cup at an angle. Pour the steamed milk slowly into the espresso. Use a steady, controlled pour to mix milk and coffee evenly. Keep the milk pitcher close to the cup. This helps create a velvety texture. Avoid pouring too fast or too high to keep the foam thick.

# Achieving The Classic Cappuccino Layer

A good cappuccino has three layers: espresso, steamed milk, and foam. Pour the milk until the cup is nearly full. Then add the foam on top with a gentle scoop. The foam should be thick and creamy, about one-third of the drink. This layer adds a light, airy feel with every sip.

# Tips For Latte Art

Latte art starts with smooth, well-textured milk. Begin pouring in the center of the cup. Move the pitcher gently side to side to create designs. Finish by lifting the pitcher to draw shapes like hearts or leaves. Practice helps improve control and creativity. Simple patterns make the cappuccino look inviting and special.

# Common Mistakes To Avoid

Making a cappuccino with an espresso machine is simple. Yet, some mistakes can spoil your coffee experience. Avoid these common errors to enjoy a smooth, creamy cappuccino. Below are the most frequent mistakes to watch out for.

# Overheating Milk

Milk should be steamed to about 150¬∞F (65¬∞C). Overheating milk burns it and changes the taste. It also kills the natural sweetness. Use a thermometer or feel the pitcher‚Äôs side. Stop steaming as soon as it feels hot but not too hot.

# Under Or Over Extracted Espresso

Extracting espresso too quickly or too slowly affects flavor. Under-extraction tastes sour and weak. Over-extraction tastes bitter and harsh. Aim for a 25-30 second extraction time. Use the right grind size and tamp pressure for balanced espresso.

# Improper Frothing Methods

Frothing milk wrongly leads to large bubbles and poor texture. Position the steam wand just below the surface. Move the pitcher gently to create smooth microfoam. Avoid mixing air and milk too much. Good froth is creamy and silky, not bubbly.

# Cleaning And Maintenance

Keeping your espresso machine clean is key to making great cappuccinos every time. Regular cleaning stops milk residue and coffee oils from building up. This helps your machine work well and keeps your coffee tasting fresh. Proper maintenance also prevents breakdowns and costly repairs. Spend a little time each day and week caring for your machine. Your cappuccinos will taste better, and your machine will last longer.

# Cleaning The Steam Wand

After each use, wipe the steam wand with a damp cloth. This removes milk residue before it hardens. Purge the wand by turning on steam for a few seconds. This clears milk inside the wand. Once a week, soak the steam wand in warm water with a little detergent. Use a small brush to clean inside the nozzle. This keeps the steam flow strong and milk fresh.

# Regular Machine Maintenance

Empty the drip tray and coffee grounds container daily. Clean the portafilter and group head with a brush every few days. Run a cleaning cycle with a machine-specific cleaner once a month. Descale your machine regularly to remove mineral buildup. Follow the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions for descaling. This protects the heating element and keeps water flow steady.

# Extending Machine Life

Use filtered water to reduce scale buildup. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive tools on your machine. Keep the machine in a dry, cool place when not in use. Check seals and gaskets for wear and replace them if needed. Regularly inspect all parts and clean them carefully. Proper care helps your espresso machine last for years.

# Customizing Your Cappuccino

Customizing your cappuccino lets you enjoy a unique coffee experience at home. Small changes can make a big difference in taste and texture. Experimenting with flavors, milk choices, and ratios helps you find your perfect cup. This section guides you through simple ways to personalize your cappuccino easily.

# Adding Flavors And Sweeteners

Enhance your cappuccino with syrups like vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut. Use small amounts to avoid overpowering the coffee. Natural sweeteners such as honey or maple syrup add gentle sweetness. Sprinkle cinnamon or cocoa powder on top for extra aroma and taste. These additions create a richer and more enjoyable drink.

# Adjusting Milk To Coffee Ratio

The classic cappuccino uses equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam. You can increase milk for a creamier, milder cup. Use less milk if you prefer a stronger coffee flavor. Adjust foam thickness based on your texture preference. Finding the right balance creates a cappuccino that suits your taste.

# Alternative Milk Options

Try almond, oat, soy, or coconut milk to change flavor and texture. Each milk type froths differently, affecting the foam quality. Almond milk offers a nutty note, while oat milk is creamy and smooth. Soy milk provides a rich texture close to dairy. Choose the milk that fits your diet and flavor preference.

Today we visited grandma (my mom) and he loves to play everywhere and she lets him. He stopped at a coffee table and grabbed a wing shaped metal ash tray (clean and only decor) and started to hit the table with it, he likes the sound. My mom comes in and says ""Grandma doesn't like when you hit the table, remember? Please don't hit the table"". He looked at her, smiled and stopped immediately; he then sat down turned to look at her with a grin and started to hit the floor! I swear he was saying ""I listened, you never said don't hit the floor"" with his eyes.

I was watching from the living room, and was impressed, he listened and found the loop hole. My mom was trying so hard not to laugh because he was obedient but smart. I was very proud but also concerned about my future and how I will need to be careful with my words when giving him instructions or orders. 

Maybe other parents have experienced this or might be common for toddlers but he's is my first and I was impressed ",60,1760152955.0,MaliciousCompliance,7,0.85,False

That being said, my husband has repeatedly accused me of having character flaws I‚Äôve practically never been accused of by anyone else.  He has repeatedly told me that I‚Äôm selfish, ungrateful, and he complained that nothing he does is good enough.

I ended up getting manipulated into carrying the main load for our living for months and then ended up paying for an entire Christmas road trip.  If a couple lived an openly feminist marriage and she wanted to treat her husband to a vacation out of her paycheck of her own volition that‚Äôs cool.  But my husband orders things when he isn‚Äôt carrying the responsibility.  For him to talk constantly about the Bible and wifely obedience and then make me pay for a Christmas trip out of my earnings is such a flaming abomination.

The relevance of the Christmas trip is he failed to be a provider to the point he didn‚Äôt even pull his own weight, and then he was so ungrateful he was verbally abusive to me for even wanting to have any input on it.  If we‚Äôre going to talk about gratitude he should have been grateful he got to enjoy a trip he couldn‚Äôt afford.

Recently he caught me trying to hide things I paid for and said, ‚ÄúTypical selfish [OP].‚Äù  I have this nice backpack I use as my work bag.  I had these little packets of instant coffee in case I‚Äôm in a pinch at work and need some coffee to function and feel better.  Obviously those are proportionally more expensive than just making regular coffee from a large container.  He lectured me because he had seen me hide my work bag and he went and found the bag and took from it anyway.  He didn‚Äôt want to live without coffee that morning and we were out because he had failed to buy more, so he reached into my work bag and took from my stash.

I got sick of having to pay for 100% of things for the household like soap for our bodies, dishes, and laundry; house cleaners, toiletries, etc.  I finally asked him to pitch in a little for it which caused a fight and then he begrudgingly gave me some money for it.  He had finally started buying some of our groceries but much of it wasn‚Äôt good fresh food, just junk like cheap frozen pizzas and cereal.",4,1760152871.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

When i was 4 he freaked out when babysitting me and my sister and he put us in car, drove like a maniac then rolled window down and screened at construction workers then got home and threw coffee and couch. Once he was in a rage and punched holes in the wall in front of me and my sister. I think i was 10. I remember he threw a pizza at my mom once, and once on easter he threw coffee inside and it was everywhere. I remember when i was 10 he told me he was leaving and i was ‚Äú90% of this shit‚Äù. He once said he wishes i wasnt born, think i was 11. When i was 19 he banged his head on the wall and ran to his shed told me he was offing himself. i was dialing in 9 1 1 just so happen my mom pulled in the driveway. I remember on 4th july he woke and up freaked out for no reason and woke me and my sister up in a rage. i was probably 10. Once when i was 5 i asked him to help me with my legos and he grabbed it from me, looked at it, then threw it. When i was 12 he got in road rage with a biker and the biker threatened to shoot him. i was terrified. My dad told me to suck it up or whatrver the fuck he said. And this is just the stuff that comes to the top of my head. Hes ruined vacations, holidays, etc. im 23 and my parents are still happily marrried.

I'm working on a JetAuto robot (Jetson Nano + OAK-D Lite camera) in a Docker + ROS2 Humble setup, and I'm running into some frustrating odometry problems when trying to do person following.

Here's what I'm trying to achieve:

* Detect person with OAK-D camera
* Measure distance and maintain a specific follow distance
* Record the path with waypoints while following
* Stop following, save the recording, and do the inverted path back to start

I've got this setup with 4 lifecycle nodes:

1. Person tracker (OAK-D detection)
2. Person follower (sends cmd\_vel based on tracking)
3. Path recorder (saves odometry to waypoints)
4. Path follower (does the return journey using inverted path)

The weird part: when I record paths using a joystick, everything works perfectly - the recorded paths are clean and the return navigation is spot on. But when I use the person follower, the odometry goes completely crazy and creates these wild, unpredictable paths.

I'm using the differential drive controller for odometry, with a Python driver that talks to a C++ ROS2 control interface via topics. I suspect the issue might be that I don't have proper velocity control - the cmd\_vel commands I'm sending aren't matching what's actually happening with the physical motors.

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of ""good with joystick, terrible with autonomous control"" odometry situation? I feel like I'm missing something fundamental about making sure the velocity commands actually translate to real robot motion.

The person following itself works okay - the robot does follow and maintain distance, but the recorded path looks like a toddler drove it after drinking too much coffee. Meanwhile, my manual joystick paths are smooth and predictable.

I'm wondering if I need to implement proper velocity control for the motors rather than just hoping the cmd\_vel translates directly. Or maybe there's something about the timing/frequency of commands from the person follower that's messing with the odometry?

If there are any communities or groups that regularly discuss this kind of ROS2 + robotics vision + control stuff, I'd love to join. Feeling a bit stuck and would appreciate any pointers from people who've been down this road before!

My teenage daughter and her friends were at coffee shop today studying/doing homework together. A grown man sat diagonally to them with his pants low enough to reveal quite a bit of buttcrack.

They took pictures of him, and they were absolutely absurd. It looked like he was trying extremely hard to reveal himself. He even had to sit in an awkward position for his butt to even be in their line of sight. 

To make matters worse, this man, according to my daughter, was ostensibly studying with high school math YouTube videos. They took a picture of his laptop and zoomed in to see if he was doing anything productive - and he clearly put a random video on to hide his intentions.

1o3kjs4,https://youtu.be/QOw7HFSZcoI,4 Very Scary TRUE Isolated Vineyard Worker Horror Stories,"# ""The Back Field"":

I started that morning like any other, driving out toward the rows of grapevines in Arvin, where the land stretches in long, quiet lines under a pale sky. My job as a pruner kept me mostly alone, clipping back the overgrowth to ready the vines for next season. The work was repetitive, steady‚Äîthe kind that quiets the mind if you let it. Mr. Ramirez, my boss, had assigned me the back section, far from the road, where the hum of engines faded into wind and birds. He trusted me there because I knew the land better than most and didn‚Äôt mind the solitude.  
I thought I liked being alone. That day taught me otherwise.

The dirt path to the back field was rough, scattered with stones that rattled beneath my old truck‚Äôs tires. The morning light came in gold, still cool enough to breathe easy. I was halfway down the track when I noticed something strange‚Äîfresh tire tracks veering off into the vines. Not from our tractors; too narrow. Looked like a car had been out here, maybe late in the night. I paused, frowning at it, then shook my head. Kids, I figured. Maybe someone looking for a place to drink.

I parked and got to work. The air smelled of dry soil and sap. The rhythm of snipping branches soon took over‚Äîsnip, step, toss, repeat. The only sounds were the crunch of my boots, the faint hum of bees, and a crow calling somewhere far off.

Around mid-morning, I heard it: a soft rustle deeper between the rows. I stopped mid-cut, holding my breath. Could‚Äôve been a rabbit. Maybe a coyote nosing through. But something about it‚Äîtoo slow, too deliberate. Like someone trying to move quietly. I turned my head and called out, ‚ÄúHello? Anyone there?‚Äù  
Nothing. Just the vines whispering in the wind.

I shrugged it off and went back to work, though I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling I wasn‚Äôt alone. Mr. Ramirez always warned us to watch for strangers‚Äîpeople cut through these fields sometimes, or worse, hid in them.

By noon, I was sweating through my shirt. I sat beneath a thick patch of vines for shade and pulled out my sandwich. My phone buzzed‚ÄîElena calling.  
‚ÄúCarlos, you okay out there?‚Äù Her voice was soft, warm, the kind that always made the world feel smaller, safer.  
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, forcing a chuckle. ‚ÄúJust quiet. Usual stuff.‚Äù  
‚ÄúYou sound tense,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMake sure you drink water. And come home early, okay? I made your favorite stew.‚Äù  
I smiled at that. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there soon. Love you.‚Äù  
‚ÄúLove you too. Be safe.‚Äù

I hung up, chewing slowly, feeling her words fade into the stillness around me. Then the sound came again‚Äîcloser this time. A rustle, a pause. I rose, scanning the green corridors of vines. Nothing. Just the still heat.  
I moved to another row, deeper in. The vines were older there, thicker, curling around the wires like veins. That‚Äôs when I spotted something half-buried in the dirt‚Äîa glove. Not mine. Leather, worn, one side dark with stains. I picked it up, turning it in my hand. It smelled faintly metallic, sharp and sour. My stomach tightened, but I pocketed it anyway. Maybe one of the other workers had dropped it.

The afternoon stretched on, hours blurring together. Then came the sound that froze me where I stood‚Äîa low, broken moan from somewhere ahead.  
Not an animal. Human.

I gripped my shears like a weapon. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called out. ‚ÄúYou hurt?‚Äù  
No answer. Just the vines swaying slightly in the breeze.  
Against my better judgment, I followed the sound. Every few steps, I glanced over my shoulder, half expecting someone‚Äîor something‚Äîto move behind me.

The rows opened into a small clearing where a maintenance road cut through. That‚Äôs when I saw it. At first, I thought it was a mannequin, maybe some sick prank. But as I stepped closer, the details came into focus‚Äîpale skin, limbs twisted, a body arranged with unsettling care. A woman. Naked. Headless.  
Her neck was a clean cut‚Äîsurgical. No blood around. Both thumbs missing, hands folded neatly on her stomach.  
A noise escaped me, half gasp, half curse. My shears fell from my hand.

I fumbled for my phone. ‚Äú911,‚Äù I whispered as it rang. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a body‚Äîin the vineyard off Sebastian Road. She‚Äôs‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs been murdered. Please, hurry.‚Äù

The operator‚Äôs voice was calm, mechanical. ‚ÄúSir, stay on the line. Are you safe? Is anyone else there?‚Äù  
‚ÄúI‚Äî‚Äù I looked around. The vines shuddered somewhere behind me. Branches snapping. Someone moving. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I whispered.

The sound of retreating footsteps echoed between the rows. Whoever it was hadn‚Äôt gone far. I backed away from the body, scanning the green tunnels, every rustle now a threat.

It felt like an eternity before I heard sirens in the distance. I called Mr. Ramirez next, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúBoss, you gotta come. There‚Äôs a dead woman here‚Äîshe‚Äôs‚Ä¶ mutilated.‚Äù  
‚ÄúCarlos, slow down. Are you sure? Stay where you are. I‚Äôll call the police.‚Äù

I barely heard him. Something shifted in my peripheral vision‚Äîa figure darting between the vines. Tall. Dressed in dark clothes. Watching me. Then gone.  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still here!‚Äù I yelled into the phone. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still‚Äî‚Äù

I dropped the call and ran, heart pounding, lungs on fire. The vines whipped at my arms as I tore through them. Behind me came faint snaps, like someone giving chase. I didn‚Äôt look back. I just ran until I saw my truck and slammed the door, locking it fast.

As I sped down the dirt path, dust swirling in the mirror, I caught sight of another vehicle‚Äîhalf-hidden behind a wall of vines. A dark sedan. It pulled away slowly, almost casually, disappearing toward the hills.

The police came soon after. The place swarmed with flashing lights, yellow tape, detectives combing the rows. One of them, a tall woman with tired eyes, asked, ‚ÄúDid you see anyone? Hear anything unusual?‚Äù  
I told her about the glove. The footsteps. The figure. ‚ÄúHe was still there,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe watched me.‚Äù  
She nodded grimly. ‚ÄúThe head and thumbs‚Äîmeans he didn‚Äôt want her identified. This wasn‚Äôt random.‚Äù

That night, at home, I sat at the dinner table, staring at my untouched bowl of stew.  
‚ÄúWhat if he saw me?‚Äù I whispered to Elena. ‚ÄúWhat if he knows who I am?‚Äù  
She squeezed my hand. ‚ÄúYou did the right thing. The police will handle it.‚Äù

But a few days later, the glove I‚Äôd kept in my truck‚Äîgone. Vanished without a trace.  
Then came the phone calls. No words, just breathing. Slow, deliberate.

I changed my number. I moved to Bakersfield. Quit the vineyards for good.

Years passed. They eventually identified her‚ÄîAda Beth Kaplan, sixty-four, from Canyon Country. Cancer survivor. Lived alone. No one had even reported her missing. But her killer? Never caught.

Sometimes, when I drive past those endless green fields, I still catch myself scanning the vines for movement.  
And in those moments, I swear I feel it again‚Äîthat quiet, deliberate rustle.  
As if someone‚Äôs still out there, watching, waiting for another soul who works alone in the rows.





# ""The Ash Pit"":

I‚Äôd been working those vines up on the ridge for months‚Äîpruning, tying, and shaping them as the cold hung heavy over the Mendocino hills. The land belonged to a small outfit with no name worth remembering, just a few dozen acres of grapes clinging to the slopes above the Navarro River. The rows stretched endlessly, their bare tendrils rattling in the wind like dry bones. My cabin sat at the edge of the property, a rough little place built from pine, with a stove that smoked too much and a bed that creaked with every breath of wind.

Most days passed in silence. I liked it that way. I‚Äôd wake before dawn, boil coffee, and work until my fingers numbed, the fog rolling off the valley like ghostly waves. Occasionally the owner would ride up to check progress, or a neighbor would stop by to trade eggs for wine, but mostly it was just me, the hills, and the cold air.

Then came that afternoon in early January of 1911‚Äîa date I‚Äôll never forget.

The sky had that pale, washed-out look it gets before dusk, and the wind was still. I was halfway through pruning when I noticed a thin ribbon of smoke twisting up from the far end of the ridge, just beyond the upper rows. Too thin for a brush pile, too low for a chimney. My first thought was a vagrant‚Äôs campfire. But something about it looked wrong‚Äîtoo controlled, like someone didn‚Äôt want it noticed.

I set down my shears and followed the path uphill, the dirt soft under my boots. As I climbed, a strange odor met me‚Äîsomething acrid and foul, like burned hair and meat. I pressed my sleeve to my nose and kept going, heart beginning to pound.

When I reached the clearing, I stopped dead.

There, in a shallow pit, was a smoldering heap of ash and wood, smoke curling in lazy, gray tendrils. The air shimmered with heat, and flies already gathered in a black halo over it. I nudged at the pile with a stick, half afraid of what I‚Äôd find.

That‚Äôs when I saw the bones.

Long ones, brittle and cracked. And then something round, half-buried‚Äîa skull, blackened but unmistakable, the sockets hollow and staring.

I stumbled back, bile rising in my throat. The silence around me pressed close, broken only by the faint hiss of cooling embers. I don‚Äôt remember running down the hill, but I must have, because the next thing I knew, I was throwing a saddle over my horse and riding hard into Boonville.

I burst into Sheriff Donohoe‚Äôs office still covered in sweat and ash.  
‚ÄúSheriff,‚Äù I gasped, ‚Äúyou need to come quick. There‚Äôs bones up on the ridge‚Äîhuman bones, I swear it.‚Äù

He looked up from his desk, unimpressed at first. ‚ÄúSlow down there. You sure they ain‚Äôt from a hog or a deer? Folks burn carcasses all the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot this,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSkull‚Äôs too big. Too human. And the smell‚ÄîGod, the smell.‚Äù

That made him move. He grabbed his hat, called his deputy, and together we rode out, the hooves clattering on the frozen road. The sheriff stayed quiet most of the way, asking a question here and there.

‚ÄúAnyone been up that way lately?‚Äù  
‚ÄúJust the neighbor, Pete Gianoli. Lives in the old cabin by the creek. Keeps to himself mostly.‚Äù

We reached the clearing before dark. The sheriff crouched near the ashes, turning pieces over with a gloved hand. ‚ÄúJawbone,‚Äù he muttered, holding it up to the light. ‚ÄúSplit ribs‚Ä¶ looks like axe marks.‚Äù

I felt the chill spread through me.

They searched the surrounding brush and found a torn coat, half-buried under oak leaves. Inside the pocket were a few coins and a rusted clasp knife. I recognized it instantly‚Äîit belonged to Joe Cooper, a drifter who‚Äôd been missing a few weeks. Last anyone saw him, he was heading up toward the ridge with a jug of wine, promising to help Gianoli fix his fence.

The sheriff straightened up slowly. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs our man, or what‚Äôs left of him.‚Äù

By nightfall, word had spread through the valley. Folks talked in low voices outside the saloon, speculating about what kind of monster could do such a thing.

That evening, the vineyard owner stopped by my cabin. He stood in the doorway holding a lantern, his face pale.  
‚ÄúHeard what you found,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou holding up?‚Äù

‚ÄúTrying,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut it don‚Äôt feel right. Whoever did this‚Äîhe‚Äôs still out there.‚Äù

He nodded grimly. ‚ÄúLock your door tonight, son. If the killer‚Äôs local, he won‚Äôt take kindly to being found out.‚Äù

I did just that. As the wind rattled the shutters, I sat by the window with my rifle laid across my knees. Every sound set my nerves on edge‚Äîthe creak of timbers, the distant cry of a coyote, the whisper of vines brushing the cabin walls.

The next day, Sheriff Donohoe came back with more men. They rode straight to Gianoli‚Äôs cabin. He met them at the door, calm as could be, but his eyes gave him away‚Äîshifty, dark, calculating.

‚ÄúI burned some rabbits,‚Äù he told them when they found the jug inside. ‚ÄúMaybe some bones got mixed in. Ain‚Äôt no crime in that.‚Äù

The sheriff stared at him a long time. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre coming with us, Pete.‚Äù

As they led him away, he turned and looked straight at me. There was no anger on his face, just a cold, knowing stare that made my stomach turn.

The trial came in March. The courthouse was packed, the air thick with curiosity and fear. I testified about finding the bones, the smell, the skull. The prosecutor painted Gianoli as a violent man, but the defense argued the evidence was circumstantial. Without a full body, the jury couldn‚Äôt be sure.

In the end, Gianoli walked free.

Rumor had it he bragged about the killing afterward‚Äîsaid Cooper tried to cheat him, and things got ‚Äúout of hand.‚Äù But no one could prove it, and no one dared press him further.

I went back to the vines, but the ridge never felt the same. The wind seemed colder there, the earth heavier. Sometimes, working alone, I‚Äôd catch movement out of the corner of my eye‚Äîsomeone watching from between the rows.

One night, I woke to the sound of slow, deliberate footsteps outside. Gravel crunching. Then silence.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù I shouted, clutching my knife. Nothing answered but the wind.

Come morning, I found boot prints in the mud‚Äîleading straight from my door toward Gianoli‚Äôs cabin. I rode to town again, told the sheriff.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs watching me,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI can feel it.‚Äù

The sheriff nodded. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the only one. He‚Äôs been making threats to witnesses. Stay armed.‚Äù

Weeks later, they arrested him again‚Äîsaid he‚Äôd threatened to kill two men down by the store. This time, he didn‚Äôt fight. The court sent him to the state hospital in Napa, where doctors called him insane.

They said he confessed there. Told one of the attendants he‚Äôd chopped Joe Cooper up after an argument and burned what he could.

Even with him locked away, the dread didn‚Äôt leave. The ridge seemed haunted by it. I‚Äôd walk through the rows and imagine the bones buried beneath, feeding the roots.

By summer, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I packed what little I owned, left the cabin, and headed down the coast. But the image still follows me‚Äîthe burned skull, the smell of ash and blood, the feeling of eyes watching from the dark.

Some things, once unearthed, never go quiet again.





# ""The Long Rows"":

I started that morning like any other, walking the long rows of vines in the far corner of the Sonoma County vineyard. The air was cool, the fog just beginning to lift off the hills, leaving the dew glistening on the leaves like glass. I worked alone most days‚Äîjust me, the shears, and the whisper of wind through the branches. Out here, the vines stretched forever, green walls swallowing sound and sight, so that the world beyond a few feet simply ceased to exist.

I had been pruning for months, sunrise to sunset, earning just enough to send home. My name didn‚Äôt matter much here‚Äîjust another pair of hands from Mexico, chasing the steady rhythm of work, trying to hold on to a dream that kept getting smaller.

That morning, Ramon came late. He was one of us, strong, quiet, but lately... different. His eyes were red-rimmed, his face drawn like he hadn‚Äôt slept in days. He muttered to himself as he sharpened his knife, the rasp of metal echoing too loud in the still air. I lifted my head from the vines and nodded. ‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù I called, trying to sound casual.

He just stared‚Äîexpression blank, unreadable‚Äîand then walked off toward the far edge of the property where the supervisor, Ken, usually inspected the irrigation lines. I watched him go until the vines swallowed him whole.

By noon, the sun was relentless. The rows shimmered in the heat, and the hum of insects filled the silence. My hands burned from the shears, but I kept clipping. Work kept me steady. Then, out of nowhere, I heard a sharp *pop*‚Äîlike a firecracker far away. I paused, listening. Another pop, closer this time.

I straightened up, scanning the rows. Nothing but vines shifting in the wind. I told myself it was just machinery, maybe a tractor backfiring. But something in my gut twisted.

A few minutes later, footsteps crunched through the dry soil behind me. It was Jos√©‚Äîhis face pale, his shirt smeared with dirt and sweat.  
‚ÄúYou heard that?‚Äù he asked, voice tight.  
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSounded like‚Ä¶ shots.‚Äù

He nodded, looking over his shoulder. ‚ÄúRamon was arguing with Ken earlier‚Äîabout pay again. Ken told him to calm down or leave. He didn‚Äôt take it well.‚Äù

We stood there, the vines rustling softly around us, the world suddenly too quiet. I could hear my own pulse in my ears.

We decided to check it out. The walk toward the irrigation lines felt endless, the rows seeming narrower with every step. The smell of earth grew heavier, wetter. The air felt wrong‚Äîthick, unmoving. Then we saw him.

Ken lay face down between two rows, blood soaking the soil beneath him. The red spread like spilled wine, dark and glistening under the sun.

Jos√© gasped and stumbled back. ‚ÄúMadre de Dios‚Ä¶‚Äù  
I knelt, my hands trembling as I touched Ken‚Äôs neck. No pulse. His skin was already cold.  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone,‚Äù I whispered.

Jos√©‚Äôs eyes darted around wildly. ‚ÄúWho did this?‚Äù

Before I could answer, we heard more footsteps‚Äîfast, heavy, coming closer. We ducked behind a thick cluster of vines, holding our breath.

Ramon appeared, moving through the rows with purpose. There was a gun in his hand. His face was twisted, his jaw tight, eyes unfocused. He looked like a man already lost.

Jos√© gripped my arm, whispering, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs him.‚Äù

We crouched lower as Ramon stopped just yards away, scanning the vines like a hunter. His breathing was ragged, almost animal. Then, after a long moment, he kicked at the dirt and muttered something in Spanish I couldn‚Äôt catch‚Äîsomething about ‚Äúall of them‚Äù‚Äîbefore stalking off toward the main road.

We waited until the sound of his boots faded, then ran. The vineyard was a maze, every turn the same, the air thick with panic. We reached the small tool shed near the boundary fence‚Äîa wooden structure that smelled of oil, dust, and rust. We slammed the door and braced it with a shovel.

Inside, it was stifling. Dust hung in the sunbeams cutting through the cracks in the wall. Jos√© sat on the floor, shaking. ‚ÄúWhat do we do?‚Äù  
‚ÄúWe wait,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSomeone must‚Äôve heard the shots.‚Äù

But no sirens came. The only sounds were the ticking of the old clock on the shelf and our own breathing.

Then‚Äîa scrape outside.

We froze.

Another scrape, closer. Then the door handle began to turn.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs in there?‚Äù Ramon‚Äôs voice. Calm. Too calm. It carried a strange, dangerous edge.

We didn‚Äôt move.

‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre in there,‚Äù he said, voice rising. ‚ÄúCome out. We need to talk.‚Äù

The handle rattled harder.

‚ÄúOpen the door!‚Äù he shouted, slamming his fist against the wood. The whole shed shook. Jos√© whimpered. I grabbed a rake, holding it tight, my palms slick with sweat.

Then‚Äîsilence.

A heartbeat later, the door exploded inward with a gunshot. Wood splintered. Jos√© screamed. Another shot cracked the air, tearing through the boards.

Light spilled in through the hole‚Äîand then Ramon‚Äôs shadow.

He stepped inside, gun raised, eyes glassy, lips trembling. ‚ÄúYou saw nothing,‚Äù he said.

Jos√© bolted for the side. Ramon fired. The sound tore through the shed like thunder. Jos√© dropped instantly, clutching his side, blood soaking through his shirt.

Something inside me broke. I swung the rake with everything I had, hitting Ramon‚Äôs arm. He cried out, dropping the gun. We both dove for it. He was faster, grabbing my throat and slamming me to the ground. His weight crushed me, his hands iron around my neck.

‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve stayed out of it,‚Äù he hissed. His spit hit my cheek as I clawed at his face. My vision darkened, the edges closing in. I kicked wildly, one heel catching his jaw. He fell back just enough. I lunged, grabbed the gun, and aimed it at him.

‚ÄúStop!‚Äù I gasped.

He laughed‚Äîa hollow, broken sound. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt shoot. You don‚Äôt have it in you.‚Äù He took a step closer, eyes burning.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked, voice trembling. ‚ÄúWhy Ken? Why us?‚Äù

He stopped, shoulders heaving. ‚ÄúBecause everything‚Äôs gone. My wife left. My kids hate me. Ken wanted to fire me. I gave everything, and it was never enough.‚Äù

He looked more lost than angry now, a man eaten alive by despair.

I backed toward the door, keeping the gun steady. Then I turned and ran.

The vineyard swallowed me whole. The rows seemed endless, twisting, alive. Leaves clawed at my face as I sprinted. Behind me, Ramon‚Äôs footsteps pounded closer.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt hide!‚Äù he shouted, voice echoing through the vines.

I dove low, crawling under the tangled branches, my breath loud in my ears. Dirt filled my mouth. I could hear him just a few feet away, boots crunching the soil.

Time lost meaning. The sun slid lower, turning everything gold and sinister.

Then‚Äîsirens.

Faint at first, then louder.

He heard them too. His footsteps broke into a run, away this time.

I waited until I was sure he was gone before I staggered out of the rows. Police cars pulled up near the entrance, lights flashing red and blue across the fields. I stumbled toward them, waving weakly, the gun still trembling in my grip.

They shouted commands, took the weapon, surrounded me‚Äîbut I pointed back toward the vines, gasping his name.

They caught Ramon that evening, miles away. He had killed his family before coming to work. Ken was just another in a long unraveling.

I told them everything. But the fear never left.

Now, years later, I still dream of those vines‚Äîthe way they swayed and whispered as if they were alive. In the dark, I hear his voice calling through them, calm and steady. The vineyard is still there, stretching across those hills like nothing ever happened. But I know better.

Somewhere between the rows, something still lingers.

Madness. Guilt. The echo of footsteps that never really stopped.





# ""The Contractor"":

I came to the Sacramento Valley in early 1971, chasing rumors of steady pay among the fruit fields and vineyards. I‚Äôd been drifting for years, crossing the border and working my way north through California‚Äôs farms, never staying long enough to grow roots. This place, though‚Äîit felt different from the start. The land was wide and endless, vines stretching like green corridors beneath the pale blue sky. You could walk half a mile down a row and feel like the last man alive.

My name is Luis. I took work under a labor contractor named Victor‚Äîa broad-shouldered man with a scar down his cheek and a quiet, heavy stare. He hired men like me: the wanderers, the ones nobody would come looking for if we disappeared.

At first, everything seemed normal. Victor picked us up in his battered truck at dawn and dropped us at the vineyards or peach orchards. We worked until our hands blistered, until the sun sank low and painted the hills in red light. He paid in cash, no questions asked, which suited men who carried more past than future.

But after a few weeks, things started to feel wrong.

The first to vanish was Pablo‚Äîa thin man from Guadalajara who‚Äôd shared my bunk. One morning, his bed was empty. His duffel was gone, but his jacket still hung on the post by the door. Pablo never went anywhere without that jacket.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Pablo?‚Äù I asked Jorge, a stout man with a mustache, while we tied vines in the far rows. The air smelled of crushed leaves and dust.

Jorge didn‚Äôt look at me. ‚ÄúProbably moved on. Maybe found better pay.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeft his jacket,‚Äù I said.

He hesitated, knife poised midair. ‚ÄúVictor said he quit last night. Got in a fight. Don‚Äôt ask questions, Luis. Just keep working.‚Äù

But I couldn‚Äôt shake it. Pablo had talked about sending money home to his sister. He wouldn‚Äôt have left without telling me.

That night, the bunkhouse felt colder. I lay awake on my cot, listening to the wind slide through the vineyard like a whisper. Once, I thought I heard something outside‚Äîthe scrape of a shovel against dirt‚Äîbut when I held my breath to listen, it stopped.

A few days later, another man was gone. Manuel, quiet, kept to himself. He‚Äôd been complaining about back pain. Victor pulled him aside to talk that morning, and by nightfall, Manuel‚Äôs place by the fire was empty.

‚ÄúAnyone seen Manuel?‚Äù I asked as we ate our beans from tin plates.

Raul, an older man with hollow eyes, looked up. ‚ÄúHe went to town for medicine. Victor took him.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Victor‚Äôs truck hasn‚Äôt moved,‚Äù I said.

Raul‚Äôs expression tightened. ‚ÄúThen maybe he walked. Don‚Äôt ask questions, amigo. You‚Äôll just bring trouble.‚Äù

The others stayed silent, heads low. I knew then that everyone felt it too‚Äîthe strange quiet that followed each disappearance, the way Victor‚Äôs eyes lingered too long.

Weeks passed. The crew kept shrinking. First Tomas. Then Eduardo. Then little Francisco. Each time, Victor had an excuse: ‚ÄúHe got drunk and left,‚Äù or ‚ÄúHe owed money, ran off.‚Äù But his words always came too easy, too smooth.

One afternoon, while pruning vines in a far corner of the property, Jorge motioned me over. His hands trembled.

‚ÄúI found something,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúOut by the orchards. Fresh dirt turned over. Like a grave.‚Äù

My stomach clenched. ‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù

He nodded. ‚ÄúVictor‚Äôs truck tracks were there too. I think he‚Äôs killing them.‚Äù

I stared at him. ‚ÄúWhy? What for?‚Äù

Jorge‚Äôs voice dropped. ‚ÄúMoney, maybe. Or something worse. He looks at us like we‚Äôre already dead.‚Äù

That night, Raul joined our whispers by the fire. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard stories,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúMen like him prey on drifters. They take what they want. No one asks.‚Äù

I started sleeping with a knife in my boot. Every creak of the shack set my heart pounding. I counted the hours until daylight.

Then one evening, as I washed at the pump, Victor came up behind me. ‚ÄúYou look tired, Luis,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúBack hurting?‚Äù

‚ÄúA little,‚Äù I lied, my hand still in the cold water.

‚ÄúI can take you to town for medicine,‚Äù he offered. ‚ÄúOr‚Ä¶ maybe you‚Äôd like to earn extra tonight. Double pay.‚Äù

The same lie he told the others.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll pass,‚Äù I said, forcing a smile.

He stared at me for a long moment. ‚ÄúSuit yourself.‚Äù His hand brushed my shoulder before he walked away. It felt like a warning.

That night, I told Jorge and Raul. ‚ÄúHe asked me to go with him. Like Manuel.‚Äù

Jorge‚Äôs face drained of color. ‚ÄúWe leave tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut where?‚Äù Raul said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got no money saved.‚Äù

Before we could answer, footsteps crunched outside. The door creaked open. Victor stood there in the lamplight, his shadow long across the floor.

‚ÄúWhat are you boys whispering about?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù Raul said quickly. ‚ÄúJust the work.‚Äù

Victor smiled‚Äîsmall, tight, wrong. ‚ÄúGood. Get some rest. Big day tomorrow.‚Äù

The door shut. The silence after was unbearable. I didn‚Äôt sleep that night. I watched the moon crawl across the floorboards, one hand on the knife.

By morning, Jorge was gone.

His bunk empty. His tools missing. His boots by the door.

‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù I demanded.

Victor, loading the truck, said flatly, ‚ÄúHe quit. Said he had family trouble.‚Äù

Raul wouldn‚Äôt look at me. I knew.

The truck rattled along the dirt roads, past endless rows of vines. Every mile felt like a countdown. When we stopped for lunch, I walked toward the peach orchards, pretending to stretch my legs.

That‚Äôs when I saw it‚Äîa patch of soil, freshly turned. Something sticking out. A shoe.

My throat tightened. I brushed away dirt. A hand emerged, gray and stiff. Jorge.

I staggered back, heart hammering. My vision blurred. The world tilted.

A truck engine roared behind me. Victor‚Äôs voice: ‚ÄúLuis! What are you doing out here?‚Äù

I turned. He was stepping out of the cab, shovel in hand.

‚ÄúJust‚Äîjust getting air,‚Äù I said.

He tilted his head. ‚ÄúSee anything interesting?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

He smiled faintly. ‚ÄúCome with me. I need help with something.‚Äù

I froze. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúA hole,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNeeds filling.‚Äù

Every instinct screamed *run*, but the fields stretched wide and empty. He‚Äôd catch me before the road.

We walked in silence through the vines. The air felt heavy, the ground soft beneath my boots. My hand brushed the knife in my boot, fingers slick with sweat.

He stopped near the grave. ‚ÄúYou saw it, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù His voice was calm.

‚ÄúSaw what?‚Äù I said, though my throat barely worked.

‚ÄúThe body,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have gone poking around.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhy kill them?‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúThey argue. They steal. Nobody misses you men.‚Äù

He lifted the shovel. Sunlight flashed on the metal.

I lunged, drawing the knife, slashing his arm. He cursed, dropping the shovel. We hit the dirt, grappling. His hands locked around my throat, squeezing. Spots burst behind my eyes. I kicked, twisted, drove the knife into his side. He bellowed, blood spraying warm across my face.

I tore free and ran‚Äîthrough vines that clawed at my clothes, over irrigation ditches, toward the distant road. Behind me, Victor screamed my name.

A car appeared‚Äîa farmer‚Äôs truck. I waved frantically. ‚ÄúHelp! Please! He‚Äôs trying to kill me!‚Äù

The driver stopped. I stumbled toward him. Behind me, Victor froze at the vineyard‚Äôs edge. His face was pale. Then he turned and ran back into the rows.

The police came later. They searched the orchards, the fields, the irrigation ditches. They found twenty-five bodies. Men like Pablo, Manuel, Jorge. Men who vanished into the soil, swallowed by the same earth they worked.

Victor was caught weeks later, hiding near Bakersfield. He confessed to everything. Said it was ‚Äújust business.‚Äù

I left the valley soon after. But sometimes, in the stillness of dawn, I smell the vineyards again‚Äîthe mix of dirt and grape and sweat. I see the shovel glint in the sunlight. And I wonder how many more lie buried under those quiet fields, waiting for the harvest that never came.",1,1760151079.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1o3kjrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTravelers/comments/1o3kjrj/how_to_book_a_private_guided_tour_in_toledo/,How to book a private guided tour in Toledo?,"I recently spent a day exploring Toledo, Spain, and I want to share my experience booking a private tour that completely changed how I saw this historic city. If you're planning a trip to Toledo, this might save you some time and headaches.

After trying both group tours and self-guided walks in other cities, I've learned that private tours are often worth the extra cost, especially in places with rich history like Toledo. Let me explain why.

First off, Toledo isn't just another tourist destination. It's a UNESCO World Heritage site where Christian, Jewish, and Muslim cultures have left their mark over centuries. Walking through its narrow medieval streets without proper guidance means missing out on countless hidden stories and significant spots.

I found a highly-rated private tour service (you can check it out here: https://athomewave.com/Toledo) that solved many common tourist problems. Here's what made it stand out:

- Flexibility with timing (3-8 hours, you choose)
- Licensed guides who can actually take you inside monuments
- No rushing through attractions
- Customizable routes based on your interests
- Option for Madrid hotel pickup
- Small group setting (just you and your party)

The booking process was straightforward. You can reserve now and pay later, plus there's a 24-hour cancellation policy if your plans change. The tour starts from either the Toledo train station or Plaza de Zocodover - I chose the plaza since it's right in the historic center.

Price-wise, it works out well for groups up to 15 people. My family of four found it reasonable considering what we got - essentially a walking encyclopedia who showed us secret spots we'd never have found alone.

What really impressed me was how our guide adapted the tour to our pace and interests. When my mom needed a coffee break, they knew just the right local caf√©. When my history-buff dad wanted to dive deep into the Spanish Inquisition, our guide had fascinating stories ready.

Some practical tips from my experience:
- Book in advance (most people book 47 days ahead)
- Wear comfortable walking shoes (Toledo's streets are steep)
- Consider the Madrid pickup option if you're staying there
- Ask about monument tickets when booking

The tour includes all the major sites, but what's special is access to underground archaeological sites and lesser-known viewpoints that aren't in guidebooks. Our guide also helped us avoid the worst crowds by timing our visits strategically.

The most valuable aspect was having someone explain the complex history and cultural significance of what we were seeing. It's one thing to look at beautiful architecture; it's another to understand why it matters.

If you're thinking about visiting Toledo, I'd strongly recommend checking out this private tour option. The quality of guides and flexibility of the service made it worth every penny for us.

Remember, you can find all the details and current availability through the link I mentioned above. It's better to book early since the best guides tend to fill up their schedules quickly.",1,1760151077.0,WeAreTravelers,0,1.0,False
1o3kj90,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1o3kj90/resource_guide_how_to_read_the_bible_in_2025_a/,[Resource Guide] How to Read the Bible in 2025: A Comprehensive Beginner's Guide,"So many of us say we want to read the Bible ‚Äúone day.‚Äù But when that day comes, most people open Genesis, get confused by Leviticus, and give up somewhere around Numbers. You‚Äôre not alone. Whether you‚Äôre exploring faith, craving historical context, or just want to understand what shaped so much of modern society, reading the Bible is overwhelming‚Ä¶ unless you approach it strategically. This post breaks down the best advice I‚Äôve found to help make it approachable, insightful, and even meaningful.

**Tips That Actually Make Bible Reading Make Sense:**

* **Start with the Gospels, not Genesis** Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John offer a direct look at Jesus' life, teachings, and personality. Think of them as the ‚Äúmain character arc.‚Äù The Bible isn‚Äôt chronological, and starting here gives emotional clarity and context. Scholar N.T. Wright suggests Mark is the most cinematic and urgent‚Äîgreat for modern attention spans.
* **Use a modern, readable translation** The King James Version sounds poetic but outdated. The ESV and NIV are much easier to digest without losing depth. The Message is super conversational, good if you‚Äôre new or neurodivergent. Bible scholar Dr. Timothy Mackie (cofounder of *The Bible Project*) emphasizes the importance of understanding genre + context over clinging to old English.
* **Read it like a library, not a novel** The Bible isn‚Äôt one book‚Äîit‚Äôs 66. It spans poetry, prophecy, history, biography, and apocalyptic visions. Don‚Äôt treat it like a novel. Think of it more like an anthology. You‚Äôre allowed to jump around. Focus on themes that speak to your life (justice, wisdom, doubt, love, etc).
* **Don‚Äôt read alone - use commentary and community** Even seminary grads use study guides. Try podcasts like *Exploring My Strange Bible* or YouTube channels like *BibleProject*. They make weird sections (like animal sacrifices or genealogies) make sense. You‚Äôll also want to process what you read with others‚ÄîReddit, Discords, small groups, wherever. Questions are part of the process.
* **Read small, reflect slow** Don‚Äôt marathon-read. Take a few verses or a short chapter and pause. Ask: What‚Äôs happening here? What would this feel like to hear in the original culture? What does it challenge in me today? Slower = deeper. *Lectio Divina* (a monastic method) is legit powerful for this. Just Google it.
* **Wrestle with the hard parts** The Bible is raw. It includes stories of genocide, oppression, and divine judgment. Instead of skipping those parts, wrestle with them. Scholars like Pete Enns argue that the Bible reflects a developing understanding of God across history, not a flat rulebook. Let the tension teach you.
* **Pair with practices that regulate your nervous system** This is weirdly important. Reading sacred or philosophical texts can trigger existential spirals. Slow your breath, journal, walk afterward. Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman says even five minutes of reflective reading paired with grounding practices can rewire how your brain processes meaning.

**Best Resources to Help You Read the Bible Smarter:**

* **BibleProject (YouTube & Podcast)** Hands-down the most helpful visual resource out there. They explain complex themes with clarity and animation. Every book overview is like a mini masterclass. Perfect for visual learners or people who‚Äôve never touched the Bible before. Free. High quality. No fluff.
* **The Bible Recap by Tara-Leigh Cobble (Podcast + App)** This is a one-year chronological reading plan paired with daily 6‚Äì8 min podcast explanations. It‚Äôs clear, kind, and structured. Makes even Leviticus digestible. Cobble has a talent for pointing out hidden details that connect the whole story together. Great daily habit stack.
* **How Not to Read the Bible by Dan Kimball (Book)** Best-selling, funny, and totally unpretentious. Helps you make sense of bizarre or disturbing verses (like why the Bible talks about stoning people or avoiding shellfish). This book will make you question everything you *thought* you knew about scripture‚Ä¶ in a good way.
* **BeFreed** This is an AI-powered personalized learning app built by a team from Columbia University. It turns books, research, expert talks, and real-world stories into podcast-style learning plans tailored to your goals. You can pick your audio length‚Äî10, 20, or 40 minutes‚Äîand even choose your host‚Äôs voice and vibe. It adapts over time and builds a smart learning roadmap just for you. It‚Äôs stacked with Bible-related summaries, faith philosophy, ancient history, and ethical debates‚Äîbasically, if you‚Äôre trying to understand scripture in today‚Äôs world, this makes it easier to stay consistent and curious.
* **Logos Bible Software (Website + App)** This is the most powerful tool for deep-divers. You get access to thousands of commentaries, original language tools, cross-references, and historical context. It‚Äôs what seminary students use. Overkill for casuals, but amazing for serious learners.
* **Exploring My Strange Bible (Podcast by Tim Mackie)** This podcast is like going to theology class in a coffee shop. Mackie breaks down tough topics with nuance and care, but never talks down to you. He helps connect Old Testament weirdness to big themes like justice, identity, and love. No judgment zone. Great listen.
* **The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry by John Mark Comer (Book)** This book isn‚Äôt just about reading the Bible, it‚Äôs about creating space to hear from it. Bestseller. Written by a former megachurch pastor who burned out and rebuilt his life around slow living and scripture. If your life feels too chaotic to read, this will shift something in you. This is the best book on spiritual stillness I‚Äôve ever read.
* **The Naked Bible Podcast by Dr. Michael Heiser** Deep dives into theology, ancient Hebrew context, and myth-busting popular interpretations. Heiser was a scholar who made academic theology fun and mind-expanding. Ideal if you‚Äôve ever wondered what the *Nephilim* were or why certain texts were included and others weren‚Äôt.
* **ReadScripture App by Crazy Love + BibleProject** Beautiful app that combines reading plans with BibleProject animations. Pacing is great. Design is minimalist and distraction-free. The goal is to help you ‚Äúread through the Bible without falling asleep.‚Äù Mission accomplished.

They took pictures of him, and they were absolutely absurd. It looked like he was trying extremely hard to reveal himself. He even had to sit in an awkward position for his butt to even be in their line of sight. 

To make matters worse, this man, according to my daughter, was ostensibly studying with high school math YouTube videos. They took a picture of his laptop and zoomed in to see if he was doing anything productive - and he clearly put a random video on to hide his intentions. 

Does this person deserve any sort of benefit of the doubt? Should I take this to the authorities? Should I tell my daughter not to spread the pictures?

1o3keel,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1o3keel/advice_the_ultimate_guide_to_how_to_lower/,[Advice] The Ultimate Guide to How to Lower Cortisol Levels (That Actually Works),"I didn‚Äôt realize how many people in my circle were running on stress hormones until everyone I knew started saying they were ‚Äúwired but tired.‚Äù Can‚Äôt sleep. Can‚Äôt focus. Stuck in a loop. Turns out, it‚Äôs not just burnout. It‚Äôs cortisol overload.

Here‚Äôs what helped me reset.

* **You can‚Äôt outwork a stressed body.** Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist) said cortisol isn‚Äôt just ‚Äústress‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs your body‚Äôs emergency alert system. When it‚Äôs on 24/7, your immune system tanks, your sleep breaks, your belly grows, and your focus disappears. The fix? Don‚Äôt just cut work. Add real safety cues: morning sun exposure, slow walking after meals, and predictable daily structure. You need rhythm, not hustle.
* **Scrolling = low-key panic training.** Dr. Anna Lembke (author of *Dopamine Nation*) calls social media ‚Äúdigital cocaine.‚Äù Each scroll trains your brain to expect chaos and unpredictability. That spikes cortisol. Set a dopamine menu: limit doomscrolling to 30 min after dinner. Replace it with ‚Äúlow-cortisol‚Äù activities like drawing, slow music, or touching grass. Literally.
* **Don't fix your stress. Fix your blood sugar.** Cortisol spikes when your blood sugar crashes. Even if you're not diabetic. One tip from *Glucose Revolution* by Jessie Inchausp√©: Always eat fiber or protein before carbs. Oats + eggs > oats alone. Apple cider vinegar before meals works too. Cortisol doesn‚Äôt like sugar spikes.
* **Your brain needs a ‚Äúthreat off switch.‚Äù** The *Huberman Lab* podcast recommends cyclic sighing: two short inhales through your nose, one long exhale through the mouth. It‚Äôs the fastest way to drop cortisol ‚Äî faster than meditation. Do it 3 times during work breaks. Instant nervous system reset. Feels weird. Works better than coffee.
* **Perfectionism = silent cortisol trap.** ‚ÄúProductivity‚Äù isn‚Äôt the problem. Chronic self-pressure is. Psychologist Dr. Nicole LePera calls this ‚Äúfawning productivity‚Äù ‚Äî when we grind to feel safe or worthy. The fix? Let ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù be enough. Ship it messy. Rest like you mean it. High cortisol thrives on guilt.
* **Your bedroom isn‚Äôt safe enough (for your brain).** Even dim light messes with melatonin and pushes cortisol up. A *2022 Northwestern study* found that one night of sleeping with a hallway light on raised insulin resistance and cortisol in healthy adults. Blackout curtains. No phone near bed. Night = no light.
* **Alcohol is tricking you.** A chilled glass feels relaxing short-term. But when alcohol wears off, cortisol rebounds hard. That‚Äôs why you wake at 3am wired. Matthew Walker (*Why We Sleep*) explains that alcohol blocks REM sleep and makes cortisol spike during the second half of the night. Try magnesium glycinate or reishi tea instead. Better sleep. Lower cortisol.

Sharing some insanely good resources that helped me understand and fix this cortisol chaos:

* **Burnout: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle** by Emily & Amelia Nagoski This bestseller blends science and sisterhood. Emily‚Äôs a health psychologist. Amelia‚Äôs a choral conductor. Together they explain how stress isn‚Äôt just in your mind ‚Äî it‚Äôs in your *body*. You have to *complete* the stress cycle to lower cortisol. I cried reading the part on emotional exhaustion. This is *the best book I‚Äôve ever read on how to heal modern stress*.
* **Dopamine Nation** by Dr. Anna Lembke Stanford psychiatrist. Bestseller. Brutally honest about how overstimulation is the real enemy ‚Äî not laziness. The book made me rethink everything: social media, food, even work. Every chapter hit hard. This book will make you question everything you think you know about ‚Äúrelaxing.‚Äù
* **The Huberman Lab Podcast (especially the cortisol & stress series)** He breaks down complex brain science into usable tactics. His deep dives on sleep, stress, and nervous system regulation are gold. Start with the ‚ÄúControlling Stress & Anxiety‚Äù episode. The breathwork protocols and sunlight timing tips changed how I structure my entire day.
* **On Purpose with Jay Shetty: ‚ÄúWhy We Burn Out‚Äù episode with Mel Robbins** They talk about why cortisol isn‚Äôt just about stress ‚Äî it‚Äôs about disconnection. Mel explains how to rebuild rituals of joy and attention in a burnout culture. You‚Äôll leave that episode both emotional and ready to take action.
* **Dr. Andrew D. Huberman on Diary of a CEO YouTube** It‚Äôs his most viral interview. 3+ hours of science-backed life design tips. There‚Äôs a part where he talks about how trauma stores as physiological activation, and how tools like visual anchoring or cold exposure can release it. I watch this once every few months.
* **BeFreed app.** This is an AI-powered personalized learning app built by a team from Columbia University. It turns books, research, expert talks, and real-world case studies into podcasts and personalized learning plans tailored to your goals. You can choose how deep you want to go ‚Äî with 10, 20, or 40-minute episodes ‚Äî and even pick your host‚Äôs voice and tone. It learns from what you listen to and builds an adaptive study plan over time.
* **YouTube: The Holistic Psychologist** Dr. Nicole LePera's channel explains how trauma, overachieving, and burnout are linked. Her videos on self-soothing and nervous system healing are short, sharp, and validating. Especially helpful if you have a ‚Äúgo-go-go‚Äù brain and can‚Äôt shut it off.
* **The Comfort Crisis** by Michael Easter This book completely reframed how I think about ‚Äústress.‚Äù It‚Äôs about embracing discomfort to recalibrate your baseline. Think cold exposure, solo hikes, boredom. It‚Äôs an adventure book meets science journal. Insanely good read.

Obviously, we only went out once. After one date you can hardly even tell if you enjoy someone‚Äôs company. It‚Äôs just that I liked her enough to want to at least explore the possibility.

Does this timeline make sense, or am I missing stuff? How much does hashtags and memes fit into B2C marketing? I‚Äôm thinking of intermingling posts with hooks and informational content. Thoughts?

1o3k3va,https://i.redd.it/jc8pmido8euf1.jpeg,Looking for ideas for maple slab,"I have this spalted maple slab I bought over a year ago, originally my idea was to make a dining table with it but decided against it so it has sat since. 

I don't want to make it into coffee tables (I'm pretty sick of making those) so I was going to break it down to dimensional lumber to use on various projects,  but it seems like a shame to cut it up. 

I've tried selling it, for a really good price but nothing for about a year. 

Any ideas on something cool I can make with it shoot, I'm sure I just have tunnel vision.

Although I can tell a big difference between brewing Chemex with the ZP6, I can't make sense of my grind settings compared to others I'm seeing.

Here's the initial Chemex recipe. Does 3.5-4.2 sound right for the ZP6?

Grind (Medium-coarse)

ZP6: 3.5‚Äì4.2?  
C3: \~24‚Äì30 clicks?	  
  
Standard home recipe: 30g coffee, 500g water (93‚Äì95¬∞C).   
Blue Bottle recipe: 50g coffee, 700g water (93‚Äì95¬∞C). 

Bloom 45s with 100g, then:  
Pour 1: 350g (+250)  
Pour 2: 550g (+200)  
Pour 3: 500g (+150)

Target time: 4‚Äì4:30.

  
After getting that dialed in, I'd like to try the Blue Bottle (Kalita-style) dripper with this recipe:

Initial recipe: 20g coffee, 320g water (93‚Äì95¬∞C).

ive been living the same day everyday for the past 3 years, i wake up, drink coffee, go to school, come back, work on personal stuff and sleep. i wake up the next day to do it all over again. i think this is a common thing among many people, but for my case at least, it feels fruitless, stale and not very fulfilling. 

it‚Äôs a boring life. im a boring person as well. i tried to not be boring by doing something unique, and that is making a video game. but ive been constantly stuck working on it over and over again. for that reason, ive fallen behind my peers, those i know online as well i know in person.

only around last month did this really start getting to me, and it has taken a toll on me. my decision-making got worse, i'd start spending so much money on junk or cheap dopamine, i stopped studying consistently, i stopped doing things i like, like drawing. it got really bad.

i think ive reached my lowest point in life, and it's only getting lower and lower from here. im not sure how i can redeem myself at this point.

how can i get out of this hole that ive dug myself in?",2,1760149604.0,mentalhealth,0,0.76,False

Context: We met online & have been chatting for a few days on telegram of all things. Reason why she's mentioning her safeword is because we're both into k1nky stuff & I'd asked her before if she had a safeword to which she said no.

Then we talked a bit before I asked her how she's got a preferred way to go about vetting potential D0ms. And she said FT then dinner date. I asked if she likes coffee. She says yes. I say sweet, when are you free to FT? And that's where the screenshot picks up.

How am I supposed to know that's a boundary  or am I just dumb ?
