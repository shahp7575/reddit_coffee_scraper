So sad. But luckily for me I have a gas fireplace in my apartment. I'm looking for 1 lucky lady who wants to share my fireplace with me. I'll make us some hot chocolate with tiny marshmallows in it, and we can warm up under a blanket in front of the fire. Something about the idea of it seems so comforting to me.

Maybe we can even take turns massaging each other's neck and shoulders after a long day at work. Work out the stress from our bodies. I just want us to have an unforgettably good time together where we're both warm, comfortable and stress-free. Where we can talk about anything our little hearts' desire.

I have my own apartment about 20 mins away from downtown. I keep it pretty clean too. Just looking for the right lady to share it with! We don't have to start at my place though. We could meet at a Starbucks or Timmy's to get a feel for each other. Spend a little time together, get a coffee, a snack and maybe go for a little walk. If this sounds interesting to you then you might be the type of lady that I want to spend my time with. There's only one way to find out!",1,1763503848.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

1p0plnz,https://youtu.be/b1wkL1VCZuc,9 Most Disturbing TRUE Alaskan Small Town Horror Stories / Episode 01 / VESPER SHROUD,"What happens when bodies frozen for nearly a century are still warm to the touch? When dead fishermen wave from ghost ships in the fog? A medical examiner in Nome discovers three corpses from 1924 that died only days ago—their coffee still frozen in their cups, their tissues impossibly alive. But this is just the beginning of Alaska's nightmare.

In this video, you will hear about 9 absolutely terrifying true horror stories from Alaska that will make you question everything you know about death, isolation, and the frozen wilderness of America's last frontier. These are real encounters reported by medical examiners, fishermen, bush pilots, hotel workers, and police officers—ordinary people who faced extraordinary horror in the darkness and cold of Alaska.

From the medical examiner who touched a corpse that smiled at him, to the fisherman who heard his own voice broadcasting from a ghost ship, to the pilot who watched shadows crawl across his wings before his plane crashed, to the janitor who discovered 23 children still trapped in a fire from 1935—these stories will keep you awake at night. You'll hear about the ice maze that consumes children, the hotel room where a frozen bride waits forever, the tunnel where the dead scream from inside your car, and the ghost cop still walking his beat 76 years after his murder.

These aren't just scary stories—they're documented encounters with phenomena that defy explanation. Medical reports that make no sense. Radar contacts that shouldn't exist. Voices on the radio from people who've been dead for decades. And always, always the cold—that supernatural Alaskan cold that preserves things that should decay, that traps souls that should move on, that creates a thin place where the living and dead collide.

If you love true horror stories, paranormal encounters, creepy true stories, terrifying real-life experiences, haunted Alaska, supernatural mysteries, and nightmare fuel that actually happened, this video is for you. These are the kinds of stories that horror movies are based on—except they're real.

1p0pky7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifts/comments/1p0pky7/my_2025_christmas_gift_list/,My 2025 Christmas Gift List,"I realized I’ve become the person in my family who buys the good stuff for birthdays/Christmas. Every year I make people happy with the gifts that I buy. I do it by having a few simple rules;

\- Quality > Quantity  
\- Useful > Gimmicky  
\- Experience > Physical Gifts

I don’t buy BS. No “Live Laugh Love” signs, no funny for one second gadgets and no goofy meme mugs. I’m deep into the useful and lasting category.

Since multiple people asked me to upload my top picks, hereby my list.

**Quality Gifts**  
Most gifts end up in the drawer before the EOY. This list is meant as something that will last for a longer period of time.

*A premium pan ($$$/$$)* —> My personal fave is le Creuset ([http://lecreuset.com/](http://lecreuset.com/)). You can also pick a few less expensive goods like the plates. The quality is insane and will be beautiful for a very long time.  

*Premium Pillow ($$)*: My favorite pillow is the shredded memory foam pillow from Kozi Sleep ([https://www.sleepkozi.com](https://www.sleepkozi.com/)). It improved my sleep drastically over time and I still use it everyday.

*LEGO ($$)* —> ([www.lego.com](http://www.lego.com/)) This always works well within my family. We also give each other lego sets from previous years, so we don’t always have to buy new ones. It’s still a first time creating it for a lot of people. Would recommend making it somewhat of a ‘change cup’.

*Premium Olive Oil ($/$$)* —> Especially my mom really LOVES good olive oil from Spain or Italy. It really makes a difference in taste! You can find my preferred one on: [https://oliveoillovers.com](https://oliveoillovers.com/)

*Fair Trade Coffee ($)*—> Make coffee drinking a special moment with some fair trade coffee. You can find companies to order on [https://www.fairtrade.net/us-en/products/all-products/coffee.html](https://www.fairtrade.net/us-en/products/all-products/coffee.html)

*BB&B gift card ($/$$)*: give someone a little extra to use on their personal care. ([https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/c/gifts?t=70638](https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/c/gifts?t=70638)). My mom got my little sister a good bathrobe last year and she uses it until this very day. Furthermore, they’ve an annual sale on candles on Dec 6th (from 30$ for 10$).  

*Good book ($)* —> A good roman or novel always does well. Tips can be found on [r/books](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/)

**Useful Gifts**  
No one actually likes a gift that ends up in their drawer before the end of the year. Therefore, buy something that is actually useful. My top picks:

*Subscription ($$)*—> What does the person likes to do? Think about a subscription for a Netflix, Spotify, Apple Music, Costco membership or even a car wash subscription. You have no clue how happy my dad was with his car wash subscription last year.

Donation ($/$$)—> You can also use the gift to make a donation or give it to a charity of choice. Last year as a Christmas gift I received a fixed amount to spend on a charity of choice. This made me feel really happy. I personally used it to plant a tree ([https://plantatree.fs.usda.gov/tree-donation](https://plantatree.fs.usda.gov/tree-donation)). Especially someone who ‘doesn’t want anything’ will be happy with it. 

*Online course ($)* —> Examples are Udemy and Skillshare. Pick something the person is interested in. Or let them choose themselves. Make it a challenge to show what they’ve been doing during next year's celebration!

**Experiences**  
In my opinion, as I'm getting older experiences go over physical stuff any day of the week. Spending time with each other becomes more rare. Besides, most people already have a lot of stuff. A lot of people do not seek any throwaway gifts. Therefore, I would recommend to buy quality only. If someone really doesn’t want any physical gifts, you can go for an experience like:

*Car or Flight simulator ($$$)* \--> My personal favorite is the flight simulator. This in expensive, but it a very cool experience which got me in to aviation. I'm still pursuing getting my first real flight lesson!

*Date night ($/$$/$$$)*—> This can be as expensive as you want. You can go for a comedy club nearby, a concert of someone you both like or you can go to the restaurant you went together a long time ago.  It’s all about the story behind it. 

*Wonderbox gift card ($/$$)* —> Access to 90+ experiences across the US: spa, dining, city experiences. [wonderbox.com](http://wonderbox.com/) It’s flexible, so they choose what they want to do.

*Guided Local Tour or Historic Walk ($)* —> Go for a historic walk in a city nearby. You will be surprised how many fun facts you will learn about your city and/or neighborhood!

*Fishing ($)* —> My brother always love to spend time fishing. It started with us visiting the local lake and just hitting a few cold ones. Now every couple years we save for a fishing trip together. It’s not about fishing, but more about spending time together. 

**Final Note**

Most gifts are not about the actual gift itself. It's about the idea behind it. It can be as cheap or expensive as you want. The only thing that matters is that it's coming from a good heart.

I hope this list helps you pick your gifts for this year. This list is to make your life a bit easier, if it doesn't, tell me:

* who the gift is for
* age
* your budget
* and 1–2 personality traits

So I (28f) am staying with my family through the holidays. They live in a different state (11 horus away) & I work remotely so I can work from anywhere and am fortunate to be able to afford to do so. My mom (60f) is so excited I am here and while we have had our ups and downs she is very thoughtful and just enjoying having me around. 

She and my dad go out for coffee at their favorite cafe every morning and usually ask if I would like one as well. I have also offered to go pick up coffees as a way of thanking them for often buying me one. Some days I will say no as I do not always want/need caffeine and I have  grounds I like making at home too. 

Anyway...today she came back from a workout and surprised me with an  cold brew as she knows its my usual go to and I accepted and thanked her for the unexpected treat. Side note: I usually drink my coffee black or with barely a shot of milk but she added sugar to it so its much sweeter than I prefer. I don't mean this to come across as unappreciative but I hadn't really wanted a coffee today but it was so sweet I didn't want to hurt her feelings. To be honest it just isn't the end of the world and I drank about half of it anyway. A couple hours go by and she noticed that I hadn't finished it. In the past she may have said something like ""are you still drinking that?"" or something of the like... but instead she was like ""ugh can you at least go throw it out... this is why I don't get you things""

I was really taken back because while I can maybe understand her maybe being disappointed in having spent the money on something that I didn't fully consume, this isn't a ""habit"" of mine. Like I said before I typically get asked before hand and decline. 

Idk maybe my feelings were just hurt a little bc the gesture meant alot to me... 

AITA for either not drinking it or not saying something when she first gave it to me? While I love her to bits I am worried (based on out past ups & downs) that if I make a bigger deal out of it than what i described above it will turn into or escalate into something unnecessary. 

(perhaps just a simple apology ffrom me even tho I might feel it silly would suffice)

thoughts?

We’re exploring the idea of a *digital loyalty card* app where you could collect stamps/points from multiple cafés, restaurants and shops **all in one place**.

No more paper cards — everything would be digital.

You’d just show a personal QR code at checkout, the staff scans it, and after a certain number of stamps you get a reward (free coffee, discount, etc.)

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip.

1p0p7kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p0p7kp/mixed_signals_or_am_i_overthinking_this/,Mixed signals or am I overthinking this?,"I 33M started dating 23F.

We met online and started texting since September. Here's a summary:

* We had 2 video calls. First was quite formal because she wanted to be safe because I was a stranger she met online. The second video call was 6 hours into the night to the point where she almost fell asleep and said ""Can I sleep in your arms?"". But then her texting goes a bit cold again after a day or two. Due to these 2 phone calls I thought that I should give her a chance despite the age gap.
* We managed to go out on a date after about a month. We went on a walk for 2 hours. It went well. She felt really affectionate, we talked a lot. We laughed a lot. I grabbed her hand and we held hands for the date. She then hugged me goodbye and said we should meet again and was very affectionate while texting the next 2 days. But then again it became 2-3 messages per day.
* A few days later we went out to a restaurant. She bought me a necklace since it was my birthday a few days prior. Then she came to my place and we watched a movie and cuddled. We talked a lot. At the end we kissed passionately to the point where she missed the bus. It didn't get to sex because she said ""it's too early"" and that she's old fashioned when it comes to dating. Which is fine for me and I respect that.
* We waited for the bus and she said ""Can we talk honestly to each other?"" And I said of course. What's bothering you? She said the age gap bothers her (we have a 10 years age gap). And I said what specifically the number itself? And she said no, but we are at different stages in life. So she would like to know me better before jumping into something. I assume that this means that I'm in my career already and she doesn't know what to do yet or where our future leads to. She might start university next year. She's currently working and taking some courses as preparation for uni. She's very busy with this.
* We talked about exclusivity and that we don't see other people or talk to other people. After that she texted me that she really enjoyed being with me. She also said she liked me and likes talking to me. I reciprocated since I feel the same way towards her.
* Her mom knows about me and her sisters but I have not met them. My closest friends know about her and parts of my family. My social circle was very supportive and said I should not reject her based upon her age if things go well.
* I may add that she said she is highly introverted to the point where her ideal weekend would be in her room at home and not leaving it. So maybe that throws me off a little how she can be so affectionate in person over phone calls and shortly after?
* We were supposed to meet on Saturday but she fell sick. So we couldn't meet and haven't met in 2 weeks. But we had some long phone calls.
* We both were raised with Christian values but we don't really believe anymore.
* She lives about an hour away from me.

Given the above to me it always seems that after long calls she is very warm and affectionate and almost like she falls in love. The same on the 2 dates we had and after the dates. But then after a day or two she pulls back which to me seems unnatural. As if her natural state would be to be affectionate and in love but she somehow stops herself artificially. Of course I will ask her this directly but I like to ask something like this in person because then I can read the situation much better.

I never experienced this type of dating behavior. To me at this point I would be in a relationship already in my prior dating experience. I've been in long term relationships all the time since 16.

I may add that I've never dated this big of an age gap. But she seems mature and we have lots of things to talk to. Our views on dating align. I personally wouldn't mind if she is going to uni or work. I have a very good career as a data scientist with a PhD so to me it wouldn't matter if she works at a coffee shop or becomes a lawyer.",1,1763502892.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Our connection has been on and off, not because of him but because of me. At first I didn’t feel a spark and ended things, but we kept talking here and there. I still don’t feel a huge amount of chemistry, but I want to give him a real chance.

I wrote him off after our first meeting without really getting to know him, but he’s been persistent, genuinely serious, and overall a really nice person, so I want to see where this goes.

When we first met, I didn’t give him a hug. I had recently experienced abuse and wasn’t comfortable with physical contact, though I didn’t tell him that at the time. He was fine with it, and honestly, because of our cultural background, minimal physical contact is normal. The most I’d ever do was give him a quick fist bump to say hi and bye, and he never questioned it. He just matched my pace without pushing anything. Over the past two years we’ve met for casual coffees, but nothing more.

I’ve been on plenty of dates since, but this specific date is making me really nervous. We’re dressing up fancy, heels and everything, and I’m worried about how I’ll react if he tries to kiss me.

Has anyone been in a situation like this? How do you navigate it without feeling pressured?

Now fast forward to today …in October I was drinking coffee every day for a week. It honestly was just a good ass week , I didn’t feel sick or anything while drinking coffee. Then Towards the end of October I kept having heart palpitations. Then comes chest pain. I winded up going to the er. 2 EKG’s, blood test , and chest xray Went fine and all was perfect. This hospital visit was October 29th. 

It’s Nov 18, the heart palps went away but now i experience constant chest pain. Like dull achy burning feeling. This can be left side where my heart is or at least feels like it( any pain on my left side feels like I have a cramp in my heart ). middle sternum area , and right side of chest. I taste sourness in mouth. Constant chest throat spasms? Feels like a heart palp but in sternum and it takes my breath away. I have a cough as well. Sore throat sometime as well. 

My 2 questions are : is this normal , like everyone says what they eat or what they physically do (like lay down) affects them. Where mine is constant pain. If I ate a full pizza then drank hella soda I wouldn’t feel much different. Not better but not worse.my pain is constant from the time I wake up and time I go to bed with no relief.  So what gives ? 

Second question: my gi doc ran out of ppis for me to try. Last one to try is protonix , how ever I’m suppose to get manometry test where I get 2 tubes down my nose. One they said to check for swallowing  and another that says in for the day to check my stomach ph. This just seems very scary and idk if I’ll be able to do them , is there literally anything else to check besides doing something like this. Just seems alittle to invasive.

I’m not here to celebrate candles. I’m here to separate float tricks from businesses that might actually compound. Read fast, think slow.



* **NXXT**



Premarket got knifed when algos read “loss” and “EPS miss,” dumped on cue, and ignored the arc of the story. Then humans showed up. From 1.30 at the low to a grind back into the 1.55 to 1.62 pocket, roughly a 20 percent intraday swing with buyers defending into the close. That is not hype, that is order flow changing hands.



The real test is simple. NXXT is trying to graduate from fuel-only to an energy bundle: mobile fueling, on-site power, charging, software, SLAs. If they show rising contracted revenue, improving margin mix, and a pipeline walking through real stages (site control to permits to interconnect to PPA to NTP to COD), the multiple follows. If the next updates are adjectives without milestones, it stays a momentum rental. Mark 1.55 as the first tell. If that holds on a retest and a project moves one box to the right, I press. If not, I step aside.



* **SGBX**



The float is small, the chants are loud, and the chair count can change while you blink. Threads talk about “owning the float.” Those same threads whisper dilution and share authorizations. That is the game. It can rip, but the supply curve is not sacred. I treat green moves as inventory to sell into strength, not a love story. One 8-K can turn a squeeze into a spill.



* **MSAI**



AI in the ticker, friction in the borrow. Price reacts to headlines first, P&L later. If you trade it, your edge is in the mechanics: locate cost, intraday volume vs 10 day average, and whether any named customer contract shows up as gross margin improvement. No proof, no hold. It is a news tape with a hair trigger.



* **CTM**



Government IT with a cyber tint. You will see “profitable quarter” and “backlog up” used like incense. Good, not gospel. The upgrade path is boring and that is why it works: two consecutive quarters where operating cash flow confirms earnings. Until then, I trade contract prints and respect the prior breakout as my level that matters.



* **CYDY**



Crowd heat, thin book. When the room gets quiet, spreads widen and exits shrink. There is no shame in trading it small and fast. There is plenty of shame in pretending it is a fundamental swing without filings to back it.



* **EONR**



True penny territory around the half-dollar zone. Classic routine: pop, stall, fade. If there is no fresh filing with terms, assume repetition. The only reason I touch it is to scalp around prior day high and VWAP with tight risk. Otherwise it is background noise.



* **SCWO**



Living on echoes of old DD. Nostalgia is not a catalyst. If there is no new paper, I assign it zero weight. Save your ammo for when an 8-K lands.

**My playbook for this tape**



* One catalyst, one bet. If you need three things to go right, your size is wrong.
* Risk lives on the chart. Use a closing line, not a feeling.
* Position 1 to 3 percent per name. If you want excitement, buy coffee.
* Green days pay the bills. Scale out into strength and let the rest prove it.
* Never average down into fresh supply. Shelves, convert notes, and bid-price notices do not care about your conviction.



**Snapshot conclusions**



* NXXT: algos sold the headline, real money bought the plan. Bounce off 1.30 into 1.55 to 1.62 says real buyers. Hold 1.55 and advance a project stage and this can build a higher base.
* SGBX: squeeze material with a dilution tripwire. Treat it like nitro, not water.
* MSAI: borrow math plus headlines. Contract proof or it stays a trade.
* CTM: some substance, needs cash conversion to earn a rerate.
* CYDY, EONR, SCWO: crowd waves that only matter when filings land.

I’m very very new to this subject so I would appreciate any support where possible. I’m beginning to build a coffee product and I’m currently going through the early stages of r&d and prototyping formulas, however my issue is that I’ve first took to e-commerce simply trying to white label an existing product with some minor tweaks (literally the bread and butter of this whole industry), and these tweaks are essentially going to be what my whole brand is about. However through some initial tests from oversea manufacturers (alibaba), the product is pretty rubbish, so I’ve now taken to contacting a ‘proper’ food lab that can help establish my product, Nottingham university food innovation centre. 

Now, I’ve only exchanged a few emails, but they’re giving me ball park figures of between 2-5k, which is obviously quite a large sum especially when I was initially expecting to simply flip an existing product and hope it was all going to be fine.

Has anyone been through the same process that I’m now currently going through? I’m at a bit of a crossroads for pursuing this brand/product idea as it’s a big risk especially when paying this much just for r&d. Are there other routes I could follow? Shall I just pull out while I’m ahead and maybe look for a different product to develop that simply is a white label process? Or from experience do you think at this stage that this is really what sets brands apart from the rest?

Any advice on other things I should be considering would be much appreciated.

For most of its life, we lived in Houston, Texas. There I filled its reservoir with filtered water from the fridge, and never had any issue with its tank sensor. 

When we moved this summer to Durham, North Carolina I continued this methodology, but found relatively soon that the machine would report an empty tank when the tank was clearly not empty. 

At this point I learned that the sensor required a certain degree of mineral content in the water to function. I was advised by SeattleCoffeeGear (from whom I bought the machine) to add some tap water to the tank, which resolved it for a bit -- until it didn't. I ended up just shifting to ALL tap water, which has mostly kept me caffeinated for a month or so now. 

Except now, it's often insisting the tank is empty despite being full of tap water. That's getting annoying.

What are my options here? I mean, we'll buy a house and I'll plumb this machine into the water supply within six months, but for now I'm still stuck on the tank fill, and dammit I need coffee. ;)",1,1763502408.0,rocketespresso,0,1.0,False

New here on the group. Wanted to share something I have been working for months (With help with AI). Is basecally a VST3 plugin to review drum midi files, be able to make grooves using a timeline, and then to be able to drag and drop into a DAW. It is important to mention this is on Beta. This is what I needed after EZ Player was not supported anymore. You can select the target drum VSTi and the plugin will remap the midi for that particular VSTi in rteal time. Right now the Drum VSTis included are:

* GeneralMIDI
* SuperiorDrummer3
* AddictiveDrums2
* Battery4
* EZdrummer
* GetGoodDrums
* StevenSlateDrums
* Ugritone
* BFD3
* MTPowerDrumKit2
* DrumGizmo
* Sitala
* KrimhDrums
* TheMonarchKit
* ShreddageDrums
* Damage2
* Triaz
* MODO Drum
* Drum Locker

You can also bypass remapping. Also you can manipulate the BPM at the timeline level or when reviewing the midis in the browser, before dragging. Everything is quite intuitive, but for dragging from the groovebrowser you need to hold ""Control"".

I am having already nightmares about this plugin, so I kindly ask if you can check it out, and provide feedback or issues. This is FOSS so totally free to use, but you can always buy me a coffee if you want , would help me a lot to also work on other ideas I have.

Windows MacOS & Linux supported.

Changes in version 0.9.7

Fixes:

1.- Fixed wrong ENUM used for target library causing issues with remapping.  
2- Zoom fixed. (Timeline with artifacts when zooming in/out & incorrect zoom focus)  
3.- Fixed issue where the ""Disected"" MIDIs had a wrong lenght calculation.  
4.- Thread Safety - Playhead Position Access fixed  
5.- Timer Callback Optimization  
6.- CriticalSection Usage Scope Optimization

New:

1p0opjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/1p0opjw/there_are_many_songs_about_obes/,There are many songs about OBEs,"I always found it interesting how many of the Gizz songs reference out of body experiences or just the idea of being separated from your body, experiencing something beyond ourselves. Concepts of things like enlightenment and nirvana often show up as well.

I’ll list examples below.  I find it interesting especially how vocal Stu is about not believing in god. Perhaps he’s had a few OBEs and found just a void and nothing more. Some people after OBEs have a firmer belief in a concept of some sort of god. Not usually like a biblical god but something ya know?. Is god truly in the rhythm??? But this isn’t a discussion about if god is real not just an examination about all these sorts of ideas throughout the king gizzard discography.  

I’m sure there are much more than what I have below, that are less obvious and more nuanced as sometimes their lyricism is hard to interpret. Especially on albums like The Silver Cord. 

Anyways just have always found this to be one of my favorite parts of Gizz and wanted hear what the rest of the community thought about it. Have a good day yall!!! :)


No Body



I floated up
And for the first time I could
Relax and unplug
My friend, it felt good
To shuffle off this mortal coil
To rise like oil in water
To be not real
To have no soul
To have no body
I woke to an eye-adjusting fright
Baptised in the light
And found myself
In purgatory white
Dead again in the void
What was the lesson, God?
No, no, no, no body
Are you real or not?
No, no, no, no body
In death I know
Life was a hallucination


Aerodynamic



Oh, this land-borne curse clings to you like algae
If only you were a star, you'd be not sedentary""
I said, ""I have always wondered
If I could step out of my body
Would I be a fish out of water
Or like a school in harmony?


Catching Smoke


Give me five
It's all I need to inscribe my epitaph
While I float O.B.e.
Am I dead or just paranoid?


Shanghai


Neck stuck from looking up
At the high-rise buildings trying to caress
Enlightenment through an out-of-body experience
You're thriving in this environment


Float Along Fill Your Lungs

I saw you in the carpet shades
Then I felt you like a baby's face
Just float along and fill your lungs
Float along and breathe a deep breath
When I saw you in the paper folds
Then I saw you in my coffee mug
Just float along and fill your lungs
Float along and breathe a deep breath


The Fourth Color


Rising up out of my body
I am omnipresent for thee
Many fingers, many minds and
Many eyeballs puppet my feet
I walk the streets holy
And see all that has been
All that will be
Third eye is free
I am not a body
Tetrachromacy
I believe the hyperbole
I see the fourth colour
I'm born again
I see the light
It's in my face
I am analysing information
Now I am a god


Chang’e


On the astral planes they dance
Traversing through the broad expanse
Transcending mortal coil
To be whole once and for all


The silver cord


From the womb I materialize
Terrified, uncircumcised
My mothers love, Hypericum
Awake for the caesarean
Like a dog on a freeway
I commit my life to end it my way
I am deaf, I am a mute, I am blind
And I have broken through
I am a vessel
I'm just a poor boy travelling with my bodies
Bodies, body imagery, imagery
I am free, I am marooned and tied to my bodies
Bodies, body imagery, imagery


Head on pill



Just yesterday I sat across from my legs
They weren't connected to me
And I couldn't see cause my eyes were in me
Hold me up straight while I screw my
Head on



Pansych

One is all and all is one

1p0ojrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1p0ojrr/i_dont_know_how_i_respect_myself_so_little/,I don't know how I respect myself so little.,"There's a really REALLY attractive guy at my work. Insanely hot. I started recently and he's been following me around, joking with me, flirting with me, making it clear he was somewhat interested. As someone who never gets male attention I was super into it, and he was hilarious too. 

I knew he was flirting with other girls and it didn't bother me. I knew we weren't going to DATE. My self worth is at an all time low after dropping out of college and withdrawing from many of my relationships. I've been socially, politically, academically exhausted. 

This guy is MAGNETIC. He is the epitome of charisma. Of course he radiates fuckboy. And he's everything I don't need. He has a past in another city he's running from and I don't need the chaos. 

Anyway, he asked me for a drink on Saturday. We went. He said he'd pay for everything, he was putting on a perfect gentleman front. At some point, there was an issue with the card he was using and he didn't have another. I know he has the money, he could prove that, so we just decided to use my card and he'd transfer whatever we spent. I'm not used to having a man pay for me so I was a little swept off my feet. I give him my card for the day as I can tell he'd embarrassed by the thought of being seen with the woman paying. Maybe that was a red flag. 

Everything's going GREAT. We get lunch, coffee, drinks, play a game somewhere and get more drinks, he kissed me here. First kiss ever btw. I've been focused on academics so hard I've ignored every chance I ever had with a boy. He was confident and it was electric. 

We walk through the city and with his arm around me, he's smiling and being generally nice. We end up at the beach. He picks me up to be cute and trips in the sand. We go flying into the sea and I said I wish I could take a shower (my hair was quickly tangling with wet sand). He says I'll pay for a hotel, don't worry. 

Of course I know this is gearing up for sex. At this point I wanted it. We'd been flirting for a while now and he was genuinely making me feel so appreciated. We get to the hotel. I shower. One thing leads to another, he's giving me oral. Mind you he knows he's my first. He tells me he's only been with a handful of women before and nobody in this city. Knowing what he's like now, I think that was a lie.

I don't need the lecture. I fucked up. We used no protection. He was just so gentle and amazing at the time. We did have condoms, but they didn't fit him at all (literally couldn't get them on him) and I guess we got tunnel vision. I remember feeling detached during the actual sex but after he was amazing. We talked in bed for SIX HOURS, he told me all night how beautiful I was and he lay me on his chest and played with my hair, kissed my head, whispered sweet nonsense into my ear, make jokes that made us both laugh a little too loud for the hour. This went on ALL NIGHT. We had sex again at one point. We had common ground, and we had multiple really deep conversations. He stared into my eyes and called my own eyes beautiful, called me 'his girl'.

Being that he was my first kiss and my first sexual experience all in one night, I was definitely overwhelmed. Sleeping on his chest was probably the most peaceful moment I've had in years, laying there playing with his necklace while he stroked my hair. He told me to come to drinks with our co-workers the next night, he'd kiss me in front of everyone. A little performative and cringe but whatever, I thought. He says he doesn't mind if anybody finds out, he doesn't care, he likes me. You can imagine, every girl at work is obsessed with him.

When we woke up on Sunday morning he was the same. A little rougher when he spoke, but he was exhausted and he had work in 2 hours and he'd had basically no sleep. We had sex AGAIN in the morning. I know. I have made bad decisions. I am aware now. 

We Uber back to his because he needs to grab his work uniform and take a quick shower. He sends me back off in the same car, and we lean in to say goodbye. I go to kiss his lips. He diverts and kissed my cheek, barely. 

I get home. I text him I had a great time. He replies the same, says 'we'll have to do this again soon'. 

And then he GHOSTS ME. FOR TWO DAYS. All I texted was shit like how are you, did you rest after work, do you wanna talk later.

I'm off work this week. A close friend from work who I've known years before I got this job says that today, Tuesday, the boy has come into work with his eye all bust up, bloody and swollen. He was absent Monday. 

Crucially,

- Work friend KNOWS about the sex.
- Work hookup KNOWS that work friend knows.

 Hookup guy says vaguely to work friend when pushed about his face injury, ""Honestly, I regret the whole weekend."" 

Well... I was most of the weekend. 

Now of course I'd been hoping he was just busy. He does work 70+ hours a week (yes, another red flag...). 

But what is WRONG WITH ME? I can't let go of it. I KNOW to him it meant nothing. I don't want to BE WITH HIM, I just like him. We're not compatible long-term, I knew that while we were talking. But he just made me feel so good about myself. 

But dude, what's the plan? We work together. We see eachother all day, every day. You even said 'let's do this again'. But you OWE ME HUNDREDS THAT YOU'RE NOT PAYING BACK, AND YOU'RE IGNORING ME. After telling me 'you're so beautiful', and even 'you're mine' and at one brief moment in the night he laughed after I made a joke and said he loved me - of course, not in the literal full meaning. But it connotes at least some affection. 

Of course, now I know he's a liar - which YES, I should have known before - I have to get tested. I have no idea how many people's he's been with and he didn't love the question in the moment either. 

I fucked up. I don't respect myself. I've been so low and lonely and have had such self esteem issues. It was one night of comfort and it helped me until the ghosting started. 

But here's the fucked up part - I'm worried about him. Clearly I've got some sort of attachment issues, but I worry about his injury, even though I should know he went out drinking, fucked around, found out. Other (male) coworkers speculate he's incredibly lonely. 

I 👏 CAN'T 👏 FIX 👏 HIM. 👏

He disrespected me so hard and I'm over here worried about his mental state??? What is wrong with me. Jesus fucking Christ. Do I have no regard for my own dignity? 

Well. I go back to work on Sunday. I have to see him every day knowing he regrets me. 

God, I fucked up. I fucked up so hard. I knew I was fucking up when he first got on top of me with no protection. But the hours of talking after made it all feel better. But I FUCKED UP. I FUCKED UP. I. FUCKED. UP!

He would absolutely know I was talking about him if he found this but I doubt he uses Reddit. But I'm going crazy

I'm stuck between 'fuck that motherfucker' and 'I can fix him'. 

But to hear someone REGRETS you so soon - your FIRST? That fucking SUCKS. 

I know I won't care for too long, but right now, I just need to let it all out. 

Thank you if you read my pitiful wailing. 

Never again. NEVER again.

Financial Position:
- As of December 31, 2024, total assets were $5.17 million, down from $5.59 million at September 30, 2024.
- Cash & cash equivalents dropped significantly to $124,715 (from $464,222 at September 30, 2024).
- Inventory remained high at $4.61 million, consistent with the prior quarter.
- Current liabilities totaled $3.64 million (down sharply from $6.24 million at September 30, 2024) due to repayment of short-term loans ($433,512 vs. $1.92 million previously) and conversion of convertible notes to equity.
- Stockholders’ equity turned positive at $1.53 million (vs. a deficit of $650,668 last quarter), reflecting significant new equity issuances.

Operating Results:
- Revenues for the quarter were only $22,853, a decline of $943,079 or 97.6% from $965,932 in the prior-year quarter, due to discontinued U.S. coffee operations and a shift to new health-focused maca-based products in Asia.
- Gross profit plummeted to $15,479 from $124,534 (down 87.6%), but gross margin rose to 67.7% due to the low cost of goods relative to revenue.
- Operating expenses decreased 29.3% year-over-year to $1.52 million ($2.15 million prior-year), primarily reflecting reduced personnel and administrative costs after business restructuring.
- Net loss totaled $1.54 million, improved from a $2.15 million loss a year earlier, but still substantial on the very low revenue base.
- Comprehensive loss, including foreign currency impact, was $1.73 million (vs. $2.11 million prior-year).

Cash Flow & Liquidity:
- Net cash used in operating activities was $1.34 million, mainly reflecting the operating loss and inventory buildup.
- No material investing activities occurred this quarter.
- Financing activities provided $1.19 million, mainly from issuance of common stock ($2.0 million) and convertible notes ($678,308), offset by loan repayments.
- Cash at period-end is low, underscoring liquidity constraints.

Capital & Funding Events:
- Over the quarter, the company issued about 5.8 million shares via a mix of equity placements, compensation, and warrant exercises.
- Major subsequent events include a $10 million convertible note/warrant deal (closed January 2025; 19.5 million shares issued upon conversion) and a $1.07 million equity sale (6 million shares) in June 2025, materially increasing share count.
- As of August 19, 2025, 36,397,418 shares are outstanding, a sharp increase from 10,739,800 at December 31, 2024.

Risks and Uncertainties:
- CIMG operates with recurring losses and negative cash flow; accumulated deficit stands at $83.88 million.
- Ongoing doubts exist over its ability to continue as a going concern absent successful additional fundraising.
- Recent business model pivot (to Asian functional beverages) is nascent and not yet generating meaningful revenues.
- The company faced a Nasdaq listing deficiency due to late filings and low share price; extensions have been granted but continued listing is at risk.
- Legal risks include ongoing litigation (Kim Litigation and ex-directors lawsuit) which could lead to further costs.
- Heavy reliance on large equity and convertible note issuances for ongoing liquidity, creating significant dilution for existing shareholders.

Operations and Market:
- Operations for the quarter focused on the launch of the Maca Series products in Asia (energy drinks, coffee, and supplements).
- No meaningful sales in North America, the prior core market.
- Customer concentration risk: In Q1 2025, one customer (LXM) accounted for 59% of revenue.

Conclusion:
CIMG Inc. is in a transitional, high-risk phase with declining legacy revenue and a material shift toward new Asian-focused products. Operations remain unprofitable and cash consumption is high. Continued viability depends heavily on external capital; the recently completed large equity and note financings have alleviated immediate liquidity needs but at the cost of heavy dilution. Investors should closely monitor the company's ability to generate sustainable revenue from its new product lines and maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements.

Hi all,

I’m a Balikbayan — born and raised in the Philippines but haven’t lived in the country in over 30 years. I’ve been visiting every two years for the past decade, so I’m familiar but not familiar with BGC. I know the general feel of the area, but I’m not up-to-date on which buildings/streets are the best to stay in.

I’ll be in Manila from January 7 to 19 and looking for Airbnb/condo recommendations in BGC that fit these criteria:
	•	Walking distance to good places to eat
	•	Close to decent coffee shops and ideally a whisky bar or wine bar
	•	Not directly on a main road (trying to avoid heavy traffic noise)
	•	Near Uptown Mall
	•	Near a park or at least a nice walkable area
	•	Walkable to and from Bonifacio High Street
	•	Located on a quiet street
	•	Safe to walk at night

If you have specific condo buildings, Airbnb listings, or even recommended blocks/areas within BGC that match this vibe, I’d really appreciate it. Also open to any “avoid this building/area” advice if certain spots are especially noisy or not great for walking at night.

1p0ohyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1p0ohyp/my_story_in_case_it_resonates_with_someone/,my story - in case it resonates with someone,"I don't know how many of you are familiar with the music, but Blake Schwarzenbach wrote a lovely, romantic song about alcohol once called, ""Kiss the Bottle"". The chorus is such a banger: ""I kissed the bottle. I should have been kissing you. You wake up to an empty night, with tears for two.""

I have been drinking for 30 years. I am what people like to call a ""functioning alcoholic"" although I haven't been self-referential in that way until very recently. I am also, fortunately or unfortunately, a ""happy drunk"". Drinking does not make me sad or depressed. I also don't tend to drink in excess. I am one of those who can have ""a glass or two of wine"", and it really is just a glass or two...

...but for 30 years, 5 to 7 evenings per week? This isn't healthy. This is alcoholism.

None of my romantic partners have ever even hinted that I've had a problem. My wife of seven years has specifically said, ""you are not at all an alcoholic"", and one of my best, dearest friends (like with the alcohol, a friend for 30 years) has said about me, ""I would not consider you an alcoholic."" He manages a substance abuse treatment center. This is how high-functioning and high-masking my alcoholism presents.  

Currently, I am 45 days sober. For the last 3 or 4 years, age has caught up to me, and although I can still do cardio exercise for 8 to 15 hours per week, I find that my body is breaking down in ways I had feared but had not entirely anticipated. After a day of hard exercise on a Saturday, I will drink up to a half a bottle of red wine, typically by myself. This replaces water and electrolytes in some cases, and my recovery from the effort is severely compromised. 

When I wake up on Sunday, I can usually exercise again with friends if I want to, or if I have other plans, that's fine too. But the thing is, I am ALWAYS masking. I never feel quite right. I never feel entirely healthy. Some part of me always feels some kind of fatigue, and sometimes I have to endure uncomfortable nausea. In the evenings, I am the one who has to leave the social gathering early. 

For me, I think that I've always leaned on alcohol in order to avoid uncomfortable thoughts, feelings or ruminations. And for me (again, fortunately or unfortunately), it works. But now, I have been to the ER after losing consciousness 3 times in 4 years. The doctors run all the tests, but they can never find anything truly wrong with me. Spoiler alert: it's alcoholism. I am even good at mostly hiding it from blood tests. 

It's also true that I have suffered from high blood pressure for the last 7 years and was even put on hydrochlorothiazide, a mild diuretic. This can also be directly attributed to alcohol since when I have ever quit for a month, my blood pressure has been entirely normal. I have been willing to take meds rather than just live clean. 

Since the pandemic, there were occasional times when I found myself putting wine instead of coffee in my coffee cup for Zoom meetings. Maybe that was just a once per month thing, but it happened. If I ever found myself pouring myself a glass of wine at lunch, I would almost always have to nap. I would not continue to drink and then wouldn't drink in the evening, but is that better or worse? It's like I keep the band aid always halfway on my proverbial wound. 

At this point, alcohol has not killed me, but I know it could and might. I also know that I get almost twice as much done at work when I'm sober. I also tend to communicate more with my partner and my friends. I also feel more amorous toward my partner and am just better at connecting in general because I don't have wine to lean on. This time, my ""break from wine"" feels like ""quitting alcohol altogether"", and I really hope that's true. I am tired of beating myself up mentally and emotionally in the mornings, and if I ever had to go to the ER again from losing consciousness, I don't think I could ever forgive myself.

It started out well only to have it turn into an interrogation. As she came through the door I immediately recognized her and was struck by her good looks in person, her warm smile and air of calmness. We chatted comfortably for maybe 10 minutes about nothing in particular. Dating at our age being a minefield was one topic. Things were going well until she mentioned a social group she belonged to. I had heard of the group through an old work acquaintance. A one-time customer I haven't seen in years had mentioned this group to me and I casually asked her if she knew him. Knew him! In a metropolitan area of 1.4 Million people I pulled the one name out of a hat that could kill the mood. I hadn't seen him in 15 years and she's a complete stranger to me. What are the odds? Well that changed the whole vibe and what followed was unpleasant. Conversation continued with us both smiling and being perfectly polite. But she becomes focused on digging up my flaws. I have flaws. I think everyone in our age group will have things in their past that you would want to plead the fifth on.  She is a smart woman and knows the right questions to ask. So no more than 5 minutes after my one-in-a-million question, she's come up with the Red Flag that is a deal breaker. What it is doesn't matter - I think there are some red flags that are forgivable or acceptable if a relationship takes root. Well fuck! No fault to her though as I have no doubt she's a good person. In addition to the fellow she broke up with she is also a widow. I'm sure that influences her. I wished her well and we went our separate ways.

Ever feel like you're playing life on 'hard mode' and can't find the cheat codes? I've been there. You want to make big changes, but the idea of a total life overhaul is just... exhausting.

But what if leveling up isn't about one giant leap? What if it's about making tiny, almost unnoticeable 'software updates' to our daily routines? These are the simple optimizations that lead to massive gains in happiness and success over time.

Here are a few things that have been game-changers for me:

*   **Treat Failure as Data.** This one is huge. When something doesn't work out, it's not a 'Game Over' screen. It's just a data point. It's the game telling you, ""try a different strategy."" Getting rejected for a job? Awesome data. A side project flopped? More data. When you stop seeing failure as a reflection of your worth and start seeing it as **valuable intel**, you become unstoppable.

*   **The 1% 'Energy' Rule.** Forget trying to be 100% productive all day. It's a myth. Instead, identify the 1% of your day where you have the most energy and creativity (for me, it's that first hour after coffee). **Protect that time fiercely.** Use it for your most important task. The rest of the day can be for smaller, less demanding things. You'll be amazed at how much more you accomplish by honoring your natural energy cycles instead of fighting against them.

*   **Patch Your Internal 'Bugs'.** Let's be real, it's tough to optimize your outer world if your inner world is chaotic. We all have mental 'bugs' or emotional baggage that slow us down and drain our resources. Addressing these is the ultimate life hack. For anyone needing a more guided approach to get their emotional 'OS' running smoothly, I've found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** to be incredibly helpful for creating a clear plan. It's like having a roadmap for your own mind.

Ultimately, maximizing our lives is about making small, intentional choices every single day. It’s not about perfection; it’s about progress.

So, what's one small 'optimization' you've made recently that had a surprisingly big impact? Let's share some intel. 👇",1,1763501080.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1p0oep1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LAsocial/comments/1p0oep1/r4r_introducing_yourself/,R4R - Introducing Yourself,"Introducing yourself is the easiest way to start building connections and start making friends. r/LASocial is for **friendship-only**, and your R4R (Redditor-for-Redditor) intro post helps others figure out whether you share interests, live nearby, or would enjoy hanging out.

##Where do you live?

**Let people know your general area.** You don’t need to be hyper-specific, but LA is huge and traffic is real. Just list your neighborhood or region:

* Koreatown
* Pasadena
* The Valley
* Westside
* CSUN


## What are your interest? What's your personality?

**Share some details about yourself** so others know what you’d enjoy doing together. People appreciate honesty and clarity:

* “I’m mid-30s, into hiking, museums, indie films, and trying new food spots.”
* “I'm a CSUN student who loves gaming, board games, coffee shops, and casual chill hangs.”
* “I just moved here. I like concerts, traveling, and creative hobbies.”

Also feel free to include things like:

* introvert / extrovert
* night owl / early bird
* social anxiety or comfort level




## What kind of social experience are you looking for?

**Let people know what you're looking for.** This helps set expectations and makes it easier for the right people to connect with you. This is what you're looking for in other people Some examples:

* “Looking for casual hangs and weekend hikes.”
* “Hoping to find people for creative sessions or photography walks.”
* “Interested in forming a small friend group.”
* “Would love to join game nights or board-game cafés.”

You can be as general or specific as you like.



## A Friendly, Low-Pressure Opener

**End your intro with something inviting yet casual.** This signals that you’re approachable without committing to anything:


* “If you share any of these interests, feel free to reach out.”
* “DMs or comments are fine — I’m chill either way.”
* “Open to meeting people nearby for low-key hangs.”

# Comment on other R4R posts

**The fastest way to make friends is to engage with others**. Don’t just wait for people to come to you- comment on their intros, too! Commenting shows initiative and helps you discover who’s active, friendly, and nearby:

* “Hey, we live close by and share a few interests.”
* “I’m also into hiking — want to join a group walk sometime?”
* “I’m in the same area! Always down to try new food spots.”

# Remember: You are never obligated to meet anyone.

* Posting an R4R is not a commitment.
* You can respond as much or as little as you like.
* You can talk without meeting in person.
* You can say no to plans without feeling bad.
* Don't include sensitive information in your post
* Take things at your own pace.

# [Sample Template]

>#[R4R] 26M | Los Feliz | Looking for friends for hikes, food, and chill hangs

>Hey everyone! I’m a 26 year-old guy who just moved to Los Feliz. I’m into hiking, movies, trying new restaurants, and exploring random neighborhoods around LA. I also play on a gay rugby team (LA Rebellion) if that's something that interests you.

> I’d love to meet people who are into casual weekend adventures, checking out coffee spots, or even just hanging out at a park. I’m a bit introverted at first but warm up quickly, and I was thinking about going to Jumbo's Clown Room for the first time next week.

> If you’re nearby or share similar interests, feel free to comment or DM! Always happy to meet chill new people.

# Final Tips

* Be honest and specific- vague intros get fewer replies
* Highlight your general location
* Mention a few easy shared activities
* Keep your vibe friendly, not formal
* You don’t need to write an essay — a few paragraphs is perfect
* A good intro post makes it way easier for the right people to find you.",2,1763501039.0,LAsocial,0,1.0,False

The chemistry was insane. We ended up hanging out for a few days straight and hooking up a lot. Basically, we didn’t get anything done those days.

He eventually said things were moving too fast. For context, I just got out of a relationship about a month ago (he knows that), and I can admit I’m kind of “relationship-y” by nature. He’s been single for a long time, so I think maybe the contrast scared him a little. He said I was sus bc of the order and timing of things.

After those few days, he told me he thought we should slow down and just be friends, like, grab a beer or coffee sometime. He basically dumped me but even our breakup was cute, we were kissing and everything. Although I was needy and showed him I’m sad. He also told me I should go back on the app, which honestly confused me even more.

I texted him for the beer next week, said yeah this is nice but he’s not sure about the day. He’s a bartender too. Texted him the next week if he was working bc I had some free time and he just said yes but texted me at 1 am saying he didn’t see me.

Then I asked him if he’s down to hang out AGAIN and said he can’t today I said me neither what’s the verdict? He’s like “I can’t this week, my friends staying over, we can see next week”.

The real issue is. I would literally befriend him. I genuinely don’t wanna pursue him but he’s being so fucking annoying

Point is: should I just ghost and forget about him? Or confront this? But I can’t lieeee I don’t wanna ghost!

Also I don’t know if this matters but he always replies quickly. Like he really be on his phone. So him completely ghosting me isn’t an issue. I boosted his ego by giving him “too much face”, complimenting his work and making him feel really good which is what’s natural for me. 

I literally faked it and he’s acting like he’s top shit 😂 I also did boost his ego because I’m also the kind of person who wants people to see what I see in them. So I would compliment his work all the time and made him feel really good

Let's talk today about something a lot of people ask for more information: ""What do I eat on the Candida diet"".  There is SO much confusion out there, and everybody has their take on the matter. Truth is - there is no ""perfect"" Candida diet. It's what works for you that's important.

After years in clinical practice, thousands of stool tests, and now two years of writing and refining my Candida and gut health books, I completely understand why people feel lost. There’s a lot of noise, diet myths, and BS out there, and most of it only adds to the confusion.

So today, I want to give you a clear, experience-based explanation of “how the Anti-Candida Diet actually works” — and I hope this post helps clarify my views and experiences in this field.

# Ultimate Candida Cleanse Books

And for those of you who’ve been asking: both of my Candida books — the Ultimate Candida Cleanse [Program Book](https://yeastrix.com/product/ultimate-candida-cleanse-program-pdf/) and the [Guide Book](https://yeastrix.com/product/ultimate-candida-cleanse-guide-pdf/) — are now finally available on Candida.com.

It took two years, I’ve re-written and refined all my previous Candida overgrowth and gut cleansing protocols. They are available as PDF downloads at only 10.00 each.

*Now, let’s get into it:*

# What an “Anti-Candida” Diet Really Is

The purpose of the Anti-Candida Diet is pretty simple:

**Reduce the yeast’s ready food supply, support and improve digestion and gut function, incorporate antimicrobial foods, strengthen the beneficial bacteria that keep everything in balance.**

We all know that Candida albicans and dysbiotic bacteria thrive when the diet is high in sugar, refined carbs, alcohol, and pro-inflammatory foods. Candida colonies and biofilms weaken when you use whole foods, antifungal herbs, spices and vegetables, anti-inflammatory meals, and steady gut microbiome support.

**This diet does not need to be extreme.** It’s not “yeast starvation”. It’s not “never eat fruit or gluten"" approach. I’ve found it to be a *structured, therapeutic approach* that helps reset a gut microbiome that’s gone off the rails due to any number of reasons.

For decades, most people with Candida overgrowth, IBS, or SIBO only had very basic supplements and a handful of early books to rely on. Thankfully, the landscape has changed dramatically over the past 40 years I’ve been involved with Candida and gut dysbiosis. We now have a far more sophisticated understanding of the gut ecosystem — and it’s largely due to huge advances in microbial DNA analysis.

We’ve got techniques like 16S rRNA sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and far more sensitive qPCR panels have completely transformed how we identify bacterial and fungal overgrowth. Instead of relying on guesswork or vague symptoms, we can now measure microbial signatures with remarkable accuracy. Modern stool testing no longer just looks at a few cultured bacteria — it reveals entire microbial communities, their diversity, metabolic pathways, and even their interactions.

These breakthroughs have confirmed what I have observed for decades:

**Candida overgrowth almost never exists on its own — it’s tied to gut bacterial imbalance, biofilm activity, immune dysfunction, lifestyle and dietary patterns.**

# Foods Are Medicines

The other point is that more recent has made it very clear that specific foods, herbs, and spices contain potent bioactive compounds — polyphenols, terpenes, sulphur compounds, allicin, eugenol, thymol, citral, and many others — that can directly inhibit fungal hyphae formation, weaken biofilms, suppress pathogenic bacteria, and enhance the growth of beneficial species.

So while my early anti-Candida approaches were based largely on clinical intuition, today I have both the clinical experience and most recent science to confirm what actually works. And that combination has allowed me to refine an anti-Candida overgrowth, IBS, and SIBO approach into a much more effective and evidence-supported protocol than what existed decades ago. Across more than 20 years of stool testing, I can tell you this with confidence:

**People with Candida overgrowth almost always have gut bacterial imbalance as well — SIBO, LIBO, SIFO, or a mix.** That’s why the ideal diet needs to address both fungal and bacterial issues, it’s rarely just a ""Candida overgrowth"" issue.

Let’s break down these recommendations down into a clear and practical framework of 7 principles:

# 7 Core Anti-Candida Diet Principles

**1. Always Remove Gut Irritants First**

This is your gut foundation we are talking about, you can't build it on poor food choices. If you can’t cut all the crap first - you’re not going to get very far with your foundation. Take out everything that yeast and dysbiotic bacteria thrives on, inflames your gut, or slows healing right down.

* Cut sugars, refined carbs, junk, take-away foods, ultra-processed foods, alcohol and soda drinks.
* Reduce coffee and tea (caffeine can irritate the gut for some).
* Avoid inflammatory foods: processed meat, deep-fried foods, artificial sweeteners, additives, and — for sensitive people — dairy and gluten.
* Swap these for calming, anti-inflammatory foods. (the Guide book)

**2. Support Digestion From the Start**

Weak digestion is one of the biggest overlooked drivers of Candida overgrowth and SIBO. Sugary and refined foods negatively affect your digestion.

* Use foods that stimulate stomach acid and enzymes — lemon water, apple cider vinegar, ginger, bitter herbs and vegetables.
* Consider digestive enzymes, they help many people. It’s common to have low pancreatic and stomach function.
* My simple [ACV digestive shot ](https://candida.com/apple-cider-vinegar-digestive-shot/)has helped many people restore upper-gut function.

When your digestion is strong, fermentation and dysbiosis drops significantly — and so does yeast and biofilm activity. Nutrient absorption improve - and so does every aspect of your health along with it. Also helpful: eating smaller, more frequent meals to reduce fermentation in the gut.

**3. Use Antimicrobial Foods Daily**

This is where the diet becomes powerful, we are starting to talk: “let food be your medicine”. Certain [herbs and spices contain natural antimicrobial compounds](https://candida.com/antimicrobial-foods/) that suppress harmful yeast, bacteria, and even some parasites.

* Garlic
* Cinnamon
* Cloves
* Oregano
* Coconut oil
* Ginger
* Lemongrass

These foods help reduce harmful microbes *without* wiping out the good ones.  
Antimicrobial supplements can be used, but food-based antimicrobials remain the backbone.

**4. Prioritise Nutrient-Dense Whole Foods**

Your body needs building blocks to repair the gut and support immunity. I've researched and written comprehensive blog posts about all of these food groups on [candida.com](http://candida.com)

* Fresh vegetables and fruits
* Nuts and seeds
* Whole grains
* Lean proteins
* Healthy fats and oils
* Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, kale, Brussels sprouts) for liver support
* Polyphenol-rich foods — berries, green tea, herbs, spices
* High-fibre, colourful foods feed beneficial bacteria and help restore microbial diversity.

**5. Heal and Soothe the Gut Lining**

A healthy gut lining prevents ""leakiness"" and keeps bacteria where they belong. remember that gut repair isn’t optional — it’s absolutely essential if you want to prevent any Candida overgrowth, IBS, or SIBO recurrences.

* Bone broth
* Gelatin
* Omega-3 rich foods (salmon, sardines, flaxseed)
* Turmeric
* Leafy greens
* Bright-coloured vegetables and berries

**6. Rebuild the Microbiome With Probiotic Foods**

Once the gut has calmed and the fungal and bacterial pathogen load drops, it's time to bring in probiotics and probiotic-rich foods and drinks. This stage helps prevent relapse and stabilises long-term gut health, although consuming these foods and drinks is fine throughout your Candida diet protocol. During the rebuild stage I recommend at least two different probiotic-rich foods.

• Sauerkraut  
• Kefir  
• Kimchi  
• Miso  
• Yogurt  
• Fermented vegetables

**7. Hydrate and Detoxify**

As fungal and bacterial microbes die-off, your body needs help flushing out the byproducts. This simple step can drastically reduce die-off symptoms.

* Drink plenty of filtered water
* Herbal teas are fine (non-caffeine)
* Hydration keeps digestion moving and supports detox pathways
* You'll think and feel better, and your gut will work better.

**Why This Diet Approach Works**

When you combine the seven principles above, you:

* Reduce fungal and bacterial overgrowth
* Reduce biofilm colonies
* Improve digestion
* Support liver and detox pathways
* Strengthen immunity
* Restore gut microbial balance
* Reduce bloating, fatigue, brain fog, and recurring infections

It’s a structured therapeutic approach that’s been refined with clinical experience and supported by research on gut dysbiosis, Candida behaviour, and our gut microbiome ecology.

I hope this gives you clearer understanding of *what to eat*, *why it matters*, and *how this diet helps people recover*.

Remember -if you decide to follow the program, both the **Ultimate Candida Cleanse Program** and **Guide Book** are now available on [Candida.com](http://Candida.com), and I’ll soon be supporting readers and participants on my [new YouTube channel ](https://www.youtube.com/user/EricBakkerND/)\- stay tuned.

Also, this is kind of a long story so, if you manage to get to the end, thanks a lot!

My girlfriend and I became officially a couple two weeks ago, but we started seeing each other since August this year. Im her second boyfriend and she’s my first girlfriend. We have known each other for 8 years, we met in musical band back in high school, she was my freshman and I was her senior, we both loved singing so we got along very well and would greet each other in the hallways every now and then but never really developed any strong bond or friendship. On July this year, we ran into each other at one of the gyms I usually go to after not hearing from her for 7 years, she recognized me, we chatted and hit it off very easy, since she’s in the insurance business she offered me a meeting to see if I was interested, I accepted and scheduled.

She texted me later that day and we started talking almost daily since that afternoon, the meeting came and I thought after it we would stop talking, but turned out she genuinely wanted to catch up with me so we kept on texting daily and sharing each other's days.

We spent two weeks like that until one day after a night out with my best friend (26M) she called me only because she wanted to talk, I accepted which surprised me since I had an awful hang over and normally I hate speaking with anyone when I’m feeling like that but I’m glad I accepted, we spent 3 hours straight talking and joking around and agreed on going out together soon.

A few days went by and I told her if she would like to hang out and work out with me, she accepted and we saw each other at the gym we met. Things started to change that day, we both noticed each others bodies, and started to feel attraction. She’s a pretty woman and has a natural curvy body, and me on the other hand, I’m not the most handsome guy ever but I’ve been working out and eating healthy for 2 years now, currently preparing for competing next year in Classic Men's Physique category and I leveled up my fashion sense and always try to look good.

We got closer after that day and eventually agreed to meet at a coffee for a date because we couldn’t speak much at the gym. The day arrived and we had an awesome and deep conversation, got to know each other better and shared what we were looking for in a partner. As I mentioned, I’ve been working myself for a long time, so I learned to instead of just talking and saying out loud whatever comes to mind, to listen and understand the other person whether it’s a friend or someone I’m interested, this because of therapy and some experiences I went through. I’m saying this because I noticed she started to open up a lot the more I listened and said I understand how she was feeling, even to the point that she mentioned I was the first person she had ever been with that actually thinks before speaking, which made me feel good but at the same time made me wonder what type of people she’s used to be surrounded by since she would ask “can I say something?” Even when I wasn’t speaking or things like “Does this bother you?” She started telling me about her relationship with her family and well, I noticed there was a lot of pain in her voice.

The rest of the date went great and we decided to go out again, but before that she asked what were we and I told her we were getting to know each other if she was okay with that, and again, she agreed. The same week, we went to have a work out together and after that we sat on a bench and kept on talking about life in general, at some point we started hugging each other and then I walked her back to her car since her father called and it was getting late.

Before she left, we started talking more about what we were looking for in our partner, and somehow the conversation changed to the sexual aspect of it. She told me her body count (4) and I told her I was a virgin since I never felt secure with the people that could have happened. She didn’t get into details but only told me about two of these people, one being her first boyfriend and the other one a guy who is older than us (38M) that she dated at the beginning of the year but she left him because he was very unstable and couldn’t “satisfy” her.

This information of course didn’t matter much to me, we weren’t even officially dating and I get she was trying to be honest and transparent, but, nowadays I kind of regret knowing that. Eventually, the more we started going out I realized she started to tell me a lot of her past, not only partners but in general about her life. 

I thanked her for trusting me and sharing all her secrets but, the more I started to feel affection for her, the more uncomfortable I was starting to feel, specially since I could “put a face” to some of her previous sexual partners. I tried my best to be unbothered, and being honest, I don’t mind anything about her ex boyfriend, somehow it was a very “childish” relationship because they were together since high school and broke up mid college.

We had our first time and things started to go really smooth for the both us, until last month, I already knew about three of these men, and again, I was unbothered because she told me about it when the relationship was still growing stronger, but at that point, I already had strong feelings for her and she felt the same too, we became very intimate and spent a lot of time together, also we had agreed on September to be exclusive, so nothing to worry about.

But again, last month on October, we were having a personal conversation about our relationship and what we wanted for our future together, and again somehow we went to the past. She confessed me about that fourth person which had been a month before we started texting, and it was a one time only. She told me she regretted it completely and she never like having hook ups because she cares about her social image and didn’t want to seem like some easy girl who would go around sleeping with whatever dude proposed it. Sadly, I reacted in a very emotional way and felt really uncomfortable, she felt bad and regretted telling me about it. Long story short, we discussed it and there was nothing to worry about, but for whatever reason the idea of her sleeping with someone casually bothered me a lot.

Time passed and I tried to forget that and act like nothing happened but this slowly started to grow inside me and distracted me, I found myself thinking about that almost every day and even waking up with a bitter feeling and not only that but, the older guy she was dating at the beginning of the year reached out to her trying to get her back, of course she rejected him and removed him from every way of contact he could have, but still, this only triggered more insecurities since I remembered the “he couldn’t satisfy me” part.

Even with that, I came to accept that the past is the past and it should bother us if we want to be together, but I always end up thinking about those two men that were in her life before me. The ones she was in a relationship with I didn’t care but these two still bug me.

We talked about it and we agreed to not discuss the past anymore. Days passed and on October 30 we formalized our relationship ship, but still, somehow this bitter feeling does not go away, to the point that sometimes before starting intimacy intrusive thoughts cross my mind.

She’s made it very clear that she’s not in contact with any of them, and that she has never felt so attracted to someone as she’s with me, since I have always procured treating her as a lady and give her the place she deserves as my girlfriend. I support her and she does the same with me, we enjoy each other’s company and I really love her, but this insecurities have started to bother me more than I would like to admit. I had some situationships in the past and almost had a one night stand once, of course I never told her about anything since I don’t know how that could make her feel.

Any advice on how to overcome this situation? I really love her, want to be with her, but I don’t want to feel this way, thinking about her on those situations, she is very loyal and whenever a guy tries to flirt with her or even starts to go over the limit she tells me so we can do something about it, but this feeling of insecurity because of those two men before always get the best of me.

Thanks for reading this if you managed to:) hope you can give some advice or tell me if you went through something similar. Besides that, I’m really happy with her, she’s an awesome girl and she has given me all of her.

TL;DR: Girlfriend told me about some of her past experiences and they keep on bothering me even when there’s zero contact with those guys. How can I stop feeling insecure or jealous?

1p0oaoj,https://i.redd.it/h1awtta4132g1.jpeg,"Pink Bourbon, Geisha Must… A Process That Actually Feels New","I go through a lot of the new experimental coffees, carbonics, nitrogen, koji ferments, all the usual stuff, mostly to see which ones are genuinely doing something new and which ones are just chasing noise. Most of them are fun for a cup and then forgettable.

The Hachi-Amane Pink Bourbon from Native feels like something different.

The underlying process isn’t just another “anaerobic” with a cute name. Diego Bermudez is using what he calls a Symbiotic Process, and it’s basically a biochemical interface between two different coffee varieties. A whole batch of Geisha is fermented with a controlled mix of yeast and enzymes until it becomes a concentrated aromatic medium. Then the Pink Bourbon, already washed and cleaned, is immersed in that Geisha fermentation liquid. The idea is that the Pink Bourbon absorbs the flavor precursors, acids, and microbial metabolites from the Geisha must. It’s not flavouring; it’s chemical and microbial transfer before drying.

That raises some real questions about what we’re drinking. How much of the final cup is Pink Bourbon, and how much is the Geisha acting as an aromatic donor? Does this still count as expressing the variety, or is it an engineered hybrid? And does that distinction even matter if the cup is good?

Because the cup is good. It’s incredibly precise: dark berries, hibiscus, lemonade, all sharply defined without the muddy, fermented haze you get with a lot of experimental lots. It tastes constructed, but in a deliberate way, not the usual uncontrolled funk.

Whether you think this kind of process is the future or a distraction is up to you. But as a piece of technical innovation, it’s one of the more serious and intentional things I’ve tried recently, and definitely not just another “anaerobic with a fancy name.”",8,1763500781.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

But I feel way too responsible for her well-being to leave her, due to her chronic disease/disability and her current situation that makes her very socially anxious. Now I met a wonderful woman, that I want to meet again. I don't know, how I can make everyone happy.



Hi all,

I am in a very unfortunate situation in my relationship and I don't know how I can make everyone happy, including me. Or at least, how I can make sure that this is not turning into a shit show.

So, currently my girlfriend \[F25\], lets call her A, is studying in a foreign country for a few years. She left in September and will be back in March. Shortly after she left, I started living completely on my own and I noticed, that I didn't miss her. And that I can not imagine moving together with her.

I started understanding some things I have been feeling for months already, and now I cannot see a future with her anymore. Some things that are really draining me emotionally are the following:

\- I feel completely invisible in this relationship. Whenever we see each other, she just talks for 2 hours, emotionally unloads every little thing on me, and doesn't let me even answer. When I try to get a word in, she is silent for a few seconds to let me speak, and then completely ignores what I said. She doesn't give me a chance to even talk about what stresses me or weighs me down. And afterward she is either too tired and goes to sleep or is completely distracted by her phone. I only feel like I am of interest, when she is feeling lonely

\- She commented on my body way too often, I started feeling incredibly insecure and do feel uncomfortable changing around her. She often said I should suck in my stomach/belly more. I am quite athletic, I normally wouldn't care, but over time it got under my skin

\- I think of myself as a very romantic person and made it clear that I want to marry someday, without specifying when. This prompted her to repeatedly emphasize that I shouldn't propose to her, which hurt me quite a bit

\- We haven't had sex for a few years due to her chronic disease. Her doctors gave her a prescription and explained to her what to do, to (hopefully) overcome the problem (with sex, not the chronic disease). I supported her for years and never considered this a reason to leave her. But at some point, it became clear to me, that she isn't even following the directions of her doctors. This makes me feel awful, like she doesn't even want to be intimate with me

\- Repeatedly saying how I need her way more than she needs me. After telling her about something emotional, she made fun of me for it a few months later. And some other things come on top. I don't want to go into the details too much.

I always talked myself into believing that this is all my fault, that I am having the wrong feelings, and that she doesn't mean it that way. Now, after living alone for a few weeks and being way more happy, I realized that maybe this relationship is beyond fixing.

However, I am afraid of ending things, because I know she needs me right now. Living abroad amplified her anxiety. In her first days abroad, we regularly called, and she always cried or was on the brink of crying. I don't want to leave her while she is so vulnerable and doesn't feel good. I also don't know when to breakup. She will come to me to live with me over Christmas, which is also a problem because the flights are already booked.

Today, I met another woman (lets call her E) for coffee. It was clearly planned as a date, and we hit it off immediately, talked for hours. I never expected this to happen, and never told her that I am in a relationship. I know that it was wrong to go on a ""date"" while already being in a relationship, but I just expected to have a nice chat over some coffee and get to know an interesting person.

I really want to meet her again. But if I tell her about the relationship, that will probably and bad. If I don't, it will also end bad. When and how do I break up with my girlfriend? Or is this relationship not lost after all?

I don't think she is a bad person. She is (or was) always very caring and putting effort into this relationship. She has to wrestle her own insecurities, too.",1,1763500761.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False

Gandalf (A604572)
Male, 3 years old, 57 lbs
Notes on Gandalf:
Gandalf tolerates gentle petting on the head, but he is very shut down in the shelter environment and shows limited social skills with people. It is difficult to predict what his decompression period will look like once outside the shelter. He is challenging to walk at this time, he will resist, yelp, and attempt to hide, leash walking is currently very uncomfortable for him.
Gandalf met senior dog Coffee and did well, they were able to sit in the grass together and relax.
He was also introduced to a more energetic female dog, River. He initially growled at her but then was able to coexist and allow some curious sniffing. There was a previous report of him going after a smaller dog in the field (which may have been influenced by many factors), so it is unclear how selective or unsure with other dogs he may be. Any future introductions should be slow and supervised.

Gandalf appeared to enjoy spending time in the yard (on leash), he tolerated people being present but does not show much enthusiasm or engagement. He did take treats gently from the handler. At this time, he should be considered under socialized and a flight risk. He would do best with an adopter experienced in reading dog body language and able to provide a slow, patient decompression period while helping him adjust to living in a home.
When returning to his kennel, Gandalf walked inside on his own to hide and allowed staff to remove his leash without issues.  

 Give gorgeous Gandalf a chance outside the shelter to show his true personality. With love, care, patience and gentleness he will surely blossom.",11,1763500698.0,National_Pet_Adoption,1,1.0,False

Every morning I run out of cigarettes.  I have a choice to put the patch on and dive into sobriety or drag my ass to the gas station and buy another pack.

The not knowing is what sucks the most.  Climate change in Ohio is not that bad yet.  I feel like we are in a cocoon.  Surrounded by unimaginable horrors.  But we maintain.  

I know I will get cancer.  I did it to myself.  I stress smoked my whole life.  Boredom smoked.  After meal after coffee after sex.  It was my smoke filled period at the end of Life's sentences.

- when I start steaming, I always get a lot of large bubbles at first. Is that to big expected?

- when I start pouring, the foam directly starts to change the color of the cup (e.g notes of white) before the art part. Is that because my milk is too foamy?

1p0ntyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/newproductsamazon/comments/1p0ntyc/why_choose_a_puzzle_board_over_a_basic_mat/,Why choose a puzzle board over a basic mat?,"Look, I've been doing jigsaw puzzles for years now, and I used to just work on them directly on my kitchen table or on one of those cheap foam mats. Big mistake. Let me tell you why getting a proper puzzle board changed everything for me.

**The Problem With Regular Puzzle Mats**

Those basic felt mats seem like a good idea at first. They're cheap, they roll up, and you think you're saving money. But here's what actually happens – your pieces slide around, the edges curl up after a few uses, and good luck trying to move your puzzle without everything shifting. I lost count of how many times I had to rebuild sections because the mat decided to bunch up.

**Why Puzzle Boards Are Actually Worth It**

A decent puzzle board gives you a solid, flat surface that doesn't mess around. The pieces stay where you put them. You can sort your pieces by color or edge pieces without them mixing back together every time someone walks by.

The real game-changer though? You can actually move your puzzle. Like, pick it up and take it to another room. Or put it away when family comes over for dinner. With a mat, you're basically committed to that spot until you finish.

I finally got myself a quality puzzle board from [this collection on Amazon](https://athomewave.com/puzzle-board), and honestly, I should have done it way sooner. My back doesn't hurt anymore because I can work at a comfortable height. No more hunching over the coffee table for hours.

**What Makes a Good Puzzle Board**

The best puzzle boards have a few key features. First, a smooth working surface that keeps pieces from sliding. Second, sorting trays or drawers so you're not making little piles everywhere. Third, some kind of cover system so your cat doesn't destroy three days of work while you're sleeping.

Some boards even tilt up so you can work at an angle, which is surprisingly nice when you're doing those 1000+ piece monsters. Your neck will thank you.

**My Honest Take**

If you only do puzzles once in a blue moon, sure, maybe stick with a basic mat. But if you're doing puzzles regularly – like more than a few times a year – just get a proper puzzle board. Your future self will appreciate not having to redo the same corner piece section for the third time.

The difference in your whole puzzling experience is pretty significant. You'll actually finish more puzzles because you're not frustrated with your setup. You can take breaks without worrying about the dog or kids messing things up.

If you want to check out some solid options that won't break the bank, [here's where I found mine](https://athomewave.com/puzzle-board). They've got different sizes depending on whether you usually do 500-piece puzzles or go for the massive 2000-piece challenges.

Bottom line – puzzle boards aren't just fancy accessories. They're actually useful tools that make the hobby way more enjoyable. Sometimes spending a bit more upfront saves you a ton of headaches down the road.",1,1763499740.0,newproductsamazon,0,1.0,False

I'm not seeing many results from Google ads,"I released my app [Loyvo](https://loyvo.azurewebsites.net/) a couple weeks ago, and I have spent around £400 on Google ads to try and start some users.

I ended up removing the ads for the iOS app since the conversion for this was way lower, and just showed the Android app ads.

However after all this I only have one business customer that uses the app consistently. I tried to target it towards coffee shop owners since its a loyalty card app but couldn't find specific categories in Google ads to best fit my niche.

Are there better ways of marketing that aren't going to cost so much per install? Are Facebook/Instagram ads worth investing in?

1p0nsmc,https://i.redd.it/mtd6hxnwx22g1.jpeg,The Flesh of Mr. Jackknife,"Beth pushes open the rusted metal doors of the warehouse and steps inside. Dark bruises cover her face and arms. She nervously hugs a dead flashlight to her chest. She walks down the corridor, stepping over shadowy shapes as she presses forward.

The door on the opposite end of the corridor flings open, allowing the dim fluorescent bulbs of the next room to provide light to the decrepit corridor. Beth notices the shapes she has been stepping over are bodies, brutalized and sliced into pieces. Another shape can be seen pushing itself through the doorway. At first it’s vaguely the shape of a man, but as it moves forward its silhouette betrays the guise of humanity. It’s soft and wet and undulates as it moves. Beth screams.

To a cameraman, it was a great shot. To some young theater goers, hiding their eyes in fear, it would be perfect. To Clark Harris, it would need a reshoot.

“CUT!”

I stopped the camera, and wiped the sweat from my brow. The heat in the warehouse was oppressive, and stepping out into the cool autumn air brought instant relief. I lit up a cigarette and watched the treeline surrounding the warehouse. I held the smoke in and allowed it to dance in my lungs.

I was deep in thought when the warehouse’s back door swung open, making me jump. I cleared my throat and shifted my weight back and forth anxiously. Michelle, with an air of attitude in her movements, sat on the steps just outside of the door. Her curly blonde hair was disheveled and covered with fake dirt and her skin was covered with cosmetic bruises and wounds. 

I turned around and tried to avoid acknowledging the awkward silence occurring between us. She was much younger than me. I couldn’t think of any common ground between us, no small talk ideas came to mind. 

A few moments passed and I turned around again to face her. Her blue eyes pierced into mine. She cradled her head in her hands and had a frustrated look on her face. Wordlessly, I pulled a smoke from the pack and held it out to her. She took it, and placed it in her mouth. She continued staring at me. I had never felt so intimidated by someone half my size. Then the realization hit me like a bag of bricks. 

“Shit, yeah… sorry,” I said, holding my lighter out to her, flame flickering in the autumn breeze.

***

“What do you think of that thing, man? Freaky, right?” Clark was beaming with energy, his eyes darting back and forth between me and the latex nightmare before me. “Here he is, our Mr. Jackknife,” he said excitedly, as if I might have missed it.

“Man, the detail is unreal. We should get some close ups,” I replied, my mind swimming with ideas. I would be lying if I said I fully understood Clark’s vision from the get go, but seeing our monster standing in front of us made this whole project feel more real.

It looked like a man wearing a long trench coat, standing a little over 7 feet tall. Long gangly arms hung at its sides, with rods connected to the wrists and elbows for the puppeteers to control them. Inside the trench coat was a glistening mass of fake flesh and slime. Gleaming blades of all different shapes and sizes protruded from all angles of the pile of gore. A fedora topped the head of the monstrosity, and a twisted, fleshy visage lay underneath it.

“Did a bang up job didn’t he?” Clark jabbed a thumb in the direction of a man who was hunched over mixing a bowl of slime with a paintbrush. He looked up from his work. I smiled and raised a hand in greeting.

“Nice to meet you. I assume you are Robert, I have heard a lot about you.” The man said. “I’m Steven, I have been working with puppetry and effects for many years. I have constructed a team of very talented individuals. Your project is in the right hands.”

“You can call me Rob if you’d like,” I replied. “I do the camera work. We filmed a short scene with your team last night, though I didn’t get to see him in the light.” I gestured towards Mr. Jackknife.

“He’s truly wonderful, isn’t he?” Steven mused. “My greatest creation yet.”

Once the puppet had been properly caked in slime, we could begin the filming. It was an outdoor scene, making the heat of the warehouse a distant memory. The scene would require Michelle to have a fight with Mr. Jackknife. It had all the makings of a fun shoot, and I was excited. We had choreographed the whole thing, and had practiced a bit with the puppet without the cameras rolling. Steven hadn’t lied, his team was immensely talented. The flesh under the monster’s coat seemed to ripple and breathe with each movement.

I began setting up the camera, dialing in the angle for the shot. I was peering through the viewfinder when a tap on my shoulder caused me to jump. It was Michelle, with a wide grin on her face, and an outstretched hand. She really had a knack for scaring me. When I realized what she was asking for, I started to laugh.

“You some kind of charity case now?” I asked, digging in my pocket for the box of smokes.

“C’mon, I need something to chill me out.” she replied, accepting the cigarette and lighter. “I’m probably gonna have to film this scene a hundred times.”

“Clark is a particular guy, I’m surprised he doesn’t come over here and get behind the camera,” I chuckled. “How did you end up on this project anyway?”

“I’m a barista at a coffee shop nearby. Clark came in and asked me if I wanted to get paid to be in a movie. I asked him if it was *that* kind of movie, and he said no.”

I thought about what a fool Clark was and laughed even harder. “No shit, and you said yes?”

“Mama always said I had a face for the pictures.” Michelle said with a shrug. I could barely believe what I was hearing. Michelle did great work, I thought for sure she was some actress Clark had found with a casting call. Before I could say anything else, she was bounding off to the set, and I went back to my camera.

The filming night dragged on, I listened to Clark shout out his revisions while the increasingly tired Michelle continued perfecting the scene. The puppeteers slid Mr. Jackknife across the floor, resetting him back to his starting position. I realized as I watched through the viewfinder that I had never spoken to either of them, even though they seemed to accompany Steven everywhere. They were constantly hooded and wearing all black, which made sense during filming, but not in between scenes.

I aimed the camera and zoomed in, attempting to spot the face of the puppeteer controlling Mr. Jackknife's arms. The camera slowly zoomed in and for a fleeting second I captured a motion blurred look at the puppeteer. He was extremely pale, his ghost white skin highly contrasting his black attire. He had sharp angular features, and had no visible eyebrows. I heard Clark yelling for the shoot to begin again, and I readied the camera.

Beth runs down a dark and damp alleyway before a brick wall blocks her path. She’s panting and begins to scramble for a way out. Behind her, a shape is closing in. It walks with slow and heavy footsteps and its body sways side to side. The shape stops in front of Beth, now illuminated by the lights nearby. Beth sees the face underneath the hulking monster’s hat and begins to panic. His hand pulls back a side of the trench coat and reveals a squirming mass of flesh and jagged blades. He reaches for the hilt of a knife that protrudes from his chest. With a sickening sound, the knife slowly exits the flesh, blood and bile eject from the now open hole. The knife, covered in viscera, rises above the creature’s head. Then the massive body of the beast collapses forward, crashing on top of Beth and onto the ground.

“CUT!” Clark says, flying out of his director's chair. “The fuck just happened?”

I shared in Clark’s confusion. That was not the way we had been rehearsing the scene for the past several hours. Beth was supposed to yank a blade of her own from Mr. Jackknife’s body, and start stabbing the puppet. Clark shoved the puppeteers out of the way and lifted the puppet from the ground. By this time I was already running over to them as well. When I finally reached the pair my heart sank.

Beth laid on the ground covered in fake blood and slime, but among the sea of bright red was a deep, darker crimson. Michelle had a large gash in her forehead, and blood poured down the left side of her face. 

“What the fuck man?!” I found myself shouting. “She’s hurt, man. We need to get her to a hospital now!” I tore off my overshirt and Clark used it to compress the wound. I looked around me and noticed Steven and his team were nowhere to be found. Marching off set, I spotted one of the puppeteers in his black clothing, standing still with his back towards me.

“Hey man, you need to tell me what just happened, that was not how that was supposed to go!” I couldn't hide my anger, and when I got no response, not even a turn in my direction, my anger bubbled over. 

“I’m talking to you, asshole!” I say, my palm landing hard on the puppeteer's shoulder and spinning him around. It was the pale man that I had spotted in the viewfinder. His eyes were unfocused, not looking in any particular direction. His mouth was partially open, like a cartoon character under hypnosis.

“Did he get the blood?” His words were slurred like a drunk man’s.

“What?”

“The blood, he smelled like flesh.”

The man’s eyes focused on mine while I stared at him in confusion. Then he walked past me, allowing his shoulder to collide with mine as he walked forward, almost robotically. Clark and Steven seemed to be in the middle of a frantic conversation, while the second puppeteer stood nearby.

“This was due to a mistake by my team, and I intend to make it right to the best of my ability,” Steven was saying as I approached. He helped the injured Michelle to her feet and they began to head to Steven’s station wagon. I felt strange about the situation, but if Michelle was getting medical attention then I figured it was for the best.

“Steven said he’s gonna take care of everything, Rob. He’s taking Michelle to the hospital. He said they used real blades in the puppet because it showed up better on camera, they never expected an accident like that to happen,” Clark explained, as if he was trying to convince himself more than me. 

I could feel my heart thumping in my ears, the adrenaline of the situation was wearing off and the panic was starting to set in. “Clark, man, this is all fucked! What if Michelle is really hurt, man? She's just some random girl you pulled off of the street.” My mind was spinning in circles. So many worst case scenarios were running through my head. What if we got sued? My mind selfishly wondered how Clark and I would deal with the repercussions of what had happened. Clark interrupted my manic pacing by grabbing my shoulders.

“Chill out Rob, chill!” He said, staring me in the eyes. I couldn’t return his gaze, my eyes were on my shoes. “Listen buddy, this has been our dream since school, remember? Nobody ever said it would be easy. This is what we always wanted man, think about it! Theatres full of scared kids watching our movie! Kids dressing up as Mr. Jackknife for Halloween! This is what we always wanted to do!” 

After a few minutes and some deep breaths I was more grounded than before. My mind went back to the strange way the puppeteer was acting. When I explained to Clark what happened, he said something that was even stranger.

“Yeah one of them was listening in on Steven and I when we were figuring out what to do with Michelle. Weird looking guy, super pale and totally hairless.”

How was that possible? The man that I had been talking to had the exact same appearance. Was I overthinking this? I had a massive pit in my stomach that I couldn’t ignore. 

Clark, unable to read the room, chose this time to tell me that we weren’t actually allowed to be filming in this alleyway. Apparently he hadn’t bothered to go through the proper channels to secure permission. We set to cleaning up the set and getting all of our equipment back in storage before deciding our next move. In the frantic mess that was the night's events I had failed to notice that Mr. Jackknife was nowhere to be found.

“Hey Clark, did Steven take the puppet with him?”

“I don’t know why he would, can you not find it?”

As Clark walked over I noticed the slimy, muddy footprints leading out of the alleyway out into the street. Logically it must have been from a crew member that had stepped in some slime while working on set. But why were the shoe prints so large?

Before we knew it, we were driving. We abandoned all of the film equipment and left. Something had felt wrong to both of us, and we decided that if there was a chance we could help, we should try. I looked out the window solemnly. Clark was right, it had always been a dream of ours to make a movie together. But the budget had grown out of control, the endless reshoots, and now our lead actress was hurt. With every passing moment the dream felt just a little bit further away. 

A few minutes passed and my thoughts were interrupted by the sounds of squealing tires as we lurched to a stop. A massive object slammed into the windshield and fell to the ground in front of the car. I couldn’t believe my eyes, Mr. Jackknife was laying face down in a heap in the middle of the road. Blood and slime was splattered everywhere.

We sat in silence, failing to understand what was happening. The car’s windshield was cracked and a side mirror dangled from its wires.  Mr. Jackknife slowly stood up, using his awkwardly long arms to pull himself up the road’s guard rail. He began walking again, his legs buckling and shaking like a newborn deer. Without so much as turning around, he continued walking the way he was heading. 

Our pursuit of the puppet was slow going, the car crawling behind him as he took each shaky step forward. Eventually, Mr. Jackknife took a hard turn off of the road, down a long gravel driveway, and towards a large industrial building. It looked like it was long abandoned, with overgrown vegetation and boards across the windows. 

Clark stopped the car and turned the headlights off. We waited under the cover of darkness to see what would happen. As the puppet approached the door, several puppeteers burst out and began to drag Mr. Jackknife through the threshold. 

There were at least ten of them. They all looked identical to the two that worked on our set. They worked quickly, piloting Mr. Jackknife through the door and out of sight.

“Shit, they probably have Michelle in there, should we find a phone and call someone?” Clark didn’t take his eyes off of the door as he spoke. Glancing up at the rearview mirror, he froze. 

Looking behind me, there were several puppeteers hiding in the woods behind us, their eyes glowing like a cat's in the moonlight. We had slowly crawled up the driveway and hadn’t realized how far we had come. Suddenly a shadow appeared next to the driver’s side window. A puppeteer had silently moved right next to us, and I watched as the other pairs of eyes in the distance drew closer. 

The puppeteer by the window wound up a punch and swung wildly at the window. As soon as its fist made contact, it exploded into a shower of blood. It appeared to have no bones, just skin, flesh and blood. I whipped around as another slammed its head into my window, causing it to crack. When it pulled its head from the window it had a gaping crater where the top half of its face used to be.

Soon, dozens of them had set upon the car. The roof was filled with dents as blood poured down the windows from above. They kicked the windows until their feet fell off and they were kicking with nothing but stumps. It didn’t take long for them to break the windows and reach in. The broken glass shredded their limbs into ribbons, but they didn’t stop grabbing. I kicked the car door open hard, caving in the chest of a puppeteer. I tried to make a run for it but was tackled to the ground. One of the horrible clones started to beat me, its fingers breaking off against my chest. I reached out in self defense and its face pulled off in one swift motion. I was able to escape the now eyeless creature as it felt around blindly in the grass.

As I ran I turned back to see the car completely covered in viscera and thrashing bodies. Clark was still inside somewhere. If I turned back now, I would be overrun by the puppeteers and killed. They were fragile enough to deal with alone, but if I was overrun by multiple of them I would have no chance of survival. I reached the door Mr. Jackknife had gone through and tugged at the handle. It was locked. My attempts to be quiet were foiled by crunching leaves as I circled the building's perimeter.

I reached a window and began tugging at the boards covering it. The first board released, clattering to the ground. I quickly checked behind myself to find the puppeteers were still busy with the car. The next board came loose. I turned around again. This time all of the puppeteers stood completely still, their broken bodies still dripping with blood. I heard footsteps behind me as I pulled the last board off with a tug and leapt through the window frame.

The room inside descended much further underground than I anticipated, and I tumbled down and crashed through a large cot. Pain shot through my shoulder as I stood up. The now broken cot looked like one from a hospital. As I squinted in the darkness I noticed several other identical beds scattered around the room. I slowly crept through the room, noticing that there were several unmoving puppeteers laid in some of the beds. Some of them were connected to IV drips that were filled with blood. Some of them moved their limbs or thrashed their heads back and forth. Others simply followed me with their eyes as I passed by. 

The door at the end of the room I was heading to swung open, causing me to take cover underneath a cot. In the darkness I recognized Steven. He was wearing a blood stained white coat over his button up and khaki pants. He started inspecting the cot that I had broken and noticed that the window above was no longer boarded. A flashlight clicked on and he began to search the room, the light stopping to inspect each bed. As I watched, I tried to decide my course of action. I could try to disable Steven, but if the puppets woke up I would be overrun. I resolved to try to find Michelle before anything found me. I pressed forward, hoping to make it to the door before I was discovered. I moved through the room on my stomach, trying my best to stifle the sounds of pain I wanted to make due to my aching shoulder. As I reached for the door handle, I was suddenly illuminated by the beam of the flashlight.

“Stop it, Robert. You’ve seen enough of this closet’s skeletons, I fear.” Steven made his way toward me as I sat paralyzed in fear. “You won’t make it out there. They are well trained to deal with outsiders.”

“Steven, I-I don’t understand man. Listen, I just want to take Michelle and Clark and go home, I don’t understand any of this.” 

Steven stared at me with an expression of pure apathy. “I wouldn’t expect you to understand, Robert, but you should have never come here. The affairs that take place under this roof are not only private, but sacred.” 

“The puppet, he was walking down the street.” I was desperate to understand. It all felt unreal, like I was trapped in a waking nightmare.

“I felt terrible having him make the journey on his own, but the situation called for it. I never intended for you to find out about this place. When Mr. Jackknife got a taste for blood, it forced my hand to action.”

The door slammed open, and pushing through it was a giant mass of body parts. It looked like several of the puppeteers had all been melted together. It drug itself forward with its many arms and legs, and its heads all frantically looked in different directions. 

“Gently now, take him to a donation chair, please.” Following orders, the hulking beast wrapped me in a bundle of squirming arms. They felt incredibly smooth and soft, like the skin of a newborn. I found myself unable to struggle as I was dragged through the doors and out of the room. As we passed through the corridor, I saw rows and rows of giant human shaped molds. Some were empty, and others were closed, with latex dripping from the cracks in between the two halves.

In the next room, there were lines of chairs with shackles for the hands and feet. I began to struggle harder, and as I thrashed and tore at the monster's body it began to leak blood and let out groans of misery. I was thrown into a chair, and the monsters' many hands made light work of my bindings. It then turned around, and exited from where it came. 

I waited several minutes in the chair, my hands quivering in pure terror as I imagined what would happen next. Sweat rolled down my forehead, stinging my eyes with no hands to wipe them. Then the doors opened again. I shouted in pure terror, an animalistic guttural scream of pure agony. 

Crossing the threshold was Mr. Jackknife himself. He was being guided by two puppeteers, like an old lady being helped across the street. They released his arms and he began to lumber towards me with shaking footsteps.

The puppet had looked impressively realistic before, but this was different. Mr. Jackknife’s beady eyes rolled around in different directions in the flesh mound underneath his hat. Saliva bubbled in the small slit where a mouth should be. The shivering mass under the trenchcoat dripped with mucus and pulsated with an irregular heartbeat. In a few unsteady strides, he was right in front of me. He smelled like spoiled meat. I wretched and closed my eyes. I could feel his hot breath against my face as he took shallow, wheezing breaths. I listened with my eyes still shut tightly as he dislodged a blade from his body. He groaned in pain and the blade escaped with a sickening pop. 

My eyes shot open as the blade was drug down my forearm to my wrist. Blood began to pour out as I tried desperately to stay conscious. Mr. Jackknife lowered his massive head to my arm and began to feed. I flailed and panicked in a desperate attempt to escape, but the shackles restricted my every movement. 

The puppet’s feeding was interrupted by a push that caused him to topple to the ground. Michelle leapt onto the creature and began pulling a blade from his body. She twisted and shook the blade until blood ran down her palms and it came loose. She was like an animal, viciously stabbing Mr. Jackknife over and over again. She moved from his body to his head, putting out an eye with her frantic stabbing. Mr. Jackknife swung an arm and knocked Michelle off of him. He had bloody tears running down his face. He crawled through the metal doors where he had come from and disappeared down the hall.

She looked incredibly pale and her wound was still open and bleeding. I began to cry from pure relief as she undid my restraints. She smiled weakly and handed me my blood covered overshirt, gesturing to my gushing arm.

“You look like you need it just as much as me.” I pointed to her wounded head. 

“I’m alright, let’s get to a hospital,” Michelle responded, her smile failing to conceal her pain.

“We need to get Clark, he’s out in the car… I hope.”

We made our way back through the corridor. All of the puppets stood completely still, unmoving and waiting for orders. Laying just a few steps past the doorway was Mr. Jackknife collapsed in a pool of blood. Steven kneeled over him, his hand clutching a bleeding wound on his stomach. Tears rolled down his cheeks. His face was pale and his eyes fluttered, as if calling him closer and closer towards eternal sleep. 

“It’s a shame really, how all of this turned out. I wish I wouldn’t have had to cause so much pain.” Steven was speaking to nobody in particular, caressing the head of the deceased. A coughing fit ensued that sounded like it was dragging Steven closer and closer to hell. 

“He stabbed you, didn’t he?” I asked, anger in my voice. “Bet you never wanted any of these monsters feeding on *your* blood?”

“He hugged me, Robert,” Steven said, choking back another onslaught of tears. “He chose me over himself. Isn’t that beautiful? It’s a wonderful feeling, to be loved. He never knew he was anything but a normal man.”

I started towards the exit, with Michelle right behind me. After the door closed, the sound of sobs echoed from the inside. I walked toward the car, my head spinning. The car sat lonely at the end of the gravel drive now, covered in blood and dented beyond conceivable repair. I opened the driver's side door and confronted the truth. Clark was dead. We had promised to make a film together, and that promise had killed him. The spoils of all of our efforts reduced to blood and flesh. 

I moved him from the driver’s seat, and laid him down in the back. I left my dream back there with him. I could make a film someday, but I could never make a film with him. Before I knew it I had begun to sob. The world turned into smears of light in my eyes. Michelle was turned away, looking out the window. In her reflection, I saw tears running down her cheeks.

The car started with a groan. Both of the headlights had been destroyed, and I made my way down the drive in the pitch blackness. The drive gave way to the freedom of the road, and we plunged into the darkness together.

1p0nrwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Friendzone/comments/1p0nrwq/are_we_even_friends/,Are we even Friends????,"So I (26F) met this guy (26) on a dating app, and we immediately hit it off. The chemistry was insane. We ended up hanging out for a few days straight and hooking up a lot. Basically, we didn’t get anything done those days.

He eventually said things were moving too fast. For context, I just got out of a relationship about a month ago (he knows that), and I can admit I’m kind of “relationship-y” by nature. He’s been single for a long time, so I think maybe the contrast scared him a little. He said I was sus bc of the order and timing of things. 

After those few days, he told me he thought we should slow down and just be friends, like, grab a beer or coffee sometime. He basically dumped me but even our breakup was cute, we were kissing and everything. Although I was needy and showed him I’m sad. He also told me I should go back on the app, which honestly confused me even more.

I texted him for the beer next week, said yeah this is nice but he’s not sure about the day. He’s a bartender too. Texted him the next week if he was working bc I had some free time and he just said yes but texted me at 1 am saying he didn’t see me. 

Then I asked him if he’s down to hang out AGAIN and said he can’t today I said me neither what’s the verdict? He’s like “I can’t this week, my friends staying over, we can see next week”. 

The real issue is. I would literally befriend him. I genuinely don’t wanna pursue him but he’s being so fucking annoying 

Point is: should I just ghost and forget about him? Or confront this? But I can’t lieeee I don’t wanna ghost!

Also I don’t know if this matters but he always replies quickly. Like he really be on his phone. So him completely ghosting me isn’t an issue it’s just that I really wanna fucking humble this man. 

I literally faked it and he’s acting like he’s top shit 😂

IS THIS SALVAGEABLE?

I’ve been talking to him for two years. Our connection has been on and off, not because of him but because of me. At first I didn’t feel a spark and ended things, but we kept talking here and there. I still don’t feel a huge amount of chemistry, but I want to give him a real chance.

I wrote him off after our first meeting without really getting to know him, but he’s been persistent, genuinely serious, and overall a really nice person, so I want to see where this goes.

When we first met, I didn’t give him a hug. I had recently experienced abuse and wasn’t comfortable with physical contact, though I didn’t tell him that at the time. He was fine with it, and honestly, because of our cultural background, minimal physical contact is pretty normal anyway. The most I’d ever do is a quick fist bump to say hi and bye. Over the past two years we’ve met for casual coffees here and there, but nothing more.

Next week we’re finally going on a proper date after two years, fancy dress, heels, the whole deal ! and I’m so nervous. What if he tries to kiss me? I really don’t know how I’d react.

I have been on plenty of dates since but this specific date is making me very nervous.

	I know that this is going to sound insane, and not only will it make you fellas more angry but you will probably kill me on the spot if yous ever see me again. Now, I know our working relationship has been rocky lets say. But I have never been anything but a stand up associate, All those times things got fucked up wasnt on me and you know it.

	You know that it was just little Pat being a snake fuck when I lost all that money from the horse track, I had the envelope in my hand on the way to your fucking doorstep when he called me just kept insisting me took some off the top! Or the community center construction gig, how was I supposed to know that city was gonna be sniffing around all that huh? Never once did I do nothing without thinking about how it would effect things. But no I just gotta sit back and be accused of skimming off the top and being a cheat, I gotta just listen to these assholes subtly imply I'm turning rat. Its a fucking joke and you all know it. 

	Anyway as to the reason Im writing this thing, I just want a sort of insurance policy if you will, because I know the walls are closing in, I can see the writing on em while they shift towards me. I know you think Im a fucking idiot but I can still read. 

	But something happened to me a few days ago, and I think something else is gonna happen tonight. And I know you're gonna say I'm bullshitting or lying or whatever and to be honest I could give a shit. But I don't want you assuming I flipped or going after the people I love, leave em alone. This has nothing to do with them. Just everything to do with me, and if the uh people involved in this thing aren't taking me for a trip, this has a little something to do with you all too. 

	But the other night, 3, 4 in the morning, I felt compelled to walk outside. It wasn't a thing I thought to do, it wasn't sleep walking or nothing. I just did it, it was a fact that I had to. So I'm sitting in my backyard in my boxers looking like an asshole, just waiting, waiting and waiting for something. Then I start shaking, or not shaking more a vibrate I guess, and I can't move, not like I'm stuck there but I don't want to. It feels kinda nice to be honest, like some warm blanket or some shit, all a sudden the vibrate turns into this whole buzzing shit all around my body, its all I know in the moment, lights start flashing everything just sounds like when you hear a plane flying real low when you can't sleep at night, but like 50 planes flyin 2 feet off the ground. Then its nothing, nothing at all. 

	Im not in my backyard no more, and im not even sure if Im ritchie or whoever the fuck, I dont even know if *I am.* 

	Just like that my eyes open and I'm suspended in this big black room, or i dont know if it was a room, it was just black. Y’know like the room that asshole charlie rose sits in, but I don't got him across from me or a wood table or nothing. Thats all thats there is, nothing. I don't even remember if I could see my body much less feel it. I know it sounds crazy but it was like before  I was born. And I dont remember freaking out or being scared or nothing, it was just happening and I was there, no other buts or ands about it.  Im not bullshitting. 

	That buzz comes back, subtle at first and stays for awhile, it feels nice, until it slowly turns into this shock, just once every few seconds but it feels like being thrown from your bed down a flight of stairs. But then the buzzing comes back. Then shock the buzz, the whole time I'm not panicking for some reason, it's just happening. But the buzz is slowly but surely being replaced with the shock until the shock is all thats there, all a sudden the shock is my body. Everything feels spiky and electric, while this is all going on I feel myself coming back a bit, like I got this awareness all a sudden. But im still not panicking just aware that Im a person and that I'm me. Everything's still black still nothing. But the big shocks start giving way to even bigger shocks and with each of those shocks comes some kinda memory but Im in third person. These memories feel like they're on a projector but they're in my mind, its like when the shocks hit the memories fill the nothing like a screen in the inside of a dome. And i know these memories are real and theyre me but theyre not right. Theyre happening and im watching them but the views going all around they keep playing back, changing perspectives, I'm watching this shit from other people's eyes its crazy shit, I swear Im not bullshitting. 

	These memories keep getting pulled up, new ones then old ones then the same ones I just watched, being paused and rewinded like some kinda fucked up DVR box. All a sudden I see us, you know when I was doing work for you fellas, that one job I went on. 

I saw Pauly and me and Smalls in the car on the way to the place, I saw Smalls spill his coffee on his white shirt and Paulys car and Pauly flip the fuck out on him.



 I heard the radio broadcast from that morning, pitch perfectly. Phillies winning 4-3 in a third extra inning the night before, Benny Frank bridge being closed down cause some asshole in a red corolla decided to run into the median, its like im listening to it again. 



I see us pull up to that old falling apart warehouse, I see Pauly knock that little irish managing the property and yelling about something. Things skip around a bit 



Then im carrying some crate and loading it into the car, I know I saw what happened before that 

And I know that it got replayed multiple times 

But it was blurred



Pauly knocked around that little guy, we follow some other guy to the back, we grab some crate but things start getting a lil foggy, and I feel like I see the full memory once but its gone, like it was just snipped out. Now im just watching the drive and us getting there then us loading the crate into the car and driving away.

 The part between is still there but its like there's brackets, it's blurred and muffled on repeat. 

Not like im mis remembering or cant remember 

Its just blurred like a tv censor 

And it gets replayed over and over

I think I remember hearing Smalls say we were bringing the crate to hide it at some address downtown cause it kept being repeated but it was just muffled enough that I cant hear it. Then its all gone, all the memories, all that shits gone and I'm just there in the black again, still not freaking out for some reason. 

So im sitting there, just my perception its just floating in that black space. But its not a black space anymore, and I don't know when it changed it just did. But its not a black space anymore. Now its a silver, or white, or purple? I couldn't tell you but its still a single cover space that now seems to have defined edges like a big cube room, but not completely defined, still smooth. but now theres like structures and shit. I didn't know what they were but I understood that they were machines. I think I remember tall skinny black beams stretching from the floor to the ceiling, little orbs of  black light keep flashin and disappearin with this little buzz sound, shapes and geometry that are fluid with these walls and ceilings protruding and going back in. Everything around me feels like some kinda stretchy material but I understand its also a structured metal. But im still just there, I dont know where it is but I know Im there and thats just how it is, these descriptions of these things coming into my mind in sentences I never say using words I never use. 

	A circular shape appears on the wall followed by a smaller 3d circle growing and disappearing inside of it. Then theres jus this figure where that circle was, standing in front of the wall. But again, Im 

not worried, he… its just there. Its got skin like the T 1000 but its just deep metallic material that morphs and flows between warm colors. This things shape and form seems to change and shift every second, it speaks to me but doesn't open its mouth, and I respond but don't open mine 

It said something like 

“You and your friends took something from us, we’re gonna get it back. Go home make your disappearance explainable. You will be back tonight 

Or some shit, that was the gist of it at least, it was less that I heard it and more that I felt it. 

Then that was it 

Before I knew it I was standing in my backyard, looking at the fence in my underwear, everything was normal and quiet. I went back in the house, stove clock said 3:02. I didn't feel anything, nothing just was compelled to get back in bed and go to sleep like nothin happened. 

So here I am now, writing this. Its been about ten hours and its all been hitting me today. Got my blinds closed and my doors locked, writing this thing with a gun on the desk like thats gonna do anything. Doesnt fuckin matter what I do to prepare, those assholes are coming back, and I know it. So im gonna unlock my doors, kiss the wife and leave a message for the other one. Gonna come by and leave this note at the pork store, then Im gonna take my car over to long island, throw my shoes in the water and wait a little bit. 



Who knows if this notes gonna be there for anyone to see it in the morning but like I said, its insurance. And I know if anyone even sees this you’re gonna call it bullshit, call me a rat or think I really did steal all that money and run away to lay low. Honestly I wouldn't blame yous for thinking like that. And I know nothing I write is gonna change that. That being said, the only reason I am telling yous all this is because Im gonna disappear and its a very convenient time y’know. And I know how you fucking animals operate, I got friends and people I love and I dont need a couple guys in sweat suits making implications at em cause of some shit I did or didnt do. 



But honestly it doesnt matter, cause the guys I mentioned by name were mentioned  by name up there. And those guys… you guys are gonna call this whole thing just another one of Richie’s tall tales to get away from closing walls. But yous fellas, yous never seen walls close like they're about to. No you have not, this ain't a threat either. This is just how it is apparently. So it dont really matter all to much if you believe me, cause you’ll be seeing it for yourselves soon enough unless you can figure out a way to get that crate back to those guys. 



So good luck and nice knowing ya’s 

Richie.

I lost my younger brother in a motorbike accident just over 2 weeks ago, on Halloween. 
Processing and navigating this loss has been soul wrenching and exhausting and I’ve started to do a little bit of writing to get things out of my head. 
There is no comfort, but speaking with, or hearing from people who have gone through this is about the only thing that has helped slightly. I wrote this last night, just wanted to share, in case it speaks to anyone. 

Anyway, not after anything, just wanted to put it out and hopefully it helps someone navigating grief feel a little more seen. 

———————————————————

I’m going okay; 
I smile and I utter
 My insides are just caving in.
“Life keeps on moving, and we along with it”
A paused perpetual Halloween. 

A peg onto fabric, 
my billowy linens
A bright flash of terror, fresh rain, starless night. 
The breeze on my face, 
the sun hits my eyelids. 
Your blood draining out, seeps flooding my mind. 

The cupboards all taunt me
would Thanatos fit there?
I fill up the water, blow up a balloon. 
Sysyphus laughing, his long-lived short victory 
A trick and a punishment, 
I’d take any boon. 

Oh there is your laughter, but I do not want it. 
The kids scream out “MUUM”. 
I better go in.
I fold up the jumpers, just perfectly even.
Oh God how I’ll miss you. 
Your wide cheeky grin. 

You’re leaping from rooftops, 
bells jingling at Christmas.
You’re laying so still on that hard concrete road.
We play some new board games, and bake some more biscuits 
An Orpheus size scream gets caught in my throat. 

I wipe his cute face, 
all bright full of wonder 
You little hand poking through cracked toilet doors
A funny old joke, 
a laugh that escapes me 
My chest cracked wide open. 
Our mum on the floor. 

Sandal wings soaring up high in the sky
Did light-footed Hermes deliver you there?
Did he make you laugh? Were you scared, sorry, sad?
He reminds me of you in the books that I’ve read. 

Your kids are so funny, 
they both look just like you
A thought shoved right back in my pocket. 
At least it was instant, I think for a second.
This beast remains tame if I rock it. 

Lazarus dreaming, you haunt every waking 
Dandelion floating, ladybugs, storms. 
But I want to bury my head in a deep hole, 
Scream my throat raw and watch torture grow.  

Fridays are take out. 
The rain on their windscreen 
“He’s not gonna make it”. The scream down the phone
This life full of growing and joy and confusion 
And sadness 
and gore and crushed bones. 

Eternally mournful, I smile through motions. 
Atlas load crushing. 
Your face and that bike. 
Harry and Hagrid and trains off to Hogwarts. 
That ring on your finger, 
the bird in full flight. 

We are still moving, heads bobbing through oceans
A jolt like a festering wound 
School runs and errands, we sing out car windows 
Your laugh how it taunts me, you dumb drunken fool. 

The world keeps on spinning, the days turn to night times. 
Perseus sliced Medusa’s head. 
The roar of the sisters, the whole damn world quaking 
The hero, the snakes and your head. 

Mum is sad-gardening and everyone’s working, 
A whimper is hiding somewhere.
I sit and I smoke, 
one after another
A coffee gone cold in my hand.

As Clotho to Pelops, 
a new ivory shoulder.
Lachesis did not measure up. 
A violent swift snipping, 
a thread, and some scissors,
Atropos, inevitably, can go and get fucked. 

Christmas looms brightly, all shimmers and stars 
You hated your eyebrows. 
I loved that tattoo.
Presents sit wrapped up all neat in a pile.
I cannot bear it, 
these vision of you. 

The sun is so blinding, the grapes growing wildly.
your looming shade blocks out all light.
Dionysus blessed harvest, sour wine and some whisky 
Limbs tearing, that stain and your eyes.

The blanket is heavy, the white noise is deafening,
I’m worn and I’m weary 
straight down to the bone.
I’m wired, and twitching, a caged beast awakening. 
I pace this whole house. 
You’ll never come home. 

Achilles is roaring, Patroclus fallen 
a howling as deep as the night. 
We’re treading on blindly, this darkness is ravenous 
Id drink the whole Lethe dust dry. 

You slide into spaces, just out of my vision 
I wave at my neighbours brand new shiny car. 
Might try a new crossword, take up a new hobby
How fast were you going to end up so far?

The five of us huddle, “six then now and always”
Our universe now lit up in flames. 
Your reckless abandon, your face laughing wildly
Your life frozen still in that frame.

A moment suspended, sky bound and ablaze
Icarus meeting the sea. 
I set my eyes skyward, I never can see you
I pack away lunches and chop down a tree.

1p0nkr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkNarrations/comments/1p0nkr8/aita_for_ending_things_with_my_former_law_school/,"AITA for ending things with my former law school mentor after months of inappropriate behavior, ableist comments, boundary violations, and bizarre reactions?","I feel like I am going crazy and need outside input. I (24F) am a second-year law student. When I started law school my first year, I joined an LGBTQIA+ student organization that had just created a mentorship program. I signed up because I was overwhelmed and struggling academically and really needed guidance. I ended up being paired with the club’s then vice president (fake name: Alice (24F)).

Before I even met her, multiple people warned me she was a gossip, messy, and talked poorly about anyone she felt did her dirty. That made me nervous, so I didn’t respond quickly to her initial messages. She took all her other mentees out for coffee, but for me, she asked me to dinner at the only nice restaurant in town for drinks, dinner, and dessert. Prior to going to dinner I had heard some gossip about how she was interested in me and she was also liking my Instagram posts from years back on multiple occasions late at night. When I got to the dinner she very quickly crossed many boundaries and made it blatantly obvious that she was interested in one thing and one thing only. She leaned across the table and asked about my sexual orientation and even asked if I’d ever slept with an Indian woman. I tried to laugh it off and just pretend that we were just being friendly girls because I was new, drowning in school, and didn’t know how to shut it down. She continued making sexual and obvious remarks for the whole several hours we were together at the restaurant. During dinner she kept saying she wanted to ask me “something big” but it was “too soon” and kept bringing it up and hemming and hawing obviously wanting me to be very interested in what she had to ask me. I was terrified she’d ask to sleep with me or be FWB, so I told her she could ask another time. The literal next day another student who I was friendly with told me she had already been telling people she wanted to be FWB with me. I was mortified - this is law school, these are future colleagues, and I am very intentional about not being involved in any drama or anything that could be viewed as unprofessional.

 A friend’s partner, who had been FWB with her, warned me repeatedly that she never picks up on social cues, would talk badly about me if she felt like she had been wronged (which apparently happens a lot), and wouldn’t leave me alone because she could not take a hint. He asked me if I needed help with addressing some of the things he was seeing going on (I personally told him nothing about this situation). She continued to like my Instagram posts late at night. At a mentor/mentee event she hosted, she told me afterward that she and her friends created the whole event “just so she could see me.” When I left the event early because I did not want to be there, she insisted on walking me out, got into my car and immediately started asking me what my kinks were (again I just played dumb like I didn’t know she was interested and this was just a girly convo). I was dating someone I genuinely liked at the time, so this was extremely uncomfortable.

Later she admitted she made a Full blown PowerPoint of our texts and my photos (?) and showed it to her over 30-year-old friends so they could decide if I liked her back. This honestly was so embarrassing to me – again this is law school. I even met with another mentor and asked whether mentors were allowed to date their mentees because I was planning on reporting her due to how uncomfortable I was, but since the program was brand new, there were no rules yet. The mentor immediately told Alice I asked this question and Alice took it as a sign that I was interested in her.

Despite all of this, during finals I was desperate for academic support and reached out for outlines. I brought her coffee because I felt like if she thought I liked her she’d would actually do her job and mentor me which she honestly should have been doing in the first place.

Months later, after I broke things off with the guy I was dating, she and I began spending more time together. I thought maybe I actually liked her, she was always very understanding of my busy schedule and just being overwhelmed all the time at school. She told me she had feelings for me. I told her I was developing a crush, but I move very slowly, I put school/family/friends first, and I had previously avoided her because of the concerning things people told me about her.

For more context: I’m disabled from a past car accident (you cannot see it unless I remove clothing) and I’ll likely need a foot amputation later in life. I did bring this up a couple months into knowing her when I thought it was appropriate (I personally do not share this with anyone I am not close with as it is personal and private). Weeks later she started randomly talking about Bethany Hamilton (the well-known amputee surfer) and mocking her brutally and making fun of certain events that the movie was showing how this amputee was adapting to normal life in a disabled body. There was a specific scene in the movie where Bethany is attempting to make breakfast for her family and Alice thought it was hilarious how “stupid and ridiculous” she looked trying to cut up an orange with only one hand and she had to hold it between her feet. She dragged this on for at least five straight minutes while I just sat there obviously uncomfortable while Alice is just laughing at this poor girl. After she was done making her jokes, she said her and her brother thought the movie was hilarious because they have dark humor. It wasn’t dark humor; it was blatant ableism. Additionally she had just learned that I will require an amputation in the future to continue to walk in my adult life.

I told her this made me uncomfortable. She apologized but kept doing similar things. I limp without shoes because of my disability, and she repeatedly pointed out my limp or asked why I was walking like that or why I was hopping around and telling me I looked dumb. She once pushed me on the stairs trying to be “playful,” and even when I had to stop her and say “Hey be careful I am disabled and I fall all the time easily” she continued to push me “playfully”. It was so disturbing and upsetting to me to continually have to remind the person who is supposed to be my partner that I was disabled or a cripple and I personally do not want to have to bring that up all the time.

Whenever I came to her place, I brought slippers because walking without supportive shoes is extremely painful and hard for me to get around. She watched me limp around and never once offered a pair, even when she had extras. One day I hesitated to go inside because I forgot mine and told her “I’m in a lot of pain and I forgot to bring slippers” and she looked me dead in the eyes and mocked me in a high-pitched voice, repeating “I’M in a lot of PAIN” sarcastically. For context: I had literally told her I was struggling to walk and felt unsafe without support; she responded by mocking me.

She invited me to a double date at someone’s house, where I was asked to take off my therapeutic shoes. I had a very hard and painful time walking (I mask extremely well due to learning how to walk again over the course of a year), while she casually put on the host’s (one of her close friend’s) slippers. She also sent me Instagram posts of physical games and sent them to me saying “I would totally beat you.” I finally snapped and said, “Yeah, because I was in a car accident and I’m permanently disabled and cannot function the way my body used to.” She responded, “Okay, then we can blindfold me and give you a 5-second head start.” These comments happened consistently although I am only listing several to give context.

Since I blocked her, she keeps posting things clearly aimed at me - stuff like “All my emotionally intelligent friends think you’re wrong,” “My ex is emotionally immature,” “You lied to make people dislike me, and I have to lie to make people like you” “You played in my face,”  “No women wants to date another Indian women” and a bunch of other things calling me a piece of shit. It’s humiliating to be associated with.

And I’m only now finding out she’s been telling other people, including people I don’t even know, about my car accident and disability. I never gave her permission to share that nor have I ever shared any personal details about her trauma with a single one of my friends.

So… AITA for ending things? Am I overreacting over the comments she made? Because part of me feels insane, but another part feels like this was months of inappropriate behavior, boundary violations, ableism, and now a bizarre smear campaign - and I don’t understand how breaking up just transformed into this especially when she was telling me that she thought everything was perfect during our relationship and felt stupid that I was ending it because she messed up and also asked if we could try again in the future? I don’t understand what I did, I feel like an asshole to elicit these types of emotions.

Like the other day I bought a coffee without doing the mental guilt math afterward and it hit me how different that felt compared to a few years ago.   
I always thought FIRE would be this big finish line one day, but now it feels more like a slow rewiring realizing I don’t want “rich,” I want options. I want days that aren’t controlled by someone else’s schedule. I want to breathe easier instead of chasing some perfect future.

I can’t take it anymore. I can’t enjoy life. I settle for a day of little pain and sensitivity rather than a lot of pain.

Granted, I had long term anxiety before that. But I refuse to believe that’s the sole reason for what I’m going through.

I always had somewhat sensitive stomach.

8.5 months ago, I had 2 cups of coffee in the morning, back to back. In half an hour I felt extremely full, acid or some sort of stomach juice was going up all the way up to back of my throat. Ever since I feel something inside my stomach got broken. 

I’ve had many painful nights. My GP didn’t do much about it. 

My symptoms: 
- upper stomach pain (right below rib cage, slightly to the left)
- sensitivity
- nausea 
- IBS-C like symptoms (never been diagnosed, also never been tested for bowel issues)
- hemorrhoids
- blood in stool (a few times in the last 1 year)
- don’t get urge to poo everyday 

I’ve been on PPI for the last 2 months. I think it helped with pain a little, but didn’t really fix the issue. It feels like a patch and I still get a lot of pain if I eat a full meal.

Test results from 7 months ago: 
Labs are ok
H.pylori negative
Lactose intolerance was discovered

Also recently got an ultrasound that was also clear

I’m booked for a gastroscopy but that’s 1.5 months later. I don’t feel strong enough to keep doing this every day until then. 

What should I do other than waiting for my gastroscopy? My life is just passing me by while I suffer in pain. Is it something I’m doing to myself? I read a lot about the vagus nerve, hyper sensitivity of the stomach and chronic inflammation. I have no clue if these are my issues or not, but these appear to be the most common reasons.

It wasn’t part of the plan. The plan was to rent somewhere small, get my bearings again after she died, and maybe try to rebuild the pieces of my life that fell apart with her. But when I went to collect her things, I couldn’t leave. There was something about the house, something that felt like unfinished business.

It’s the same old two-story I grew up in. White siding, creaky porch, the faint smell of dust and lavender.

My mother loved that smell. She said it calmed the house down.

Even as a kid, though, I never felt calm here. I used to tell her the walls made noises when I was alone, little groans, sighs, a kind of hum when I cried.

She’d laugh and say *“Old houses settle, Clara. They creak because they’re alive in their own way.”*

I thought she meant it metaphorically. I don’t anymore.

The first few nights back were normal enough. Lonely, yes. Too quiet.

I couldn’t sleep in my old bedroom, it still had those faint outlines on the wall from where I’d taped up posters, like ghosts of teenage years I’d rather forget. So I took my mother’s room instead. Her perfume lingered on the curtains, and the bed still dipped on her side, as if she’d only just gotten up.

I started cleaning during the day. Sorting through her things. Trying to make the place feel like *mine*.

That’s when it started, small things, things I told myself were coincidence.

One afternoon I caught myself thinking *this dresser would* look *better by the* window. The next morning, it was. I laughed it off, assuming I’d moved it and forgotten.

But then it happened again.

I was reaching for the hallway light switch, but the switch wasn’t there. Instead, it was on the *other* wall, right where my hand had hesitated a moment before.

My stomach dropped, like missing a step on the stairs.

I told myself I was misremembering, that grief makes people fuzzy. That night, I walked through the house taking pictures, of the layout, of where everything was, so I could prove to myself it wasn’t moving.

The next day, the photos didn’t match.

It wasn’t dramatic, not at first. Doors an inch off, stair count one higher. The kitchen window slightly taller. I thought maybe I was going insane. I even scheduled an appointment with a therapist. But then, the house started… helping me.

When I’d think about coffee, I’d find the mug already waiting on the counter.  
When I’d feel cold, the heat would hum to life without me touching the thermostat.  
One night, I couldn’t find my phone, I whispered, “Where did I leave it?” and the bedroom light flickered, like a nod. I found it glowing on the nightstand.

It felt like the house cared.

It was subtle, intimate, almost maternal. Like it wanted to take care of me the way she used to.

I told myself that was comforting.

But comfort doesn’t last here.

The first time I got angry, I felt it breathe.

I was trying to open a jammed drawer, my mother’s old jewelry box, the one with the music that never worked, and it wouldn’t budge. I yanked harder, muttering under my breath, *“For God’s sake, open!”*

Every door in the house slammed at once.

The windows rattled. The air pressure changed, like before a storm. And then… it was still.

I stood there shaking, trying to laugh it off. *“Old houses,”* I whispered. But I could feel something watching me, not from a corner or doorway, but from the walls themselves.

After that, I started testing it.

When I felt sad, the lights dimmed.

When I panicked, the hallway stretched, I swear to you, it elongated, the end of it sliding further away as I ran. When I calmed down, it shrank again.

I told myself it was grief. Stress. Trauma. All the buzzwords therapists love to use.

But then, I started noticing something worse.

The house wasn’t reacting *to* me anymore. It was *anticipating.*

I’d reach for the faucet, it would turn before my fingers touched it. I’d think about checking the mail, and hear the front door unlatch on its own. I’d dream about my mother, and wake up to find her perfume thick in the air, as if she’d been standing right over me.

The final straw was the basement.

I’ve always hated that basement. As a kid, I refused to go down there. My mother kept the door locked most of the time anyway. Said it was for *storage,* though I don’t ever remember her storing anything.

Last week, I was sitting in the living room when I heard something moving beneath the floorboards. Slow, deliberate, like someone dragging furniture.

I froze. Then, I heard a whisper:

*“Come see what I’ve made for you.”*

It was my mother’s voice.

I wanted to run, but the hallway had already shifted, the front door was gone. Only one door remained open. The basement.

I don’t remember walking down the stairs. I just remember the smell, wet earth, lavender, and something metallic underneath.

The basement was larger than it should’ve been. The floor sloped downward, the walls bending in impossible curves. The wallpaper from upstairs bled into concrete, as though the house was *growing downward.*

At the center was a new door. One I’d never seen.

It was painted white, but wet, like the paint hadn’t dried. I touched it, and the door *breathed.*

The wood expanded against my palm, warm and pulsing. I stepped back, trembling.

The whisper came again, closer this time:

*“You’ve been thinking so loudly, Clara.”*

*“We only wanted to help.”*

I screamed and ran back up the stairs, but they wouldn’t end. The steps kept repeating, looping like an optical illusion. The house was folding in on itself, reconfiguring. Every thought I had became a direction.

*Don’t close in:* the ceiling lowered.  
*Don’t lock me in:* the door vanished.  
*Stop stop stop:* the walls pulsed harder, almost shuddering.

I blacked out.

When I woke up, I was in bed. Morning light filtering through the curtains. Everything normal again. The furniture in its place.

For a while, I convinced myself it had been a nightmare.

Until I saw the note on my dresser. My mother’s handwriting.

*“Don’t leave again. The house gets lonely.”*

The note was written on wallpaper, wallpaper that matched the basement.

I’ve tried leaving. I’ve *tried.*

Every time I pack my bags, something goes wrong. The tires deflate. The front door locks itself. My phone refuses to dial anyone but *“Mom.”*

And she answers.

Sometimes I hear her humming through the vents at night, the same lullaby she sang when I was small. Sometimes I smell that lavender perfume, and the walls ripple softly, as if pleased.

I think the house is keeping me safe.

No...

I think it’s keeping me.

Because last night, I dreamt of that white door again. I could hear breathing on the other side, slow, steady, in sync with mine.

When I woke up, there was a new door in the hallway. This one red. Wet. Waiting.

I think it wants to make me part of it.

Maybe that’s what happened to her.

Maybe that’s why the house always felt alive.

If anyone reading this knows anything about old homes, foundations that shift, blueprints that don’t stay consistent, please tell me if this is possible. Tell me there’s a reason.

Because I looked up property records.

This house has stood here since 1913. It’s been sold sixteen times. Every owner listed as “deceased on property.”

But there’s one detail that makes my skin crawl.

Each record lists a different floor plan.

And the most recent one, the one dated this year, has a new room added.

A bedroom.

We arrived at 10:05am and due to poor line queue logistics resulted in a 20 minute wait (bottleneck of 2 elevators, but also no access to stairs). Upon entry, we were provided a booklet with info on all the vendors to write notes down if desired. Inside, it felt overwhelming because the space was too tight. Crowd control was not ideal with people jammed and not grabbing their piece and making space, instead they just loitered by the vendor tables. Amazing that the vendors were from every where, including Canada and Denmark! A Dallas-based (Starship Bagel) took the medal! Downside is that most of the vendors served stale/cold bagels and felt like I couldn’t really judge them as well. Several vendors were lox-based so higher quality products at some. The sponsors were King Arthur Flour and Mike’s Hot Honey – both of which provided free samples (5lb flour, NYT cookbook, bottle of honey)! Bagel Market also gave out free swag (high quality baseball hat, tote bag). There was plenty of space to sit-down/stand to enjoy the food. There was also a Yelp photobooth area with props and cool event photo banner (no prints but electronic copies)! There was 1 station for coca-cola and zero coca-cola cans but they ran out an hour in of the coke zeros. Many trash cans were filled to the brim (mostly due to the large tray). By 11:30am, the place had cleared out – so the sweet spot to arrive within the morning slot.

Personal qualms: There should be designated coffee vendor to buy coffee. Vendors should offer open faced bagels.  

This was a fun one-time experience but expensive for what it was. Even more worth it if you secure tickets at the early bird rate $49. We finished in a little over an hour and were stuffed to the brim!

Do I spill the beans immediately?,"So I (35M) have been in a relationship with my (47F) girlfriend for 9 Years. Previously, I had been feeling very content in our relationship, especially this past year. We have been doing a lot of traveling and it feels like our bond became deeper, like we figured out life together and how to make it work. But because my freelancing job is hit or miss - I had to pick up another job at a local bar/restaurant to help make ends meet.   
  
I have been working there 4/5 months. A member of the kitchen staff is a 41F, who I have found attractive since I began working there but that's been about the extent of my feelings.

Fast Forward a couple months and both my coworker and I were out of town for about a month doing our own separate things. Things were great - my girlfriend and I had a great trip and I didn't think about my coworker at all, because nothing had developed... yet.

Since we both returned from our trip though, something happened. I literally forgot about her until one day opening, I heard her voice in the kitchen - I immediately got the butterflies for my coworker and noticed my crush intensified.  

We have only worked together twice since we've been back but something feels like it is quickly escalating on both our parts. We are constantly making eye contact, or she is putting her hand on my shoulder and leaving it there longer than you normally would. And it gets me very excited.

Last shift we worked together, she gave me her number and said we should get coffee sometime. I told my boss about this, because he is a very good friend and he thinks that this can all be easily explained with a legitimate reason - and he's not even sure the coworker even likes men. 

Now, I'm pretty certain the feelings I've been having for my coworker are mutual but I'm not 100%. And normally this would be a no brainer for how to navigate this - tell my girlfriend. 

However, next week is Thanksgiving and it is my Gfs moms bday, literally on Thanksgiving day, in which they will be coming up and staying the week. 

I don't know how to navigate this scenario - Do I wait to tell my girlfriend until after her family leaves for the holiday? Do I confront my coworker with my feelings ASAP? And tell my girlfriend immediately as well?

I just want to navigate this in the best way possible for everyone involved - seeking female advice!",0,1763498661.0,relationship_advice,21,0.22,False

Some notes: I've seen a handful of the titles in this list already, but have chosen to include those titles still for the sake of avoiding recommendations I'm already familiar with. Titles ending with (!) are titles I've seen already. I would also generally prefer to avoid content that includes real animal deaths unless there's some other significant element to the movie that makes it worth enduring. Lastly, I know there are a hundred iterations of this thread out there. I've read all that I can find on Reddit, and also recognize that new titles fitting this description may have emerged since the last time it was discussed. Thanks everyone!

David

The morning was colder than it should’ve been.

David stood at the top of the concrete steps outside his apartment, hands buried in the sleeves of his hoodie. He hadn't slept. Not a minute. Not after the episode he released hours ago—the one that cracked open a vault no one had wanted to admit was real.

It wasn’t just a podcast anymore.

It was a trigger.

He didn’t know the cops were already on their way.

The unmarked car rolled to the curb with quiet finality. Two detectives stepped out, their coats too clean for the neighborhood. The taller one held up his badge.

“David Serna?”

David blinked, tightening his grip inside his sleeves. “Yeah.”

“We’d like you to come with us.”

He hesitated. “Am I being arrested?”

The second one, heavier and visibly exhausted, shook his head. “Not yet. But we have questions. You’ll want to cooperate.”

Sam Carter stepped around from the car, arms crossed. His expression wasn’t hostile—just heavy with expectation.

“Let’s go,” he said.

David nodded and stepped into the car.

Inside the Precinct

The air inside the station smelled like cold coffee and old carpeting. David sat across from Carter and Torres at a small table in an interview room. A single red light blinked on the recorder between them.

“You made a hell of noise,” Torres said, flipping through a printout of transcripts from David’s podcast.

David leaned in. “It’s all in the case files. You had the same evidence I did. You just didn’t look.”

David stared at the recorder. “he started with my mother. And I think… I think he knew me.”

Torres raised an eyebrow. “You’re saying you met this guy?”

“I don’t remember. Not clearly. Just flashes. But that note…” He paused. “It wasn’t written for the world. It was written for me. He knew I’d find it. Eventually.”

Sam leaned forward, elbows on the table. “We’re not treating you as a suspect, David. But you’re close to this. Closer than anyone’s ever been. If he’s reaching out to you—”

“He’s not reaching out,” David said. “He’s performing. And I’ve become the audience.”

They questioned him for over an hour. About the podcast. About his research. About the timeline of his obsession. They didn’t say it, but he knew what they were really wondering.

Was he too close? Too damaged? Too useful?

When they let him go, a camera crew was already outside the station. He ignored the shouted questions and walked straight through the crowd, hoodie pulled low over his face.

His name was no longer anonymous.

But the story wasn’t over.

Not yet.

Elsewhere – The Whisperer’s Room

The TV flickered in the corner, casting soft light across the room’s padded walls. The audio was low, barely audible under the hum of an old shortwave radio. On the screen, David was being led from the precinct, shoulders tense, eyes heavy with sleep deprivation and something worse memory.

The banner across the news feed read: “PODCASTER AT CENTER OF SERIAL KILLER INVESTIGATION.”

The Echo sat in a well-worn armchair, his coat folded neatly beside him. A mug of tea steamed in his hand, untouched.

He watched David’s face on the screen, watched the boy he had seen long ago become a man.

The voice in the interview cracked faintly through the radio. Just a clip, a breath.

But it was enough.

“You’re finally listening,” the Keeper whispered to himself.

He picked up his notebook.

On the first page of a new section, he wrote:

“If death is welcome let him seek it there.”

Then he turned to the pages he had written before filled with names, phrases, deaths. Each one a chord in the symphony. A silence sculpted into meaning.

He chose one phrase. Short. Measured. Deliberate.

“There a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life”

He slid it into a plastic sleeve, folded it, and pressed it between the pages of book.

A favorite, now more than just metaphor.

He paused over one name on the final page of his list.

Not chosen yet. But very close.

He looked back at the screen.

“Soon,” he murmured, and the static swallowed his voice.",2,1763498607.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I am planning a trip to the UK the last week of December. I wanted to spend two nights in Cotswold and my understanding is that I can take a train from London to Cotswold. I'm interested in a laid back trip: some scenic walks, coffee shops, places to read, maybe a spa day. I will be a solo female traveler.

1p0na7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1p0na7o/novocain/,Novocain,"Frank wrote like his veins were typewriters. Each line tapped out in Morse code, a signal from the edge. His poems hit like jazz in a thunderstorm—beautiful, erratic, soaked in pain. The collective called him a genius. Said his metaphors were “transcendent.” Said he was “channeling the divine.” But Frank knew the truth. He wasn’t channeling God. He was chasing ghosts. And the bag aka cocaine was his Ouija board.

Cocaine didn’t knock on his door. It slithered in through the cracks. First it was a bump at a party, then a ritual before writing. Then it was breakfast. Then it was church. Then it was everything.

He called it “Novocain” in his verses. Said it numbed the ache, made the world feel like velvet. But velvet turns to sand when the high fades. And Frank? He was drowning in it.

The collective—The Ink Syndicate—met every Thursday in a loft that smelled like old books and ambition. They’d sit in a circle, sipping overpriced coffee, dissecting each other’s work like surgeons. Frank would read his pieces, voice low, eyes glassy.

“My tongue is a scalpel, my thoughts are stitched with snow.
I kiss the mirror, and it kisses back slow.”

They’d snap fingers. They’d cry. They’d call him “the prophet of pain.” But none of them knew he was writing from the brink. One bag away from becoming a cautionary tale.

Frank lived in a studio apartment with cracked walls and a mattress that sagged like his spirit. He kept his stash in a hollowed-out copy of Leaves of Grass. Ironic. He hadn’t felt grass under his feet in months. Just carpet and regret.

He’d write for hours, nose bleeding, heart racing. His poems were beautiful lies. Metaphors wrapped in silk, hiding the rot underneath. He knew it. But he couldn’t stop. The bag gave him rhythm. Gave him courage. Gave him the illusion of control.

Until it didn’t.

One night, he OD’d. Alone. No applause. No snaps. Just silence and a twitch. He woke up on the floor, vomit in his beard, poem half-written on the wall in Sharpie:

“I tried to fly with wax wings,
but the sun was pure and unforgiving.”

That was the turning point. Not because he feared death. He’d made peace with that. But because he realized he wasn’t writing anymore. He was bleeding. And the page was just a bandage.

He quit cold. No rehab. No sponsor. Just rage and resolve. The Ink Syndicate noticed the shift. His poems lost their shimmer. No more velvet. Just gravel.

“I used to write in code.
Now I write in scars.”

They didn’t get it. Said he was “losing his edge.” Said he needed to “find the magic again.” But Frank wasn’t chasing magic anymore. He was chasing truth.

He started writing essays. Raw. Unfiltered. No metaphors. Just memories. The first time he snorted. The first time he lied to his mother. The first time he sold his keyboard for a gram.

The collective didn’t publish them. Said it was “too dark.” Said it lacked “poetic nuance.” But the streets? The streets listened. Young cats with shaky hands and dreams too big for their blocks started quoting him. Started emailing him. Started asking how to quit.

Frank became a lighthouse. Not bright. Not perfect. But steady.

He still missed the bag. Some nights, he’d stare at that hollowed-out book and feel the itch. But he’d write instead. Not poems. Not lies. Just truth.

“Cocaine didn’t kill me.
It just made me forget I was alive.”

That line went viral. Not on social media. In rehab centers. In prison libraries. In halfway houses. It became a mantra.

Frank never got his old rhythm back. But he found something better. Resonance.

He wasn’t the prophet of pain anymore. He was the scribe of survival.",1,1763498512.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Just to clarify, i’m NOT looking for films that are similar to mulholland drive thematically necessarily. 

What i’m looking for is a film that is disorienting and dizzy. something that is surreal and genuinely terrifying. i want to be scared!!!! 

In the last section of Mulholland Drive, i really like how scenes bleed into each other. how a cup of coffee will somehow transform into a glass of whiskey, how reality doesn’t quite make sense, how scenes are put together in a way that is confusing and frightening. i’m looking for something tense and exhilarating, something that’ll make my heart race. especially if the acting performances are unhinged and intense. 

i’ve seen every lynch film and i love all of them. i’ve watched basically every usually recommendation people usually get when they want something similar to lynch (lanthimos, von trier, bergman, kiyoshi kurosawa, robert eggers, satoshi kon, cronenberg, etc etc). so im looking for something that isn’t usually recommended

So I've been seeing these portable ice cream makers pop up everywhere, and I finally caved and got one last month. A bunch of people have been asking me if it's actually worth the money or just another kitchen gadget that'll collect dust. Here's my honest take.

**What I Actually Use It For**

I'm not gonna lie – I thought this would be one of those things I'd use twice and forget about. But it's actually become my go-to for making quick frozen treats. The whole process takes like 20-30 minutes, which is way faster than traditional ice cream machines that need those bowls frozen overnight.

I make ice cream obviously, but also sorbet when I want something lighter, and even frozen yogurt for breakfast sometimes. My kids are obsessed with making their own flavors now, which keeps them entertained on weekends.

**The Real Benefits**

The biggest win for me is portion control. Instead of buying a whole tub from the store (which I'll definitely finish in two days), I make exactly what we need. Plus, I actually know what's going into it – no weird preservatives or ingredients I can't pronounce.

It's also way smaller than regular ice cream makers. I live in an apartment, so counter space is precious. This thing fits in my cabinet easily, and I can pull it out whenever I get a craving.

**Is It Actually Worth Your Money?**

Here's the thing – if you like ice cream and eat it regularly, then yeah, a portable ice cream maker is definitely worth it. I did the math, and I'm already saving money compared to buying premium ice cream from the store every week.

But if you're someone who has ice cream maybe once a month, probably skip it. It's not expensive, but why spend money on something you won't use?

I got mine through [this link](https://athomewave.com/portable-ice-cream-maker) and it's been solid. The price was reasonable, and it came with some recipe ideas which actually helped me get started.

**Quick Tips If You Get One**

Pre-freeze your ingredients a bit. Room temperature cream takes forever to freeze.

Keep your mix-ins small. Big chunks of cookies or candy don't mix well.

Clean it right away. Dried ice cream is annoying to scrub off.

**Final Thoughts**

Look, I'm not saying this is a must-have kitchen essential like a good knife or cutting board. But if you're someone who enjoys homemade desserts and wants to experiment with flavors, it's a fun addition to your kitchen. My favorite so far has been coffee ice cream with chocolate chips – way better than anything I've bought at the grocery store.

The convenience factor is real. No planning ahead, no waiting overnight, just decide you want ice cream and make it happen. For me, that alone makes it worthwhile.

If you're thinking about getting one, you can check out different options and read reviews [here](https://athomewave.com/portable-ice-cream-maker). Just make sure you actually read the product details and pick one that fits what you need.

I’ve (29F, 5’4) lost 44 lbs so far this year, going from 165 lbs to 121 lbs. I’m still dieting and determined to tone up & reach my dream body.

I had lost weight 4 years ago, going from 175 lbs to 125 lbs. But I slowly gained it all back due to depression. I really deeply resented myself for re-gaining all that weight. I started to only wear baggy T-shirts and oversized jeans.

Since reaching 125 lbs, I’ve started getting such better treatment in life. Men are so much nicer to me, and compliment me regularly. Women are also friendlier, and seem less dismissive of me. At my workplace there are a lot of athletes, and it used to destroy me. Seeing such fit and active people, while I’m in such a fat body made my self esteem plummet.

Now, when I see beautiful people I don’t immediately spiral or binge eat. I can actually wear cute outfits and feel attractive, instead of a pig with lipstick on. I feel such a deep sense of peace, compared to the constant internal screaming when I was fat. I still honestly have a lot of body goals, I want to push myself to become the best version of me.

Losing weight has felt like coming back home to myself, being me again. I can wear cute outfits, I can feel pretty, I can even feel relaxed now. Because all that time I spent hating myself and my body is now time spent taking care of myself. For me personally, being fat absolutely destroyed my mental health. I couldn’t even function because I was so ashamed of the state of myself. Now, it’s like having a clean slate to rebuild my life again.

I’ve even gotten into a relationship, when before I was single and socially isolated for 5 years. Around 130 lbs, I struggled a lot with confidence and intimacy. But since losing another 10 lbs, I’m started to feel better about myself. I can’t lie, I started losing weight rapidly when I developed a crush on my boyfriend. It was such a wake-up call, I realized I’m not even myself at that high weight.

The best tips that worked for me:

Calorie count, get more steps in, go to therapy, track weight weekly, portion control is king, eat satiating foods, popcorn not chips, eat a lot of soup, load up on fruits and vegetables, no soda, no sweet coffees, limit fried foods, eat less carbs and more protein.

I track my calories daily on the app LoseIt! which is 100% non-negotiable now. Over the summer I didn’t track calories, and I didn’t lose any weight for over 2 months. I’ve truly listened to the saying “80% diet, 20% movement” for weight loss, and I’m really happy with my results. Of course I wish I’d have lifted weights, as I’d have my dream body by now. But going from fat to slim, feels pretty good regardless.",1,1763498127.0,loseit,0,0.6,False

Probably my last Alkemia post in a while - I've basically reviewed every sample I've accumulated in a year-ish (as usual, why Alkemia, because they're one of the easiest to get in the EU and I've FSed several of their fragrances already). It's not like I've gotten through their \*entire\* catalog but I don't have any real interest in: their pheromones (saw mixed reviews), the single notes (I did get a few, like a free sample here, and do enjoy their dirt note a lot - but overall I have a pretty good idea of their basic notes), the ""Last Chance"" items that are only available in 5ml but don't sound very interesting to me, and the ""Last Chance"" items that are available in vials but they are sort of ambiguous about whether they'll have them in stock again or not.

So here's the category that I saved for last because it's quite dear to my heart: white florals! I'm a Lush Lust lover, so that's the sort of whiteflowerhead we're talking about here! (+ my last remaining, unrelated samples)

**STARDUST (cream musk, winter-white amber, almond cookies, dried jasmine flowers, and white cacao with a snow-wind breath of cool ozone, fresh evergreen boughs, and a sprig of mistletoe. )** In the vial: definitely a lot of Alkemia’s almond notes, and something that’s reading… nail polish…? On the skin: a blast of almost-minty ozone to go along with the cookies - immediately sets it apart from similar almond cookie scents like Magpie’s Rhyme (almond, milk and cashmere). The mistletoe is quite present, it’s a bit more aromatic than just evergreen. The base definitely has that buttery, salty white amber but not as rich as some of the other ones, balanced by some powdery cleanliness from the white musk. It’s sweet- one review I saw compares this to powdered sugar and I think that’s correct, rather than any sort of caramel or syrup. There is a delicate touch of cacao powder that plays well with the sugar but it’s not the star of the show, it's not a hot chocolate scent. Less of a cozy scent than Magpie’s Rhyme, a bit more of a detached cool person vibe to it. The light mintiness contrasted with sweetness reminds me of Falling Snow Angels (mint, vanilla cream and patchouli) a bit, too, but the mint is more subtle here (heavier on the ozone) and there is no metallic patchouli base, rather a buttery white amber with cacao powder. The jasmine is very light, just reads as fresh alongside the ozone. It feels like mixing The Magpie’s Rhyme and Falling Snow Angels but I like the result slightly less than them separately - almond cookies and mint might just be a tad too discordant. But it’s quite beautiful nonetheless as long as you don't mind Alkemia's strong almond note, it does something different with it rather than the usual cozy almond cookies or sexy amaretto. **8/10**.

**ENCHANTRESS (amaretto liqueur, cinnamon, citrus peel, star jasmine, orchid, mandorla amara, Bourbon vanilla caramels, guaiac wood, sweet vetiver root, and sexy botanical pheromones.)** In the vial: amaretto, unsurprisingly. The vanilla makes it very much gourmand, like amaretto biscuits. On the skin: again, very unsubtle (like most Alkemia amarettos…). It does have some shades of sweet orchid and a spicy green star jasmine, but barely, in a bit of fine, mainstream ""sophisticated"" florals way. As it calms down it starts letting some citrus peel oil through. I feel like there are very faint animalics - the pheromones?? It's not quite leather, a bit more wet fur and musky. This turns into a more ambery, caramel fragrance as it dries. Very lightly boozy, like almond cake with caramel soaked in liquor, though less of a realistic gourmand and more like an amber with those characteristics. The cinnamon is very very faint on me. The base is smoky woods and, as I mentioned, musky. I don't get much earthy vetiver. It's not for me - if I'm going all out on a gourmand I'm going all out - but this is a bit on the elegant amber side. I find the heart of this is a pretty safe, wearable fragrance (faint citrus, star jasmine, orchid and wood) but the almond, caramel and musk give it its own personality. On me it's slightly too much of a heady amber, I think they went a bit too hard on the pheromones and something about this smells “sweaty” to me. A **5/10** for my tastes, but it’s sort of interchangeable with others in this family that I think are better (including the next one…).

**WICKED CHARMS (REVISITED) (incense lilies, muskroot, star jasmine, white pepper flowers, Queen Elizabeth root, black vanilla, and honey amber caramel.)** In the vial: lilies for sure, but there is a definite “gum drops” candy smell here that I'm surprised isn't listed! On the skin: a heady amber caramel with vanilla does come out, almost chocolate-y in how rich it is, stronger than this candy. The incense is playing nicely here, smoky and pleasant, not headshop-y. First time I reviewed this I mentioned earthy, herbal qualities but those have… gone down a bit? Which is a shame, I LIKED those and that's why I gave it a 9/10! They are definitely there brightening it the way I wish Enchantress had been brightened, and the incense base works very well here, without being overpowering. I initially wondered if there was some honeysuckle here (hence the similarity to Candy Box Alchemy) but I think It might be a touch of their buttery white amber. It's playing well with the Incense and purple florals, which give some powdery counterbalance to this without making it a powdery smell. Definitely under Alkemia’s caramelly offers, a bit more sophisticated through the incense and the lightest earthy roots, though it goes down to a **7/10** because I liked the stronger herbal elements. Now it falls a bit more into the generic Alkemia caramels, though a fine enough version of it. I'll have to do a fuller wear to see if I find those elements again.

**OF VICE AND VIRTUE (White crystalline sugar musk, heliotrope, fleshy peaches, piquant damson, spicy dianthus, nyctophilic white florals, sassafras, rosewood, santal, and tonka.)** In the vial: definitely sugared plums with some fresh astringency. On the skin: yeah, this is heavy on the stone fruits, it has that sweet but tart edge to it and an almost grape syrup vibe. The florals aren’t sharp, they have some definite indolic character that is doing its best to fight the base of this - which is sugar and baby-wipes-clean white musk. On the other hand, the heliotrope is very very present (I tend not to be able to recognize specific florals, but it smells exactly like the one in Old Books and Fresh flowers) and is enhancing the powdery aspects to this, so that the final result is a bit more clean and sweet than white-floral or fruity (though the stone fruits ARE brightening this, a lot). Alkemia also likes to pair this white musk with sandalwood and tonka which gives this salty, creamy but clean base. These tend not to be my favorites but, like Affaire de Coeur, I think it’s a fine enough version of white musk, not one of my least favorites. If you want something with gourmand and sugary-tart elements that still smells fresh, clean and inoffensive I think this is good (but Affair de Coeur is nicer for me) **6/10**

**HELL COURTISAN (REVISITED) (sharp green aldehydes, peaches, black vanilla, Nicotania noctiflora, dark red roses, funereal lilies, chrysanthemums, and tuberoses with blood-blackened oakmoss, opium, cedarwood ossuaries, brimstone.)** In the vial: ah, that seems to have improved with resting - still a tuberose-heavy white floral, but there’s a lot of green elements there (not overly fizzy aldehydes). On the skin: some powdery rose and lilies right off the bat, it’s less of a sweet tuberose - there is some spicy, almost tobacco note to this, and a bit of “long-burnt” coals smoke. It’s heavier on the oakmoss now, it actually almost reads masculine to me, despite being a white floral. Don’t get the fizzy soda element I usually get from aldehydes, there is some stone fruit tartness here but it’s less peach-heavy than Of Vice and Virtue. A very mature, almost sophisticated perfume. I used to get only the white florals from this but now this is much nicer: it’s a heavy, almost indolic white floral (my favorite type) where the other elements are secondary but very present: the rose and lilies don’t take over but have a powdery counterbalance to the indolic florals, the brimstone isn’t smoky bbq but does give a smoky edge to this that plays well with the cleaner cedar and the masculine oakmoss, and even the peaches brighten this slightly. The other notes, not so sure. It’s pretty good! **9/10**, which isn’t an automatic FS for me because I just love white florals too much and I can’t get them all. But nice to see it benefits from resting!

**KASHISH (white gardenias, tuberose, night blooming jasmine, and vanilla orchid.)** In the vial: a rather powdery white floral, moreso than any bubblegummy tuberose. On the skin: awww yeah that’s night blooming jasmine babeyyy. So intense you can almost smell the rest of the bush. Heady, heady florals, but with still a good helping of powdery gardenia (or the tuberose?). As I said, I don’t have a well-trained enough nose to tell white florals apart from each other perfectly, but I can tell you this doesn’t have much vanilla or what I associate with a fresher orchid. It’s heady, almost indolic jasmine, some powdery tuberose/gardenia, and only a very slight tropical touch (tuberose?). It is creamy and rich at the base though, so that might be a very well-handled vanilla contributing to that, but it’s not gourmand whatsoever. A pretty realistic white floral (not 100% realistic, it has vanilla instead of dirt/leaves, but the flowers themselves are realistic), **9/10** because I’m a pure whiteflowerhead - not 10/10 like, say, Aelfscyne, because it feels less complex and “unique” (and there are slight powdery (gardenia?) elements I’m not the biggest fan of).

**MIDNIGHT GARDEN (tuberose, lily, honeysuckle, gardenia and moonflower)** In the vial: definitely the lily that Kashish doesn’t have, fresher. On the skin: much less of a heady white floral, it opens almost fresh and fizzy, definitely a whole heap of lily. There are indolic white florals (the moonflower I guess, it reads quite jasmine to me) but I’m essentially only getting the indole under the lily, not the full flower in bloom - in some ways it’s making it a more realistic “bringing a dewy flower to your nose and sniffing” experience than Kashish (that fresh, sharper floral smell flowers have up close), as Kashish goes more for the whole garden. At the same time this skips the powdery elements of Kashish, so that’s a plus. But definitely the lily is making this read much more as a freshie you could throw on for the gym. It still maintains the other elements, so i’d say it’s well blended, but also less exciting - Kashish is much more… sensual, I suppose, but this one is more of a crowd pleasing white floral. It’s fine- which for white florals means it’s a **7/10**. Just a bit too sharp (someone agreed it was ""too much"" on my wrist, but they do have a sensitive nose).

**NOCTURNES OF THE HONEYSUCKLE (Night blooming honeysuckle, sweet galium, sweet fern, soft mosses, delicate vanilla and fresh tea leaves.)** In the vial: unmistakable honeysuckle, though there is a bit of herbal greens and some freshness. On the skin: that’s heavier on the fern and moss than expected! Quite green, almost like Moss Maiden or Vert Sur Le Vert - less cold and mineralistic (“Irish spring”ish) than the former, less salad-greens-and-tomato than the latter. The type of sweet greens that pair well with the “herbal” (ie not gourmand) vanilla, helped by the very very sweet, honey-like flowers. Reminds me a bit of (the discontinued) Fireflies in the Garden, which also had honeysuckle - but that had a very melon-leaning Holboellia, this is just pure honeysuckle nectar and summer greens. The (white, to my nose) tea comes out a bit as it dries, providing a bit of freshness (what the vial smelled of) which is welcomed in this very sweet perfume. To me it's a more pleasant way to make the scent fresher than the lily. Not a “real/indolic” “white floral” in the way of Midnight Garden or Kashish, it leans much more on the sweet aspects of these flowers. A similar composition is Lucky Alchemy but that’s heavier on the cream/vanillic elements, it plays a much more supporting role here, and is a bit more nutty. Is it a very complex composition? Not really. Does it get **10/10**? Absolutely, because I love honeysuckle and I love Alkemia’s greens. This smells like a balmy, sweaty summer night in the best way possible.

**LOVE UNFORESEEN (white musk, Persian chandelier lily, night blooming jasmine, tulip, honeysuckle, tonka bean, bergamot, white pepper, white amber, china clay, and the silvery aquatics of melting snow.)** In the vial: a very soft watery floral, that “generic flower shop bouquet sprayed with water” (I think that’s their tulip). On the skin: ohh, that’s more complex than Nocturnes. Much less honeysuckle, tampered by the fresher lily and tulip and some musty aquatics. There is a touch of rich white amber but it’s light. While it’s overall much fainter, there are some indolic elements here from the jasmine. This feels like a slightly more complex Midnight Garden, but also like a more boring Aelfscyne. The aquatics are halfway between fresh and powdery, not too cologney (nor minty from the “snow”), like Silver Sky if you’ve smelled that one, almost musty florals. That and the lily make this smell like something that would be a nice deodorant smell. Not in a bad way! Perfectly fine. But if I want something honeysuckle-heavy that’s more complex than Midnight Garden, I’d rather go for Aelfscyne with its dusty cashmeran backdrop and its creamy vanillic white amber. A safe **7/10** \- but might be for you if you have the opposite white flower opinions that I do, and you still want a touch of indole but in an overall much more ""wearable"", fresher perfume.

And my final samples...

**MOON LUST (creamy white ambers, blonde woods, and luminescent skin notes.)** In the vial: of course, a buttery rich white amber, but either there's something minty-fresh or I'm going insane. On the skin: ok, that's much less heavy on the white amber than ie Ghostfire, less buttery popcorn than Luminae. It's sweeter and less creamy/salty than Ghost Fire, but less sugared than Foxfire, almost in a gum drop candy way rather than sugared flowers. I don't really get woods. What smelled fresh to me is something that makes me think of… wintergreen?? I don't know. Maybe tuberose? Something that reads bubblegum, either way. It has a bit of a white floral clean edge, and that's about it. Not my favorite your-skin-but-better scent, it's just sort of whatever and I don't think it comes together into anything interesting. **5/10**

**WHO SHALL COMMAND THE HEART (honeyed vanilla, gorse flowers, guaiac wood-infused smoky leather)** In the vial: ohh, that smells like a firecracker that just went off. On the skin: oh my god this opens exactly like my city’s fire festival, it's that burning wood and gunpowder and smoke smell in the best way possible. As it dries though, there is a definite honeyed note, which is making this a bit disconcertingly food-like, like honey bbq ribs. I don't get bbq from perfumes people often call bbq-y (Yladir), but I think the honey and leather do that here. It becomes a bit more apparent as it dries and the powdery, spicy wood also becomes a bit more dominant, the leather is not as dominant but I do think it contributes to that meaty feel. It's funny to me how different the vibes of this are from the “love elixir to make people obsessed with you” description - this seems like a super outdoorsy smell to me. A **8/10** for my tastes (not 10/10 like Yladir because the honey is the slightest bit plasticky and the leather aspect is, again, a bit disconcerting), but watch out because this is basically a bbq smell. 

**SINGLE NOTE FUMEÉ (a true-to-life smoky bonfire).** In the vial: seems a bit more of the smoke-and-wood than just pure bbq. On the skin: yep, that's salty and almost resinous, definitely involves wood smoke, where you can still smell the sap on the freshly-picked pine branches you used for the fire. It's what makes Yladir so beautiful. Who Shall Command The Heart is much more bbq than this due to the supporting notes and the smokiness being enhanced by the guaiac, while this is truly a forest fire smell. **9/10** I guess because I love this note but, again, Yladir is a well-rounded 10/10.

Fumee if you want to smell like the outdoors fire you made \*before\* the barbeque.

  


...and that's all! I've been going through my Alkemia collection, finishing vials by wearing them as daily perfumes (except for the **single** Alkemia that's been too strong to wear without people walking into the room and immediately saying ""what is that???"" - Writer's Blood. I poured that on a potpourri instead), updating my notes on them, comparing to each other and deciding if I want to FS them. I'll continue doing that. As of right now my alcohol-free spray FSs are: Aelfscyne (<3), Fallen Snow Angels, The Magpie's Rhyme (which I've 60% used up already! Great for winter), The First Dandelion (my first Alkemia love), Persian Tea Room, The Raven, and Tulips and Chimneys (which I had a cooler initial impression of but grew on me a lot, and is the most ""floral"" one here - you can tell from this list I'm not a huge floral fan unless they have other things going on, like that one or The Raven). Other than alchemies (which are GREAT for packing for business trips, as they are usually subtle but nice scents) and limited edition stuff, my 5ml vial FSs are The Honored Ghosts, Yladir, and an Au Lait rollerball. There might be some other stuff I'll want to FS (one or two from this list if they're not too similar to Aelfscyne, L'Encens a la Vanille maybe, maybeeee Novella) but for now I'm quite happy with my choices. And I have some Solstice to get through - I've been quite impressed with what I've smelled so far :) Thanks for reading!",8,1763497914.0,Indiemakeupandmore,6,0.91,False

Main Issue:

About 2–3 weeks ago, after running for 20–30 minutes, I suddenly couldn’t move the small toes of my left foot (the big toe was still okay). The foot felt weak and partially numb.

Over the next several days, I began experiencing intermittent tingling or “zap” sensations in different areas:
	•	left foot / leg
	•	left hand (initially)
	•	sometimes right hand or leg
	•	back
	•	pelvic/groin area
	•	occasionally near neck or face

The sensations vary: pins-and-needles, tiny zaps, or mosquito-bite feelings.
They come and go, not constant.

One day after a normal day (bought fruits, coffee, and picked up medicine — nothing heavy), a few hours later both my hands felt shaky, especially the left. My shoulder area also felt slightly numb.
This episode also resolved but added to my worry.

⸻

Timeline:
	1.	Running → sudden left foot weakness
	2.	Tingling began in left hand → then occasional in other limbs
	3.	Blood tests: CBC, liver/kidney, electrolytes, glucose all normal (creatinine 1.26 but within lab range)
	4.	Mild fever at some point — resolved
	5.	One morning: woke with left hand numbness + palm/forearm pain
	6.	Neurologist exam:
	•	Reflexes normal
	•	Mild weakness of left foot dorsiflexion
	•	Sensation normal
	•	No signs of central/neurodegenerative disorders
	7.	Tests ordered: MRI Lumbosacral Spine + NCS of all limbs (I haven’t done them yet due to financial delay)
	8.	Treatment: Gabapentin + nerve vitamins
	9.	Physiotherapy: First session helped temporarily
	10.	Past 2–3 days: tingling/zaps slightly stronger again

⸻

Current symptoms:
	•	Intermittent tingling/zaps anywhere in body
	•	Mild left foot weakness with exertion
	•	Occasional hand shakiness after activity
	•	No constant numbness
	•	No bladder/bowel issues
	•	No balance problems
	•	No weight loss or fever
	•	Symptoms fluctuate throughout the day
	•	Anxiety is worsening the sensations

⸻

Neurologist’s impression:

He suspects either:
	•	Post-viral neuritis, OR
	•	Lumbar nerve root irritation/radiculopathy
He did not suspect a central nervous system disorder, tumor, MS, ALS, or anything emergently serious based on exam.

⸻

Concerns / Questions:
	1.	Does this pattern fit post-viral neuritis, nerve hypersensitivity, or mild lumbar radiculopathy/peroneal nerve irritation?
	2.	Can tingling and zaps appear in multiple body areas with nerve irritation/anxiety?
	3.	Could this be a serious central nervous system condition or cancer?
	4.	Is occasional shakiness in hands (after mild activity) part of nerve irritation or anxiety?
	5.	Is it normal for symptoms to fluctuate and sometimes worsen even while taking Gabapentin?
	6.	Any red flags I should watch for while waiting for MRI/NCS?

I know Reddit isn’t a substitute for medical care, but I want opinions on whether this pattern is consistent with benign nerve irritation or if it warrants urgent concern.

Thank you.

We've been sharing an apartment for about a year, we split the bills right down the middle, and we've got our whole routine down. It felt like we were a team, building something real. We’d cook dinner, complain about work, and plan for the boring adult stuff like saving for a new couch. It all felt so normal and, well, *together*.

Then, the other night, he left his banking app open on his tablet. I was just moving it to clean the coffee table when I saw a weirdly named account: 'Fun Fund.' I know I shouldn't have looked, but my curiosity got the best of me. It turns out, he squirrels away a few hundred bucks a month into this separate account. I started scrolling through the transactions—tickets to a concert I didn't even know he went to, a new expensive headset for his gaming PC, a weekend trip with 'the boys' that he told me was 'just a cheap getaway.'

My stomach just sank. It was like seeing a blueprint for a whole other life he was living, one that I had absolutely no part in. All the exciting, spontaneous, and fun stuff was happening without me, funded by this secret account. Meanwhile, I'm in our shared life, budgeting for groceries and talking about utility bills. It felt like I was the 'Business Manager' of his life, while all the joy was outsourced.

When I brought it up, he was completely casual about it. He said it was just 'his money for his hobbies' and that it didn't affect 'us.' But that’s the whole point, isn't it? It feels like 'us' is the boring, responsible part of his life, and the 'fun' part is something he needs to escape to. I don't want to control his money, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm just a roommate he shares bills with, not a partner he shares a life with.

Am I crazy for feeling hurt by this? Or is it a major red flag that he’s compartmentalizing his happiness away from our relationship?",1,1763497616.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

What I’ve gained from them, however, is invaluable - emotional support, maturity, self-awareness and lots of patience.

I would call myself a good listener, supporter, stubborn and terrible joke teller. My interests are vast but boil down to gaming, gym, walks and coffee. Beneath those can be asked about if someone feels like messaging me.

1p0mv9x,https://i.redd.it/hbfolgrir22g1.png,Quit chasing founders on X. My 50/mo SaaS broke out to 100/mo by actually *helping* people on Reddit (not just promoting). Here's how. 👇,"Hey everyone,



Four months ago, I was ready to throw in the towel. My SaaS projects were barely making enough to buy a coffee, let alone hit any payout thresholds. After months of trying to make X (formerly Twitter) work, I was still stuck at under $100/month. It felt like shouting into an empty room. 💀



I’d spent endless hours crafting threads, trying to go viral, engaging with the usual ""build in public"" crowd. Crickets. Or worse, just other founders trying to promote their own stuff.



My first two months, from June and July, were brutal. Barely broke \*\*$100 combined\*\* across both apps. I was tracking every penny, and it felt like I was just burning time and energy.



Then, out of sheer frustration, I decided to shift gears completely. I started genuinely engaging on Reddit. Not just my own subs, but relevant communities where my target users actually hung out and talked about their problems.



Instead of overtly promoting, I focused on helping. Answering questions, sharing real insights based on my experience, and occasionally, very subtly, mentioning one of my projects if it was directly relevant to a solution someone was seeking. The change was immediate. 🚀



Since September, my revenue has climbed steadily. This month (November), I'm projected to hit \*\*$400 this month\*\* across my two SaaS projects. It's not unicorn money, but going from barely $100/month to $1.2k in just a few months feels like a massive win for a solo builder juggling two things. 💪



\*\*Here's what I learned:\*\*



\*   \*\*Go where your users are actually talking.\*\* Don't chase vanity metrics on platforms full of other founders. Find where your target audience \*complains\* or \*asks for help\*.

\*   \*\*Give value, don't just promote.\*\* Be a peer, not a marketer. Solve problems for people, and they'll naturally be curious about what you build.

\*   \*\*Be patient.\*\* Reddit isn't instant virality, but it builds genuine, high-quality interest and trust over time.

\*   \*\*Don't be afraid to pivot your marketing strategy.\*\* What works for one person won't work for everyone. Be flexible and test different channels.

\*   \*\*Juggling multiple projects is possible\*\*, but focus your marketing efforts. One strong channel is better than five weak ones.



I'm still figuring out most of this, but the shift from X to Reddit was a game-changer for me.



Anyone else had a similar experience with different platforms? What's been your secret sauce for getting initial traction?



Happy to answer questions about my journey or the types of subreddits I found most effective.

You have 60 seconds to perform a **Tactical Environment Assessment**.

Do not move. Just use your eyes. Scan the room you are currently in and identify the following three assets. Do it fast. The scenario is live.

**1. The Zombie Defense Asset**
Look to your immediate left. Within a six-foot radius, identify the single object you would grab if a slow-moving zombie walked through the door right now.
*   Is it a lamp? A heavy book? A lukewarm cup of coffee?
*   Assess its weight. Visualize the swing. Is it durable enough? Decide now.

**2. The Barricade**
Scan the furniture. If you had to block the door in 10 seconds, which object is the ""Anchor""?
*   The couch? The dresser? A pile of laundry?
*   Calculate the drag coefficient. Is it too heavy to move alone? Or just heavy enough to hold the line? Make the call.

**3. The ""MacGyver"" Item**
Scan the small objects on shelves or tables. Find the one item that looks useless but could save the day in a weirdly specific situation.
*   A paperclip? A rubber band? A stale cracker?
*   Don't ask why you need it. Just locate it. Secure the visual.

**ASSESSMENT COMPLETE.**

Perimeter is scanned. Assets are identified. You are tactically prepared for a zombie apocalypse in a living room.

For context, my cousin has always shown signs of OCD from a young age including getting upset when her food would touch on her plate and refusing to eat it. She grew up around adults that also had OCD and were germophobic but her mother does not have this. She also was heavily spoiled as a child but grew out of it when she got older and the relatives spoiling her were ex-communicated from the family over siding with a not-good person on their side. When she was a teenager, her mom began dating a man that also had OCD and was germophobic. They moved in to his house that he owned. Side note, I have nothing against OCD or germophobia as I work with adults with disabilities and know how it can be. for them. Well, her stepdad got laid off from his job and had to relocate to another state. He said my cousin could rent the house if she found another roommate. My boyfriend and I had lived with roommates before but found ourselves back at my mom’s house in a cramped room. We were desperate to get out again and thought we might move in with my cousin. How my cousin can be was definitely a consideration for us but she had seemed to be more down-to-Earth as she grew up and we were unaware of the extent of it when she was at home. There were so many rules put in place for us as soon as we moved in, including recycling everything we possibly could and washing it out, throughly cleaning the washer and dryer every time we used it, only using the dishwasher as a drying rack for dishes that we were supposed to hand wash, etc. Some things, such as the recycling, we had never done before and we explained it would probably take some getting used to. She said she figured and would “go easy on us.” When we moved our things in, anything I tried to put in the kitchen was immediately moved around behind us and put where she wanted it to be. It was a shock for us as we were renting too and knew from prior experiences that roommates needed to share common spaces and compromise as to not be too controlling. I am more laid back and non-confrontational so I decided to leave it alone for the time being. For the first week straight, we then got constant passive-aggressive texts reminding us to do things “the correct way.” We would be upset but would do them anyway the way she asked as I knew how important the house being super clean meant to her. Her mom came to visit one day and warned us herself that she “can be a little ‘clean’” and that we should just “ignore her” when she gets in her moods. She stopped texting everyday, but there would still be a couple texts here and there reminding us of things. My boyfriend and I also both have ADD and can be forgetful on remembering things which is why the reminders every so often were okay. Eventually it got to a point where the reminders would get more aggressive and annoying when it was just a simple mistake that could have easily been fixed by her or something that my bf and I both knew that we were already doing. On one day, she texted us saying that we needed to remember to clean the washer and dryer as there was mold starting to grow on the rubber rim and she couldn’t stand mold. I had enough and explained that we had been doing it the exact way she wanted so it must be something with the washer itself. She said she “knew that we were doing it but she just wanted to remind us anyway.” A few weeks later, I left Tupperware containers that I borrowed from my mom out on the counter to remember to take them back to her when I went later. We were in our room when we heard her return from work and go “Are you fucking kidding me?! Put these in the cabinet where they belong, goddamn.” before slamming them in the cabinets and storming to her room. This leads me to today where I came home from work and there were post-it notes on the washer, dryer, coffee machine, and a few other places. The notes were reminders to clean out the washer and dryer (that we hadn’t used in a few days and throughly inspected after doing so) as well as taking the K-cup pod out of the coffee machine when done. My boyfriend uses the coffee machine more than anyone and always remembers to take the K-cup out but forgot to this one morning. I am so infuriated and don’t know what to do. I can’t really move back home and have no where else to go as of right now but I can’t keep doing this with her. She’s never had a roommate before and it definitely shows but she flips a switch in an instant and seems to have an attitude out of the blue. I don’t want to ruin our relationship but I might lose my mind if I continue to be reminded to do things that I already do. I guess I’m also asking for any advice on what to do in this situation as well or if I should just try to ignore it like my aunt says to.

(Side note: She also does things that make no sense to me such as leaving food sit out on the counter all night that she doesn’t want to take out to the woods. We also can’t put any food in the trash, it all has to be dumped out in the woods so we “don’t attract bugs.”)",7,1763497344.0,badroommates,3,0.9,False

# The Lead:

Last week, global trade policy saw several notable shifts. India pushed to expand imports and negotiate with the US, while the United States adjusted its tariff regime, reducing duties on certain Chinese chemical imports and rolling back tariffs on key agricultural goods (such as coffee, beef and cocoa) to ease input-cost pressures. Meanwhile, trade negotiations with Switzerland moved toward a tariff-reduction agreement. The changes in US policy had immediate ripple effects: Brazil’s coffee exports are disadvantaged by the US exclusion, and both Japan and Switzerland flagged economic contraction tied to US tariff impacts on exports. Overall, the developments reflect a dynamic environment where trade-policy levers are being actively used both for domestic cost relief and for negotiating trade architecture abroad.

# This Week’s Ocean, Air & Freight Markets

**China-US Ocean Freight Market:**

China Export Area (CEA) to US West Coast (USWC) and US East Coast (USEC) spot rates have fallen sharply this week after several successive reductions from carriers.

CEA to USWC: Rates have dropped multiple times in recent weeks and are now roughly in the $1,400–$1,600/FEU range, essentially unwinding much of the early Q4 increases.

CEA to USEC: Rates sit around $2,300/FEU, with the traditional premium over the West Coast narrowing to about $700 versus the usual $800–$900 spread, reflecting especially weak demand to the East Coast.

Overall, both lanes are seeing “very fast” rate erosion, with East Coast pricing under even more pressure than the West Coast.

**This Week Explained:**

* **Faster-than-expected post-peak correction:** Rates have been cut “four or five times already,” dropping back to levels seen before the last two GRIs, indicating carriers have quickly walked back early-November increases.
* **No effective rate-holding mechanism:** With little in the way of firm GRIs or capacity controls sticking, the market is in “free flow”, allowing rates to slide as carriers chase limited cargo.
* **Seasonal demand slowdown & holiday focus:** We are firmly in the off-peak window; shippers are focused on holidays rather than new orders, and factories in Asia are approaching seasonal slow periods, reducing bookings out of CEA.
* **Tariff reduction impact has been muted:** The recently announced 10% reduction in some U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods has not translated into a noticeable uptick in exports yet, likely because it coincides with a traditionally slow season.
* **Aggressive carrier and forwarder competition:** Large forwarders are receiving lower fixed rates from carriers as carriers push for volume. Those large players then sell near-cost to smaller forwarders, who in turn quote customers at or below their own cost just to hold onto accounts. Chinese forwarders in particular are pressuring U.S. forwarders with very low offers.
* **East Coast demand is especially weak:** We see “pretty dead” volume to the East Coast, which is why the USEC premium over USWC has compressed to roughly $700. Carriers are actively hunting for USEC volume, keeping those rates under heavier pressure.
* **Capacity and space are no longer an issue:** Recent West Coast hiccups, including some rolling two weeks ago, have abated as carriers have put vessels back into rotation. There is now plenty of space on both coasts, removing any short-term support for rate levels.
* **Industry strain, but not collapse:** While rate competition is intense and some forwarders are in “more inconsistent” or vulnerable positions, widespread closures are not seen; more so downsizing rather than shutting doors.

**Looking Ahead:**

With about a week and a half left in November, we're not expecting rates to rise again before month-end, despite carriers’ tendency to try increases wherever possible. For December, base case is the same or slightly lower rates, not higher, given very weak shipment activity and upcoming international holidays and factory closures in Asia.

Carriers are expected to push for a rate rebound in January, either by implementing increases at the start of the month or by pre-loading GRIs in the second half of December to build momentum heading into Q1.

As long as East Coast demand remains weaker and cargo continues to favor the West Coast, we're expecting the USEC premium to remain compressed. The USWC may find a floor sooner if volumes there stabilize, while USEC rates could continue to lag.

With big forwarders, smaller forwarders, and China-based players all fighting for share, below-cost quoting is likely to persist in the near term. Unless carriers meaningfully pull capacity or successfully enforce GRIs, the market will remain highly price-competitive through December.

Space and schedule reliability remain strong, but ongoing rate pressure is squeezing forwarder margins, which could lead to selective downsizing and consolidation if the low-rate environment continues into early 2026.  
  


**China-US Air Freight Market:**

Air freight rates from China to the U.S. continue to climb as we move deeper into the traditional peak season. Among all major U.S. gateways, China to JFK remains the highest-priced lane, reflecting strong demand, tight capacity, and carriers’ continued attempts to push rates upward ahead of year-end.

PVG to JFK spot rates remain elevated across all weight breaks.  
Premium carriers (e.g., CK, UA) show little to no discounting even at higher chargeable weights.  
Space availability continues tightening, particularly for e-commerce-heavy eastbound flows.



**This Week Explained:**

* **Peak Season Demand:** Q4 promotions and holiday shipments are driving increased export volume.
* **E-commerce Surge:** Strong order flows (especially post-Singles Day) are boosting demand for fast airport-to-door solutions.
* **Capacity Constraints:** Passenger flight belly space has not fully recovered, leaving freighter capacity in high demand.
* **Carrier Pricing Strategy:** Airlines continue raising rates to secure favorable 2026 BSA negotiations.
* **Lane Imbalances:** JFK’s congestion, longer transit times, and higher demand keep pricing above other U.S. destinations.



**Looking Ahead:**

Expect rates to remain **firm or increase further** through late November into early December. Unless demand sharply weakens, carriers are positioned to maintain elevated levels.  
  
For the next two weeks, rates likely **hold or rise**, especially on JFK and LAX lanes as online retailers push last-mile order deadlines.  
  
After 3 weeks until end of December, airlines may continue tightening space allocations to maintain rate strength into early 2026 contract talks.

My wife has been diagnosed as BP2 a few years ago. She has always struggled with depression, but this diagnosis fits reality a bit better. She started on lithium in addition to her SSRIs back then and things have gotten a bit more stable because the (hypo)manic episodes have gotten less pointy. I can sometimes reach her again, which feels like an improvement.

There is also a negative change. She's started drinking. She never really drank more than maybe a bottle of wine per month and has gotten to the point where she easily drinks 12-18 units per day. We've been talking about it a lot and because she has also put herself in danger at times we agreed that it's better if she tries not to drink. But it's clearly eating her up, alcohol is all she can think about and she will find a way to drink in secret whenever she gets a chance. She tries to hide it, so she'll start early and then try to sober up before I'm back but this obviously doesn't fool me.

Still, I've heard stories about people with BP that absolutely scare me and I'm very happy that I haven't had to deal with anything like that. She's smart, funny, truly loves me, we've been together for 20 years and I am thankful for those 20 years.

Thing is, it's not easy to me. I have a demanding job, and when I get home it occasionally feels like my 2nd job starts. When she's depressed a lot lands on me because she's functioning at low capacity. So I'm cooking 7 days per week, doing most of the housekeeping, walking the dogs, do all the grocery shopping, etc. I bring her food and coffee, and sometimes deal with chores related to her hobbies or work. When she's (hypo)manic I am struggling to keep up with her impulsive thoughts, cleaning up after her, trying to slow her down when possible. Like I said, she's intelligent so when I *can* reach her we can talk about it and she understands why I sometimes overstep and tell her not to do something she really wants to do. She's empathetic when we talk about it but also forgets those conversations really easily, it seems.

I know I am doing more than can be expected from me, but I love her and lovingly do all of it for her. And I honestly don't feel like I have it bad when I compare it with how she's feeling.

But some nights, like tonight, I struggle. She's been talking about disappearing again more recently. I know alcohol is a risk when these thoughts are there so I challenge her desire for alcohol and try to help her realize that alcohol is not helping, but it's difficult to convince her to leave the alcohol. The lies about drinking and certain behaviors are also difficult for me. I feel like I'm slowly fading away and am really starting to lose hope.

Are there people who have seen significant improvement towards a more stable life, where the episodes are less deep and further apart, like her doctor keeps telling us? Is there a life to look forward to? Or am I ultimately going to need to brace myself for losing the love of my life?",5,1763496848.0,BipolarSOs,1,1.0,False
