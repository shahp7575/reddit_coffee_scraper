By Edward Panzarella


    I was born and raised in New York City, The Home of Broadway, the financial center, The Mets and The Yankees, and the 911 memorial. Our police and firefighters are among the bravest in the world, There is however one New York municipality that is taken for granted, that is the NYC Dept. of Sanitation. A mistake I will never make again.
Twice a week I place my garbage curbside,  like every other New Yorker, and like clockwork the garbage disappears, never giving it a second thought.
      On Friday, the building where I worked lost power. With no other choice, my boss give us the rest of the day off.
     I was excited by this news, all I could think of was grabbing my surfboard and hitting the beach before anyone else,  getting a head start on the weekend. I got out of there as quick as I could, jumped in my car and sped off.
     The whole way home all I could think about was having the beach all to myself. That's when I made the mistake of turning down a long narrow block with a sanitation truck on it.
The sanitation workers were hard at work, moving the truck up to every house, removing the garbage that was at the curb, and doing it again.
I tried to be patient, but seconds seemed like hours. All I could think of,  was the day slowly ticking away, and losing that alone time on the beach.
So I did what any New Yorker would do, I leaned on my horn. The workers did their best to ignore me and continue doing their job. After a minute or so, one of the sanitation workers finally approached me.
“ Excuse me, but could you please stop blowing your horn,  We're moving as fast as we can. We'll get out of your way just as soon as possible,  just be patient”.
       That answer only seemed to grate on my nerves. So again I responded like a New Yorker and flipped him the bird. The sanitation worker ignored this and went back to work. Finally in what seemed like forever, we got to the end of the block and the truck turned off the street and I was able to get home.
I pulled into the drive way, grabbed my surfboard and headed to the beach. I caught a couple of waves but I couldn't seem to get my mind off of those sanitation workers. After a couple of hours people started to show up, so I packed it in, realizing that no matter what I did I wasn’t going to be able to enjoy the day.
      When I returned home, I parked my car, put away my surfboard, went into the house, sat on the couch and turned on the tv.
Next thing I know it was morning, I must have fallen asleep. I stumbled into the kitchen to make myself a cup of coffee. Then I heard it, the sound of a garbage truck going up the block and I realized I forgot to take out the trash. A sense of panic went threw me, thinking that I would have to have the garbage on the side of my house for for another few days. I grabbed the garbage from the kitchen, ran out the back door grabbing the pail in the driveway rushing to the curb.
     When I got there the truck was nowhere in sight.  After what happened yesterday, I was not going to deal with this, they owe me for ruining my day, so I called 311 complaining that the truck drove by my house and didn’t pick up my garbage.
Later that day an official sanitation car pulled up and a man in a green uniform with a badge on his shirt got out walked up to my pail inspected it, then went to the front door and rang my bell.
“Hello sir, I’m supervisor Jacks from New York City sanitation, I am here about the 311 complaint you made.”
       I replied “Thank you for coming. It seems that the sanitation workers picked up everyone else’s garbage but mine.”
The supervisor said “I looked at the way you put your garbage out, there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong. I don’t know why the crew left it. When did you put it out?”
     I told him “I put it out last night.”
The supervisor looked puzzled and again said “I don’t understand why.”
     I  exclaimed “ I’ll tell you why, this is because yesterday I found myself behind one of your trucks. I was in a hurry, I got a call from my mother, she had an accident. I was rushing to the hospital to see her. I beeped at the workers to get their attention, and explain this. One of the workers give me the finger and they purposely started working slower. Now they are refusing to pick up my garbage!”
      Yes I lied, but I wasn’t about to let those self important civil servant’s get the better of me. They ruined my day at the beach, now it’s pay back.
The supervisor said “I apologize for their behavior. I will look into this. I will get your garbage picked up. I  hope everything is ok with your mother.”
He said all the right things, but I was on a roll  “I pay my taxes and I deserve service. These uneducated morons better learn how to do there job.”
That's where he interrupted me “Sir I appreciate your situation, but I have to tell you the men and women of the sanitation department work hard to keep this city clean and disease free.”
I replied “Disease free, suddenly they’re all doctors please.”
      The supervisor in a sharper voice said “Again I am sorry for how you were treated, I will get this sorted out, I will tell you this, if there comes a day where those trucks stop rolling, the city will be in serious trouble. Now you have a good day sir.”
True to his word, at some point during the night the garbage was picked up, bottom line treatedI thought to myself serious trouble, I’m sure the world would be just fine.
      The following week I put out my garbage as usual, but when I came home from work, I found the my garbage thrown about my front hallway, I was furious at this site.
      I don’t know how they got into my house, but this was obviously pay back. I called 311 again and blasted the operator, screaming and yelling how the sanitation workers broke into my house and threw garbage all over.
Again the same official car pulled up and the same officer got out. This time I was standing outside waiting for him. When he walked over to me I hit him with a barrage of profanity telling him how the sanitation workers came into my house and threw garbage all around.
He said to me “ Calm down, now explain what happened?”
      I told him”  The sanitation workers took the garbage that I had at the curb, somehow got into my house and scattered it throughout my hallway.”
The supervisor said” Those are serious charges,  I don't believe that the sanitation workers would do that. Do you have any proof?”
Yelling at the top of my lungs” You can't believe they would do this, who else would it be? They're just getting even for the other day.”
He asked me if I had cameras on the property.
I told him I have a video doorbell.
He said again ""those are serious charges, do you mind if I look at the video to see who it was?”
I agreed, thinking who else could it be, I figuring I had them dead to rights.
      I pulled up the video on my phone, we both watched, what we saw was my garbage sitting at the curb a few minutes go by, then the sanitation truck comes in to view, slowly pull up the sanitation worker picks up my garbage throws it into the truck and drives to the next stop.  I was shocked, I couldn't understand what happened, but there it, was on video it wasn't the sanitation workers.
The supervisor said to me” Sir I don't know what to tell you, nor do I know who did this. I can tell you that it wasn't the sanitation, workers so I suggest you call the police.”
      So that's what I did. The police came by went over the video, not finding anything obvious, they asked me some questions. Then made a report and left.
      The next couple of weeks went by without incident, so I thought. I put my garbage out and the next day it was gone.
I then started to notice a rancid rotting smell. I searched my house, and couldn't find anything, until I opened the basement door. The smell was so bad I immediately vomited. There was garbage piled up in the basement. I was bewildered at this discovery. Who was doing this? Since it wasn’t the sanitation workers, I was at a loss. I checked the video for the past week and found nothing. All I know is that I have all this garbage in my basement, and no idea how to get to get rid of it.
       I went to the hardware store, and bought industrial size garbage bags and good pair of gloves. I went back to my house and down to the basement and began to clean up the mess.
I had to take time off from work, it took 2 days and a 20 yard dumpster, but I finally got all the garbage out of the basement.
     The next day I woke up to that same rancid odor. There was a swarm of flies surrounding and biting me,  I jumped up and ran out of the bedroom. And straight to the bathroom,  I could still smell that horrific odor and I started to wretch.  I jumped in the shower and washed over and over again, trying to get rid of the smell.  No matter how hard I tried I could still smell the garbage. I got out of the shower and went downstairs, what I saw filled me with dread. I found that not just the basement but the entire house filled with garbage. 
     There were maggots all over the countertops, rats running wild, along with roaches.  The amount of flys and mosquitoes were unbelievable.
I was engulfed by the creatures.  Flies and mosquitoes were biting me everywhere. The swarm was so thick that when I looked down at my hands all I could see was a writhing mass of insects.
My hair was starting to fall out. I began coughing, sores and boils were starting to cover my entire body. I started to vomit, all that came out was a mixture of blood and bile.
      I tried to make it to the door for help, but before I could get there, I collapsed. I barely had the strength to move. I slowly dragged myself to a window thinking I would call out for help. I didn't have the strength to open it. I could only stare out the window hoping someone would see me.
Days later I watched as a sanitation car pulled up to the house,  a supervisor gets out and was greeted by my neighbor. I could just make out what was being said.
     I heard my neighbor ” Are you here about the 311 complaint”
The supervisor answered “Yes, I’m Supervisor Jacks, How can I help you?”The neighbor replied” this use to be a nice house, for some reason the owner must have abandoned it. There is nothing here now but garbage, rodents, and flies, It's a breeding ground for all kinds of diseases, is there anything you can do?”
     The supervisor answered “I can write some summons's, and I'll get in touch with the board of health and we'll try to get this cleaned up for you""  the supervisor add “some people just don't seem to understand how important good sanitation is.”
I just closed my eyes.

Ah, Austria’s national team—back in the World Cup after a 28-year nap, dreaming of glory and maybe a coffee chug to wake up. Their group? A delightful cocktail of *Argentina*, *Algeria*, and *Jordan*. David Alaba, the captain, bravely admitted Argentina is “the most difficult opponent” (shocking, given they’ve got Messi, who’s basically a footballing god with a passport). Algeria? “Very strong” (sure, who isn’t when you’re not Spain or Portugal?). And Jordan? Well, they “earned their spot,” which is code for “don’t sleep on the underdogs… or maybe just do sleep, but not here.”  

Austria’s response? *Confidence*. Because why not? They’ve got Ralf Rangnick, the tactical wizard who turned them into a “compact, aggressive, and disciplined” team—read: they’ll probably tackle you before you blink. Rangnick, the guy who made “gegenpressing” sound like a dance move, has built a squad that’s “intense” and “structured,” which is just a fancy way of saying they won’t lose 7-0 to Romania (probably).  

Oh, and they’re *excited* to face Argentina. Player Fisa called it a “dream” and referenced the 1978 “Miracle of Córdoba,” where Austria beat West Germany. Let’s hope this miracle includes a time machine to let them replay that moment over and over.  

The group stage? A gauntlet. But Austria’s all in, thanks to Red Bull’s Salzburg money-laundering… uh, *investments*. They’re a “quietly matured, long-term project,” which is just a euphemism for “we’re not here by accident, bro.”  

And the draw? Hosted by Heidi Klum and Kevin Hart, because nothing says “serious football” like a celebrity circus. The Austrian delegation is probably sweating through their suits, trying to pick a group that doesn’t involve Brazil or France. Rangnick’s ideal? A host nation (USA, Canada, or Mexico) because, as he said, “they’ll be distracted by their own parties.” Fair.  

In the end, Austria’s goal is simple: don’t embarrass themselves. With a team that’s “organized, intense, and individually strong,” they’ll aim to advance—though facing Argentina might require a Hail Mary and a prayer to the footballing gods.  

**Verdict:** Austria’s World Cup journey is either a heroic underdog story or a cautionary tale about overconfidence. Either way, it’s going to be a rollercoaster. Buckle up.",1,1764993938.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

Ah, another day in football, where the drama off the pitch often outshines the chaos on it. Let’s dive into the *highlight reel* of December 5, 2025, where Ligue 1 lineups, transfer rumors, and a Turkish betting scandal that makes *Game of Thrones* look tame take center stage.  

**European Football: A Masterclass in Overcomplicating Things**  
- **Ligue 1** is serving up a smorgasbord of drama: Lille vs. Marseille (because nothing says “friendly rivalry” like eye-gouging), Brest vs. Monaco (because why not?), and Rennes’ Beye preparing to face PSG like it’s a *gladiatorial match*. Meanwhile, Lens is hopelessly dreaming of national team call-ups—*good luck, buddy*.  
- **Marseille’s Rulli** is getting a standing ovation from coach De Zerbi for *not spilling coffee on the pitch*, while PSG’s Luis Enrique is busy roasting Beye’s performance like a Thanksgiving turkey.  
- **Transfer chaos** reigns: Barça might finally pay Raphinha’s release clause (because why not?), Arsenal’s Arteta is plotting like a Bond villain, and Strasbourg is eyeing an Ecuadorian attacker—*because every team needs a “mystery man” to explain losses*.  
- **Saudi clubs** are reportedly circling Salah like vultures, but Liverpool’s Slot is playing it cool: “Salah’s our golden goose. No way we’re letting him tweet in Arabic for someone else.”  

**Turkish Football: A Soap Opera With More Plot Twists Than a Telenovela**  
Oh, Turkey, you’ve outdone yourself. The *second wave* of the betting scandal is here, and it’s like a Russian nesting doll of corruption:  
- **27 players** (including Yandaş, Baltacı, and Malkoçoğlu) are facing *lifetime bans* for betting on their own matches. Because nothing says “team loyalty” like gambling against your own squad.  
- **Clubs like Adana Demirspor and Antalyaspor** are on the brink of relegation and 12-point deductions—*all because their players thought they were playing Monopoly*.  
- **Referee Zorbay Küçük** and ex-president Murat Sancak are in custody, and the TFF is finally ditching its “light slap on the wrist” policy for *harsher penalties*. Welcome to the era of “bet on your team, get a lifetime of regret.”  
- **Manisa Futbol Kulübü** joins the party, with four players detained and contracts likely terminated. Because nothing says “team-building” like unilateral contract breaks and arrests.  
- **35 suspects total** are in custody, and journalist Tahir Kum is *thrilled* the scandal might involve match-fixing. “This is the biggest scandal since someone decided to put a goat on a football field!”  

**The Verdict**  
Football in 2025 is less about skill and more about *who’s getting arrested next*. While European clubs bicker over transfers and lineups, Turkey’s football scene is serving up a side of judicial drama that even Shakespeare would call “a tragedy in five acts.”  

In the end, the only thing more unpredictable than match outcomes is whether players will bet on their own teams or just bet on their own sanity. *Welcome to football, where the real game is always off the field.* 🏆⚖️",1,1764993878.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

1pffr7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1pffr7n/vyvanse_and_chestheart_pain/,Vyvanse and chest/heart pain,"I, (18F), started vyvanse around 5 months ago.

I am completely healthy heart wise (as far as I know). I got an x-ray of my lungs a few months ago and they are healthy.

I was first on 10mg of vyvanse. This didn’t do much and it was increased to 20mg. About a week in, I started experiencing a very uncomfortable feeling.

I can’t describe it that well, but it’s definitely chest/heart related. It feels like a balloon is sitting inside my chest and there’s pressure. This pressure only happens on the left or right side, BUT it flips and I experience the feeling on both sides. I do not drink high amounts of caffeine, only green tea in the morning occasionally, never coffee or energy drinks.

Sometimes it lasts 5 minutes, sometimes 30, sometimes hours. It’s not painful, it’s just uncomfortable and I’m very aware if that makes sense.

Last Sunday I finally went to ER (after having this symptom for 3 weeks). I finally realized it was from my adhd medication on Sunday because I had surgery and stopped taking my med for a week. I experienced no chest pain when I wasn’t taking my med. When I finally took my medication again, I made the mistake of drinking coffee with it and the pressure was insane. The uncomfy feeling was trippled, so I called my psychiatrist and she told me to head to ER.

They did an EKG, chest/heart x-ray, and ruled out any dangerous, life threatening issues. Nothing was wrong with me.

I stopped my medication and about a week later I was started on Concerta ER 18mg tablets. I take it once a day early in the morning. Today was my second dose, and the pain is back. Psych doc said it’s less harsh on the chest/adrenaline system and I definitely agree, I’m a lot calmer, but man this sucks.

I have finals on Monday and I need to take it this weekend so I can study, but what the hell do I do?

ADHD medication has saved my mental health. I barely graduated high school and was riddled with lack of focus and motivation to do anything. I genuinely feel normal now. Stopping medication scares me. For years and years I tried different antidepressants and nothing worked. I was finally diagnosed and my life did a complete 180. The main causes of my depression were environment and lack of motivation.

If I still have chest pain in the next few days, what should be my next step? I’ll definitely call my psychiatrist and inform them of my symptoms, but could I have some sort of condition, or problem, and not know?

I’m definitely getting a referral to a cardiologist, but I genuinely have no idea what’s wrong. ER doctor said it might be some sort of friction or rubbing creating a pressure sensation but he obviously wouldn’t know for sure.

Is this feeling normal for some people, and some just can’t tolerate medication? Is it too much on my nervous system?

For every bug we find,

For every bug we fix,

We’re chasing down the gremlins

In this beautiful abyss.

Late nights and coffee stains,

Logs lighting up the screen,

We turn the chaos into code

That runs smooth and clean.

Through crashes that won’t quit,

And the backend starts to cry,

We breathe, we trace, we test again,

And we don’t ask why.

You bring the calm, I bring the grit,

We’re stubborn, smart, and quick—

Two humans versus entropy,

And we’re holding the line.



**Bridge**

And if production lights up red,

We won’t fold, we won’t flinch,

We’ll patch it up together

By the morning’s first hint.

Ah, another day in the beautiful game, where nothing makes sense, everyone’s a drama queen, and the only thing more chaotic than the transfers is the weather. Let’s dive into the madness:  

**Ligue 1: A Soap Opera in Sneakers**  
- Lille vs. Marseille and Brest vs. Monaco: Lineups are as predictable as a cat falling off a roof—*chaos*. Rennes’ Beye gets a chance to redeem himself against PSG, though he’ll need a miracle and maybe a time machine to forget his last performance.  
- Marseille’s goalkeeper Rulli is getting praised by coach De Zerbi like he’s the second coming of Courtois. Meanwhile, PSG’s Luis Enrique is playing “praise and roast” with his squad: *“Great job, everyone… except you, Beye. You looked like a deflated balloon.”*  
- Transfer rumors are thicker than Marseille’s defense. PSG wants Beraldo? Barça might release Raphinha? Strasbourg’s chasing an Ecuadorian striker? It’s like a *Love Island* episode where everyone’s a midfielder.  

**Off-Field Shenanigans: Because Drama Doesn’t Take a Break**  
- Lyon’s owner Textor is feuding with the DNCG, Turkish authorities are rounding up 29 players like they’re casting a dystopian film, and Nazillispor’s stadium is closed because the concrete’s “emotionally unstable.” Plus, their president got detained for match-fixing—*how quaint*.  
- Saudi clubs want Salah? Sure, why not. He’ll probably end up in a desert doing TikToks. And Bordeaux’s matches will be on Ligue 1+—*because nothing says “luxury” like streaming to 7 people*.  

**EFL: The “Who’s the Real Manager Here?” Show**  
- Coventry City is leading the Championship, but can they handle the pressure? Ipswich Town’s inconsistency is like a broken metronome. Leicester’s points deduction drama? *Chef’s kiss*.  
- Birmingham and Southampton are rising like bread in a hot oven, while Millwall’s 97th-minute wins are becoming a *“Here We Go!”* anthem. And the FA Cup’s eliminated teams? They’re playing like it’s *Survivor*: “You’re not you’re not you’re not!”  

**Chelsea’s Buonanotte: The Benchwarmer’s Benchwarmers**  
- Facundo Buonanotte hasn’t played since November 5 because “key players are fit now.” Translation: *“We’re keeping you on ice until January. Enjoy the training ground, kid.”* He’ll probably start against Cardiff or Atalanta—*if the coffee’s strong enough*.  

**And Finally…**  
- PSG’s Luis Enrique dodges questions about transfers like a chess grandmaster. Barça extends Eric García’s contract—*because nothing says “stability” like a 5-year deal for a guy who’s never scored a goal*.  

In conclusion, football in 2025 is a circus, and we’re all paying for front-row seats. Buckle up—next week’s headlines will probably involve a goat scoring a hat-trick or a referee retiring mid-match. *Stay classy, sports world.* 🤷♂️⚽",1,1764993561.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

1pffnt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingBetterMen/comments/1pffnt6/from_instant_gratification_to_delayed_power_why/,From instant gratification to delayed power: why self-control is hotter than hustle now,"It’s wild how obsessed we’ve become with instant rewards. Scroll for 10 seconds, get a dopamine hit. Order food, it’s at your door in 30 minutes. Watch a 7-second video titled “How to get rich FAST.” We’re living in a world that rewired our brains to expect everything now. And it’s not just you. It’s all of us.

What’s worse is that most of the advice we hear online comes from influencers who barely understand neuroscience. They pitch “grindset” culture, quitting your job to trade crypto, or “manifesting” your goals, no nuance, no depth. So many people are left feeling broken for not succeeding instantly. But resisting quick rewards and learning to delay gratification is not only a superpower, it's the foundation for long-term success and peace.

This post is a deep dive into the science and smarter tools behind delayed gratification, self-mastery, and habit-building. Pulled from real research, bestselling books, and top-tier podcasts, not random TikTok bros trying to go viral.

Here’s what actually works:

- **Understand how your brain traps you in “now” mode**
  - Your brain’s reward system, especially the dopamine loop, evolved to prioritize short-term wins. According to Stanford neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman, dopamine isn’t about pleasure, it’s about motivation. And the problem? TikTok, sugar, and fast content hijack this drive system without giving us meaningful reward. (Source: Huberman Lab Podcast “Controlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction”)
  - Studies from MIT (Loewenstein & Prelec, 1992) showed that our brain discounts future rewards irrationally. That’s why saving money or sticking to a diet feels impossible compared to binging a show or buying something now.

- **Long-term rewards activate a deeper system of fulfillment**
  - According to Dr. Gabor Maté, delayed gratification is key to psychological resilience. When we delay pleasure, we give space for intention, reflection, and focus to emerge. This aligns with findings from the famous Stanford marshmallow experiment which showed kids who resisted immediate treats had better life outcomes decades later.
  - But this isn't about willpower alone. It’s about structuring your environment to favor long-term wins.

- **Design friction into your life to prevent impulse behavior**
  - Want to stop late-night doom scrolling? Don’t rely on self-control. Make it harder. Use apps like *Freedom* to block addictive sites or place your phone in another room. James Clear in *Atomic Habits* calls this “environment design” change what’s around you and your decisions will follow.
  - A study from University of Pennsylvania showed that adding small amounts of friction (like logging into a second account) can reduce impulsive online behaviors by over 25%.

- **Build micro-delays for giant wins**
  - Set 10-minute timers before acting on a craving. Start by saying, “I’ll wait 5 more minutes,” then reevaluate. Most urges only last about 15–20 minutes. Learning to ride that wave is a game changer.
  - Use the “temptation bundle” trick from behavioral economist Katy Milkman: pair something you want (watching a show) with something you should do (working out). Over time, this wires your brain to associate discipline with good vibes.

Here are some resources that go *way* deeper into this:

- *Book: “The Willpower Instinct” by Kelly McGonigal*
  - Kelly is a health psychologist at Stanford, and this book is based on one of Stanford’s most popular classes ever. She breaks down the science of self-control into real-world strategies. Bonus: it doesn’t shame you for slipping. You’ll understand why your brain resists and how to actually work with it.
  - This book will make you question everything you think you know about motivation. If you struggle with habits, this is the best self-discipline book I’ve ever read. Life-changing read.

- *Book: “Atomic Habits” by James Clear*
  - Still the gold standard in habit change. Instead of motivation, it focuses on identity and environment. It’s everywhere for a reason. It works. Clear’s framework of cue-craving-response-reward explains why good habits stick and bad ones linger. Thousands of people have restructured their lives with it.
  - If you’re overwhelmed by big goals, this book teaches you to focus on 1% improvements daily. It’s not hype. It’s real behavior science.

- *Podcast: “The Tim Ferriss Show” episode with Maya Shankar*
  - Maya is a cognitive scientist who worked in the Obama White House. This episode dives into the psychology of behavior change and how small shifts in language and context shape long-term habits.
  - Great insights on replacing outcomes with identities. Instead of “I want to go to the gym,” it becomes “I’m the kind of person who trains regularly.” Powerfully reframes everything.

- *YouTube: Andrew Huberman’s series on Dopamine*
  - Huberman is a neuroscientist at Stanford and his dopamine episodes are basically a masterclass on the drive-reward system. He explains how to “reset” your relationship with gratification and how novelty addiction damages focus.
  - He also outlines practices like “dopamine fasting” and why even cold showers or delaying coffee can train your brain for deeper motivation.

- *App: BeFreed*
  - As an adult with ADHD, reading was always a struggle. Since grad school, I probably finished 1 or 2 books a year max. Then a friend at Columbia recommended *BeFreed*, a smart audio learning app. You just tell it what you want to work on (like “how to stop craving dopamine hits” or “becoming more mentally resilient”) and it builds personalized podcast-style audio lessons for you.
  - It pulls from top books, psychology studies, TED talks, and expert interviews. The best part? Every lesson adapts to your curiosity. You can pause, ask questions, switch voices, or go for a deep, detailed breakdown with stories and examples. I picked a smooth, funny voice that makes me actually enjoy listening while walking or commuting. It’s like having a personal audio coach.
  - No more jumping between 12 podcasts trying to find what clicks. This app connects the dots for you.

- *App: Finch Journal & Self Care*
  - If you want to delay gratification, you need to track your habits and celebrate the small wins. Finch gives you a cute virtual pet that grows based on your self-care activities. Sounds childish? Maybe. But it works. Logging a morning walk or skipping sugar earns positive feedback loops.
  - It gamifies discipline in a surprisingly wholesome way and helps build daily momentum, especially when you’re mentally drained.

- *App: MasterClass*
  - This one’s more for those who want to *replace* passive content doomscrolling with intentional learning. Watching an hour of fiction turned into watching Chris Voss teach negotiation or Anna Wintour on decision making. It feels productive and luxurious at the same time.

Everything in this post isn’t about being a productivity machine. It’s about reclaiming your attention. If you can train your brain to wait, you win. Because most people can’t. And those who can? They’ll own the next decade.",1,1764993330.0,BuildingBetterMen,0,1.0,False

I am not looking for a short term thing.. fyi. I know this post is long but trust me it’s worth it. 

I am a 57 year old man from California who is looking for someone, a unique someone, a woman, who is smart and kind and with a touch of humor and sarcasm, fun to spend time with and true to herself and true to those around her. Introvert like me is cool but not a deal breaker, My mystery woman enjoys a night in on the couch and a movie, cares about her health and cares for those around her enjoys humor, spontaneous kitchen dancing 💃🕺 We enjoy each others company above all else even if its at the Safeway or doing laundry, we enjoy and appreciate each other and that matters most.. Yeah I might be a bit of a sap too.. FYI 

Interests on my end are varied yet simple, I enjoy travel, mostly roadtrips, cooking and photography, writing and music, films, reading and coffee, long walks and interesting talks and can be found on a nice day off at the beach with my feet in the sand and just enjoying the waves. I am 420 friendly but edibles only as I don’t smoke and rarely drink, aside from the occasional single malt. I am a jeans and t-shirt guy, that owns shirts and ties and even a tux lol but I am at my best with a casual, laid back style and am someone who enjoys a good day at a street fair or just roaming thrift stores or a great garage sale (I always follow those homemade signs and have to pull over to check it out).. Bonus points for sense of humor and especially fans of puns and Dad jokes, transparency is a big thing with me. be straight or please don’t bother. Life is too short and honestly I don’t have the patience for games anymore.  I’m not a sportsball fan, if you are great but I enjoy sports, just don’t follow any teams etc. 

Ok starting to ramble a bit but hang tight!! As far as music goes.. I love music and music to me is scattered and eclectic, I like classic rock, alternative, jazz, R&B, pop, you name it, I can go from AC/DC to Rush, The Who, Stones to Joy Division/New Order, to Miles Davis and Yellowjackets, to Sabbath and Laibach to Beethoven and Mozart and GD to Sanborn, Zevon, DCFC/Postal, Lagwagon, Clean Bandit, Jess Glynn, Vivaldi, Gran Bel Fisher, Rafferty, Genesis, The Moss, Shins, Cake, Sputnik, Killers, Coldplay, Winwood, Segar, Madness, Milkmen, Violent Fems, to The Doors to Zeppelin to Prince to Floyd all in the course of a few hours and I could probably go on but I think you get the idea lol.. Its harder for films as I have way too many favorites, movies and TV is scattered too but as a short example list, Firefly, Eureka, Anything Sorkin, good drama, or comedy.. I have a killer film library on Plex and love to do a film binge or marathon with you.. I’m not much of a horror fan but enjoy a good mystery with a horror angle.. Again, a long list :-)

Singing in the car is a must (yeah I am that whackadoodle you saw at the traffic light recently doing the car karaoke 🤣) and carrying a tune is not mandatory but would be cool if at least one of us in the car could carry one 😜 what is mandatory is my taking your hand and spontaneous dancing in the kitchen or elsewhere. That is a guarantee 💃🕺 

Someone to connect with and continue to grow with, let’s chat and see how we vibe and take things from there, naturally and organically and see what develops.

Location is not a factor but must be USA/Canada based NO exceptions, age is not a factor, It’s all about who you are as a person, and how we mesh together that matters most to me. So your age doesn’t matter, But, I do tend to connect better with those younger than me..

Your reply should tell me about you with A/L/I (Age, Location and Interests), Those with a picture attached gets mine in reply, and physical attraction is somewhat important, and I prefer to get this part over with early on. But who you are is what matters to me most. 

Apologies if I am too blunt or transparent but it’s the way I am, I don’t do games, I don’t ghost, I am a straight shooter and like that about myself. If you are the ghosting type, please scroll. I don’t want that energy, maturity matters more. 

So that’s my post.. if you made it this far, awesome :) send me a chat request and let’s talk. Give me a song that gets you going or a film that you can rewatch or that book or TV show that you have done more than once and will again!! 📚🎶📺💙",1,1764993274.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False
1pffn4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1pffn4t/louis_carrying_fried_chicken_plates/,Louis Carrying Fried Chicken Plates,"

Louis works nights at a bar on the second floor by the station,
stacking up shifts carrying four-hundred-yen fried chicken.

The floor at night is clouded with that same cheap steam.
On the tiles, rings of shochu dry to nothing.
On the tables, little islands of grease are left behind.

Louis walks his name tag
back and forth between the fryer and the tables,
wearing the face of someone who is always running somewhere far away on weekends.

A woman in heavy perfume holds her glass,
the inside of her wrist marked
with a low-rent strip of sunburn that has nothing to do with the scent.
When he sets down the chicken, her fingers trace his name tag
and she says his name out loud.
The private title “that rich-perfume lady”
scrapes once in the back of his throat.

At the next table, a man in a suit grumbles
that the smoke from the fried meat will cling to his jacket.
On the other side,
someone else frowns that the chicken smell will stick to their clothes.
Every time the call bell rings,
the same plate makes another lap, renamed by a different complaint.

In the break room, a hill of cold chicken grows,
with canned coffee and paper cups rolling at the foot of it.
“This place is a zoo of smells.”
“The fryer cage. The perfume cage. The fabric-softener cage.”
Louis laughs, “Yeah, a zoo,”
wearing the face of someone who does not think
his own name tag is one more label on a cage.

“Did you see that perfume woman earlier,
smelling like she bought the whole room.
Even our frying oil looked like her debt.”
Someone says this,
and Louis folds his own voice into the laughter,
as if he were speaking from the safe side of the bars.

A new hire asks, “What do we do if they complain?”
“Easy.”
Louis answers with the same half-joking face.
“We turn the whole thing into a story
about how the new kid dropped the plate once in the kitchen.
The kid drops it, the shop bows, they think, ‘What a decent place,’
and we can slip a few more tickets of chicken through the till.”

Louis pictures that spoken story
travelling straight to the phone line where complaints arrive,
a plate dropped in words and carried all the way to a stranger’s ear.

In some corner of his head,
the housing-complex kitchen is still lit.
His mother stands over the pan, silently frying chicken.
Cheap frozen meat sinks into the oil.
Dinner that never cost four hundred yen keeps hissing on.
Money for Louis’s schooling and a perfect script of insults
make one last loop between his parents,
until only the cracking of oil is left.

“Ordinary people grow old
by pushing smells like this onto someone else,”
Louis says, deliberately sounding like a know-it-all.
Then he remembers he is already standing
at the end of that same line.
His mother’s kitchen and this floor
pull at his clothes with the same weight of oil.

Just before closing, thin threads of laughter
hold back nausea in the alley outside.
Louis takes the first place in the line at the time clock.
Each new stamp on the card
adds one more pair of running feet.

In the morning, the elevator car smells the strongest.
Fried food, perfume, fabric softener, all layered,
filling the box like a dinner served with everyone’s mouth shut.
The air around the cooling chicken back in that old kitchen
and the air in this box
settle toward the same heaviness.

The corner of the notice on the wall
is stained with Louis’s grease,
the same color as the islands on the floor outside.
“Please refrain from heavy fragrances.”
“Food smells may linger.”
The printed words sink slowly
toward the rounded corner.

The sound of the time clock
pushes the line forward by one more step.
With a fast-sounding name still hanging on his chest,
Louis takes that sound as the starting gun
and walks toward the elevator.
Inside the box, he traces his name tag once with a fingertip
and packs yesterday’s insults back down into his throat.

Commentary Poem | Louis Carrying Fried Chicken Plates

In a cheap bar above the station, Louis keeps piling up nights of carrying four-hundred-yen fried chicken. Each plate moves not only food but also the customers’ complaints. The woman in heavy perfume, whom he secretly calls the rich-perfume lady, and the men who worry about smells on their suits all give him material to joke about later. In the back room he teaches the shop’s “method” to the trainee: turn every mistake into a story where the new kid drops a plate, the shop apologizes, and the guest leaves thinking this is a decent place. Tickets on the register increase while the blame is carefully reassigned.

Somewhere underneath that skill, there is the kitchen in the housing block where his mother fried chicken in silence. Cheap frozen meat fell into the oil while money for schooling and rehearsed insults passed between his parents. What stayed in the room in the end was the sound of the oil. The present fryer and that kitchen are tied together by the price of the meat and the thickness of the smell, and Louis half-knows it.

The elevator in the morning is packed with air layered from fried food, perfume and fabric softener. The printed warning about strong fragrances, stained by his own grease, sinks toward its rounded corner. The roles of those who send smells out and those who suffer them blur inside that small box.

Louis shifts complaints onto the trainee’s plate, hides his bad-mouthing in his throat and races to be the first at the time clock. Each stamp adds another unit to his record of running away. How far can someone keep living by passing smell and responsibility onto others. His habit of tracing his name tag is a small gesture that brushes against that question, then pulls his hand back before he has to answer it.

I'm just wondering if I'm the AH, my mum seems to think it's excessive and would be embarrassing for her to receive, we've had (in my view) an extremely unnecessary fight over it. But I do realise that I'm autistic so I don't have the best gauge of social niceties and I just need a bit of outside opinion here.

Mum seems to think that it's a terrible idea and highly inappropriate to give my friend $250, we got into an argument about it - Mum says that I don't see the friend often and the expectation could be there for her to reciprocate when my birthday comes around.

I feel that I truly don't care about reciprocation or the money (I'm not swimming in money but I have a tiny bit of emergency savings, I'm reasonably comfortable, and I did get paid this week lmao), I just want to assist the friend with getting this enclosure built as she's asked for donations for her birthday and it could make a good dent in the donations. I don't see this friend often but we're both disabled and we have a close connection whenever we do catch up.
I have a special place in my heart for her due to past connections with work and outside of work (atypical - we met while I worked in a crystal shop and got friendlier when we were on the committee for our local medieval festival) and having conversations surrounding our disabilities and trauma we've experienced in life. It's true that we don't catch up often, but I think highly of her and she always stops to talk to me in public or whenever she sees me.

We met at work about 5 or so years ago and since then have had coffee catchups, I've been to her place, we've had big deep-and-meaningfuls about life and sexuality and disability and I'd class her as a close friend even if we don't have a typical friendship.

So please, WIBTAH if I gave her $250 towards something she wants to build for her birthday? My mum has made me question myself with her remarks.",3,1764993253.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

[Image manipulation through *Adobe Photoshop* became common in the year *1992*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop#Early_history).

  - The [motion vectors](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ece417/fa2017/ece417fa2017lecture23.pdf) must have minimum temporal resolution [of standard motion pictures (24**FPS**)](https://softhandtech.com/why-is-24fps-the-standard/).
  - Motions (such as [*geometric translations*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry))) must match natural physics.

Is not required to have ""better than most"" experience with *Photoshop* (or equivalent [video manipulation tools](https://tripleareview.com/best-ai-video-editing-tools/)); [generative transformers](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer) (once setup) can use simple text (natural human language) prompts to do all this.

All which is required to produce forged semblances of you is:
- Setup [*TensorFlow*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow) to [import annotated media](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) of
  - inputs = normal individuals (with normal motions / poses, such as a man who walks around a store), plus textual descriptions (of the desired motions / poses to output),
  - outputs = those individuals in whichever motions / poses which the textual descriptions give.
- *TensorFlow* will produce mathematical [tensors](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor) which transform those inputs into those outputs.
- Once setup, the ""*average Joe*"" can (with little or no practice) use those tensors to upload input images (or videos) of you, such that [the algorithm synthesizes forged images (or videos)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference) of you.
  - The conclusion is not that it is acceptable to forge evidence, but that (since *average Joes* can forge evidence) humans should not trust images.

******

[In *2014*, *MicroSoft* released the **AR** platform ""*IllumiRoom*""](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/illumiroom-peripheral-projected-illusions-for-interactive-experiences/). [With *Kinect V2*, *IllumiRoom* can show forged (fictitious) wounds on you](https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-05-microsoft-roomalive-illumiroom.html#:~:text=wound). No methods are documented to discern such fictitious wounds from true wounds.
- Want [to know of other sources (sources except *Engadget*) to reference for this; the *Web-Search* assistant found none, but says that the first document (from *Microsoft*) ""provides enough information to infer that it is possible""](https://poe.com/s/bR7j68CnnTf6EF3hbDlL). Request to users; post other sources for this (if you want, will also give credit to you).

## *Artificial Neural Tissues* such as `tensorflow` which forge semblances of humans
*TensorFlow* has a [*Python*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) version, plus a [**C++**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/C++) version; if all you want to do is forge visuals (or sounds), the *Python* version requires the lowest amount of skill/practice plus is what most pornographers/forgers use (there are now numerous platforms which allow you to design photo-realistic “companions” through generative transformers, with romantic animations which you purchase with your credit card; most of those use the *Python* version of *TensorFlow*).
- The **C++** version is lower level (requires more specific knowledge to use, but allows lower **API** access, which suits assistants for school use, plus suits computer vision for autonomous tools.)

******

[This is an example of doctored evidence produced through a generative transformer (“**AI**”), plus generative-transformer-produced discussion of how to produce such doctored images, plus how the human visual cortices are so easy for modern software to fool](https://poe.com/s/si3VR3kC6mZu4vRqfaXx). Have concluded that other tools give more simple approaches to doctor images, which are documented in [Simple tools (to forge without *Artificial Neural Tissues*)](#simple-tools-to-forge-without-artificial-neural-tissues).

******

[This speculative tool](https://github.com/SwuduSusuwu/SusuLib/blob/preview/posts/CnsCompress.md) is for school use, such as attachment={`.mp4` of humans who assemble a transmission} prompt=""Produce a version of this `.mp4`, which has autonomous tools mass-produce such transmissions. Produce source code which programs the autonomous tools to mass-produce those"". But you can use attachment1={`.mp4` of a normal human who walks around a store} attachment2={`.mp4` of you as you performs actions on some dead pig} prompt=""Replace the human in the second `.mp4` with the human in the first `.mp4`. Replace the dead pig with the human in the second `.mp4`"" to produce some forged video which shows the first human perform an impossible action on you; to ""stage your own death"" with photo-realistic visuals.
- Such tools / systems, which (if produced) can function similar to whole nervous systems of grown humans have different attributes (than the ""**AI** tools"" above do):
  - Such [general-use](https://poe.com/s/Gk7CKqsyY8FcEM8kx1cm) (""[transfer learning](https://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/machine-learning/shavlik-group/torrey.handbook09.pdf)""?) nervous-systems / tools do not require topic-specific (subject-specific) [datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets) (do not require datasets of criminal nor zoophilic acts to forge those).
  - If produced, are the absolute ""Allows you to forge all which you can imagine with a few simple steps"" artificial neural systems.
  - As far as know, noone has produced those systems (since those require huge [datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets) (which must encompass all subjects at schools), plus ludicrous amounts of [**CPU**s / **GPGPU**s / **TPU**s](https://github.com/SwuduSusuwu/SusuLib/blob/preview/posts/SimdGpgpuTpu.md#table-of-contents) (to [process (""backpropagation"") those datasets into biases/coefficients for the artificial neural tissue](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/autodiff))).

## Simple tools (to forge without *Artificial Neural Tissues*)
Around the year *2000*, [edge detection](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection) (which separates subjects from backgrounds) was introduced to computers, which is simple to use for background removal; edge detection is sufficient to turn human subjects into [virtual “sprites”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)) which average users can use to forge new images. [Contour detection also suits such background removal](https://towardsdatascience.com/background-removal-with-python-b61671d1508a/).
- Those 2-dimensional “sprites” do not allow [*natural rotations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_%28mathematics%29#Three_dimensions), nor natural motions, such as the *Artificial Neural Network* solutions above do. But this section is about what was possible for consumers to do on personal computers back in the year *2000*.
- What those “sprites” do allow is [*geometric translations*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry)) (you can move the “sprite” around on new backgrounds), plus [*geometric resizes*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_(geometry)) (which simulates how distant or close the “sprite” is), plus 2-dimensional [*geometric rotations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_%28mathematics%29#Two_dimensions) (such as to show the subject “side-ways” or “upside-down”, but not to alter the orientation or direction).
  - If the legs are hidden (occluded), ""sprites"" can produce approximate motion pictures (but those still introduce artifacts which are noticeable to professionals, as opposed to the virtual models below which are 100% photorealistic (indistinguishable from natural humans)).
    - For ""depth motion"" (*z-axis*, to/from the viewport), just use rhythmic vertical (*y-axis*) *geometric translation* to produce ""bounces"", plus gradual *geometric resizes* to approximate motion towards/from the viewport.
    - For ""horizontal motion"" (*x-axis*, across the viewport), just use rhythmic vertical (*y-axis*) *geometric translation* to produce ""bounces"", plus gradual horizontal (*x-axis*) *geometric translations* to approximate motion across the viewport.
  - Consumer tools can store ""layers"" of backgrounds (at numerous depths), plus do [automatic occlusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-surface_determination) of ""sprites"" which move through those:
    - *Adobe*'s *Photoshop* has [tutorials to import composite assets](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/composite-photo.html), plus [set depths for occlusion](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop-elements/using/copying-arranging-layers.html#:~:text=stacking%20order)).
    - *Walfas*'s [*create.swf*](https://walfas.org/) has ([tutorials to import composite assets](https://walfas.org/?p=502#:~:text=insert%20external%20images), plus [to set depths for occlusion](https://www.deviantart.com/rsgmaker/journal/create-swf-User-Manual-by-Thefre-440171753#shortcuts)). Advantages (versus *Photoshop*): more portable (all computers / smartphones with web browsers can use `.swf`). Disadvantages: `create.swf` was designed to produce cartoons, so does not produce natural shadows (not even if the sprites are natural-resolution photos).
    - Back in *2000*, *Python* was sufficient to do so. [This source code is a reproduction of such tools from *2000*](./2_dimensional_forge.md).
  - Professionals can use the 2-dimensional [*DirectX*](https://github.com/walbourn/directxtk-tutorials), [*OpenGL*](https://github.com/Sibras/OpenGL4-Tutorials) or [*Vulkan*](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Tutorial) `canvas` to do this with more options (such as formulas which [mimic true shadows](https://www.naturalspublishing.com/files/published/7xrrw47j5di736.pdf)), but *Photoshop* is sufficient to produce photo-realistic images.
- In still photos, those “sprites” are photorealistic semblances of the original human subjects, but consumer software from the year *2000* which performs geometric translation does not produce photorealistic shadows if new backgrounds are used (shadows were limited to tools which asked you for the position of light sources, to produce “drop shadows” (similar to [*Windows 2000*’s “drop shadows”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2224220/win32-how-to-make-drop-shadow-honor-non-rectangular-layered-window)) based on the contours) which allows professionals to notice that such images are not true. New software can produce photorealistic (natural reflection+refraction) shadows.
- [Modern tools have improved background removal](https://www.codepasta.com/2019/04/26/background-segmentation-removal-with-opencv-take-2).

******

[Numerous formulas can use a few still images of human subjects to produce realistic virtual computer models of those](https://poe.com/s/9JQLcgm7EOIiHmcMcAZB). Virtual models (which consist of computer [texture maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping#Texture_maps) + [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(computer_graphics)) or [point clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud)) can do all which “sprites” can do, plus can do 3-dimensional [*geometric rotations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_%28mathematics%29#Three_dimensions), plus can produce natural motions (not just geometric translation, but [photorealistic animation of the model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_animation#Computer-generated_animation)), plus can use the [*Rendering Equation*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_equation) to produce true shadows (as opposed to just shadows which are indistinguishable to humans).
- This does not require **AI** ([*Artificial Neural Networks*](https://www.tensorflow.org/)) to use; this uses deterministic, reproducible calculus formulas.
- [*Meshroom*](https://github.com/alicevision/Meshroom) has [tutorials of how to do this](https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom-manual/blob/develop/source/tutorials/sketchfab/sketchfab.rst). Once those virtual models are produced, [export as `.obj` *Wavefront*](https://www.modelo.io/damf/article/2024/10/03/0611/how-to-export-meshroom-as-obj).
- [*Agisoft Metashape*](https://www.agisoft.com/features/standard-edition/) also has [tutorials of how to do this](https://agisoft.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/31000152092).
- [**AI**](https://www.tensorflow.org/) tools also have [tutorials of how to do this](https://artsmart.ai/blog/how-to-turn-an-image-into-a-3d-model-with-ai/), but the consul says not to use **AI** tools, so stick to *Meshroom*.
  - **AI** tools which produce motion synthesis of humans (such as [_**AI** Dance Generator_](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp8ljrpfdw8lsq)) are the most simple to use, are powered through [*Convolutional Neural Networks*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) which can allow general-purpose-use, but are often implemented for specific topics (with interfaces limited to, for instance, dances), as opposed to the absolute synthesis of all imaginable misrepresentative motion pictures of humans (which *Meshroom* can do).

For consumers who do not wish to use software interfaces to produce custom ""animations"" (motion vectors), plus who can not search for suitable motion vectors to use, formulas for ""motion capture"" allow consumers to use their own motions to produce motion vectors (such as [*Microsoft Kinect V2* mocap](https://github.com/moraell/KinectMocap4Blender?tab=readme-ov-file#presentation)).

Most consumer animation software can import computer models (such as [`.obj` *Wavefront* models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file)) + have those models perform movements from motion vectors (such as [`.fbx` *Filmbox* motions](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/out/filmboxfbx.html)):

******

The formulas above are so general-use that non-human subjects (such as cats, dogs, cars or vans) will also do. Problems:
- Since those formulas are not specific to humans, those formulas must use source images (*inputs*) with more resolution, use numerous source images, or both.
- More **CPU** power is used, since those formulas must ""start from scratch"" to produce the ""sprites"" or ""virtual models"".

Solution: formulas which start with ""hardcoded values"" (`const` / `static` coefficients) of an average human, allow *inputs* with less resolution, less images, or both. Plus, since human-centric formulas do not have to ""narrow down"" the ""search space"" from ""all possible topological configurations"" to produce ""sprites"" (or ""virtual models""), **CPU** power use is reduced.

- What is impressive about those tools is how few samples of target are required for realistic synthesis, plus how smooth the synthesized lip motions (which match those synthetic dialogues) produced are.

1pffg0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1pffg0a/adhd_medication/,ADHD medication,"I, (18F), started vyvanse around 5 months ago. 

I am completely healthy heart wise (as far as I know). I got an x-ray of my lungs a few months ago and they are healthy. 

I was first on 10mg of vyvanse. This didn’t do much and it was increased to 20mg. About a week in, I started experiencing a very uncomfortable feeling. 

I can’t describe it that well, but it’s definitely chest/heart related. It feels like a balloon is sitting inside my chest and there’s pressure. This pressure only happens on the left or right side, BUT it flips and I experience the feeling on both sides. I do not drink high amounts of caffeine, only green tea in the morning occasionally, never coffee or energy drinks. 

Sometimes it lasts 5 minutes, sometimes 30, sometimes hours. It’s not painful, it’s just uncomfortable and I’m very aware if that makes sense. 

Last Sunday I finally went to ER (after having this symptom for 3 weeks). I finally realized it was from my adhd medication on Sunday because I had surgery and stopped taking my med for a week. I experienced no chest pain when I wasn’t taking my med. When I finally took my medication again, I made the mistake of drinking coffee with it and the pressure was insane. The uncomfy feeling was trippled, so I called my psychiatrist and she told me to head to ER. 

They did an EKG, chest/heart x-ray, and ruled out any dangerous, life threatening issues. Nothing was wrong with me. 

I stopped my medication and about a week later I was started on Concerta ER 18mg tablets. I take it once a day early in the morning. Today was my second dose, and the pain is back. Psych doc said it’s less harsh on the chest/adrenaline system and I definitely agree, I’m a lot calmer, but man this sucks.

I have finals on Monday and I need to take it this weekend so I can study, but what the hell do I do? 

ADHD medication has saved my mental health. I barely graduated high school and was riddled with lack of focus and motivation to do anything. I genuinely feel normal now. Stopping medication scares me. For years and years I tried different antidepressants and nothing worked. I was finally diagnosed and my life did a complete 180. The main causes of my depression were environment and lack of motivation. 

If I still have chest pain in the next few days, what should be my next step? I’ll definitely call my psychiatrist and inform them of my symptoms, but could I have some sort of condition, or problem, and not know?

I’m definitely getting a referral to a cardiologist, but I genuinely have no idea what’s wrong. ER doctor said it might be some sort of friction or rubbing creating a pressure sensation but he obviously wouldn’t know for sure. 


Is this feeling normal for some people, and some just can’t tolerate medication? Is it too much on my nervous system? 

Any suggestions, comments, or experiences of your own would be greatly appreciated!

I work a corporate job and am mostly working from home (WFH), so I'm hoping to find someone to share some low-key, relaxing downtime with.

A Little About Me:
Interests: I love to keep busy! I enjoy working out (gotta stay healthy!), cooking up new recipes, getting lost in a good book, and definitely love to cafe hop for a good cup of coffee and atmosphere.

Vibe: I'm generally pretty chill, respectful, and value good conversation.

The Important Stuff: I am drug and disease free and expect the same mutual respect and transparency.

What I'm Looking For:
Someone who also enjoys the simple, cozy pleasure of platonic cuddling.

Someone respectful, communicative, and understands the platonic nature of this proposal (though open to a great friendship forming).

Bonus points if you have great book or cafe recommendations!

If I sound like someone you'd like to get cozy with or just grab a coffee with, please send me a DM/Chat! Let me know a bit about you, what you're looking for, and maybe your favorite book or cafe!

Moment of panic aside, you take interest and decide to continue talking with your new ghost friend.* 

\[\~1,700 words\]

\[starts off in a park during the day, the listener walking up to the speaker\]

… Oh my god, you’re talking to me?

No, I’m sorry, that probably sounded so rude to you, I wasn’t, um

\[they took a breath, clearing their throat\] You- you just surprised me is all, people don’t usually walk over to give genuine compliments nowadays. Thank you, by the way. Uh, I’m {Name}. 

It’s nice to meet you…

\[the listener went to walk away\]

Wait! 

\[awkward:\] I uh.. Would you want to chat for a bit? You seem really nice.

I was more so thinking just walking around the park, even though coffee does sound good. But we just met so let’s stay in the park for now. 

Oh- I guess it did get a bit chilly. Gotta loves those random end of spring breezes \[awkward/nervous laugh\]

\[the speaker and listener starting strolling through the park\]

So uh, favorite color?

\[chuckle\] What? It’s a solid ice breaker. Mine’s yellow. 

Pretty good choice. Did.. you see the game yesterday?

Y’know the game with the, uh, sports, heh, sorry I’m not a big sports person that was a stupid topic to pick.  

Oh, was there actually a game yesterday? How’d it go?

Nice! Goo team \[chuckle\]

What do you do for work?

That sounds pretty interesting. Do you like it? 

\[tiny chuckle\] I mean do you like the work itself, not the people. Might wanna hear more about that though, cause like, what?? \[more genuine laugh\]

How’d she think that was a sane thing to do?? Got the common sense of a toaster or something.

\[laugh\] Okay okay, I think I can beat you on crazy coworker. So I’m a teacher at an elementary school, right? You would expect other teachers to be rational people, that is not the case. We have this guy in the school who believes in this like ‘all natural’ teaching and care method where kids should only be learning using things from nature. 

Isn’t it? Another teacher told me it derives from a cult. 

It definitely sounds like it, huh? But no, yeah, he thinks it’s better for a kid's brain to count using wood chips instead of the little counting blocks the school has. 

They’re dirty *and* they can also give you sepsis. 

That’s a thing yeah, that’s why a lot of playgrounds are switching to mat grounds or the rubber stuff.  

Bit more insane than your coworker then?

Trust me if there wasn’t a teacher shortage he would’ve been fired long ago 

\[chuckle\] Luckily I didn’t have to personally interact with that guy much cause he’s first grade and I was fifth. His antics absolutely spread through the faculty fast though, believe me. 

Huh?

I- Crap I did say was. I uh- I had to take a leave of absence. 

…health issues? Why don’t you tell me more about your job though? Or any hobbies?

That sounds really fun, do you do that a lot or or-… \[quieter, embarrassed\] Oh no people are looking at you… 

I should go, I’ve taken up enough of your time. I really enjoyed chatting with you, you’ve no idea. 

I don’t know why people are staring, I really should go. Thanks again!

\[the speaker turned to leave, and the listener tried to grab their hand to stop them. There’s an echoey fwoosh as the listener’s hand passed straight through the speaker, who sputtered in regret and defeat\]

I’m sorry… I’m so sorry I haven’t talked to anyone in so long and you could see me, I… Hey, hey, don’t panic. Try to slow your breathing. 

…Yeah, I am a ghost.

And no one else can see me, that too. I’ll get out of your hair so you can calm down, I’m sorry again. Really.

What? Talk about what?

…You want to talk about me being a ghost. Do you actually?

Uh, okay but we should go somewhere with less people cause you’re getting a couple choice stares right now. 

\[they cracked up lightly\] Don’t- don’t say ‘sorry for being weird’ to them that makes it so much worse!

Shoosh stop talking to me out loud, let’s just go somewhere else before a cop shows up or something. \[small chuckle\]

\[they went to a more secluded forestry part of the park, sitting down away from people\]

… I’m sorry again for pretending. 

I hope you never end up in my shoes to see if you’d do the same. 

Hey, it’s okay to be awkward about this, this is absolutely freaky and weird and you’re not gonna hurt my feelings by asking questions.

I’m pretty sure I’m dead, yeah. 

For awhile I was holding onto the hope that I’m just stuck in some coma dream and I’ll eventually wake up but that doesn’t really seem like the case. 

I guess ghosts are real, though I have yet to meet another one. Maybe they’re everywhere but we all can’t see each other. 

I have absolutely no idea why you can see me. That’s why I was so incredibly caught off guard by you approaching me. I’m glad that you did though, especially since to you I looked like just another park go-er. 

\[tiny chuckle\] Thank you…

Who knows, maybe if I hadn’t died we would’ve been soulmates or something and that means you can see me.

Sorry- Sorry that was such a weird and depressing thing to say, god. 

Well, it wasn’t anything fun or exciting, like being murdered. I died in a car accident right next to the park that was fully my fault. The other person involved barely got hurt from what I could gather, so I just paid for my own stupid mistake.

It’s very lonely. I can’t talk to anyone or interact with them. I can pick up objects but there’s not many things to do with that. Plus people will get so freaked out, I’ve made that mistake before. 

At one point I snatched a drink while someone wasn't looking to see if I could drink it. \[small chuckle\] Didn’t work but it was nice to have a little bit of fun. 

I also unfortunately don’t get to do cool stuff like float off the ground or fly. I can walk through walls if I try really really hard though. 

Thanks for not bolting when you saw what I am. Actually talking to someone is amazing, not to mention talking about how stuff is for me. 

You’re really sweet… and you’re definitely taking all this much better than most would.

That, that’s really nice to hear. I guess I am still a person even with being some kinda ghost thing. 

Would you possibly want to meet up sometimes? I totally get if not I just really really like getting to talk to someone. And specifically talking to you too. 

Yeah? Awesome…

Oh, I have to stay in a certain area around where I died. So I’m stuck with some of the park and some of the city, but I usually stick to the park. Much more of a peaceful resting place if you get what I mean. Plus we shouldn’t meet up outside of the park cause y’know, people.

Let’s talk about other stuff though. You never told me more about your job…

\[the audio fades out into a timeskip, the listener walking up to where the speaker was and accidentally startling them\]

Christ, it’s just you. \[chuckle\] Usually it’s the ghost that spooks someone, not the other way around. How’re you?

That’s good. I’ve been… Well, same old same old. 

You already know I can interact with stuff, why?

Oh no, you have a bag of things. Should I be excited or full of dread?

…What’s this?

A journal, that’s… That’s so kind, oh my god. I’ll actually have something to do, to spend my time on. 

There’s more, seriously?

\[excited gasp\] You got me a game boy??? Like actually??

Cause it doesn’t have a touch screen, that’s so smart. Thank you so freaking much, that's amazing. 

\[laugh\] Don’t apologize for not having more gifts, I never would’ve expected these at all. 

What else do you have with you?

Board games sound incredibly fun, are you kidding? Yes I absolutely want to play them, c’mon get them out. 

You’re literally the best person ever, did you know that?

Make my non-life better you mean \[chuckle\] What games do you have? I wanna play all of them. 

\[the speaker laughed, the audio fading out again as there’s another timeskip. The speaker called the listener over as they walked up\]

Hey! There you are. Busy day today? You’re usually here right after work. 

You seem kinda nervous, everything alright? 

Yeah, yeah we can go sit in our spot, c’mon. 

\[the walked to their meet up spot, sitting down\]

What’s going on?

\[the speaker hesitated for a second\] ..That’s amazing! Why’re you upset about starting to date someone? 

…Ah \[faint chuckle\] You were scared I was going to be upset. Well, I'm definitely a little surprised, but also happy for you. I’m not upset by it at all, you don’t have to worry. 

That’s understandable, conflicted feelings and all. 

To be fully and entirely honest with you, I do love you. You’re an extraordinary person and it’s impossible for me not to, but I’m also not going to stop you from having a normal life. That’d be more than selfish of me. I can’t go on actual dates with you, or go over to your house or even hug you. I‘ve never have expected us to end up dating or anything like that. I want you to be happy, and if this person you’ve met makes you happy then I can’t ask for anything more. 

Of course…

Do we still get to meet up and play board games and DS mario kart? 

I have absolutely no complaints then \[chuckle\] 

Thank you for making everything better. 

I think you’ve given me more joy than the other way around, but thanks. 

Do you have anything with you today to play?

\[light gasp\] Yesss, I am so good at battleship. 

Let’s get that set up, and then how about while we play you tell me all about this person?

Awesome, sounds like fun. 

\[they listener gets the game out and the audio fades, the script ending\]

I'm a first time mom, about 8 weeks along. My pregnancy is going mostly pretty easily so far, except for the fact that my husband and I have hit a really rough patch in our relationship.

Part of the problem is that my husband - normally super chill and not the least bit controlling - has started side-eyeing me for EVERY little choice I'm making. He gives me a hard time for drinking any coffee at all, doesn't like that the first doctor I saw was my GP and not an OBGYN (I'm seeing one at 10 weeks and I guess that's too late in his eyes?) and any time I start crying or expressing stress, he says I'm harming the baby, which only makes me more weepy and stressed.

He was never, ever like this before. He was super easygoing and nonjudgmental. As soon as I got a positive test, he switched this part of his personality on like a light. I don't know what to do. Did anyone else's partner suddenly change like this?",10,1764992233.0,BabyBumps,12,1.0,False

26 'And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?'"" (John 11:25-26) 

Jesus says something here that most of us don't hear from any other source.  I think we humans are geared to search for answers to spiritual questions.  We're prone to seek truth outside ourselves because we know we don't have it all.  It's human nature to look to an earthly parent-figure for answers if we were raised by people who seemed to ""have it all together."" But our Messiah tells us, ""Call no man on earth 'father,' for one is your Father, He who is in heaven -- and you are all brothers. And do not be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Messiah."" ([Matthew 23:9-10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/mat/23/9-10/s_952009), [Jeremiah 3:19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jer/3/19/s_748019))

Life is a classroom. The lesson God wants to each us is how to live forever, in unity with Him and each other. Unfortunately, humanity without God either accepts death as part of life, or tries to find ways to live forever for selfish or pointless reasons. We have to look for answers from a teacher we want to emulate. Jesus showed us that He knew how to live forever by rising from the dead. He showed us how to make eternal life worth living with His teachings and His love. We aspire, as Enoch did, to learn to walk with God and become His eternal children.

Knowing who to learn from is of limited value if we think we already know what's being taught, and rush through our lessons. We've all heard ""love your neighbor as yourself,"" but how many of us love ourselves enough to make healthy choices all the time?  How often in my neighbor's emergency as high a priority as my own?  
We have to admit it when we're in the dark -- not just as an admission to ourselves, but to those who depend on us.  Facing our human insufficiency together lets us reach out to our Savior in unity.  ""Wherever two or three are gathered, there I am in their midst.""  ([Matthew 18:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/mat/18/20/s_947020), [Malachi 3:16-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mal/3/16-17/s_928017))  I didn't realize how powerful this was until my grown son said the best thing I did as a parent was to tell him that someday he would figure out that I'm not perfect, and that I hoped he still loved me when it happened. 

I'm blessed by Charles Spurgeon's interpretation of Jesus' parable, The Pearl of Great Price. He said that for Jesus, we humans were the pearls of great price and the hidden treasure that Jesus gave up everything for.  When we truly appreciate the depth of suffering Messiah went through for us, it changes our hearts. He becomes our Pearl; our greatest pursuit in life.  He's worth everything we give up so we can be His hands and feet to the world.  I could barely give up a cup of coffee for the sake of a higher good when the Lord blessed me with this truth.  I'm thankful He doesn't leave us like He finds us!  ([Luke 14:27-33](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/luk/14/27-33/s_987030), [Romans 12:1-2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/rom/12/1-2/s_1058002), [Ezekiel 16:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/eze/16/6/s_818006))  

I don't know how Jesus does it, but His parables keep me on track so I can draw closer and closer to Him.  When we, like the pearl merchant, give up worldly pursuits to have Jesus, for awhile, we have nothing but our precious Pearl.  Without our creature comforts, we find ourselves in the lowest earthly room at the wedding feast of His word. ([Job 23:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/job/23/12/s_459012), [Psalm 100:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/psa/100/3/s_578003), [John 1:1-4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jhn/1/1-4/s_998001), [John 1:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jhn/1/14/s_998014), [John 6:35](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jhn/6/35/s_1003035), [Song 2:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/sng/2/4/s_673004))

Friend’s (we’ll call John) wife (we’ll call Susan) invited me to go for a walk with her and her youngest baby (6mo) one day. I accepted because I could use the walk and wanted a chance to get to know her more. On the walk, she starts confiding in me that she’s been seeing another man (27M) and telling her husband she’s staying the night with her best friend. She’s been having an affair for the last 2 months, and she said her husband doesn’t know about it. I was beyond shocked she’s telling me all this, and just listen as she gloats about how great her ‘boyfriend’ is. I was questioning it, when he called and she excitedly picked up, put it on speaker, and talked to him in front of me. Clearly telling a man who isn’t her husband she loves him. She confides in me that she introduced her young children to the affair partner. After the walk I went home and just kind of…digested everything she said. 

Another mutual friend (33M) who knows her better than i do asked me to get coffee weeks later and as we’re chatting he brings up cautiously if I knew that Susan is cheating on John. I told him yes, and we kind of just said how shocked we are, and he seemed totally oblivious to it. If she’d told us, I’m sure others know. She’d even shown us both pictures of affair partner. S

Fast forward to last week, he apparently found a photo of them nude together (no idea how) and was very upset. She told him she only slept with someone once. He told me this in private one day, clearly shaken by it. Ever since, I’ve been trying to decide: should I tell him? 

So here’s the dilemma- I feel strongly he needs to know, because id be so hurt if I was being cheated on and my friends didn’t tell me. His wife is a bit…erratic, and I don’t want her to know I’m the one who told him just in case she’s crazy about it. She’s obviously told more people than just me.

So WIBTA if i created a fake number and text John to let him know his wife has a boyfriend? And has been cheating? 

ETA: the reason I don’t want to tell him myself is because his wife is..less than stable. She has a felony charge for falsifying information to the cops, lying to try to get back at others to the police, and generally being crazy. She knows where I live, and I all have children, and I don’t want to risk anything involving her going for revenge for telling him and having it impact my family. Sorry, should have made that more clear on why I don’t want to confront him myself ",14,1764991810.0,WouldIBeTheAhole,23,0.89,False

From that moment on, Mitchell and I became mortal enemies.
He drove a car straight into my father’s funeral.
I smashed his mother’s urn on the dock and scattered her ashes into the sea.
Our hatred consumed us, sharp and venomous. We spent ten years wounding each other until we finally wore ourselves out.
He took his crew and left for Mexico.
I stayed in New York and became the city's most sought-after bounty hunter.
But when we met again years later, he was neither my enemy nor the boy I once knew.
He walked into the morgue—into the room where I was lying.
Years later, we finally got the chance to faced each other in silence.

After finishing my job, I hurried back to the small bakery I used as a front to tend to my injuries.
The wall-mounted TV showed Mitchell Harvey's return.
The former golden boy of New York's elite circles, now Mexico's top arms dealer, was back in town. Of course, it was headline news.
I roughly bandaged my wound and moved toward the small memorial corner I kept for my father.
Suddenly, a girl with chin-length hair burst into the shop.
She looked serious but spoke loudly. Clutching red roses, she pointed at the display case. ""I'll take everything here!""
Close behind was Roderick Dunlap, Mitchell's best friend and right-hand man.
When he saw me, he froze, his expression tightening. ""Yas, maybe we should go somewhere else?""
The girl refused immediately. ""No way!
""I brought Mitch desserts from here before. He said they were amazing. It's his birthday today. I need to get more.""
She gave me a pleading look. ""Ma'am, my fiancé's returning today. He loves your pastries. Could I use your space for a birthday surprise?""
I couldn't refuse, so I nodded.
""Could we get some extra desserts?"" she asked.
I agreed, noticing my fresh bandage was already bleeding through.
I hid my hand under my apron and walked unsteadily toward the kitchen.
It wasn't fear or nostalgia.
My illness was flaring up again.
It was incurable.
""Roderick, we're running out of time! Help me set up! Mitch's gonna be here any minute, and I want everything perfect.""
Roderick didn't move.
He knew Mitchell was never happy to see me.
On the news broadcast, Mitchell smiled for the cameras, yet his eyes remained cold.
""I'm sure she's watching too. I'm looking forward to... seeing her again.""
 
###Chapter 2
The camera zoomed in, highlighting the scar bisecting his eyebrow.
It was my doing, with a knife.
I was having a bad day, and he was there. So, I attacked him.
The ugly scar on my neck was his doing. He crushed a glass and used a shard to attack me.
Again, there was no deep motive.
We had a simple understanding: hurt the other, get hurt in return. We liked seeing each other in pain.
The news anchor smiled suggestively. ""Planning a long stay, Mr. Harvey? Those roses... Are you meeting someone special?""
He paused, his voice low. ""My fiancée.""
In the shop, the girl was adjusting roses in a candelabra. She glanced up at the TV.
""Roderick,"" she said, ""I heard Mitch had some messy history with a girl here for ten years. You know anything about that?""
I kept my head down, polishing a knife, but felt Roderick's gaze flicker toward me.
""Mitch!"" Her shout cut through the tension.
She forgot her umbrella and dashed outside.
""Yas.""
Mitchell caught her in a one-armed hug, his umbrella shielding her from the rain.
She rose on her toes and pressed a quick, rain-damp kiss to his lips.
I thought I saw him lean back, just slightly.
Then his eyes found mine through the wet glass.
The girl tried to turn, but he cupped her chin and kissed her again, deeper this time.
I looked away and snipped the ribbon I was holding.
Roderick approached.
""Paulette,"" he said, voice low. ""It's his birthday. For one night, could you just not anger him?""
He hesitated, seeming to think of something. ""She's nineteen. Clean slate. Reminds him of you before.""
I nodded, my fingers feeling numb.
""She's pretty. Prettier than I was.""
The door opened. Mitchell stood there, folding his black umbrella.
""Discussing my fiancée?""
His tone was light, but his stare was cold as it rested on me.
 
###Chapter 3
Roderick watched me, holding his breath.
He was waiting for one of my classic outbursts.
Instead, I simply pushed the boxed cake toward them. ""Your dark chocolate cheesecake.""
Yasmine Murphy gazed at Mitchell with adoration. ""Try it, Mitch. Is this your favorite?""
He took a sip of coffee, rubbing the edge of the cup, before cutting a small piece with the silver dessert fork.
""Bitter. Unpleasantly so. Not for me.""
His tone was light, his eyes smiling as he teased Yasmine.
She looked confused and took a bite herself. ""It's delicious! You're lying to me again!""
She didn't see that his gaze remained fixed on me over her head.
Suddenly, the door chime jangled loudly.
""Hey, Mitch! Welcome back!""
A few men crowded in, their laughter cutting off abruptly when they saw me.
Their eyes followed me, wary and questioning, before turning to Roderick.
I carried over the pot of lemonade. The men flinched in unison, raising their hands defensively, as if I were holding acid.
Back when Mitchell and I were at each other's throats, his crew got caught in the crossfire a few times.
It was never anything serious, just minor incidents. I was surprised they still reacted this way.
Someone nudged Roderick. ""Roddy, what's she doing here?""
Roderick just shrugged, not explaining.
""Enjoy your lemonade,"" I said, turning to leave.
Yasmine caught my wrist. ""Wait! Could you take a picture for us?""
""No,"" I said, calmly removing her hand.
I'd only taken a few steps when a figure moved to block my path.
I looked up to see Mitchell's gloomy face. ""I know how this works,"" he said, his voice flat. ""Everything has a price. So name it. How much to get you to...""
He paused deliberately, waiting for me to react. When I didn't, he finished coldly. ""Take a picture for us.""
I looked him over and tried to step around him.
A sharp pressure on a nerve in my arm sent a jolt of pain through me, and my legs gave way. I fell to my knees. A black card was flung down, its edge catching my cheek and drawing a thin line of blood.
""That's more than enough to make you disappear.""
I pushed myself back to my feet, my fingers gingerly touching the cut, my eyes fixed on Mitchell.
Yasmine quickly stepped between us, her smile strained. ""Mitch, stop it, okay?
""Sorry, miss. He must have had too much to drink.""
But he didn't smell of alcohol. He was simply picking a fight, same as always.
It convinced me he'd been having such a good time abroad that he'd forgotten who he was dealing with.
I bent down, picked up the black card, and stood facing him again.
His friends let out a low laugh.
""Some things never change. She still jumps for money.""
He held out his phone with a confident smirk, pleased by my apparent cooperation.
I moved fast. I grabbed his jaw, scraped the edge of the card through a thick glob of chocolate frosting, and shoved it into his mouth.
I didn't stop until I smelled blood. Then I grabbed two glasses from the table and poured the liquor down his throat.
""Consider your mouth cleaned,"" I said.
I turned and slapped the man who had spoken. ""Learn when to keep quiet.""
The whole thing was over in seconds. No one else moved. The only sound was the rain hitting the windows.
Roderick, leaning against the far wall, drained his glass and sighed heavily. ""I told you not to provoke her.""
Yasmine finally snapped out of her shock, her posture defensive as she confronted me. ""We were out of line first. I get it. But this is just insane!""
She raised her hand to strike me.
""Ah!"" I caught her wrist mid-swing and slapped her, hard, across the face.
The sound was sharp in the quiet room.
Mitchell spat out a mix of blood and frosting, a cold smile on his lips. ""You want a fight with me? Fine. But you can't touch her.""
He pulled the sobbing Yasmine close, her cheek still swollen from the slap. ""How about I trash this place for you? Will that make you feel better?""
She nodded and covered her cheek, tears in her eyes.
His bodyguards in black swarmed in. Clubs swung down, shattering glass and smashing the overhead light.
Cold wind and rain blew through the broken windows, soaking my face.
Mitchell gripped my chin, forcing my head up.
""You didn't start this. But she needs to see it end. Send me the bill for the damages. All of it.""
His eyes scanned me like I was a piece of discarded furniture.
I shoved his hand away, a sudden coughing fit seizing me. I frantically searched through the wreckage.
A small white prescription bottle rolled into view. My eyes locked onto it.
He was faster. He bent down and plucked it, reading the label.
""Six of these at once? Are you trying to kill yourself?""
He tossed the bottle into a rainwater puddle, put his arm around Yasmine, and walked away.
I knelt by the puddle, retrieved the bottle, and swallowed two more pills.
This medication was for anxiety and pain.
I started with half a pill. Now, eight couldn't stop my pain.
The pills were nearly gone. And so was I.
 
###Chapter 4
Three years passed, and my mother died too.
My work was unstable. I'd taken many lives and become a target myself.
I'd spent all my savings on that bakery. Now, with it destroyed, I had nowhere left to go.
Maybe it was the pain seizing my limbs again, but I lacked the strength to move. I simply sat amidst the wreckage, letting the rain soak me.
Overnight, every major tabloid in New York led with ""Mitchell Harvey Returns to Wreak Havoc on His Ex.""
By sunrise, I was ready to leave.
Before going, I faced the shattered ruins and slowly bowed.
Mitchell appeared out of nowhere. He hauled me to my feet with one hand.
""It's just a bakery. Is it worth this?""
I slapped his hand away, steadied myself, and then struck him three sharp slaps across the face.
""My parents' memorial plaques were inside. They're gone now,"" I said, my voice flat. ""The bow was necessary.""
He worked his jaw, then smirked. ""Three slaps for your mother's memorial? Sounds like I got the better deal.""
I ignored him, staring at the devastation.
He stood behind me, deliberately twisting the knife.
""Paulette Sherman. I'm talking to you.""
I acted as if I hadn't heard and walked away.
He caught up in a few strides, blocking my path.
""Stop pretending you're fine! Look at yourself. You're ghostly pale. What are you trying to prove?""
""My old condition flared up. A little tired, that's all."" I looked up, offering a cold smile. ""Mitchell, did you really think you were important enough to affect me?""
But I knew the truth.
He'd come back specifically to make my life hell.
If I were still in good health, I wouldn't mind another round, maybe breaking a few of his bones in the process.
But now, just standing upright consumed all my energy.
In the hospital, the smell of disinfectant was nauseating.
Several doctors studied my scans, their expressions grim.
""How much of your last prescription is left?""
""It's gone.""
""Gone?!"" Steven Harriman's voice rose sharply. ""That was a three-month supply! It's only been a week!""
Steven had handled my case for years. His hesitation told me everything—my time was running out.
""Is... there anyone else in your family?"" he asked carefully.
""Have you forgotten?"" My tone was flat. ""My father's dead. My mother's gone. It's just me.""
He removed his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose. ""You were managing well for three years. What happened this past week...""
My phone screen lit up with a news alert—a prominent photo of Mitchell with Yasmine on his arm at some gala.
The person I thought I was over still hurt me the most.
Mitchell was the source of my deepest wounds, the one who knew how to hurt me most without leaving a mark.
""Your condition is extremely unstable. After stopping the medication, the first week, the first month, and the third month are all critical periods.
""Take this,"" he said, handing me a small bottle. His voice was heavy. ""Three pills when the pain is severe. No more than three.""
Before he finished, I'd twisted the cap off, shaken a handful into my palm, and dry-swallowed them.
The number didn't matter, as long as it dulled the bone-deep agony.
A week or three months made no difference to me.
After taking the pills, I crouched in the most inconspicuous corner of the hospital corridor, my back pressed against the cold wall.
I'd figured out that lowering my body temperature could ease the pain.
Cold sweat soaked through my thin clothes.
For ten minutes, I listened to the desperate prayers and weeping outside the operating room, where all hope hung on a single, fragile thread.
""Mommy, isn't that the lady who was in the bed next to us? Should we say goodbye?""
""Her illness... There's no cure. Let's not bother her. Such a tragic case. No family left, and such a severe sickness. She probably won't even have anyone to hold a funeral for her.""
The little girl looked up, confused. ""But surely someone in the world cares about her, right?""
I blinked hard, clearing my blurred vision, and focused on my phone screen.
A text came from Mitchell.
He'd been messaging since last night, persistently asking what compensation I wanted.
I thought about it. Maybe no one cared, but there was one person who could handle the funeral arrangements.
I dialed the number I knew by heart.
He answered instantly.
""Made up your mind?""
I took a sharp breath, swallowing the metallic taste in my mouth. ""If you insist on paying me back, Mitchell, you can be the one to bury me.""
 
###Chapter 5
Silence stretched for seconds on the other end, followed by Mitchell's mocking laugh.
""Paulette, someone as vicious and stubborn as you usually lives forever. But if you do somehow die before me, rest assured, I'll give you the most lavish funeral New York has ever seen. I'll have the whole city light memorial candles for you!""
Satisfied with his promise, I hung up.
Outside the hospital, I saw the mother and daughter again.
The little girl was pounding her chest, her voice full of childish conviction. ""Who says nobody cares about her just because she has no family? Well, I do!""
""Enough, let's go. The bus is. Oh, the bus!"" Her mother pulled her away, rushing for the departing bus.
I walked to the parking garage and got into my black sedan.
Seeing they'd missed the bus, I impulsively rolled down the window. ""Get in. I'll give you a ride.""
I dropped them off downtown. They thanked me profusely and got out.
Just as I was about to pull away, I heard an irritating voice.
""Well, look at that. Paulette did a good deed. I suppose even you need to score some points.""
Mitchell's usual crowd was exiting a nearby club. Yasmine clung to his arm, her gaze sharp and venomous.
I didn't want a scene. I started raising the window to leave.
But Yasmine hurried over and pressed her hand against the glass.
A fake smile played on her lips, but her eyes were cold. ""I just found out about your history with Mitch. I hope we didn't... upset you yesterday?""
I had no patience for her act and tried to close the window again.
She gripped the window frame tightly. ""I have something for you. I really mean no harm.""
""I'm not interested. Get lost."" My patience was gone.
Yasmine suddenly let go. As I started the car, she pulled a small urn from her bag.
""I heard your mother's memorial plaque was destroyed in the shop. I gathered some ashes from the ruins this morning so you'd have something to remember her by.""
Her voice was sweet, but her actions were pure malice.
She reached through the window and poured the contents of the urn onto my passenger seat.
""Oh! You... you didn't catch it!"" she cried, stepping back with a perfect mask of innocence and sly satisfaction. ""You're not mad at me, are you?""
I watched her performance, and a sudden anger burned through the sickness inside me.
Good. She asked for this.
The group by the club entrance, clueless, was still praising Yasmine. ""Yas is so thoughtful, talking to that mess and even giving her a gift.""
Yasmine confidently turned and walked towards a shiny new Porsche parked ahead, triumphantly shaking her key fob.
I rolled down my window and called out, ""Yasmine! I have a gift for you, too!""
Yasmine turned, crossing her arms smugly. ""What are you giving me, Paulette?""
I tightened my seatbelt, my eyes locking on her. ""A one-way trip.""
Before the words faded, I slammed the accelerator.
""Bang!""
The front of my car smashed into the Porsche's rear.
Yasmine's car lurched forward uncontrollably.
I reversed, then slammed the gas again, hitting it a second time!
In the rearview mirror, I saw the drunken group jolt into sobriety.
""She's insane! She's actually insane!""
""I told you she was a lunatic! But you had to provoke her!""
""Relax, she won't really do anything. She's just blowing off steam, and then...""
He didn't finish.
True, I was blowing off steam.
But I wasn't done yet.
Yasmine stumbled out of the smoking car, her face pale, already slipping back into her fragile victim role.
""Mitch, wh... what did I do wrong?""
Mitchell had a cut on his forehead from flying glass, bleeding slightly. He moved urgently to shield Yasmine.
He understood my intent in a single glance.
""Paulette! Don't you dare!""
Ridiculous. There was nothing I dared not do.
I kept my eyes on Yasmine, my expression icy, and floored the accelerator.
The engine roared as the car shot straight toward her.
 
###Chapter 6
I unbuckled my seatbelt, got out, and coldly observed Yasmine sprawled on the pavement a few yards away.
Her legs and arms were scraped and bleeding.
""You're lucky I let off the gas. Otherwise, you'd have more than scratches,"" I stated calmly.
She looked up, her eyes filled with naked hatred. ""Mitchell will make you pay for this!""
I picked up my handbag from the passenger seat, now soiled with the ashes, and used its corner to lift her chin. ""There. The real you is much more tolerable.""
I took the bag back, dusting it off with disgust. The group rushed over.
Mitchell hurried to help Yasmine up.
I took out my phone, called an ambulance, then tossed the handbag toward Yasmine.
""This bag's resale value is about 20,000 dollars. More than enough for her medical bills and the car repairs.""
""Paulette!"" Mitchell's voice was thick with suppressed rage.
I ignored him and walked away.
The taste of blood filled my mouth. I pressed my lips together and quickened my pace.
I nearly ran from the scene. Rounding a corner, sure I was out of sight, I braced myself against a wall and coughed, splattering dark blood onto the grimy brick.
A ringing filled my ears, my vision blurring. I forced myself onward, moving on instinct until I reached my temporary apartment.
If my body had held up, I might have turned back to cause Mitchell more trouble. I desperately wanted to see him furious and helpless against me.
I collapsed near the living room coffee table and poured a glass of water.
But after one sip, I coughed it all back up—water and blood.
The half-glass of water instantly turned crimson.
I lay on the floor, gasping for air. It felt like an invisible hand was twisting my insides. The pain was maddening, but I lacked even the strength to clench my teeth.
I had no idea how much time had passed before the buzzing of my phone and violent pounding on my door dragged me back to consciousness.
For a moment, I'd thought I wouldn't make it through the night.
The name flashing on the screen was Mitchell.
""Paulette! Open the door! I know you're in there!""
His voice came through, threatening and absolute, while the door thumped under his force.
""If you don't open it, I'll break it down!""
I knew he meant it. But I would never let him see me like this—broken and dying.
Summoning the last of my strength, I crawled into the bedroom, moved the wardrobe, and squeezed into the narrow hiding space behind it. The sound of the door being forced open echoed from outside, followed by hurried footsteps.
His texts flooded my screen, one after another.
""Hiding? You think that works?""
""Get out of here! We need to talk!""
""If anything happens to Yasmine, I'll make you pay with your life!""
I stared at my phone. A sudden drop of nosebleed hit the screen, forming a dark red stain. My consciousness faded.",1,1764991601.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

Is that really why you came?"" she asked again, her warm, longing gaze locked with mine as I held in the rage boiling inside me, threatening to explode.
Fahk no. Audrey isn't the only reason I came for her. But there's no way in h.ll I'm admitting that if she keeps clinging to these fahked-up pretences and playing along with those ridiculous lines. Did she really forget?
""Why am I even here? You left on your own, anyway. You've never changed—not now and not seven years ago. You've only ever cared about yourself. But can we drop the fahking pretence and have an honest conversation for once?"" I snapped, my anger simmering over, unable to mask the pain I'd carried through time.
Fahk it. I thought I was done feeling this way. I thought our story ended seven years ago. So why the h.ll did she have to waltz back into my life and stir shllt up again?
We were fine. Why do I have to fall for her all over again—like a dammmnn idiot?
How did we even get here? I wondered, my gaze stuck on her in raw frustration.
I could still remember those little moments we shared in that frustrated pasts, when she'll stick up for me even when things were difficult, were those emotions I caught in her eyes back then fake?
because now…her clueless, pleading expression remained, as if I'd said something cruel and incomprehensible.
How can she lie to me so easily and expect me to just take it? Am I supposed to let this slide like it's nothing?
""Grayson, if you could just explain what you mean—I really don't know what you're talking about."" Her voice trembled, anxious and afraid, though she tried to hide it behind that fine, confused expression I wanted to distort with both pain and pleasure.
This is how it's always been—running in circles, our feelings tangled and unresolved.
Why do I want to make her cry... yet also make her smile so brightly, like she's never known pain?
""Are you seriously going to keep this up? Pretending not to know me? Not to know Audrey? Lia, for fahk's sake, that's not how lies work. We lived together. We loved each other. We had a kid together—for crying out loud! What the fahk do you mean you have no idea what I'm talking about?"" I shouted, exasperated.
Why does she keep holding on to the same dammmnn lie?
Yeah, things were pretty fahked up seven years ago—we were both students. Maybe having a kid as college juniors broke us a little. But it wasn't the end of the world.
We did our best. We lived through it like adults. And maybe things were rocky, but after a year of mending wounds and taking responsibility for each other's mistakes, I really thought our feelings had become clearer.
Our relationship might've started on lies and deceit, but we got past that. The pain turned to scars, and from those scars, love bloomed. Audrey bloomed. Our mistake—my greatest treasure.
I never imagined she had it in her to abandon our baby. To abandon us the moment she gave birth—disappearing without so much as a goodbye.
Even before Audrey was born, I saw the signs: the frustration, the resentment in her eyes when she thought about what she could've achieved if Audrey wasn't in the picture.
I probably shouldn't have brushed it off as just pregnancy hormones.
I didn't care that I had nothing to my name when I was left with a tiny little bundle of life who became my bundle of joy—my reason to keep going. I healed. I was happy.
And then she showed up again.
I wish I'd tried harder to keep her away.
Why did she have to bring all those buried feelings back? Why did I let her in again?
""Grayson, I really don't know what you're talking about."" Her voice was calm now, her eyes steady, but it was the same dammmnn line.
Frustrated, I demanded, ""We're really sticking to that, huh?""
If she's already decided to lie—and I can't bring myself to force the truth out of her—then I guess this is it.
""Did we really know each other?"" she asked in a small voice, and I turned away, pretending not to notice the tears glazing her eyes. I hated how soft and broken she sounded, how her pain somehow seemed deeper than mine, as though my words were nothing but cruel accusations that stung.
I hated how easily she pulled at my emotions. Even through the rage and heartbreak, I wanted to wipe her tears and kiss those dry, peach-colored lips until we forgot everything.

""You make it sound like I'm making this shllt up. I really can't remember, Ray. Why won't you believe me? Seven years ago I—""
""You claim you've forgotten—but why did you call me that?"" I cut in sharply. Her bottle-green eyes darted nervously—not with fear, but confusion, like she was surprised by her own words.
""I—I... I don't know. I just—""
I cut off her rambling with a hollow laugh, letting it carry all the complicated, messy emotions swirling inside me.
""I guess I was that easy to forget."" My voice dropped cold. ""Seven years, and everything we shared turned to smoke for you. I guess that's how much I mattered. That's how much we mattered.""
With no control left, I buried my fist into the nearest expensive vintage table, and she flinched at the sound, fear flashing in her eyes.
I hadn't wanted to do this—not after I'd just rescued her from that bastard. But maybe I'm no better than him after all.
My gaze flicked to the bruise on her wrist, now darkened to a pale purple.
""I'm not making this up, Grayson. I really don't remember,"" she whispered, her voice still trembling, though now tinged with the same frustration I'd thrown at her. ""But I didn't forget because I wanted to, okay?""
""What the fahk does that even mean?""
My voice twisted into confusion, cutting through my rage.
And then, with reluctance, she finally confessed.
But her confession only dragged us back to where we never wanted to return—to the past.
To seven years ago.

/Thalia's POV/
""I'm sorry, Miss Kithson, there's nothing I can do. You'll have to retake the course next year since it's not even available in the summer program. Not only was your attendance terrible, but you haven't performed well in previous tests. That project was your chance to make up for it—and you screwed that up too. I'm afraid I can't help you.""
The 52-year-old professor said, lowering her glasses after reviewing my file.
""Ma'am, you've got to believe me! I did participate in the project. My name must've been omitted somehow!"" I pleaded, panic rising in my chest.
Okay… maybe I messed up. I didn't meet up with my group members, and I half-assed the research reports I submitted—but I didn't want to be anywhere near Grayson. I hate his guts. He hates mine.
The moment we were grouped together for the semester's final project—the one that counted as our entire exam grade—I knew I was screwed. I just didn't think it'd be this bad.
To avoid the daily awkwardness and middle-finger flips, I chose to work on the research and skip the group meetings.
Grayson didn't complain or protest—he just watched me walk out like he was okay with it. I should have known better. That motherfahker wasn't.
A couple of our group mates tried reaching out, but let's be honest—I'm not exactly known for being friendly. If I'd tried harder with them, maybe I'd have figured out that the perfectionist ditched my research completely, came up with a brand-new concept, and worked overtime on the project presentation without me.
I almost missed the presentation entirely. He didn't even bother to tell me about it—obviously trying to exclude me altogether.
If my best friend hadn't texted me the second my group got on stage, I would've missed the whole thing.
And just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, the presentation ended with Grayson Moore publicly highlighting everyone's contributions to the project.
He was fahking thorough.
While other groups just listed contributors vaguely—mostly whoever funded the thing—Grayson had six distinct credits to his name: project design, research, presentation, execution, editing, and management.
Me?
I had absolutely nothing. Not a single mention.
Now I'm being told I have to repeat the year because of it.
After the professor's final unapologetic, ""I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do,"" I was shoved out of her office and into the long, gloomy hallways filled with tech students drowning in deadlines and pre-exam burnout. Frustration clung to the walls like fog.
Everyone just wants to go home and recharge. The semester's been h.ll. But what's a week going to fix when the next semester starts right after?
Still, I've got my own problems.
If I find that son of a b.tch, I swear to God—I'll tear him apart.
Huffing and fuming, I stormed through the halls, scanning classrooms, labs, and lecture wings for Grayson.
Grayson, my class president and personal arch-nemesis, wasn't hard to spot.
Why?
Because he's the poster boy of the dammmnn electronics department.
And, unfortunately, the bastard looks good—something I hate to admit.
He's got this annoyingly sharp face always hidden behind glasses, standing tall at 6 feet with a solid, muscular build. His pecs stretch every flannel shirt he wears. Somehow, he even makes average denim jeans look tailor-made.
It's so irritating.
He pulls off casual wear like he's modeling it. Students at Finchley University even joke he's the hottest nerd on campus. While girls line up to worship the ground he walks on, I'd rather just ruin his entire life.
""Hey, asswipe!"" I yelled, barging through a crowd that had formed around him.
He was mid-sentence, explaining the project to a group of girls who clearly didn't care about the work—they just wanted to hear him talk in that annoyingly hot Canadian accent.
""You fahking maron!"" I snapped, shoving him hard.
But his body was so solid, it was like pushing a dammmnn wall. His chest felt like rock. Not the point—definitely not the point. I shoved those thoughts aside.
""How could you do that to me?! My entire year depended on that project. How could you remove my name!?""
He calmly bent down to pick up the glasses I'd knocked off. The girls all swooned at his perfect side profile. I rolled my eyes.
""We had 25 group meetings since the project began,"" he said, slipping his glasses back on. ""You didn't show up to a single one. You didn't contribute to the building process either, which I wanted to assign to you, not Nora. So tell me—why should I add the name of someone who did absolutely nothing?""
His apathetic voice made my blood boil.
""Do you have any idea what you did—?""
""Spare me the bullshlt, Thalia. If the project was important to you, you would've shown up.""
With that, he turned around, walking away like he hadn't just ruined my entire academic year.
I was stunned—furious—and I wasn't going to let him walk away.
Without thinking, I grabbed the drink from the nearest girl and splashed it all over him—coffee and milk soaking into his flannel.
The hallway went silent.
""Asshole,"" I spat.
But instead of shouting back, he scoffed, pulled off his soaked jacket, and revealed a tight black shirt underneath. As he wiped himself down, my eyes caught something I wasn't ready for: a small snake tattoo curling around his waist as his shirt lifted.
He leaned in close, his voice low.
""Doing this won't fix your grades. Have fun repeating the year… doofus.""
Doofus.
I turned bright red, humiliated beyond words.
The snickers and whispers around us didn't help.
Fahk. I felt like such an idiot.
And because someone filmed the whole thing—it's now viral on the school platform.
I didn't even think ""Doofus"" was loud enough to hear, but apparently, it was crystal clear on camera.
Just like that, I got a new nickname.
I wanted the bed to swallow me whole. Should I just drop out? I can't keep my grades up anyway.
""Hey, b.tch.""
I knew that voice.
""What do you want, Bee?"" I groaned, buried under my blanket, which was immediately yanked off by Bianca—ready to nag me.
""I can't believe you're sulking in bed just because you got held back a little,"" Bianca snickered.
She wouldn't get it.
She's prettier. Smarter. Her parents don't compare her to a perfect older sibling or remind her she was a mistake.
She didn't grow up being told she wasn't enough.
I didn't even want to study here. I wanted to open a dessert shop. Something small, meaningful.
But that was too much to ask from my parents.
""C'mon, get out of that bed."" She snapped her fingers as if highlighting the sense of urgency. 
""What?"" 
My bitter thoughts were cut off when Bianca sighed heavily, dragged me out of bed, dressed me up, and took me to a downtown strip club to cheer me up despite my grunts, grumbles, and loud protests, I just wish I could stay in bed. 
But we're both fans of the male anatomy... I shouldn't even be here.
I've got a boyfriend—even if things haven't exactly been going well lately.
""Wow, they look fantastic,"" Bee commented, and I finally glanced up from my drink.
The dancers had flawless physiques, moving sensually around poles.
""They're wearing masks?!"" I blurted.
Each dancer had a mask matching their costume—one even had a black Batman mask paired with matching briefs. Sexy? I wasn't sure.
""Apparently, it's the only costume-based strip club in the area. Adds to the mystery,"" Bianca said, eyeing a guy in a monster mask. ""There's something about not seeing their faces—it makes it spicier, y'know?""
But my eyes were glued to something else.
A tattoo.
A small snake curling around the waist of one stripper as he walked off stage.
It had to be a coincidence.
Still, I couldn't stop my legs from moving. I followed him backstage like a lunatic.
""What the fahk am I even doing?"" I whispered. ""It's not him... there's no way.""
What would our class president—our golden boy—be doing in a strip club?
He's too ""holy"" for this place.
Or... so I thought.
""Grayson?!"" I gasped.
Because, of course.
Just when I thought the day couldn't get any better.

/Grayson's POV/
""Ash, you're not up on your game today. Your movement was rigid and sloppy; you'll have to break out more moves if you wanna keep your fans hyped."" Patsy complained and I internally groaned as I watched him walk off with his usual ladylike stride. 
Ecstasy Delight is a lady-owned club where men are laid out like specimens while the ladies gawk at them. 
Not like I've ever had a problem with it since I'm an anonymous stripper. 
It pays the bills so I can't complain. 
""Grayson!"" 
A familiar voice cut through the noise, and I froze.
No one knows me by that name here—I go by Ash.
Who the h.ll…? 
The next 1 min knocked some air out of my lungs as an agonising feeling of dread settled deep inside my stomach, which dropped the moment I turned to see the last person I'd wish to see in that situation. 
I blinked furiously as I watched her pinch her cheeks like she couldn't believe what she was seeing.
Realising she might call my name again, I grabbed her wrist and dragged her into my dressing room. I quickly slipped into a bathrobe in the corner to cover my nudity—since all I had on was the club-issued sexy briefs.
""What the fahk are you doing here, Kithson!? Did you follow me?"" I snapped, horror laced into my tone, masked by a hostile stare and clenched jaw.
 
""The question is, what the fahk are you? Is it even legal for a college student to work here... as a stripper?"" she hissed. 
""Wait—do the professors know you work here? This is unbelievable.""
Her snicker was laced with mockery, her tone thick with scorn. 
Typical Thalia; she was exactly who I thought she was. 
Privileged and ignorant.
She had everything handed to her and no clue how the real world works.
""You're not telling anyone,"" I warned flatly.
She scoffed. ""Watch me!""
She turned to leave but I blocked the door and held her back, my hands a little shaky from the fear that gripped my entire body. 
If Thalia walked out that door and told anyone what I do… I'm definitely screwed. 
My scholarship can only do so much; it wasn't even enough to cover my feeding expenses, if I lose my scholarship because of this, I might have to give up school. 
""You're shaking!? Are you really that scared of me airing your dirty laundry? I can't believe this! You treat everyone else like shllt, like they're beneath you but you're a fahking stripper. Because of you—"" 
She paused, rage lighting up her eyes and in a heated tone, she continued. 
""Because of you the last two years have been nothing but h.ll. All because you happened to be smarter!"" 
She tried to push past me, but I tightened my grip until she winced. 
""Look, I'm sorry, okay… but this is really important to me. You…you can't tell anyone about this, please."" 
My voice wavered at the end.
""Why the fahk should I listen to you!? Because of you, everything I did for the whole year went down the fahking drain. If you'd told me attendance mattered, I'd have attended even if I had to crawl over from my hospital bed, you maron."" She lashed out. 
""Wait, you were at the hospital!?"" My eyes widened in disbelief. 
Thalia Kithson has been nothing more than an irresponsible dork to me since freshman year. 
I saw her parents trying to help her settle at the dorm during freshman year and watching her lash out at them as they gave her everything I wished I had made me envious but instead of taking advantage of that, she partied away and surrounded herself with the worst crowd. 
Everything about her irks me; she was wild and irresponsible, the type of person I abhorred and when she decided she wouldn't be showing up for the project prep, I was more relieved than upset. 
I knew she needed that project to hit her target grade to register for advanced courses next year but I had no intention of piggybacking her through it. 
She had to earn it, unlike me, but I didn't think she was at the hospital. 
""Yeah, you d.ckhead! I was treating my gastritis but you wouldn't know that since all it ever mattered to you was being perfect but I guess you aren't after all!"" She scoffed with a dramatic eye-roll that made me take a step back from her and sigh.
I never claimed to be perfect.
They just assumed I was.
It worked in my favor—I kept my scholarship. And if this semester goes well, I'll get a full grant and another scholarship for next year.
""What exactly do I have to do to make this right? No one can know about this, Thalia. I fahking mean it!"" Desperation seeped into my tone. 
She smirked—scheming. I could already tell.
It didn't matter. I just need to stall until the end of the session anyway. 
""Professor Lovre treasures you a lot. So I'm sure you wouldn't mind fixing my grade.""
""You know I can't do that. With the project already submitted and—""
""Don't give me that bullshlt!"" She snapped. ""Everyone knows how closely you are with the Professors being the class president and all. You asked what I want—this is it. I cannot repeat a fahking year because you think I don't deserve to pass, Grayson, so fix it."" She insisted. 
I sighed. 
""I'm not making any promises, Thalia. This might not work; I don't control them. If anything, they all just wanted a lackey who'd make their job easier; I just happened to be a good fit."" The last parts of my words came in a mumble because I didn't think it was possible to reverse the damage done. 
With the end-of-semester project already concluded and the list of participants already submitted, I thought it was impossible, but Professor Lovre actually listened when I explained it was an error on my part because I thought Thalia didn't send in her research, but she did, and fortunately, she didn't mind since it was my first time making that mistake. 
Even though I didn't use her research and analysis for the project execution, I just wanted to get her off my neck. 
""Happy now?"" I asked when we met in school two days later. ""You've been graded. You're not repeating the course.""
""Maybe,"" she replied smugly as we walked away from the professor's office.
I thought that was it.
But she kept showing up at my shows.
And when I told her to back off, she brought new demands.
I'm already drowning in my assignments and project work as it is, and now I have to do hers. 
""You're unbelievable,"" I declared as she sat on my dresser after one of my shows, her skirt slightly lifted in reaction while I muttered a few silent curses before tearing my eyes from her pale thighs. 
""Why can't you do your own dammmnn work? I'm already swamped as it is,"" I complained for the umpteenth time. 
""For one, you're smarter than me, and two—"" She grinned. ""I know your dirty little secret, so you might wanna put in a little more work if you want me to shut up about it,"" She threatened. 
""Fahking b.tch!"" I muttered under my breath. 
""What was that?"" She arched a brow. 
""Nothing but how long am I gonna have to do this for?"" I demanded. 
She shrugged, hopping down from my dresser in her skimpy skirt and crop top, leather jacket tossed over her shoulder. Her thigh-high boots matched her wi.ne-red shirt.
""I don't know, maybe until I'm satisfied and no longer think you're a fahking je.k."" Was,what she said but her eyes lingered on me more than usual; it's been like that for the past couple of weeks since she found out I worked at Ecstasy Delight. 
Every night I hit that stage, her eyes strangely followed me and even with the masks on, she could always tell my position. 
It still felt uncomfortable rolling around the pole and dropping down on all fours with her eyes following my every movement. 
But I got to understand what it meant when Thalia showed up to my dorm room in tears, her mascara smudged and her hair wet from the rain. 
I was ready to lash out at her if she brought over her fahking work again; it was becoming tiring to keep up with her annoying demands but when she showed up looking like someone chewed her up and spat her out, I didn't know what to do. 
""Are you okay?"" I asked, helping her settle on the shared sofa with my roommate, who fortunately was out tonight. 
""No, I'm not. I just got dumped."" 
Thalia was the honest type, impulsive too… unlike me who had a thousand faces, she wasn't the type to hide, but she didn't need to; she wasn't the orphan fighting to survive. 
""Sorry, I guess,"" I replied as I returned to my desk to finish up my work but I couldn't just leave her sulking on my sofa like some abandoned puppy but I didn't have to; she was already rummaging through my fridge like she owned the place. 
""You've got booze!"" She exclaimed, gulping down my roommate's beer while I groaned from my desk. 
""That's Nathan's,"" I told her but she kept drinking anyway. ""You could have just hit the bar or something. Why come here?"" I complained but instead she handed me a can of beer. 
""No thanks, I'll pass. I've got to finish this tonight. It's due tomorrow,"" I reminded. 
""You are such a killjoy,"" She said with a dramatic eye roll before flopping at the foot of my bed while I wondered how I could get her to leave but when I turned to look at her again, she was shivering. 
She should really get off those clothes. I thought, walking over to the bathroom and returning with a towel, which I draped over her shoulders. 
""You'll catch a cold if you don't head back,"" I told her but…
No response instead Thalia's lips suddenly met mine, leaving me completely frozen still. 
What the fahk? Is she drunk?

I was sitting at my kitchen table with my laptop in front of me one afternoon, since I had chosen to work from home. I would have surely gone insane if I had to sit in a stale, boring office for hours while taking calls from angry customers screaming about their car insurance. It was already boring enough as it was. I sighed, pulled my laptop closer to the edge of my kitchen table and put my headphones back on, ready to take another call. While a man told me about an issue he was having with his insurance company, I began to hear faint static in the background. It got progressively louder, to the point where the man’s voice became inaudible. Within the sound, I heard a low distorted voice that made me tense up. I knew what was coming.

“Simon says... Insult your customer,” it said.

I could almost distinguish hidden amusement in the voice, like it enjoyed playing with my life. I took a deep breath, knowing I had no choice.

“God, you suck!” I exclaimed.

It was all I could come up with under the pressure. Immediately, all sound cut off and the man’s voice came back.

“What the fuck did you say?!” he screamed.

“Sorry, sir!” I said. “My cat jumped on my keyboard.”

The man sighed, said he would call somewhere else, and hung up. I leaned back on my uncomfortable chair and shut my eyes. I felt embarrassed, but relieved that I would not end up dead today. I wondered who would have found me first? My girlfriend? My dad? My employer? A series of thoughts kept repeating in my head and anxiety quickly set in. Evidently, the entity that voice came from was not confined to the radio anymore. That fact filled me with a cold dread. I wondered where it would end, what it meant, why it changed. Was it evolving? The rest of my shift was uneventful and, though I was on edge during every call that came next, I managed to help every customer to the best of my abilities.

I desperately wanted to understand what was truly happening. I had to know what was causing all of this. I was afraid, constantly unnerved and the endless spiral of anxiety-induced thoughts kept me awake way too late at night. My previous research had been less than helpful, so I knew I had to take a different approach this time. I thought about turning on the news, but decided against it.

Instead, I decided to call the non emergency police line. My expectations were not high, but I was hopeful that they could at least give me some information. I picked up my phone and dialed the number.

“Non-emergency police, this is Isabel speaking,” the woman on the other side of the phone said. “Who am I speaking with?”

“Hi, my name is Jack,” I answered.

“Alright. Jack,” she said. “How can I help you today?”

“Well...” I began but I was already trailing off. “I was wondering if you knew what was going on with the whole ‘Simon says’ radio voice and everything. You know, with what happened at the grocery store...”

Isabel stayed silent for a few seconds before speaking again.

“I’m sorry, sir, I’m not allowed to divulge any information on the matter at the moment,” she said more sternly. “The event is still under investigation and hasn’t been made public yet.”

“Please,” I almost begged. “Please, I just want to know... I’m scared, I just want to understand.”

“I’m sorry, sir,” she repeated. “As I said, the investigation hasn’t been made public yet and...”

“Please!” I was practically screaming into the phone by that point. “I was there! I saw the bodies, the blood, I saw them all dead in front of me! All of them! I just need to know! I need to know, so I can sleep at night. I can barely sleep, I keep having nightmares. I see them in my dreams, in my head, all the time. I keep remembering what they looked like...”

“Alright, alright, Jack. Listen,” she interrupted me, her voice softer now. “All I can say is that we think it was probably caused by a gas leak. It seems like the most likely explanation. I can’t say anything else, telling you more could get me in career-ending trouble. Now, I recommend that you seek professional mental health help. I can give you the number for mental health services in the region if you need.”

“No, that’s okay...” I said, calmer. “Thank you for the offer, though.”

“You’re welcome, sir. Is there anything else I can help you with today?” she asked.

“No, nothing else,” I replied. “Thank you for your time.”

“You’re welcome, stay safe.” she said before hanging up.

I did not buy the gas leak theory at all. I knew that gas leaks could kill people, but there was no way it had the ability to make so many people drop dead at the exact same time. I knew they could cause hallucinations, but everything seemed much too real. I saw the bodies, yes, but I also smelled them. I felt the blood sticking under my shoes. I scrubbed it out of my carpet and spent half an hour trying to get all of it out of the floor of my car. It was there, I knew that. The more I thought about it, the less believable it seemed, but what other explanation was there? What else realistically could have caused that? Mass poisoning? Who would take so much time out of their lives to fill syringes and inject that many people with poison? Plus, their skulls had exploded. Poison did not do that. They would have been throwing up and foaming at the mouth at most, I thought. I was spiraling again.

I decided to run myself a warm bath. As steam filled the room and my skin turned red from the heat of the water, I tried to relax. I closed my eyes, focused on the soft ripples of water against my limbs and tried to breathe in and out slowly.

The next day, my dad called me and invited me to a family dinner. We tried to do those at least twice a month, since my apartment was not too far from the family home. Staying close despite not living together anymore was very important to us. I had always been close to my brothers and both of them were very attached to me. Growing up, they were little menaces. I heard somewhere that twins have a special sort of bond that most people cannot understand or relate to, and that definitely applied to them. It seemed like they shared the same mind, always ready to get in trouble together. They were both eleven years old now and they definitely calmed down over the years, but what linked them had not changed.

I got in my car and arrived half an hour later. I saw Joey noticing my arrival through the window and running towards the front door. It flew open and he jumped out with Sam right behind him. I got out of the car and both of them ran to me and began telling me all about their day and friends they made at school. They were talking over each other so fast that I could barely make out what each of them was saying. Their excitement was contagious.

Joey wore new glasses, but he still looked so alike Sam that, if they were to dress the same, they could easily be mistaken from one another. As little kids, they loved surprising people by switching places and pretending to be the other one. As they grew up, both of them developed their own mannerisms and personalities, so they could not prank the family as easily anymore, but it still worked on strangers.

They began leading me towards the house and I saw both of my parents standing at the door waving at me. Mom had the biggest smile on her face and leaned lovingly against my dad who had his arm around her waist. I walked up the steps and they wrapped me in their arms. It always felt so good to be home.

“I’m so glad you’re home, honey!” my mom began. “I hope the drive went well?”

“I missed you, mom,” I responded. “There was barely anyone on the road.”

She rubbed my back, like she had done ever since I was a child.

“Ready to eat, bud?” my dad asked. “The food’s almost ready.”

“You know I’m always hungry for mom’s food.” I replied with a chuckle.

My mom’s food was the best. Every meal she cooked was perfect and absolutely delicious. Sam and Joey dragged me to the living room, where they showed me a new video game dad had bought for them. They handed me a controller and begged me to play with them. I was never much into video games, so I was pretty bad at it, but it made them laugh and I smiled. All three of us sat on pillows on the ground, my brothers playfully pushing each other with their shoulders trying to make the other lose. I lost the next game, and the one after that too, then mom called us to the kitchen for dinner.

We all sat down around the antique wooden table and mom brought us plates of meat and potatoes covered with brown sauce. It was a comforting meal I had the pleasure to eat all through my childhood. Dad brought forks and apple juice to the table for my brothers, then asked mom and I if we would like some coffee, which I accepted gratefully. What I liked the most about eating with my family was that the table never got silent. With five people sitting together, there was always a conversation going. Between two bites, Sam brought up the park they went to the day before.

“The squirrels were huge!” he said.

“It was a dog park!” Joey added. “I saw so many! There was this little tiny one and a huge German shepherd!”

“Mom?” Sam asked. “Can we have a dog?”

Mom and dad looked at each other, silently trying to guess what the other thought. My brothers never had a dog growing up. I have vague memories of my parents and I having a fluffy white dog when I was very young, but I was their only child back then.

“Do you think we’d have enough space in the house for a dog?” mom asked my dad.

“I’m not sure, Sylvia.” dad answered. “I think we could give it a try.”

My brothers screamed in unison and began cheering and clapping their hands.

“We’ll have a dog! We’ll have a dog!” they screamed together.

“But!” dad interrupted. “You’ll have to take care of it. I’ll show you how. Dogs aren’t toys, they’re living animals and they can be a lot of work.”

My brothers calmed down a little bit and tried to contain their voices, but I could see the excited glances they threw at each other.

“The house is gonna blow up into a storm,” mom chuckled.

I smiled and kept eating. My mom absolutely adored animals and I knew she had to be as excited as my brothers at the idea of having a dog. I could see sparkles in her eyes when she looked up at me.

“The food’s delicious, mom,” I told her.

“Thank you, honey.” she replied. “Oh! I took a video of a funny white dog I saw at the park. Do you want to see it?”

Of course, I accepted. She put down her fork and pulled out her phone. I leaned in towards the screen and she pressed play. The dog had tiny little ears and the rest of its fur made it look like a ball of snow. It was running around a tree, trying to catch a squirrel that was way too fast for it, then gave up when the squirrel climbed up the tree, innocently sitting on the glass and looking up into the leaves.

“It’s a Samoyed, just like we had when you were a kid,” she explained. “Do you remember?”

“Vaguely,” I replied. “I can remember glimpses, but that’s about it.”

The video continued and showed the dog playing with a small Pomeranian. It was careful not to step on the tiny dog. I always loved how smaller dogs were so unaware of their size, ready to face danger and fight anything. My mom joked that they compensated what they lacked in height with their attitude.

The video randomly cut to black and muted itself. My mom frowned, confused, and tapped on the screen a few times, but nothing happened. As she reached forward to pick her phone up, probably about to give it a shake to “try to fix it”, a new sound starting coming from it. The voice. That voice. The one I could now recognize immediately. The one I knew I had to obey. The one I knew *they* had to obey at all costs.

“Simon says...” it began.

All eyes were on the phone, wondering what was happening. I knew what would happen. My face did not reflect confusion like theirs did. It reflected anticipation, worry and fear. I glanced at my dad who, clearly, had not warned my family like I told him to. His eyes were wide open and his mouth was slack jawed as if to say: “You really weren’t kidding...”

“Make a mess!” the voice finished.

I did not even hesitate, did not even consider what my parents would think. I grabbed my plate with both hands and flipped it, sending it flying towards the middle of the table. Potatoes and sauce spilled everywhere and the plate shattered. My parents stared in shock, but my brothers broke the silence.

“Food fight!” Sam screamed.

He grabbed handfuls of mashed potatoes and launched them at Joey’s face, who retaliated, grabbing meat and sending it all over Sam’s clothes. Both of them kept going, frantically throwing food on each other, on the table, against the walls and onto the floor. My dad abruptly turned towards them, opening his mouth to yell, but his elbow caught the handle of his coffee mug and made it fall off the table, shattering as it hit the floor. Mom stood up and walked towards the mess on the floor. She was rarely the one who disciplined my brothers, she was a gentle, caring mother and wife.

“Don’t move, George. I’ll clean it up,” she said. “Be careful, boys. There’s glass everywhere.”

She never reached the broken cup, though. As she was about to take another step forward, she dropped to the floor. For the first time, I got to see what happened when someone did not obey the entity’s orders. I regret it to this day. I saw her eyes pop out of their sockets. I saw fragments of bones be ejected out of her head as the flesh wrapping her skull tore into shreds, loose flaps of skin hanging down with her hair still attached to it. It was instantaneous. Within a second, she was on the floor in a pool of her own blood. It kept flowing, spreading on the kitchen tile, leaking on the grout separating them like a macabre river. Her body did not convulse or twitch like I though it would. It was still as a rock, still as death. She was face down with her twisted limbs by her side.

“Mom!” Joey screamed as he turned towards the floor. “Mom, are you okay?!”

Sam’s mouth opened, but no sound came out. I was pretty sure that he had not seen what I saw. Tears formed in his eyes and rapidly began to fall on his shirt as he kept opening and closing his mouth, trying to find words. My dad stood from his chair so fast that he sent it falling backwards.

“Get your brothers out of the kitchen!” he ordered. “I’ll call an ambulance.”

I did as he said. I stood up, vision blurred by the tears. I did not speak, not able to say anything. I walked up to my brothers and put a hand on each of their shoulders. They stood up, Sam with stiff limbs and shaking knees, but Joey kept screaming. He protested, tried to fight me to stay in the kitchen, but ultimately let himself be brought to his room. I gently pushed both of them in Joey’s room and shut the door.

“Just... Just wait here,” I said. “Dad and I will take care of mom, okay?”

I walked back to the kitchen, bracing myself to see her body a second time. I could hear Sam sobbing, while Joey wailed and screamed questions I had no answer for. Dad had propped mom up so she looked like she was sitting. Her back was on dad’s lap, with her head on his chest. He stared into what remained of her face and ran his hands through her sticky, bloody hair. Chunks of it were coming out and getting stuck to his fingers.

“Sylvia... Sylvia, please,” he begged. “No... Please.”

I could not do anything. I was unsure of what to say and I knew that, no matter what I said, it would not make the situation better. Nothing I could have said or done would have helped. I walked up to my dad and kneeled beside him, silent. He looked at me with wide, tear-filled eyes, begging for an explanation, to understand, begging for a reason. Shaking my head slowly was the only answer I managed to give him. I just cried silently and avoided looking at mom’s face.

“You were right...” he just said in disbelief. “You were... What you said, it was true...”

I did not respond, I did not know what to say.

“But how...” he kept going. “How?”

“I don’t know... I have no idea,” I simply replied.

I had no better explanation, and I felt guilty for it, like I was letting him down. I did not know why it had to be this way, if god was punishing us, if hell was descending on earth or if this was all a weird fucking mind virus. I did not know, but I knew that mom was dead and that my brothers would need to grow up without a mother, raised by a dad who lost half of his heart right in front of his eyes.

The ambulance came and took mom away from us. Dad got in with her and left me at home to care for my brothers. I tried in vain to comfort them for hours. Sam cried himself to sleep, but Joey screamed until his voice gave out and his throat became raw, then he just stared endlessly at the ceiling. I sat in the living room and watched my cup of coffee become cold while I waited for dad to return. One hour turned to two, then three, then four. I stared at the black TV screen, unable and unwilling to turn it on.

Dad came back home at some point. It was the middle of the night and he looked terrible to say the least. He said that, to keep it short, there would be no police investigation. Foul play was ruled out pretty much instantly. The wound in her head had clearly been caused from the inside and there was no way any of us could have caused it. The coroner consulted the doctors, but in the end, none of them really knew for sure what had caused it. So we were left in the dark while they kept mom’s body. They told my dad that they would keep working until they found an explanation, but I doubted they would find one.

I spent the two weeks following the event being a useless mess in my apartment. I did not talk to anybody, did not go out, did not play games nor watch movies, nothing. I was barely conscious, barely alive. I called my girlfriend once to tell her that my mother died, she was rightfully heartbroken. She offered to join me at my apartment to keep me company, but I politely refused.

Mom’s funeral came and I wore a black suit I bought for the occasion. Dad and my brothers did the same. We had not seen each other since the day mom died, but no heartwarming smiles were exchanged that day. No laughs, no jokes and no banter from my brothers either. We hugged each other when we got there, but it was different, too different. It felt forced, like we knew we would burst into tears if we really leaned into it. My brothers were already tearing up before we even entered the building and I saw that dad was trying to stay strong for them. I could see his eyelids twitching, as if he was trying to contain tears. I had never seen my dad cry before that day. He was a strong, loving husband. He was a pillar you could always lean onto when you needed help. He had the advice, the stability and the strength of a king. Even during the hardest period of his life, he still tried to represent that role, but I knew. I knew that, under the cover, behind the mask, he was struggling.

He put his hand behind my back as we entered the funeral home, and I did the same for him. I did not want dad to feel like he was alone. His other hand went on Joey’s shoulder and mine went on Sam’s. We walked down the aisle between family members and old friends of my mom. I pretended to ignore the whispers, forced myself not to listen to them. I did not want to know what they had to say, their theories, the rumors, the lies. We sat down together in the four empty chairs waiting for us in the front row.

A middle-aged woman I had never seen before walked on the little podium and began the ceremony. She wore a long-sleeved dress and spoke in a solemn voice.

“We unite here today,” she began. “To not only mourn the loss of a mother, wife and friend, but to celebrate her life, her achievements and the beauty of her soul.”

She kept speaking, but I had trouble listening. It felt like I was stuck in a terrible dream. Once she was done speaking, my brothers and I stood up and each stood on a different side of the casket. We held our respective candle while the woman lit them and, once a soft music began playing, we slowly marched up to the casket. We held the candles in front of our chests and closed our eyes. I could not bear facing the teary eyes of the audience, but I briefly met my dad’s eyes. It was a mistake. My knees began to shake and I shut my eyes tightly in a silent prayer. I heard my brothers sniffling, trying to hold in their cries. After we opened our eyes, I risked a glance at mom. She was covered by a white sheet, so I could not see her. I wondered what I would see under it, what she would look like. We sat down the candles and made our way back to our chairs, where dad was quietly sobbing.

A pastor came in next and led a prayer. Our family had never been very religious, but we believed in God. At least, at first I did. Now, after what I had seen, I was not so sure anymore. I felt like I was betraying our beliefs, but I also felt like our beliefs were betraying us themselves. The prayer was beautiful. The pastor was confident, compassionate and polite. He carried his voice through the whole room perfectly and seemed to enchant everyone with his words. “Mom will be okay,” I thought. “The angels will take care of her and so will grandma and grandpa.”

Then came the hardest part. The last person who was going to speak to us was going to be my dad. He pulled out a folded paper from his pocket, steadied himself and stood up. Like an unshakeable statue, he walked on the stage, brave as he always had been. He positioned himself behind the podium, sat his paper down onto it, and leaned towards the microphone. I heard him inhale shakily, then he began reading.

“Thank you for allowing me to speak today. I want to thank our friends and family for coming, I know that Sylvia would have appreciated it greatly. I also know that she would be heartbroken to see the sadness you all have to bear today.” he started.

He paused for a second, then kept going.

“Sylvia was, is, and will forever be the love of my life. Together, we lived a life I could not have asked more from. Together, we raised the most beautiful, brave children I have ever seen. Together, we braved storms, problems and fears. But you know who never gave up? Sylvia. No matter how things were, no matter how scared I knew she was, Sylvia was the voice of hope. Sylvia was the one who always kept believing. She was the light of our lives, no matter what she faced. That’s how great of a woman she was,” he continued.

Everyone was crying by that point. Most people were doing so silently, but some were openly sobbing. My brothers leaned closer to me and I squeezed each of their shoulders. I was not trying to contain the tears anymore, I let them fall freely.

“I know that Sylvia would be satisfied with the life she led, as much as I am. I am saddened to know that she will never... get to see our little boys become men. She will never get to see our brave young man, Jack, grow old. At least, not from earth. But I believe that, from Heaven, she will watch over us all, cheering us on to keep going, to stay strong,” he said.

I struggled to breathe, like the air was getting stuck in my trachea. I would not be able to be brave for much longer. My brothers’ tears soaked into my suit, but I did not care. “Cry as much as you need,” I thought. “I’m here for you. Your brother’s here for you.” I held them tighter.

“If there is one thing I know Sylvia would say, it would be this. She would say: ‘Stay strong for me. Live a life you know I would be proud of. Stay strong for me, because I will always keep you safe from heaven.’ Sylvia was and will always be the greatest woman I got the chance to share my life with and I am grateful for every single second we spent together.”

My dad wiped the tears from his face and folded the wet paper, before putting it back into his pocket. We clapped quietly and offered weak smiles for his strength and his words. Clapping any louder would have felt disrespectful.

Before the ceremony ended, the woman from earlier walked up to the casket and removed the sheet from mom and folded it onto her lap. Dad, my brothers and I were invited to walk up to her and say our last words. We approached the casket cautiously, like we desperately wanted to see her but were also terrified of what we would see.

Her body wore her favourite light blue dress. It was strange, seeing her so pale and still. I always heard that dead people in caskets looked like they were sleeping, but I disagreed. She looked too still. The sight in front of me made me all too aware that her body was now nothing but an empty vessel of flesh. It was distressing. I shifted my gaze from her dress to her face, apprehensively. Her face looked wrong too. Her features were all slightly different, just enough to give me an unpleasant feeling. I could see bits of the device holding her jaw closed and the ends of the stitches sewing her eyelids shut. My guess is that, since her eyes had popped out of their sockets, there was no way to make them look right without stitching her eyelids close. They had shaved her hair, though we could not see the top of her head. They had covered it with some sort of scarf that matched her dress, but a small part of her scalp was visible above her forehead. Her skull must have been so disfigured that there was no way they could leave her head uncovered, but I knew. I knew what it looked like, and I could not stop picturing it in my mind.

My brothers mumbled their last words while my dad kept his hand on my mother’s cold arm, sniffling. The only other sound audible was a prayer played on a speaker just quietly enough that those near the casket could hear.

“Out father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name,” it began, but it got interrupted. “Simon says... Laugh.”

We knew we had to. We knew what would happen if we did not do it. For a split second, my heavy heart thought that maybe, just maybe, I should ignore it. Maybe I should stay still and wait for it to bring me back to mom. I shook the idea out of my head. I needed to be there for my brothers. I needed to be there for dad. I needed to live. Dad is the one who started. He let out a hesitant, quiet chuckle. I followed and nudged my brother with my elbows, a silent way to tell them to obey. We hoped that the audience could not hear and that, if they did, they would believe it to be nervous laughter. I hoped it would be enough to satisfy the entity. I hoped it would count. I did not know if it would, and I was scared. I think my dad had the same thought, because then he said:

“God... Imagine if she saw how pitiful we look right now.”

Loud enough for the audience to hear. So we laughed. We really laughed. It was not even forced, because we knew he was right. I knew that mom would want us to be strong and keep living. She would not want us to cry, but she would understand. The prayer resumed on the speaker, and we let out shaky sighs.

We held each other’s hands and, together, we said: “I love you, mom.” Then, we turned and left the funeral home, leaving the other guests behind. My dad asked if I wanted to come spend some time at his house until I felt better, but I declined his offer. I doubted I would be able to stand the sight of the kitchen, or the house in general. I did not want to remember how I had to mop up the blood and pick up the fragments of bones. I drove home and cried until I had no tears left. That night, I dreamed of my favourite memories of mom. It was the best dream I ever had.

i know that there was a cat cafe on the west end pre covid, and i’m not sure of why it closed. i visited it once in 2019 and enjoyed my time there. i know that cat lovers tend to visit a cat cafe as a novelty if they’re visiting a town that has one, but what about longevity?

the idea is using locally roasted coffee + as many locally sourced/house made ingredients as possible (i know we hate sysco) and serving breakfast and lunch items and beer + wine. unsure of what closing hours would look like. of course the cat area and food area would be separated. 

the goal would be for food and beverage to be of a quality that’s high enough that people who don’t even like cats would want to stop by for lunch, coffee, or an afternoon break treat. 

local art + other small, local vendors would have their items for sale

cost for only coming to visit the cats would be a recommended donation of a few dollars. 

cats/kittens would be sourced through the humane society and would be available for adoption

i love the idea of a cat cafe in greenville for a handful of reasons 
- an inexpensive activity for any age
- a hub for local vendors and artists to sell/advertise
- food and beverage that focuses on what’s local and homemade 
- shelters need more places for cats and kittens. this would open up space for 15 or more cats and kittens 
- increased adoption rate since it would be in a high traffic area

this has been a years long dream of mine, and i’ve been able to meet with an investor, but he wants a business plan. i have more details worked out, but i want to hear the public’s opinion on how this might be accepted. ",5,1764991035.0,greenville,21,0.69,False

26 'And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?'"" (John 11:25-26) 

Jesus says something here that most of us don't hear from any other source.  I think we humans are geared to search for answers to spiritual questions.  We're prone to seek truth outside ourselves because we know we don't have it all.  It's human nature to look to an earthly parent-figure for answers if we were raised by people who seemed to ""have it all together."" But our Messiah tells us, ""Call no man on earth 'father,' for one is your Father, He who is in heaven -- and you are all brothers. And do not be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Messiah."" ([Matthew 23:9-10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/mat/23/9-10/s_952009), [Jeremiah 3:19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jer/3/19/s_748019))

Life is a classroom. The lesson God wants to each us is how to live forever, in unity with Him and each other. Unfortunately, humanity without God either accepts death as part of life, or tries to find ways to live forever for selfish or pointless reasons. We have to look for answers from a teacher we want to emulate. Jesus showed us that He knew how to live forever by rising from the dead. He showed us how to make eternal life worth living with His teachings and His love. We aspire, as Enoch did, to learn to walk with God and become His eternal children.

Knowing who to learn from is of limited value if we think we already know what's being taught, and rush through our lessons. We've all heard ""love your neighbor as yourself,"" but how many of us love ourselves enough to make healthy choices all the time?  How often is my neighbor's emergency as high a priority as my own?  
We have to admit it when we're in the dark -- not just as an admission to ourselves, but to those who depend on us.  Facing our human insufficiency together lets us reach out to our Savior in unity.  ""Wherever two or three are gathered, there I am in their midst.""  ([Matthew 18:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/mat/18/20/s_947020), [Malachi 3:16-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mal/3/16-17/s_928017))  I didn't realize how powerful this was until my grown son said the best thing I did as a parent was to tell him that someday he would figure out that I'm not perfect, and that I hoped he still loved me when it happened. 

I'm blessed by Charles Spurgeon's interpretation of Jesus' parable, The Pearl of Great Price. He said that for Jesus, we humans were the pearls of great price and the hidden treasure that Jesus gave up everything for.  When we truly appreciate the depth of suffering Messiah went through for us, it changes our hearts. He becomes our Pearl; our greatest pursuit in life.  He's worth everything we give up so we can be His hands and feet to the world.  I could barely give up a cup of coffee for the sake of a higher good when the Lord blessed me with this truth.  I'm thankful He doesn't leave us like He finds us!  ([Luke 14:27-33](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/luk/14/27-33/s_987030), [Romans 12:1-2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/rom/12/1-2/s_1058002), [Ezekiel 16:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/eze/16/6/s_818006))  

I don't know how Jesus does it, but His parables keep me on track so I can draw closer and closer to Him.  When we, like the pearl merchant, give up worldly pursuits to have Jesus, for awhile, we have nothing but our precious Pearl.  Without our creature comforts, we find ourselves in the lowest earthly room at the wedding feast of His word. ([Job 23:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/job/23/12/s_459012), [Psalm 100:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/psa/100/3/s_578003), [John 1:1-4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jhn/1/1-4/s_998001), [John 1:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jhn/1/14/s_998014), [John 6:35](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jhn/6/35/s_1003035), [Song 2:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/sng/2/4/s_673004))

I was sitting at my kitchen table with my laptop in front of me one afternoon, since I had chosen to work from home. I would have surely gone insane if I had to sit in a stale, boring office for hours while taking calls from angry customers screaming about their car insurance. It was already boring enough as it was. I sighed, pulled my laptop closer to the edge of my kitchen table and put my headphones back on, ready to take another call. While a man told me about an issue he was having with his insurance company, I began to hear faint static in the background. It got progressively louder, to the point where the man’s voice became inaudible. Within the sound, I heard a low distorted voice that made me tense up. I knew what was coming.

“Simon says... Insult your customer,” it said.

I could almost distinguish hidden amusement in the voice, like it enjoyed playing with my life. I took a deep breath, knowing I had no choice.

“God, you suck!” I exclaimed.

It was all I could come up with under the pressure. Immediately, all sound cut off and the man’s voice came back.

“What the fuck did you say?!” he screamed.

“Sorry, sir!” I said. “My cat jumped on my keyboard.”

The man sighed, said he would call somewhere else, and hung up. I leaned back on my uncomfortable chair and shut my eyes. I felt embarrassed, but relieved that I would not end up dead today. I wondered who would have found me first? My girlfriend? My dad? My employer? A series of thoughts kept repeating in my head and anxiety quickly set in. Evidently, the entity that voice came from was not confined to the radio anymore. That fact filled me with a cold dread. I wondered where it would end, what it meant, why it changed. Was it evolving? The rest of my shift was uneventful and, though I was on edge during every call that came next, I managed to help every customer to the best of my abilities.

I desperately wanted to understand what was truly happening. I had to know what was causing all of this. I was afraid, constantly unnerved and the endless spiral of anxiety-induced thoughts kept me awake way too late at night. My previous research had been less than helpful, so I knew I had to take a different approach this time. I thought about turning on the news, but decided against it.

Instead, I decided to call the non emergency police line. My expectations were not high, but I was hopeful that they could at least give me some information. I picked up my phone and dialed the number.

“Non-emergency police, this is Isabel speaking,” the woman on the other side of the phone said. “Who am I speaking with?”

“Hi, my name is Jack,” I answered.

“Alright. Jack,” she said. “How can I help you today?”

“Well...” I began but I was already trailing off. “I was wondering if you knew what was going on with the whole ‘Simon says’ radio voice and everything. You know, with what happened at the grocery store...”

Isabel stayed silent for a few seconds before speaking again.

“I’m sorry, sir, I’m not allowed to divulge any information on the matter at the moment,” she said more sternly. “The event is still under investigation and hasn’t been made public yet.”

“Please,” I almost begged. “Please, I just want to know... I’m scared, I just want to understand.”

“I’m sorry, sir,” she repeated. “As I said, the investigation hasn’t been made public yet and...”

“Please!” I was practically screaming into the phone by that point. “I was there! I saw the bodies, the blood, I saw them all dead in front of me! All of them! I just need to know! I need to know, so I can sleep at night. I can barely sleep, I keep having nightmares. I see them in my dreams, in my head, all the time. I keep remembering what they looked like...”

“Alright, alright, Jack. Listen,” she interrupted me, her voice softer now. “All I can say is that we think it was probably caused by a gas leak. It seems like the most likely explanation. I can’t say anything else, telling you more could get me in career-ending trouble. Now, I recommend that you seek professional mental health help. I can give you the number for mental health services in the region if you need.”

“No, that’s okay...” I said, calmer. “Thank you for the offer, though.”

“You’re welcome, sir. Is there anything else I can help you with today?” she asked.

“No, nothing else,” I replied. “Thank you for your time.”

“You’re welcome, stay safe.” she said before hanging up.

I did not buy the gas leak theory at all. I knew that gas leaks could kill people, but there was no way it had the ability to make so many people drop dead at the exact same time. I knew they could cause hallucinations, but everything seemed much too real. I saw the bodies, yes, but I also smelled them. I felt the blood sticking under my shoes. I scrubbed it out of my carpet and spent half an hour trying to get all of it out of the floor of my car. It was there, I knew that. The more I thought about it, the less believable it seemed, but what other explanation was there? What else realistically could have caused that? Mass poisoning? Who would take so much time out of their lives to fill syringes and inject that many people with poison? Plus, their skulls had exploded. Poison did not do that. They would have been throwing up and foaming at the mouth at most, I thought. I was spiraling again.

I decided to run myself a warm bath. As steam filled the room and my skin turned red from the heat of the water, I tried to relax. I closed my eyes, focused on the soft ripples of water against my limbs and tried to breathe in and out slowly.

The next day, my dad called me and invited me to a family dinner. We tried to do those at least twice a month, since my apartment was not too far from the family home. Staying close despite not living together anymore was very important to us. I had always been close to my brothers and both of them were very attached to me. Growing up, they were little menaces. I heard somewhere that twins have a special sort of bond that most people cannot understand or relate to, and that definitely applied to them. It seemed like they shared the same mind, always ready to get in trouble together. They were both eleven years old now and they definitely calmed down over the years, but what linked them had not changed.

I got in my car and arrived half an hour later. I saw Joey noticing my arrival through the window and running towards the front door. It flew open and he jumped out with Sam right behind him. I got out of the car and both of them ran to me and began telling me all about their day and friends they made at school. They were talking over each other so fast that I could barely make out what each of them was saying. Their excitement was contagious.

Joey wore new glasses, but he still looked so alike Sam that, if they were to dress the same, they could easily be mistaken from one another. As little kids, they loved surprising people by switching places and pretending to be the other one. As they grew up, both of them developed their own mannerisms and personalities, so they could not prank the family as easily anymore, but it still worked on strangers.

They began leading me towards the house and I saw both of my parents standing at the door waving at me. Mom had the biggest smile on her face and leaned lovingly against my dad who had his arm around her waist. I walked up the steps and they wrapped me in their arms. It always felt so good to be home.

“I’m so glad you’re home, honey!” my mom began. “I hope the drive went well?”

“I missed you, mom,” I responded. “There was barely anyone on the road.”

She rubbed my back, like she had done ever since I was a child.

“Ready to eat, bud?” my dad asked. “The food’s almost ready.”

“You know I’m always hungry for mom’s food.” I replied with a chuckle.

My mom’s food was the best. Every meal she cooked was perfect and absolutely delicious. Sam and Joey dragged me to the living room, where they showed me a new video game dad had bought for them. They handed me a controller and begged me to play with them. I was never much into video games, so I was pretty bad at it, but it made them laugh and I smiled. All three of us sat on pillows on the ground, my brothers playfully pushing each other with their shoulders trying to make the other lose. I lost the next game, and the one after that too, then mom called us to the kitchen for dinner.

We all sat down around the antique wooden table and mom brought us plates of meat and potatoes covered with brown sauce. It was a comforting meal I had the pleasure to eat all through my childhood. Dad brought forks and apple juice to the table for my brothers, then asked mom and I if we would like some coffee, which I accepted gratefully. What I liked the most about eating with my family was that the table never got silent. With five people sitting together, there was always a conversation going. Between two bites, Sam brought up the park they went to the day before.

“The squirrels were huge!” he said.

“It was a dog park!” Joey added. “I saw so many! There was this little tiny one and a huge German shepherd!”

“Mom?” Sam asked. “Can we have a dog?”

Mom and dad looked at each other, silently trying to guess what the other thought. My brothers never had a dog growing up. I have vague memories of my parents and I having a fluffy white dog when I was very young, but I was their only child back then.

“Do you think we’d have enough space in the house for a dog?” mom asked my dad.

“I’m not sure, Sylvia.” dad answered. “I think we could give it a try.”

My brothers screamed in unison and began cheering and clapping their hands.

“We’ll have a dog! We’ll have a dog!” they screamed together.

“But!” dad interrupted. “You’ll have to take care of it. I’ll show you how. Dogs aren’t toys, they’re living animals and they can be a lot of work.”

My brothers calmed down a little bit and tried to contain their voices, but I could see the excited glances they threw at each other.

“The house is gonna blow up into a storm,” mom chuckled.

I smiled and kept eating. My mom absolutely adored animals and I knew she had to be as excited as my brothers at the idea of having a dog. I could see sparkles in her eyes when she looked up at me.

“The food’s delicious, mom,” I told her.

“Thank you, honey.” she replied. “Oh! I took a video of a funny white dog I saw at the park. Do you want to see it?”

Of course, I accepted. She put down her fork and pulled out her phone. I leaned in towards the screen and she pressed play. The dog had tiny little ears and the rest of its fur made it look like a ball of snow. It was running around a tree, trying to catch a squirrel that was way too fast for it, then gave up when the squirrel climbed up the tree, innocently sitting on the glass and looking up into the leaves.

“It’s a Samoyed, just like we had when you were a kid,” she explained. “Do you remember?”

“Vaguely,” I replied. “I can remember glimpses, but that’s about it.”

The video continued and showed the dog playing with a small Pomeranian. It was careful not to step on the tiny dog. I always loved how smaller dogs were so unaware of their size, ready to face danger and fight anything. My mom joked that they compensated what they lacked in height with their attitude.

The video randomly cut to black and muted itself. My mom frowned, confused, and tapped on the screen a few times, but nothing happened. As she reached forward to pick her phone up, probably about to give it a shake to “try to fix it”, a new sound starting coming from it. The voice. That voice. The one I could now recognize immediately. The one I knew I had to obey. The one I knew *they* had to obey at all costs.

“Simon says...” it began.

All eyes were on the phone, wondering what was happening. I knew what would happen. My face did not reflect confusion like theirs did. It reflected anticipation, worry and fear. I glanced at my dad who, clearly, had not warned my family like I told him to. His eyes were wide open and his mouth was slack jawed as if to say: “You really weren’t kidding...”

“Make a mess!” the voice finished.

I did not even hesitate, did not even consider what my parents would think. I grabbed my plate with both hands and flipped it, sending it flying towards the middle of the table. Potatoes and sauce spilled everywhere and the plate shattered. My parents stared in shock, but my brothers broke the silence.

“Food fight!” Sam screamed.

He grabbed handfuls of mashed potatoes and launched them at Joey’s face, who retaliated, grabbing meat and sending it all over Sam’s clothes. Both of them kept going, frantically throwing food on each other, on the table, against the walls and onto the floor. My dad abruptly turned towards them, opening his mouth to yell, but his elbow caught the handle of his coffee mug and made it fall off the table, shattering as it hit the floor. Mom stood up and walked towards the mess on the floor. She was rarely the one who disciplined my brothers, she was a gentle, caring mother and wife.

“Don’t move, George. I’ll clean it up,” she said. “Be careful, boys. There’s glass everywhere.”

She never reached the broken cup, though. As she was about to take another step forward, she dropped to the floor. For the first time, I got to see what happened when someone did not obey the entity’s orders. I regret it to this day. I saw her eyes pop out of their sockets. I saw fragments of bones be ejected out of her head as the flesh wrapping her skull tore into shreds, loose flaps of skin hanging down with her hair still attached to it. It was instantaneous. Within a second, she was on the floor in a pool of her own blood. It kept flowing, spreading on the kitchen tile, leaking on the grout separating them like a macabre river. Her body did not convulse or twitch like I though it would. It was still as a rock, still as death. She was face down with her twisted limbs by her side.

“Mom!” Joey screamed as he turned towards the floor. “Mom, are you okay?!”

Sam’s mouth opened, but no sound came out. I was pretty sure that he had not seen what I saw. Tears formed in his eyes and rapidly began to fall on his shirt as he kept opening and closing his mouth, trying to find words. My dad stood from his chair so fast that he sent it falling backwards.

“Get your brothers out of the kitchen!” he ordered. “I’ll call an ambulance.”

I did as he said. I stood up, vision blurred by the tears. I did not speak, not able to say anything. I walked up to my brothers and put a hand on each of their shoulders. They stood up, Sam with stiff limbs and shaking knees, but Joey kept screaming. He protested, tried to fight me to stay in the kitchen, but ultimately let himself be brought to his room. I gently pushed both of them in Joey’s room and shut the door.

“Just... Just wait here,” I said. “Dad and I will take care of mom, okay?”

I walked back to the kitchen, bracing myself to see her body a second time. I could hear Sam sobbing, while Joey wailed and screamed questions I had no answer for. Dad had propped mom up so she looked like she was sitting. Her back was on dad’s lap, with her head on his chest. He stared into what remained of her face and ran his hands through her sticky, bloody hair. Chunks of it were coming out and getting stuck to his fingers.

“Sylvia... Sylvia, please,” he begged. “No... Please.”

I could not do anything. I was unsure of what to say and I knew that, no matter what I said, it would not make the situation better. Nothing I could have said or done would have helped. I walked up to my dad and kneeled beside him, silent. He looked at me with wide, tear-filled eyes, begging for an explanation, to understand, begging for a reason. Shaking my head slowly was the only answer I managed to give him. I just cried silently and avoided looking at mom’s face.

“You were right...” he just said in disbelief. “You were... What you said, it was true...”

I did not respond, I did not know what to say.

“But how...” he kept going. “How?”

“I don’t know... I have no idea,” I simply replied.

I had no better explanation, and I felt guilty for it, like I was letting him down. I did not know why it had to be this way, if god was punishing us, if hell was descending on earth or if this was all a weird fucking mind virus. I did not know, but I knew that mom was dead and that my brothers would need to grow up without a mother, raised by a dad who lost half of his heart right in front of his eyes.

The ambulance came and took mom away from us. Dad got in with her and left me at home to care for my brothers. I tried in vain to comfort them for hours. Sam cried himself to sleep, but Joey screamed until his voice gave out and his throat became raw, then he just stared endlessly at the ceiling. I sat in the living room and watched my cup of coffee become cold while I waited for dad to return. One hour turned to two, then three, then four. I stared at the black TV screen, unable and unwilling to turn it on.

Dad came back home at some point. It was the middle of the night and he looked terrible to say the least. He said that, to keep it short, there would be no police investigation. Foul play was ruled out pretty much instantly. The wound in her head had clearly been caused from the inside and there was no way any of us could have caused it. The coroner consulted the doctors, but in the end, none of them really knew for sure what had caused it. So we were left in the dark while they kept mom’s body. They told my dad that they would keep working until they found an explanation, but I doubted they would find one.

I spent the two weeks following the event being a useless mess in my apartment. I did not talk to anybody, did not go out, did not play games nor watch movies, nothing. I was barely conscious, barely alive. I called my girlfriend once to tell her that my mother died, she was rightfully heartbroken. She offered to join me at my apartment to keep me company, but I politely refused.

Mom’s funeral came and I wore a black suit I bought for the occasion. Dad and my brothers did the same. We had not seen each other since the day mom died, but no heartwarming smiles were exchanged that day. No laughs, no jokes and no banter from my brothers either. We hugged each other when we got there, but it was different, too different. It felt forced, like we knew we would burst into tears if we really leaned into it. My brothers were already tearing up before we even entered the building and I saw that dad was trying to stay strong for them. I could see his eyelids twitching, as if he was trying to contain tears. I had never seen my dad cry before that day. He was a strong, loving husband. He was a pillar you could always lean onto when you needed help. He had the advice, the stability and the strength of a king. Even during the hardest period of his life, he still tried to represent that role, but I knew. I knew that, under the cover, behind the mask, he was struggling.

He put his hand behind my back as we entered the funeral home, and I did the same for him. I did not want dad to feel like he was alone. His other hand went on Joey’s shoulder and mine went on Sam’s. We walked down the aisle between family members and old friends of my mom. I pretended to ignore the whispers, forced myself not to listen to them. I did not want to know what they had to say, their theories, the rumors, the lies. We sat down together in the four empty chairs waiting for us in the front row.

A middle-aged woman I had never seen before walked on the little podium and began the ceremony. She wore a long-sleeved dress and spoke in a solemn voice.

“We unite here today,” she began. “To not only mourn the loss of a mother, wife and friend, but to celebrate her life, her achievements and the beauty of her soul.”

She kept speaking, but I had trouble listening. It felt like I was stuck in a terrible dream. Once she was done speaking, my brothers and I stood up and each stood on a different side of the casket. We held our respective candle while the woman lit them and, once a soft music began playing, we slowly marched up to the casket. We held the candles in front of our chests and closed our eyes. I could not bear facing the teary eyes of the audience, but I briefly met my dad’s eyes. It was a mistake. My knees began to shake and I shut my eyes tightly in a silent prayer. I heard my brothers sniffling, trying to hold in their cries. After we opened our eyes, I risked a glance at mom. She was covered by a white sheet, so I could not see her. I wondered what I would see under it, what she would look like. We sat down the candles and made our way back to our chairs, where dad was quietly sobbing.

A pastor came in next and led a prayer. Our family had never been very religious, but we believed in God. At least, at first I did. Now, after what I had seen, I was not so sure anymore. I felt like I was betraying our beliefs, but I also felt like our beliefs were betraying us themselves. The prayer was beautiful. The pastor was confident, compassionate and polite. He carried his voice through the whole room perfectly and seemed to enchant everyone with his words. “Mom will be okay,” I thought. “The angels will take care of her and so will grandma and grandpa.”

Then came the hardest part. The last person who was going to speak to us was going to be my dad. He pulled out a folded paper from his pocket, steadied himself and stood up. Like an unshakeable statue, he walked on the stage, brave as he always had been. He positioned himself behind the podium, sat his paper down onto it, and leaned towards the microphone. I heard him inhale shakily, then he began reading.

“Thank you for allowing me to speak today. I want to thank our friends and family for coming, I know that Sylvia would have appreciated it greatly. I also know that she would be heartbroken to see the sadness you all have to bear today.” he started.

He paused for a second, then kept going.

“Sylvia was, is, and will forever be the love of my life. Together, we lived a life I could not have asked more from. Together, we raised the most beautiful, brave children I have ever seen. Together, we braved storms, problems and fears. But you know who never gave up? Sylvia. No matter how things were, no matter how scared I knew she was, Sylvia was the voice of hope. Sylvia was the one who always kept believing. She was the light of our lives, no matter what she faced. That’s how great of a woman she was,” he continued.

Everyone was crying by that point. Most people were doing so silently, but some were openly sobbing. My brothers leaned closer to me and I squeezed each of their shoulders. I was not trying to contain the tears anymore, I let them fall freely.

“I know that Sylvia would be satisfied with the life she led, as much as I am. I am saddened to know that she will never... get to see our little boys become men. She will never get to see our brave young man, Jack, grow old. At least, not from earth. But I believe that, from Heaven, she will watch over us all, cheering us on to keep going, to stay strong,” he said.

I struggled to breathe, like the air was getting stuck in my trachea. I would not be able to be brave for much longer. My brothers’ tears soaked into my suit, but I did not care. “Cry as much as you need,” I thought. “I’m here for you. Your brother’s here for you.” I held them tighter.

“If there is one thing I know Sylvia would say, it would be this. She would say: ‘Stay strong for me. Live a life you know I would be proud of. Stay strong for me, because I will always keep you safe from heaven.’ Sylvia was and will always be the greatest woman I got the chance to share my life with and I am grateful for every single second we spent together.”

My dad wiped the tears from his face and folded the wet paper, before putting it back into his pocket. We clapped quietly and offered weak smiles for his strength and his words. Clapping any louder would have felt disrespectful.

Before the ceremony ended, the woman from earlier walked up to the casket and removed the sheet from mom and folded it onto her lap. Dad, my brothers and I were invited to walk up to her and say our last words. We approached the casket cautiously, like we desperately wanted to see her but were also terrified of what we would see.

Her body wore her favourite light blue dress. It was strange, seeing her so pale and still. I always heard that dead people in caskets looked like they were sleeping, but I disagreed. She looked too still. The sight in front of me made me all too aware that her body was now nothing but an empty vessel of flesh. It was distressing. I shifted my gaze from her dress to her face, apprehensively. Her face looked wrong too. Her features were all slightly different, just enough to give me an unpleasant feeling. I could see bits of the device holding her jaw closed and the ends of the stitches sewing her eyelids shut. My guess is that, since her eyes had popped out of their sockets, there was no way to make them look right without stitching her eyelids close. They had shaved her hair, though we could not see the top of her head. They had covered it with some sort of scarf that matched her dress, but a small part of her scalp was visible above her forehead. Her skull must have been so disfigured that there was no way they could leave her head uncovered, but I knew. I knew what it looked like, and I could not stop picturing it in my mind.

My brothers mumbled their last words while my dad kept his hand on my mother’s cold arm, sniffling. The only other sound audible was a prayer played on a speaker just quietly enough that those near the casket could hear.

“Out father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name,” it began, but it got interrupted. “Simon says... Laugh.”

We knew we had to. We knew what would happen if we did not do it. For a split second, my heavy heart thought that maybe, just maybe, I should ignore it. Maybe I should stay still and wait for it to bring me back to mom. I shook the idea out of my head. I needed to be there for my brothers. I needed to be there for dad. I needed to live. Dad is the one who started. He let out a hesitant, quiet chuckle. I followed and nudged my brother with my elbows, a silent way to tell them to obey. We hoped that the audience could not hear and that, if they did, they would believe it to be nervous laughter. I hoped it would be enough to satisfy the entity. I hoped it would count. I did not know if it would, and I was scared. I think my dad had the same thought, because then he said:

“God... Imagine if she saw how pitiful we look right now.”

Loud enough for the audience to hear. So we laughed. We really laughed. It was not even forced, because we knew he was right. I knew that mom would want us to be strong and keep living. She would not want us to cry, but she would understand. The prayer resumed on the speaker, and we let out shaky sighs.

We held each other’s hands and, together, we said: “I love you, mom.” Then, we turned and left the funeral home, leaving the other guests behind. My dad asked if I wanted to come spend some time at his house until I felt better, but I declined his offer. I doubted I would be able to stand the sight of the kitchen, or the house in general. I did not want to remember how I had to mop up the blood and pick up the fragments of bones. I drove home and cried until I had no tears left. That night, I dreamed of my favourite memories of mom.

1pfet3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1pfet3z/how_to_hack_attractiveness_without_being_hot/,How to hack attractiveness without being hot: science-backed psychology tricks that actually work,"It’s wild how some people walk into a room and instantly become the center of attention, even if they’re not conventionally good-looking. Ever wonder why that happens? Most of us do. Especially in a world where everyone’s busy chasing beauty filters, jawline hacks, or TikTok “hot girl” tips that honestly don’t hold up under real scrutiny (shoutout to those viral ‘how to look more expensive’ reels that… don’t).  

What I’ve found through years of research, plus diving into top psychology books, podcasts, and behavioral studies, is that true attractiveness is less about your face and more about how your presence makes people feel. And there are actual psychological principles behind it.

Let’s break it down. Real talk, no fluff. These are proven ways to level up your perceived attractiveness, no Botox, no Photoshop, no weird TikTok contouring illusions.

### Step 1: Master the “warm + competent” combo

According to Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy in her book Presence, people judge you within seconds based on two things:
- Are you warm?
- Are you competent?

The sweet spot? Being both. This is the science-backed formula behind charisma. If you come across as smart but cold, people will respect you but not like you. If you seem warm but incompetent, you get liked but not trusted. But if you’re both? Suddenly people find you magnetic.

Try these:
- Smile with your eyes (not wide, fake smiles)
- Use people’s names while talking
- Mirror their body language subtly (without mimicking)
- Speak clearly and confidently, but not like you're performing

This is exactly what Olivia Fox Cabane explains in The Charisma Myth (an insanely good read btw, top-tier in leadership psychology). She breaks down how charisma is learnable, not just something people are born with. Game-changing stuff.

### Step 2: Use the Pratfall Effect to your advantage

Crazy but true: Making a small mistake can sometimes make you MORE attractive.

Psychologist Elliot Aronson discovered this weird glitch in the human brain called the Pratfall Effect. Basically, people who are competent but make small, harmless mistakes appear more likable and relatable.

So don’t be the perfect robot. Let people see your human side. Don’t over-edit your photos. Laugh at your awkward moments. Admit you spilled coffee on yourself this morning. It makes you real. And real = hot.

### Step 3: Speak slower, lean back, blink less

Sounds random? It’s not. These are direct psychological cues people associate with confidence and status.

- Slower speech = you’re not rushing to prove yourself  
- Leaning back slightly while talking = you’re relaxed in your presence  
- Blinking less = your nervous system is calm, and others will subconsciously pick up dominance vibes

These micro behaviors were covered in Vanessa Van Edwards’ research (she runs the Science of People lab and her YouTube channel is a goldmine). The difference between “trying to be liked” and “just being” is subtle, but it’s body language-driven.

### Step 4: Trigger “reward system” with your voice

The Journal of Neuroscience published a wild study in 2021 showing that certain vocal tones actually activate the pleasure center in the listener’s brain. Lower vocal tone (not monotone, just less pitchy) sounds more dominant and soothing at the same time.

Use pauses. Let your voice drop at the end of a sentence (not upspeak). Don’t speed up.

Also: Most attractive people have “vocal presence.” They make people want to keep listening. Want to train yours? Search “Julian Treasure TED Talk how to speak so people want to listen.” Pure fire.

### Step 5: Be seen with high social proof

You know what makes someone immediately more attractive? Other people wanting them.

This is called “mate choice copying.” A 2022 study in Evolution and Human Behavior found that people automatically rate you as more attractive if others are perceived to desire you.

Don’t fake it, but get seen in good company. Highlight your social life in a healthy, fun way. Share photos with friends where you’re clearly having a good time. Laugh. Be in the mix. It creates subconscious desirability signals.

Bonus tip: Scent matters. A lot. More than people think. According to Rachel Herz, author of The Scent of Desire, our brain ties scent to memory and attraction even faster than visuals. People literally remember how you smell. Choose a signature fragrance that’s clean, noticeable but not aggressive. (Maison Margiela’s Replica line is a cheat code for this, especially ‘Jazz Club’ or ‘Lazy Sunday Morning’.)

### Step 6: Curate the vibe, not the look

Too many people obsess over “how they look” instead of “how they feel to be around.” Energy is underrated but insanely powerful.

The book Captivate by Vanessa Van Edwards explains how people subconsciously decide how you make them feel within the first 10 seconds. So here’s how to optimize that:

- Calm energy = attractiveness  
- Being curious > being impressive  
- Asking good questions creates chemistry faster than any dating app filter  

Try asking:
- “What’s something you’ve been strangely obsessed with lately?”  
- “What’s a really underrated experience people don’t talk about enough?”  

These spark meaningful convo and make people lowkey crave more of you.

### Step 7: Use these psychology-packed resources to train your energy

Here are must-have tools if you’re serious about leveling up how people perceive you:

- Book: The Power of Charm by Brian Tracy and Ron Arden. This book will make you question everything you think you know about social intelligence. It’s not about being fake. It’s about being intentional. Insanely good read.

- Podcast: Hidden Brain (by Shankar Vedantam). Tons of episodes on behavior, perception, and how we subconsciously judge others. One fav: ""You 2.0: The Halo Effect"" shows how people’s first impression can color all their judgments after.

- YouTube: Charisma on Command. Watch the breakdowns of celebrities like Zendaya or Rihanna, none of them follow the basic “be hot” formula but still exude power and charm. Their video on “How Brad Pitt Commands Respect Without Saying a Word” is next-level.

- App: BeFreed – A personalized audio learning app built by a team from Columbia University and ex-Google AI experts. It turns top psychology books, expert talks, and research papers into adaptive podcast-style lessons based on your goals and vibe. I use it to go deep on topics like confidence, voice training, and social fluency while doing chores or commuting. You can even choose the voice and depth (I switch between a 10-minute summary and a 40-minute deep dive depending on my energy). It’s helped me replace scrolling time with actual growth, and I’ve noticed way less brain fog and way better flow in convos.

- App: Finch – Self Care Pet. Don’t sleep on this one. It gamifies habit-building by creating an emotional connection with a virtual pet, but more importantly, it gets you to consistently reflect on your mood, confidence, and goals. Gets your inner game right. And that inner glow? It shows.

- Bonus: Insight Timer app for voice development and breathwork. It seems like a meditation app, but dig deeper and you’ll find voice relaxation sessions that help with tonality, expression, and presence. Your voice literally becomes smoother and more magnetic.

Turns out, attractiveness is way more psychological than visual. Change how you move, speak, and respond, and people start feeling some type of way around you, even if they can’t explain it.",1,1764990695.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

I’ve been thinking about cutting off a friend because they do stuff like this all the time (amongst other things), and it gives me terrible whiplash.

For example, today I offered to give them a ride to class because their foot was hurting. I also got a big haircut, something I’ve been talking about for months and something they know was really important to me. When I got to their place and they got in the car, they barely said hi. They just complained about needing a coffee. They didn’t acknowledge my haircut at all. We spent almost the entire ride in silence. When we got to campus, they just said they were going to get a coffee and walked away. No “thank you” for the ride, no comment on my haircut, nothing.

Later in class, everyone complimented my hair. I thought maybe then they’d say something, but they didn’t. I finally worked up the courage to ask if they really weren’t going to say anything, or if they didn’t think it was cute. They made a face like I was being annoying and just said, “Yeah, it’s cute,” and walked away.

You’d think maybe they were mad at me, but then later that night they texted me about their day like they weren’t super distant a few hours earlier. And it’s not just today, this is a pattern. One moment they say they love spending time with me and that I’m important to them, and the next moment they make me feel like I’m a burden just because I appreciate some basic validation.

Like… what happened to “hello,” “thank you,” or just consistent kindness? I’m not asking them to kiss my ass. I just want a friend who’s steady, who acknowledges things, and who, if they’re having a bad day, can at least revisit the moment later and say something. Instead, they act this way, move on, and later give me the “I enjoy spending time with you” speech.

And honestly, I don’t even know how to bring this up to them. They say something like, “Oh, this throws you off because you haven’t known me for long,” even though I’ve known them for three years. Or they’ll make me feel like I’m taking things too personally. But isn’t this basic stuff you do for people you care about? Am I just attention-starved and needing too much validation? I don’t know if I’m in the wrong here, but I just know that I feel awful, and I’m not sure how much longer I can deal with this.",0,1764990644.0,AmIOverreacting,9,0.5,False

Sophomore year of college, I was assigned my roommate, “Amy”. At first we got along great, respectful of each other’s schedules, we’d even meet for lunch at the student union, no problems. 

But then eventually there was the smell. She showered every day so I wasn’t really sure what it was. Eventually I started noticing little things like she’d throw leftover shrimp Alfredo into a garbage can with no liner and no top. And that would reek. I’d say something and she’d take care of it. 

But it just got worse and worse. Like she’d only take care of stuff if I mentioned it. She had a coffee pot under her bed that was just full of mold and she never cleaned it. And then I started smelling this sour smell as well and it was her socks because until that point I didn’t realize that she really didn’t ever do laundry. 

Then she got a boyfriend whose feet smelled like death. The stench in my room was nauseating; I was sitting outside in the hallway talking to my long distance boyfriend on the phone and the people walking by were like “omg wtf is that smell” and I’d reply “that’s my room” - and would point inside to the two stinky people. 

It got to the point where I couldn’t take in a deep breath between the rotting food, nasty feet, moldy whatever, and I started sleeping in my best friend’s room down the hall, per her invitation. 

Apparently that was a no-no because I got a request from the RD to come talk to her and saying I can’t just abandon my room. I told her it smells. She said she knew, and that she wouldn’t even go in there. Ok, so you expect me to SLEEP in there?

RD said she understood but my only option was to officially change rooms. I think it was pretty unfair that *I* was the one that had to leave, but whatever. I eventually moved to another room with someone with an opening. We met each other and I told her why I was moving rooms. I was bringing my stuff in and new roommate was like OMG you weren’t kidding, LITERALLY ALL OF MY BELONGINGS STUNK. 

So I did a shitload of laundry, spent the rest of the year with a very clean fun roommate; she actually introduced me to much of the music I still love today. We had a great rapport and I’m sad I lost touch with her. Amongst all the smelly bs with Amy, I’m at least grateful for a new friendship that it brought me which wouldn’t have happened otherwise.

1pfeoeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1pfeoeh/aita_for_agreeing_to_get_coffee_with_my_ex_while/,AITA for agreeing to get coffee with my ex while dating someone else?,"February of this year, my long distance ex (25f) and I (27m) broke up after 2 and a half years of dating. It was amicable and we talked it through and talked about if we could be friends still. In May, she was in town so we hung out a little bit and I admit it was like nothing had changed, but I think a month after that, we had both fully moved on and accepted it. Since then, I haven’t reached out, it’s mainly been her every couple months that texts about something random. But I don’t see the harm in catching up and talking about random stuff every now and then. We both want each other to be successful and happy and I think the relationship we have now is very platonic.

Fast forward to August, I started seeing and dating someone new (30f). I told my ex that I had started dating again and she said she was happy for me, so she is aware. Now a few months into this relationship, I love this girl. I do my best to show her that I love her and that I prioritize her. I 100% see a future with her and I look forward to seeing her every day. My ex texted me the other day that she was going to be in town around Christmas and asked if I wanted to just grab coffee. I asked my current gf if she would be okay with that and she initially said yes so I agreed to go. I thought it would be good to keep things friendly and just catch up. I personally don’t see the harm in just grabbing coffee.

However, later that day, she brought up how she actually didn’t like that. We have had several discussions about our perspectives on it. From what I remember, my main point is that I don’t see the harm in it. My ex probably is in town twice a year at most and I think over time, the frequency that we “talk” and she asks me to get coffee will wane until the point where we may not talk at all anymore. Her perspective is that there could be residual feelings that get brought back up when we hang out, that she does not know how often she will be in town and how long she will keep asking to get coffee or so. I’ve tried to show that it’s purely platonic and I don’t have any residual feelings. I know I have fully moved on and I think she has too. However when she asked why I feel the need to agree to get coffee, I didn’t have a great answer. To me, it’s just to be friendly and to catch up, but the follow up question was why do I need to act friendly if I think we will eventually just stop talking all together.

She said she’s fine with me getting coffee this time, but she wouldn’t want me to get coffee in the future, for this to be the last time I ever see my ex in person. I really do care about this girl and how she feels. I agreed I would do that, but today when we talked about it some more, I just feel like absolute shit. Even tho the coffee meet up is probably a month from now, I can feel the tension in our relationship and I don’t like that. I think the only way to resolve it is to just cancel the coffee meet up all together and tell my ex I can’t see her anymore. AITA?",2,1764990289.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

Hi there!  
My name is Jay, I’m 33 years old and originally from Korea, but I’m currently living in North New Jersey (Fort Lee).  I’m hoping to meet someone new who shares similar interests and values.

A bit about me: I’m really into technology — things like computers, cell phones, and electronics in general. I also love gaming, movies, anime, photography, taking walks in parks, and of course, coffee. I used to work as an uncertified barista at a small café, and I still enjoy making coffee to this day.  Whiskey lover and pizza lover. My height is 5'8 / 173cm with around 143lbs. 

When it comes to relationships, I value respect, wisdom, and kindness. I believe that a person’s small actions and words often reveal how they grew up and what kind of heart they have.

Physically, I’m generally attracted to someone who’s slim, petite, or of average build, but that’s just a personal preference — never meant to judge or exclude anyone.

 I’m not sure how lucky I’ll be, but I want to give it a try. Hopefully, I’ll meet someone genuine and warm-hearted.

Lately, I've been struggling with brain fog and fatigue, finding it hard to focus on even a single page without getting sidetracked. I've tried taking modafinil twice before, but it didn't work for me. This time around, I took 400 mg and felt a significant boost—I managed to get through a 200-page course in just an hour! However, I couldn't sleep that night. 

  
The following day, I opted for 300 mg, thinking it might not be effective, so I added coffee, green tea, piracetam, and tyrosine since I had a test coming up. That day was intense; I really experienced anxiety and stress for the first time, feeling overwhelmed and constantly worried. On the day of the test, I took only 200 mg and had coffee on an empty stomach, which made my anxiety spike again. 

  
I'm looking for suggestions on what I can take alongside modafinil to help manage my anxiety. I really don’t want to stop using it because I feel it could transform my life as a student and finally allow me to study effectively. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

This morning I had a protein smoothie for breakfast and left the house to go pole dancing. Very intense class, following that I could feel I needed to eat something but struggled to pick from where outside. 
After the class, I went to pick up my toddler from daycare (lowkey starving) and then realised I had a dentist appointment in 20 and I wouldn’t manage to go home. 

On the way I looked at every shop but no options. Went home kinda 2pm. (Smoothie at 8:30am) by the time I was home I grabbed 180gr of salmon. Ate it and was literally so hungry, tried to wait like 2-5 minutes to see if I could chill a bit but I was very hungry. 
Ate half an avocado, 6 Christmas cookies and a coffee with milk. (Mind you it was 2 cookies in the beggining but I literally was so hungry plus my toddler shouting he wanted more 

Then 2 hours later, had one banana and the other half of the avocado (felt like I wanted food still so ate that before feeling hungrier). 

Now 2 hours after that I had a yogurt bowl with blueberries and like 20gr of oats. I could barely eat that, but is like inside me I was hungry. 

Thennnnn, full on bloating as in 7 months pregnant. And now insane heartburn.

1pfecrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hellenism/comments/1pfecrh/thoughts_on_eating_offerings_in_hellenic/,Thoughts on eating offerings in Hellenic polytheism,"TL;DR:

In Hellenic polytheism, offerings are about giving, not reclaiming. Eating what you offered transforms a gift into self consumption and defeats the point of ritual reciprocity. Claims that offerings are ""wasteful"" often misunderstand or distort the nature of devotion. By that logic, every devotional act would be waste. Modern conditions generally make small offerings easier, not less meaningful. People can use votives or personal devotional acts if they can't offer food. Much of the online disagreement comes from conflating reconstructionist, revivalist, and eclectic approaches, with different goals and different frameworks rather than interchangeable practices.

——

In Hellenic practice, consuming an offering after you've given it is basically the same as making a plate for a friend and then pulling it back to eat yourself in front of them, or giving someone a gift and then taking it back once the moment passes. Who in your life would you say ""this is for you"" only to reclaim it?

Once you take it back, it's no longer a gift, only a performance. The meaning of giving depends entirely on the fact that you don't retrieve the thing you just gave.

The whole meaning of an offering is the act of giving, of surrendering something that was yours into a relationship that is not only about your convenience. If you hand it over and then reclaim it, you haven't offered something. You just moved it around and called it ""devotion"" after the fact. It defeats the entire purpose of offering.

(Household offerings work this way, they're not the same as public animal sacrifice, where part was burned for the gods and part was cooked and shared by the community. These are separate ritual categories. More on this at the end.)

And this is why the ""it's wasteful"" framing lands so strangely to me. An offering is not waste in the way throwing something away is waste. Waste is using a resource with no purpose. An offering is using a resource for a purposeful, sacred function. The point isn't that the gods need the food or the drink as calories, nobody serious about this believes the divine is hungry in a literal biological sense. The point is that the act of giving is the ritualized expression of relationship and reciprocity: I give, I acknowledge, I honor, I place something of value that no longer belongs to me as a gesture of respect and alignment with the divine order I am engaging with.

Once you define ""waste"" as ""anything given away that could have been used for human consumption,"" the logic doesn't stop at food and drink. It collapses the entire practice of worship. By that standard:

-a candle is waste (materials, labor)

-incense is waste (materials, labor)

-a votive object is waste (materials, labor, money)

-a statue is waste (it required resources to make and acquire)

-writing a hymn is waste (paper/ink, time and energy)

-making art is waste (materials, time, electricity if digital)

-even setting aside time to pray is ""waste"" (time could be used for something else)

-and the entire concept of ""devotional time"" becomes morally suspicious because time is also a resource.

By this logic, the entire category of ritual practice becomes immoral ""waste.""

So if the principle becomes ""avoid waste at all costs,"" then the only consistent outcome is: don't practice at all, or only do things you would already do for purely secular reasons (which is just a way of saying the religion is being hollowed out until it's no longer really religion, just personal habit with a divine label attached).

And that ties into another pattern that it seems no one wants to talk about:

A lot of people only ""offer"" things they were already going to consume, do, or enjoy anyway.
This is part of why the ""eating offerings is totally fine"" argument gets pushed so hard.

-They drink coffee every morning anyway, so they ""offer coffee"" and then drink it themselves.

-They snack while working, so they ""offer snacks"" and then eat them.

-They already burn incense because they like the smell, so that becomes a ""devotional act"" or ""burnt offering""

-They already light candles because it's cozy, so that becomes ""worship.""

-They do art anyway, so a drawing they'd already be making becomes their ""offering.""

-They already have a statue or decor item they like, so it becomes a ""votive.""

-They regularly shower, so that becomes a ""devotional activity""

-They already go to the gym, now repurposed as ""devotional activity""

-They already wanted to eat dessert, so they ""set some aside for the gods""... and then eat it.

None of this is inherently wrong. People can build a devotional life however they want, but it's important to be honest about what's happening. That's not Hellenic practice.

These offerings are not actually gifts.They're personal pleasures or routine acts that get temporarily routed through the language of religion.
That's why reclaiming the offering afterward feels normal to them,because they never actually let go of anything.
And that's why genuine sacrifice, even a tiny amount, feels ""wasteful"" from their perspective.Not because the offering would meaningfully deprive them or anyone else,but because it represents a real relinquishing of something.

It requires the one thing modern hyper-personal spirituality hates: not getting the thing back.
And that's the whole issue.

If your ""offerings"" are always items you would already eat, drink, burn, use, or do, with or without gods in the picture, then what you're doing isn't giving.... just looping ordinary life through a religious label.

Again, people can practice however they want.But this has nothing to do with Hellenic logic, reciprocity, or kharis.

In Hellenic polytheism, an offering means you actually give something.You release it.You relinquish it.You don't immediately reclaim it because you never owned it anymore.

In Hellenic religion, offerings aren't symbolic metaphors for feelings, they're concrete gestures in a real exchange relationship. The gods receive honor through what is actually given, not merely intended.
If people can't do that, they should use votives or non-consumable offering. Perfectly valid, no shame needed.

These routines of offering what you were already going to eat, drink, burn, or do, can absolutely be part of someone's spiritual life. But they don't operate on the same logic as traditional Hellenic offerings, which are built on relinquishing something as a gesture of building reciprocity. So they're valid forms of personal devotion, but they're not the same category as offerings in a Hellenic religious sense.

This is also why I think the ""waste"" argument is usually not actually about ethics in the broad sense, it's about an emotional threshold around giving something up. And I'm not saying that as an insult, there are totally valid reasons someone might feel that way. If you're food insecure, if scarcity is a lived trauma, if you grew up with instability, the act of letting something go can trigger panic or guilt. That's real. But it's still important to name what's happening. The objection isn't a historically grounded Hellenic principle, it's a personal boundary (and a completely understandable one) being treated like a universal rule.

Nothing being said here denies that some people have trauma around scarcity. If someone is food insecure, or grew up deprived, or fears running out, then giving anything up can feel painful.

That's not the same thing as acting like household worship deprives those in need.
A bit of water on a shrine does not take clean drinking water away from the world's poor, a piece of bread does not disrupt the global food economy, and a few grapes does not worsen food insecurity.
Systems create scarcity, not household devotional acts.
If personal scarcity is the concern, that's a legitimate boundary, but it's not an argument about what Hellenism teaches.

And this is where the practical solution is actually simple, like I said: if consumables are a hard line for you, choose another type of offering that doesn't create that internal conflict. Votives, written prayers, speaking or singing hymns, a dedicated small object, a moment of structured attention, a clean and tended shrine space, those are all legitimate ways to participate in reverence while honoring your reality. What I'm pushing back on is the move from ""this is hard for me"" to ""this is the correct way Hellenism should work"" or ""the traditional logic of sacrifice is wrong/unethical in modern life.""

The argument that ""ancient practices don't apply today"" is only meaningful when ancient practices depended on social conditions we no longer have.
This isn't one of them.
For many modern practitioners, though absolutely not all, modern conditions actually make offerings easier. Many modern worshippers are not dependent on a small piece of bread for survival. Giving up a bit of milk is less of a burden today than it was 2,500 years ago. That wasn't necessarily true in antiquity. In other words, the ancient world often asked more of people, not less. If someone today is in a situation where every calorie matters, then food offerings simply aren't the right option for them, and that's completely valid. But ""modern context"" doesn't inherently make offerings obsolete.

Invoking ""modern context"" to lessen the meaning of sacrifice contradicts the whole logic.If anything, modern abundance increases our capacity to give, not reduces it.

(Yes, I know this doesn't apply to everybody in the world. I am food insecure myself. But a small food offering has never made me go without a meal or be more hungry than I already would have been. If that's not true for somebody else, that's obviously fine)

Because the deeper issue, and the reason this conversation keeps spiraling, is that a lot of this disagreement isn't actually about ""what's ethical"" or ""what's historically accurate"" so much as it is about what kind of religion people are trying to build in the first place.

A lot of the tension comes from two different religious models colliding. Eclectic paganism is shaped by a modern framework that centers personal meaning, psychological symbolism, flexible boundaries, rule aversion, and individual preference. Hellenic religion is structured around reciprocity, ritual obligation, and practices that have meaning independent of personal comfort. Neither model is inherently wrong, but they are not the same, and problems arise when one is presented as interchangeable with the other.
In plenty of these threads, what's being defended is a very eclectic, highly individualized spirituality where anything can be reframed as ""personal practice"" and any boundary or historical constraint is treated like policing.

So then, when someone says ""but Hellenism has a specific religious logic: reciprocity, ritual exchange, honor, and the meaning of giving,"" the response is often not real engagement but an emotional knee-jerk reaction, such as accusations of gatekeeping, claims that reconstructionists ""haven't examined their beliefs,"" and a refusal to tolerate the idea that some practices have a meaning that isn't fully replaceable by personal preference.

What makes that especially ironic is that the ""reconstructionism"", at its best, is not blind rule-following. It's the attempt to take the ancient evidence seriously enough to ask, what did this practice mean in its own framework, and what gets lost when we resize it to fit a modern comfort zone?

What's actually unexamined is assuming that religion should always conform perfectly to your comfort level, your modern preferences, and your psychological ease, and then accusing others of elitism when they point out that Hellenism is, in fact, a religion with a structure. And honestly, there isn't even a crazy amount of structure or rules. But the few that are important, ALL, ALWAYS get pushed back on.

When people insist that any appeal to ancient context is automatically authoritarian or elitist, they're basically importing a modern secular stance (where religion is assumed to be private, optional, and largely psychological) and then treating that stance as if it were somehow the only reasonable reading of antiquity.

And that brings us back to the original offering question, because it's a perfect example of the broader split. Hellenic religion, as it's attested, treats the divine-human relationship as real and operational, built through reciprocity, honoring, and the deliberate act of giving. The divine isn't imagined as distant and uninterested (outside of specific philosophical frameworks), the world isn't framed as ""mundane"" most of the time and ""divine"" only in rare, authorized moments. The whole structure of household rites, festivals, vows, libations, sacrificial logic, only makes sense if the gods are understood to be actively involved in human life and if human actions toward them have meaning within that relationship.

So when someone says, ""It's fine to eat the offering, it's just a modern adaptation,"" I'm not saying they're a bad person or that they're forbidden to do what they need to do to feel safe, or just practice their own preferences. I'm saying, if your goal is Hellenism as a religion with its own internal logic, then eating the offering isn't a neutral ""adaptation"", it removes the core meaning of the act (giving something up in honor) and replaces it with something else (self consumption framed as devotion). And once we normalize that, the ""waste"" argument becomes a tool for dissolving the very concept of offering, because the same logic would undo nearly every material, temporal, and intentional investment that makes worship worship at all.

The simplest bottom line is, if the issue is scarcity or anxiety, choose non-consumable offerings and be honest about why. But if the issue is ""waste,"" then the consistent application of that principle would undercut the entire practice of religion, because devotion, by definition, costs something. And historically, that cost is not a bug, it's the point.

If someone is interested in following Hellenic practices, and can't spare food offerings for personal, financial, or trauma reasons, then they shouldn't give food offerings at all.They should give something else.There are dozens of valid options.
But redefining ""offering"" to mean ""I get to eat this afterward"" just erases the meaning of the act and replaces it with self comfort in disguise.
An offering only has meaning because it's something you give.Once you take it back, it's not an offering. It's just food you moved around.

One more thing. To avoid misunderstanding, it's also worth noting that in ancient public cult, animal sacrifice often included a communal meal. A portion of the animal was burned for the gods, while the remaining edible parts were cooked and shared by the worshippers. This does not contradict anything said above, because this was a ritualized division built into the sacrificial system itself, not a case of presenting something to a deity and then reclaiming it. Household offerings (libations, first fruits, shrine food, votives) followed a different logic, where what was given was not taken back. The modern practice of ""offering snacks and then eating them"" does not correspond to either ancient model.

It's important to recognize that there are distinctions between reconstructionist, revivalist, and eclectic approaches to Hellenic polytheism. I'm not claiming one is inherently better than the other, each has its place and purpose for each individual. But, they operate under different assumptions. Much of the online conflict arises from blurring these lines. Treating eclectic practices as if they follow historically grounded reconstructionist logic, or conflating modern convenience with ancient religious principles. A lot of this debate is also fueled by implicit judgment, with people assigning value, correctness, or moral weight to practices that differ from their own. What counts as a reasonable adaptation, what truly needs modification for the modern world, and what crosses the line away from historical Hellenism are highly subjective, and interpretations vary widely. Many disagreements aren't simply about facts or history, they're about personal thresholds, assumptions, and frameworks for how religion should be practiced. Recognizing these distinctions can help clarify why debates get heated, why disagreements often reflect differing goals rather than ""right"" or ""wrong,"" and how multiple approaches can coexist without invalidating one another. When we talk about what is and is not a reasonable, accurate adaptation of ancient practice, this is my take on eating offerings, within a historical Hellenic framework. It is worth emphasizing that even reconstructionists are often making educated interpretations, not speaking on a “one true framework.” There is no monolithic standard to begin with. 


…anyway, that’s my two drachmas on the subject 😅

How do I move forward?","I'll share a little back story for a little understanding of my past, along with what I know of hers. For me, I have always been a man who couldn't find a relationship, eventually accepting that it may never happen to me. In high school and shortly after, I have had a few relationships that resulted in me catching them cheating, so starting in my early twenties, I decided it was best to let life come to me. I joined the military, got out of my hometown and didn't really pursue anyone. While I was in, however, a longtime friend of mine had moved near the base I was stationed at. We decided to start hanging out, mainly as friends, but it eventually turned romantic. Once I got out of the service, we took the next step in our relationship and I thought everything was running a great course. We were happy, we went on adventures together, bedroom life was incredible and we basically spent every minute outside of work together. After about a year and a half together, I began noticing her putting distance between us. She got short with me and would even sit on the opposite side of the couch when I was there. Then one day, out of the blue, she just dropped it on me that she couldn't love the way I should be loved and that I didn't do anything wrong, but that she felt she wasn't ready for the life commitment. And that was that, following that conversation, I was blocked on everything. Now, before the comments say she had someone else, I have confirmed that was never the case, she just wanted to be alone.

  
Now for my current girlfriend, we'll call her El (stranger things on my mind) for the sake of the story, her past I know the basics of. she's been with abusive boyfriends, as confirmed by her parents, and her ex-husband left her to do everything on her own, including raise their child, even when they were married. She's even had some family situations that has left her to do everything with no one else to rely on. So for her, I can see where she sees herself as extremely independent, but ill share that info in the actual story.

  
Me and El met earlier this year at her job. When I first met her, I was awestruck, using humor to hide the fact that was losing control of basic motor functions around her. Now me, I can't actually approach women, never have been able to, so I didn't make any type of move on her. A few weeks later, she pops up on my recommended friends list on Facebook. I hesitated for about a day to even send her a friend request because I thought that would be weird of me. However, my thumb took full control, looked her up again and sent the request. To my surprise, she accepted and we began talking. After several weeks of messaging back and forth, we finally decided to meet at a coffee shop in town and it was by far the best first date I have ever been on. The nerves quickly subsided and the conversation flowed effortlessly. It had been hours by the time we decided we needed to leave to get things done that we needed to do in our personal lives, I walked her to her car and ended up kissing her right there, which was met with happy acceptance.

  
As we continued to talk and get closer, I couldn't help but remember how my previous relationship had went. All the happiness and great adventures met with a quick, heartless ending. Naturally, I waited a while to make things official with her, but the comments kept coming; when I would say 'my girl' it was met with a 'not yet' or something was coming along those lines. I finally looked myself in the mirror one night and told myself to not miss out on someone so great due to my past, she's worth it. The next day, I asked her to be my girlfriend and she lit up.

  
Shortly after this happened, she called me while I was at work, which was unusual because she worked the same hours really. She broke the news to me that she was late and wanted to know if I wanted to come over to be with her when she took a test. Positive. she was in fact pregnant. As happy as I was, she was as nervous due to complications during pregnancies for her, but I held her and assured her that no matter what, I am here. She wasn't lying on how rough it was on her. We constantly tried to find ways to cure her constant sickness, and even made trips to the doctors and hospital for the severity. We made our way to the second ultrasound, and found that the baby was in great health. The pictures of our little one was amazing, already starting to take shape. We were about a week before the second trimester when I received a call from her at 2 am to the news that she had lost the baby.

  
We were devastated. And thats an understatement. But one thing I knew was that I couldn't control that situation, but she needed help. Its rough on her, even rougher on her body I'm sure of, but I was determined to do whatever I could to be there for her and assure her that once again, I'm not going anywhere. Following the loss of the baby, she pulled away, which I completely understood. And that lasted for a while, but I wasn't going to push her. I was thrilled when she still asked me to travel to the other side of the country with her to meet the other side of her family, even though we were still in a rough patch, but ultimately, the trip did us some good. Once we were back, we had a good talk and have started to move forward.

  
Things were great, we were thriving and everyone around us looked at us as a power couple. To me, I thought that getting through that time was crucial for us and proved to both of us that we were strong together. 

  
About a month ago I started seeing signs of her getting distant again. I would hear from her less and less throughout the day and would virtually never hear from her before she went to bed. I had seen that work for her has gotten out of hand and she had expressed some of her stresses that she had. I noticed the life getting drained from her by the time she was getting off of work, so I didn't want to add anything to her plate by being concerned about goodnight texts. But that changed a couple of weeks ago when as I was leaving her place, I told her as always if she needs me to call me, but this time she replied with I won't. I sat on that all night. I decided to bring it up and asked her if we were okay, and she started on about how she doesn't know how to accept the love that I show her, no matter how hard she tries. How she's used to doing everything on her own and doesn't expect anyone to step in and be there.

  
That conversation ended with her saying she needed time to think. During those few days, I started losing my mind, crying harder than I ever have in my life at the thought that I may lose her. A couple of days later, I was out at lunch with some of her family, something I did often since I was close with them, and the conversation shifted to the topic of me and El. According to them, when times get hard, she has the tendency to self sabotage and retreat to what she knows best, being alone. This conversation sparked mine and El's first actual argument with how it wasn't fair that I talked with her family about the situation. But to me, I just wanted advice from people who know her better than I do. The following day, we had a calm conversation where she told me that she's going to get help, but she needs to do it alone. She told me she doesn't want to break up, but simply take time to go through a few therapy sessions and then we will talk and reassess if its something she can work through her problems with me by her side or not, so from there, we have basically gone no contact other than a random 'hope you're doing okay' text.

  
Last week was Thanksgiving obviously, and originally she was going to come with me to meet my dads side of the family since I'm from a different state, but she didn't come with everything that just transpired. The trip home was rough for me, questions as to why she didn't come, questions as to what was going on with us. I ended up packing up and coming home early. And with Christmas coming up, I don't have it in me to celebrate without her.

  
She is the love that I never saw coming and I can tell you this, I have never felt this way about anyone before. This is the first time I have envisioned a future with someone and have been open with even my friends that she's what I want in life. Before the comments come in, no, there isn't another guy involved and yes, I do believe her reasoning. To me, it's about making that choice to battle your demons if you truly love someone, but some people do need help. My past tells me that this is prolonging the inevitable of her leaving me. My heart is telling me to continue the fight because she could have left already, but hasn't. It kills me not being able to talk to her. I am always checking my phone to see if she's messaged or called. Slowly, I am losing the battle within and have had more and more nights of breaking down in fear.

  
I guess my question really isn't a question, but I could use advice on how to continue this fight. ",1,1764989281.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

One of Reese's channel members sends a superchat mentioning the gift basket she sent him in jail. When he fixes his mic, he talks about how nice it was to have a steaming hot shower in his own home. Aaron says a huge thank you ""to everyone who kept the channel going and the community updated."" He says his wife, Heather, helped a lot behind the scenes.   
  
Aaron says going to jail was the best and the worst thing that has ever happened to him. He says a lot of good, normal people are in jail for bogus reasons. He says the jail system is just a way to generate money for the state of Florida and adds that probation is a scam to try to keep people ensnared in the system. Aaron says there are a lot of homeless people in the jail where he was and he claims that if a homeless person is caught sleeping at a construction site, they are charged with burglary even if they didn't take anything.   
  
He says he was in a bad frame of mind on the Friday when the judge decided to keep him in jail when Aaron was sure he would be getting out that day but that he soon settled into a routine to pass the time in jail. He says he made friends there. He calls himself a kind, friendly person who shared things with other inmates.   
  
Aaron brings up a Scientologist who ran a Ponzi scheme and defrauded people out of hundreds of millions of dollars. He says David Gentile was sentenced to seven years in federal prison and he reported to prison around the time that Aaron was put in jail. Just a few days ago, President Trump commuted Gentile's sentence. Aaron wrongfully claims that Gentile was fully pardoned. Aaron asks people to find out and tell him what Gentile's connection to Trump is and if it goes any deeper than Scientology megadonor Trish Duggan.

Aaron says the judge made it clear today that her main concern has not been protesting Scientology but instead Aaron's supposed violations of the original order of protection involving the Sea Org member he threw a lot of Holi powder on. Aaron claims that all of the examples the judge cited today of Aaron violating the protection order happened before that order was put in place.   
  
He says it's a victory that he was let out of jail without an ankle monitor. Aaron says he was scared shitless today because the judge ""made my lawyers beg and plead and argue"" for why Aaron should be let out of jail. He adds that one of his lawyers told the judge that even if she doesn't like Aaron's video titles or the fact that he's bombastic, Aaron understands the rules and is prepared to abide by them.   
  
Aaron mocks the state's attorney and says she tried to get the judge to increase the restraining order from 500 feet to 1,000 feet away from any Scientology building where the Sea Org members Aaron is charged with battering might be working.   
  
Aaron says the judge told the state's attorney she was sure that Scientology will be measuring to the foot how close Aaron comes to its building and she told him Scientology ""isn't some rinky-dink outfit"" he's going up against. He's laughing while he's talking about this. Aaron says the judge told him he needs to be careful and know what he's doing because Scientology has a lot of resources and the cult has cameras everywhere.   
  
Aaron says he learned in his previous court appearance that the deputies didn't want him turning around to look at the gallery. He claims he thought they might taze him so he refrained from looking at the gallery today even though he heard people laughing in the courtroom.   
  
Aaron says he doesn't have a restraining order involving the second Sea Org security guard but that the judge apparently wants him to act as though he does. Aaron says that's fine with him.

Aaron says from now on, in every video he does before these cases are resolved, he will be reading a disclaimer that says nothing in this video is intended to communicate with the Sea Org members he's charged with battering and nothing is intended to entice others to communicate with or harass those Sea Org members.   
  
Aaron says he is allowed to encourage other people to protest at Scientology's main buildings in downtown Clearwater and he will continue to do so. He says the state's attorney will interpret that as Aaron encouraging others to harass the Sea Org members he's charged with battering. ""The judge isn't falling for that,"" he says.   
  
Aaron is getting a bunch of superchats during this stream but it's nothing like the floods of superchats he used to get when he was doing some of his coverage of Danny Masterson's trials or streaming with Marc and Mike Rinder.  
  
Aaron argues that there's no way he or any other protesters can know when those Sea Org members are at the Scientology buildings where protesters gather. Aaron says he thinks the prosecutors in his case are ridiculous and that they're engaging in malicious prosecution for political purposes.   
  
Aaron claims one of the prosecutors took offense to things he said about her during private phone calls from jail. Aaron says the prosecutor was telling the judge that Aaron was slandering her and he mocks that while repeating his claim that she doesn't know what she's doing and she's being played like a fiddle by Scientology. ""The judge said I had every right to say that,"" Aaron says, laughing.   
  
Aaron says he did over three hours of phone calls every day in jail and he thanks everyone who put money in his commissary account. He claims he spent about $400 on food and $600 on phone calls.   
  
Aaron says the judge made a lot of comments today about him sticking his camera in people's faces. He claims she doesn't understand that he's not actually doing that and she doesn't understand social media. Aaron says both of his lawyers have told him that when it comes to trials, he couldn't hope for a better judge than the one who's already on his case. Aaron says the pre-trial phase has lots of opportunities for Scientology to be manipulative.   
  
Aaron says he had a two and a half hour psychological evaluation and the woman he spoke with told Aaron that he was the most interesting person she'd spoken to in a long time and that Aaron has serious PTSD. Aaron says he's not going back to jail, losing at trial or picking up any new charges. ""Scientology's fucked,"" he says.

Aaron says Scientology just took its best shots at him and at what he calls SPTV Nation ""and it didn't work. It didn't take me out. It made me that much more resolved."" He claims he will be more disciplined moving forward.   
  
Aaron says he joked to his daughters that he was in rehab for social media addiction. He adds that he also joked with them that jail is like summer camp but with less molestation. Aaron spends 13 hours a day on his phone, he says, and most of that time is spent doom-scrolling on Twitter and Instagram. Aaron says he enjoyed being alone with his own thoughts in jail.   
  
He complains that the jail had no pillows and that inmates were only supposed to have one towel but the jail makes it easy for people to steal more towels and use them as makeshift pillows until deputies come around every so often and do searches for contraband and stolen towels.   
  
Aaron says the woman who did his psych eval gave him some really good feedback on his work with his YouTube channel and the SPTV Foundation. He says she told him that his work would be even more effective if he got therapy. Aaron says she told him there are resources where he could get therapy for about $75 a session and he told her that's $75 too much. He claims if therapy were free, he'd do it all the time. She told Aaron that the type of work he does is constantly reinjuring his PTSD. ""It honestly feels like a price worth paying,"" he says.   
  
Aaron says his lawyer argued to the judge today that Aaron is part of a movement to help Scientologists and that hundreds of thousands of dollars have been raised for the SPTV Foundation and dozens of people have been helped by that foundation.   
  
After getting out of jail today, Aaron says he went straight home and spent some time with his daughters and some of their friends. Aaron's oldest daughter was in court today, he says.

Aaron says he wonders if he could grow the Clearwater protest movement more if he started streaming from his SPTV studio during the protests and offering to help and promote new channels for protesters.   
  
He says one of the most-watched shows in jail is King of Queens so a lot of inmates wanted to talk to him about Leah Remini and Scientology and the Aftermath. Aaron says he was giving away about 30 cups of coffee a day and it was like he was running a free Starbucks.   
  
Aaron says his daughter whose boyfriend just died is doing very well and that Heather arranged for her to have some grief counseling.   
  
Aaron says he wouldn't want protesters going out and saying that they were looking for the Sea Org member he threw Holi powder at.   
  
He says he was excited to learn about the story of Jesus and other Bible stories because he's very interested in how religions impact the world, but he tells his audience not to worry and that he's not converting to Christianity.   
  
Aaron says his second lawyer told him that he could help Aaron file criminal reports for battery against the two Sea Org members Aaron is charged with battering.   
  
He starts talking about the Lisa McPherson memorial event that's happening in Clearwater tonight and says he has heard that a lot of people were planning to go to Prelude Sports Bar but Aaron can't go there because of his no-contact order. ""We can meet up somewhere else,"" Aaron says.   
  
Aaron says he feels like SPTV is getting back to the good old days. ""I think we needed this reset,"" he says.",5,1764988919.0,OT42,1,0.86,False

1pfe5z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/weyler/comments/1pfe5z8/how_wednesday_and_tyler_flip_traditional_gender/,How Wednesday and Tyler flip traditional gender roles,"Emotions:

​​Wednesday in season 2 wouldn't let herself admit to any emotions besides anger, the classic stoic tough guy act. ​​Tyler spent season 1 repressing anger and acting cheerful and nice when in human form, the ""barista boy"" who existed to serve others.

​Skill sets:

​When we first meet them, Tyler is serving coffee, while Wednesday is kicking three boys' asses without breaking a sweat. Tyler continues to exhibit various similar Martha Stewart skills, like making sure her birthday cake has the right ingredients and the Crypt is perfectly decorated for their date. Wednesday meanwhile spends most of her time going around being a private eye detective. Obviously all this is complicated by the fact that Tyler's skills at violence do end up exceeding Wednesday's, due to his supernatural monster form. But it's still noteworthy that given his penchant for food prep and domestic crafts and little unspectacular acts of service in general - not just ""I saved your life"" but ""I made sure this cake wouldn't trigger your allergies"" - Wednesday is \*never\* going to end up the housewife with him.

Sexualization:

​They made this pretty obvious in Willow Hill, right? Tyler is put into restraints that looks suspiciously like bondage gear, divested of his shirt so we can see his bare in-shape upper body, and damn if they didn't put glycerine or something on it to make him look shiny? Meanwhile, Wednesday is wearing the same clothes she always wears plus a coat. Nothing whatsoever of her body is put on display. Even the nice black dress she wears for the school dance is neither form-fitting nor skin-revealing.

Morality:

In most popular media, while males get to be broody morally grey redeemable bad guys and forgivable antiheroes, females are expected to be either good or bad, one or the other. The most blatant form of this, the madonna whore love triangle, shows up in everything from male-gaze thrillers like Fatal Attraction to female-gaze romances like Fifty Shades of Gray to Gothic melodramas like Crimson Peak. But Wednesday defies this just by being herself. Per the usual Addams Family rule of disturbing = funny,  she gets to be the character we all root for while also doing bad things. And she doesn't even have to look sexy while doing them! (see above)

It finally worked out that I went by the coffee shop today that she likes to work from. When I pulled in I saw her car and my heart almost jumped out of my chest. When I walked inside there she was as beautiful as the last time I’d seen her. She sat against the wall as I ordered I tried to not make it so obvious that I was staring at her. But after getting my coffee I walked over and saw her smile again. I’ve missed seeing her smile. We sat and talked for a few hours while she worked. I mostly pretended to work. But for the first hour my hands shook as bad as the first time I met her. Being in her presence is so intimating yet calming at the same time. My entire adult life my job has put me in harms way but I have never been as nervous as I am when I’m with her. She’s the most beautiful woman I could have ever imagined. Not just her physical appearance but her soul is breath taking. Both of our current circumstances make it so we can’t really talk or see each other often but being with her today only for a few hours has brought me so much happiness. I long for the next time we can run into each other again or the day when everything aligns and we can take that next step. Until then I will miss her and always be thinking about her.

I bought a couple pieces from Spanx’s AirEssentials line originally just for lounging and WFH… and now I reach for it constantly.

It’s soft enough that I’m actually comfortable sitting at my desk all day, but still looks put-together enough for quick errands, coffee runs, or answering the door without feeling sloppy. I’ve also worn it through airports and long travel days and it didn’t wrinkle or feel gross by the end of the day.

I think what surprised me most is how easy it is to layer — hoodie, jacket, coat, whatever, it all works. It kind of replaced my old leggings + oversized sweatshirt uniform without me even trying.

Not trying to hype a brand, just genuinely curious: has anyone else found a “default outfit” they didn’t expect to basically live in?",1,1764988418.0,spanx,0,1.0,False

This'll be weird, considering that TF2 isn't really the type of game you'd expect to harm someone. Sure, mentally, but never physically. I just wanna tell you guys this in case, and please reach out if you know something.

Ever since junior high, I've been friends with my buddy, Kyle. He's always so busy with steam and especially in TF2. I still remember when he recommended playing the game. Of course, I liked it, but I never found any time to play. This is connected to my current issue, somehow..

I got home from school, yes, we're like grade 12 now. I was gonna do some quick assignments using ChatGPT. Normally, I'd use my phone, but it was low on batt because I used it at school. I was gonna text him ""any shit happened for you today?"", but I saw that he was on TF2. So, typical friend etiquette, I trolled him. I sent him a text saying ""spy behind u"". And I knew he saw it because a few seconds after I sent him the text, he shot another back saying ""I just died to a soldier."" He followed with ""you btch."". I chuckled a little, wanting to ragebait him more, but I crammed lots of assignments and most of them were due tomorrow, so I closed steam and tabbed back to my homework.

At least half an hour had gone by already, and I only had like 2 essays and a slideshow assignment left to complete, so I sent him a text saying I'll hop on soon. ""all talk, but no do"" he replied. I scoffed, and as I was about to tab back into my assigns, he sent a text ""just dont leave me be, fucko"". I ignored it, and went back to doing my school shit.

Finally,  I finished it all. It was midnight already. Usually, I'd flop onto my bed, but I still had a promise for that guy. So, I opened steam and texted him. ""hopping on, better not be dustbowl"", he replied with ""watever"". I still joined, not caring about any of his tomfoolery shit. It was nucleus, fortunately. He was playing pyro, even though he's a sniper main. I was a spy and medic main, but since there's already like, 3 spies, I went medic.

I can't say I didn't have a fun time, no. This game was a gem in Valve history, so of course it would be hilarious, irritatting, and fun. I also managed to no scope some poor scout as sniper, which I also got surprised about. After a couple of games, I decided to go to sleep. I was just gonna overdose on coffee tomorrow to not sleep in class, so would he, so we planned to meet at a starbucks near our campus. I went to bed, closed my eyes, and fell into slumberworld.

The next day, Kyle never came. Disappointed, I sent him a text on WhatsApp. ""yo, dickbend, where r u?"" no response, ""youll get expelled cuz of how much you skip school, yknow"" no response. I got so irritated that I called a taxi just to go to his house and to hit him with a  notebook. As the taxi drove to his address, I couldn't help but notice that he hadn't been online. Normal Kyle wouldve atleast left me on read or something, but no, still no signs of him. When I arrived at his address, I knocked on the door. His parents opened the door, and they let me in, since they already knew me because Kyle usually went to my house, and I usually went to his, anyways. They said that he had gone into a coma, it was terrible they said. Blood came out of his mouth and his eyes clouded over.. I felt a little nauseous imagining it. But a detail caught my attention.. they said that he was still on his chair, still on his desk, and still playing some game. Of course, I knew that game was TF2, but how? I went to the hospital to see him, but he was just limp, and his body was pale, like he had died, but he still had a pulse. I skipped school that day. I went on steam, and I saw him online. How? Is my mind messing with me or some shit? I saw Kyle on a hospital bed, in a coma. How would he be online right now?? I knew it couldn't have been anyone else because Kyle's brother works abroad, and Kyle and his brother were the only people who knew how to operate a computer in his family. I opened my DMs, and saw that he had sent me some messages. ""just dont leave me be, fucko"". It was that same text, over and over again. I didn't wanna go on TF2 ever again, I couldn't.

If anyone knows about this, please reach out, do anything to help. Just give me an explanation, please. I just wanna play with Kyle again.",1,1764988344.0,ServerBlight,0,1.0,False

1pfdxh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkLikeAnAdult/comments/1pfdxh8/how_to_sleep_better_boost_energy_by_fixing_this/,How to Sleep Better & Boost Energy By Fixing This ONE Morning Habit (NO BS Guide),"Ever noticed how you're exhausted by 2 PM, but still can't fall asleep at night? It’s not just you. Most people around me, smart, driven, ambitious types, complain about either feeling wired all day or chronically sleepy. And yet, they scroll TikTok for morning hacks like lemon water and cold showers from influencers who barely cite any science. That’s where it gets messy. Because one of the most powerful tools to fix your energy and sleep? It’s free. Backed by dozens of peer-reviewed studies. And you can do it in 10 minutes before coffee.

Let’s break it down step by step. This isn't another productivity bro thread. This is science-backed, real-life better-living advice, sourced from Dr. Andrew Huberman (neuroscientist at Stanford), and experts from The Sleep Foundation, Harvard Health, and Chronobiology International.

### Step 1: Get sunlight in your eyes within 30-60 minutes after waking

Yes. Morning sunlight. That’s it. But let me explain why this is a game changer.

According to Dr. Andrew Huberman, your circadian rhythm, your 24-hour internal clock that controls energy, focus, mood, and sleep, is highly sensitive to light in the morning. When you get natural light in your eyes early, it triggers a cortisol pulse, which promotes alertness and focus. It also sets off a timer for your body to release melatonin 14 - 16 hours later... exactly when you want to fall asleep.

No sunlight = delayed melatonin = trouble sleeping = tired all day.

And no, ceiling lights or phone screens don’t work. Sunlight’s intensity is 50 - 100x brighter than indoor light. Even on cloudy days, outdoor light beats your phone flashlight by miles.

Here’s how to do it:

- 10 minutes of sunlight if sunny, 15 - 20 minutes if cloudy  
- No sunglasses (but avoid directly staring at the sun)  
- Do this within an hour of waking up  
- Bonus: go on a short walk to get morning movement in too  

The Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine published a study in 2017 showing that office workers with windows got 173% more natural light exposure and reported significantly better sleep and vitality than those in windowless offices. This ONE tweak changes everything.

### Step 2: Avoid artificial light before bed, or get blue-light glasses

Just like your brain loves light in the morning, it hates it at night. If you’re stuck on your laptop or phone past 9 PM, that blue light is suppressing melatonin, the hormone that makes you sleepy.

A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that people reading on iPads before bed took 10 minutes longer to fall asleep, had less REM sleep, and felt groggier the next day. The light literally shifts your internal clock by HOURS.

What to do:

- Use Flux or Night Shift to dim screens after sunset  
- Buy blue-light blocking glasses (like Felix Gray or Swanwick)  
- Add warm lighting in your room (Himalayan salt lamp works)  
- Read a physical book instead of scrolling  

### Step 3: Use the best app for circadian habit stacking

Try Finch. It’s a wellness pet app but don’t let the cuteness fool you. Finch uses psychological habit loops to help you build morning and evening rituals, including things like sunlight walks, gratitude journaling, and screen-free wind-downs.

Each habit earns you points to grow your pet. But here’s the real power: gamifying self-care builds dopamine reward loops, making these habits stick long term.

It works shockingly well, especially for neurodivergent brains or anyone tired of boring checklist apps.

### Step 4: Add this personalized audio learning app to your walk

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns expert books, research papers, and talks into personalized, podcast-style lessons you can listen to during your morning sunlight walk. Built by a team of Columbia University alums and Google AI experts, it pulls insights from top sources and tailors content to your goals and mood.

I’ll often ask it to teach me about something I’m working on, like improving focus or understanding dopamine cycles, and it creates a 15- or 30-minute podcast, using a voice I choose (mine’s a calm female one before bed, and energetic in the morning). You can even pause and ask it questions mid-episode.

I’ve replaced my social media scroll with this and feel way more mentally clear. Highly recommend for any lifelong learner.

### Step 5: Stop caffeine AFTER 2 pm (seriously)

Caffeine has a half-life of about 6 hours. That means if you drink a latte at 3 PM, half the caffeine is still in your body at 9 PM. Even if you fall asleep, your sleep quality tanks.

Sleep scientist Matthew Walker (author of Why We Sleep) says caffeine blocks adenosine, a molecule that builds up sleep pressure throughout the day. No adenosine = no urge to sleep = lighter, fragmented sleep.

So:

- Keep caffeine to the AM  
- Switch to herbal teas (chamomile, rooibos) after 2 PM  
- If you MUST sip something warm, try mushroom coffee or decaf  

### Step 6: Try NSDR (non-sleep deep rest) mid-day

If you can’t nap or feel drained in the afternoon, try NSDR protocols. Huberman raves about this.

NSDR is a form of guided resting state that mimics some of the benefits of sleep, improves dopamine sensitivity, reduces fatigue, boosts learning. Unlike meditation, it’s more passive.

Apps and YouTube channels for NSDR:

- YouTube: “NSDR Protocol” by Huberman Lab (10 - 30 min sessions)  
- Insight Timer App: Search for “Yoga Nidra” or “NSDR”  
- Reveri App: Created by hypnosis expert Dr. David Spiegel from Stanford  

### Step 7: Best book you’ll ever read on sleep

Why We Sleep by Dr. Matthew Walker (bestseller, translated into 40+ languages). Dr. Walker is a world-leading sleep scientist and this book will blow your mind.

It explains how sleep affects memory, creativity, immune function, even attractiveness. The chapters on REM and dreaming hit me hard. You’ll never think of pulling an all-nighter the same way again.

This book will make you question everything you think you know about sleep. No fluff. Just jaw-dropping research and real tools. This is the best science book on health I’ve ever read. Read it even if you think you sleep fine.

### Step 8: Podcasts and YouTube that will transform your energy game

- Huberman Lab Podcast: Start with the episode “Master Your Sleep & Be More Alert During the Day”  
- FoundMyFitness (by Dr. Rhonda Patrick): Deep dives on circadian biology  
- Andrew D. Huberman YouTube Channel: Visual explanations on sunlight, NSDR, serotonin, etc.  

### Step 9: Sleep tracker… but with caution

Want to really know how your sleep is going? Use a tracker, but don’t obsess. Oura ring and Whoop are solid options. But if that’s too pricey, Sleep Cycle (free app) uses your phone’s mic to analyze your sleep patterns.

It helps you observe trends like:

- What time you fall asleep best  
- How caffeine, alcohol or workouts affect your rest  
- Natural wake-up windows  

### Step 10: Stack it all into a 20-minute morning ritual

If you want to feel better today AND fix your sleep long term, try this:

- Wake up and step outside immediately  
- No phone, no emails, just sunlight + movement for 10 - 20 min  
- Listen to a short podcast while walking (like Huberman’s NSDR guide or a BeFreed episode)  
- Back home, caffeine + journaling + planning your day  

That one ritual? Might fix your whole life.",2,1764988052.0,TalkLikeAnAdult,0,1.0,False
1pfdw6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1pfdw6x/can_you_please_give_me_the_link_to_this_story/,Can you please give me the link to this story?,"""Is Audrey the real reason you came to find me, Grayson? Is that really why you came?"" she asked again, her warm, longing gaze locked with mine as I held in the rage boiling inside me, threatening to explode.
Fahk no. Audrey isn't the only reason I came for her. But there's no way in h.ll I'm admitting that if she keeps clinging to these fahked-up pretences and playing along with those ridiculous lines. Did she really forget?
""Why am I even here? You left on your own, anyway. You've never changed—not now and not seven years ago. You've only ever cared about yourself. But can we drop the fahking pretence and have an honest conversation for once?"" I snapped, my anger simmering over, unable to mask the pain I'd carried through time.
Fahk it. I thought I was done feeling this way. I thought our story ended seven years ago. So why the h.ll did she have to waltz back into my life and stir shllt up again?
We were fine. Why do I have to fall for her all over again—like a dammmnn idiot?
How did we even get here? I wondered, my gaze stuck on her in raw frustration.
I could still remember those little moments we shared in that frustrated pasts, when she'll stick up for me even when things were difficult, were those emotions I caught in her eyes back then fake?
because now…her clueless, pleading expression remained, as if I'd said something cruel and incomprehensible.
How can she lie to me so easily and expect me to just take it? Am I supposed to let this slide like it's nothing?
""Grayson, if you could just explain what you mean—I really don't know what you're talking about."" Her voice trembled, anxious and afraid, though she tried to hide it behind that fine, confused expression I wanted to distort with both pain and pleasure.
This is how it's always been—running in circles, our feelings tangled and unresolved.
Why do I want to make her cry... yet also make her smile so brightly, like she's never known pain?
""Are you seriously going to keep this up? Pretending not to know me? Not to know Audrey? Lia, for fahk's sake, that's not how lies work. We lived together. We loved each other. We had a kid together—for crying out loud! What the fahk do you mean you have no idea what I'm talking about?"" I shouted, exasperated.
Why does she keep holding on to the same dammmnn lie?
Yeah, things were pretty fahked up seven years ago—we were both students. Maybe having a kid as college juniors broke us a little. But it wasn't the end of the world.
We did our best. We lived through it like adults. And maybe things were rocky, but after a year of mending wounds and taking responsibility for each other's mistakes, I really thought our feelings had become clearer.
Our relationship might've started on lies and deceit, but we got past that. The pain turned to scars, and from those scars, love bloomed. Audrey bloomed. Our mistake—my greatest treasure.
I never imagined she had it in her to abandon our baby. To abandon us the moment she gave birth—disappearing without so much as a goodbye.
Even before Audrey was born, I saw the signs: the frustration, the resentment in her eyes when she thought about what she could've achieved if Audrey wasn't in the picture.
I probably shouldn't have brushed it off as just pregnancy hormones.
I didn't care that I had nothing to my name when I was left with a tiny little bundle of life who became my bundle of joy—my reason to keep going. I healed. I was happy.
And then she showed up again.
I wish I'd tried harder to keep her away.
Why did she have to bring all those buried feelings back? Why did I let her in again?
""Grayson, I really don't know what you're talking about."" Her voice was calm now, her eyes steady, but it was the same dammmnn line.
Frustrated, I demanded, ""We're really sticking to that, huh?""
If she's already decided to lie—and I can't bring myself to force the truth out of her—then I guess this is it.
""Did we really know each other?"" she asked in a small voice, and I turned away, pretending not to notice the tears glazing her eyes. I hated how soft and broken she sounded, how her pain somehow seemed deeper than mine, as though my words were nothing but cruel accusations that stung.
I hated how easily she pulled at my emotions. Even through the rage and heartbreak, I wanted to wipe her tears and kiss those dry, peach-colored lips until we forgot everything.

""You make it sound like I'm making this shllt up. I really can't remember, Ray. Why won't you believe me? Seven years ago I—""
""You claim you've forgotten—but why did you call me that?"" I cut in sharply. Her bottle-green eyes darted nervously—not with fear, but confusion, like she was surprised by her own words.
""I—I... I don't know. I just—""
I cut off her rambling with a hollow laugh, letting it carry all the complicated, messy emotions swirling inside me.
""I guess I was that easy to forget."" My voice dropped cold. ""Seven years, and everything we shared turned to smoke for you. I guess that's how much I mattered. That's how much we mattered.""
With no control left, I buried my fist into the nearest expensive vintage table, and she flinched at the sound, fear flashing in her eyes.
I hadn't wanted to do this—not after I'd just rescued her from that bastard. But maybe I'm no better than him after all.
My gaze flicked to the bruise on her wrist, now darkened to a pale purple.
""I'm not making this up, Grayson. I really don't remember,"" she whispered, her voice still trembling, though now tinged with the same frustration I'd thrown at her. ""But I didn't forget because I wanted to, okay?""
""What the fahk does that even mean?""
My voice twisted into confusion, cutting through my rage.
And then, with reluctance, she finally confessed.
But her confession only dragged us back to where we never wanted to return—to the past.
To seven years ago.

/Thalia's POV/
""I'm sorry, Miss Kithson, there's nothing I can do. You'll have to retake the course next year since it's not even available in the summer program. Not only was your attendance terrible, but you haven't performed well in previous tests. That project was your chance to make up for it—and you screwed that up too. I'm afraid I can't help you.""
The 52-year-old professor said, lowering her glasses after reviewing my file.
""Ma'am, you've got to believe me! I did participate in the project. My name must've been omitted somehow!"" I pleaded, panic rising in my chest.
Okay… maybe I messed up. I didn't meet up with my group members, and I half-assed the research reports I submitted—but I didn't want to be anywhere near Grayson. I hate his guts. He hates mine.
The moment we were grouped together for the semester's final project—the one that counted as our entire exam grade—I knew I was screwed. I just didn't think it'd be this bad.
To avoid the daily awkwardness and middle-finger flips, I chose to work on the research and skip the group meetings.
Grayson didn't complain or protest—he just watched me walk out like he was okay with it. I should have known better. That motherfahker wasn't.
A couple of our group mates tried reaching out, but let's be honest—I'm not exactly known for being friendly. If I'd tried harder with them, maybe I'd have figured out that the perfectionist ditched my research completely, came up with a brand-new concept, and worked overtime on the project presentation without me.
I almost missed the presentation entirely. He didn't even bother to tell me about it—obviously trying to exclude me altogether.
If my best friend hadn't texted me the second my group got on stage, I would've missed the whole thing.
And just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, the presentation ended with Grayson Moore publicly highlighting everyone's contributions to the project.
He was fahking thorough.
While other groups just listed contributors vaguely—mostly whoever funded the thing—Grayson had six distinct credits to his name: project design, research, presentation, execution, editing, and management.
Me?
I had absolutely nothing. Not a single mention.
Now I'm being told I have to repeat the year because of it.
After the professor's final unapologetic, ""I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do,"" I was shoved out of her office and into the long, gloomy hallways filled with tech students drowning in deadlines and pre-exam burnout. Frustration clung to the walls like fog.
Everyone just wants to go home and recharge. The semester's been h.ll. But what's a week going to fix when the next semester starts right after?
Still, I've got my own problems.
If I find that son of a b.tch, I swear to God—I'll tear him apart.
Huffing and fuming, I stormed through the halls, scanning classrooms, labs, and lecture wings for Grayson.
Grayson, my class president and personal arch-nemesis, wasn't hard to spot.
Why?
Because he's the poster boy of the dammmnn electronics department.
And, unfortunately, the bastard looks good—something I hate to admit.
He's got this annoyingly sharp face always hidden behind glasses, standing tall at 6 feet with a solid, muscular build. His pecs stretch every flannel shirt he wears. Somehow, he even makes average denim jeans look tailor-made.
It's so irritating.
He pulls off casual wear like he's modeling it. Students at Finchley University even joke he's the hottest nerd on campus. While girls line up to worship the ground he walks on, I'd rather just ruin his entire life.
""Hey, asswipe!"" I yelled, barging through a crowd that had formed around him.
He was mid-sentence, explaining the project to a group of girls who clearly didn't care about the work—they just wanted to hear him talk in that annoyingly hot Canadian accent.
""You fahking maron!"" I snapped, shoving him hard.
But his body was so solid, it was like pushing a dammmnn wall. His chest felt like rock. Not the point—definitely not the point. I shoved those thoughts aside.
""How could you do that to me?! My entire year depended on that project. How could you remove my name!?""
He calmly bent down to pick up the glasses I'd knocked off. The girls all swooned at his perfect side profile. I rolled my eyes.
""We had 25 group meetings since the project began,"" he said, slipping his glasses back on. ""You didn't show up to a single one. You didn't contribute to the building process either, which I wanted to assign to you, not Nora. So tell me—why should I add the name of someone who did absolutely nothing?""
His apathetic voice made my blood boil.
""Do you have any idea what you did—?""
""Spare me the bullshlt, Thalia. If the project was important to you, you would've shown up.""
With that, he turned around, walking away like he hadn't just ruined my entire academic year.
I was stunned—furious—and I wasn't going to let him walk away.
Without thinking, I grabbed the drink from the nearest girl and splashed it all over him—coffee and milk soaking into his flannel.
The hallway went silent.
""Asshole,"" I spat.
But instead of shouting back, he scoffed, pulled off his soaked jacket, and revealed a tight black shirt underneath. As he wiped himself down, my eyes caught something I wasn't ready for: a small snake tattoo curling around his waist as his shirt lifted.
He leaned in close, his voice low.
""Doing this won't fix your grades. Have fun repeating the year… doofus.""
Doofus.
I turned bright red, humiliated beyond words.
The snickers and whispers around us didn't help.
Fahk. I felt like such an idiot.
And because someone filmed the whole thing—it's now viral on the school platform.
I didn't even think ""Doofus"" was loud enough to hear, but apparently, it was crystal clear on camera.
Just like that, I got a new nickname.
I wanted the bed to swallow me whole. Should I just drop out? I can't keep my grades up anyway.
""Hey, b.tch.""
I knew that voice.
""What do you want, Bee?"" I groaned, buried under my blanket, which was immediately yanked off by Bianca—ready to nag me.
""I can't believe you're sulking in bed just because you got held back a little,"" Bianca snickered.
She wouldn't get it.
She's prettier. Smarter. Her parents don't compare her to a perfect older sibling or remind her she was a mistake.
She didn't grow up being told she wasn't enough.
I didn't even want to study here. I wanted to open a dessert shop. Something small, meaningful.
But that was too much to ask from my parents.
""C'mon, get out of that bed."" She snapped her fingers as if highlighting the sense of urgency. 
""What?"" 
My bitter thoughts were cut off when Bianca sighed heavily, dragged me out of bed, dressed me up, and took me to a downtown strip club to cheer me up despite my grunts, grumbles, and loud protests, I just wish I could stay in bed. 
But we're both fans of the male anatomy... I shouldn't even be here.
I've got a boyfriend—even if things haven't exactly been going well lately.
""Wow, they look fantastic,"" Bee commented, and I finally glanced up from my drink.
The dancers had flawless physiques, moving sensually around poles.
""They're wearing masks?!"" I blurted.
Each dancer had a mask matching their costume—one even had a black Batman mask paired with matching briefs. Sexy? I wasn't sure.
""Apparently, it's the only costume-based strip club in the area. Adds to the mystery,"" Bianca said, eyeing a guy in a monster mask. ""There's something about not seeing their faces—it makes it spicier, y'know?""
But my eyes were glued to something else.
A tattoo.
A small snake curling around the waist of one stripper as he walked off stage.
It had to be a coincidence.
Still, I couldn't stop my legs from moving. I followed him backstage like a lunatic.
""What the fahk am I even doing?"" I whispered. ""It's not him... there's no way.""
What would our class president—our golden boy—be doing in a strip club?
He's too ""holy"" for this place.
Or... so I thought.
""Grayson?!"" I gasped.
Because, of course.
Just when I thought the day couldn't get any better.

/Grayson's POV/
""Ash, you're not up on your game today. Your movement was rigid and sloppy; you'll have to break out more moves if you wanna keep your fans hyped."" Patsy complained and I internally groaned as I watched him walk off with his usual ladylike stride. 
Ecstasy Delight is a lady-owned club where men are laid out like specimens while the ladies gawk at them. 
Not like I've ever had a problem with it since I'm an anonymous stripper. 
It pays the bills so I can't complain. 
""Grayson!"" 
A familiar voice cut through the noise, and I froze.
No one knows me by that name here—I go by Ash.
Who the h.ll…? 
The next 1 min knocked some air out of my lungs as an agonising feeling of dread settled deep inside my stomach, which dropped the moment I turned to see the last person I'd wish to see in that situation. 
I blinked furiously as I watched her pinch her cheeks like she couldn't believe what she was seeing.
Realising she might call my name again, I grabbed her wrist and dragged her into my dressing room. I quickly slipped into a bathrobe in the corner to cover my nudity—since all I had on was the club-issued sexy briefs.
""What the fahk are you doing here, Kithson!? Did you follow me?"" I snapped, horror laced into my tone, masked by a hostile stare and clenched jaw.
 
""The question is, what the fahk are you? Is it even legal for a college student to work here... as a stripper?"" she hissed. 
""Wait—do the professors know you work here? This is unbelievable.""
Her snicker was laced with mockery, her tone thick with scorn. 
Typical Thalia; she was exactly who I thought she was. 
Privileged and ignorant.
She had everything handed to her and no clue how the real world works.
""You're not telling anyone,"" I warned flatly.
She scoffed. ""Watch me!""
She turned to leave but I blocked the door and held her back, my hands a little shaky from the fear that gripped my entire body. 
If Thalia walked out that door and told anyone what I do… I'm definitely screwed. 
My scholarship can only do so much; it wasn't even enough to cover my feeding expenses, if I lose my scholarship because of this, I might have to give up school. 
""You're shaking!? Are you really that scared of me airing your dirty laundry? I can't believe this! You treat everyone else like shllt, like they're beneath you but you're a fahking stripper. Because of you—"" 
She paused, rage lighting up her eyes and in a heated tone, she continued. 
""Because of you the last two years have been nothing but h.ll. All because you happened to be smarter!"" 
She tried to push past me, but I tightened my grip until she winced. 
""Look, I'm sorry, okay… but this is really important to me. You…you can't tell anyone about this, please."" 
My voice wavered at the end.
""Why the fahk should I listen to you!? Because of you, everything I did for the whole year went down the fahking drain. If you'd told me attendance mattered, I'd have attended even if I had to crawl over from my hospital bed, you maron."" She lashed out. 
""Wait, you were at the hospital!?"" My eyes widened in disbelief. 
Thalia Kithson has been nothing more than an irresponsible dork to me since freshman year. 
I saw her parents trying to help her settle at the dorm during freshman year and watching her lash out at them as they gave her everything I wished I had made me envious but instead of taking advantage of that, she partied away and surrounded herself with the worst crowd. 
Everything about her irks me; she was wild and irresponsible, the type of person I abhorred and when she decided she wouldn't be showing up for the project prep, I was more relieved than upset. 
I knew she needed that project to hit her target grade to register for advanced courses next year but I had no intention of piggybacking her through it. 
She had to earn it, unlike me, but I didn't think she was at the hospital. 
""Yeah, you d.ckhead! I was treating my gastritis but you wouldn't know that since all it ever mattered to you was being perfect but I guess you aren't after all!"" She scoffed with a dramatic eye-roll that made me take a step back from her and sigh.
I never claimed to be perfect.
They just assumed I was.
It worked in my favor—I kept my scholarship. And if this semester goes well, I'll get a full grant and another scholarship for next year.
""What exactly do I have to do to make this right? No one can know about this, Thalia. I fahking mean it!"" Desperation seeped into my tone. 
She smirked—scheming. I could already tell.
It didn't matter. I just need to stall until the end of the session anyway. 
""Professor Lovre treasures you a lot. So I'm sure you wouldn't mind fixing my grade.""
""You know I can't do that. With the project already submitted and—""
""Don't give me that bullshlt!"" She snapped. ""Everyone knows how closely you are with the Professors being the class president and all. You asked what I want—this is it. I cannot repeat a fahking year because you think I don't deserve to pass, Grayson, so fix it."" She insisted. 
I sighed. 
""I'm not making any promises, Thalia. This might not work; I don't control them. If anything, they all just wanted a lackey who'd make their job easier; I just happened to be a good fit."" The last parts of my words came in a mumble because I didn't think it was possible to reverse the damage done. 
With the end-of-semester project already concluded and the list of participants already submitted, I thought it was impossible, but Professor Lovre actually listened when I explained it was an error on my part because I thought Thalia didn't send in her research, but she did, and fortunately, she didn't mind since it was my first time making that mistake. 
Even though I didn't use her research and analysis for the project execution, I just wanted to get her off my neck. 
""Happy now?"" I asked when we met in school two days later. ""You've been graded. You're not repeating the course.""
""Maybe,"" she replied smugly as we walked away from the professor's office.
I thought that was it.
But she kept showing up at my shows.
And when I told her to back off, she brought new demands.
I'm already drowning in my assignments and project work as it is, and now I have to do hers. 
""You're unbelievable,"" I declared as she sat on my dresser after one of my shows, her skirt slightly lifted in reaction while I muttered a few silent curses before tearing my eyes from her pale thighs. 
""Why can't you do your own dammmnn work? I'm already swamped as it is,"" I complained for the umpteenth time. 
""For one, you're smarter than me, and two—"" She grinned. ""I know your dirty little secret, so you might wanna put in a little more work if you want me to shut up about it,"" She threatened. 
""Fahking b.tch!"" I muttered under my breath. 
""What was that?"" She arched a brow. 
""Nothing but how long am I gonna have to do this for?"" I demanded. 
She shrugged, hopping down from my dresser in her skimpy skirt and crop top, leather jacket tossed over her shoulder. Her thigh-high boots matched her wi.ne-red shirt.
""I don't know, maybe until I'm satisfied and no longer think you're a fahking je.k."" Was,what she said but her eyes lingered on me more than usual; it's been like that for the past couple of weeks since she found out I worked at Ecstasy Delight. 
Every night I hit that stage, her eyes strangely followed me and even with the masks on, she could always tell my position. 
It still felt uncomfortable rolling around the pole and dropping down on all fours with her eyes following my every movement. 
But I got to understand what it meant when Thalia showed up to my dorm room in tears, her mascara smudged and her hair wet from the rain. 
I was ready to lash out at her if she brought over her fahking work again; it was becoming tiring to keep up with her annoying demands but when she showed up looking like someone chewed her up and spat her out, I didn't know what to do. 
""Are you okay?"" I asked, helping her settle on the shared sofa with my roommate, who fortunately was out tonight. 
""No, I'm not. I just got dumped."" 
Thalia was the honest type, impulsive too… unlike me who had a thousand faces, she wasn't the type to hide, but she didn't need to; she wasn't the orphan fighting to survive. 
""Sorry, I guess,"" I replied as I returned to my desk to finish up my work but I couldn't just leave her sulking on my sofa like some abandoned puppy but I didn't have to; she was already rummaging through my fridge like she owned the place. 
""You've got booze!"" She exclaimed, gulping down my roommate's beer while I groaned from my desk. 
""That's Nathan's,"" I told her but she kept drinking anyway. ""You could have just hit the bar or something. Why come here?"" I complained but instead she handed me a can of beer. 
""No thanks, I'll pass. I've got to finish this tonight. It's due tomorrow,"" I reminded. 
""You are such a killjoy,"" She said with a dramatic eye roll before flopping at the foot of my bed while I wondered how I could get her to leave but when I turned to look at her again, she was shivering. 
She should really get off those clothes. I thought, walking over to the bathroom and returning with a towel, which I draped over her shoulders. 
""You'll catch a cold if you don't head back,"" I told her but…
No response instead Thalia's lips suddenly met mine, leaving me completely frozen still. 
What the fahk? Is she drunk?

I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is, the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.  

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.  

I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:
- Japanese (living in Japan right now, or already in the US)  
- 23–46  
- Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever

Since then I've been pursuing her, planning dates, showing I'm interested. I feel like a woman asking a man out is way less risk. A man will typically be flattered, even if he's not interested.

Ngl I haven’t faffed around with the profiling much. Mainly coz my grinder has loads of retention and tryna dial in while changing pressure and temp variables is quite annoying and wasteful on coffee. Looking to get some kind of single dose grinder at some point. 

Been very happy with the default profile and the “LM” profiles aka 9 bar with 3 sec of pre infusion. 

Hoping to make some money back by using this suitcase and actually getting someone to hire me to barista at their home party or something 😂 if you’re in london hmu.

I’m not trying to rush anything or force a vibe. I just want to know how to talk to her in a way that actually shows some personality and maybe sparks something if there’s natural chemistry. Right now it feels like I’m stuck saying the same generic stuff every day, and it never leads anywhere.

For people who’ve been in similar situations:

How do you bring more life into conversations without overstepping?

What kinds of topics or questions actually help two coworkers connect naturally?

How do you test the waters without making work uncomfortable?


Any perspective would help. I’m not expecting anything, I just want to stop sounding like a robot and see if a real connection is even possible.

Connell closed the email from the university in New York for the fifth time. The offer was life-changing, a clear path to the writing career he desperately wanted. He sat on the edge of the bed in the flat in Dublin, the silence of the afternoon around him.

Marianne came out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on a dish towel. She saw his face and the open laptop screen.

“Did they email back?” she asked softly.

“Yeah,” he said, closing the laptop completely. “It’s good news.”

“So you’re going.” It wasn't a question, just a statement of fact, delivered with the same quiet acceptance she always had regarding his future.

Connell looked up at her, really looked at her, standing there in her worn sweater, hair slightly messy. He thought about New York—the bright lights, the anonymity, the prestige. Then he thought about Dublin—the familiar streets, the comfort of their shared flat, and the easy rhythm of their life together now. He thought about all the years they had spent orbiting each other, struggling to communicate, missing opportunities.

He shook his head slowly. “No.”

Marianne froze. “No? Connell, this is everything you’ve wanted. You have to go. We’ll figure it out. We always do.”

“I’m tired of figuring it out from different cities, Marianne,” he said, his voice raw with emotion he hadn’t intended to show. He stood up and took a step towards her. “I don’t want to be good at being apart anymore. I want to be good at being here.”

She searched his eyes, tears beginning to well up in her own. “Are you sure? Don’t stay for me, Connell. That would be… it wouldn’t be right.”

“It’s not for you,” he said, pulling her into a fierce hug, breathing in the scent of her hair. “It’s for us. I don’t want my life to start over there. My life is here. With you.”

They stayed like that for a long time, the weight of the decision settling around them, not as a sacrifice, but as a commitment.

Four years later, the weather in Dublin was typically grey and drizzly. Inside a cozy, slightly crowded bookshop near Trinity College, the air was warm and smelled of coffee and paper.

A small crowd had gathered for a reading. At the front of the room, behind a podium, stood Connell Waldron. He looked older, more confident, wearing a tweed jacket that Marianne had helped him pick out. The cover of the book beside him read “Thresholds: A Collection of Short Stories,” by Connell Waldron.

He finished his final story, a quiet narrative about two people finding their way back to each other across different social worlds. The room erupted in applause.

As people lined up for signatures, he scanned the crowd until he found her. Marianne was leaning against a bookshelf in the back, smiling, a new pair of stylish glasses perched on her nose. She raised a glass of cheap white wine in a silent toast.

Later, walking home through the quiet Georgian streets, the rain having momentarily stopped, Connell reached for Marianne's hand. It was cold, and he wrapped his fingers around hers tightly.

“Good night,” she said, looking up at the streetlights illuminating the damp pavement. “You were brilliant.”

“It was okay,” he said, deflecting the praise as usual.

“It was better than okay. You’re happy, aren’t you?” she asked, nudging his shoulder.

He stopped walking, pulling her closer under the pale glow of a street lamp. The easy awkwardness of their youth had finally evaporated, replaced by a comfortable, earned silence.

“I am,” he said, smiling, looking at the person who knew him better than anyone in the world. He was a published author with a stable life, in a city he loved, with the only person he’d ever truly needed. He had chosen this quiet, normal life over the endless possibilities of New York, and he didn’t regret it for a second.

They were just two people walking home in the rain in Dublin, no longer wondering about their future, but simply living it. It wasn’t a dramatic life, but it was theirs, and it was enough.
