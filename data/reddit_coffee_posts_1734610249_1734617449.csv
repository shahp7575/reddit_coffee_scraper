Context: 
I walk my dog around my area every day & after years of living here, there are some local coffee shops that have encouraged me to just bring my dog inside when I order. It’s my favorite thing to do & so helpful for my morning routine. 

I’m moving somewhere new soon & would love to be able to do that without waiting months for a coffee shop to notice me walking and invite me inside.

I know there are some (particularly in other cities) where I would call ahead of time & the shop would always say no or get uncomfortable.I’m wondering if this is a case where it’s better to ask forgiveness not permission?

1hhtm7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/1hhtm7d/lease_takeover_for_2526_school_year_campus_village/,LEASE TAKEOVER FOR 25/26 SCHOOL YEAR - CAMPUS VILLAGE,"I am looking for someone to take over my lease starting August 19, 2025 – July 31, 2026 for a bedroom with a private bathroom at Campus Village in a 2-bedroom apartment. If you and a friend are looking for a 2-bedroom apartment, there is also the option of someone taking over the lease for the other bedroom as well. There would be a renewal option as well for the next year directly with the apartment complex.

You would have your own bedroom and bathroom. Apartment comes with a bed, desk, and chair in the bedroom and kitchen barstools, couch, coffee table, and chairs in the living room which is considered the apartment common area, along with air conditioning. Every apartment comes with your own full-size washer & dryer inside the apartment which is a huge bonus.

Rent is $1,010.00 per month plus utilities. The utilities that you pay for each month are Electric, Water, Gas, & Sewer. High Speed Internet and trash removal are included with rent. There is plenty of easy and safe free parking in an outside lot as well as a multi-level parking deck which provides easy access to your apartment. I will pay the $200 lease transfer fee and I will also pay you directly the application fee of $135.00 after the lease takeover is finalized. 

Campus Village is right next door to the Brody Neighborhood at Michigan State University, close to Spartan Stadium, and close to Grand River. Your classes are a short walk or bike ride away. There is also easy access to the CATA MSU bus line from this apartment complex. Some amenities at the apartment complex are a yoga room, 24-hour fitness center, community lounge, study rooms, computer lab with free printing, outside cooking station, outdoor furnished patio area and free coffee daily. 

I can tell you from my experience this year at this apartment complex that the staff is amazing and helpful when needed and they are very attentive to promptly taking care of any maintenance issues that may come up. The apartments are move-in ready, modern, and CLEAN! 

I am including layout photos of the 2-bedroom apartment options as the apartment has not been assigned yet by Campus Village. (I am currently in a 4 bedroom and was moving to a 2 bedroom for the 25/26 school year) The apartment will be made ready for your arrival by Campus Village just like moving into a newly ready apartment (because it is!). I am also including some photos of what my current apartment looks like as the layouts are very similar so that would give you a good idea. 

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask me anything! I can always personally send you more photos if you would like as well. This apartment complex has been an amazing place to live and I am so sad to have to be moving on from it. Leaving here was not what I wanted to do but sometimes, life happens.

1hhtltm,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hhtltm/quit_my_job_without_telling_anyone/,Quit my job without telling anyone,"I’ve been a SAHM with our two kids for quite a bit. I recently decided to get back to work, against my husbands suggestions on waiting until after our vacation in February. Well, I hated it. I landed a dream job. Dream position. Dream pay. And it was just not enough. My family felt like it was falling apart; my kids didn’t adjust to daycare well, they were getting violently sick (something we’ve NEVER dealt with), my partner and I had no time together, the house was a mess, we had no time to cook or grocery shop, I had physically started to see effects from all of this, the days would be 10+ hours. When I say my head was not above water, it feels like I’ve been in a different world since I’ve started this job. So this morning, I quit effective immediately. I did not tell my husband. I actually didn’t tell anyone. I’m hiding out in a coffee shop for the day as my MIL watches my children in our home two days a week- one being today, and I don’t want her to tell my husband before I do. He’s not the type to get angry, I just know he wanted me to give the job a longer chance. We were financially fine- it was simply me wanting to get out of the house, which I’d rather not if it comes at the expense of my children and family. Guess I’m just looking for helpful words before I tell anyone close to me. ",0,1734617107.0,jobs,0,0.5,False

We adopted our 6 mo pup last week and she’s been absolutely lovely. In fact, I feel a bit guilty posting this here as she hasn’t been very challenging at all up until this point. She just completed her vaccinations and we were able to take her for a walk. I was shocked that she started freaking out at every dog we saw, even the ones that ignored her — hackles raised, barking and growling, adopting an aggressive stance. 

It came as a surprise, since she’s so calm at home, has never barked, gets along with the cat and other visiting dogs. 

I’m planning to work with a behaviorist after the holidays, but I’m hoping someone with knowledge of leash frustration (from what I’ve read, this seems to be the case, but I could be wrong) might provide me with some advice on what we can do in the meantime. I’m worried that every walk we take where this goes unaddressed will exacerbate the problem. 

I won’t lie, I’m feeling a sense of loss. I had hoped to be able to take her with me to walk in the park, to visit friends at coffee shops, etc. I am 100% committed to meeting her where she is and adapting my expectations to her needs, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t make me sad.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

1hhtisg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1hhtisg/blogging_for_ad_revenue/,Blogging for Ad Revenue,"Alright, let’s dive into the whirlwind world of online entrepreneurship, shall we? Finding a profitable niche feels a bit like treasure hunting—thrilling and nerve-wracking all at once. You want to dig for that goldmine without falling into a pit of over-saturated seaweed. So, how do you go about it? The trick is to marry your passions with market demand. Think about what lights that little spark in your soul but also has eyes looking for it. Is it a love for mushroom foraging? Perhaps a knack for teaching rescue dog training? Good news, you won’t be left paddling alone in the sea of niche selection! Tools like Google Trends and keyword research can be your compass, guiding you toward those golden opportunities with traffic flowing like a well-timed comedy punchline.

Now, let’s transition from niche hunting to building your digital storefront. Enter WordPress—the Swiss Army knife of website-building. Whether you're looking to whip up a simple blog or a full-fledged online course platform, it's got your back. It’s user-friendly enough that even someone like me—who once contemplated how to assemble IKEA furniture for a full week—can navigate it without breaking a sweat. And the best part? It’s often free to start! Sure, you might want to throw a few bucks at premium themes or hosting down the line, but starting off without financial commitment is fantastic. Just picture it: you, a warm cup of coffee, a cozy blanket, and the vast expanse of digital possibility before you. 

Okay, you’ve selected your niche and crafted your oasis in the internet desert, but how do you get folks to actually visit? Here’s where the magic happens. Content marketing is your friend—think high-quality blog posts, headlines that pop like popcorn, and SEO that’s more on-point than a college student cramming for exams. You want your content to serve, be it through tutorials, engaging stories, or insightful commentary. Dive into social media too; platforms like Instagram or TikTok can be your secret weapon to reach a broader audience. And don’t underestimate the power of community! Engage with others in your niche—comment, share, and find collaborators. A rising tide lifts all boats, after all.

Lastly, let’s circle back to faith for a hot second. As you step into this entrepreneurial journey, remember that it's about saying ""yes"" to the opportunities presented to you and trusting the process. Some days will feel like climbing a mountain with roller skates on, while others will feel like walking on water—sometimes literally! Embrace both the struggles and the victories. After all, you never really know how God’s plan will play out amidst the chaos of life—so roll up those sleeves, get building, and enjoy the ride!",1,1734616874.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

Most of us have been there the night before a deadline or an exam.

I know I have, on numerous occasions. But don’t worry I’m not going to tell you to plan better or make better use of your time.

1. Because its pointless. You’re likely reading this because you’re already cramming… so it’s too late for hindsight and kicking yourself for not getting on with it earlier. What’s done is done.

*and*

2. Because some people thrive on the energy and adrenaline of working close to deadlines.

I am one of those people.

Sometimes I wish I wasn’t. But I’ve come to realise through years of school, college and uni, plus additional qualifications and certifications, that it is actually when I do my best work. I thrive on a tight deadline. It forces me into clarity and stops me overanalysing my work.

But, as much as I’m not here to tell you to study sooner, I will say that it will have a negative impact on your sleep, and therefore your energy.

So if you’re staying up late to study, here’s how to switch off and get a good night’s sleep:

# 1. Let go of what you’ll feel like tomorrow

It’s tempting to worry about how tired you’ll feel tomorrow and beat yourself up for staying up late.

We’re adaptable to different sleep patterns and can cope with reduced sleep in the short term. So, release the worry of how you’ll feel when you wake up, and remind yourself that’ll you be just fine.

# 2. Screens off

The blue light emitted from laptops, phones and TVs will keep you wired and although I used to fall asleep to the TV a lot when I was at uni, I wouldn’t recommend it.

Try and switch all your screens off and even turn your phone off once you’ve set an alarm. It helps create a definite break between work, and rest and your brain won’t be affected by the light.

# 3. Fresh air

Your room can get stuffy whilst you’re studying, so either open the window and let the temperature drop a little or go for a little walk outside.

The fresh air will clear your head and your body will drift off quicker if your environment is cooler.

# 4. 10 minutes quiet time

Shutting up your books, then jumping under the covers immediately may not be the best approach to getting some decent shut eye.

Chill your mind by listening to peaceful music, meditating or reading something non-study related.

Just 10 minutes will help you detach from revision mode.

# 5. The right light 

As with turning off screens, your lighting can affect your sleep. Scientists who study sleep patterns suggest dimming the lights 15 minutes before sleep and then aiming for as dark an environment as possible, with as few distractions (ticking noises, little LED lights on devices etc) as possible.

# 6. Plan your timing right

Have you heard of the 90 minute sleep cycle? It’s the average length of a cycle within your sleeping period.

It’s suggested that if you wake up mid-cycle you’re much more likely to be in deep sleep and struggle with getting up and feeling refreshed.

Try to work your way backwards from your desired waking time in 90 minute chunks – this will give you the optimum bedtime. E.g – want to wake up at 7:30am and it’s 11:30pm now? Try aiming to nod off around midnight and you’ll have 7 cycles and should wake up more refreshed.

# 7. An alternative to counting sheep 

Counting sheep has never worked for me. I just get bored and frustrated with the whole concept.

What I do find useful is focusing my attention inwards whilst I lie in bed. I notice the way the duvet feels on my skin, the softness of the pillow, the sound of my breathing. By noticing and focusing on my immediate environment and my body, I find I drift off naturally in no time.",1,1734616850.0,StudentBrainpower,0,1.0,False

1hhti6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1hhti6r/odd_groundneutral_voltage/,Odd ground/neutral voltage ,"Hey guys, weird situation here. US-based 120v residential, already engaged an electrician and having work done, but I'm curious about the root issue and possible causes. 

I went to plug in my toaster the other day, and when my hand touched the toaster and the coffee grinder at the same time, the appliances themselves were hot and zipped me. The toaster and the grinder are the only two three-prong appliances on the four-plug outlet, and the other two appliances seemed fine. The issue did NOT follow the appliances to another outlet. 

Electrician comes yesterday, and shows me that when bridging ground wires or neutral to ground, there's just over 60v present. 

Can someone hypothesize about where that voltage could be coming from, and why it's only 60v instead of the full 120? Something to do with the phases? 

This isn't something I've ever even heard of, so I'm kinda at a loss.

We realised early on that it was easier for him to use a step stool to reach what he needed in the kitchen than for me to constantly be crouching to get what I need as that gets painful quickly for me.

This was fine, until my MIL came to stay with us two weeks ago. Her roof needs repairs, my husband and I have a spare room while my best friend doesn't so it was only logical she come stay with us. She has constantly been moving things about in the kitchen, lowering items as she doesn't want to use the step stool, which isn't anything to do with her age or fearing she'll fall she just doesn't want to. She keeps harping on about how it's ridiculous everything is so high up and it's rude for guests. My husband has repeatedly shut her down stating my comfort matters more than theoretical guests and asked her not to move things. She lets it go for a day then things are moved again. 

I've expressed frustration to my Husband about this and the final straw came today when I went to make myself a coffee and could not find my coffee mugs anywhere, it took me five minutes to find them in my kitchen and I found them in the lower cabinet that I had to kneel to get them out of. I was angry and snappish at this as my back had hurt from getting my mug, and I told her if she couldn't stop herself from rearranging my kitchen she could get a hotel room as I have had enough of her entitlement. 

This led to a lot of blustering and some tears that she was just trying to make it make more sense and how this is her sons home and how it's just a little reorganisation and that they shouldn't all suffer just because i'm tall, she then also began to say how i'm heartless to expect her to stay in a hotel over the holidays. 

My Husband was clearly uncomfortable at this and didn't want his Mother upset but he told her that it wasn't just his home, but mine too and if she wouldn't respect my comfort and happiness then she would have to leave. She has went into the guest room and I can hear her crying still. My Husband is clearly getting anxious and upset over this but he's not backing down and I feel awful that my snapping led to him feeling like this, maybe I should have just put up with it or been more gentle about how I dealt with it? I honestly don't care that she's upset which may make me sound heartless but I hate that my Husband is feeling this way.",48,1734616466.0,AmItheAsshole,33,0.91,False

Should I suggest a test for NALFD? They've done all the diets for the stomach and nothing has worked but NONE have said to cut out sugar. They've said to cut out corn syrup or to cut out gluten and then he'll just have gluten-free treats....

I am very sociable and you don't necessarily have to share the same interests and hobbies as myself, but always a plus if you do. Also great if you're around my age or a few years either side; 23+. The emphasis is on even if we just end up having a great conversation and/or click, it's a win.

I'm a movie enthusiast, a avid book reader (just finished Neil Gaiman's Norse Mythology, mixed feelings on it). I have a passion for storytelling; I write creatively as a hobbie. I like nature walks, theatre, cinema, coffee shops, museums, art galleries, crazy golf and more. I'm really versatile. I do like some pubs and bars, but my nightclub days are over. I don't miss it in earnest.

1hht9vd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nicotinefreenotes/comments/1hht9vd/day_1/,Day - 1,"Day 1 of My Journey

Yesterday, I made the decision to quit smoking and attempted to go cold turkey. However, it wasn’t as effective as I had hoped. For years, I’ve been accustomed to smoking 30 cigarettes a day, with my routine starting every morning with coffee and 4-5 cigarettes. My day then continues with two more during breaks on the way to work, followed by 6-7 cigarettes at lunch, and 8-10 more before dinner. This has been my pattern for as long as I can remember.

Today, however, was different. I managed to smoke only 5 cigarettes – 2 in the morning and 3 in the evening before dinner. I even made the shift from my usual Marlboro to a new brand, Define cigarettes. Despite my dependence on nicotine, I’m proud of how I handled the day. The urge to smoke hit me hardest around 11-12 and during lunch, but I was able to distract myself by taking a nap during those times. 

Staying home all day made it slightly easier, but I know the real challenge lies ahead. Tomorrow will truly test my willpower and tolerance to nicotine, especially since I won’t have the comfort of being at home. While I’m not entirely satisfied with my performance today, I know it’s a step in the right direction, and I am grateful for the progress I’ve made, however small. I’m determined to keep going and work through the cravings. 

Here's to another day of progress.",1,1734616134.0,nicotinefreenotes,0,1.0,False

1hht9bp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/1hht9bp/red_shells_and_coffee/,Red shells and coffee ,"Last night before I went to sleep I asked the universe to tell me anything I needed to know in my dreams.

I ended up having a dream where I was on the beach with my daughter (2yo) and my most recent ex (not my kid's dad). 
I was paddling in the shallow parts of the sea with my daughter and jumping in and out as the tide came in slowly.
Then we saw a beautiful reddish pink shell and went to pick it up, it was a really big whelk shell and it was in perfect condition, I excitedly showed it to my ex and we all went to look for more. We kept coming across lots of big and very beautifully coloured reddish/pink shells, and collected a few. There were other families and people at the beach too and some of them were collecting the shells too.
All of them were perfect condition, not a single chip or anything. 
I then went to pick another one up and it was a piece of glazed ham that was shaped like a shell, I laughed and was very confused and we left it there and found more actual shells. Then we decided to leave, and for some reason we had to walk through an indoor swimming pool to get where we needed to go. The pool way empty but clear, and there were two lifeguards there. I grabbed my daughters hand as we walked past because I didn't want her to fall in, and then my ex suggested we go and get coffee. We both got a black coffee and then I said to him ""well black coffee is a sign of strength and energy building, unlike white coffee which is diluted"". 
The next day in the dream my kids were at school/nusery and I went to meet up with my ex again, and his friend. We sat down in a cafe and all got a coffee, then his friend told me I'm not very feminine, my ex told her to not say that because I don't like it. Then I told her I grew up without a mum because she abandoned me, so I never got taught how to do makeup or do my hair nicely, but actually on the inside I'm very feminine and lots of my interests are quite feminine too.
She then showed me a picture of her mum, who had rotting teeth and messy hair and her mums boyfriends who looked scruffy and told they died in a car accident. Then my ex said his mum was dead too (in the waking world her mum isn't dead and neither is his). I said my mum isn't actually dead, she's just not around. Then I woke up.  (my mum actually wasn't around when I grew up, for added context to that appearing in my dream). 

I'm struggling to work out what all this means together, the dream felt positive overall and I felt happy in the dream and everyone else was happy too.

I am 100% aware that heartburn would be present during pregnancy but idk if this is within the realm of 'every pregnancy is different' as some info sources suggest that it tones down after 12-16 weeks.

I am 16 weeks pregnant and have heartburn every day, sometimes all day. Sometimes it´s a mild burn, other times its painful cause I misbehaved and had something to eat that I shouldn't have. (like a bite of chocolate or half a cup of coffee, which I promise happens like once every 2 or 3 weeks) Sometimes food that trigger me feel completely fine other times. I am not overweight (5'2'' and 119kg) I try to chew gum, sip milk, aloe or cold water (a third of a cup very slowly) to manage the burn. I don't lay down for 2-3 hours after eating. I try to eat 'refreshing' or 'low-acid' fruit to help, like cucumber, watermelon and papaya. Doctor even recommended those gel sachets to manage it, but they provide relief only up to an hour.

My next appointment is this coming week. My doctor has only 'strictly' prohibited bread from my diet. As in, ""if you eat this, it can make your heartburn worse"", so I avoid cookies and similar products as much as I can.

But sometimes, the heartburn is too much and incredibly painful. Things that I feel I might not be managing as well: foods with tomato sauce, cheese or processed snacks. Which I had none of last night.

And I had my worst time with it yet; yesterday it felt as if my stomach acid had just burst up my esophagus for no reason and woke me up immediately. I didn't even feel intense heartburn when I went to bed but there I was with a REALLY bad burning sensation. I tried to drink some juice (which might have been the bad move) and when that didn't work, I took one of the sachets which immediately turned my whole stomach upside down and I threw up (Since the taste of hearburn medicine yucks me out a bit). There was nothing in my stomach but the acid and the juice, I must have thrown up about 2-3 cups of liquid with the tiniest specks of what looked like food. It was so acidic that the residue that got in my airways felt burning in my nose. I was having a horrible and painful time. 

Please help. I am losing weight cause I don't eat as much as I liked to before the pregnancy because im scared of being in pain all the time and having episodes like last night. I feel terrible cause I know my baby girl needs the nutrients.

She doesn’t want to let him in, pretending she had ‘wild night with chad,’ but he doesn’t believe it.

For context, I am a pizza guy and coming from Europe my expectations were quite high. 

I began my journey at Pequod’s, I got the 16” deep dish, no toppings, just cheese and sauce. I sat at the bar and waited for about 50’. This pizza is definitely in the top 5 I’ve ever had but the sauce itself was easily the best tomato sauce I’ve had on any food. It was so good that I took some leftovers and had the for breakfast the next day and it still tasted fresh and great, OMG!!! 5/5 

Next on the list is Lou Mitchell’s where I visited for breakfast. It was very busy but managed to find a spot at the bar. The ambience was amazing, families and friends chatting and having fun. The waitress took awhile to come get my order but the food arrived quickly. I got the pecan pancakes and was also served some kind of dough ball which I didn’t ask for, plus some ice cream at the end. The dough ball was meh but edible, the pancakes were VERY nice, thick and fluffy and I appreciated the huge jars of maple syrup on the counter. The biggest letdown was the ice cream, it was disgusting. I would visit again but I’d try something new, the guy next to me was having some sort of huge omelette with different meats? 4/5

I then went to Phil’s Pizza for dinner, the place was pretty much empty but I saw many customers, which I assumed were regulars, picking up their orders and leaving. It is cash only but I was pleasantly surprised to see an ATM inside. The toilets were filthy but the rest of the place was clean and the lady at the counter was very friendly. I got a large cheese pizza and a can of coke. Great pizza, with some similarities to the NYC style. 5/5

My choice of breakfast for the next morning was Uncle Mike’s, the Filipino joint. I got some sort of rice porridge with garlic and lemons, the longanisa and a coffee. The staff were great and the place very clean. I wasn’t wowed by the food but that’s a personal preference and doesn’t reflect on the food quality. 3/5

Giordano’s.. I don’t want to offend anyone as I think it’s an institution so I won’t comment further, won’t be back. 1/5

Wilberry and Yolk were OK but I wasn’t impressed much. I had the vegan hash at Wilberry and an omelette at Yolk. Service was fine at both. 3/5

During my visit to Chinatown, which I have to say I liked more than NYC’s, I visited the Triple Crown on the Main Street. I got a Tsingtao (spelling?) and some sort of fish in an oily soup full of chillies, plus a side bowl of rice. The place was empty when I visited but got full soon after. The food was delicious but too damn spicy! Staff were attentive and filled my glass with water all the time. 4/5 would visit again but try something new. Side note: I did some walking and found another restaurant with the same name, Triple Crown - The Original Place, or something along these lines, in a street perpendicular to the main one. Was the place I visited a ripoff? What’s the deal? 

Honourable mention to Emerald City Coffee which I discovered by accident whilst walking in the area. It was cheap, had great ambience and both the coffee and the cinnamon roll were excellent. 5/5 but far away.

There are so many more places I want to visit on a future visit but these will have to do for now. Overall I had a great experience, city and food wise. A thing I noticed and slightly annoyed me was that I couldn’t grab a seat and chill, they wanted us out of there asap unless we kept ordering stuff. This is true for all the places we visited.

------------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is essential for maintaining optimal health and wellness. You might often wonder, “How much water should I drink each day?” The answer varies, but the general recommendation is about 8-10 cups (or around 2-2.5 liters). However, factors like age, weight, climate, and activity level may influence your daily water needs. Understanding your body's specific requirements can transform your health significantly.

### Why Water is Crucial for Your Health

Water plays a vital role in your body's functions. It aids digestion, keeps your skin healthy, and regulates body temperature. When you drink enough water, you help your body absorb nutrients more efficiently and flush out toxins. Without adequate hydration, you could experience fatigue, headaches, and decreased concentration.

### Signs You Need More Water

Many people don’t realize they’re dehydrated. Here are some common signs to watch out for:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Thirst: Feeling thirsty is your body’s first signal that you need more water.
- Dark Urine: If your urine is dark yellow, it often means you're dehydrated.
- Dry Skin: Lack of moisture can lead to dry, flaky skin.
- Fatigue: Low energy levels may be due to insufficient water intake.
- Headaches: Dehydration can trigger headaches and migraines.

The Impact of Hydration on Mental Clarity and Focus
---------------------------------------------------

Staying properly hydrated is essential for everyone, but did you know that it has a direct impact on your mental clarity and focus? When your body lacks sufficient water, cognitive functions can be compromised, leading to decreased mental performance, slower reactions, and impaired memory. Let’s dive deeper into how drinking enough water daily can transform your mental clarity and focus.

### Understanding the Importance of Hydration

Your brain is made up of about 75% water. This means that even mild dehydration can hinder your brain's function. When you're dehydrated, it affects neurotransmitter production, essential for communication between brain cells. This disruption can lead to irritation, stress, and an inability to focus.

### Signs of Dehydration Affecting Mental Clarity

Recognizing the symptoms of dehydration is crucial for maintaining optimal cognitive function. Some common signs include:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Difficulty concentrating
- Memory problems
- Increased fatigue
- Headaches
- Mood fluctuations

If you experience any of these symptoms, it might be time to assess your water intake. Staying attentive to these warning signs can help you maintain mental clarity.

### How Much Water Should You Drink Daily?

The common recommendation is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, known as the “8x8 rule.” However, the actual amount of water you need can vary based on several factors:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Your age
- Activity level
- Health status
- Environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity)

Many health experts suggest aiming for around 3.7 liters (or about 13 cups) for men and 2.7 liters (about 9 cups) for women daily. Adjust this amount based on your individual needs and monitor how your body responds.

### The Science Behind Hydration and Mental Performance

Research consistently shows that even mild dehydration can lead to decreased cognitive functioning. A study published in the journal *Physiology &amp; Behavior* found that participants who experienced just a 2% drop in body water weight reported headaches and fatigue, along with a noticeable decline in cognitive performance. Proper hydration supports:

- **Improved Focus:** Staying hydrated increases blood flow and oxygen to your brain, enhancing your ability to concentrate.
- **Boosted Memory:** Drinking enough water supports cognitive processes involved in memory storage and recall.
- **Stress Reduction:** Dehydration can elevate cortisol levels, leading to increased anxiety. Proper hydration helps regulate stress responses.

### Ways to Stay Hydrated

Staying hydrated doesn't mean you have to drink plain water all day. a variety of hydrating options into your routine can make it easier and more enjoyable:

- **Water-rich Foods:** Include fruits and vegetables like watermelon, cucumbers, oranges, and lettuce in your diet.
- **Herbal Teas:** Sip on caffeine-free herbal teas for hydration benefits without the jitters.
- **Add Flavor:** If you find plain water boring, infuse it with lemon, mint, or berries for a refreshing twist.
- **Set Reminders:** Use apps or alarms on your phone as reminders to drink water at regular intervals.

### The Connection Between Hydration and Daily Tasks

When you’re well-hydrated, you’re more likely to perform daily tasks efficiently. Tasks such as working on a project, studying for exams, and even engaging in conversations become more manageable when your mind is clear. In contrast, dehydration can lead to procrastination and difficulty multitasking. Therefore, maintaining hydration becomes a crucial aspect of your daily routine.

Adequate hydration into your lifestyle can do wonders for your mental clarity and focus. By paying attention to your body's needs and making simple adjustments to your daily water intake, you can experience significant improvements in cognitive function and overall wellness.

In essence, staying hydrated not only benefits your physical health but also enhances your mental capabilities, making it a key player in maintaining focus and clarity throughout your day.

Understanding the Link Between Water Intake and Physical Performance
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, but did you know that understanding how much water you need can significantly impact your physical performance? Whether you’re an athlete, a weekend warrior, or simply someone who enjoys an active lifestyle, staying properly hydrated plays a crucial role in maintaining optimal performance.

Your body is made up of about 60% water. This vital fluid is involved in nearly every bodily function, from regulating body temperature to aiding digestion and supporting joint health. When you exercise, your body loses water through sweat and respiration, which means you need to replenish it to function at your best.

So, how much water should you drink? While recommendations can vary based on age, weight, and activity level, a common guideline is to aim for at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, known as the ""8x8 rule."" However, for those who are physically active, this number may not be enough. Here’s how to determine a more personalized approach:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Body Weight:** A general rule of thumb is to drink half your body weight in ounces. For instance, if you weigh 150 pounds, aim for around 75 ounces of water a day.
- **Exercise Intensity:** The more intensely you exercise, the more water you’ll need. If you’re doing heavy workouts, consider adding an extra 12-16 ounces for every hour of exercise.
- **Environmental Conditions:** Hot and humid weather can increase your sweating, making it necessary to adjust your water intake accordingly.

Proper hydration is linked directly to physical performance. When you are well-hydrated, you can expect:

- **Improved Endurance:** Staying hydrated helps to maintain your body’s fluid balance, which is essential for muscle function. It allows you to perform longer and push harder.
- **Enhanced Strength:** Dehydration can lead to muscle fatigue and decreased strength. Drinking enough water ensures your muscles are properly nourished and ready to work.
- **Better Recovery:** After an intense workout, hydration can help speed up recovery by flushing out toxins and reducing muscle soreness.

But how do you know if you're drinking enough water? Your body gives you several signals, some of which include:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Thirst:** First and foremost, listen to your body. If you're feeling thirsty, it's time to drink.
- **Urine Color:** A simple way to check hydration is by observing the color of your urine. Light yellow usually indicates good hydration, while a darker color can indicate dehydration.

Remember, various factors can influence your hydration needs. Are you consuming a lot of caffeine? Caffeine is a diuretic, so you may need to drink additional water to compensate. Are you pregnant or breastfeeding? Your water requirements will increase. Always listen to your body and adjust accordingly.

If you find it challenging to drink water regularly, consider incorporating these strategies:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Flavor It Up:** If plain water feels dull, add lemon, lime, or cucumber for flavor.
- **Set Reminders:** Use smartphone apps or alarms to remind you to drink water throughout the day.
- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Having a bottle on hand makes it easier to sip throughout the day, whether at work or while exercising.

Your water intake can also be affected by the foods you eat. For instance, fruits and vegetables like watermelon, cucumbers, and oranges contain high water content and can help keep you hydrated. On the other hand, overly salty or sugary foods may require you to drink more water to counterbalance their dehydrating effects.

Ultimately, understanding the link between water intake and physical performance is vital for anyone looking to enhance their overall health and fitness levels. By keeping your body well-hydrated, you not only enhance your physical performance but also boost your mental clarity and emotional resilience. Remember: hydration is a simple but powerful way to support your overall wellness.

Common Myths About Hydration and Drinking Water
-----------------------------------------------

When it comes to hydration, many people often hold onto common myths that can lead to confusion or unhealthy practices. Understanding the truths about drinking water can not only enhance your knowledge but also improve your overall health and wellness. Let’s explore some of these misconceptions and replace them with facts that will empower you.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 1: You Must Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day

While you might have heard the rule that you need to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day, this is more of a guideline than a strict requirement. Individual water needs vary based on factors such as:

- **Age:** Younger people may need more water due to higher activity levels.
- **Climate:** Hot or humid weather can increase the need for hydration.
- **Activity Level:** Exercise and physical labor necessitate higher water intake.

Instead of fixating on a specific amount, listen to your body's signals and drink when you are thirsty.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 2: All Beverages Hydrate You Equally

It’s easy to think that any drink can keep you hydrated, but this isn’t entirely correct. While most beverages contribute to your daily fluid intake, some drinks might have a diuretic effect. For example, caffeinated drinks like coffee and soda can lead to increased urine output. Instead of counting these drinks as part of your water intake, focus on pure water for optimal hydration.

### Myth 3: You Can Only Stay Hydrated by Drinking Water

This myth overlooks the fact that many foods contribute to your hydration levels. Fruits and vegetables, such as cucumbers, tomatoes, and watermelons, are packed with water. Including these in your diet can significantly help with your overall hydration, especially if you’re not a fan of drinking plain water.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 4: You Should Drink Water Only When You Feel Thirsty

While thirst is a crucial signal of your body's need for water, waiting until you’re thirsty can lead to dehydration. It's better to develop a routine for drinking water throughout the day. Try carrying a water bottle with you or setting reminders to take sips regularly, ensuring your body has the fluids it needs to function optimally.

### Myth 5: Hydration is Not Important During Winter

Cooler months might not make you feel as thirsty, but this doesn’t mean your body doesn’t need hydration. In fact, indoor heating can lead to dehydration. Make it a habit to drink water, even if you don’t feel thirsty, and consider enjoying warm herbal teas to help keep you hydrated.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 6: Drinking Water Before Meals Will Help You Lose Weight

Many believe that drinking water before meals can significantly boost weight loss. While it may help you feel fuller and potentially lead to lower calorie intake, it’s not a magic solution for weight loss. Maintenance of a balanced diet and regular physical activity are crucial for effective weight management.

### Myth 7: You Can Overhydrate

Most people do not have to worry about drinking too much water, but it is possible in extreme cases. Overhydration, or hyponatremia, occurs when excessive water intake dilutes sodium levels in the blood. This can happen during certain endurance activities, so it's essential to balance water intake with electrolytes if you are exercising for extended periods.

### Rethink Your Hydration Strategy

Now that you know the truth behind these myths, reevaluating your hydration habits might be beneficial. Make an effort to:

- Incorporate more hydrating foods in your diet.
- Pay attention to your body’s hydration signals.
- Establish a consistent water-drinking routine.
- Be mindful of the beverages you consume.

By separating fact from fiction, you can develop a healthier approach to hydration that boosts your health and wellness. Remember, staying hydrated is key to feeling your best!

### Set Daily Goals

One effective way to boost your water intake is to set clear, achievable goals. Start by determining how much water you aim to drink each day. A common recommendation is to aim for eight 8-ounce glasses, also known as the ""8x8 rule."" Keep a water bottle beside you and make it a target to refill it multiple times during the day. Tracking your consumption through your phone or a dedicated app can also motivate you to reach your goals.

### Flavor Your Water

If plain water does not excite you, consider adding some natural flavor. Infusing your water with fruits, herbs, or vegetables makes it more enjoyable to drink. Here are a few ideas:

- **Lemon or Lime:** A squeeze of citrus can brighten up your hydration.

### Use a Visual Reminder

Sometimes, we simply forget to drink water during our busy days. Setting visual reminders can greatly help.

### Carry a Reusable Water Bottle

Investing in a good-quality, reusable water bottle can make a huge difference. Choose one that fits comfortably in your hand or fits in your car cup holder. This way, it's easier to carry it everywhere—you’re more likely to drink water if it’s always within reach. Some bottles even have marked lines that indicate the amount of water consumed throughout the day, providing an additional visual aid to track your progress.

### Drink Before Every Meal

Creating a habit can effectively increase your water consumption. Make it a rule to drink a glass of water before every meal. Not only does this help you stay hydrated, but it can also assist with portion control, as drinking water can create a feeling of fullness. Additionally, drinking water before meals can aid in digestion.

Incorporate drinking water into your daily routine by pairing it with other activities. For instance:

- Drink water after brushing your teeth.
- Have a glass after every bathroom break.
- Take a sip during your favorite TV show or while reading a book.

Creating associations with everyday activities makes drinking water feel more natural and less like a chore.

- **Watermelon:** This delicious fruit is about 92% water.
- **Cucumbers:** They are very hydrating and low in calories.
- **Strawberries:** These berries are tasty and around 91% water.

### Personalize Your Experience

Every individual is different, and what works for one person may not work for another. Experiment with different techniques until you find what best fits your lifestyle. Consider factors such as your activity level, climate, and personal preferences. You might discover that drinking room temperature water feels better for you than chilling it, or that adding herbs inspires you to drink more.

With these simple strategies, increasing your daily water consumption will become easier and more enjoyable. Stay hydrated and feel the positive impact on your health and wellness!

Alright, music lovers, let’s pull up a chair and have a little chat about *music marketing*. If you’re an artist, producer, or even just a music geek nerding out over strategy, you know marketing often feels like that weird older cousin in the music family—technically related but definitely hard to connect with. I get it. You’re in this to create, not to push product. But here’s the thing: Your music deserves an audience, and it’s not going to magically land in their ears unless you make the first move.

So, let’s break it down together. Think of your music career as a stage. Writing, playing, and recording? That’s your *art*. Marketing? That’s the spotlight, the megaphone, the thing that helps people even know your stage exists. It doesn’t have to suck, I promise. Here’s how to make peace with music marketing and even make it kinda… fun? Stick with me.

---

**First rule of music marketing:** You’re not selling music. You’re offering *an experience.*  

- Selling songs for $0.99/download is old news. People stream now, they vibe to playlists, they connect with you (yes, *you*) on a deeper emotional level.  
- Think about your favorite artists. They don’t just sell music, right? They sell moods, aesthetics, lifestyles, *stories*. You’ve got the same opportunity.  

So what are you offering? Late-night tear-your-heart-out ballads? Dance-your-face-off bangers? Spotify playlist fuel for coffee shops? Start with what makes *your music* unique and go hard.  

---

**Social media = Free Gig Space**  

- Yeah, I know we’re all a little over “the socials.” But hear me out: TikTok, Instagram, YouTube—those spots are just your free stage with a global audience. There’s zero reason *not* to be there sharing your music.  
- Think of these platforms as your testing ground. Drop snippets, share BTS (behind the scenes) vids of songwriting, remix popular sounds to sneak in your style—it’s all fair game.  
- And seriously, chill about “looking perfect.” Messy bedroom covers get way more attention than glossy, overproduced promo clips most of the time. Be *relatable*. Be *you*.  

And PLEASE engage with people! Reply to comments, shout out your biggest fans, run silly polls. Building actual *relationships* turns casual listeners into lifelong supporters.  

---

**Don’t underestimate your story.**  

People want **connection** more than an MP3. What drew you into making music? Did you have to grind through tough times? Maybe music saved your life—or maybe your songs are all about turning mundane stuff (like waiting for the bus!) into art.  

SHARE THAT STORY. Drop it into posts, interviews, or even random tweets. Let them know who you are *behind* those tracks. That kind of personal connection sticks.  

---

**Build your rabbit hole.**  

Here’s the dream: Someone hears one of your tracks on a playlist or TikTok video, goes “Whoa, this SLAPS,” and then falls down an endless rabbit hole of your music and online presence. BUT only if there’s one to fall into.  

Checklist time:  
- A smart, clickable bio on all your socials  
- A pinned post that screams, “Hi! This is me and my music in 15 seconds!”  
- A YouTube setup with live vids, song breakdowns, acoustic covers  
- Merch. Even a basic DIY shirt. People love repping stuff they love.  

---

**Email Isn’t Dead. Don’t Forget About The Old-School Crew.**  

Emails, newsletters, and mailing lists might *feel* ancient, but they’re actually key. You don’t own your followers on social media (wild, right?). Platforms change algorithms or ban you, and poof—your fans are gone. Your email list is *yours.*  

- Set one up with something like Mailchimp or Substack.  
- Offer exclusive content (first dibs on new songs, personal messages, demo leaks) as a reward for signing up.  

---

**Collab Your Face Off**  

Your dream for marketing doesn’t have to live in a bubble. Work with other artists. Hit up that TikTok dance creator and let them use your music. Find photographers who vibe with your sound—what if they start linking you in their posts?  

Collabs = new audiences. It’s that simple.  

---

**Most Important of All: Have Fun With It.**

I’ve been in the Apple ecosystem for most of my whole university career (Bachelor, Master, PhD, postdoc…). Over the years I made many different calendars (seminars, lab events, private plans, appointments, professional development opportunities, scheduled writing time, etc.) and the many calendar system was awesome for also for managing my ADHD. 

I’m leaving that career now and would like to “hide” these older calendars so that when I make an entry for a coffee with a friend under “social plans” calendar, I don’t have to wade through all the calendars reminding me of my former career. However, I don’t want to delete them, and lose all the entries over the last 15 years, either. 

Is there a way to archive a calendar and then hide it from available options? 

I tried a workaround that didn’t pan out: I renamed each of the relevant calendars so that their name starts with “RETIRED” (“RETIRED Seminars”, for example). I then toggled them off from the sidebar, and the visual calendar grid is indeed much cleaner. However, if I make a new calendar entry for coffee with a friend, I still have to scroll through various RETIRED calendars. They also don’t group up by alphabetical order. 

Any tips here? I want to retain access to those many years of entries, as they remain relevant, but I also want to have the emotional distance I need while I come to terms with leaving that career path (there are some complex emotions at stake).

1hhsqwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/proselytizing/comments/1hhsqwc/daath_lichabatstseleth_a_religion_for_the/, Da'ath liChabatstseleth - a religion for the American Queer,"When Yaldaboath had finished destroying Sodom and Gomorrah, because they did not obey that law he decreed, there was a survivor from Sodom. This Sodomite was called Bōqerqar, because he was the cooling morning after the fiery destruction of his city. 
Now Bōqerqar was a very beautiful man, His skin was dark as coffee, and soft as the petals of the rose, and so he was called the Rose of Sodom.
Now Bōqerqar was also a very wise man, and when Yaldaboath destroyed the city he escaped with his family, and hid among the people of Canaan. 
Now Bōqerqar, the wise, had known, that the true God had not established a law - that the law of Yaldaboath was false, and the only true law was that of three things - the Gnosis that there is God's essence in all, and that the true God is completely perfect and had created no flaw, contrary to the god of the imperfect world, and that perfect love between all is the result of this Gnosis, and that there is no unlawfulness in any expression of perfect love. 
Now Bōqerqar had taught this, in the cities of the Canaanites he taught Gnosis and Libertine teachings, that of not needing to Obey any law, but rather to pursue the Gnosis of the God beyond the imperfect world, and so this was one of the reasons why Yaldaboath declared war on the people of Canaan, because they had attained Gnosis, but when they were killed they had already ascended to another form beyond their bodies - and so though their bodies were cast into Sheol, their mind and spirit were immortal - and there was no death. 
And so his wisdom is called Da'ath liChabatstseleth, because they are the teachings of the Rose of Sodom. 

While this religion is based on the spiritual needs of the American Queer people, all are welcome to heed the Da'ath liChabatstseleth. It can be syncretized with any religion, so long as the tenants of God being perfect and beyond the flawed world, with His essence of good being present in all, Perfect Love being the natural result of this Knowledge, and God did not establish a permanent binding law.

It's been a full year now and that's the deadline I've set for myself to admit that it is a DB and something needs to be done about it while our relationship can still be saved.

As the title says I started to experiment with solo dating. I've been on three dates so far and tonight is my fourth. I try to go on at least one date per month for an hour or two.

My therapist suggested this activity and since it seems to be working, I felt the need to share it with the group. Maybe it can help others.

If you have done this before or planning to do this to improve on your DB situation, I am also looking for advice here. It could be more targeted date suggestions or some of the things you've learned along the way. Is this something that worked for you long term? Do you think this could help with the DB at all?

My current goals are: 

*To improve on my self esteem which suffers because of the DB.

*To understand myself better and why I am in a dead bedroom. Is it my behavior or circumstances that triggered it or enable it somehow? What's within my control?

*To treat myself to things that don't necessarily have to do with partner intimacy and escape for a bit from all the craziness at home.


Progress: 
I've been on a coffee date, to the cinema and out for a fancy dinner so far. I always doll myself up for the dates and it makes me feel so much better.


Lessons learned:

*If you go to dinner by yourself, people will likely think someone stood you up.

*My husband finds the activities that I enjoy to be rather boring.

*My husband still finds me attractive and gets jelous when I go out looking like I do.

*I think I might have pretty privilege. It's amazing what people would do for me and honestly, I am so used to this behavior that I needed to focus on observing just what others do around me for an hour to notice certain gestures.

*I don't need my husband's validation as much as I thought I did.

*Many people are perfectly fine with cheating and even encourage it. That one was a toughie. I will not cheat and even find it funny when someone tries to convince me it's worth it. 

*It's fun to have a secret!

**#1. Coffee cake with prunes and peanuts**

Chocolate, coffee, prunes, cinnamon and nuts perfectly blend together, creating a deep and noble composition of taste and aroma. Today we will prepare an incomparable pie with the addition of all these ingredients. The cake turns out to be loose and crumbly, although it is prepared without eggs and dairy products. A great baking option for sweet lovers!

 **Ingredients for 4 servings:**

Wheat flour 5.29 oz

Water 1/2 cup

Instant coffee 1/2 tablespoon

Cocoa powder 2 teaspoons

Olive oil 2 tablespoons

Sugar 2 tablespoons

Baking powder 1 teaspoon

Pitted prunes 3 tablespoons

Peanuts 2 tablespoons

Ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon

Vanilla to taste

Salt to taste

**Instruction:**

Cooking time one hour

Prepare the necessary ingredients.

I used roasted peanuts. If the nuts are raw, pre-fry them in a dry frying pan or in the microwave and cool. I used dried prunes, the taste of the cake will be bright.

Such a pie is prepared quickly enough, so it is best to turn on the oven in advance to warm up to a temperature of 356F.

Pour instant coffee and sugar into a cup and pour boiling water over it. Stir and leave to cool to room temperature. Pour the cooled coffee into a bowl.

Add salt, vanilla, ground cinnamon and vegetable oil to the coffee. Mix well. In another bowl, combine the dry ingredients: flour, baking powder and cocoa.

Sift the mixture of dry ingredients through a fine sieve. Combine the powdery mixture with the coffee. Knead the smooth chocolate dough without lumps. Peel the peanuts.

Pour the nuts on a board, cover them with a bag and chop them into small crumbs with a rolling pin. Cut the prunes into small cubes. Put the nuts (leave a little to sprinkle on the cake) and the prunes in the chocolate dough. Mix the additives into the dough using a silicone spatula.

Cover the bottom of the baking dish with parchment and transfer the dough to it. Sprinkle the remaining nuts on the surface of the cake. Bake the chocolate cake in the oven, preheated to 356F, for about 35 minutes. Remove the finished cake from the mold and cool. Chocolate and coffee cake with prunes and nuts is ready. Bon Appetit!

**#2. Omelet with greens and walnuts**

A delicious dish of various fragrant herbs, walnuts and eggs. Simple, flavorful and very satisfying.

**Ingredients for 4 servings:**  
Eggs 5 pcs.  
Fresh parsley 2 tablespoons  
Fresh dill 1 tablespoon  
Fresh mint 1 tablespoon  
Green onion 2 tablespoons  
Walnuts (kernels) 3 tablespoons  
Fresh coriander 1 tablespoon  
Fresh basil 1 tablespoon  
Flour 2 tablespoons  
Salt to taste  
Olive oil for frying

**Instruction:**

Cooking time 25 minutes

We will need different greens that need to be peeled from the stems. A set of greens can be any to your taste.  
In a large bowl, finely chop the parsley, dill, green onion, coriander, mint and basil. Mix the greens, add a little salt and knead it with your hands so that it gives juice.

Walnuts are sorted and chopped in a blender or with a knife. You can cut it into small pieces, or you can almost make it into flour-as you want. Add nuts to the greens. We also add flour to it. Mix everything together.

In another bowl, break 5 eggs. Each new egg is added to the rest through a separate bowl. Beat the eggs a little with a fork.

Pour the greens with the egg mixture and mix well. In a frying pan, heat the vegetable oil, pour the prepared mixture there, distribute it over the pan, cover with a lid. And cook the omelet with herbs and walnuts over medium heat until the bottom side is browned and the top side is hard.

After that, cut the omelet with a spatula into 4 parts and turn each quarter.  
We bring the second side to the same ruddiness as the first. Bon Appetit!

**#3.Date bars with walnuts, coconut chips and spices**

Date bars with walnuts, coconut shavings and spices are a healthy and delicious snack. Which adults and children will enjoy with pleasure. The bars are prepared without adding sugar. Thanks to dates, they are sweet, nutritious and fragrant.

**Ingredients for 6 servings:**  
Dates (pitted weight)  
Walnuts 3.53 oz  
Coconut chips 2 tablespoons  
Cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon  
Fresh ginger 1 teaspoon  
Cardamom 2 boxes

**Instruction:**

Cooking time two hours and 20 minutes

Prepare all the ingredients. Wash and dry the dates in advance. Choose spices according to your taste. Fresh ginger can be replaced with dried ginger. Pour the walnuts into the bowl of a blender. Grind to a fine crumble.

Peel the ginger. Grate on a fine grater. Add coconut chips, ground cinnamon, ginger, and cardamom to the nuts. Remove the seeds from the dates. Add the dates to the rest of the ingredients.

Grind the contents of the bowl until smooth. The mass turns out to be dense and slightly sticks to the hands. If the mixture is very sticky, add some more coconut shavings or nuts.

For the molding, I used a rectangular shape . I covered it with parchment.  
Put the nut mass into the mold and tamp it well. You can simply put it on parchment and form a rectangle.

Send it to the refrigerator for 2 hours, so that the mass becomes more dense. After a while, cut the cooled and compacted layer into bars of the desired size. Date bars with walnuts, coconut chips and spices are ready. Serve to a sweet table.

Bars are convenient to take with you on the road, to work and to give to children to school. Enjoy your tea! Bon Appetit!

1hhsfxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1hhsfxo/i_miss_bangalore/,I miss Bangalore,"I'm from Delhi. By ""I'm from Delhi"" I mean I'm actually from here and so is my family since '48. I've been to Bangalore a couple of times for short durations (longest was 3 months at a stretch). I returned from Bangalore to Delhi in October and let me say, I'm prepared to physically fight anyone who disagrees that quality of life is far better in Bangalore than in Delhi. You can call me an ""Honorary Kannadiga"" that way. 

Let's get certain things out of the way first. Traffic. Yes, it can be bad. But it's there in Delhi too. Try being on the road to Gurgaon or near ITO. I'd still rather be in traffic in Bangalore than Delhi. Next is water. Ha! There are places in Delhi where you don't get water either so let's not kid ourselves that Bangalore is unique in that way. What next? Rude autowallahs? You have to be kidding me. Autowallahs look way more civilized and polite in Bangalore than Delhi where every person you meet has this wild look. I've been comuting multiple times daily by auto for three months and never had a problem with anyone telling me to speak in Kannada so I suspect this is highly blown out of proportion. Besides, I don't see anything wrong with learning a few words and phrases if you're living there long term. I've seen plenty of fellow North Indians IRL (including my family) and on social media be very insensitive/rude and not appreciative of Bangalore and Karnataka in general. The kind who cannot look beyond ""Chhole Bhature"" and think South Indian food is only idly dosa. 

This leads me to the positives. FOOD. Insane. Especially if you're a non-vegetarian. Where do I even begin? It's also MUCH more affordable and I include restaurant food. That itself should end the debate. But no, let's move forward. We've all heard of the famed Bangalore weather. If you take it for granted, try living in Delhi where temperatures are extreme and you're either burning or freezing (the latter is worse as there's no indoor heating in homes). This year pollution (smog) was the worst it has ever been in memory. Something as basic as a blue sky is science fiction here and you notice that when you see a thick layer of smog as you descend on the city by plane. Even my fellow co-passengers were chuckling how bad it is. 

Bangalore is blessed with great geography. You have Mangalore and the coast on one side. You can even take a road trip to Goa. You have Coorg and the hills. You have Northern Karnataka. You have Mysore. You have Kerala down south and Tamil Nadu to the east. Plenty of places to visit unlike Delhi where you are surrounded by literal wastelands like Punjab and Haryana and UP. There's also much more diversity in Bangalore I feel than in Delhi. Drinking culture (bars, coffee houses, etc.) are great and they're cheaper somehow (though not if you buy directly from store MRP wise). People are nicer. More job opportunities. I also like the old school British influence with the churches.

Ultimately, I suspect all the hate for Bangalore comes from techies who don't like their jobs and narrow minded persons. ",111,1734613438.0,bangalore,23,0.87,False

I fill up the brita and pour that into a giant 2(?)gallon glass jug that gets stored in the fridge to have fridge cold water. Between the dog, cats, water on the go and water while at home, we run through this glass pitcher quite fast.

 It also takes up a lot of space in the apartment fridge.

1hhs9nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1hhs9nl/missing_certification_lufthansas_expensive/,"""Missing certification: Lufthansa's expensive problems with the seats"" (Der Spiegel)","(Translation by me)

>*Lufthansa is waiting for brand-new jets from the USA. But certification for the new seats is missing, the planes stay grounded. Additionally, the group's CEO Spohr questions the reintroduction of free coffee on short-haul routes.*  
  
The cabin configuration on Lufthansa planes is presumed as dated, in bad shape and quality-wise far behind the competition. Passengers are unhappy, and for a long time resentment is spreading among the staff. The new cabin named »Allegris«, which has been built into a small number of planes already, is supposed to change that.

>But the seats are troubled on a significant number of planes. That's how 13 ready-made planes of the type Boeing 787 are currently parked at the Boeing plant in the US city Charleston - soon it'll be 15, said Lufthansa's boss Carsten Spohr at an internal meeting on Wednesday afternoon. The new seats were built into 6 aircraft already. The problem: the US safety body FAA currently denies certification for the seats manufactured by US vendor Collins Aerospace. Without it, the planes can't be delivered.

>The reason for this is a crash test where the seats are being stressed up to the 16-fold of earths gravitational force. These tests are important to make sure that the seats can hold the passengers in case of an accident and not fail.

>**Vacant seats in Business Class?**

>When certification will be done is in limbo. Nobody in the group seriously thinks it will happen before the summer of 2025. They don't even exclude a scenario where the seats don't get certified at all. Spohr's managers are now considering getting a number of aircraft to Frankfurt, anyway. The not certified seats would then remain vacant; they're part of Business Class - Economy Class as well as Premium Economy could be used completely. Not all »Allegris« seats were manufactured by Collins, those already at service are not subject to the certification problems.  
  
**Lead weights in the Airbus**  
  
In fact, Lufthansa receives compensation for the problems, but supposedly they can't compensate for what might have been earned with the new aircraft, Spohr says. »Allegris« offers less Business Class seats than existing Lufthansa long-range aircraft, however they are hoping to charge higher prices for the better product. The most profit Lufthansa makes doesn't stem from Business Class, anyway, but from the intermediate class Premium Economy. This will be expanded in the medium and long term, says Spohr.

>Elsewhere, the new seat sparks trouble for the group. At Lufthansa's subsidy Swiss the Airbus A330 even needs to be equipped with lead weights - otherwise, the new cabin outfit »Swiss Senses« would run the jet out of trim, which means the center of gravity would shift.

>**The seats issue on mid-range flights**

>Lufthansa Group passengers flying far routes on mid-range jets like the Airbus A320 will still not enjoy comfortable seats. Among those are routes to Dubai or Cairo. They may possibly test on a few aircraft whether a new cabin outfit could be profitable on these routes, says Spohr. A more comfortable seat in Business Class might be conceivable. Currently, on those aircraft there's only one type of seat through the whole cabin. That's not different in Business Class, too, which primarily sparks confusion among travellers from the USA. The problem: if they rearranged the cabin, at least two rows of seats would drop out. The Italian airline ITA, which Lufthansa just starts holding stakes in, even offers a three-category configuration on their Airbus A321neo. That's supposed to stay this way, Spohr said.

>**No free coffee?**

>Another topic could be buried again soon. Mid-year, Lufthansa announced testing pouring free coffee and tea again. In the internal meeting Spohr left open whether this will become a standard again. Throughout the group they alledgedly earned just 7 Euros per passenger. Even one Euro extra cost per passenger would be one seventh of profit. It's less about the cost for the coffee than the fact that bord services would generate less sales that way. One should ask themselves whether and to what extent they could afford that.

1hhs8al,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderDronesOfficial/comments/1hhs8al/parabellum_chapter_ii_continuation/,"Parabellum, Chapter II Continuation","Uzi stared at herself in the mirror, shakily brushing away some strands of dull purple that had fallen into her face. *Christ, I look like hell.* There were visible bags under her dimmed neon purple optics, her hair was frizzy and in dire need of brushing from having a hood draped over it for so long—and her arms trembled slightly. Her striped sweater had traces of dried blood along the sleeve even though she was sure her overcoat had covered everything. The corpse she had left behind—unceremoniously shoved in a stolen Mercedes sedan trunk—flashed non-stop in her mind like a cassette on repeat. The very moment she had walked into her apartment, she threw off her overcoat that had her pistol safely stashed away as if someone had slipped molten iron inside, leaving it on the cold floor. The high-rise apartment complex itself was a physical asset owned by Don Rossi’s real estate firm, but just behind the curtain was an intricate money laundering scheme that had gone on for years without a hitch, one that Uzi herself took active part in—it certainly cut college debt from the paper stacks of worry that weighed her mind down like lead, and it rarely involved bloodshed. With the amount of money she had gotten from the laundering, Uzi had bought her own car—a pristine darkish-silver Audi that sat comfortably in the bowels of the complex garage—a special place within the garage reserved only for the made members of the Rossi crime syndicate. The car earned a few jealous stares from most of her classmates, but it was nothing that would raise serious suspicions, Uzi made sure of that. If there was anything Rossi had raised her to be, it was to be cautious. There would be no way for law enforcement to trace it back to the family if push came to shove—no insurance, no fingerprint or retina lock, she used old-fashioned keys instead. There would be no foundation they could build off of.  
   For three years, millions upon millions of dollars flowed into the pockets of the *consigliori*, or advisor, the mafia proper, and the Don himself. Being a made member of the mob, Uzi was given “special treatment” by the firm—essentially free living, something the teen certainly wasn't complaining about, especially at a time like this. The police no doubt had recovered the remains of Oliver Mackenzie—the only abhorrent piece of evidence she had left behind—but Uzi couldn't bring herself to turn on the TV. When she reached for the remote—or tried to—her arm would not move even slightly. Those shot-out eyes seared themselves into her thoughts, and the nineteen-year-old drone’s synthetic stomach lurched with every shaky breath she drew. She had done it so carelessly, so *effortlessly* just an hour ago—left the body in the stolen sedan and made off like she had just departed a taxi—and now here she was, shaking like a leaf in autumn. Her hands trembled with a relentless force even as she gripped the porcelain sink, her legs as weak as an old lady's. Her heart pounded against her chest with all of the force of an automatic rifle—halfly from adrenaline, and half from the constant feeling of being watched.

Uzi knew that she was the only one in her small apartment, but even looking away from the bathroom mirror made all of the hairs on her body stand on end. She squeezed her optics shut and ground her teeth—trying, trying to wrest away those reddish black holes where two sea-blue orbs once laid—yet it clung to her like a leech that refused to let go of its host. Her gaze once again floated back to the mirror, and her optics hollowed in fear and resentment. She so badly wanted to punch the mirror with all of the strength she still had in her trembling arms—to scream at it to stop displaying her—but her grip only tightened on the gleaming white bathroom sink, as if some intangible entity had nailed her hands to the porcelain without her knowledge. She had stopped feeling the cold tiles long ago, only wishing for it to open up and swallow her whole; she wouldn't object to it. Sure, she had killed before—but never like this. It had always been a single shot. A clean—scarily accurate hit that would ensure minimal suffering—if at all. Why was this so different? Why was it so—so brutal? Uzi could barely reconcile herself with the woman that had committed such an obscene, animalistic act merely an hour or two ago. Her frame began to shake again—this time much more violently than before, and the teenage drone felt like an airtight bag had been yanked over her head and zipped tight. Uzi’s arms flew to her head, her hands grabbing tufts of her dull purple locks—yanking it as hard as she could, as she was a mountain climber hanging onto a rope for dear life after slipping. The guttural scream that should've ripped through her throat was instead blocked up, creating a burning sensation akin to that of taking a swig of whiskey—but the burn didn't last for a fleeting second. She once again squeezed her optics shut, stumbling out of the bathroom—but even in the darkness, all she could see were those eyes—as blue as the Pacific Ocean—widening for the final time as they stared down the very last thing they'd ever see—a suppressor. A jolt of pain made Uzi's optics snap open as the back of her foot made contact with the drawers under her bed—causing the teen to fall back and onto the mattress.

   But even the embrace of the soft, plush material did little to calm the storm raging in her. Tears began to flow down, the sheer number of which akin to the constant downpour just outside. She curled into herself, bringing her knees up to her chest—the cold Seattle wind that always happened to be infused with the earthy smell of rain flowing over her, softly whistling—mocking her pitiful state. Sobs wracked her body, but even then the memories were ceaseless. The rain began to get louder, along with the constant thrum of her heart in her auditory receptors. Every rustle of the blanket was amplified tenfold—but the constant hammering of the rain overpowered all but the rapid fire of her heart. At the blare of a far-away ferry horn that sounded like it had barked right in front of her, she shot up in a cold sweat, like she had been hit full-blast with a water shotgun after sleeping in the scorching desert sands of the Sahara for months—tears still rolling down her visor and burning her optics like the relentless African sun. Uzi wanted to scream—she wanted to dig her nails into her casing and tear it off, piece by agonizing piece—to curl up into the fetal position and… She wasn't sure what else. With every move, she couldn't stop shaking—every inch forward carrying the crushing weight of what she had just done. It was so unlike her to do something so cruel. She never made anyone suffer unnecessarily—and yet, she just did. She created fear, and she reveled in it. Why? The question rained down on her unraveling mind like a jury casting accusations, and yet the answer itself eluded her. But what disgusted—repulsed Uzi the most is that she **enjoyed** it.

The feeling of control, it was like lightning upon a live wire. It made her feel alive in the most sickening way. Maybe she just wanted to get it over with. Maybe she was mad. Mad at something, anything. The rain still ceaselessly pitter-pattered outside, and Uzi shakily turned her head to the open window to her right, where the cold air danced from the outside world to the inside of Uzi's apartment. She gazed out to the city with hollowed, red-rimmed and haunted optics—and was met with the usual blinding neon lights that seemed to infect every inch of the city, the bark of car horns in the distance, sprawling skyscrapers that seemed to reach the heavens and reduce the labyrinth on ground level to mere ants, along with the acrid smell of car exhaust mixing with the earthy aroma of the rain, algae, and ocean water from the close-by Lake Washington. Along with that concoction of smell, the bittersweet scent of coffee that seemed to cover the whole city at times wafted into the apartment, a more than welcome undertone. To the left of her was a campus that always looked like it had just been snatched right out of time itself—the sprawling labyrinth of the University of Washington, where she was currently studying, evergreen trees clustered around the hundreds of buildings that made up the campus and surrounding areas like a maze made of nature itself. From the ground level, they were towering spires—yet gazing down from the heavens, they appeared like saplings.     

 Further beyond that was the now-quiet Husky Stadiums, covered in dark fallen leaves, blown in by the chilly November wind and most definitely soaked with rainwater. Even after all of these centuries—in 3071—it still hadn't changed a bit. The architecture of its many units and departments still retained its Victorian-era exterior; only enlarged and fitted with a renovated interior to fit present needs, but it still held that grand old man mystique amidst the neon lights and 4D billboards of the city. It always teemed with activity—always at least one or two lights on throughout the night. The windowsill was slick with rainwater, small puddles gleaming in the moonlight—reflecting the overcast Seattle skyline. The upper part of the window was blurred by the trillions of droplets landing on it every couple seconds, leaving it a distorted mess of outlines and piercing city lights—so bright, yet so dim and out of reach.

 

Occasionally, a raindrop would slip in and land with a soft *plip*, making the drone jolt slightly. All the same, the scenery served to comfort her. The rolling gray clouds above that seemed to pour out tiny droplets of water non-stop were oddly relaxing—as if it was sucking up all of Uzi's darkest urges and carrying it far away, but dropping tiny, microscopic fragments of them along the way as cruel reminders of what she had just done. For a moment, she finally got rid of those eyes, those thin ribbons of veins that laid exposed along with the gushing crimson that seemed to never stop after she pulled the trigger. For a moment, she finally felt free after what seemed like a lifetime’s worth of torment. If only that really were the case. The opening chords of the instrumental version of *Everlong* plucked her back into reality, and nearly made her jump out of her own casing. With it, a large transparent neon-purple-outlined rectangle obstructed her vision.

  **INCOMING VOICE CALL.** There was no name—or no name Uzi could see, as she was currently tunnel visioning on the purple-colored words that were quite literally in her face. She let the call ring for a moment, absentmindedly swaying her head back and forth to the distorted riffs and drums that hammered its way into her skull, her knees once more drawn to her chest as she relentlessly fought to push away the imagery that made her heart drop into her synthetic stomach. *Drip*. Uzi was once again plucked from her music-induced trance by the sound of a raindrop, and she scrambled to answer the call before it faded from her sight. There was no encryption software Uzi had implemented—after all, who would think such a seemingly average, introverted, awkward college student would be a mobster for one of the most influential crime families in not only Seattle, but in all of the fifty states? But now, that was most certainly a possibility in her eyes. She cleared her throat, and shakily answered the call. Had she slipped up somehow? Had they finally caught up to her? But she had done everything right, and used her *MASK* software, perfectly evading law enforcement without a single… *Major* hitch. Surely they wouldn’t know—right? *Please don’t let it be who I think it is…*  
There was a silence that seemed to stretch on and on for millennia, even though Uzi was sure it was only for a couple seconds. Questions raced through her mind at an impossible speed. Should she speak up? She held her tongue, nervously flicking her sweater zipper.

   “Hey, ‘zi!” She was greeted with a chipper voice that broke through the tension and made her heart skip two beats, and Uzi exhaled a relieved breath she didn't even know she was holding in. She stuttered and tripped over her words, trying to formulate a coherent response and failing miserably each time. Her dark purple laptop lay on the foot of the bed—half-opened—but the display was completely black. Most likely dead. Uzi inwardly facepalmed. Before she left, she had forgotten to charge it—and she had a couple papers due. *Shit, shit, shit*. “Uzi, ya there?” She was once again taken out of her thoughts. “Y-yeah.” She managed to splutter out. Her gaze fixed on her laptop as yet another wave of worry came at her with the force of a square wave. The youthful voice on the other end was Gryffin, her childhood friend—and longtime crush.

  He was also Viktoria's brother.

  “You sound… off. You alright?” His voice took on a softer, more warm tone. He was known for being one of the nicest guys on campus—far too nice for this world. He never got into fights—and rarely raised his voice at all. Most of all he was blissfully oblivious to his sister's actual life, in spite of her more-than-well-off lifestyle. Uzi herself was completely out of the question—due to her seemingly unremarkable life, certainly not befitting of a mobster. Not that Gryffin hadn't gotten suspicious about the couple hundred dollars thrown at him whenever he was in need—but Viktoria was an expert liar, and the one Uzi had picked up her own silver tongue from. She always had some believable story to weave seemingly from thin air, and Uzi admired her for that.

   But even the best liars slip up.

   “I'm fine. Just… Tired.” She replied, after yet another bout of stuttering. Her heart fluttered when she heard him lightly chuckle in response, in spite of it currently beating faster than a Chiron on a good day. He always managed to find humor in everything—everything he reasonably could.  
  “I thought I'd never see the day you'd run out of energy. Guess the non-stop work’s finally caught up, huh, *Miss Workaholic*?” Uzi willed Gryffin to get to the point—her visor flushing in spite of the mental whirlpool she was currently fighting off. She tugged at her sweater, trying not to look at the small smear of crusted dried blood that streaked across the black and white stripes. “You left so suddenly. Did something happen?” Uzi's oil ran cold in her veins. Instead of an airtight alibi that was stitched together in mere microseconds—Uzi’s only response was silence.

   She had taken off while they were working on a humanities assignment with their other friends that couldn’t have picked a worse time to be assigned. In hindsight, Uzi was lucky that she had gotten that text when she did—she would've ended up saying something she'd probably deeply regret if she had been there a second longer. Against her better judgment, she eyed the small dried bloodstain that she could never escape seeing, trying to swim against the ever-growing, ever-present current of fear that kept the words—the silk to which the web was spun—stuck in her throat. The whistling wind beat against the glass of the window, pelting fat raindrops farther into the apartment, as if to try to shake her out of her woolgathering. Uzi silently wished—prayed—that this ever-turning world would slow its pace, if only for a second. While it spun, and spun, and spun without cease—she was miles behind—trying to hastily pick up the pieces and join it, only to do it all again.

   But time—the cruel mistress—would not heed her plea. Her optics began to drift once more, and she found herself aimlessly staring into space. Perhaps Uzi wasn't the same person—perhaps she had been transferred to another body, forced to watch whoever she now inhabited kill a man for simply doing his job in the most inhumane way. Maybe she'd wake up to the cold bristle of the wind, the constant chill of the now-moistened cardboard box she had curled herself into dampening her clothing and seeping into her casing—and the constant pang of hunger in the pit of her stomach. Maybe she'd be seven again—roaming the alleyways of Wallingford in soaked, torn rags that barely kept her warm. Her optic slightly glitched at the memories, and she winced. Did she really want to go back to that life?

   “Er… Yeah, something like that,” She managed to mumble, her trembling fingers threading through her dull purple hair. It still stung—having to lie to him non-stop like this, even if it was a half-lie. Every word that fell from Uzi’s tongue felt as heavy as an anvil and as acrid as cyanide, and she felt a constant ping in her stomach that spread up her back in a matter of seconds. But at the same time, the teenage drone couldn’t bring herself to even think about what would happen if she told him the actual truth. Her optics flitted between the overcoat that she had hastily discarded near her apartment door, and the blurred window. The grip of her suppressed *M9* peeked out of the inner pocket, the outer steel gleaming in the pale autumn moonlight while the leather, in contrast, only offered a dull shine. Everywhere she turned, she was reminded of what she had just done, as if some vengeful spirit of days past decided to go out of its way to make her life more of a living Hell than it already was. Her mouth twitched at the sight, her optics hollowing—and the words once again entangled themselves within her voice box. The follow-up was there, yes, but it felt too flimsy. “I—” She stopped herself, and once again began to fidget with her sweater sleeve. *Keep it together. Keep it together,* She told herself, swallowing hard. She had lost track of how many times she had repeated it to herself already, as if it was the only source of comfort in a world that wouldn't stop taking from someone that already had no more to give.

She wished, pleaded that the words would finally come out—that she'd be rid of this deafening silence that made her auditory receptors ring as if she had just stepped out of a metal concert—but the words remained stuck to her synthetic vocal chords. “Uzi, talk to me. Something's wrong. You're normally not this quiet. Did something happen?” The already stuck-up words had now forced themselves into her voice box and out of her memory. “I can hear your breathing. Are you hurt?” Her breath caught in her synthetic windpipe. She held her breath as if she was a diver that had gone too deep in the Mariana, her hollowed optics darting around as if she was looking for some unseen threat. Panic seized her before she could even properly process what was going on, and she froze—not daring to even utter a word. Then the words came out faster than she could catch them.  “N-no, of course not,” She spluttered, her words laced with anxiety instead of the usual monotone angst, something she tried her damn hardest to cover up. The words themselves spilled out like word-vomit, but he somehow caught each one. “I'm just a bit paranoid about a couple other projects I have due.” She nervously laughed in spite of the pang of guilt that spread throughout her skull like pain, and subsequently mentally berated herself for telling the single-most unconvincing lie she had ever told in her nineteen years of existence. *That could've gone so much better. Goddamn it, Uzi! Get a grip! You can do better than this!*

 

She mentally shook herself, a vain attempt to gather her scattered thoughts, which were like files that fell from an overturned cabinet. She was supposed to be mysterious, unflappable—yet here she was, falling apart at the seams just by the sound of her crush's infectious voice. She was probably just being delusional, there was no way in Hell he'd be into someone like her. Maybe she needed to get more sleep. Uzi once again mentally slapped herself with such force she felt the sting of the hit. It was a pathetic thought to think Gryffin would hold an iota of romantic interest in her, yet that fuzzy, almost calming warmth that came with hearing his voice would not fade, as much as she tried to suffocate it—much to the drone's dismay. Instead, it began to spread throughout her body—sending shiver after shiver down her spine. “I- I also had to run a couple errands. It was getting late either way, so…” She once again trailed off, the words leaving her mind. Yet another semi-fabrication. It was true, she had to run due to it getting late, and because he lived in *Kurotaka-kai* territory. Just weeks earlier, Jade had gotten into a bare-knuckle fight with a *kyodai* during an arms deal gone horribly wrong and ended up beating the bastard into a pulp, so anyone polishing Rossi's boots with their saliva wasn't exactly welcomed with open arms there. It was also true that she was pinged to run an “errand” that ended in one brutal death that would more than likely end up on the Seattle Sentinel front page for the week. Wait a minute… *Eureka*.

   “And after I saw the news; it…,” She audibly, yet shakily exhaled for extra emphasis. ""I read it at nine, made me sick."" The guilt in the pit of her stomach subsequently transformed into nausea at her actions, and bile crawled up her throat from what she had just done. She had just added a gallon of gasoline to an already raging fire she could barely contain, much less put out. Uzi’s head slowly sank into her hands, tears brimming and stinging her optics—but not yet falling down, staying in its place like a branding iron being pressed against skin. She shook her head against her palms, forcing down the rising bile and steeling herself, just as she had done many times before. She heard Gryffin hiss on the other end. “Yeah, it creeped me out too. Can't believe someone would do that.” Uzi recoiled as if she had been punched directly in the gut, her breath hitching as she began to once more fiercely fight against the incoming wave of scarlet and exposed vein that seared itself into her memory as the call settled into an awkward silence. If only he knew that she was the monster that had been behind something so vile, so inhumane, and yet here she was—hiding behind half-truths like a coward. Her hands clutched at her head, trembling like brittle leaves in a thunderstorm. She wanted to scream—scream until her vocal chords gave out, plead to whatever deity that wouldn’t let her rest to forgive her and make it stop until it would finally be cleared from her mind. It only worsened as she squeezed her optics shut, only becoming increasingly more vivid—more detailed. It was Jade's fault for getting Oliver so close, why’d she have to be the one to do it?

Why had Uzi agreed to track him down? But it wasn't like she had anything better to do at the moment, and if memory served, Jade’s hands were tied at that moment fighting off a hack—courtesy of the *Kurotaka-kai* for beating one of theirs to an oily pulp. Either way, Uzi was aching to escape the endless flood of academia, textbooks, and never-ending studying. But this was so not how she wanted to end her night. *Stupid, stupid, stupid!* Her fists clenched, grabbing tufts of her unkempt dull purple locks, and she began to pull—a dull burning sensation crawling throughout her scalp with each tug. Her racing mind returned to the saint that she waved back and forth just close to three years ago, her oil bubbling within the crackling orangish-blue flame that looked like the sky when the sun’s first rays peeked out of the darkness of the night as she took the oath that solidified her as judge, jury, and executioner. Except this was anything but that. She was in a lifelong debt to her father; to Aurelio Rossi, for saving her life when the federal government wouldn’t, and this was how she’d repay the favor. *This was necessary, wasn’t it? I had to do this.* “I need to get some sleep. Talk to you tomorrow?” She muttered, trying to keep her voice steady. Uzi knew there was no way she’d be getting even a millisecond of sleep even if she chanted that mantra to herself a thousand times over, but she needed something—anything to break the long silence that made her already scattered thoughts become more and more outlandish. “Yeah, that’s fine. Just wanted to check up on you. See you tomorrow, ‘zi. Be safe.” He said, his voice tinged with comfort that reeked of pity.

  Before the teen could reply, the line cut, and there was silence.

  Uzi tossed and turned in her bed as minutes stretched into what seemed like whole centuries, her optics wide open and hollowed out—the thick blanket draped over her frame not doing nearly enough to keep her warm as she began to quiver and shake, pixelated sweat pouring down her visor as the teen let out a barely audible whimper. The memories once again pounced upon her like a beast from the shadows, who patiently waited for its prey to come out of hiding and stumble into its hunting grounds. Now it was just the encroaching darkness, the pale half-moon that hung high above the overcast Seattle sky, the whistling wind that subtly blew strands of her hair to and fro, and the pelting rain to keep her company. Her gaze once again drifted to the discarded overcoat on the cold hardwood floor, right next to the plush silver fur carpet. The sweater she wore felt like it was pressing into her casing—suffocating her the more she looked at the overcoat, yet her optics would not move from it as her CPU raced between college life and the one that she kept close to her chest like a poker player would keep his cards.

   Uzi was really beginning to regret ending the call when she had.

# Policy Recommendations

* **Remove regulatory obstacles for domestic mining projects.** The United States should secure supply chains through the robust extraction of the critical minerals available domestically, first and foremost by removing regulatory barriers put up by the Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency.
* **Increase incentives for domestic mining projects.** Another series of studies by the Department of Defense is not going to fix the problem. The removal of federal regulations should be paired with incentives (or, where considered necessary, directives) for defense contractors to use domestically sourced supplies.
* **Invest in alternative supply chains.** The United States needs to actively seek mutually beneficial partnerships in the resource-rich Global South. Reshoring, nearshoring, and friendshoring should be undertaken with diversified global supply chains in friendly nations. National security interests will be doubly bolstered as the United States strengthens ties with the Global South through investment and trade while securing supply chains of critical defense minerals.

# Conclusion

***America should stop working against itself through extraneous, counterproductive regulatory measures. The United States should restore its position as a global producer of energy, furthering national security for America and its allies. America should reduce reliance on China and other foreign entities of concern in critical defense supply chains, as this reliance exposes the United States to considerable military vulnerabilities.***

Chinese dominance in critical defense minerals, exacerbated by the green energy transition championed by the Biden Administration, jeopardizes key defense supply chains. The United States should turn to domestic processing where possible and reshoring, nearshoring, and friendshoring where it is not. Investing in new partnerships will be essential for critical mineral security in a new era of U.S.–China competition. However, certain regulatory obstacles must be addressed before these strategies can be implemented.2025 Aerospace and Defense Industry Outlook

# 2025 Aerospace and Defense Industry Outlook

***The aerospace and defense industry is likely to see broad-based operationalization of an array of technologies***

[2025 Aerospace and Defense Industry Outlook | Deloitte Insights](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/aerospace-defense/aerospace-and-defense-industry-outlook.html)

In the past year, the aerospace and defense industry has confronted various challenges ranging from supply chain issues to talent and production shortages. However, Deloitte’s analysis indicates that the industry is experiencing growth and progressing in these areas. In the commercial sector, demand for air travel was high in 2024 and recovered completely from the COVID-19 pandemic dip.[^(1)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/aerospace-defense/aerospace-and-defense-industry-outlook.html#endnote-1) According to the International Air Transport Association, demand for global air passenger traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers, is expected to grow by 11.6% in 2024 compared with 2023.[^(2)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/aerospace-defense/aerospace-and-defense-industry-outlook.html#endnote-2) As of August 2024, global air passenger traffic was up 11.9% year-to-date, and total capacity, measured in available seat kilometers, increased 10.2% year-to-date.[^(3)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/aerospace-defense/aerospace-and-defense-industry-outlook.html#endnote-3)

In defense, geopolitical tensions continued, pushing countries to increase defense spending. Per the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, approximately 59 countries were at war in 2022, up by 27 countries compared to 2019.[^(4)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/aerospace-defense/aerospace-and-defense-industry-outlook.html#endnote-4) As a result, defense expenditures surpassed US$2.4 trillion in 2023 (most recent data at the time of publication).[^(5)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/aerospace-defense/aerospace-and-defense-industry-outlook.html#endnote-5)

These trends are expected to continue into 2025, with the potential for broad-based operationalization of many technologies, from artificial intelligence and advanced air mobility (AAM) to unmanned systems. Over the past year, AI has seemingly become ubiquitous, potentially indicating that companies in the sector are growing more and more comfortable with the technology. In 2025, AI is likely to help accelerate progress in various areas, including enhancing aftermarket services and optimizing supply chain.

The industry is also likely to experience continued, and possibly expedited, growth in hard technology in 2025. In the United States alone, the Biden administration has requested a budget of US$849.8 billion for the Department of Defense (DoD) for fiscal 2025.[^(6)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/aerospace-defense/aerospace-and-defense-industry-outlook.html#endnote-6) The budget priorities may act as a catalyst for further industry spending in unmanned systems and the space economy. Specifically, the commercial sector is likely to continue advancing toward AAM solutions. Finally, it is likely that, in 2025, aerospace and defense companies will prioritize resiliency and visibility in their supply chains to ensure the future of their technologies.

# APRIL 2024~ NIOBIUM/TITANIUM ~ Researchers uncover kinky metal alloy that won't crack at extreme temperatures at the atomic level

# [Researchers uncover kinky metal alloy that won't crack at extreme temperatures at the atomic level](https://phys.org/news/2024-04-uncover-kinky-metal-alloy-wont.html)

[DoD STOCKPILE DOES STAND OUT HERE LOL.... T.B.D....](https://preview.redd.it/da4hoah1ts7e1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b95ecd7425618a5b46445216f6b7c276cdd44fda)

A metal alloy composed of niobium, tantalum, titanium, and hafnium has shocked materials scientists with its impressive strength and toughness at both extremely hot and cold temperatures, a combination of properties that seemed so far to be nearly impossible to achieve.

In this context, strength is defined as how much force a material can withstand before it is permanently deformed from its original shape, and toughness is its resistance to fracturing (cracking). The alloy's resilience to bending and fracture across an enormous range of conditions could open the door for a novel class of materials for next-generation engines that can operate at higher efficiencies.

The team, led by Robert Ritchie at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley, in collaboration with the groups led by professors Diran Apelian at UC Irvine and Enrique Lavernia at Texas A&M University, discovered the alloy's surprising properties and then figured out how they arise from interactions in the atomic structure. Their work is described in a study that was [published](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn2428) in *Science*.

""The efficiency of converting heat to electricity or thrust is determined by the temperature at which fuel is burned—the hotter, the better. However, the [operating temperature](https://phys.org/tags/operating+temperature/) is limited by the structural materials which must withstand it,"" said first author David Cook, a Ph.D. student in Ritchie's lab. ""We have exhausted the ability to optimize further the materials we currently use at high temperatures, and there's a big need for novel metallic materials. That's what this alloy shows promise in.""

# The alloy in this study is from a new class of metals known as refractory high or medium entropy alloys (RHEAs/RMEAs). Most of the metals we see in commercial or industrial applications are alloys made of one main metal mixed with small quantities of other elements, but RHEAs and RMEAs are made by mixing near-equal quantities of metallic elements with very high melting temperatures, which gives them unique properties that scientists are still unraveling.

Ritchie's group has been investigating these alloys for several years because of their potential for high-temperature applications.

""Our team has done previous work on RHEAs and RMEAs, and we have found that these materials are very strong but generally possess extremely low fracture toughness, which is why we were shocked when this alloy displayed exceptionally high toughness,"" said co-corresponding author Punit Kumar, a postdoctoral researcher in the group.

According to Cook, most RMEAs have a fracture toughness of less than 10 MPa√m, which makes them some of the most brittle metals on record. The best cryogenic steels, specially engineered to resist fracture, are about 20 times tougher than these materials. Yet the niobium, tantalum, titanium, and hafnium (Nb45Ta25Ti15Hf15) RMEA alloy was able to beat even the cryogenic steel, clocking in at over 25 times tougher than typical RMEAs at room temperature.

***But engines don't operate at room temperature. The scientists evaluated strength and toughness at five temperatures total: -196°C (the temperature of liquid nitrogen), 25°C (room temperature), 800°C, 950°C, and 1200°C. The last temperature is about 1/5 the surface temperature of the sun.***

***The team found that the alloy had the highest strength in the cold and became slightly weaker as the temperature rose but still boasted impressive figures throughout the wide range. The fracture toughness, which is calculated from how much force it takes to propagate an existing crack in a material, was high at all temperatures.***

- I got stalked by a man in the Starfield library all the way to outside the mall.
- Got physically touched and dragged into stores in the namdaemun market and had workers putting items in my cart trying to force sales.
- Got lectured in a coffee store for ordering an hour before closing time and got served cold coffee.
- Had people change seats when I sat on the tube and had workers handing freebies pull them away when I walked past.
- Had corner store workers grab items from my hand and put it to the till before I am done shopping.
- Had restaurants turn me away for being a solo diner. I didn’t go to bbq or large dining places. 
- Got rejected by taxis on my way home from a night out. It got so bad I approached a police officer, translated that I need help finding a taxi as I am tipsy and lost and got shoo’d away with hand gestures.

When it comes to natural ways to boost energy, enhance vitality, and support overall health, few herbs stand out quite like maca root. Native to the Andes mountains of Peru, this superfood has been used for centuries for its incredible health benefits, especially for men. Whether you’re looking to improve physical performance, balance hormones, or simply boost your overall wellness, maca deserves your attention.

Here’s why maca is the ultimate herb for men and how it can transform your health:

1. Natural Energy and Stamina Booster

Modern life often leaves men feeling drained, juggling work, relationships, and physical fitness. Maca root, often referred to as “Peruvian ginseng,” is an adaptogen—meaning it helps your body adapt to stress while enhancing energy levels. Unlike caffeine, which gives you a quick spike and crash, maca provides a sustainable, jitter-free energy boost. It’s perfect for men looking to fuel long workouts or power through busy days.

2. Supports Hormonal Balance and Fertility

One of the standout benefits of maca is its ability to support hormone regulation. For men, this means improved testosterone production and fertility. Several studies have shown that maca can enhance sperm count and motility, making it a natural solution for men looking to improve their reproductive health. It’s also helpful in combating the effects of stress, which can negatively impact hormone levels.

3. Boosts Libido and Sexual Health

If there’s one reason maca has gained global recognition, it’s for its libido-enhancing effects. Often called “nature’s Viagra,” maca is well-known for increasing sexual desire and performance. Its ability to improve circulation and hormonal balance can lead to improved stamina and overall sexual health, making it a must-have herb for men seeking a natural solution to boost their confidence in the bedroom.

4. Enhances Physical Performance

For men who love hitting the gym, maca can be a game-changer. Its high nutrient profile—rich in vitamins, minerals, and amino acids—helps improve endurance, muscle recovery, and strength. Many athletes incorporate maca into their pre-workout routine to boost performance naturally without synthetic supplements.

5. Improves Mood and Mental Clarity

The benefits of maca extend beyond the physical. It’s also known to enhance mental well-being by reducing stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression. Maca’s adaptogenic properties help regulate cortisol levels (the stress hormone), which can lead to improved focus, better decision-making, and an overall sense of calm.

How to Use Maca

Maca is incredibly versatile and can easily be incorporated into your daily routine. It’s available in powder, capsule, or extract form. Here are some popular ways to use it:
	•	Morning Smoothies: Add a teaspoon of maca powder to your favorite smoothie for an energy-packed start to your day.
	•	Coffee Substitute: Mix maca with warm almond milk and a dash of cinnamon for a caffeine-free energy drink.
	•	Workout Boost: Blend maca into your protein shake before or after exercise.

When starting with maca, go slow—around 1 teaspoon (or 500mg if in capsule form) per day is enough to start noticing its effects. Over time, you can gradually increase the dosage.

Final Thoughts

Maca root is truly a superfood for men. From boosting energy and libido to improving mood and physical performance, this ancient herb checks all the boxes. The best part? It’s entirely natural and comes with minimal side effects when taken as recommended.

If you’re ready to take your health and vitality to the next level, give maca a try. Whether you’re looking to power through workouts, enhance your confidence, or just feel your best, this herb is the natural ally every man needs.

1hhrsup,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigsupportgroup/comments/1hhrsup/milking_the_cashcow/,Milking the CashCow,"The room was dark. The only light was from the laptop and phone screen in front of me. I was on my knees. Naked. Noise cancelling headphones on. The little shrimp between my legs pressing painfully against its flat cage. CashApp open and ready to send on my phone and a video of my mistress on the screen.

I took a deep breath. I admired the Mediterranean beauty of my mistress on the screen. Her perfect body wrapped in a shiny latex catsuit. After a few moments I pressed play.

""Welcome my little cash cow,"" her soft voice rang in my ears like honey. ""Are you ready to be milked?"" My eyes were glued to the screen. Her hands were playing with her gorgeous latex-covered breasts as she spoke. ""Today is going to be a nice and long milking my little cow."" She giggled.

""Open your cashapp and select to send to me."" She ordered. I could feel my shrimp pulsating in its prison. Trying to escape. A few drops were already leaking out. ""Good little cow. Now go ahead and enter 1."" I did as she commanded with trembling hands. ""And 5 and then send,"" as she said the word ""send"" she snapped her fingers. This sent a shiver down my spine and I hit the send button without even thinking.

""Good little cash cow. Did that make you leak some semen?"" She said with a smile. I looked down at my pink cage and saw some white oozing out. ""If you did, go on, scoop it up with your finger and lick it for your mistress."" I blushed a little but did as I was told. Scooping it up and licking it off my fingers. All the while listening to the sound of her playing with herself in that latex catsuit. The sound of her fingers rubbing against the rubber drove me mad.

""I think you're ready for some more don't you cow?"" Her hand is now rubbing over her latex covered crotch. ""Go ahead, type in 4 and then 5 and."" Snap. There was a brief silence in the video. My brain had been conditioned to send the signal again by pressing the button without me having to think.

""Did you send on hearing the snap like a good little cash cow?"" She asked. ""If you didn't, you'd better send an apology!"" She looked into the camera with a stern face. ""How did that bigger transmission make you feel, my little cow? I bet you want to empty that uterus of yours? But you know the rules! No coming without my permission!""

It was painful. The cage digging into me. Reminding me every second how much of a Beta I was. ""Let's get some quick sends going now, my little cow. Every time I snap my fingers, you go ahead and send me $5! Ready?"" I nodded, even though I was just watching a video.

Snap.

Snap.

Snap.

Snap.

Snap.

My body was mindlessly sending with every snap that echoed through my headphones. My eyes fixed on her fingers.

Snap.

Snap.

Snap.

Snap.

Snap.

My head is dizzy now. My shrimp begging to be released. ""Such a good cow. Polovian conditioning has really done wonders for you. I bet every time you hear a snap in public you get the urge to send.""

I feel trapped. How did she know? 

She giggled as her hands slid over her body. ""Are you ready for the bug finale?"" She asked. I could feel every fibre of my being begging for release. Hoping to hear divine words. ""I bet you want to cum when you hit that send button for the last time today, don't you, my cash cow?"" She smiled. ""What do you think? Do you deserve to squirt that milk?"" Again I nodded, even though this was a pre-made video. ""Well, why don't you go ahead and do 1... 2... and 5,"" I could feel myself on the edge as I looked at the number on the screen. ""You know, I feel cruel today. So no! You don't deserve to come! I am going to snap these fingers and I want you to remain denied. If you do come... well, you'll have to send the same amount again!"" I could feel my body tense up as I tried my best to hold it in. 

""Snap!""

My whole head was spinning and it took me a moment to realise what had just happened. I looked down. Relieved to see that I was able to hold my orgasm. That I could make her proud. I opened her wishlist and sent her a coffee. As a message I typed, ""Thank you for the latest video and for denying this cash cow."" Then I got dressed and went to work.",9,1734611210.0,paypigsupportgroup,5,0.91,False

Basically I have many health issues including type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes and also, I went through a heart attack about 2 years ago.

I am focusing on lowering my cholesterol and balancing my sugar and I have all the medication to help me do that, as well, right now I'm focusing on changing the way I'm eating to assist doing this. My sugar seems to be under control for a while now, so that's not the issue.

Two months ago I started really changing how I eat.

I also suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome and that really affects the levels of my energy Since I've started changing to the way I eat I've noticed that I have a little bit more energy and I feel better. Also, I'm allergic to taking statins and I just started a new drug about 2 weeks ago, but in the past 3 months I've lowered my cholesterol by 50 points - simply by the way I eat.

I'm focusing on protein, eating 100 to 140 g of protein a day, And also trying to make sure I eat at least 30 grams of fiber a day focusing mainly on soluble fiber as much as I can. It should be about a third of your daily fiber and should be about 10 g a day.

I'm also not a meat eater., I do eat dairy but I'm finding  it easier to find protein solutions in vegan recipes. Chickpeas rule!!!!

Although I've been tracking what I've been eating on a simple Excel chart for almost 2 months now, I've started tracking what I eat on my fitness pal since 12.1.2024 and I've started looking at the breakdown of the food and the calorie source and it seems like I'm eating quite a bit of fat.  It's over 30% of the calorie source but I don't think there's anything I can change about my diet drastically,

I'm following several simple guidelines:

1. I make sure to eat 100 to 140 g of protein a day
2. to eat at least 30 grams of fiber aiming for 10 g of soluble fiber - mainly coming from food and not a supplements
3. I try to eat under 2,000 calories a day,
4. I refuse to stay hungry!

I've done that and I no longer am willing to put myself through that. Years of eating disorders are over for me !

5. I also know that I really have to avoid cheddar cheese. I LOVE cheddar cheese! cheddar cheese is probably not very good for my cholesterol. So that's the only thing that I avoid eating, although I did eat my first 100 g the other day, after an emotional day. but that's the first time I've eaten it in 3 months so I guess that's okay.

I cook. I love cooking. I meal prep.

I'm learning a lot about what food has in it I'm making my own recipes and adapting them to have more protein and more fiber. I do use protein powders and I make my own coffee with a little bit of protein powder also using oat milk instead of cow's milk means, that you get a little fiber with your coffee as well.

I'm not a big fruit eater but I make sure to eat an apple a day. With 4.5 to 5.5 g of fiber in one of these babies.

I'm just wondering if I'm eating too much fat.

I will point out that I have not weighed myself  for a while. I don't like going on the scale. I'll probably make myself do that next week just to have a number down, but I'm definitely overweight and feeling it in my body. I've always been overweight but not morbidly obese. I think I weigh somewhere between 100 to 110 kilos right now. I am tall at 5.9 ft.

My diet is filled with vegetables  and vegetarian protein sources.

Did I mention yet the chickpeas are SuperFood?

I also love lentils and as I said I don't have a problem with cooking and meal prepping, but I also don't want to be obsessed about this. I just want to feel better, lose weight and if the fat source calories are not a real problem then honestly? I don't see a point in time where I'm going to go ""when I'm done losing weight"", or ""when I'm done with this diet"" cuz I'm going to be eating like this for the rest of my life.

I'm enjoying eating, I'm enjoying cooking. I'm not hungry. I have energy and my sugar seems to be doing well.

I hope my cholesterol is going in the right direction and I have energy and that's the main thing.

(Starting form top row left to right)

Row-1

1.Rasasi Dareej: 8/10

Absolutely banger of a smell always puts me in a good mood whenever I take a whiff of it. Very different fragrance with notes of cardamom, rose, dry down is just as amazing giving floral talcum vibes. A winter scent, however can be a bit feminine to some noses. 
Had to macerate it for a few weeks to get good performance but now it lasts for days on clothes and projection is pretty good

2. Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa 7.5/10 

My first gourmand fragrance which fills the room with its insane projection and superb longevity. Notes of coffee, caramel, reminds me of a small bakery on a Sunday evening where the air is filled with the aroma of tiramisu, cappuccino and pie.
Definitely a hit or a miss but a must try for everyone 

3. Jovan musk: 7.5/10

This is what I thought luxury perfumes were when I was a kid. My father's favourite, he always has a bottle in the house. Very masculine, musky, intense, classic barbershop fragrance. Smells very much like aftershave 
The performance however doesn’t compliment its strong intense smell. Lasts for 3-5 hours on clothes

4. Beardo Godfather: 7/10

 Very liquorice kinda smell. Fruity and floral and the dry down is straight up a floral talcum powder smell.
Overspraying can give to a longer longevity but the projection remains at around an hour or so

5. Afnan 9PM: 8.5/10

This grew on me so much and it's such a good fragrance to have in your collection. Initially I couldn't get the hype behind it, was a little too Creamy and sweet for me. That was the vanilla and tonka beans I was smelling.
But after applying a few times, the heart notes are just marvelous. Ambery, sweet and aromatic fragrance.
Needs a good amount of time for maceration though. The projection and longevity is still not satisfactory as I'd have liked.

6. Villain black edp: Shit/10 

Over the top sweetness, and no longevity. Good room freshner 

7. Man only: 5.5/10

 Actually a decent smell. Floral and fruity.

8.Tranquil TMC: 6/10

 Surprisingly a good fragrance but doesn't last even and hour and doesn't project

9. Polo Black woods TMC: No absolutely no/10

 I keep it in my bathroom as a freshener 


Row-2


10. Dior Fahrenheit: 5/10

 I apologise I actually for the love of God cannot figure out what this smells like. Will rate on how gold the smell is.


11. Paco Rabanne PH: 8/10

A perfect green fragrance for the fougere loving people (including me). 
Spicy aromatic and herbal. Being and edt it still lasts on my clothes for approx 7-8 hours.
It is however a Mature fragrance.

12. Dior Sauvage Parfum: 7.5/10 

Idk man the fragrance is pretty good, classy and clean. Full with sweet, citrusy and spicy notes.
But it does not last for me. Not even on clothes. 
Longevity and projection aside it's kinda unbelievable how it can sometimes smell fresh and citrusy and spicy, woody other times

13. JPG Le male le parfum: 7/10

 I want to love this perfume but it somehow doesn't cut it for me. 
Mind you, it's a classy, spicy, woody sweet and floral smell. 
Initial projection is very good but then it fades away more quickly than you'd want it to.
Of the 7 days of the week, I'd wear this on probably 2 days but will definitely go for some better options on the other days
I find many similarities in this and Afnan 9pm

14. Mont Blanc legend: 8/10

Pineapple's freshness and a little bit of vanilla. Sweet and spicy perfect for casual everyday wear. Not that strong but also not that light.
The Edt version however doesn't last as long as it should. Around 3-4 hours of longevity and projection of 2 hours or lower.

15. Azzaro chrome legend: 100/10

Absolutely Adore the chrome lineup of Azzaro. I guess it's alright to say this perfume is pretty underrated in the community. Super fresh blue fragrance with a seaside spiciness. But the EDT concentration doesn't help it last that long. 
I somehow believe this is the fragrance James Bond must be wearing in this scene from casino royale https://pin.it/4wcFaZtce
Chrome's performance kinda varies for me as in I can at times smell it for whole day ( more than 12 hrs) and other times it reduces to a mild skin scent in 3-4 hours 

16. Versace Man eu fraiche: 9.5/10

 Wow. Swept me of my feet. This is such a fresh, soapy, shower-gell-y fragrance, a bit spicy yet a clean fragrance. 
Can't get bored smelling this on me however the ""eau fraiche"" weakens it's case as it lasts for 3, sometimes 4 hours and then turns into very mild skin scent.

17. YSL Y edp: Numbers can't rate this perfume for me its that breathtaking

 Dominique Ropion, the nose behind Y edp, has created something which can't be recreated in any way possible. Y edp is the scent I'd have if you asked me to have only one perfume for my life (let's hope it doesn't come to that) 
A fresh, aromatic, very orange-y, woody, little spicy and earthy smell.
You want projection? BAM all day projection and you can still smell it on your clothes after 5 days or so
You want versatility? BAM Y edp works for any occasion, any weather, any gender.
I swear I am not sponsored by YSL or anything xd

18. Versace Dylan blue: 9.5/10

The ""E"" in Versace stands for ""Every-perfume-we-make-is-a-banger""
Truly masculine, fresh and a gentleman fragrance. Simple yet elegant.
Gives off a bit of soapy, citrusy smell on the dry down.
Intense and strong projection in the first 2 hours then turns into a classy skin scent.

19. Mont Blanc explorer: 8.5/10

 A damn good fragrance with smoky pineapple. I take it that this a clone of creed Aventus. If so I'd definitely love Aventus as not having smelt it before.
Smoky pineapple vibe with a tropical citrusy vibe and base notes give off a fresh musky smell. Really wish it should last more as the initial projection is good but after and hour or so it reduces to a personal bubble and then disappears after 2 hours or so.

20. Lomani El paso: 6.5/10

Old timer Fougere fragrance with a bit of citrusy-lemon kick to it.
Perfect for office daily wear. Projection is average as is longevity up to 3 hours or so.
Originally a 2002 fragrance it's as old as I am, so it can be a polarizing fragrance to some people

21. Park Avenue harmony: 3/10

smells good for 2 mins then gives you a migraine


Row-3


22. Armaf deos: 7/10

All 3 are pretty good. I was actually told by a friend that Armaf's CDNIM is a masterpiece so I purchased the deodrant version thinking that they'd smell the same
In my defense I wasn't into perfumes then xd

23. Jovan sex appeal deo: 7/10

This is more strong and projects better than many of the perfumes I can think of. Somehow the fragrance is exactly what the name suggests idk how lol

24. Wild stone code body deos:

 Iridium, Titanium are the best of these copper a close second. Will surprise you with its performance 

25. Wild stone edge: 7.5/10

Ahh the budget Invictus. Having finally experienced what Invictus is like, I can tell you Zameen Aasman ka farak hai (the difference is huge).
Still Edge is a very verry good buy on a tight budget as a little overspraying will definitely make you feel as you have applied an expensive fragrance. And plus it projects for around 2-4 hours
Bubble gummy sweet, fresh scent that is super versatile.

26. Wild stone CODE edp: 

 Terra (8.5/10) absolutely blew my mind. I hadn't smelled vetiver perfumes that much so this intrigued me.
The earth spiciness, aromatic smell is amazing. Performance wise, again, a big surprise stays on my clothes for more than a full day. 
Pyro (7.5/10) and Acqua(6.5/10) both smell good initially but the former turns into an overly floral smell and the latter disappears in 20 minutes.

27. Armaf tag uomo nero: 7/10

 A spicy oud blend that I kinda like. The earthiness on the dry down is also amazing. Projection is solid but after 2 hours or so the smell transforms into a less spicy and exciting one than the opening.

28. Alhambra amber and leather: 5/10 

Raw leather smell. Very animalistic and mature and thus also, polarizing. 

29. Lataffa khamrah qahwa: 7.5/10

30. Alhambra Jorge di profumo: 6/10

The opening of this perfume gives way to a very fresh and herbal, aromatic (and iris ig) smell. But the heart and base notes fail to build up on that and it kinda doesn't complete the experience of smelling a fragrance, Iykwim. A Hollow kinda fragrance 


31. Lattafa Qaeed: 6/10

 I have realised I am not much of a fan of animalistic Oudh and leather-based perfumes.
But nevertheless a very strong blend. I was taken aback by how different this fragrance was. 
A hit or a miss.
The bottle is amazing though

32. Lattafa Asad: 7.5/10

Spicy woody and fresh, I loved the fragrance but performance is not very good and it fades away very quickly. 
Just for the fragrance however I probably will buy this next winters.

33. Titan verge:7.5/10

 fresh spiciness and lots of lemon. Smells somewhat of a lemon soap.
Really like the fragrance but performance isn't enough to justify it's price point 

34. Titan country road: 6.5/10

 I'd say this is the smell you get when you walk in the perfume area in a lifestyle or a Westside store. Performance issues still persist 

35. Titan steele: 7.5/10

 Musky and floral on the dry down. With spiciness that pierces your nose. Overall a pretty good fragrance.

36. Titan raw: 7/10

 Citrusy filled freshie with lots of orange-y smell. Performance is an issue however.
I had layered Raw once with YSL Y edp. And got a compliment from my friend. And you must know that guys don't give their guy friends compliments like ever. 
Both of these perfumes have a fresh orangey vibe

37. Titan Amalfi men: 8/10

I haven't seen anyone mention this in this sub. A solid fragrance.
Citrusy, aquatic and a hint of vetiver. Wonderful experience 
I pray to God let this last on me. Projects for an hour then surrounds you like a blanket remaining very close to the skin.

Please NOTE that this is how these fragrances smell to MY NOSE, and as we all know that each and every fragrance differs from nose to nose

P.S Can you guys please give me some tip on how to better identify notes in a fragrance? Like I haven’t smelled Bergamot or Patchouli or Balsamic to confirm that this perfume has x note in it?

This Community has helped me a lot in choosing the right perfume and not making mistakes like blind buying. Give yourselves a pat on the back guys. Its hard to find a wholesome and helpful community on reddit especially an Indian one.

Any suggestions and questions will be greatly appreciated (like what fragrances should I get next)

Thanks and Cheers !

","A few months ago, I was on a Zoom call with a startup founder, and disaster stuck. It was a brainstorming session about their brand messaging and website UX. Everything was running smoothly until that said disaster. My camera (a Logitech Brio, for those curious tech enthusiasts) decided to rebel. It tumbled right off my monitor, landing smack into my coffee cup. Yes, my precious coffee cup.From the founder’s perspective, they only saw the chaos of floating coffee before I retrieved the camera. When I finally got it back on my monitor, the sight was... not ideal. There I was, dripping with coffee from head to T-shirt. I looked like I’d just survived a very caffeinated rainstorm.We laughed—a lot. I turned off my camera to clean up, dug through my office for a spare wework T-shirt, and eventually got back on track. But that moment stuck with me for more than just its comedy value.It reminded me to stay humble. As marketers, it’s easy to get caught up in chasing perfection: sleek presentations, flashy pitches, and all the bells and whistles. But what clients and their customers are looking for isn’t perfection. They want solid, dependable solutions and real, relatable connections.That call wasn’t my proudest moment visually, but it was one of the most honest. And that honesty brought us closer, helping us collaborate better. Now, I approach storytelling and marketing with that same humility. It’s not about over-the-top perfection; it’s about substance and authenticity.So, if your next “perfect pitch” gets drenched in coffee—literally or metaphorically—just roll with it. The best stories (and strategies) are born in those messy, unpolished moments.",1,1734610696.0,Entrepreneur,5,0.6,False

Basically I have many health issues including type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes and also, I went through a heart attack about 2 years ago.

I am focusing on lowering my cholesterol and balancing my sugar and I have all the medication to help me do that, as well, right now I'm focusing on changing the way I'm eating to assist doing this. My sugar seems to be under control for a while now, so that's not the issue.

Two months ago I started really changing how I eat.

I also suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome and that really affects the levels of my energy Since I've started changing to the way I eat I've noticed that I have a little bit more energy and I feel better. Also, I'm allergic to taking statins and I just started a new drug about 2 weeks ago, but in the past 3 months I've lowered my cholesterol by 50 points - simply by the way I eat.

I'm focusing on protein, eating 100 to 140 g of protein a day, And also trying to make sure I eat at least 30 grams of fiber a day focusing mainly on soluble fiber as much as I can. It should be about a third of your daily fiber and should be about 10 g a day.

I'm also not a meat eater., I do eat dairy but I'm finding  it easier to find protein solutions in vegan recipes. Chickpeas rule!!!!

Although I've been tracking what I've been eating on a simple Excel chart for almost 2 months now, I've started tracking what I eat on my fitness pal since 12.1.2024 and I've started looking at the breakdown of the food and the calorie source and it seems like I'm eating quite a bit of fat.  It's over 30% of the calorie source but I don't think there's anything I can change about my diet drastically,

I'm following several simple guidelines:

1. I make sure to eat 100 to 140 g of protein a day
2. to eat at least 30 grams of fiber aiming for 10 g of soluble fiber - mainly coming from food and not a supplements
3. I try to eat under 2,000 calories a day,
4. I refuse to stay hungry!

I've done that and I no longer am willing to put myself through that. Years of eating disorders are over for me !

5. I also know that I really have to avoid cheddar cheese. I LOVE cheddar cheese! cheddar cheese is probably not very good for my cholesterol. So that's the only thing that I avoid eating, although I did eat my first 100 g the other day, after an emotional day. but that's the first time I've eaten it in 3 months so I guess that's okay.

I cook. I love cooking. I meal prep.

I'm learning a lot about what food has in it I'm making my own recipes and adapting them to have more protein and more fiber. I do use protein powders and I make my own coffee with a little bit of protein powder also using oat milk instead of cow's milk means, that you get a little fiber with your coffee as well.

I'm not a big fruit eater but I make sure to eat an apple a day. With 4.5 to 5.5 g of fiber in one of these babies.

I'm just wondering if I'm eating too much fat.

I will point out that I have not weighed myself  for a while. I don't like going on the scale. I'll probably make myself do that next week just to have a number down, but I'm definitely overweight and feeling it in my body. I've always been overweight but not morbidly obese. I think I weigh somewhere between 100 to 110 kilos right now. I am tall at 5.9 ft.

My diet is filled with vegetables  and vegetarian protein sources.

Did I mention yet the chickpeas are SuperFood?

I also love lentils and as I said I don't have a problem with cooking and meal prepping, but I also don't want to be obsessed about this. I just want to feel better, lose weight and if the fat source calories are not a real problem then honestly? I don't see a point in time where I'm going to go ""when I'm done losing weight"", or ""when I'm done with this diet"" cuz I'm going to be eating like this for the rest of my life.

I'm enjoying eating, I'm enjoying cooking. I'm not hungry. I have energy and my sugar seems to be doing well.

I hope my cholesterol is going in the right direction and I have energy and that's the main thing.

(My fitness is in very bad shape. The worse it's ever been. Going back to track steps since that's always seem to be a good way for me to go. I've been tracking steps since 12.1.2024. My goal for this entire month is to walk 3,000 steps every day. and try to walk a little more each week on my weekly average. I will also be starting to work out in a program for making sure I'm ok with my heart. Just have to finish doing some tests first. So i'm ok and will get better).",2,1734610572.0,diet,4,1.0,False

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

I also suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome and that really affects the levels of my energy Since I've started changing to the way I eat I've noticed that I have a little bit more energy and I feel better. Also, I'm allergic to taking statins and I just started a new drug about 2 weeks ago, but in the past 3 months I've lowered my cholesterol by 50 points - simply by the way I eat.

I'm focusing on protein, eating 100 to 140 g of protein a day, And also trying to make sure I eat at least 30 grams of fiber a day focusing mainly on soluble fiber as much as I can. It should be about a third of your daily fiber and should be about 10 g a day.

I'm also not a meat eater., I do eat dairy but I'm finding  it easier to find protein solutions in vegan recipes. Chickpeas rule!!!!

Although I've been tracking what I've been eating on a simple Excel chart for almost 2 months now, I've started tracking what I eat on my fitness pal since 12.1.2024 and I've started looking at the breakdown of the food and the calorie source and it seems like I'm eating quite a bit of fat.  It's over 30% of the calorie source but I don't think there's anything I can change about my diet drastically,

I'm following several simple guidelines:

1. I make sure to eat 100 to 140 g of protein a day
2. to eat at least 30 grams of fiber aiming for 10 g of soluble fiber - mainly coming from food and not a supplements
3. I try to eat under 2,000 calories a day,
4. I refuse to stay hungry!

I've done that and I no longer am willing to put myself through that. Years of eating disorders are over for me !

5. I also know that I really have to avoid cheddar cheese. I LOVE cheddar cheese! cheddar cheese is probably not very good for my cholesterol. So that's the only thing that I avoid eating, although I did eat my first 100 g the other day, after an emotional day. but that's the first time I've eaten it in 3 months so I guess that's okay.

I cook. I love cooking. I meal prep.

I'm learning a lot about what food has in it I'm making my own recipes and adapting them to have more protein and more fiber. I do use protein powders and I make my own coffee with a little bit of protein powder also using oat milk instead of cow's milk means, that you get a little fiber with your coffee as well.

I'm not a big fruit eater but I make sure to eat an apple a day. With 4.5 to 5.5 g of fiber in one of these babies.

I'm just wondering if I'm eating too much fat.

I will point out that I have not weighed myself  for a while. I don't like going on the scale. I'll probably make myself do that next week just to have a number down, but I'm definitely overweight and feeling it in my body. I've always been overweight but not morbidly obese. I think I weigh somewhere between 100 to 110 kilos right now. I am tall at 5.9 ft.

My diet is filled with vegetables  and vegetarian protein sources.

Did I mention yet the chickpeas are SuperFood?

I also love lentils and as I said I don't have a problem with cooking and meal prepping, but I also don't want to be obsessed about this. I just want to feel better, lose weight and if the fat source calories are not a real problem then honestly? I don't see a point in time where I'm going to go ""when I'm done losing weight"", or ""when I'm done with this diet"" cuz I'm going to be eating like this for the rest of my life.

I'm enjoying eating, I'm enjoying cooking. I'm not hungry. I have energy and my sugar seems to be doing well.

I hope my cholesterol is going in the right direction and I have energy and that's the main thing.

(My fitness is in very bad shape. The worse it's ever been. Going back to track steps since that's always seem to be a good way for me to go. I've been tracking steps since 12.1.2024. My goal for this entire month is to walk 3,000 steps every day. and try to walk a little more each week on my weekly average. I will also be starting to work out in a program for making sure I'm ok with my heart. Just have to finish doing some tests first. So i'm ok and will get better).",1,1734610332.0,Protein,0,1.0,False

Like 2-3 times a year or less. Couldn't take a ECG while in an episode, so doctor couldn't identify and prescribe medication. My heart was 62% functional. Recently about 3 month ago I was having severe breathing problem randomly. Got checked and it was my small hital hernia and h. Pylori infection. Got cured. Now I'm having a issue of having low blood pressure and above normal heart rate even though I was just laying down. Around 90 heart rate and 90/60 BP.
I am feeling low on stamina everytime I go out(I take stairs from 4th floor). What could be the reason? I drink around 3 liters of water everyday, and I last drank coffee or tea 1+ years ago. Thank you.",1,1734610316.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
