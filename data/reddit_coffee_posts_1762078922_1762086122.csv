( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

### Pro Tips for Nailing the Stocking Stuffer Game

*   **Go for Consumables:** Things like coffee, snacks, fancy soap, and candles get used up, making room for new things next year. It’s the gift that keeps on giving (and then disappears).
*   **Think Practicality:** What is something they use every day that could be upgraded? A cheap plastic sponge could become a fancy, wooden dish brush. A messy toiletries bag could become a hanging travel organizer.
*   **Personalize It:** Anything with a name, initial, or inside joke on it automatically feels more special. A keychain, a notebook, a mug... the options are endless.
*   **It's Not About the Price:** The best stocking stuffers are thoughtful, not expensive. A $5 bottle of their favorite hot sauce means more than a $20 random gadget.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Hey lurker,

I’m 35, 1.85m tall, sporty, and secretly convinced that life’s too short for bad Wi-Fi or boring meals. By day I work in IT, by night I might be outside hiking, trying out a new recipe, or hopping on a fire truck as a volunteer firefighter (yes, the uniform is real 😉).

I like to stay active, laugh often, and enjoy the little things—sunsets, fresh coffee, or cooking dinner for two. I’m looking for someone who’s just as curious, outdoorsy, loves a good book and up for spontaneous adventures as I am.

1omfm09,https://www.reddit.com/r/diving/comments/1omfm09/panic_attacks_for_the_first_time/,Panic attacks for the first time.,"Hello guys, got a problem here which I hope I can get your opinion from both professional and non. 

I have been diving for 24 years now and am a cerified DM (albeit inactive, I do mostly recreational dives) with over 7k+ dives under my belt.

Last year(2024) I was on a dive trip and on the first dive I felt paranoia while descending. The feeling I could describe was being paranoid of the surrounding ( which is unusual because I have dived here many mnay times). I was breathing very fast and hard. I was diving with my wife (my buddy) and some other friends who were very experienced divers. I had this panic which I thought my heart would seized up and I would die. I just wanted to abort dive and a send but that feeling went away after awhile. So I decided to continue the dive. All went well till the next dive. Same thing happened, and this time I aborted dive. On both dives, surface was calm with minimum current throughout. After the aborted dive I decided to sit out for the remainder of the trip. 

This really upsets me alot cos I love diving. 

While reflecting on the incident, I thought to myself, could that been a heart attack? So when I'm back home, I went to see a cardiologist and did the whole array test from ecg, stress test and even echo sound. All is good and the doctor told me he isn't worried about my heart at all. Test came back all good. 

However after this whole episode, I would occasionally get that paranoia and panicked feeling even when I'm not diving. It can even happen while driving. It took me awhile to think what could have been the trigger for my attacks, and ultimately I pinned it to coffee. I usually have a cup of black coffee in the morning, something I have been doing so for the longest time. So I thought, maybe I should stop and see if it was indeed caffeine that is causing these attacks. 

I have been off coffee now for almost 11 months and I'm glad to say the attacks stopped. 

My reason for this post is to ask for your opinion/experience in this matter as to whether if it's coffee or there's another cause for my attacks underwater. 

I've been itching to get back underwater so I would appreciate all help. 

Thank you! ",1,1762085303.0,diving,0,1.0,False

1omflga,https://www.reddit.com/r/JollyDecorAndGifts/comments/1omflga/say_goodbye_to_boring_fillers_the_ultimate/,Say Goodbye to Boring Fillers: The Ultimate Stocking Stuffers Guide for 2025,"Let's be real. We've all been there. Christmas morning, you reach into your stocking with high hopes, and what do you pull out? A pack of three mismatched socks, a candy cane that's been sitting in a box since last year, and a flimsy plastic comb. *Cringe.*

The era of the ""just-fill-it-up"" stocking is OVER. In 2025, stocking stuffers are all about thoughtful, useful, and ridiculously cool gifts that deliver a huge punch in a tiny package. This isn't about cheap trinkets; it's about curated surprises that make someone's day.

So, let’s ditch the junk and stuff those stockings with gifts people will actually *love*. Here is your definitive, 2025-approved guide to the best stocking stuffers.

---

### 🚀 For the Tech Enthusiast: Smart & Sleek Gadgets

The tech lover in your life doesn't want another cheap cable. They want the next little thing that makes life easier, cooler, or more fun.

*   **AI-Powered Smart Tag (like a next-gen Tile or AirTag):** The 2025 versions come with features like left-behind alerts powered by local AI networks and even a ""find my phone"" function that works when your phone is dead.
*   **Portable Mini Projector:** These are no longer clunky. The newest models are the size of a soda can and can turn any wall into a 100-inch movie screen. Perfect for movie night on the go.
*   **High-Speed Multi-Port Charging Cube:** A no-brainer. Look for one with at least 65W of power, USB-C, and USB-A ports to charge a laptop, phone, and earbuds all at once. Anker and UGREEN are crushing this space.
*   **Smart Reusable Notebook:** Think a whiteboard that fits in your pocket. Write notes, scan them to the cloud with a dedicated app (often with AI transcription!), and then wipe the page clean. Eco-friendly and super practical.
*   **Thermal-Color Changing Mug:** A simple concept, but endlessly satisfying. Watch the design magically appear when you pour in a hot drink. It's the little things.

### 🌿 For the Eco-Conscious: Sustainable & Stylish Swaps

This person values products that are kind to the planet. Focus on reusable materials, plastic-free packaging, and items that replace wasteful disposables.

*   **Solid toiletries:** Think shampoo bars, conditioner bars, and even solid toothpaste tablets. They're perfect for travel, last longer than liquids, and create zero plastic waste. Brands like Ethique and Lush are go-to's.
*   **Reusable Silicone Stretch Lids:** A set of these can replace a whole drawer of plastic wrap and mismatched Tupperware lids. They stretch to fit over bowls, cans, and even half-cut fruit.
*   **Seed Paper Ornaments or Bookmarks:** A beautiful card or decoration embedded with seeds. After the holidays, they can plant it and grow wildflowers or herbs. It's a gift that keeps on living.
*   **A High-Quality Reusable Coffee Cup:** Not just any travel mug. Look for one with superior insulation, a leak-proof design (like a Stojo or a KeepCup), and made from materials like recycled coffee grounds or bamboo fiber.
*   **Bee's Wrap or Vegan Food Wraps:** A natural, reusable alternative to plastic wrap. Made from cotton coated in beeswax (or a plant-based wax for a vegan option), they're perfect for wrapping up cheese, bread, or leftovers.

### ✨ For the Self-Care Savant: Tiny Luxuries for Big Relaxation

This person is all about wellness, mindfulness, and creating a sanctuary. Their stocking should be an assortment of tiny treats that help them unwind and recharge.

*   **Mini Essential Oil Rollerball:** A pre-diluted blend in a convenient rollerball bottle. Think calming lavender for sleep, energizing citrus for the morning, or a focus blend with peppermint and rosemary.
*   **High-End Sleep Mask:** Not the flimsy freebie one from a flight. Look for a 3D contoured mask that blocks 100% of light without putting pressure on the eyes (like a Manta Sleep Mask).
*   **Gourmet Hot Chocolate Bomb:** A sphere of rich chocolate that you place in a mug and pour hot milk over, watching it melt to reveal marshmallows and cocoa. It’s a ritual in a ball.
*   **Acupressure Ring or Mat:** A small, spiky ring you roll up and down your finger to relieve tension and promote focus. It’s weirdly satisfying and surprisingly effective.
*   **Silk Pillowcase:** A game-changer for hair and skin. A standard pillowcase is too big, but a silk *eye mask* or *hair scrunchie* fits perfectly and offers a touch of everyday luxury.

### 🍫 For the Foodie: Gourmet Bites & Sips

Forget the generic candy canes. The modern foodie craves unique flavors, artisan quality, and anything that makes their kitchen life more delicious.

*   **Fancy finishing salt:** A small jar of flaky sea salt, truffle salt, or smoked salt can elevate any dish from good to gourmet.
*   **Single-Origin Chocolate Bar:** Skip the Hershey's. Go for a bar with a high cacao percentage from a specific region (like Ecuador or Madagascar). The flavor difference is mind-blowing.
*   **Gourmet Hot Sauce Sampler:** For the person who puts chili on everything. Find a set with unique flavors like peach-habanero, ghost pepper blueberry, or a smoky chipotle.
*   **Mini Cocktail Bitters Set:** A tiny bottle of aromatic or orange bitters is the key to a perfect old-fashioned or Manhattan. It’s the mark of a true home bartender.
*   **Flavored Simple Syrup:** A small bottle of lavender, rosemary, or ginger simple syrup can instantly upgrade their morning coffee or evening cocktail.

### 🎁 Pro-Tip: The ""Rule of 3"" for Stocking Stuffers in 2025

To avoid just cramming stuff in, follow this simple formula for each person’s stocking:

1.  **Something Useful:** A gift they'll actually use and appreciate (like the charging cube or the reusable lids).
2.  **Something Indulgent:** A treat they wouldn't necessarily buy for themselves (like the gourmet chocolate or the fancy salt).
3.  **Something Fun/Silly:** A small toy, a unique gadget, or something that makes them laugh (like the color-changing mug).

This formula ensures a balanced, thoughtful, and exciting stocking every single time.

1omfgtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1omfgtx/thoughts_on_the_game_after_2_playthroughs/,Thoughts on the game after 2 playthroughs,"I recently bought the game after a long hesitation given all the really bad reviews it had received.  
I’ve played two games so far (one with Charlemagne and another with Pachacuti) after the 1.2.5 update, and I must say that the game turned out to be a nice surprise. Of course it’s far from perfect, but clearly not as bad as people make it sound on the Internet.

So here are my thoughts on the game (the good, the okay/could be better, and the bad)



**The Good:**

* As usual, the music is great.
* The map is beautiful!
* I liked the age system (at least the idea  I’ll expand later). Previous games tended to become quite tedious after the end of Antiquity, except when you were at war. The age system is a very good mechanic in the sense that it helps shorten long, uneventful periods: as the end of an age approaches, you try to gather legacy points, avoid falling into a dark age, and prepare for the next one. And at the beginning of a new age, you regain the excitement of the early turns as you reorganize your cities, rebuild your armies, and so on. The system also allows the player to focus on different parts of the gameplay (basic development in Antiquity, religion and exploration during the Exploration Age, ideology - yes, I know that it is really poorly implemented for now - in the Modern Age).
* Something that came with the age system and was REALLY hated is civilization switching. I liked it in *Humankind*, and I like it here too. It adds more combinations and flexibility to the gameplay! For me, *Civ* games were never “alt-history” games but more like historical board games with extra steps - if you want real history, just play any Paradox title. The current selection of civs and leaders is diverse and interesting.
* City organization is fun, and the replacement of old buildings fits perfectly into the gameplay - except for one particularly annoying detail. I can’t think of any real improvement to the current building choices.
* The split between cities and towns is a nice addition. It reduces micromanagement and allows for a “tall” playstyle (kinda).
* Resource categories are fine once you get past the poor in-game explanations (for instance, I didn’t realize at first that you can stack factory resources in one city).
* The evolution of city-states/barbarians was a nice touch.
* Finally - omg - the game is so smooth! How has nobody mentioned that? I was used to waiting a full minute between turns at the end of a game, and now I can't even take a break to drink my coffee!



**The OK / Could Be Better**

* The trade system is good *in* theory - you create a trade route, then you gain access to the city’s resources. Simple, right? So why make it so complicated that you have no idea what your merchants are doing??? I can basically group this issue into a broader problem that I’ll discuss later: the awful UI.
* Diplomacy has good and bad sides. I love how the relationship between you and other players is now an actual value instead of just an indicator, and how it can even affect your power during war. However, something is definitely missing when it comes to trade cities - and I don’t understand why there isn’t a proper trade system.
* War is alright, I guess - not much has changed since the last game. It’s a bit messy sometimes, but I liked the commander system.
* The heritage system (at least during the first two ages) is interesting in most aspects - the parts that aren’t are detailed below.



**The Bad**

* The UI!!! After my first game, I immediately installed a bunch of mods to improve information visibility because it was just impossible to understand what was going on by the end. This is by far the worst part of the game for me.
* The economic model (IRL, not in-game): I know it’s becoming the norm, but seriously, what’s going on with a $25 DLC for four leaders and two civs? It feels like they intentionally cut content from an $80 game just to sell it later. In my opinion, people are tired of this crap - and that’s one of the reasons the game sold so poorly at launch.
* As I said, I like the age system - but some of its mechanics are really poorly implemented. Basically, anything related to culture is bad: religion, artifacts, and oh god, ideology! These parts of the game should be reworked as a priority because they really lack depth or interest. I did like the treasure fleet and factory resource systems though.
* I don’t care about mementos or the metagame - I’m not going to play 100 games with the same leader anyway.
* The endgame and victory types are terrible. Some people say they cut gameplay content for a potential fourth age, but personally, I think three ages are a good split (remember, one of the biggest criticisms of *Humankind* was that every era was too short and felt impersonal). Why are we still collecting heritage points throughout the third age? And all the victory types feel the same - just a rebranded scientific victory with a bomb or a banker.



**--> So what can be done ?** We currently have six attributes, but only four of them are tied to a victory/heritage. There’s nothing for diplomacy (are they planning to add that in a DLC?) or expansionism.  
To this, I would add two more categories that should exist - industrial (based on production) and development (based on food and city growth).  
In the end, my overly rigid brain would prefer to see either eight legacies/victory types, or four legacies/victory types that combine two categories (commercial/industrial, military/expansionist, scientific/development & cultural/diplomatic).

The main point is that these paths should all feel different. For example, a military victory could involve using a nuclear bomb, while an expansionist victory could require controlling a certain number of colonies. A diplomatic victory through a UN-style congress is a huge missing feature right now, and I’d also love to see a development victory where you need a city with a certain population and happiness level.



I still want to trust the devs for future additions, and expect that they will not fall for the people that just wanted another *Civ VI*... ",6,1762084843.0,civ,1,1.0,False

The most realistic part about this movie was the hippie woman who said they didn't care about the civil war. Lots of countries have had civil wars in modern times, but no country has talked as much about the possibility of it as the US. 


It's not just a left wing thing either. I remember back when Obama was president and US conservatives talked endlessly about how there would soon be a civil war, and how they were going to have to fight back against the government. 


The funny thing is that they already had guns, unlike in Yugoslavia or Syria were people had to find a way to get guns, but they still didn't do anything. The real reason why they never did anything, and the real reason why the anti-Trump left will never do anything, is that it would disrupt the flow of cheeseburgers and Starbucks coffee. 


Lots of people are talking about how this movie is a prophecy for the future. Here's a more accurate prophecy; 
Trump declares that he wants to run in 2028, then he is refused, so he makes a bunch of threats, then people just tell him that he has no power over it, then he will claim it was all a joke. 


Then a democrat will win in 2028 because the pendulum was already in motion.

Anyway, I was on a coffee date, and mid-conversation, I decided to casually show off my new tech. I tapped the screen like I knew what I was doing, which I absolutely did not.

Instead of showing the time, it started blasting some kind of alarm sound I didn’t even know it had. I panicked and tried to turn it off, but it kept switching between modes, stopwatch, heart rate, something called yoga breathing, and then a screen that just said “SYNC ERROR” in bright red.

Meanwhile, my date’s just staring, sipping her latte, watching me lose a 1v1 battle with my own wrist.

Finally, I just muttered something like, “It’s calibrating,” which I think made it worse because the watch immediately started vibrating like it was trying to escape.

I ended up taking it off, stuffing it in my pocket, and pretending it never happened. The best part? My phone started buzzing 10 minutes later because apparently the Wokai watch had decided I was in distress and sent a health alert notification.

So now I can’t even fake competence with wearable tech. If you ever want to feel humbled, try showing off a gadget you don’t understand in front of someone you’re trying to impress. Works every time.

Has anyone else ever tried to show off something that immediately betrayed you? Bonus points if it was in public.

I tried changing the subject multiple times but he just kept circling back to his ex. When our food came - I ordered chicken fried rice and he got some pasta - he literally took a phone call at the table and talked for like ten minutes while I just sat there eating alone.

The worst part was when the check came, he made this big show of reaching for his wallet then was like """"oh we're splitting this right?"""" after he'd suggested the restaurant and ordered two drinks to my one glass of water.

I paid my half just to get out of there faster and he had the audacity to ask if I wanted to get coffee sometime. I said I'd think about it which obviously means no, but I didn't have the energy to reject him directly after that whole ordeal.

Anyways, it will come I am still in full belief of an AltSeason and a lot of coins are dying. This liquidity and man power ain't just gonna disappear, we will see a great migration into established coins that have stuck around and haven't reduced their output as the market struggles alongside us.

Crypto is a very funny game, nothing happens for months and then things happen at once. This is why I believe **Conviction** is the single most important thing, you need to truly believe in something, through rain, hail or snow.

This is why I pick **Kendu,** we have so many IRL initiatives coming out day after day, all community led too, whilst also dominating Reddit, X and Stocktwits.

Here is our IRL product list:

* Kendu Coffee
* Kendu Energy
* Kendu Merch
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation 
* Kendu Board Game
* Kendu Creator
* Kendu Jewellery
* Kendu Beer
* Kendu Video Games
* Tattoos

* Kendu Vendu
* Kendu Press 
* Kendu Hand Cream
* Kendu Discs
* Kendu Sneakers
* Kendu Spice
* Kendu Radio Show
* Kendu Brilliance
* Kendu Unleashed

These IRL efforts combined with the social media work force of dreams makes Kendu impossible to ignore. You should at least DYOR and join our tg you have nothing to lose but some time and the upside is massive.

Where else do you see a project have an output like Kendu?

Exactly, there is no others, even those in the billions cannot match Kendu's community output.

Now if I take it on a full stomach (protein meal in morning before) then there is literally no effect and I feel the same adhd symptoms in full force again.

I do not know what i should do or how to take it and my Psych is on leave till next year. Trying to get a stand in Psych to have a session and discuss this.

1omf3gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/florence/comments/1omf3gj/the_best_meal_ive_ever_had_was_in_florence/,The best meal I’ve ever had was in Florence,"Firenze, we miss you so much. Husband and I were already contemplating how we can make a move to Europe, and now, Florence is the top of our list. He already loved it from studying here in college, and I am now head over heels in love. This city is incredible, the people, the energy, the art, the history. We’re in Rome now and quite frankly miserable, we want to go back to our lovely Florence! (It’s my first time in Italy so I wanted to see Rome and Venice, too) Maybe it’s because we’re from NYC, but we’re over overcrowded cities, and Florence is the best of both: a less busy city, with a ways to get out to calmer, tranquil green spaces.

To the point: I already left a glowing review on Google but wanted to shout them out here, too. Osteria Giglio d'oro is quite frankly the best meal I’ve ever had, period, let alone in Italy. My mom grew up in a restaurant family and is a gifted cook, and where we live is obviously known for its food. To say: our standards are HIGH for food. 

Warning: We definitely overdid it this meal and ordered some weird combos, forgive us. It was one of our last nights there and we wanted to try a bit of everything :) 

We paired this meal with a white wine, Ruffino Libaio Toscana. Maybe this is a standard wine here, but we already have checked to *make sure* we can get it in the states. It was ICE cold, as a white wine should be, and it paired beautifully with every course. We started with the truffle tartar with fondue and salad. The dressing on the salad lightened the richness of the fondue, and added a lovely crunch. They were NOT shy about the truffles, either, and I am a truffle pig, so this was a delight. Delicious, and the staff seemed to be happy we were ordered this. Definitely a specific taste so maybe it’s not ordered frequently? Next was ribolitta, and hooooooooly moly this lived up to the hype. My husband has talked about this for years after studying here, and he’s a great chef, but the authentic thing was truly out of this world. Hoping he picked up some pointers because the authentic thing was top tier. Such a simple dish but their use of the parmigiana and their bread… UGH so good. For any unfamiliar: Ribolitta is a “peasant’s” dish that uses mostly vegetables and beans, along with the aforementioned bread and cheese to thicken. Stick to your ribs, simple, yet DELICIOUS — also vegetarian friendly! 

 
Onto the star of the show: The taglioni al parmigiano e tartufo fresco. I saw God. This pasta, made in house fresh, with the white truffle…… this was a religious experience. This is the dish I’ll be thinking about every day until we can get back to Florence. The delicacy of the white truffle was so gentle, but better than any truffle dish I’ve had. I nearly cried, it was really THAT good. I wasn’t expecting white truffle, it’s more expensive (more on that later).

We ended with cappuccino (I know, I know, we’re American lol) that was great, and their house made tiramisu. This was unlike any tiramisu I’ve ever had in the best way. Admittedly, this is one of the only dishes I can make, and was proud of…. Yeah I *thought* I could, my version is a sad excuse compared to this. The coffee flavor was perfect, and they used a custard? We think? as the cream. My. GOD. What a delight.

The meal was obviously, amazing, but I also want to highlight the staff. The person who sat us was so fun, maybe the owner? At the end we told him emphatically how much we loved our meal, and he certainly appreciated it. The waitstaff, one young woman and and an older gentleman, were SO nice, appreciated we tried and were patient with our low level of Italian, helped “teach” us some words, made jokes, and took such good care of us. Especially the woman, I’m so sorry for not getting her name. I wanted to give her credit, specifically, because not only does she speak English and Italian, but also French and I believe she said Portuguese? QUEEN!!!! I overheard one table ask for something with “red sauce,” another table leave after they didn’t have something “four cheeses” (which I realize Italy does have a dish like this, but sounds like she wanted perhaps the Olive Garden version and left when they didn’t have it…..), and another tourist literally HIT HER ON HER BUTT to get her attention. Like??? She should not have to deal with that, and remained polite and patient with everyone. Better than I could ever do. We tipped her well but wish we could have left more. The first two sets of tourists I described were American, so for them, I apologize. I get it, Americans, specifically, can be so culturally ignorant. We try to be polite “guests” when we travel, not “tourists,” because being from NYC, we know they can be exhausting. Do your research about the culture, be polite, and be kind. You would think these are the bare minimum, and yet…  

For this experience, we shared all the dishes, and it was more than enough. It was about €100, which seems BANANAS for how amazing the food was. As I mentioned we’re in Rome now, and last night went to a well-known spot known for their truffle tasting menu. For over double the price, it was fine. Good, not great. Had we gotten white truffle, it would have triple the price of my delicious, heaven-sent pasta from Giglio.

TL/DR: For being so close to the Duomo, the price, and the quality of food, Osteria giglio d’oro is a must. Tourist, “guest,” or local. Grazie mille, è eccezionale!! ♥️",5,1762083560.0,florence,0,0.86,False

They were cheap and have lasted me for over 8 years but the sound quality is frankly dog ass (I daily drive a pair of beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs at home, that should *hopefully* give you an idea of what level of sound quality I'm used to)

The SPM-435s seem to be really good for the price, but I can't get over the connector. I'm gonna be mainly using them when listening to/mixing music on the go and I *burn* through cheap earbuds/headphone cable because the wire always breaks near the connector when I have my phone in my pocket and frankly I'm not putting in the effort to repair something that cost me like $20. So I figured I would shell out more for a pair of IEMs that sound way better, would last me longer and are (probably) more servicable.

I also often play rhythm games and simply want my gear to be as compatible with each other as possible so wireless for me is a big no no.

1omf2nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1omf2nl/dating_again_after_6_years_and_i_may_be/,Dating again after 6 years and I may be overthinking,"About halfway through this year I (29M) broke up with my fiancée after a 6-year relationship. I started using Hinge about 1.5 months ago, and within a day I matched with a woman (31F) who I clicked with pretty quickly. I organised a small coffee date/walk, it went well, and we have seen each other every weekend for the first month of talking/dating (the last two weeks we’ve both been busy/sick).

She left a 15-year relationship earlier this year after her ex cheated on her, and understandably that’s really shaken her confidence. She also hasn’t dated since high school, so she’s basically relearning how dating works.

The thing I’m noticing is that I’m doing most of the heavy lifting; planning dates, initiating meet-ups, keeping things moving. I genuinely don’t mind putting in effort, but it’s starting to make me a bit unsure of where I stand. She’s assertive and confident in other areas of her life, but with dating she gets pretty hesitant to take initiative, even though she clearly enjoys our time together.

At the end of our last date, we kissed and I asked what she wanted out of this, and she said she’s happy to just see where things go but doesn't want to jump into anything serious right away (same for me). That reassured me she’s interested, but the imbalance in effort still sticks out.

What I’m trying to figure out is: Is this just someone rebuilding confidence after a long, painful breakup, or an early sign of a one-sided dynamic that might continue long-term?

I really like what i've seen of her so far, and I don’t want to rush her or make her feel criticised. But I also don’t want to fall into a dynamic where I’m always the one initiating and carrying the momentum.

Has anyone been through something similar? How do you communicate wanting more effort and reciprocity without making someone who’s been hurt feel pressured? I also may be overthinking things which I tend to do.",1,1762083483.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1omf0sn,https://www.reddit.com/r/scuba/comments/1omf0sn/panick_attacks_for_the_first_time/,Panick attacks for the first time.,"Hello guys, got a problem here which I hope I can get your opinion from both professional and non. 

I have been diving for 24 years now and am a cerified DM (albeit inactive, I do mostly recreational dives) with over 7k+ dives under my belt.

Last year(2024) I was on a dive trip and on the first dive I felt paranoia while descending. The feeling I could describe was being paranoid of the surrounding ( which is unusual because I have dived here many mnay times). I was breathing very fast and hard. I was diving with my wife (my buddy) and some other friends who were very experienced divers. I had this panic which I thought my heart would seized up and I would die. I just wanted to abort dive and a send but that feeling went away after awhile. So I decided to continue the dive. All went well till the next dive. Same thing happened, and this time I aborted dive. On both dives, surface was calm with minimum current throughout. After the aborted dive I decided to sit out for the remainder of the trip. 

This really upsets me alot cos I love diving. 

While reflecting on the incident, I thought to myself, could that been a heart attack? So when I'm back home, I went to see a cardiologist and did the whole array test from ecg, stress test and even echo sound. All is good and the doctor told me he isn't worried about my heart at all. Test came back all good. 

However after this whole episode, I would occasionally get that paranoia and panicked feeling even when I'm not diving. It can even happen while driving. It took me awhile to think what could have been the trigger for my attacks, and ultimately I pinned it to coffee. I usually have a cup of black coffee in the morning, something I have been doing so for the longest time. So I thought, maybe I should stop and see if it was indeed caffeine that is causing these attacks. 

I have been off coffee now for almost 11 months and I'm glad to say the attacks stopped. 

My reason for this post is to ask for your opinion/experience in this matter as to whether if it's coffee or there's another cause for my attacks underwater. 

I've been itching to get back underwater so I would appreciate all help. 

Thank you! ",4,1762083298.0,scuba,2,1.0,False
1omf0ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1omf0ig/how_to_stop_obsessing_over_finding_a_partner_and/,How to stop obsessing over finding a partner (and actually enjoy being single),"Lately, I’ve noticed more and more people, friends, coworkers, random comments on Reddit, feeling this low-key constant pressure to *find someone*. Like being single is some kind of temporary glitch that needs to be fixed. Dating apps fuel it, TikTok is full of people romanticizing relationships or dunking on being lonely, and IG makes it seem like everyone is in a perfect couple except you. The vibe is, if you’re single, you’re either doing something wrong or you’re incomplete.

So here’s the truth: wanting a partner is normal. But *needing* one to feel fulfilled? That's a mental trap. After going through dozens of books, interviews, and research papers, and seeing how warped this topic gets online, especially by algorithm-chasing content creators, I put together this ultimate sanity guide to help you stop craving a relationship like it's oxygen. And no, it’s not about becoming cold or a lone wolf. It’s about real independence, emotional regulation, and enjoying your life like it’s already full.

Here’s what actually helps (straight from science and smart thinkers, not TikTok thirst traps):

* **Start by disrupting the fantasy cycle**
  * *Your brain loves fantasy.* It’s wired to crave dopamine, and romantic imagery gives you a hit. According to Dr. Helen Fisher, biological anthropologist and expert on love, ""romantic love is a drive more powerful than the sex drive."" It’s literally an addiction system.
  * *Stop feeding the loop.* That means less daydreaming, fewer rom-coms, and muting those “relationship goals” accounts. Not forever, just while you’re recalibrating.
  * *Use active coping instead.* Replace mental fantasizing with active visualization of goals that don’t involve anyone else, career, travel, fitness. This trains your reward system to associate dopamine with *you*, not a fantasy partner.

* **Understand the “partner craving” is often emotional displacement**
  * Relationship desire is rarely about romance. It's often a placeholder for something else, belonging, self-worth, identity. Psychologist Dr. Alexandra Solomon calls this “love as a bandage.”
  * Instead of asking “why am I still single?”, ask:
    * “When do I crave a relationship the most?”
    * “What emotion is underneath that, boredom, fear, insecurity?”
    * “What would I be doing right now if I felt fully safe and content alone?”
  * This breaks the illusion that a partner will automatically fix those emotions. They won’t. You will.

* **Train solitude like a skill, not a punishment**
  * Psychotherapist Esther Perel explains that “modern love is burdened by the quest for self-actualization.” We project all our unmet needs onto one person. That’s why solitude feels scary, it’s unfamiliar.
  * Practice “positive solitude”:
    * Go to a movie or restaurant alone, without your phone. Let yourself feel awkward, then let it pass.
    * Spend a weekend offline, just reading, cleaning, walking, reflecting.
    * Build a solo ritual, journaling, silent morning coffee, a music walk. Something just yours.
  * The more competence you build in being alone, the less reliant you become on others to soothe you.

* **Audit your beliefs about relationships**
  * A big part of the craving comes from unconscious beliefs. According to Terri Cole, therapist and author of *Boundary Boss*, many people have “downloaded love blueprints” from childhood or culture that make them chase love to feel worthy.
  * Try this:
    * Write down your core beliefs about being single vs. being in a relationship.
    * Question each belief. “Is being single *really* lonely, or have I just learned that from media?”
    * Replace the belief with something more aligned: “Relationships add value, but they aren’t oxygen.”
  * According to a 2021 Pew Research study, 44% of single adults say they’re not looking to date at all, and report higher levels of free time, personal growth, and satisfaction with friendships.

* **Detox from external validation**
  * The craving for a partner is often a craving for someone to tell you you’re enough.
  * Practice validation sources that don’t involve another person. Some ideas:
    * Learn a new skill and track your improvement.
    * Set micro goals and reward yourself, finish a book, hit a gym workout, cook something new.
    * Join a community (in person or online) that values what you *do*, not what you *are*.
  * Dr. Kristin Neff’s work on self-compassion shows that people who consistently affirm themselves experience lower anxiety and are less reliant on others for self-worth.

* **Reduce social comparison triggers**
  * The apps amplify your inner critic. The “happy couple” posts on IG? Curated. And half the time, they’re miserable behind the scenes.
  * What helps:
    * Use browser plugins to block triggering content.
    * Curate your feed to show more single, fulfilled creators.
    * Follow people building cool solo projects, not just couple aesthetics.
  * As Stanford researcher Dr. Anna Lembke shares in *Dopamine Nation*, constant passive exposure to idealized content hijacks our brain’s pleasure baseline, making real life feel dull. Cutting down resets your reward system.

* **Accept that desire will come and go, and that’s OK**
  * You won’t “cure” yourself of ever wanting a relationship. That’s not the goal.
  * The goal is to *relate to the desire differently*. Instead of urgency or shame, meet it with curiosity.
    * “Wow, I really want closeness today. What else could meet that need?”
    * “I feel drawn to someone. Is it attraction or is it loneliness?”
  * The goal is emotional agency. You’re in charge, not your craving.

* **Recommended books and resources to rewire your mindset**
  * *How to Be Single and Happy* by Dr. Jennifer Taitz: A CBT-based approach to joy without rushing into love.
  * *Attached* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller: Understand your attachment triggers so you stop chasing validation relationships.
  * *The Psychology of Romantic Love* by Nathaniel Branden: Breaks down the myths we attach to idealized love.
  * *Podcast*: On Purpose with Jay Shetty, esp. episodes on self-worth and love myths.
  * *YouTube*: The School of Life videos on being alone, fantasy relationships, and existential loneliness.

Once you realize that being single isn’t a *holding zone* but an actual path, everything shifts. You start making decisions for your actual self, not for your future partner. The craving doesn’t disappear overnight, but it softens. And eventually, you stop waiting to live until someone loves you back.

Turns out, that’s when you finally start feeling whole.",1,1762083272.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False
1omf0ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/bugoutbag/comments/1omf0ft/searching_aim_of_life/,searching aim of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

[](https://www.deviantart.com/awesomegamedude10/art/Thomas-leaves-Sodor-through-the-Magic-Buffers-film-1029440446)



(The story takes place in the middle of Sodor’s Legend of the Lost Treasure, after Thomas catapults most of the dynamite into the cavern, where Rocky found the pirate ship that Thomas has discovered after crashing down there, days ago. Thomas had saves Ryan’s life, but Sir Topham Hatt believes that Thomas tried to hurt Ryan on purpose, and he wouldn’t even listen to him)



After the accident, Thomas slowly move back into the shed. He could still hear his controller's voice yelled him furiously in his smokebox.



Thomas: (shouted sadly) It’s not fair! I didn’t do anything wrong this time! I mean sure I didn't tell Ryan about the bad coal but I was just trying to make up for what I've done! I... I used to be Sir Topham Hatt's Number 1... but... but I guess after those three incidents, I... I am no longer. AND I HAD ENOUGH!!!!



Thomas began to cry. He felt that his life was completely ruined. He remembered the time when he found Great Waterton and meet Stanley, when he felt that he was ruining his life and thought that nobody wanted him anymore. He even remember the time at the Blue Mountain Quarry, when he tried to tell the Narrow Gauge engines the truth about Luke but they they wouldn't listen either and thought he let them down. Now he felt like they were happening again, but combined in a much horrible way. He thought that nobody trusted him or wanted him anymore.



At the end of the day, the diggers could not dig anymore without the dynamite and none of them were in a good mood to do it. So the engines and the Pack started to leave the construction site. They felt very sorry for Thomas, including Ryan.  
  
Oliver (excavator): Come on everyone, let’s go home.



Ryan is puffing back to his shed too. He is slowly passing Thomas’ shed. Then, Thomas began to cry.  
  
Thomas: (sobbing)  
  
Ryan stopped when he heard Thomas crying, he felt worse.  
  
Ryan: (sadly) Oh Thomas, I’m so sorry.  
  
Then Ryan continued to puff to his shed.  
  
At the Sodor Construction Company Yard, Jack, Alfie and Oliver have been talking about Thomas getting in trouble just because of the dynamite.  
  
Jack: (sighs sadly) Poor Thomas.  
  
Alfie: I can’t believe he got punished for nothing.  
  
Oliver: Yeah, Thomas didn’t do anything wrong, he saved us from the dynamite. It’s totally unfair. What did Sir Topham Hatt think Thomas did?  
  
Jack: I don’t know, got rid of the dynamite for nothing?  
  
Alfie: Maybe.  
  
Oliver: Well guys let’s get some sleep. Good night.  
  
Jack and Alfie: Good night, Oliver.  
  
They felt very bad for Thomas. And so does Marion who also temporarily staying near the construction site.  
  
Marion: Man it’s so unfair to Thomas. He didn’t deserve to be punished, what he did was heroic.



Ryan: Oh Thomas. I'm so sorry.



Thomas: Just leave me alone Ryan.



Ryan: Okay. (puffs away)



Marion: Thomas, if you want you can ask the mini magical engines to reverse time and make your incidents never happen. (Puffs away)



Thomas: That doesn't work like that Marion and al- Wait an minute magic? Magic.



Just then Diesel, Splatter, and Dodge came by with more supplies for the construction site.



Diesel: Well well well. If it isn't the blue naughty troublesome tank engine himself.



Ryan: Can we not upset him?



Diesel: Come on Ryan. What he did was bad, he completely should be sold for scrap! Sir Topham Hatt will make sure of that!



Ryan: No Diesel! I know what really happen. He didn't do anything wrong!



Diesel: Nonsense Ryan!



(While Ryan and Diesel were arguing, Splatter and Dodge were talking to Thomas)



Splatter: Hey Thomas?



Dodge: What's wrong?



Thomas: (Sign) Sir Topham Hatt just won't let me explain the whole story. He's been jumping to conclusions about me for 3 days now. I guess I'm not longer number 1 anymore.



Splatter: If that's what you think...



Dodge: We give you two choices.



Thomas: What are they?



Dodge: You can stay here and try to do something good only to be yelled at and tortured by Sir Topham Hatt. Or...



Splatter: You'll have to leave Sodor. Make your decision.



Thomas sigh and close his eyes tightly think about the bad and good stuff he did, but he made the choice he never done before.



Thomas: I'm leaving Sodor.



Ryan: WHAT?!



Thomas: If Sir Topham Hatt won’t listen to me anymore, … then I… I…. (sobs) I DON’T WANT TO WORK ON THIS RAILWAY ANYMORE!!



Diesel: Woah!



Splatter: Come down Thomas. Perhaps you need to find another engine to become the new number one.



Dodge: And get cleaned and repainted to your original livery with your original number.



Thomas: Well I once knew that there was a coffeepot that use to be the number 1. Maybe I'll find him.



Splatter: Well there are more old engines on Edward's Branchline and on the Kirk Ronan Brancline if you want to look for them.



Thomas Okay.



Soon Diesel, Splatter, and Dodge left to the Dieselworks.



When nighttime came, Thomas puffed out of his shed leaving a message for Sir Topham Hatt to read when he comes and headed to Arlesburgh Junction where he saw a old yellow Narrow Gauge engine named Proteus.



Mike: May you please take him to the Steamworks please Thomas?



Thomas: Sure Mike.



Soon Thomas headed to an overgrown siding on his branchline as he heard a voice. Soon his crew cut down the trees and branches and then...



Thomas: Oh You're the coffee pot engine I replaced years ago. But you were on a siding near Ffarqhaur Station last time I saw you.



The Coffeepot Engine: I was shunted here there and everywhere before everyone finally forgot about me.



Thomas: I'm sorry I forgot you. Uh?



The Coffeepot engine: Glynn. My name's Glynn and you're Thomas aren't you? How were you doing on my old branchline?



Thomas: Well I was doing very well until Sir Topham Hatt sent me to the construction stie of the new branchline for causing a crash at Knapford Station, no thanks to Gordon. Then I ended up falling into a hole where I found that pirate ship. But Sir Topham Hatt wouldn’t let me explain and gave the credit to Rocky instead. But the worst part happened today. I saved Ryan and the whole construction site from blowing up and…

 

Glynn: Let me guess, this Sir Topham Hatt didn’t recognize your actions as heroic and had you wrongfully punished again?

 

Thomas: Why, yes!



Glynn: That's awful and you really have been through a lot Thomas.



Thomas I know which is why I'm taking you and some other old engines I can find to the Steamworks to be restored.



Glynn: Oh if that's what you wish. Okay then Thomas.



Soon Thomas went to Edward's Branch line and found the W&S engines (Colin, Lily and Adam) and onto the Kirk Ronan Branch line and found S&M engines (Neil, Clive and Matthew). Soon he took all of them as well as Glynn and to Proteus to the steamworks.



Victor: Thomas, hello my friend, isn’t it kinda late for you to be here?  
  
Thomas: Yes, Victor.  
  
Victor: Ok, then what can I do for you tonight?



Thomas: I brought some old engines to be restored.



???: So did we.



The voices came from Boco, Bear, Jinty, and Pug who brought in some rusty engines which are 4 E2s, 3 GWR 5700 Class, 3 B12, a B17, 2 Robinson Atlantics which are GCR Class 8B/LNER Class C4s and a GCR Class 8K 2-8-0 which came from the Mainland as they were saved from scrap.



Victor: Interesting we'll work on them tomorrow which will be a busy day.



Kevin: But what about you Thomas?



Thomas: Well, I was wondering if you can clean me and give me my original livery back.  
  
Victor: Your original livery?  
  
Thomas: Yes. Is that ok?  
  
Victor: Well, uh… sure.  
  
Thomas: Thanks, Victor.  
  
Victor: No problem, my friend. By the way, what does your original livery look like?  
  
Thomas: Well, when I first came to Sodor, I was painted tealish green, my previous number is 70, which is on the sides of my bunker, and the letters LBSC on the sides of my tank, it stands for London Brighton and South Coast Railway.  
  
Victor: Got it.  
  
Then after Thomas got cleaned, started getting repainted. First, the painters scraped off Thomas’ Sodor livery. Next, he was being painted tealish green. And finally, he got his previous number and letters of his former railway back.  
  
Thomas: Thanks again, Victor.  
  
Victor: You’re welcome, my friend. Well, while you’re waiting for the paint to dry, why do you want your original livery back anyway?



Thomas: Well you see, I don't feel like Sodor's number 1 anymore.



Victor, Kevin, Boco, Bear, Jinty, and Pug: Kevin: How come?  
  
Then, Thomas told them what happened at the construction site earlier, when the dynamite was accidentally lit, and saved everyone there, and how Sir Topham Hatt had treated him after it happened.  
  
Victor, Kevin, Boco, Bear, Jinty, and Pug were shocked, they cannot believe what Thomas had just been through.  
  
Victor: How awful. I can’t believe Sir Topham Hatt did that to you.  
  
Kevin: We’re really sorry that just happened to you, Thomas. That must be totally unfair, mostly when you did something heroic.  
  
Thomas: Thank you, Kevin. After what just happened to me, I had decided to do something I had never thought of my whole life.  
  
Victor: And what’s that?



Thomas: Leave Sodor and go some place to do something I never done and I won't come back until I done it.



Victor: Okay Thomas good luck.



Thomas had left the Steamworks. He decided to ask Billy and Dennis to do his work at the new branch line construction site and later he went to Tidmouth Sheds to say goodbye some of the engines.



Thomas got closer to the sheds the engines were already asleep.



Thomas: (Whispers) Pss. Edward. Percy.



Just then Edward and Percy woke up.



Percy: (Whispers) Yes Thomas?



Edward: (Whispers) What is it Thomas?



Thomas: Well if it's okay with you, I guess this might be goodbye.



Edward: (Whispers) Where are you going?



Thomas: To the Magic Railroad. But first I am going to do some shunting a Knapford.



Percy: (Whispers) Can we come too?



Thomas: Sure, if you want.



So they went off with the others still asleep, but Emily woke and saw Thomas, Edward, and Percy moving out of the sheds.



Emily: (Thinking) What's he up to now?



Emily began to move as well.



It was 9:00 pm when Thomas, Edward, and Percy went to do some shunting in Knapford Yard when Emily came along and brought Molly and Rosie along with her too. They shunt the trucks and coaches from one place to another and arrange all the trains in the platforms so that the others did not have to work in the morning. After they finished, Thomas decided to tour his favorite places in Sodor. He decided to start from the construction site of the new branch line, he then passed Arlesburgh, Tidmouth, Ffarquhar, Farmer Trotter’s farm, Farmer McColl’s farm, Brendam Docks, Kirk Ronan, Kellsthorpe Road, Callan Castle, Bluff’s Cove, Crovan’s Gate, The Wharf, Great Waterton, Tidmouth Town Square, Misty Island, The Search and Rescue Center, Blue Mountain Quarry, Ulfstead Castle, The Viaduct, Vicarstown, Black Loch, Henry’s Tunnel and Gordon’s Hill. They had very good and bad memories of all those places he has just traveled. After reaching the top, Thomas blew his whistle and said sadly...



Thomas: Good bye, North Western Railway.



Soon Thomas silently took Annie and Clarabell along with three trucks, two vans, and a brake van (two trucks full of coal, the other truck and two vans full of his favoritie things and new parts incase any of them brake down). When they went off The Main line & onto The Kirk Ronan branch line, Thomas began to sing.



Thomas: (Singing) *I'll huff and chuff all through the night,*

*Till I'm far away and free,*

*and when my steam runs out, I'll know,*

*That no one will find me.*

*But things are not the same as before,*

*Mistakes I make no one can ignore.*

*I keep my paintwork looking fine,*

*I try so hard to be on time,*

*but I'm not a useful engine anymore.*

*I'm not a useful engine anymore.*



Soon they were on an old siding and were nearing an old set of buffers that Thomas recognized before as a tumbleweed started talking and passing by.



The Tumbleweed: Howdy Partner! What's with the long face and who are the others with ya?



Thomas: Well, here goes nothing.



And so they went through the buffers & they found themselves on a strange looking railway. It has green fields, surrounded my mountains & shavings of magic.



Thomas: Goodbye Sodor.



Edward, Percy, Emily, Molly, and Rosie felt sorry for him as they followed him on the Magic Railroad.",1,1762083002.0,thomasthetankengine,1,0.67,False

I’m 34, based in Pune, originally from the North. I work in the financial sector.

I’m pretty active — gym is part of my routine, and I enjoy trekking and hiking whenever I get the chance. I’m usually the guy who plans a beach trip just to reset. Mountains are great too, but beaches win when I need to breathe.

I’d call myself an ambivert — I enjoy my own space and can disappear into a book or a game, but I also like travelling, exploring new places, and the occasional debate about football tactics over coffee. I don’t drink or smoke, but it’s fine if you do (as long as it’s not over the top).

I live alone and plan to continue that way for the foreseeable future, so I’d prefer someone who’s also comfortable with an independent setup.

I’ve done plenty of solo trips and loved them, but it would be nice to share that happiness and experience with someone like-minded now. I’m not the party type — more into long walks, movie or book discussions, casual games like badminton or pickleball, or sometimes just sleeping through a lazy day to reset.

I’m looking for someone grounded yet opinionated — a feminist who speaks her mind, takes care of herself mentally and physically, and values mutual respect and emotional balance. Ideally, someone who’s also childfree by choice and interested in a long-term, peaceful partnership.

Not chasing perfection — just looking for genuine connection, shared values, and sanity.
If any of this sounds familiar to your mindset, happy to chat and see if we get along.

There are no more battle missions, story missions, chaos explorations or anything left for me to do. The growth guide is stuck at ""do 12 memory fragment simulations"" which is dreadful, since you don't start getting decent equipment until you promote to level 40, it feels immensely wasteful and it feels more efficient to gather combatant materials.

If I just stick to the dailies and what I can do without spending any aether items or refreshing with crystals: 1200 (60 aether for 3 simulations) * 5 = 6000

Then 1500 daily xp from the dailies. That amounts to 7500. Not even a full level at this point. Just doing this strictly and nothing else it's going to take at least an entire week to get to level 40, and I want to start doing the good chaos runs. Knowing that after level 40 you unlock runs with more rewards epiphanies and memory expansion makes it not worth farming regular runs.

So two questions: first, do the weekly bosses grant more xp when you defeat them, or is the xp/aether ratio flat across all simulations?

Second, does anyone know the xp requiered to level up across levels? I haven't found any wikis or anything. I read somewhere that you can refresh 60 aether 8 times a day using up to 750 crystals I believe. That would be 9600 flat extra xp just by using crystals (not any stored coffees or tears), but I'd like to know what to expect regarding how much you need to invest to unlock the rest of the content.

What’s been surprising is how much it changes my mindset just to see the numbers go down in real time. Writing it out makes it tangible. Before, I’d spend mindlessly, dip into savings, or swipe the credit card and promise I’d “fix it later.” You know that cycle.

TL;DR: Don't waste your time or money on this soulless, expensive festival.

Been seeing a lot of posts about this festival on this sub so thought I’d share my experience at C2C in Turin this year for other people’s future reference (which I wish I had before going).

For context, I’ve been raised on partying in The Netherlands and been clubbing and going to festivals for the past 15 years. I’ve been to multiple clubs in Berlin such as Berghain, Renate, Visionare, Golden Gate and in Holland I’ve been to De School (when it was open), festivals like Dekmantel and Draaimolen, and I go to Waking Life in Portugal every year, arguably the best festival in the world. Also been to other top clubs and festivals across Europe.

C2C has got to the THE WORST festival I’ve been to for a number of reasons:

- Venue is way too big and has zero character or soul. It’s just a gigantic black hall with ZERO spots to chill or sit down (only outside in the cold)

- Security and staff everywhere, police and dogs at the entrance. Just creates a bad vibe where you feel you’re being watched and they want to catch you having too much fun. I'm all for safety but it was a bit much tbh

- Though the line-up is insane on paper (which is why I went) the programming is random and makes no sense as a progression through the night. There’s no logical build-up to dancing and it’s just a collection of short touch and go sets. They had for ex XII & Sabla (techno) play before this random Peruvian electronic folk music band Los Thuthanaka. Makes zero sense.

- Horrible crowd. Bunch of yappers that don’t dance at all and stick to their clique. I love Italy and Italians, so not sure if this is more of a Turin or Piedmonte thing

- Everything is EXPENSIVE inside. Mid drinks and food. 5 euros for coat check.  I don't mind paying good money for something great, but this just felt like pure highway robbery of a captive audience.

- Following from the previous, you get bombarded with advertising on gigantic screens. Of course we all lament the commercialization of counterculture, but – call me crazy – I don't want to constantly see prominent in-your-face IQOS, coffee, car, clothing or alcohol advertisements everywhere when I'm out partying

- Last but not least, there are guys throughout the venue selling expensive and FAKE party supplies! 15 euros for pressed chalk and 60 euros for some random powder that did jack shit. Netherlands spoiled me with high quality stuff and generally everything is diluted elsewhere, but I’ve never been straight up SCAMMED lol. If you want to party here make sure you get from a trusted local friend.

Silver linings:
- Great soundsystem (Funktion-One) and lighting
- Nicolas Jaar and Floating Points were amazing as always
- Topping up wristband with credits through the app is handy
- A lot of medics walking around to help out if you go bad, feels very safe
- I slept like a baby bc of the fake stuff lol
- Turin is a great city, with amazing, affordable food. Had some top 10 meals of my life here!

If I could give this festival negative stars, I would. 

So this is a fair warning to discerning partygoers who have high standards: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY THIS FESTIVAL.",20,1762082601.0,TheOverload,11,0.88,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

We're a couple with a young toddler. The buffet restaurant has a reasonably large outdoor seating area which we have used all week without issue. 

This morning we went outside for breakfast and there was one free table with two coffees on it. Often people leave, and the staff haven't gotten to clear the table yet, so we assumed it was free. I went inside and got a high chair for the baby and as we were sitting him into it at the table a middle aged lady came and said ""That's our table, didn't you see the coffee we left on it?"". I replied ""You can't reserve a table with a cup of coffee"" and my wife added that we thought they were left by someone who had finished. I said that she should just sit at the table and take turns to go to the buffet if she wanted to keep it. She replied that we have to do that because of the baby, but they don't. 
She offered to share the table and I said ok, how many of you are there. ""Three"" she replied, so I said well that won't work at a table for four. 

Meanwhile, a table beside us became free and we moved to that. Her family arrived, husband and teenage son. She said ""why didn't you just take that clearly empty table in the first place?"" to which I replied that it was occupied until moments ago. 

That was the end of it, or so I thought until 10 minutes later when the family were leaving and the husband stopped as he passed us to say ""Enjoy your holiday, you arrogant bastard"".
I should have held my tongue but I couldn't help but calmly saying ""you're a scumbag"". 

So, AITAH here? It bugs me when people try to claim a table like that and it hasn't been an issue all week. It's similar to reserving a sun lounger with a towel. I think the husband was way out of line to swear at me.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1omeo9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1omeo9r/aita_for_wearing_bikini_bottoms_in_my_costume/,AITA for wearing bikini bottoms in my costume,"Hey guys, me F(20) and my bf M(21) are currently not talking to each other. On Halloween I went to a party with my friends and he stayed home because he had work in the morning. Long story short I made a tik tok in my costume and he saw it and then got rlllllyyy upset. 

I was dressed as poison ivy, my costume consisted of a green corset with green bikini bottoms and tights with heels. He was upset because of the bikini bottoms. He said it was disrespectful to go out like that when I have a bf. 

We’ve been together for 4 years in December so the way he reacted was completely immature to me, while he was getting upset at me I was getting upset back and I ended up saying “you say your not insecure but look at how your acting” and he didn’t like me calling him insecure, mind you he is. I’m not allowed to have guy friends, he gets upset when I have celebrity crushes (jokingly but deep down he’s serious) I just know it’s better to not say anything about men in general cus he takes it a certain way. 

I’ve given him no reason to believe that I would be unloyal. I’ve given him my all for the past 4 years,I don’t even follow any men on social media. I’ve gotten up at 3 in the morning just to make him coffee before work. I honestly make so many sacrifices for him.

For him to just text me and say I want attention when god forbid I just wanna feel good on Halloween. Our argument escalated and after I called him insecure he said “ok then I’m going to go to a strip club since your not insecure” so I replied “see how fast you loose your girl” I don’t know how everyone else feels about strip clubs, and I’m all for the hustle but to me going to a strip club is beyond disrespectful when your in a relationship. 

After that he said something along the lines of “you dress like that I might as well go look at other sluts” so obviously that’s crazy. After that he didn’t text back but I sent him a long paragraph and I basically told him to reflect. I mentioned how I’ve never been unloyal or have given him a reason to think I’ve been. I wear bikini bottoms and it’s never been an issue like if anything the tights were better lol. 

He then turned off his location and we haven’t talked at all, he did send me one text saying “hey, I’m going to want to talk in person but I want a couple days away” I’m not itching to talk to him. He was beyond disrespectful to me and I haven’t felt good about us. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to leave him, he’s all I’ve known for 4 years. I know I’m young and that I’ll be ok if I leave. I just don’t know If I want to do that, we’ve had our lives so intertwined. 

Right now I’m just waiting to see what he’ll say when we talk, it can literally go any way.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Manchester City vs. Bournemouth: A Tale of Two Cities (and One Very Confident Spread)**

The Premier League’s most anticipated clash of the week isn’t between a certain “invincibles” and a team named after a seaside town—it’s between Manchester City, the Etihad’s version of a Marvel superhero, and Bournemouth, who’ve somehow managed to be second in the league while playing soccer with the enthusiasm of a tax auditor. Let’s break this down with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s had one too many cups of tea.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Your Grandma Knows City Will Win

The bookmakers are throwing a pity party for Bournemouth, offering **+600 odds** (decimal \~6.0) for the Cherries to pull off an upset. That translates to a **16.7% implied probability**, or roughly the chance of Erling Haaland deciding to take a coffee break mid-game. Meanwhile, Manchester City is priced at **-300 odds** (decimal \~1.46), implying a **68.5% chance to win**. For context, that’s about the same odds as a cat successfully navigating a laser pointer without knocking over a priceless vase.

The spread? City is favored by **1.5 goals**, which means they’ll need to win by two to satisfy the gamblers who’ve bet on their “-1.5” line. Given their recent 5-1 thrashing of Burnley (a team that still hasn’t figured out the concept of “defense”), this feels like asking a cheetah to outrun a sloth—*with a head start*.

---

### Team News: Rodri’s Absence and Bournemouth’s “Unbeaten” Magic

Manchester City’s only blemish? Nico Gonzalez, a midfielder who looks like he’s auditioning for a role in *The Office*, is filling in for the injured Rodri. Let’s hope he doesn’t spend the game side-eyeing the ball like it owes him rent. Defensively, Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias are still the league’s version of a locked door—unless Bournemouth’s Eli Kroupi decides to become the first human to score on Haaland’s back *and* win a Nobel Prize for physics.

Bournemouth, meanwhile, are riding a five-game unbeaten streak, which is impressive if you ignore the fact that two of those g

We were trying to come up with date ideas, and my friends all came up with lots of strange things that I never thought could be appropriate for a date. (Mine were all the classic coffee, dinner, and movie stuff).

But surprisingly, many of my friends actually thought those weird things sounded kinda fun and said they’d try them.

So I went on to try one of the things, which was Axe throwing (I know this one is not that weird but it’s something new to me). Kinda doubted it at first, but turned out my gf and I both loved it, so we planned to try all the different things on our next dates.

It made me realize people can have the wildest and most creative date ideas.

And scrolling through the internet (especially Reddit), I came across so many weird and surprisingly wholesome date ideas.

So I decided to collect them all and build a little community board where people can discover and share their own unconventional and fun date ideas. 

It’s been so much fun to see what people come up with. Some ideas are romantic, some are definitely weird (I might try them lmao)

For anyone curious, the website is called [Spice Up](https://spice-up.pages.dev/). It’s a list of fun and unusual date ideas. (It’s totally free, it’s just a place to discover and share date ideas).

I’m a 32-year-old guy from Israel, married with two kids, and I’m looking for long-term online penpals. I really enjoy deep, thoughtful “long letter” style exchanges — the kind that slowly grow into real friendships.

I’m not into fast-paced chatting; I prefer writing once every week or two, after we’ve already built a meaningful rhythm of conversation.

What I value most is the authentic connection that comes from sharing our day-to-day life and ideas. I’m not looking for small talk — I love when people go on tangents, explore ideas, and just nerd out about what they care about.

A few of my interests:

📚 Reading — mostly fantasy, but I’m open to anything that’s well-written

🎬 Popular TV shows

🍳 Culinary adventures — my wife runs a bakery, and we both love cooking. I’m into cocktails, coffee brewing, and smoking meats

✍️ Creative writing

🌍 Traveling — I try to take short trips every few months to explore new countries

🧠 Self-development, psychology, and philosophy — they all somehow connect in my mind

💻 Technology — I’m a programmer by profession


Not interested in politics, but I’ll mention that I’m from Israel — just in case it matters for anyone.

Also, once a real connection forms, I’m totally open to exchanging small physical packages or handwritten letters alongside our online chats — I think it adds a personal touch that’s hard to replace. ✉️🎁

The theme is quite similar to Michiko Aoyama’s “What you are looking for is in the library” and “The healing hippo of Hinode park” and I found the book cozy and something that doesn’t require you to think a lot or put your brain to work and look for “clues” or “inferences”. A book that you could enjoy with a hot cup of coffee while a soft and mellow tune plays.I really enjoy the character transformations too, Takaji goes from being an old and distant man struggling to adapt to the retired life to a happier man who is closer with his family and Kosei goes from berating his mom for having childish hobbies to accepting and supporting her interests, no matter her age. But the most satisfying part of the book was how their transformation journey was authentic and there were no big shocks or twists or over the night changes. Yes, some parts do seem a bit over the top but in the end, we must remind ourselves that this is fiction and not everything has to be 100% accurate!

They don't want you know where they live. One guy even refused to give me his address although we were literally at his place. Because, and I quote ""I have stalkers."" 

They're more likely to fear getting women pregnant. Millennial men by far seem like the type to suggest an abortion. Both parties could be on birth control and have negative STD tests, and millennial men will still worry about getting you pregnant.

They're also afraid of you knowing their income. I get it that they're afraid of attracting gold diggers. But not all women are gold diggers, and if anything this further pushes away those quality women that expect basic trust and connection from a man. They're afraid to show any signs of financial generosity, and reassurance to the woman that he can (at least help) provide. They bug out over having to buy you a drink or a coffee.

Is this just me? Or ladies what's been your experience? What's your opinion overall on this subject?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I've been vegetarian most of my life, only because the texture of meat and the smell of fish and eggs repulses me, but the last couple months I've had to go full vegan  bc now bc all animal products and anything with them in it disgust me. I can't drink ensures or nutrition shakes bc there's dairy in them. I used to drink those when I couldn't eat and loved them. I can't eat solid foods at all.

Sometimes you can have a date that goes 'good' on paper, laughing, spending more time than you anticipated, physical intimacy etc, but after you part ways, there is a 'negative' or 'anxious' feeling in the pit of your stomach, like you feel something is off, even if you can't place why.

On the flip-side, sometimes you can have a date that leaves you with an elated, happy, confident feeling, even if nothing particularly telling happened on the date itself. May have just been a coffee over an hour and introductions. 

I find that this often is really predictive of whether the person will want to see you again. If you leave feeling happy they will, if not, they won't. 

I'm wondering what this is? Is it just your body picking up subconscious signals that you aren't necessarily aware of mentally? Does anyone else experience this? 

Do you find it's generally accurate? If you leave a date with a bad gut feeling, are you ever surprised to see the other person responsive and looking forward to seeing you again? Or the flipside, if you leave feeling good and confident, are you ever surprised to see the other person uninterested?

with that being said ill try to keep this short. i have a friend whom i met through my boyfriend. we are not close or tight like that at all. i’ve seen him maybe less than 10 times. i used to work my bf’s restaurant and he would come sometimes and we would just have a quick chat. at the time he was in a relationship and everytime he came to eat he was just being very overfriendly to point where idk if that’s just his personality or there’s other intention.

fast forward to present time. i follow him on instagram and often post my kitty cat on my story and he always like the stories w my cat so i decided to add him to my close friends bc thats all i ever post lol. so yeah in my close friend he would always like the post or just leave a message about my cat. 

my boyfriend and i threw a halloween party and my bf invited him and he brought a girl he was talking to. at the party i had a lot of halloween decorations and there was a wall where i had printed all my friends photos with the title “wanted for” and he was on it since my bf made it. after that night he posted his “wanted poster” on his story and posted mine?? and the title for mine was “wanted for saying she’ll quit nicotine but never did”. he posted that and tagged me. the reason i am overreacting is that he knew everyone at the party bc they all went to hs together, yet he didn’t post their wanted posters but only mine?? so that entire night his instagram story was literally just a pic of his and mine’s poster so i thought it was kinda strange since we not that close.

i also forgot to mention that before that halloween party i had posted in my close friend that i now have a new job at a coffee shop and he slid down my story and ask whats my schedule like so he can come by and get a cup of coffee (fyi i never told him my schedule lol) then a couple days later he made a gc on instagram and added my bf and i and he sent a message that says “what days does *my name* work so i can come and be disruptive” and my bf just replied w lmao and i just liked his message. with then leads me to think why did he just do that out of no where, was he like thinking about me or just happen to think about the coffee shop ?? YALL IDKKKK

so with all that context do yall think im tripping? genuinely don’t know if he’s just friendly or weird lol (people that went to hs w him whom are also my friend said he was a weirdo) 

sorry yall i said long story short then proceeds to tell the whole story so pls lmk what yall think!!!

I call it **Keto Cinnamon Pumpkin Pancakes with Butter**.  
Here’s what makes it different:

**What I loved**

* The warm spice of pumpkin + cinnamon gives it that cozy “fall breakfast” feel (but yes, you can make it any time).
* It uses almond &/or coconut flour so it stays under the carb radar (many keto pancake recipes do exactly this). 
* Slathered with butter (because yes, comfort) and optionally sugar-free syrup — without wrecking your low-carb goals.

**How I used it**  
I whipped them up in about 15–20 minutes. While they cooked I prepared a simple topping: butter + a drizzle of sugar-free maple syrup. I served it with bacon (for protein) and a bulletproof coffee (for fun). The result? Felt like cheating brunch but kept my carbs in check.

**Freebie for you**  
If you want, I mapped out the **full recipe, ingredient list, macros & printable shopping list** right here: [Keto Cinnamon Pumpkin Pancakes with Butter](https://keto-recipes25.com/keto-cinnamon-pumpkin-pancakes-with-butter/) — no paywall, just good food.

**TL;DR**

Yeah, it’s slightly on the expensive side, but it’s the only one that hasn’t caused any bloating. Nutrabox messed up my stomach — I’m guessing it’s the sucralose since it even had a bit of a laxative effect.

1ome3j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ac_newhorizons/comments/1ome3j3/new_horizons_is_more_alike_animal_crossing_than/,New Horizons is more alike Animal Crossing than people care to admit. NL has always been the odd one of the group.,"Since the announcement of the 3.0 Update (but even before that, I've noticed more and more people pushing claims that New Horizons is less sim-like or its gameplay is less ""Animal Crossing"" than before. My view is that New Horizons is actually more like Animal Crossing than people care to admit, while New Leaf was kind of the exception (and a justified one, as well).)

I'll start of by saying that I do agree with many of the criticisms and points made over New Horizons: I do agree that design/decorating are at the core of this game ; that it's shameful that we don't have as many returning special NPCs like we would like (especially those that make little sense for them not to add, like Gracie or Blanca ; I absolutely think that not having multiplayer mini-games is a missed opportunity (and a missed business opportunity for them, as well) and I do terribly miss the Nook's upgrades.)

Having said all of that, I do think that many of the criticism I see thrown around is pretty unfair:

**Sense/element of progression**  
This is perhaps one of the biggest points I see thrown around. Unlike what people say, New Horizons does have a sense of progression: quite literally you start off in a deserted island and build off from there (with a few ""tasks"" handed to you by Tom Nook himself. Slowly, your island will start developing, opening itself for more buildings and stores. Timmy and Tommy will leave the tent and start off with Nook's Cranny ; Mabel will visit and propose starting the Able's Sisters Shop ; You will eventually find Blather's tent and he'll start off the museum (the first part) ; eventually you'll also find Brewster on an island and he'll open The Roost ; Isabelle will arrive soon with the renewal of the Resident Services building ; you will eventually meet Harvey on your island to invite you to his ; and this will all (eventually) wrap up with K.K.'s concert. In addition to this, the game does unlock quite a few features as you progress: the island builder, the online catalogue, customizing your home (exterior), and if you have the DLC -- you will eventually also unlock more features for your house. There's also ""smaller"" things you unlock, like the specific items you can get through the aerobics, for example. In addition, NH introduced the whole ""Nooks Miles"" thing, which can actually push players to accomplish certain tasks. I think the biggest issue of the game is, perhaps, that ""progression"" seems more predominant on the early stages of the game. Whereas in New Leaf, progression actually takes more time.)

However, if you look at past games (prior to NL, you'd know that) **there really isn't anything you can progress there** (with the exception of Nook's stores. Otherwise, the game is pretty much the same forever.)

**Online multiplayer**  
Online multiplayer is also a point that I see brought up very often here. I also really liked the mini-games on Tortimer Island in New Leaf and, as I said, I think it's a missed opportunity that they didn't bring them back here. **However, online multiplayer in NH is nothing different to previous (online installments.)** Back then in WW and CF, there really wasn't much else to do (other than play hide and seek in the museum, lol. If anything, I think NH has allowed for players to create more games of their own. I also think that, the fact that islands are very different to each other, actually encourages more people to visit each other than if they were to do so now a days with WW or CF.)

I also think that Slumber Party (introduced in 3.0 is a step in the right direction. It really look fun but not just from a decorative perspective -- I can only imagine the types of mini games and courses people will create from there.)

**Special NPCs and events**  
As I've said, it's quite shameful that Nintendo didn't bring back all of the special NPCs from previous games. I think quite a few of them would've made sense if they had been brought back (Blanca for April's Fools or Gracie. However, I think people don't realize that New Horizons currently has more special NPC's than GCN, WW and CF.)

\*\*- Gamecube Animal crossing had 33 special NPCs\*\*.  
**- Animal Crossing: Wild World had 34 special NPCs.**  
**- Animal Crossing: City Folk had 48 special NPCs.**  
**- Animal Crossing: New Leaf had 61 special NPCs.**  
**- Animal Crossing: New Horizons has 50 special NPCs (currently with 3.0 ; prior to 3.0 it had 47 - DLC included in both counts, without DLC it has 44.)**

So yes, I'm also sad about the lack of returning special NPCs (and I can totally understand people being upset as well by this ; especially when I feel like some NPCs were unfairly replaced by items: like the postcard stand or the QR Design Code stand. However, it literally has the most special NPCs compared to the older series. I think there's also quite a few positives from the way these new NPCs have been approached: I absolutely loved learning more about Cyrus and Reese through their wedding anniversary event ; Unlike New Leaf, Blathers will actually tell you more about insects/fish/critters (and his fear of insects is back) ; I thought it was pretty sweet that Brewster shows interest in Gyroids again (though I find it a shame that we can't give him gyroids, like in WW and CF). I also really like that Celeste's, unlike NL, is once again linked to stars and the sky (having falling stars while Celeste is on your island ; her giving your recipes for constellation-based furniture or space related, too, and wands!). C.J. and Flick being there not just for tournaments but also to give you models of insects and fish! Joan being in the hospital (lol) and giving you tnps every Monday! D.J. K.K. holding big raves at the HHP island every Sunday!)

This is also not to mention that we can bring in and have coffee with all special NPCs and decorate their homes at HHP.

While it's definitely a matter of taste and preference, I definitely like the way New Horizons approaches events and festivities. I love seeing how our villagers are more involved in them than in previous games. I also found that in New Leaf, we had lots of festivities that were celebrated with a cardboard for pics. I love the way NH has introduced more ""simple"" but sweet events, like May Day, the Wedding Anniversary Event, Earth Day with Leif (shrubs and the Nook Mile events and International Museum Day with the stamps!)

As a reminder, **Wild World had no ""traditional"" holiday events like in most games.** There was no Bunny Day, Halloween, Turkey Day or Toy Day. I absolutely know that, if Wild World were to be released at that state now a days, it would've been torn to pieces. Anyone saying otherwise, is absolutely lying.

As a point of comparison, here are the number of holidays celebrated per game in the series (not necessarily linked to an event:)

**- Animal Crossing GCN had 27 holidays.**  
**- Animal Crossing WW had 14 holidays.**  
**- Animal Crossing CF had 23 holidays.**  
**- Animal Crossing New Leaf had 21 holidays.**  
**- Animal Crossing New Horizons: 19 holidays (this is not considering the celebratory international event items you get through Nook's Shopping Catalogue, which are much more. I also didn't consider ""seasonal events"" like cherry blossoms/mushroom season, etc.)**

**Returning features (and return to form)**  
I feel like these aren't talked to enough, but New Horizons actually brought back so many features from the older games in the series. New Horizons was able to bring back:

\- The ""up"" camera view like in Animal Crossing Gamecube.  
\- The ""dream like"" sequence of K.K. is similar to Animal Crossing Gamecube.  
\- K.K. playing outside and the sequence is very similar to Animal Crossing Gamecube.  
\- Wisp and Gulliver have roles very similar to Gamecube Animal Crossing.  
\- Message in a bottle from Wild World (though not quite exactly the same.)  
\- Morning Aerobics from Gamecube Animal Crossing.  
\- (Currently, with the 3.0 update Being able to play with older Nintendo consoles (though you do need an NSO account to do so).)  
\- Tiers on the map (like having up to three levels.)  
\- ""Islander"" villagers from Gamecube Animal Crossing.  
\- Cornimer from Wild World.

**Villagers personality and dialogue**  
Probably one of the most repeated points I see around here. Again, it's definitely a matter of taste and preference. I think NH's dialogue is actually pretty good, personally. I find that it can be pretty witty and I really enjoy going around talking to my villagers. NL's dialogue was very much centered on ""tasks"" (bring me this, do that, etc. There's a chunk of dialogue also related to ""did you know if you press the X button... did you know there are lockers in the station..."". You can check some of the differences (though it's not complete) in the transcripts) [here](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Cranky/New_Horizons_dialogue) (NH and) [here](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Guide:Cranky_dialogues_(New_Leaf)) (NL.)

Gamecube and Wild World had very great dialogue, too. Of course, there's the mean villagers part (which I adored, and the sense that they were progressively more friendly to you as they started to know more about you. But I also think that GCN dialogue was flawed at times. I think people may misremember, but it was very repetitive (so it cycled a lot) and a lot of it was also ""press this button to X... ; go here if you want to buy ..."".)

**Concluding thoughts**  
I see lots of people argue that Animal Crossing: New Horizons doesn't feel like Animal Crossing, but I think it would be more fair if people were to frame those comparisons with New Leaf (because they truly mean New Leaf when they compare it to Animal Crossing as a series as a whole. Additionally, I think you are still pretty much free to play NH however you want, but I do see that people generally rush through the game when the game's philosophy and ethos has always been about taking things slowly and one thing at a time. Even then, there's tons of people doing time travel, treasure islands, etc. There's nothing wrong with that. I go to islands from other hemispheres, too. But I think people should also think about what they are doing and how they are approaching the game as part of their criticisms.)

I also think the game needed to re-invent itself. I think there's a very little, niche community of players that still play older Animal Crossing games (myself included. But I'm 100% sure that the big majority of people would not have enjoyed Animal Crossing as much as they do now, because there was just not much to do on the older games. You did your dailys (which were a lot less back then) and that was pretty much it. GCN AC was pretty much a single-player game and it had lots of problems/hassles (like sending your fossils to the museum by mail, lol). I know lots of people would hate on those things today -- and villager interaction alone would not save them (because, as I said, while super creative and fun, they were also quite repetitive).)

City Folk is probably proof of this. It was a carbon-copy of Wild World (with exception of the ""city"" feature, which was pretty lackluster, in general. The game reviewed and sold horribly (to this day, it's the worst-rated game of the series and it's one of the games with the lowest sales, as well ; Happy Home Designer almost sold just as much as CF, lol). So I'm sure that the AC team needed to innovate -- and they did with New Leaf. New Leaf brought a much needed innovative approach to the franchise (which was on the verge of dying). It literally turned Animal Crossing from a niche series into a Nintendo top 5.)

I think New Horizons needed this new approach as well. I don't think the game would've survived as much with a carbon copy design of New Leaf. And the thing is, the game did bring a wave of new players (pdnmic aside that has helped the series grow even more.)",29,1762079928.0,ac_newhorizons,9,0.81,False

***It was October 28, 2028, when the world changed forever.***



***I remember that night vividly—gray clouds hanging low in the sky, suffocating everything below. The air was thick with a restless tension, the kind that makes your skin crawl for no particular reason. I had settled into my usual routine, brewing a late-night coffee as the TV flickered with its usual banal news chatter. But that night was different. That night, the screen started glitching, displaying a series of static frames before cutting to black. My heart sank a bit, thinking it was just some electrical glitch, but it wasn't.***



***Just as I reached for the remote to turn it off, a high-pitched whine pierced the air. The screen came alive again, but it was no longer the familiar, comforting faces of the news anchors. Instead, it was a military broadcast, black and white, with bold letters reading:***



***\*\*""EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM: IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED.""\*\****



***I stared at the screen, waiting for it to pass. For the first time, it didn't. A voice I didn’t recognize came on, a woman speaking with such a cold detachment that it sounded rehearsed.***



***\*""This is not a test. Hostile nations have engaged in a conflict of unprecedented scale. This is a global emergency.""\****



***The broadcast went on, saying that NATO and Russia, after decades of tension, had finally crossed the line. With alliances fractured and new powers emerging, a web of battles had erupted across Europe, Asia, and even parts of South America. Every major city was on high alert. Martial law was in effect. She listed major cities where bombings had already taken place—Paris, Berlin, New Delhi, Moscow. But what came next made my blood run cold.***



***\*""Biological and chemical weapons have been deployed,""\* she announced, her tone never wavering. \*""Stay indoors. Close all windows. Cover your mouth and nose if you must go outside. Symptoms of exposure include disorientation, auditory hallucinations, and in some cases, extreme aggression.""\****



***She repeated the instructions three times before the screen went black.***



***---***



***Days passed, then weeks. There was no power, no water, no government aid, no evacuation plans. We were alone, left to survive. Outside, the world was a wasteland. Those who had managed to survive in the immediate aftermath were scavenging, trying to avoid military drones that flew overhead day and night. They carried with them a terrifying, unmistakable hum, like a swarm of metallic bees. Some drones were programmed to capture footage, others to enforce curfews, and some… well, I didn't know what they were for, and I didn’t want to find out.***



***About a month in, something strange started happening.***



***At night, a low, static hum would drift from abandoned radios, speakers, and even old telephones. Those who dared to turn the dials swore they heard fragments of human speech—people talking in frantic, panicked whispers, sometimes laughing in ways that made their voices sound twisted, distorted, like a broken record playing in reverse.***



***It wasn’t long before stories started circulating. They said that if you listened to the static for too long, you’d start hearing things you shouldn’t—lost voices of family members calling out to you, warning you to leave, or begging you to stay. Sometimes, they’d tell you to \*look outside.\****



***Curiosity got the best of me one night. I tuned my battered old radio to a dead frequency, letting the static roll over me like a wave. At first, it was just noise. But soon, something strange happened.***



***\*“Please,”\* a soft voice came through, almost pleading. \*“You have to listen.”\****



***I froze, heart hammering in my chest. It was a woman’s voice, gentle yet filled with urgency.***



***\*“They know where you are. They know everything. Do not trust the broadcasts. Do not trust the military. They are not here to save you.”\****



***The voice faded, but the message burned in my mind. I turned the radio off, half hoping I’d imagined it. But there was no denying what I’d heard. It wasn’t static; it wasn’t interference. Someone, somewhere, was trying to warn us.***



***---***



***After that, I started noticing other things, unsettling things. People I’d known all my life seemed to… change. It was subtle at first—a glassy look in their eyes, a delayed reaction to simple questions. Then it became more obvious. They would stand still for hours, staring at nothing, muttering under their breath. Some would wander aimlessly, eyes glazed, as if in a trance. The worst were those who had taken to carving strange symbols into the walls of their homes, symbols I’d never seen before—spirals, eyes, hands. A language, maybe, or a message. They became known as “The Marked.”***



***Rumors spread about The Marked. They were agents of some higher power, some dark force released during the bombings. Others said they were experiments, victims of chemical exposure twisted into something… else. But one thing was clear: they weren’t human anymore.***



***One night, I heard tapping at my window. My heart sank as I cautiously pulled back the curtain. There, outside my window, was my neighbor—a quiet man named Harold who had kept to himself mostly. His face was pale, his eyes hollow, and his mouth… his mouth was pulled into a grotesque smile, wide and unsettling. His fingers were bleeding, nails torn from tapping on the glass so insistently.***



***“Come outside,” he said in a sing-song voice that sounded almost childish. “It’s safe now. Come outside.”***



***I backed away, heart pounding. He kept tapping, whispering to me over and over, “Come outside.”***



***When I refused, he grew silent, and I thought he’d finally left. But when I looked back, I saw him, standing still, watching my house from the street. He stayed there all night.***



***---***



***More weeks passed, and the broadcasts resumed. This time, they were different. It was a new voice—a man’s, deep and soothing. He spoke as if addressing children, his words slow and deliberate.***



***\*""You are safe. The worst has passed. It is time to come together, to rebuild.""\****



***But there was something in his tone, a certain emptiness that sent a chill down my spine. People who were still in hiding began to emerge, gathering in public places, like the broadcast voice had instructed. They were like sheep, drawn to the voice, hypnotized by it.***



***One night, the voice changed again. It was the same man, but now he sounded… unhinged. There was a wild, almost frantic edge to his words.***



***\*""The world as you knew it is gone. You belong to us now. Serve us, obey us, and you will live.""\****



***The next morning, those who had obeyed the broadcasts, the ones who went out, didn’t come back. The streets were littered with abandoned clothes, shoes, belongings. It was as if they had simply vanished, leaving only the remnants of who they’d once been.***



***---***



***By the end of winter, most people were either dead or “Marked.” I was part of a small group that had learned how to survive—avoiding the streets, hiding during the broadcasts, never speaking of what we’d seen outside. We shared stories around flickering candles at night, stories of people who’d gone mad, of shadows that seemed to move on their own, of creatures that prowled the empty streets after sundown.***



***One night, as we huddled together, a woman named Leah pulled a small, crumpled piece of paper from her pocket. It was a note she’d found in her brother’s coat after he’d disappeared. The handwriting was messy, the ink smudged, but we could make out a few words:***



***\*""They are not who they say they are. They are not from here.""\****



***She looked up, tears in her eyes, whispering, \*""What does it mean?""\****



***None of us knew. We didn’t want to know.***



***---***



***Now, it’s been a year since the war began, and it feels as though the world has slipped into some kind of nightmare. I’m the last one left of my group. The others vanished, one by one, each drawn by the broadcasts or by strange whispers in the night.***



***I’m writing this, hoping someone will find it, someone who can understand what happened here. Maybe there’s a place untouched by the horrors, a place where people still live as they once did, unaware of the madness that has gripped the world.***



***As I write, I hear footsteps outside my door. They’re slow, deliberate, drawing closer with each passing second. I know better than to open it, but my hands tremble as the handle begins to turn.***



***A voice whispers through the crack, soft and coaxing.***



***\*""Come outside.""\****



***The footsteps stop, and I feel a chill run through me. I don’t know if it’s night or day, I don’t know if help will ever come. All I know is that something—someone—is waiting for me just beyond that door.***



***And it won’t stop calling my name.***",2,1762079766.0,DrCreepensVault,0,1.0,False

I’m in Hyderabad for the next one week, and I don’t know anyone here yet, so I’m hoping to get some suggestions on things to do and places to check out.

I’d really appreciate recommendations for:

Underrated / offbeat places that locals love

Chill cafés, hangout spots, viewpoints

Food places that aren’t the typical tourist traps

Any interesting expos, events, hip-hop cyphers, open mics, or creative scenes happening this week

And if anyone’s down for a casual hangout/coffee, I’m open to that too

Comfy stuff, clean fits, easy to wear out for coffee or class.

* puffer jackets → warm and not too bulky
* tees & hoodies → solid quality, soft material
* sneakers → go with literally everything

Color palette ended up being a mix of black / white / beige / pink — unintentionally aesthetic lol.

1omdwlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1omdwlz/new_horizons_is_more_alike_animal_crossing_than/,New Horizons is more alike Animal Crossing than people care to admit. NL has always been the odd one of the group.,"Since the announcement of the 3.0 Update (but even before that, I've noticed more and more people pushing claims that New Horizons is less sim-like or its gameplay is less ""Animal Crossing"" than before. My view is that New Horizons is actually more like Animal Crossing than people care to admit, while New Leaf was kind of the exception (and a justified one, as well).)

I'll start of by saying that I do agree with many of the criticisms and points made over New Horizons: I do agree that design/decorating are at the core of this game ; that it's shameful that we don't have as many returning special NPCs like we would like (especially those that make little sense for them not to add, like Gracie or Blanca ; I absolutely think that not having multiplayer mini-games is a missed opportunity (and a missed business opportunity for them, as well) and I do terribly miss the Nook's upgrades.)

Having said all of that, I do think that many of the criticism I see thrown around is pretty unfair:

**Sense/element of progression**  
This is perhaps one of the biggest points I see thrown around. Unlike what people say, New Horizons does have a sense of progression: quite literally you start off in a deserted island and build off from there (with a few ""tasks"" handed to you by Tom Nook himself. Slowly, your island will start developing, opening itself for more buildings and stores. Timmy and Tommy will leave the tent and start off with Nook's Cranny ; Mabel will visit and propose starting the Able's Sisters Shop ; You will eventually find Blather's tent and he'll start off the museum (the first part) ; eventually you'll also find Brewster on an island and he'll open The Roost ; Isabelle will arrive soon with the renewal of the Resident Services building ; you will eventually meet Harvey on your island to invite you to his ;  and this will all (eventually) wrap up with K.K.'s concert. In addition to this, the game does unlock quite a few features as you progress: the island builder, the online catalogue, customizing your home (exterior), and if you have the DLC -- you will eventually also unlock more features for your house. There's also ""smaller"" things you unlock, like the specific items you can get through the aerobics, for example. In addition, NH introduced the whole ""Nooks Miles"" thing, which can actually push players to accomplish certain tasks. I think the biggest issue of the game is, perhaps, that ""progression"" seems more predominant on the early stages of the game. Whereas in New Leaf, progression actually takes more time.)

However, if you look at past games (prior to NL, you'd know that) **there really isn't anything you can progress there** (with the exception of Nook's stores. Otherwise, the game is pretty much the same forever.)

**Online multiplayer**  
Online multiplayer is also a point that I see brought up very often here. I also really liked the mini-games on Tortimer Island in New Leaf and, as I said, I think it's a missed opportunity that they didn't bring them back here. **However, online multiplayer in NH is nothing different to previous (online installments.)** Back then in WW and CF, there really wasn't much else to do (other than play hide and seek in the museum, lol. If anything, I think NH has allowed for players to create more games of their own. I also think that, the fact that islands are very different to each other, actually encourages more people to visit each other than if they were to do so now a days with WW or CF.)

I also think that Slumber Party (introduced in 3.0 is a step in the right direction. It really look fun but not just from a decorative perspective -- I can only imagine the types of mini games and courses people will create from there.)

**Special NPCs and events**  
As I've said, it's quite shameful that Nintendo didn't bring back all of the special NPCs from previous games. I think quite a few of them would've made sense if they had been brought back (Blanca for April's Fools or Gracie. However, I think people don't realize that New Horizons currently has more special NPC's than GCN, WW and CF.)

\*\*- Gamecube Animal crossing had 33 special NPCs\*\*.  
**- Animal Crossing: Wild World had 34 special NPCs.**  
**- Animal Crossing: City Folk had 48 special NPCs.**  
**- Animal Crossing: New Leaf had 61 special NPCs.**  
**- Animal Crossing: New Horizons has 50 special NPCs (currently with 3.0 ; prior to 3.0 it had 47 - DLC included in both counts, without DLC it has 44.)**

So yes, I'm also sad about the lack of returning special NPCs (and I can totally understand people being upset as well by this ; especially when I feel like some NPCs were unfairly replaced by items: like the postcard stand or the QR Design Code stand. However, it literally has the most special NPCs compared to the older series. I think there's also quite a few positives from the way these new NPCs have been approached: I absolutely loved learning more about Cyrus and Reese through their wedding anniversary event ; Unlike New Leaf, Blathers will actually tell you more about insects/fish/critters (and his fear of insects is back) ; I thought it was pretty sweet that Brewster shows interest in Gyroids again (though I find it a shame that we can't give him gyroids, like in WW and CF). I also really like that Celeste's, unlike NL, is once again linked to stars and the sky (having falling stars while Celeste is on your island ; her giving your recipes for constellation-based furniture or space related, too, and wands!). C.J. and Flick being there not just for tournaments but also to give you models of insects and fish! Joan being in the hospital (lol) and giving you turnips every Monday! D.J. K.K. holding big raves at the HHP island every Sunday!)

This is also not to mention that we can bring in and have coffee with all special NPCs and decorate their homes at HHP.

While it's definitely a matter of taste and preference, I definitely like the way New Horizons approaches events and festivities. I love seeing how our villagers are more involved in them than in previous games. I also found that in New Leaf, we had lots of festivities that were celebrated with a cardboard for pics. I love the way NH has introduced more ""simple"" but sweet events, like May Day, the Wedding Anniversary Event, Earth Day with Leif (shrubs and the Nook Mile events and International Museum Day with the stamps!)

As a reminder, **Wild World had no ""traditional"" holiday events like in most games.** There was no Bunny Day, Halloween, Turkey Day or Toy Day. I absolutely know that, if Wild World were to be released at that state now a days, it would've been torn to pieces. Anyone saying otherwise, is absolutely lying.

As a point of comparison, here are the number of holidays celebrated per game in the series (not necessarily linked to an event:)

**- Animal Crossing GCN had 27 holidays.**  
**- Animal Crossing WW had 14 holidays.**  
**- Animal Crossing CF had 23 holidays.**  
**- Animal Crossing New Leaf had 21 holidays.**  
**- Animal Crossing New Horizons: 19 holidays (this is not considering the celebratory international event items you get through Nook's Shopping Catalogue, which are much more. I also didn't consider ""seasonal events"" like cherry blossoms/mushroom season, etc.)**

**Returning features (and return to form)**  
I feel like these aren't talked to enough, but New Horizons actually brought back so many features from the older games in the series. New Horizons was able to bring back:

\- The ""up"" camera view like in Animal Crossing Gamecube.  
\- The ""dream like"" sequence of K.K. is similar to Animal Crossing Gamecube.  
\- K.K. playing outside and the sequence is very similar to Animal Crossing Gamecube.  
\- Wisp and Gulliver have roles very similar to Gamecube Animal Crossing.  
\- Message in a bottle from Wild World (though not quite exactly the same.)  
\- Morning Aerobics from Gamecube Animal Crossing.  
\- (Currently, with the 3.0 update Being able to play with older Nintendo consoles (though you do need an NSO account to do so).)  
\- Tiers on the map (like having up to three levels.)  
\- ""Islander"" villagers from Gamecube Animal Crossing.  
\- Cornimer from Wild World.

**Villagers personality and dialogue**  
Probably one of the most repeated points I see around here. Again, it's definitely a matter of taste and preference. I think NH's dialogue is actually pretty good, personally. I find that it can be pretty witty and I really enjoy going around talking to my villagers. NL's dialogue was very much centered on ""tasks"" (bring me this, do that, etc. There's a chunk of dialogue also related to ""did you know if you press the X button... did you know there are lockers in the station..."". You can check some of the differences (though it's not complete) in the transcripts) [here](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Cranky/New_Horizons_dialogue) (NH and) [here](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Guide:Cranky_dialogues_(New_Leaf)) (NL.)

Gamecube and Wild World had very great dialogue, too. Of course, there's the mean villagers part (which I adored, and the sense that they were progressively more friendly to you as they started to know more about you. But I also think that GCN dialogue was flawed at times. I think people may misremember, but it was very repetitive (so it cycled a lot) and a lot of it was also ""press this button to X... ; go here if you want to buy ..."".)

**Concluding thoughts**  
I see lots of people argue that Animal Crossing: New Horizons doesn't feel like Animal Crossing, but I think it would be more fair if people were to frame those comparisons with New Leaf (because they truly mean New Leaf when they compare it to Animal Crossing as a series as a whole. Additionally, I think you are still pretty much free to play NH however you want, but I do see that people generally rush through the game when the game's philosophy and ethos has always been about taking things slowly and one thing at a time. Even then, there's tons of people doing time travel, treasure islands, etc. There's nothing wrong with that. I go to islands from other hemispheres, too. But I think people should also think about what they are doing and how they are approaching the game as part of their criticisms.)

I also think the game needed to re-invent itself. I think there's a very little, niche community of players that still play older Animal Crossing games (myself included. But I'm 100% sure that the big majority of people would not have enjoyed Animal Crossing as much as they do now, because there was just not much to do on the older games. You did your dailys (which were a lot less back then) and that was pretty much it. GCN AC was pretty much a single-player game and it had lots of problems/hassles (like sending your fossils to the museum by mail, lol). I know lots of people would hate on those things today -- and villager interaction alone would not save them (because, as I said, while super creative and fun, they were also quite repetitive).)

City Folk is probably proof of this. It was a carbon-copy of Wild World (with exception of the ""city"" feature, which was pretty lackluster, in general. The game reviewed and sold horribly (to this day, it's the worst-rated game of the series and it's one of the games with the lowest sales, as well ; Happy Home Designer almost sold just as much as CF, lol). So I'm sure that the AC team needed to innovate -- and they did with New Leaf. New Leaf brought a much needed innovative approach to the franchise (which was on the verge of dying). It literally turned Animal Crossing from a niche series into a Nintendo top 5.)

I think New Horizons needed this new approach as well. I don't think the game would've survived as much with a carbon copy design of New Leaf. And the thing is, the game did bring a wave of new players (pandemic aside that has helped the series grow even more.)",43,1762079204.0,AnimalCrossing,24,0.67,False
