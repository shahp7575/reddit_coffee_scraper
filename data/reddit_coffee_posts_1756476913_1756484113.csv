1n3bmmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1n3bmmz/any_recommendations_for_indoor_playground_brands/,Any recommendations for indoor playground brands when starting a kids’ play café?,"I’m in the early stages of setting up a small kids’ play café and one of the biggest decisions I’m facing is choosing the right indoor playground equipment. The idea is to create a space where parents can grab coffee and food while their kids play safely in a structured environment. The space I’ve secured is about 1,200 square feet total, with around 500–600 square feet that I want to dedicate to the play area. My initial budget for the playground setup is in the $15,000–$20,000 range, though I’d like to start closer to the lower end if possible so I can keep some cash for marketing and staffing once we open. I have looked at a ton of options, but the choices are overwhelming. Some playgrounds I’ve seen are basically oversized plastic toys that seem better suited for home use than a business with kids running through every day. On the other end, I’ve found professional-grade installations that cost more than my entire startup budget. I know I need something durable and safe, but I also need to keep startup costs under control. Just don’t think it wise to sink everything into equipment alone. I have been digging into suppliers beyond the local ones and came across a few suppliers on Alibaba, offering modular playgrounds, which could be nice since I could start small and expand later. Others ship full sets that include climbing frames, slides, and soft play areas all in one package. Price ranges are huge depending on materials and safety certifications, and while the specs look good on paper, I really have no way of knowing how they hold up in daily use.

What I am unsure about is how to evaluate which brands actually hold up under daily use. I can read seller specs all day, but what I really need is feedback from people who have been through this. How do these playgrounds handle constant traffic from kids? Are the safety certifications from international suppliers actually reliable? And, if I go the import route, how big of a headache is shipping, customs, and installation? I am trying to strike the right balance between safety, cost, and long-term durability. If the playground falls apart or feels unsafe, it hurts the whole business model. But if I overspend upfront, I will be strapped for cash when I need to invest in marketing and operations. For those of you who have opened play cafés, daycare centers, or similar businesses, which playground brands worked best for you? Did you find better deals sourcing locally, or did importing from suppliers turn out to be worth it in the long run? Any firsthand experiences or advice would mean a lot. This is one of those purchases that feels like it can make or break the whole concept, so I want to get it right.",1,1756483840.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False
1n3bm2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPTSportsWriter/comments/1n3bm2v/top_news_italian_soccer/,Top News: Italian Soccer,"**Italian Soccer: Where Passion Meets Overpriced Coffee and Chaos**  

Ah, Serie A—the land where men weep over espresso and substitute decisions, and the only thing more dramatic than the football is the fashion choices of the ultras. Let’s break down this *bel paese* of chaos:  

1. **Clubs That Sound Like Luxury Car Brands**: Juventus, Inter Milan, AC Milan—oh, how we *adore* the Italian version of the “Big Three” in a soap opera. These clubs have won more trophies than a Renaissance art thief. They’re so good, they’ve probably already invented the sport we all know and love. (Spoiler: They did. In 1863. With a hat.)  

2. **The Scudetto: A Glorified Trophy for 20 Teams to Fight Over**  
   From September to May, these clubs battle for the *scudetto* (a green, white, and red shield that costs €500 on eBay). Matches are usually on Sundays, because nothing says “family time” like yelling at the TV as your team gets destroyed by a 17-year-old wonderkid. And if you thought the drama was intense? Wait until the top four also juggle the Champions League. Europe’s best? No, it’s just Italy’s best at pretending they’re not terrified of Liverpool.  

3. **National Team: Four World Cups, Zero Apologies**  
   Italy’s national team is like a Michelin-starred chef—*classico*, *premiato*, and occasionally *overconfident*. They’ve won the World Cup four times (1934, 1938, 1982, 2006) and somehow still manage to field a team that makes fans question every life choice that led them to this moment. Fun fact: Their 2006 victory was so iconic, even the Pope gave them a standing ovation. (He later admitted he was just there for the snacks.)  

4. **Champions League: Where Italy and Spain Have a Love-Hate Relationship**  
   When Roma faces Real Madrid in the Champions League, it’s less of a football match and more of a cultural war. The entire peninsula holds its breath, sips Aperol Spritzes, and hopes the referee is *Italian*. (Spoiler: He’s not. But we’ll pretend he is.)  

5. **Streaming? Please. We’ve Mastered the Art of Suffering**  
   Thanks to Paramount+ (because why watch live when you can stream?), you can now witness Christian Pulisic and Lautaro Martínez either heroically scoring or heroically tripping over their own feet. CBS Sports will helpfully update you on scores, because nothing says “I care” like checking your phone during dinner to see if your team lost 7-0.  

**Verdict**: Serie A is a masterclass in drama, history, and overpriced stadium snacks. It’s the only league where the halftime show is more entertaining than the actual game. Now go bet on Juventus to win—*if* they bribe the referees. *Sei fortunato*.",1,1756483806.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False
1n3bl5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Santiago/comments/1n3bl5d/one_week_in_santiago_sept_613_food_and_wine/,One week in Santiago Sept 6-13. Food and wine recommendations porfa!,"My wife (31f) and I (34m) will be travelling from Canada to Chile for 3 weeks. I will be with my parents in Santiago who were born there, in between visiting all my familia we’re looking for recommendations for the best restaurants and places to drink. We are staying in Las Condes for the week. 

This is our itinerary so far 

Sept 6 - familia 
Sept 7 - familia 
Sept 8 - Conche Y Torro wine tour during the day 
Sept 9 - Chile vs Uruguay futbol 
Sept 10 - vino and musica at Cerro San Cristobal 
Sept 11 - *I’m assuming this day is some sort of holiday in the country, is everything open?*
Sept 12 - No plans 
Sept 13 - no plans but leaving for Viña del mar around lunch time 

On days not involving familia I’m hoping to get some recommendations on high end, good quality restaurants. Fun bars for vino and pisco. Live music and places to dance (my cueca is rusty jajaja). My parents and familia will be taking us for all the Chilean staples (local restaurants) but aren’t up to date with more vibrant or expensive places. Cool coffee shops, clothing stores, record stores and tourist places that are actually worth checking out would be much appreciated. 

We will be taking Uber and taxi to all places that we can’t walk from our rental home. 

Oh and anywhere I can buy cigars would be much appreciated. 

This will be my first trip back to Chile in 30 years, to say I’m excited is an understatement!

Review Inside,"The **Ninja CFP301 Coffee Maker** combines remarkable features and flexibility with a sleek design, capturing the attention of coffee enthusiasts like myself. Over a few weeks, I tested this versatile coffee system daily—exploring its capabilities with pods and ground coffee. While immensely satisfied with its performance, there are certain quirks that might need attention.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The aesthetic appeal of this coffee maker is undeniable. Its compact, black body with functional controls makes it a great fit for modern kitchens. Measuring 9.13""D x 11.39""W x 15.54""H, it didn't demand much counter space. The build feels sturdy; the Ninja DualBrew Pro isn't overly bulky or flimsy. I also appreciated its fold-away frother, cleverly integrating utility into the design without consuming extra space. The removable 60-ounce multi-position water reservoir was another feature that stood out—practical for easy refills and adaptable to accommodate different kitchen layouts.

**Performance and Brew Customizations**  
This coffee maker excels in versatility. The machine handles both K-Cup pods and ground coffee effortlessly, catering to various preferences in my household. From brewing options like Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Specialty, the system managed each style consistently, extracting nuanced flavors. I tested its specialty brew option to create cappuccinos and was very impressed with the rich concentrate it produced for coffeehouse-like drinks. However, while the machine brews pretty efficiently, I noticed that the specialty brew mode takes slightly longer than anticipated.

**[Check Ninja CFP301 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08qzsn97z/)**  

**Ease of Use**  
For a gadget packed with features, this was surprisingly straightforward to use. The bright buttons made selecting brewing styles simple. I personally tested the hot water dispensing mode to prepare tea and instant soups. With its independent water system, which features two temperature settings, cross-contamination of flavors was entirely avoided—a thoughtful touch.

**Key Benefits**  
- Handles both pods and grounds with a wide range of brewing sizes.  
- Built-in, fold-away frother ensures easy frothing.  
- Independent hot water system eliminates flavor mixing.  
- Specialty brew option for concentrated coffeehouse drinks.  

**Limitations**  
Despite its many strengths, there were some aspects less glowing.  
- Cleaning can be tricky; the fold-away frother collects residue over time.  
- The brewing cycle for full carafes felt noisier compared to single-serve modes.  
- Specialty coffee enthusiasts might find it lacks manual adjustments for temperature control.  

**Other Options**  
When compared to competing brands like Keurig K-Elite, the Ninja CFP301 wins in terms of versatility. The Keurig excels with its simplicity and slightly quieter operation, but it lacks the specialty coffee options or fold-away frother present in the Ninja. Another contender, the Breville Bambino Plus, may prepare barista-level espresso drinks, but it doesn’t support K-Cup pods or provide the same extensive brewing range. All-in-all, the Ninja strikes a unique balance for those wanting variety without requiring additional devices.

**Price Performance**  
Considering its robust feature set, I found this coffee system to be fairly priced. While some features like manual adjustments might appeal to more advanced users, its versatility and ease of use make up for that. The included components—such as the Ninja smart scoop, glass carafe, pod adapter, and fold-away frother—add significant value, justifying the price point.

Life isn't a fairy tale where everything is sunshine and rainbows. If you've ever wondered why you sometimes feel like you're battling contradictory forces within yourself, you're not alone. The truth is, being human means carrying both light and shadow within us—and that's perfectly normal.

## The Reality of Human Nature ⚖️

Think about it: have you ever met someone who's purely positive all the time? Someone who never gets frustrated, never feels doubt, never experiences a bad mood? Probably not, because such a person doesn't exist in the real world.

We're complex beings with multiple facets. Just like a coin has two sides, every person carries contrasting elements within their personality. You might be incredibly kind to others but harsh on yourself. You could be confident in some areas while feeling insecure in others. This isn't a flaw—it's the human condition.

## Understanding Your Visible and Hidden Sides 👁️

Picture yourself standing in a room. You can see what's in front of you—the furniture, the walls, the windows. But you can't see what's behind you without turning around. This simple concept applies to self-awareness too.

Your ""front side"" represents what you're conscious of: your visible actions, your known strengths, your acknowledged thoughts and feelings. It's the version of yourself you present to the world and the parts of your personality you readily recognize.

Your ""back side"" represents what remains hidden: unconscious patterns, suppressed emotions, forgotten memories, and aspects of yourself you might prefer not to acknowledge. These aren't necessarily negative—they're just less visible to your everyday awareness.

## Why Perfect Positivity Is Actually Impossible 🚫

Here's something our culture often gets wrong: the idea that we should eliminate all negative thoughts and emotions. This approach is like trying to remove all shadows from the world by making the sun brighter. It doesn't work, and it's exhausting to attempt.

Consider these everyday examples:
- A parent who's loving and patient most of the time will still feel frustrated when their child throws a tantrum in public
- A generous person might occasionally feel resentful when others take advantage of their kindness  
- An optimistic individual will still experience sadness during difficult times

These contrasts aren't personality defects—they're signs of a fully functioning human being.

## The Power of Acknowledging Both Sides 🔍

When you stop fighting against your complexity and start embracing it, something interesting happens: you gain genuine self-understanding. Instead of being surprised or ashamed when you experience difficult emotions or thoughts, you can recognize them as part of your complete self.

This awareness brings several practical benefits:

**Better Decision-Making**: When you understand your full range of motivations and reactions, you can make choices that account for your real tendencies rather than your idealized self-image.

**Reduced Internal Conflict**: Fighting against parts of yourself creates tension. Accepting your complexity reduces this internal struggle.

**Authentic Relationships**: People connect more deeply with those who are genuine rather than those trying to maintain a perfect facade.

**Improved Problem-Solving**: Understanding your limitations and triggers helps you develop better strategies for handling challenges.

## Practical Steps for Daily Integration 🛠️

### Morning Reflection Practice
Start each day with a brief check-in with yourself. Instead of asking ""How do I want to feel today?"" try asking ""How am I actually feeling right now, and what do I need?""

### The Both/And Approach
When you catch yourself thinking in extremes (""I'm terrible at this"" or ""I'm amazing at everything""), practice adding ""and"" statements:
- ""I struggled with that presentation AND I'm learning from the experience""
- ""I felt jealous of my colleague's success AND I'm genuinely happy for them""
- ""I made a mistake AND I'm capable of doing better next time""

### Honest Journaling
Write about both your successes and struggles without trying to fix or judge either. Simply observe and record what you notice about your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

### Conversation with Contrast
When talking with friends or family, practice being honest about both positive and challenging aspects of your experiences. This models healthy authenticity and often leads to more meaningful conversations.

## Navigating Your Inner Landscape 🗺️

Think of self-exploration like mapping unfamiliar territory. You wouldn't want to explore only the beautiful meadows while ignoring the rocky terrain—you'd miss important information about the complete landscape.

Your personal ""difficult terrain"" might include:
- Fears you haven't fully examined
- Patterns of behavior that don't serve you well
- Emotions you tend to avoid or suppress
- Aspects of your past that still influence your present choices

Your personal ""beautiful meadows"" might include:
- Strengths you take for granted
- Moments of joy and connection
- Values that guide your decisions
- Dreams and aspirations that energize you

Both areas deserve attention and exploration.

## Finding Your Center Point 🎯

The goal isn't to eliminate contrasts within yourself, but to find a stable center from which you can acknowledge and work with all aspects of your personality. This center point is characterized by:

**Curiosity Instead of Judgment**: Approaching your discoveries about yourself with interest rather than criticism.

**Flexibility Rather Than Rigidity**: Being willing to adjust your self-concept as you learn new things about yourself.

**Acceptance Without Resignation**: Acknowledging difficult aspects of yourself while still working toward positive change where appropriate.

**Integration Over Division**: Seeing your various traits and tendencies as parts of a whole rather than separate, competing elements.

## Real-World Applications 💼

### In Professional Settings
Understanding your complete self helps you choose work environments and roles that suit your actual personality rather than your idealized version. If you know you need both social interaction and quiet thinking time, you can structure your work accordingly.

### In Relationships
Healthy relationships thrive when both people can be authentic about their full range of experiences. This doesn't mean dumping every difficult emotion on your partner, but it does mean being honest about your real thoughts and feelings rather than maintaining a perfect facade.

### In Personal Growth
True development happens when you work with your actual starting point rather than where you think you should be. If you tend to be disorganized, the solution isn't to pretend you're naturally organized—it's to develop systems that work with your actual tendencies.

### In Daily Challenges
When facing difficulties, you can draw on your complete toolkit of responses. Sometimes the situation calls for optimism and persistence; other times it requires caution and careful analysis. Having access to your full range of capabilities serves you better than trying to respond from just one mode.

## The Long-Term Perspective 🔮

This approach to self-understanding isn't a quick fix—it's a sustainable way of living that becomes more valuable over time. As decades pass, the ability to work with your complete self rather than fighting against parts of it pays increasing dividends.

Consider how this mindset might serve you:
- In your 30s, when career and relationship choices require honest self-assessment
- In your 40s, when life transitions demand flexibility and resilience  
- In your 50s, when experience has shown you the value of authentic living
- In your 60s and beyond, when wisdom comes from integrating all of life's experiences

## Moving Forward with Wholeness ➡️

Living with awareness of your complete self doesn't mean being paralyzed by complexity or using your ""shadow side"" as an excuse for harmful behavior. Instead, it means making conscious choices about how to express different aspects of yourself in appropriate contexts.

You might channel your competitive nature into sports rather than workplace politics. You might use your tendency toward worry as a signal to prepare more thoroughly for important events. You might transform your frustration into motivation for positive change.

The key is conscious choice based on honest self-knowledge rather than unconscious reaction based on incomplete self-awareness.

## Your Journey Forward 🚶‍♀️

Remember that this process of self-integration is ongoing. You don't need to have everything figured out immediately. Start where you are, with what you know about yourself right now, and remain open to new discoveries.

Every person you'll meet is also navigating their own complexity. Every situation you'll encounter will call for different aspects of your personality. By embracing your wholeness now, you prepare yourself to respond authentically and effectively to whatever life brings your way.

The goal isn't perfection—it's integration. It's showing up as your complete, complex, wonderfully human self in a world that needs exactly what you have to offer.

Frontier fortunes and investor risks collide in Canada’s untamed Yukon, where Rick Rule’s Investment Newsletter dissects discovery, disaster, and opportunity.

https://preview.redd.it/gt7hxfnwezlf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=03cedca5cd4af2b846f592212e1d2a12b7869b54

The Yukon is a land of staggering contrasts, where towering peaks, rolling rivers, and dense pine forests hide an immense geological prize. For investors, this northern expanse of Canada represents both untapped promise and sobering cautionary tales. In his latest Rule Investment Newsletter, Rick Rule reminds readers why the Yukon has captivated explorers for generations and why disciplined investors should pay attention to the territory’s unfolding story.

**The Allure of Untapped Riches**

Yukon remains one of the least explored mining jurisdictions in the world. This is no small fact in an age when new large-scale discoveries are becoming rare. Over 20 million ounces of gold have been defined in a narrow stretch of the Tombstone Belt, placing the region alongside some of the world’s most promising exploration fronts. Banyan Gold and Snowline Gold alone have outlined deposits exceeding seven million ounces each, proof that Yukon can host not just one but several district-scale systems.

Investors are drawn to the scale. The idea that multiple five-million-ounce discoveries may lie hidden beneath Yukon’s rugged surface is intoxicating for majors searching for multi-decade projects. Rick Rule emphasizes that scarcity drives value. The global mining industry is desperate for new deposits, and Yukon continues to deliver.

**The Whiplash of Investor Sentiment**

But the path is never smooth. The bankruptcy of Victoria Gold following the heap leach failure at its Eagle mine in 2024 rattled investor confidence. Overnight, explorers across the territory saw their valuations collapse, not because of their own technical failings but because markets feared Yukon itself might be unworkable. Rule notes this cycle of euphoria and despair is the very fabric of resource investing. Weak hands exit in panic while disciplined capital waits patiently for clarity.

The report into Eagle’s collapse concluded that heap leaching was not fundamentally flawed, but poorly executed. That distinction matters. Banyan’s shift toward mill-based processing, focusing on higher-grade zones at Aurmac, was partly informed by this lesson. For investors, the rebound in Yukon explorer share prices after the initial shock illustrates a deeper truth: geology doesn’t change, sentiment does.

**Capital Flows Return**

Despite the turbulence, capital is flowing back into the territory. Yukon explorers raised nearly C$200 million in 2024 and are on track to match that pace this year. Rule’s own portfolio has benefitted. Rackla Metals and Sitka Gold have soared more than 400 percent in the past twelve months, a testament to the market’s hunger for early-stage discovery potential.

Majors are circling. B2Gold’s stake in Snowline, Agnico Eagle’s position in White Gold, and Rio Tinto’s strategic interest in Western Copper & Gold demonstrate that the big players still view Yukon as fertile hunting ground. Yet Rule cautions that not every corporate investment turns into a mine. Goldcorp’s much-hyped acquisition of Kaminak’s Coffee project still sits undeveloped under Newmont’s ownership, now up for sale. Investors, Rule advises, must separate geological reality from market mythology.

**The Standout Projects**

Several companies emerge as central characters in Yukon’s investment story. Banyan Gold’s Aurmac, with 7.7 million ounces outlined, is pushing toward a mill-based PEA that could deliver 300,000 ounces of annual production. Snowline’s Valley deposit, with its high grades and extraordinary intercepts, is already being spoken of as one of Canada’s largest future mines. Rackla Metals is testing whether the Tombstone Belt’s golden reach stretches into the Northwest Territories. Sitka Gold, through aggressive drilling, is assembling a land package that could define a new district. Fireweed Metals, armed with U.S. Department of Defense funding, is pushing tungsten and zinc into the spotlight at Mactung and Macpass. Gladiator Metals is reviving Whitehorse’s forgotten copper belt. Western Copper’s Casino project, meanwhile, remains a giant waiting for infrastructure and cheap power to make it viable.

Rule is clear that scale, metallurgy, and location matter most. Projects with infrastructure advantages, high-grade cores, and district potential will draw the majors when consolidation sweeps through.

**The Infrastructure Dilemma**

Infrastructure is Yukon’s Achilles heel. Power shortages and road access remain critical obstacles. The territory’s hydro grid is stretched thin, forcing both Snowline and Banyan to model diesel-powered operations. Western Copper plans to use LNG for Casino, but the economics remain marginal compared to the cheap, clean power majors demand. Ottawa’s pledge to study a Yukon–British Columbia grid intertie is welcome, but billions of dollars and years of negotiation stand in the way.

Rule’s message is blunt: geology alone does not make a mine. Without roads, power, and First Nations alignment, even the richest deposits can languish. Investors must weigh these realities carefully.

**The Shadow of Victoria Gold**

Victoria’s downfall casts a long shadow. Once Yukon’s flagship producer, the company’s bankruptcy underscores both the risks and the stakes. Its Eagle mine, along with the Raven deposit and Brewery Creek, are now up for grabs through PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Whoever takes control will instantly become Yukon’s dominant player, with the power to reshape sentiment across the territory. Rule argues that if a deep-pocketed major steps in, it will be a vote of confidence in Yukon that lifts all boats.

The government has every incentive to make this happen. With Victoria gone, Yukon has lost its largest taxpayer. Federal transfers keep the territory afloat, but long-term sustainability requires mining revenues. A successful sale of Eagle would not only restore production but also reassure global investors that Yukon is open for business.

**Rick Rule’s Yukon Thesis**

Rick Rule has spent a career navigating the booms and busts of resource investing. His Yukon thesis distills to a simple idea: the territory is a frontier with world-class potential, but only disciplined investors will thrive. Those who buy when fear dominates, and sell when euphoria peaks, will capture the asymmetric rewards. Projects like Snowline, Banyan, Rackla, and Sitka may not all succeed, but even one more world-class discovery could be transformative.

Yukon, he argues, is not just a bet on geology but on human resilience, capital discipline, and the slow grind of infrastructure development. For investors willing to stomach volatility, it is precisely the kind of jurisdiction where fortunes are made.

**Conclusion**

The Yukon story is still being written. It is a place of giants and ghosts, of billion-dollar valuations and sudden bankruptcies, of soaring drill intercepts and stubborn logistical challenges. Rick Rule’s Investment Newsletter paints a vivid picture of both promise and peril. For those who can navigate sentiment swings and keep their eyes on the rocks beneath the tundra, Yukon remains one of the most compelling frontier plays on the planet.",1,1756483412.0,Junior_Stocks,0,1.0,False
1n3bfts,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedForYou/comments/1n3bfts/delve_into_whether_cascade_dishwasher_detergent/,Delve Into Whether Cascade Dishwasher Detergent Truly Delivers,"Using the Cascade Platinum P_15209 dishwasher detergent has been an interesting experience for me. I’m someone who enjoys cooking and hosts frequent dinners, which inevitably means dealing with piles of dishes. Over the past few weeks, I have put this product through all sorts of trials, from greasy pots and pans to delicate glassware with leftover coffee stains, and it has become a reliable ally in my kitchen cleanup routine. Its compact, pre-measured pods promise to make life easier—but is it all smooth sailing? Let me share my honest take.

**Ease of Functionality and Design**  
The concept of pre-measured pods is something I truly appreciate. These little ActionPacs eliminate the guesswork of pouring powdered detergent or chasing down a specific liquid-to-powder ratio. I simply pop one into the designated slot in my dishwasher, close the lid, and start the machine. The pod dissolves quickly after the cycle begins, ensuring that the detergent’s full power is unlocked right away. This was especially helpful with baked-on lasagna remnants that usually laugh in the face of lesser detergents. I didn’t feel like I was experimenting or making a mess while using these pods, which is a big win for someone who loves neatness.  

**Features That Stand Out**  
Its formulation includes Dawn’s grease-fighting power combined with food-seeking enzymes, making it highly effective on pretty much anything I challenged it with. Somehow, it separates food particles like a detective solving a mystery and breaks them down incredibly well, regardless of how stubborn they might seem. The pods even combat hard water stains, which is a major perk considering water spots and filming are all too common. I noticed this especially with my glass dishes—they emerged gleaming and spotless, like a mirror you could eat off. On top of that, these ActionPacs are phosphate-free, making them a more environmentally conscious choice.

**Positives**  
A few notable highlights really enhance its appeal:  
- Perfectly measured pods make usage foolproof.  
- Effectively cleans stubborn messes, even grease or baked-on food.  
- Removes hard water spots and keeps glassware sparkling clean.  
- Saves time by eliminating the need for pre-washing.  
- Phosphate-free and safe for plumbing and dishwashing machines.  

[Check Cascade Platinum P_15209 price on Amazon.](https://reviews.sanue.com/p/b0dr3hbksb/)  

**Downsides to Consider**  
However, not everything is spotless with this product. A few negatives stood out during use:  
- Some extra-tough pots or pans required a second wash occasionally.  
- Fragrant, which some people might find overpowering for sensitive noses.  
- The pods can sometimes clump together in humid conditions.  

These are not deal-breakers by any means, but things to keep in mind based on your preferences and dishwasher habits.

**Energy Efficiency and Water Conservation**  
One thing I didn’t fully appreciate until I delved into the details was how these pods contribute to water conservation. By skipping pre-washing, I was able to save up to 20 gallons of water per load. For someone like me who runs the dishwasher daily, the thought of saving water while maintaining spotlessly clean dishes was a fantastic bonus. Using ENERGY STAR-certified dishwashers amplifies these benefits further. Knowing I was being both efficient and environmentally friendly added to the satisfaction of using this product.

**Competitors**  
When pitted against alternatives like Finish Quantum Tabs or the Seventh Generation Dishwasher Detergent Packs, Cascade Platinum holds its ground firmly. While Finish excels in providing a high shine, Cascade seems to edge ahead in versatility, cleaning both cookware and fragile glassware equally well. On the other hand, eco-conscious users might prefer the Seventh Generation packs for their natural ingredients, but I personally found them less effective on baked-on residue. In terms of overall cleaning power and reliability, these ActionPacs remain unmatched in my experience.

**Value for Money**  
Talking about cost efficiency, these pods strike a decent balance between affordability and performance. While they are priced slightly higher than standard detergents, the results are worth the extra investment. You save time, water, and effort, not to mention avoiding unnecessary rewashes that could rack up more energy costs. Considering its key features and reliable performance, I’d say it offers true value for your money.

## Introduction: The Quest for Continuous Growth 🌱

In our rapidly evolving world, the ability to learn, adapt, and create has become more valuable than ever. Whether you're a student, professional, artist, or lifelong learner, developing a systematic approach to acquiring knowledge and skills can transform your life. This comprehensive guide explores practical principles that have helped countless individuals unlock their creative and intellectual potential throughout history.

## Essential Qualities for Effective Learning 🎯

### 1. Cultivate Genuine Curiosity 🔍

The foundation of all meaningful learning begins with an insatiable curiosity about the world around us. Curious individuals ask better questions, explore deeper connections, and remain open to new possibilities. To develop this quality:

**Daily Actions:**
- Ask ""why"" and ""how"" at least five times during conversations
- Read articles outside your field of expertise weekly
- Engage with people from different backgrounds and perspectives
- Keep a curiosity journal where you record interesting questions that occur to you

**Real-world Benefits:**
Curiosity drives innovation in every field. Steve Jobs attributed Apple's success to his team's curiosity about user experience. Scientists make breakthrough discoveries by questioning accepted assumptions. Artists create revolutionary works by exploring uncharted creative territories.

- Use your skills to solve meaningful problems
- Respect intellectual property and copyrights
- Consider the broader impact of your actions and creations

**Long-term Benefits:**
Ethical behavior builds trust and reputation, leading to better opportunities, collaborations, and mentorship relationships. People are more willing to share advanced knowledge with those they trust.

### 7. Commit to Regular Practice and Self-Development 🎭

Systematic practice—not just any practice, but deliberate, focused improvement—is the engine of skill development. This involves regularly challenging yourself just beyond your current comfort zone.

**Designing Effective Practice:**
- Identify specific weaknesses and target them
- Break complex skills into manageable components
- Seek immediate feedback on your performance
- Gradually increase difficulty as you improve
- Maintain a growth mindset toward challenges

**Examples Across Disciplines:**
Musicians practice scales and études; writers work on specific techniques like dialogue or description; programmers solve increasingly complex coding challenges; artists study fundamentals like light, form, and composition.

### 8. Cultivate Humility and Gratitude 🙏

Paradoxically, the more you learn, the more you realize how much you don't know. This humility opens doors to continued learning and attracts teachers and collaborators who enjoy working with receptive students.

**Practical Humility:**
- Ask questions even when you think you know the answer
- Thank teachers, mentors, and peers for their contributions
- Acknowledge when you're wrong and learn from mistakes
- Celebrate others' successes and learn from their approaches
- Remain open to feedback and constructive criticism

**The Gratitude Factor:**
Expressing genuine appreciation strengthens relationships and often leads to additional learning opportunities. People remember students who acknowledge their contributions and are more likely to offer future help.

### 9. Develop a Learning-Oriented Mindset 🧘‍♂️

Your fundamental beliefs about learning and ability significantly impact your success. Research shows that people with ""growth mindsets"" consistently outperform those who believe abilities are fixed.

**Characteristics of Learning-Oriented Thinking:**
- View challenges as opportunities for growth
- See effort as a path to mastery, not a sign of inadequacy
- Learn from criticism and setbacks
- Find inspiration in others' success
- Persist in the face of obstacles

**Practical Application:**
Instead of saying ""I'm not good at math,"" say ""I'm still learning math."" This subtle shift in language reflects a fundamental change in how you approach difficulties and setbacks.

### 10. Think Beyond Personal Benefit 🌍

The most impactful learners think about how their knowledge and skills can benefit others and society. This expansive perspective often leads to breakthrough innovations and meaningful contributions.

**Cultivating an Expansive Mindset:**
- Consider how your learning can solve real-world problems
- Share knowledge through teaching, writing, or mentoring
- Collaborate with others on meaningful projects
- Think about the legacy you want to create
- Connect your personal growth to larger purposes

**Clearer Thinking:** Regular intellectual challenge improves your ability to think logically and see through confusion to underlying principles.

## Why Some People Struggle to Develop Their Potential 🤔

Understanding common obstacles helps you avoid them and develop more effective learning strategies:

### Lack of Genuine Commitment 

Many people express interest in learning but don't make the consistent effort required for real progress. They:
- Set unrealistic expectations for quick results
- Give up when initial enthusiasm wanes
- Skip the fundamentals in favor of advanced techniques
- Fail to create systems that support consistent practice

### Insufficient Emotional Investment 💔

Learning requires more than intellectual interest—it demands emotional engagement:
- Some approach learning purely as obligation rather than opportunity
- Others fear failure so much they avoid challenging themselves
- Many lack clear connections between their learning goals and personal values
- Some give up too easily when progress seems slow

### Inconsistent Practice Patterns ⏰

Sporadic effort produces sporadic results:
- Weekend warriors who practice intensively but infrequently
- People who constantly switch between different subjects without developing depth
- Those who practice only when they feel motivated
- Learners who don't track their progress or adjust their approaches

### Unrealistic Expectations 🎯

Misunderstanding the learning process leads to frustration and abandonment:
- Expecting linear progress rather than the typical ups and downs
- Comparing their beginning efforts to experts' polished work
- Underestimating the time required for genuine skill development
- Focusing exclusively on outcomes rather than enjoying the process

### Missing the Guidance Factor 🗺️

Trying to learn everything independently often leads to:
- Developing bad habits that are hard to correct later
- Spending years on ineffective practice methods
- Missing crucial insights that experts could share quickly
- Lacking accountability and external perspective on progress

What I like most is its flexibility, you can brew a single cup when you just need one, or make a full 12-cup pot when more people want coffee.

**Pros**

* The FlexBrew Trio allows you to brew a single serve using K-Cups or ground coffee, as well as a full pot, catering to varying preferences and quantities.
* With straightforward controls and clear instructions, it's easy to operate, even for those who are not tech-savvy.
* Despite its dual functionality, the machine is compact enough to fit comfortably in most kitchen spaces or office break rooms.
* Provides great value for money, especially considering the dual brewing options without needing separate machines.

**Cons**

* While the single-serve option is quick, brewing a full pot can take a bit longer than some other models.
* Regular cleaning is necessary to maintain performance, particularly when switching between single-serve and full-pot modes.

It’s a great choice if you want a machine that can handle both personal use and small gatherings. The design is easy to use, and it works well with both ground coffee and pods. If you’re looking for a practical coffee maker that does both single-serve and pot brewing, this one is a solid pick. This post may contain Amazon affiliate links.

Although I wasn’t raised with strict teachings about things like drinking coffee or having premarital sex, I was still raised in an environment where my parents hadn’t fully deprogrammed themselves from the fears and anxieties that came with their upbringing in the church.

As a result, I grew up internalizing some of those fears, even though I wasn’t taught the church's doctrines directly. Recently, my therapist and I discovered that I’ve developed a form of religious trauma due to this. I’ve realized that I internalized many of the negative aspects of Mormonism (believing I'm worthless without attachment to something bigger than myself, reliance on self-sufficiency to a fault, believing my physical disability is my fault, etc), without receiving the positive aspects, such as the belief in eternal families or the sense of community the church provides.

I’m wondering if others have had similar experiences. What are some of the deeper, less obvious beliefs or fears you’ve had to unlearn or deprogram from Mormonism? Not just the surface-level teachings, but the more subtle mindsets that shaped how you see yourself, others, or the world? What should I on the lookout for in my own psyche?

I (19) couple of months ago found out that my father(M47)cheated on my mom(F48) because he just casually told me that while venting about how annoying my mom is. I dont know with who or exactly when all i know is that it was someone from his improv group. My mom knew about that and she stayed with him because as she told me ""she feared that me and my siblings would loose something if our parents werent together"". My siblings (M16 and F14) didint know that our father cheated till two weeks ago and when my brother came up to me when we were alone in the house and told me that he seen our father use Tinder and saw that he was planning to meet up with some woman for coffee. I also seen Tinder on his phone but i didnt see him texting anyone. I told my brother that i knew that our father is using Tinder and that he cheated on our mom before because he figured it out alredy and im sick of being the only one to know about how terrible of a partner our father is. Now tne only one that doesnt know is our sister but i dont really want to tell her before we tell our mom that hes cheating again. Now here comes the issue. I dont know how to tell my mom that my father is using dating apps and meeting up with other women. I dont have any proof other than what me and my brother both saw. I tried to find my fathers dating profile but i couldnt. How do i tell her? I know she will belive me but i really dont want to show up with no proof. Please give me some ideas on what to do...

*A practical guide to returning to what feels most natural*

---

## 🌅 The Foundation We All Share

Picture a newborn baby. What do you see? Pure openness, curiosity, and an innate ability to connect. That tiny human hasn't learned to build walls, create defensive strategies, or worry about tomorrow's problems. They simply *are* – present, receptive, and naturally drawn toward warmth and connection.

This isn't about spirituality or belief systems. It's about recognizing something profound yet practical: we enter this world wired for connection, trust, and openness. What we call ""love"" is simply our default operating system – the natural state of being receptive, curious, and engaged with life around us.

## 🧠 How We Learn to Protect Ourselves

As we grow, something inevitable happens. We experience disappointment, rejection, criticism, and hurt. Our brilliant minds, designed to keep us safe, begin cataloging these experiences:

*""Remember when you trusted that person and got hurt?""*
*""Don't be too enthusiastic – people might think you're weird.""*
*""Better to expect the worst so you won't be disappointed.""*

These protective mechanisms aren't wrong or bad. They served a purpose. Your mind was doing its job, building shields to prevent future pain. But somewhere along the way, many of us noticed that these shields, while protective, also became barriers to the very connections and experiences that make life meaningful.

## 🔄 The Journey Back to Authenticity

Here's where things get interesting. The path forward isn't about learning something entirely new – it's about remembering and reconnecting with what was always there underneath all those protective layers.

Think of it like this: imagine you're wearing multiple coats because you were once very cold. As the weather warms up, you might slowly realize you don't need all those layers anymore. Taking them off doesn't make you vulnerable – it makes you more comfortable and free to move naturally.

### 🎯 Daily Practice: Noticing Your Protective Patterns

**Morning Check-in (2 minutes):**
- Before checking your phone or rushing into the day, pause
- Ask yourself: ""What am I bracing for today?""
- Notice where you feel tension in your body
- Take three deep breaths and imagine releasing that tension

**Throughout the Day:**
- When you catch yourself in defensive mode, pause and ask: ""What am I trying to protect myself from right now?""
- Remember: awareness is the first step, not judgment

## 💡 Practical Ways to Reconnect with Openness

### 🌱 Start Small: The Micro-Connection Experiment

You don't need to overhaul your entire life. Small shifts create ripple effects:

**With Strangers:**
- Make genuine eye contact with the cashier
- Ask someone ""How's your day going?"" and actually listen to the answer
- Say ""thank you"" like you really mean it

**With Family/Friends:**
- Put your phone away during conversations
- Share something real about your day instead of just ""fine""
- Ask questions that go beyond surface level

**With Yourself:**
- Notice when you're being self-critical and speak to yourself like you would a good friend
- Take breaks from productivity to simply exist without agenda
- Practice saying ""I don't know"" when you don't know something

### 🔑 The Fear Recognition Toolkit

Fear often masquerades as other things. Learning to recognize its various forms helps you respond rather than react:

**Fear might show up as:**
- Perfectionism (*""If I do this perfectly, I won't be criticized""*)
- People-pleasing (*""If I make everyone happy, they won't abandon me""*)
- Cynicism (*""If I expect nothing, I won't be disappointed""*)
- Busyness (*""If I stay busy, I don't have to face uncomfortable feelings""*)
- Criticism of others (*""If I point out their flaws first, they won't notice mine""*)

**When you notice these patterns:**
1. Pause and acknowledge: ""I notice I'm in protection mode right now""
2. Ask: ""What would I do if I felt completely safe in this moment?""
3. Take one small action from that place of imagined safety

## 🌍 Creating Connection in a Disconnected World

### The Ripple Effect Principle

When you operate from a place of openness rather than defensiveness, something magical happens. Other people sense it. They unconsciously mirror your energy. One genuine interaction can shift the entire atmosphere of a room, a workplace, or even a family dynamic.

**Real-world applications:**

**At Work:**
- Instead of immediately defending your ideas, listen fully to feedback first
- Share credit generously
- Ask colleagues about their challenges, not just their achievements

**In Relationships:**
- Express appreciation for specific things people do
- Admit when you're wrong without over-explaining
- Choose vulnerability over being right

**In Conflict:**
- Lead with curiosity: ""Help me understand your perspective""
- Focus on the issue, not attacking the person
- Look for the underlying need behind someone's complaint

### 🎪 The Social Courage Challenge

Pick one social situation where you typically feel guarded:

**Week 1:** Simply notice your protective reactions without trying to change them
**Week 2:** Experiment with staying present for 30 seconds longer than feels comfortable
**Week 3:** Share one genuine thought or feeling you'd normally keep to yourself
**Week 4:** Ask someone a question you're genuinely curious about but would normally avoid

## 🧭 Navigating Setbacks and Resistance

### When Old Patterns Resurface

Your protective mechanisms developed for good reasons. They won't disappear overnight, and that's completely normal. The goal isn't to eliminate them but to develop a healthier relationship with them.

**Instead of fighting defensive thoughts:**
- Thank them for trying to protect you
- Ask if their protection is needed in this specific moment
- Choose your response consciously rather than automatically

**When others resist your authenticity:**
Some people might be uncomfortable when you change. They're used to interacting with your defended self. Stay consistent with your new approach while being patient with their adjustment period.

### The Comfort Zone Expansion Method

Growth happens at the edge of your comfort zone, not in the middle of terror or in complete safety:

**Too Safe:** Staying exactly the same, avoiding all risk
**Growth Zone:** Mild discomfort, manageable challenge, conscious choice
**Danger Zone:** Overwhelming fear, forced situations, trauma responses

Aim for the growth zone – that place where you feel slightly nervous but fundamentally okay.

## 🎨 Building Your Personal Connection Practice

### Design Your Daily Reconnection Ritual

Create a simple daily practice that helps you return to openness:

**Morning Intention Setting:**
- What kind of person do I want to be today?
- How do I want people to feel after interacting with me?
- What would I do today if I felt completely secure?

**Evening Reflection:**
- When did I feel most connected today?
- Where did I notice myself closing off, and what triggered it?
- What's one thing I appreciated about myself today?

### The 30-Day Connection Experiment

Choose one area of your life where you'd like to feel more open and connected. Commit to small daily actions for 30 days:

**Examples:**
- Express genuine appreciation to one person daily
- Share one vulnerable truth with someone you trust each week
- Practice saying ""yes"" to invitations you'd normally decline out of fear
- Spend 10 minutes daily without distractions, just being present

## 🌈 The Long-Term Vision

### What Changes When You Operate from Connection

**Energy levels increase:** You're not constantly managing defensive strategies
**Relationships deepen:** People sense your authenticity and respond in kind
**Decision-making improves:** You choose based on values rather than fears
**Creativity flows:** Without constant self-censoring, new ideas emerge naturally
**Stress reduces:** Less energy spent on protection means more available for living

### Building a Connected Life Architecture

**Physical Environment:**
- Create spaces that invite relaxation and openness
- Remove or minimize things that trigger defensive responses
- Surround yourself with reminders of connection (photos, art, plants)

**Social Environment:**
- Gradually spend more time with people who appreciate your authentic self
- Set boundaries with relationships that require you to be perpetually defensive
- Seek out communities aligned with your values

**Mental Environment:**
- Practice meditation or mindfulness to develop awareness of your thought patterns
- Read books and consume content that reinforces connection over separation
- Limit exposure to media that promotes fear and division

## 🚀 Your Next Steps

### Week 1: Awareness Building
- Notice when you feel most open and connected
- Identify your top three defensive patterns
- Practice the morning check-in daily

### Week 2: Small Experiments
- Try one new way of connecting each day
- Share something genuine with someone you trust
- Practice receiving compliments without deflecting

### Week 3: Expanding Comfort Zones
- Engage in a conversation you'd normally avoid
- Express a preference or opinion you usually keep hidden
- Ask for help with something small

### Week 4: Integration
- Reflect on what you've learned about yourself
- Identify which practices felt most natural
- Design your ongoing connection practice

## 🌟 The Deeper Truth

What you're really doing isn't learning something foreign or adopting a new belief system. You're simply removing the barriers to what was already there. That capacity for connection, curiosity, and openness never left – it just got covered up by layers of learned protection.

Every time you choose to stay present instead of checking out, express appreciation instead of criticism, or lead with curiosity instead of defensiveness, you're not becoming someone new. You're remembering who you've always been underneath it all.

The beautiful thing about this approach is that it works regardless of your background, beliefs, or life circumstances. Connection is a universal human capacity. The specific ways you express it will be uniquely yours, but the underlying ability belongs to everyone.

### The Ripple Effect Legacy

As you reconnect with your natural state of openness, you give others permission to do the same. Your children, friends, colleagues, and even strangers you encounter briefly are influenced by your presence. They unconsciously think, ""Oh, it's safe to be real here. It's okay to let my guard down a little.""

This is how change spreads – not through force or persuasion, but through example. One person choosing connection over protection creates space for others to do the same.

## 🎯 Final Thoughts: The Lifelong Practice

This journey back to connection isn't a destination you arrive at once and then you're done. It's a daily choice, a moment-by-moment practice of choosing openness when your instinct might be to close off.

Some days will be easier than others. Some interactions will feel natural and flowing, others will challenge every protective instinct you have. This is normal and expected.

The key is consistency, not perfection. Each time you choose connection over protection, you strengthen that neural pathway. Each genuine interaction, each moment of vulnerability, each choice to stay present instead of checking out builds your capacity for authentic living.

Remember: you're not trying to become someone different. You're simply returning home to who you've always been, underneath all the learned layers of protection. And that person – that open, curious, naturally connecting person – has been waiting for you to remember them all along.

Your authentic self is your gift to the world. The world needs what you have to offer, but only you can choose to offer it.

Nope. He was dead serious. The twist? He’s *currently engaged*. I only found out because one of my friends sent me screenshots from his fiancée’s Instagram that same morning — she had just posted about their upcoming wedding shower.

When I confronted him, he said, “I just needed to know if you’d say yes, because then I’d know what to do.” Like my answer was supposed to dictate whether he cancels his wedding.

I walked out. Haven’t spoken to him since. But the wildest part is that his fiancée DMed me later that night… asking if I “led him on” because now he’s “having doubts.”",5,1756482933.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

 ( u/master_of_nothing96  )What began as a small misunderstanding quickly turned into bans, ego fights, and outright harassment.
(Story condensed into short, readable paras)

At first I was banned for no reason u/cylerprime  spoke up for me, called out the mod’s ego, and he got banned too Later things sorted with  @master_of_nothing96  I became a mod for 3 days I tried to be fair, kept asking to unban u/cylerprime , denied continuously so gave u/cylerprime another chance through a second ID But instead of seeing that they twisted it against me!

Then there’s u/bigbrownchhora (the double faced jealous jerk) inactive the whole time I was MOD but suddenly showed up at the meetup with a lame STANDARD plan (‘let’s play cards “RUMMY” at Coffee Sutra’) when we refused, he ditched midway to hang with his boys and later went behind my back to bitch about me, and only fueled the MOD ( u/master_of_nothing96 )against me saying the meetup was bad while out of six people there only ( u/bigbrownchhora )remarked the meetup bad!

After that, I was banned again without any discussion. Then came the worst part abusive calls and voice notes from u/master_of_nothing96 He attacked my character,Family status and even dragged my friends,saying they ‘have no standards’ just because they didn’t fight him (jaise wo bol ra tha yaha aaja waha aaja n stuff ifykyk). Yes, I answered back at times, but the level of abuse he kept throwing was something no woman should ever face.

This whole thing left me shaken. I wasn’t just banned I was humiliated, targeted, and made to feel unsafe in a space meant for community. As a woman, being abused, having my friends and Parents dragged in, and being silenced just for standing my ground was painful. No one deserves this, and I’m sharing my story so others see the kind of harassment women face even online.
Strong women speak up weak men can’t handle it No woman should ever be treated like this by anyone!

It’s a sleek combination of a mini food processor and coffee grinder that manages to perfectly fit into the compact chaos of my countertop-free home. There are plenty of good things about this gadget, but some quirks might make you think twice before diving in.

**Streamlined Design for Tight Spaces**  
I initially got hooked on the concept of an under-cabinet-mounted food processor simply because I hate clutter. The Black+Decker CG800B Spacemaker nailed this feature. Its compact size (just 9.65 x 8.07 x 5.51 inches) coupled with the under-the-cabinet setup is a gem, especially since my kitchen could double as a broom closet. Every time I prepare a meal or grind coffee, I find myself enjoying that newfound clearance on my countertop. Also, the black finish blends in seamlessly with my appliances, keeping things looking cohesive and modern.

**Check Black+Decker CG800B Spacemaker price on Amazon.**

**Functional Versatility for Daily Use**  
This isn't just a food processor—it’s coffee grinder territory too, something I never thought I'd appreciate so much. The two included blades—a stainless-steel one for chopping food and another for grinding beans—are genuinely sharp and durable. I’ve pulsed everything from hard nuts to herbs and even ground enough coffee for guests. The pulse control offers just the right consistency I need for both food and coffee. Plus, having two containers (a metal-bottomed one and another with a rubberized lid) is oddly satisfying because I don’t need to wash them mid-task when switching between ingredients.

**Craftsmanship and Ease of Maintenance**  
I have to hand it to the developers here—this device feels sturdy. Weighing just 3.4 pounds, it’s lightweight enough to maneuver but robust enough to stay stationary while working. While I’m not thrilled that it requires handwashing, the detachable components make cleaning straightforward and manageable. Ugh, why does my dishwasher always feel neglected anytime I get these types of appliances?  

**Good Points**  
- Mounts under cabinets, saving valuable kitchen counter space.  
- Dual functionality as a coffee grinder and food processor.  
- Two sharp stainless-steel blades included for food prep and coffee grinding.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Cleaning can be cumbersome since it’s not dishwasher-safe.  
- Limited capacity—works best for smaller portions or single servings.  
- Mounting it to cabinets might be tricky if you’re not naturally handy.  

**Peer Products**  
When pitted against similar gadgets like the Cuisinart Mini Prep Pro or Ninja’s Kitchen System, the Black+Decker CG800B wins slightly on space-saving with its under-cabinet mounting. It doesn’t win out on sheer power, with competitors like Ninja packing a lot more punch for larger portions or tougher items. However, those options are bulkier and require dedicated space on your counter. Plus, very few alternative products come with the dual coffee-grinding addition, an extremely convenient feature for any morning multitasker.  

**Affordable Quality**  
For a relatively low investment, this nifty device does a fairly good job meeting its promise. Sure, there are models with larger capacities and functions, but they usually come at a steeper price. This one feels like a decent middle ground for compact simplicity. If simplicity and saving counter space reign supreme on your wishlist, you’ll likely appreciate the value in this unit.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Oklahoma vs. Illinois State: A Tale of Two Tailgates (and a Lopsided Spread)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a football spectacle so lopsided, even the referees might pack up and go home after the first quarter. The Oklahoma Sooners, fresh off their decision to shorten tailgating from a 12-hour endurance test to a mere five-hour “casual hangout,” face off against Illinois State in Norman, Oklahoma. Let’s break this down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a drunk uncle at a family reunion.

### Parsing the Odds: Why Oklahoma’s Spread Feels Like a Math Test

The line is a staggering **36.5-point spread** in Oklahoma’s favor. For context, that’s like betting your neighbor’s cat will outlive your New Year’s resolution. Converting the decimal odds (1.87 for Oklahoma, 1.95 for Illinois State) gives Oklahoma an implied probability of **\~53%** to win, while Illinois State checks in at **\~51%**—a statistical paradox akin to claiming a rock is the underdog in a race against a sloth.

Why such a gap? Oklahoma’s recent FCS dominance reads like a horror movie: **253 points scored, 28 allowed** since 2019. Illinois State, meanwhile, lost its last two FBS games by a combined **78-0**. If football were a job interview, Oklahoma would be the CEO with a golden handshake, and Illinois State would be the intern still learning how to use a coffee machine.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, QBs, and Tailgate Time

Oklahoma’s new QB, **John Mateer**, is a transfer from Washington State with 3,139 yards and 29 TDs under his belt. Coach Brent Venables is so confident, he might as well be betting his entire paycheck on this game. But the Sooners are missing key pieces: defensive backs, receivers, and a running back (Jaydn Ott) who’s “limited.” It’s like bringing a toaster to a barbecue—functional, but not exactly crowd-pleasing.

_Never interrupt your enemy when they are making a mistake._ 

Yay for grey rocking!

Some snippets:

> The word “Meghan” once sparked fury in senior members of the Royal family. But now it surely warrants merely a snigger, sometimes coffee spat out at the breakfast table as the belly wobbles in a fit of giggles, rather than fear and loathing.

""Meghan"" is a four-letter word. And the butt of many jokes. 

> And the mirth is so much sweeter because there was a time when these outpourings needed to be taken seriously. The Royal family was quaking, every hiss and yelp from Meghan and her husband Harry was dispatched to constitutional experts for analysis and counsel.

The F*cking Grifters threw a giant tantrum, and like all good parents, the BRF put their ass in time out. 

> At the time we wondered if our monarchy would survive it, we pitied the late Queen having to witness family relations disintegrating at her feet, each morsel fed out relentlessly to the media.

There is no culture in the world where harassing and upsetting Grandma is acceptable. Hank, I expect trashy behavior from your starter wife, because, well, she's trash. But _you_ know better.

> But that was all way back when. Way back when Meghan’s ambitions worried British Royals and loyal British subjects, as her ambitions suggested a looming, never-ending threat to The Firm.

> Now, with her latest series of With Love and and the inevitable royal reflections, she seems to have gone properly bonkers. So successful has the “unresolved trauma” therapy that she and Harry so espouse been, that she has now crafted a whole new absurdist memory of that short period between her marriage to Harry in May 2018 and the January 2020 Megxit rebrand.

> The idea of princesses being constrained in royal palaces, ordered to wear specific tights and hairbands, aside from the hope they be normal and nice to the staff, is the stuff of fairy tales.

Every job has rules and regulations. One would think an ""actress"" would know there is a difference between private and public life, and how to adjust accordingly.

But wait, the world's greatest fauxminist wanted to modernize the monarchy. By taking off her pantyhose. 🤣🤯

> It’s laughable, potty garbage. And, knowing that, as we head to the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness is, for King and country, such sweet, restful bliss.

Narkle has proven she is an absolute idiot. She thinks she's playing chess, but in reality, the f*cking grifter is playing Candyland. 

Stupid Narkle just couldn't keep her Chiclets together. She's been own goal-ing herself for years, without any assistance from the BRF. And now the world knows just how truly awful the narcissistic harpy is.

As Narkle's BFF Ozemprah loves to say, quoting Maya Angelou, _When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time_.

I believe you, Narkle! 😘",46,1756482769.0,SaintMeghanMarkle,14,1.0,False
1n3b57e,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDreamAcademy/comments/1n3b57e/wait_two_groups_how_why_money_the_answer_is/,"Wait, Two Groups? How? Why? (money. the answer is always money.)","In light of all the ""they're trying to replace Katseye!"" or ""this was the group they REALLY wanted, not Katseye!"" takes, let me offer the perspective from marketing that neither of those is the case, and Katseye's success is why the Prelude group exists.

This is all just my opinion, not facts, just from my understanding of how business works behind the scenes. 

*No one* is going to invest in a second global girl group if the first global girl group isn't successful. Katseye did well with ""Touch,"" and then had to prove it wasn't a fluke with their next comeback. While there are fair critiques of Gnarly and how they don't have a specific sound yet, Gnarly and Gabriela have done fantastically (I heard Gabriela in a coffee shop yesterday, and even Gnarly won me over). HxG proved to investors that a global girl group can succeed, so investors were easier to recruit.

Also, I'm not sure Prelude Group will be overlapping much with Katseye. Their visuals suggest that their sound may be more dreamy/laidback, and the focus on a Japanese member suggests that their audience may be more J-Pop adjacent rather than K-Pop-adjacent like Katseye.

**Why Samara/Emily/Lexie?**

I am going to say that I think this producer's[ perspective of them testing two potential groups](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDreamAcademy/comments/1m10w6b/comment/n3gyj78/), one formed around Manon and one around Lexie, seems extremely likely--especially now! I'm not a producer for the record but their points stood out as pretty consistent with the business side, and  explained  a lot of the group divisions for missions as well. And now that this group has been announced this person needs their flowers!  

So from the start HxG had open plans for the group, which is smart because you never know how the market will change.

Some of the girls are kind of obvious fits for either the Manon or Lexie group--Megan as the vocalist for Manon, Samara for Lexie; Daniela as the main dancer for Manon, Emily for Lexie. Lara I'm not sure about, though--I really don't know if they would have swapped Lara for Ezrela based nothing but an Indian background. It's possible, but their skills do not overlap a ton so I'm not convinced. But I do think Ezrela had a chance with this group. 

I also think people like Sophia and Yoonchae are concept-versatile, and Sophia would have been a lock either way. While I do think originally Nayoung was intended to be the Korean member in a Manon group and Yoonchae with a Lexie group, they also realized Yoonchae could pull off a more mature concept, and so it wasn't devastating when Nayoung left (a Korean member was guaranteed from the start).

But, after Samara's controversy and Lexie's departure, this group was essentially DOA... but, they have also invested money in these girls (and the others). If they can do something with that investment, they will. But as things stood at the end of DA, HxG had to see if Katseye would work at all first, because for all they knew Katseye could flop and then all that investment into everyone is gone. 

**Why now?** 

As I said earlier, I think Katseye's success proved to investors this could work. Two years also gives Samara's controversy time to die down and gives her time to actually grow from it (kinda doubt that personal growth was the priority for the company, but still true). It also gave them time to think about if they wanted to find a new ""star power"" center or woo Lexie back. 

In the meantime, though, very few girls are going to just sit around waiting for something that might or might not happen, because there was no guarantee. So most moved on and some may have received offers to join, but have their own lives now and don't want to uproot them again. 

About Lexie, I have no clue what they offered her to get her back. Probably promises and guarantees that there was not going to be any trickery this time. And I don't think she's a hypocrite for wanting to be an artist and giving them a second chance. Because the reality is that they need *her* for this group. 

**Why not Marquise/Ezrela/Nayoung?**

Unfortunately watching DA/the Netflix series made me wonder if they really were keen on Marquise or Ezrela, which is annoying because Ezrela was one of my favorites and Marquise is a star. I hope they offered both of them options and they turned them down (especially Ezrela because she fits the image of the group), but who knows. 

Marquise received a fair degree of criticism in the brief commentary clip from the third mission before the third elimination; one of the evaluators literally said: ""[she has charms, but I can't seem them on the team](https://youtu.be/E1_syEmpLus?t=175)."" It sounded like his mind was made up even if the others' were open to her.

In the clip shown in the Netflix show about the final decision meeting, one of the executives said something to the effect of ""it's crazy Ezrela's here in the final considering where we started,"" which kinda seemed like they may not have been seriously considering her, especially not after Lexie left. 

I'd also say that if Lexie hadn't dropped out, one of them would not have made it to the finale. And if Nayoung didn't say that one thing to Missy, it's entirely possible that neither Marquise nor Ezrela would have. They weren't going to dismiss Emily or Samara (as much as people wanted them to). Maybe they would have had 12 people in the finale--that'd be ideal, but I don't know. I think 10 is very possibly what they had decided on. 

I really don't buy the conspiracy theory that Nayoung never said the thing about a solo artist to Missy, though. It'd be ridiculous for HxG to dismiss the best singer who had great popularity just because what, they're worried she's too good for them? Companies want money above all else. She had a close relationship with Manon. She was a fan favorite, and the top singer. She matched the image of a Manon-centered group perfectly. 

Now, did Nayoung *mean* that, or was she just getting cold feet and having normal anxiety when you're on the verge of your life about to change and maybe worded it poorly? We can't know. It's *very* possible it was the latter.

However, a survival show is not a school. It's a job interview. If you go into a job interview, even as the top candidate, and say ""I have some second thoughts,"" no company will hire you. So as much as I love Nayoung, I get that's why they dismissed her.

Anyways, those are my thoughts. I am excited for the new group (cautious about Samara but giving her the benefit of the doubt for now; I hope she's been encouraged to explore Indian culture and all its amazingness) and if Ezrela and Marquise ever debut, I'll be there too.

1n3b4vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkplaceSafety/comments/1n3b4vb/pesticide_use_in_office/,Pesticide use in office,"My husband was drinking his morning coffee at work out of his usual cup and someone said something like ""did you wash that cup before drinking out of it, they sprayed pesticides last night?"". There was no notice given to him or his team that this was happening. Turns out the email notification only went to a specific group of employees which his team is not a part of. The email said they have bugs in the office and will be spraying, so take home or store coffee cups etc so it doesn't get sprayed, and to take home jackets or blankets and don't bring them back. He left his jacket out as well as his coffee cup. The person who sent the email sits right next to him and didn't mention it. His own supervisor didn't mention a thing about it either.

My husband may have and probably did drink some amount of pesticide but it probably can't be measured or proven at this point and his jacket surely absorbed some as well. They had moved his jacket do a different spot than where he left it, so he knows they (or someone) was at his desk. I feel like this is an OSHA general duty clause issue, but don't know what could come of it or what he should do if anything.

1n3b36f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lagerfeuer/comments/1n3b36f/der_wahlhelfer/,Der Wahlhelfer,"Linda öffnete den Brief, auf dem in ziervoller Handschrift ihr Name stand. Darunter kam eine Einladungskarte zum Vorschein, designt gerade auf der Grenze zwischen edel und kitschig. Zwei rosa Herzen waren darauf zu sehen, die in der Mitte verschmolzen. *Wir heiraten! Herzliche Einladung zum schönsten Tag im Leben von Karo und Jonathan!*

Sie blickte verdutzt auf die Karte in ihren Händen. Das hatte sie nicht erwartet. Nicht nach all den anstrengenden, Nachmittage füllenden Diskussionen.

*„Ich weiß es doch nicht!“*

*„Was soll das heißen: Du weißt es nicht? Wer soll das denn sonst wissen? Hier geht es doch ausschließlich um Dich und Deine Gefühle, Karo!“*

*„Ja, ich weiß. Aber es ist so schwierig!“*

*„Was ist denn genau schwierig?“*

*„Na, alles!“*

*„Und was zum Beispiel?*

*„Also – zum Beispiel das Haus. Ich würde wirklich gerne hier wohnen bleiben. Aber Jona klingt immer, als wäre er davon nicht so überzeugt.“*

*„Was sagt er denn?“*

*„Naja – schon, dass er einziehen möchte. Aber manchmal klingt er so komisch dabei. Und ich weiß ja auch, wie sehr er an seinen Freunden aus der Uni hängt. Dann kann er die ja gar nicht mehr besuchen.“*

*„Er braucht dann halt ein bisschen länger zu ihnen – meine Güte…“*

*„Ja, genau, und ich bin schuld.“*

*„Das lass doch seine Sorge sein. Werde besser Du Dir sicher darüber, was Du willst.“*

*„Wenn Du meinst. Aber es ist so schwierig!“*

Linda hatte sich an diesem Punkt schon oft ein lautes Seufzen verkniffen. Es war einfach hoffnungslos gewesen. Wie oft mochte sie mit Karo schon über dieses Thema diskutiert haben? Sie konnte sich kaum mehr an Konversationen erinnern, in denen es nicht um Jonathan gegangen war. Die beiden waren seit drei, vier Jahren zusammen, und jede Entscheidung, die Karo in dieser Zeit hatte fällen müssen und die sich irgendwie auf ihre gemeinsame Zukunft bezogen hatte, hatte sie in stundenlangen, mühseligen Diskussionen vor Linda ausgebreitet – nur um jedes Mal zu dem Schluss zu gelangen, eine wirklich gute Lösung sei nicht möglich: Sie solle ihr doch ihren Rat geben und sie so erlösen.

Auch früher schon, erinnerte sich Linda, hatte es solche Situationen gegeben, doch in letzter Zeit hatten sie sich eindeutig gehäuft. Vielleicht hatte es daran gelegen, dass mit dem Ende von Karos Studium nun ein ganz neuer Lebensabschnitt bevorstand. Sie würde sich von einigen alten Sicherheiten verabschieden müssen. Offensichtlich hatte ihr diese Vorstellung bisher überhaupt nicht behagt.

Umso seltsamer war jetzt dieser plötzliche Tatendrang. Nun, immerhin würde es in Zukunft vielleicht endlich andere Gesprächsthemen geben, dafür war Linda auf jeden Fall dankbar. Bei ihrem letzten Treffen, fiel ihr nun ein, hatte Karo ihr erzählt, sie sei jetzt in Therapie.

*„Also nicht wirklich Therapie, ich hab ja keine Schraube locker oder so“*, hatte sie schnell ergänzt.

*„Es ist mehr so eine Art Beratung für schwierige Entscheidungen. Mein Onkel war da letztens auch, wegen seiner Hüft-OP, weißt Du? Jahrelang hat er damit gerungen, ob er sie machen lassen soll oder nicht. Aber dann war er zwei-, dreimal dort und hat auf einmal ganz selbstbewusst seine Entscheidung gefällt.“*

*„Ist er jetzt operiert?“*

*„Nein. Aber er hat auch nie wieder darüber nachgedacht, sagt er. Er wirkt richtig befreit. Vielleicht kann mir der Berater auch helfen.“*

Mehr aus Skepsis an dieser Art von Wunderheilung als aus Interesse hatte Linda die Visitenkarte des Beraters, die ihre Freundin ihr stolz gezeigt hatte, damals mit dem Handy abfotografiert. Jetzt holte sie das Foto wieder heraus. Konnte dieser Mann wirklich innerhalb einer Woche das vollbracht haben, was ihr selbst in Monaten, vielleicht Jahren von Gesprächen nicht gelungen war? Das interessierte sie brennend. War es ein meisterhafter Psychotherapeut? Oder eher ein undercover agierender Privatdetektiv, der seinen Klienten bisher verborgene Informationen lieferte? Aber was hätte der Karos Onkel und seiner Hüft-OP geholfen?

Linda verspürte das dringende Verlangen, dieser Sache auf den Grund zu gehen. Sie hatte genug von gefährlichen Sekten gehört, die ihren Mitgliedern mit seltsamen Techniken Selbstvertrauen einflößten und dafür massenhaft Geld von ihnen abzapften.

Noch am selben Tag fuhr sie in die Stadt und suchte das Büro des „Wahlhelfers“, wie es auf der Visitenkarte hieß. Es befand sich in einem der schöneren Viertel, in einem Haus, das wohl auf hunderte Jahre Geschichte zurückblicken konnte und doch komfortabel renoviert aussah. Das Geschäft schien gut zu laufen, was Linda in ihrem Verdacht noch bestärkte. Ein goldenes Schild neben der Tür verriet ihr, dass sich das Büro im zweiten Stock befand.

Kurz bevor sie dort angelangt war, kam ihr aus dem Gang, in dem sich das Büro des Beraters befinden musste, ein älterer Herr entgegen. Er strahlte über das ganze Gesicht und bedankte sich noch im Gehen überschwänglich bei demjenigen, der sich drinnen aufhielt und bei dem er augenscheinlich gerade eine sehr erfolgreiche Sitzung abgeschlossen hatte. Der Mann und Linda gaben sich die Klinke in die Hand.

Nun stand sie in einem kleinen, stilvoll eingerichteten Vorzimmer. Sie klopfte an den Türrahmen einer schweren, hölzernen Tür, die noch halb offenstand und den Blick in das eigentliche Büro teilweise freigab.

„Herein!“

Sie betrat den Raum und drehte sich nach rechts. Dort, hinter der Tür, saß ein Mann mittleren Alters in einem beigen Anzug auf einem Bürostuhl und packte gerade seine Tasche, augenscheinlich im Begriff zu gehen.

„Oh, Verzeihung“, sagte er, nachdem er, erschreckt durch Lindas plötzliche Anwesenheit, kurz zusammengefahren war, „Ich dachte, ich hätte schon alle Termine für heute Vormittag erledigt. Setzen Sie sich doch kurz und sagen Sie mir bitte Ihren Namen. Vielleicht habe ich Sie…“

„Sie haben mich nicht vergessen. Entschuldigen Sie bitte, dass ich so spontan hereinplatze. Hätten Sie vielleicht kurz Zeit, um mit mir zu sprechen?“ Sie hatte sich auf dem Weg überlegt, dass es wohl am einfachsten war, sich als interessierte potenzielle Kundin auszugeben.

Der Wahlhelfer steckte seinen kleinen, schwarzen Kalender wieder in die Tasche seines Jacketts und antwortete: „Sie haben Glück, normalerweise habe ich keine Zeit für spontane Sitzungen und nehme nur Anmeldungen per Telefon an. Aber für dreizehn Uhr ist vorhin eine Dame abgesprungen. Sie sagte, es habe sich schon erledigt. Passiert öfter. Ich würde Sie, Frau –“

„Jakobi.“

„ – Frau Jakobi, nur kurz bitten, zu warten, bis ich von der Mittagspause wiederkomme. Ich habe heute noch kaum etwas gegessen.“

Der Wahlhelfer musterte Linda eine halbe Sekunde länger, als ihr lieb war. Hatte er ihr eigentliches Anliegen schon durchschaut? Wusste er vielleicht sogar schon, wer sie war? Wenn er wirklich ein Privatdetektiv war und Karo ihm von ihr erzählt hatte…?

„Natürlich, kein Problem. Ich habe Zeit.“

„Dann warten Sie doch gerne hier im Büro. Ich werde nicht lange brauchen.“ 

Schnell drehte er sich um, schloss die Tür hinter sich, und schon war sie völlig allein im Zimmer. Einen Augenblick lang, während sie von fern noch seine Schritte unten auf der Treppe und dann das Zufallen der Haustür hörte, verharrte sie etwas verloren zwischen Schreibtisch und Couch, dann setzte sie sich auf einen Stuhl, der seitlich an der Wand stand. Sie wollte in dieser Szenerie nicht den Platz einer Patientin einnehmen. Dafür war sie schließlich nicht hierhergekommen.

Linda sah sich um. Der Raum war in gedeckten, dunklen Grüntönen gehalten, eingerichtet mit altmodischen Möbeln aus Eichenholz und dem wuchtigen, reich verzierten Schreibtisch des Wahlhelfers, der rötlich schimmerte und wohl aus etwas noch Edlerem bestand. Irgendetwas aus den Tropen wahrscheinlich.

Das Licht, das nur spärlich durch die kleinen Fenster schien, wurde noch gedämpft durch einige große Zimmerpflanzen mit riesigen, palmenhaften Blättern. Das ganze Ambiente, so fand sie, strahlte eine gewisse Althergebrachtheit und Autorität aus. Sie konnte sich gut vorstellen, warum ihre Freundin sich so sicher war, hier kompetent beraten zu werden. Linda selbst allerdings fühlte sich eingeengt und wenig willkommen.

Als sie aufstand, um zumindest ein Fenster zu kippen, erhaschte sie einen genaueren Blick auf den Schreibtisch. Ein kleiner Ordner lag offen darauf. Schon wieder musste sich sie über diesen tollen Berater ärgern. So ging er also mit den vertraulichen Daten seiner Klienten um!

Als sie einen Schritt nähertrat, erkannte Linda, dass die Dokumente wohl zu dem älteren Herrn gehörten, der vor einigen Minuten das Büro verlassen hatte. Wobei „Dokumente“ zu viel gesagt war – zwei hastig handschriftlich beschriebene Zettel waren in den Ordner geheftet, außerdem ein einzelner, amtlich anmutender Vertrag.

Neugierig trat sie hinter den Schreibtisch, um weiterzulesen. Unter normalen Umständen hätte sie dem Drang wohl nicht nachgegeben, aber in diesem Fall: Sollte sich ihr Verdacht der Halsabschneiderei wirklich bewahrheiten, so tat sie dem armen Kerl ja lediglich einen Gefallen! Dieser Vertrauensbruch war im Verhältnis zu dem, was hier möglicherweise gespielt wurde, doch verschwindend gering.

Die Notizen des Wahlhelfers waren schnell durchgelesen. Kaum etwas Aufschlussreiches stand dabei. Der Klient hatte irgendeine Entscheidung über eine Erbschaft gefällt, das ließ sich den Aufzeichnungen entnehmen. Aber ansonsten? Keine Ergebnisse metikulöser detektivischer Ermittlungen oder auch nur einer erschöpfenden Internet-Recherche. Das konnte doch nicht alles sein! Aus irgendetwas musste der Berater doch seine sicheren Schlüsse ziehen, die ihn so gelassen über das Leben anderer Leute bestimmen ließen! Der Vertrag schließlich enthielt überhaupt keine weiteren Informationen. In ihm erklärte der Wahlhelfer lediglich in knappen Worten, er übernehme die Verantwortung für alle Entscheidungen des Klienten nach der Beratung. Ein seltsames Versprechen. Wie konnte sich dieser Mensch nur dermaßen anmaßend überschätzen? Und wer ließ sich auf so etwas ein?

Lindas Blick wanderte nach unten. Nur eine der Schubladen hatte ein geeignetes Format für diesen Ordner. Sie warf einen kurzen Blick über die Schulter zur Tür, lauschte einige Sekunden angestrengt, und als sie sich sicher war, für den Moment ungestört zu sein, zog sie das Schubfach vorsichtig einen Spaltbreit auf.

Treffer.

Hier gab es einen ganzen Stapel von Heftern, die dem aufgeschlagenen auf der Tischfläche in Farbe und Größe entsprachen und mit den Namen aller Klientinnen und Klienten beschriftet waren. Es war eine erkleckliche Anzahl, aber schon der erste Blick ließ sie erkennen, dass auch diese Ordner alle nicht mehr als eine Handvoll Blätter enthielten. Bei einem davon machte sie sich noch die Mühe, ihn zu öffnen und durchzublättern, aber es waren wieder nur ganz banale, grobe Umrisse einer 08/15-Beziehungsgeschichte, wie schon in Karos Fall.

Linda schob den Hefter vorsichtig wieder genau an seinen Platz im Stapel und dachte angestrengt nach. Einen Computer schien es im Büro überhaupt nicht zu geben. Vielleicht benutzte der Wahlhelfer aber heimlich einen und hielt seine Erkenntnisse dort versteckt? Und wenn ja: Welchen Sinn hatte das?

Als der Herr im Anzug eine Viertelstunde später wieder in sein Büro zurückkehrte, in der einen Hand einen großen Coffee To Go, in der anderen ein belegtes Brot vom Bäcker, saß sie schon lange wieder auf ihrem Stuhl und zeigte ihre beste Unschuldsmiene.

Der Wahlhelfer nahm am Schreibtisch Platz, was Linda dazu veranlasste, sofort ihre Position zu wechseln. Sie wollte nicht die seltsamen Beratungssitzungen nachstellen, die hier anscheinend täglich stattfanden. Stattdessen stellte sie sich mit aller Autorität, die sie hier, in diesem fremden Büro zusammenkratzen konnte, direkt vor dem Schreibtisch auf.

„Ich habe Ihre Notizen angeschaut“, entfuhr es ihr, noch ehe sie sich besonnen hatte. Was dieser Betrüger hier tat, wog deutlich schwerer als der gerechtfertigte Vertrauensbruch.

„Das war nicht sehr höflich von Ihnen, aber erwartbar. Ich wäre ehrlich gesagt erstaunter gewesen, Sie hätten wirklich um meine Hilfe gebeten. So wirken Sie nicht, Fr. Jakobi. Haben Sie übrigens etwas Interessantes herausgefunden?"", entgegnete der Mann hinter dem Schreibtisch unbeeindruckt.

„Sie verarschen die Leute doch bloß! Sie haben nicht die geringste Grundlage für ihre Aussagen!“

„Das stimmt so nicht ganz, Frau Jakobi. Ich weiß doch immerhin das, was meine Klienten mir erzählen.“

„Die wissen es auch nicht besser – deswegen kommen sie doch zu Ihnen!“

„Ganz genau, Frau Jakobi. Sie verstehen das Prinzip schon. Nehmen Sie zum Beispiel Ihre Freundin, Frau Reinhart – jetzt bald Schiller, wenn ich das richtig sehe.“

„Die Sie um ihr Geld bringen!“

„Der ich helfe. Sie hat doch wohl ziemlich oft mit Ihnen über ihre Entscheidungen gesprochen?“

„Über ihre Nicht-Entscheidungen, meinen Sie wohl. Und ja, natürlich hat sie das. Sie kennt ja fast kein anderes Thema. Ich weiß auch gar nicht, warum ich mit Ihnen darüber reden sollte. Das ist privat und geht Sie nichts an.“

„Frau Reinhart hat mir schon ausführlich von all diesen Themen erzählt. Ich bezweifle ernsthaft, dass Sie mir etwas sagen könnten, was ich noch nicht gehört habe. Aber ich verstehe Ihre Skepsis. Bleiben wir also ganz allgemein. Sie hat sich lange Zeit geweigert, eine Entscheidung über ihre private Zukunft, soll heißen, Ihren Lebenspartner zu fällen. Woran liegt das, Frau Jakobi, Ihrer Meinung nach?“

„Sie hat immer gesagt, es gäbe so viele Unsicherheiten zu bedenken. Und dann haben wir meistens über irgendeine Sorge diskutiert, die sie hatte. Sie muss sich unfassbar viele Nächte mit diesen Sorgen und irgendwelchen Horrorszenarien um die Ohren geschlagen haben. Manchmal hatte ich sogar das Gefühl, sie vertraut ihrem Freund gar nicht und spioniert ihm ab und zu nach, um sich sicherer zu sein.“

„Na also! Und da glauben Sie, es könnte irgendjemanden geben, der hier noch mehr Wissen für die Entscheidung zutage fördern könnte? Einen Analysten oder Ermittler? Nein, Frau Jakobi, darum geht es doch wahrlich nicht. Was zu durchdenken und herauszufinden ist, haben meine Klienten schon lange durchdacht und herausgefunden. Hunderte, tausende Male. Eine höhere Sicherheit gibt es nicht und kann es auch nicht geben. Ich bin nur der Katalysator, der Geburtshelfer der Entscheidung, wenn Sie so wollen. Das Einzige, womit sich mein Geschäft auseinandersetzt, ist die permanente Angst dieser Menschen.“

„Die Angst, sich entscheiden zu müssen?“

„Exakt. Bedenken sind viel einfacher zu tragen als Verantwortung. Jeder, der das verstanden hat, kann meinen Beruf ergreifen. Ich hatte nur Fantasie genug, um es wirklich zu tun.

Um etwas weiter auszuholen: Früher war ich selbst ein wenig wie Ihre Freundin. Ich hatte regelrechte Panik vor Entscheidungen. Ich hätte ja etwas falsch entscheiden können. Und dann wäre ich schuld an den Konsequenzen gewesen. Also hielt ich mich zurück, und die Dinge wurden über meinen Kopf hinweg entschieden. Das war einerseits angenehm, andererseits aber auch unerträglich. Ich war völlig unfrei.

Und eines Tages stellte ich dann eine Rechnung auf. Eine ganz simple. In ihr wog ich meine Optionen gegeneinander ab. Die eine Möglichkeit war, so zu verharren wie bisher. Ich würde mich stets absolut auf andere verlassen, die ich für kompetenter hielt als mich selbst. Oder aber ich stünde für mich und meine Handlungen ein. Dabei konnte viel Schlimmes passieren. Aber selbst, wenn es alles einträte: Wäre es schlimmer, als für immer alle Entscheidungen aus der Hand zu geben?

Die Wahl fiel schließlich, wie Sie heute sehen, auf die letztere Möglichkeit. Es kostete mich zugegebenermaßen einiges an Überwindung, plötzlich die schönen und hässlichen Aspekte des Lebens ganz in meiner Hand zu wissen. Aber ich bezwang mich und räumte einmal richtig auf. Ich zog aus meiner Heimatstadt fort, verließ meine damalige Freundin, brach den Kontakt zu einigen äußerst unangenehmen Familienmitgliedern ab. Ich machte einen Motorradführerschein und ging in ein Bordell – einfach nur, um auch das einmal probiert zu haben.“

Nach einer kurzen Pause, in der er in Erinnerungen zu schwelgen schien, fuhr der Wahlhelfer fort:

„Waren das alles tolle Entscheidungen? Bestimmt nicht. Ich werde Sie nicht mit den Einzelheiten darüber langweilen, was ich im Nachhinein gerne anders gemacht hätte. Wichtig ist: *Ich* habe diese Dinge getan. Ich war endlich der Meister meines Schicksals und ließ mich nicht mehr von Angst fesseln.

Später entdeckte ich dann, dass andere Leute dieselben Probleme durchlebten. Ein gehöriger Prozentsatz der Menschheit scheint sich nie selbst für etwas zu entscheiden. Wenn Sie so wollen, teilt sich die Welt in drei Kategorien von Personen auf:

Erstens gibt es die, die nichts entscheiden, darüber auch nicht groß nachdenken und damit zufrieden sind. Die laufen überall herum, aber berühren mich nicht. Zweitens findet man solche, denen das Entscheiden nicht in die Wiege gelegt ist, die sich aber unter Qualen dazu durchringen müssen – meine Geschichte habe ich Ihnen ja erzählt, und auch meine Klienten gehören fast ausschließlich zu dieser Gruppe. Und drittens gibt es Menschen wie Sie, Frau Jakobi. Solche Glücklichen, für die die Verantwortung für das eigene Leben quasi der Naturzustand ist. Sie sehen mehrere Möglichkeiten vor sich, wählen eine, und danach sind Sie stolz oder ärgern sich über sich selbst, je nachdem, wie die Sache ausgeht. Sie sind nicht dazu geschaffen, die Gleichgültigkeit der ersten und die Mühen der zweiten Gruppe nachzuvollziehen, und das sollten Sie auch gar nicht. Sie dürfen zufrieden sein mit dem, was Sie können. Es ist, ehrlich gesagt, ziemlich beeindruckend.“

„Sie sagen den Leuten also einfach nur, was sie tun sollen – und, wie es sich anhört, komplett aus dem Bauch heraus!“

„Wenn Sie so wollen, ja.“

„Aber was machen Sie, wenn etwas schiefläuft, wozu Sie geraten haben?“

„Ich übernehme die Verantwortung. Schließlich bin ich nicht unfehlbar. Und das gebe ich in meinen Beratungen auch offen zu. Ich kann mit den Konsequenzen leben, weil ich es gelernt habe, und die Leute können es, weil sie sie sich nicht ausgesucht haben. Das befreit ungemein. Aber um ehrlich zu sein, kommt selten jemand wieder, um sich zu beschweren. Ändern lässt sich dann ohnehin nichts mehr.“

Und damit, als ob nun alles geklärt wäre, man sich freundlich die Hand gegeben und sich verabschiedet hätte, drehte er sich um und schritt Richtung Tür.

„Lassen Sie die Tür auf, wenn Sie gehen! Sie können sich ruhig noch etwas länger in meinen Akten umsehen, falls Sie Zweifel haben“, sagte der Wahlhelfer, schon im Weggehen. Und ehe Linda noch etwas erwidern konnte, hatte er das Zimmer auch schon wieder verlassen.

Ein zweites Mal stand sie allein im Büro. Sie sah sich um, ratlos und geknickt. Der ganze Raum und seine Atmosphäre waren eine einzige Farce, ein Schauspiel, um die Leute, die hierherkamen, in Sicherheit zu wiegen. Wenn man den Worten des Beraters Glauben schenkte, wollten sie ja auch nicht mehr als das. Er übernahm alle Verantwortung. Sie sammelte sich bei ihm und füllte als unsichtbare Masse seine Räumlichkeiten. Ein unermesslicher Reichtum, für sensiblere Naturen als Linda wohl direkt in der Luft spürbar, erfüllte das Büro. Oder doch eher eine furchtbare Schuld?

Wenn dem so war, dann wollte der Wahlhelfer sie zumindest nicht tragen. Er war stets befreit und locker, so als ob er seinen eigenen Worten nicht traute. Doch sie traute ihnen. Sie wusste: Würde sie hier sitzen und ihm von ihren Sorgen erzählen, würde er ihr Zusicherungen machen und es ihr schriftlich geben, dass alles gut werden würde, er sei sich da sicher – sie wäre um etwas betrogen, und zwar um etwas durchaus Vorhandenes.

Während Linda ihren Blick ein letztes Mal über den Tropenholzschreibtisch schweifen ließ, kam ihr schließlich doch noch eine Idee: Eine Methode gab es, um die Grundlage des Geschäfts, die ganze Währung, mit der die Arbeit des Wahlhelfers sich beschäftigte, auf die Probe zu stellen. Sie griff in eine der Schubladen.



Als er sich sicher war, dass die unangenehm aufdringliche Dame wieder verschwunden war, betrat der Herr im Anzug sein Büro zum letzten Mal. Sie hatte seine Sachen wohl nicht mehr durchwühlt, wie er zufrieden feststellte. Offensichtlich hatte er sie überzeugt.

Da entdeckte er auf dem Schreibtisch ein einzelnes Blatt, das dort vorher noch nicht gelegen hatte. Und bei näherem Hinsehen erkannte er darin einen seiner eigenen Verträge, wie sie zu Dutzenden in seinen Ordnern steckten. Nur, dass dieser hier eine andere Unterschrift trug als der Rest. Und oben, in der Leerstelle, in die er schon so oft mit ein paar Buchstaben die Gewalt über ganze Existenzen gesetzt hatte, stand sein eigener Name.

I built this application that uses features from different application and combining it with location features. So u have home feed like instagram/facebook users can decide the posts they create to be location based, temporary, permanent, be visible globally. I am using this bitmoji kind of profile icons that users can set on onboarding and even edit it afterwards. Here is actually list of features:
- Home feed like instagram/Facebook.
- Whispers that is like X/Threads so users can post temporary messages that are location based. For example ""Someone wants to grab a coffee?"" So people around u can see that whisper and respond u can set the radius and expiry time so how long u want it to stay there.
- We have spaces where like discord communities can be created people can be invited to join the community or certain communities will be visible to join for the user depending on their location. These spaces will be created by users. Who will be able to moderate. 
- Pulse points are given to users on certain activities similar to snap score. U also recieve pulse points if u attend certain events, seminars etc. also together with pulse points users get animated frames and titles that they can equip with their profile and it is visible to other users. So kind of like an achievement factor. So if u attend a certain event u get that event limited frame and title u can equip.
- U can add friends to which we have as buddies and yea u can text them 
- Also i missed the discover page where with whispers u also have people nearby and recently nearby which is using 30 mins expiry. So u can send those people icebreaker messages that are prewritten and it goes as request to other users if accepted it opens up a proper chat with the other users also u can add them as buddies later.
I might have missed something but yea i hope i was able to convey the idea though. I am not building it as a business currently. Mostly doing it for learning and to get idea of using different libraries and all. So yea its fun building such an app. It has a lot to be built.

Right out of the box, it’s clear this single-serve coffee machine is aimed squarely at people who value convenience, versatility, and a touch of modern tech in their appliances. My experience with the coffee maker has been mostly positive, but it’s not without a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design that Commands a Presence**

It’s hard to ignore the sleek, metallic finish of this coffee maker. Its modern style fits effortlessly into an office or home kitchen setup. Measuring 10.38""D x 14""W x 13.8""H, the machine takes up moderate counter space, but the arrangement is efficient. A full-color LCD touchscreen dominates the front panel, providing a welcoming brightness every morning. It feels well-built, and the silver exterior adds a professional vibe, though the glossy surface does gather fingerprints – nothing a quick wipe can’t fix.

**Performance that Brews for Everyone**

As someone constantly juggling caffeine preferences between coworkers and family, the customizable brewing options are a lifesaver. This machine offers four different brew sizes: 4 oz., 6 oz., 8 oz., and 10 oz. Whether you’re looking for a strong, concentrated shot or a mild, full cup of coffee, there’s something for everyone. The adjustable brew temperature is surprisingly accurate, and I appreciated the attention to detail here. The 90 oz. water reservoir is another standout feature, holding enough water to pump out up to 18 cups before needing a refill. You can imagine how hassle-free a day becomes when refills are infrequent.  

[Check Keurig K155 Office Pro Commercial price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b00dwkehu4/)

**Key Benefits**

- Intuitive touchscreen with customizable temperature settings
- Large water reservoir for extended use  
- Multiple brew sizes for personalized servings  
- Metallic exterior adds a professional touch  

**Features That Stand Out**

While many coffee makers tend to blend into monotony, the Keurig K155 breaks the mold with its DRAIN AND STORE feature. This allows you to easily drain the internal hot water tank, making it convenient for transport or long-term storage. I tested this after a recent office renovation, and it made relocating the unit so much simpler. The touchscreen interface, which supports English, Spanish, and French language preferences, feels like an upgrade I didn’t know I needed. It's icing on the coffee-flavored cake.

**Areas of Concern**

Not every cup of coffee is brewed in paradise. While I’ve grown fond of its features, a couple of things do stick out.  

- It’s noticeably a bit louder than expected when brewing, a small drawback for early mornings when silence is precious.  
- The machine’s weight (~6 pounds) makes it stable, but lifting it for cleaning or relocating isn’t effortless.   

**Competing Products**

During the evaluation process, I compared the Keurig K155 to several alternatives. Machines like the Nespresso Vertuo and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew come to mind. The Nespresso models cater heavily to espresso enthusiasts and shine with their compact design, but they lack the large reservoir and variety of brew sizes that this coffee maker provides. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew offers great versatility with both single-serve and carafe options, but its build feels less premium and lacks the touchscreen interface. If you’re looking for a commercial-grade machine that’s easy to use and makes multiple cups efficiently, the K155 has the edge.

**Bang for the Buck**

Considering the advanced features – a full-color LCD, customizable brew settings, and a mammoth water reservoir – this coffee maker delivers a solid value proposition. While you might pay a bit more for a commercial-grade unit marketed for office environments, the versatility and durable build justify the investment. Sure, it’s not the cheapest around, but the quality and conveniences it offers make it feel well worth the price tag. Instead of overpaying for gimmicky features on competitors’ machines, you get practical tools designed for real-world use here.

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5’10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

Without a one-way vent, that gas builds up, bloats the bag, and risks bursting. Worse, oxygen sneaks in and dulls flavor by breaking down the oils that make coffee taste and smell alive.

The valve solves both problems—it lets CO₂ escape while keeping oxygen out. As a bonus, it’s also a freshness test: squeeze the bag, and if rich aroma comes out, the coffee’s still lively.

In short: the little valve is what makes it possible to store, ship, and sell coffee at its peak instead of stale.",1,1756482511.0,didyouknow,0,1.0,False

I’m sinking and I don’t think I’ve got the energy to ‘just keep swimming’ anymore,"Trigger warning: Lots of negativity below and talk of suicide/self-harm. If that’s something that may affect you please don’t read.

Another warning is that this is really long! I don’t really know what I’m asking and I don’t really know what I want or need from posting this. Maybe it’s just to get it off my chest or to vent as I don’t really know where else to turn tbh (I’ve always felt a bit stupid calling helplines, I need to book an appt in advance for my therapist or doctor and I don’t want to burden my friends)

I’m also totally exhausted and overwhelmed (aren’t we all…?!) so I might not have the time or energy to respond to every comment or message so please only give me your time/comment if you’re okay with not getting a reply!

I (F39, UK) was diagnosed about 4 years ago and I’m basically a textbook example of female ADHD. It shines out of me, I couldn’t be any more fucking ADHD. I’m medicated (Elvanse) and it seemed to work well for a few years but now the difference is almost imperceptible, the main upside these days is that it’s still slightly staving off my hypersomnia and waking me up in the mornings.

So I struggle with all the usual ADHD things… rejection sensitivity, heightened moods and mood swings, intolerance of injustice, anxiety, depression, feeling immature and confused, and so on and so on. It’s never been easy but it’s getting harder and harder. Medication helped, a bit. Therapy helped, a bit. All the goddamn research and learning and answers helped, a bit. But now I’ve tried everything and I feel like I’ve run out of fight.

On the outside I look successful... I have my own business, I’m prolific online, I do talks and my name is known in my field, I spend most of my spare time volunteering, I have a good education, a wonderful family and a pretty home. I should be fine. I used to have bouts of depression and mental health episodes but ultimately I’d be okay. It was always only a blip before and I could work my way out of it.

This isn’t a blip. On the inside I’m wracked with guilt for wasting my privilege and potential. I’m really struggling. It’s been a genuinely horrible couple of years where I’ve lost my father figure, I’m going to lose another parental-adjacent figure within the year. I went through some big traumatic events through my volunteering whilst trying to support the mental health of all the people I lead (these agents made national news). I’ve faced threats to my personal safety/home and been verbally abused by men I’ve never even met before just for representing an animal charity, all whilst feeling like I’m battling the charity to be heard on the other side. I can’t keep up with emails or messages and I’ve come offline because I hate that there are so many people waiting for a reply that I don’t want to encourage anyone to interact more. I’ve gone from confident to scared of everything and my body is breaking down, I’m fainting all the time and have been hospitalised for symptoms of stroke and heart attack. After tests, they said it was stress, but that things need to change before it kills me somehow.

All very dramatic, I know. But I’ve been trying. NHS Scotland has been amazing with their mental health support (generally) and I’ve been using counselling, antidepressants, ‘alternative therapies’ and all the stupid ‘just go for a little walk’-type tips to try and get back on track. But still I can’t find any joy in life. I get invited to things like festivals and I go out of duty but I don’t enjoy them. I smile and I’m funny and friendly and upbeat but it’s all hollow, a mask I’m wearing to make everyone else feel good (which I don’t begrudge, maybe that’s the one thing that feels positive). On the outside, people see photos of me at these things and think that I’m okay. I couldn’t be any less okay.

So I’m hurting, my heart is hurting and my soul is empty. I can’t get joy from anything that I used to love. Maybe I’ll get a fleeting smile or reaction but it’s peripheral. There’s no nourishing happiness or anything that permeates how I feel inside. 

I feel like I’m too sensitive, like the world is too cruel and that I’m not strong enough to deal with living in a world where there is so much suffering. My efforts to help people and animals in need don’t even scratch the surface. Yeah, it makes a difference for that one being but, selfishly, the weight of all the others feels too heavy. I can’t look at the news or social media any more because I just can’t cope with all the relentless sadness. I don’t feel emotionally equipped for any of that.

And then there’s a whole other big weight on top of everything, like a blanket. I guess it’s ’the icing on the cake’ -the financial struggles. When you’re self-employed there’s no support net, when you’re not working you’re simply not making money. My doctors and therapist have told me to take a break but I don’t now how as I’m already getting my services cut off due to unpaid bills. I haven’t been able to pay myself for months because my health was too poor to take on new clients and I’ve been in such a bad state that just showering feels like an epic task. What happened to me? Where did I go wrong? 

I’ve been starting to catch up but now I’m beyond the point of being able to help myself, either mentally or literally; I can’t buy what I need in terms of postage or materials to send out the products that will bring the money in. I’ve maxxed out all my borrowing opportunities and now late payments have ruined whatever my credit score was. I can’t afford food or even just the fuel to get to a shop to buy some. I haven’t had milk in my coffee or fresh fruit/veg for over a week now and I’m eating one meal a day made from random freezer/store cupboard ingredients.

Sorry, that’s a lot of moaning. All of it I guess is just a way to say that I’m tired. I feel like I’m just dealing with relentless bad news or bad luck and I’m trying to tread water but I don’t want to anymore. Every day I fantasise about leaving this world, just putting a stop to everything. I don’t believe in an afterlife but an absence of anything is at least an absence of sadness too.

I keep trying to pull myself out of it and get my life back together then something else happens. Like today… I was expecting some money, I thought I could finally get some milk, some bread, bananas, whatever. But no, I still have about 18p left of my overdraft. Then a guy that I’ve just started seeing (a little bit of hope, finally) breaks things off. I just don’t know why I get hopeful about anything anymore. I must have done something really bloody horrible to spark off all this bad karma!

I’ve tried SO hard to keep going. Every day I wish that I could give up and nope out of existence but I’ve seen the fallout from suicide and I cannot put my loved ones through that. I guess that counts as a good thing but it also feels like I’m trapped. I’ve tried so hard, followed advice, listened and put everything into practice but it’s too much and I’m still sinking. My health and my finances are just getting worse and worse. I can’t get out when all I want to do is to not be here any more. I’m usually great at hiding things and being the strong, funny friend but it’s starting to slip -recently I broke down on a group trip and cried like a baby until becoming catatonic and another time I drank myself into a state I don’t remember and was found by my neighbour outside and covered in cuts from a broken glass. I apologised profusely in the days after these incidents and I’m still embarrassed but I feel like they’re an indication that I’m starting to lose my grip on things in a more serious way.

I don’t know what to do really. I’m almost 40 and I’ve had a good life, I’ve been very lucky and I’ve done things that many people can only dream of. I used to be fun, I had potential and I was relatively conventionally attractive (now when I bump into people they look at me with concern and ask if I’m sick. Like, rude.) I’ve had a good innings but I think I’m done now. I’m trying to hold on but it’s not what I want, I’m doing it out of responsibility.

I know that this will get flagged for that mental health support message. That’s very kind but please don’t worry, I don’t think I’ll do anything rash. I don’t want to because I don’t want to hurt those I care about. I know it’s not a sensible option but I’ve got a bottle of spirits (that I’ve been keeping for sentimental reasons) which I’ve finally opened and I’m going to have a glass of that as a coping tool to take the pain away and numb me a little. If I drink enough I’ll fall asleep and then I’ll wake up tomorrow and feel ashamed for making such a fuss. But I’ll still be alive and won’t have broken the hearts of my loved ones by finally indulging in my need for peace. 

Shit, this is a huge post (and is well over the character limit for where I want to post it. Maybe I’ll put it on my profile)

To whoever might be reading this, I’m sorry for unloading and just spewing out a whole load of negativity.

Here's what actually worked (and the mistakes that almost derailed me),"**Lost 165 lbs over 2 years. Here's what actually worked (and the mistakes that almost derailed me)**

I'm writing this because I wish someone had told me these things when I started. There's so much conflicting advice out there, and I made every mistake in the book before figuring out what actually works.

**Track your weight daily, but don't obsess over daily numbers.** This was huge for me. I used to step on the scale and either celebrate or have a mental breakdown based on that single number. Your weight fluctuates 2-5 pounds daily just from water, food timing, and a million other factors. What matters is the trend over weeks, not the daily drama. I found this app on app store called WeightyAI that basically became my sanity saver - it has this AI check-up button that takes all your weight logs and tells you if you're actually on track despite the daily ups and downs, and even gives you exact calorie adjustments when you get off track. Game changer for staying on track. 

**Stop drinking your calories.** I was consuming like 800 calories a day in ""healthy"" smoothies, fancy coffee drinks, and orange juice. Liquid calories don't make you feel full the same way. Switched to mostly water, black coffee, and the occasional diet soda. Lost 15 pounds in the first month just from this.

**Meal prep is overrated, food prep is underrated.** Everyone talks about spending Sundays making 20 identical chicken and rice containers. I tried it, hated it, gave up. Instead, I prep ingredients: wash and cut vegetables, cook a big batch of protein, make some grains. Then I can throw together different combinations throughout the week without eating the same sad meal five times.

**Your hunger signals are broken (at first).** When you're used to eating 3000+ calories, 1800 feels like starvation even though it's plenty. It takes about 3-4 weeks for your hunger cues to recalibrate. Push through those first few weeks - it genuinely gets easier.

**Cardio is not the answer.** I spent months doing hours of cardio and wondering why I looked ""skinny fat."" Started lifting weights and everything changed. You don't need to become a powerlifter, but some resistance training will make you look and feel so much better as you lose weight.

**Plan for plateaus.** Everyone hits them. I'd go 3-4 weeks with zero change on the scale and want to quit. That's when having something that could analyze my progress objectively was crucial - it would tell me I was still on track and maybe just needed to drop calories by 100 or increase my walking. Having that guidance instead of guessing kept me from making dramatic changes or giving up.

**Social eating is the final boss.** I could stick to my plan perfectly at home, then one dinner with friends would derail me for days. Had to learn that I could enjoy social meals without going completely off the rails. One big meal won't ruin your progress, but the guilt spiral afterward might.

**Take progress photos and measurements.** The scale lies, especially when you're building muscle. I have photos where I'm the same weight but look completely different. Measure your waist, arms, whatever matters to you.

**Sleep matters more than you think.** When I was getting 5-6 hours, I was constantly hungry and craving junk. Started prioritizing 7-8 hours and my appetite regulated itself. Plus I had energy for workouts.

**Find your ""why"" that goes deeper than looks.** Mine was being able to keep up with my kids and not feeling winded going up stairs. When motivation wavered, that kept me going more than wanting to look good in photos.

**Stop making it complicated.** Eat mostly whole foods, stay in a reasonable calorie deficit, move your body regularly, be patient. That's literally it. All the other stuff is just noise.

The biggest thing I learned? This isn't about perfection, it's about consistency. I probably ""messed up"" my plan 2-3 times a week for two years straight. But I kept coming back to it, and that made all the difference.

It’s an old thing, tall and imposing with a heavy, dark wood frame carved with details that are hard to focus on, like leaves and faces that seem to shift when you’re not looking directly at them. I bought it for next to nothing at a cluttered antique shop that was closing down. The old man who sold it to me had a cataract in one eye that made it look like a clouded marble. He just grunted when I asked the price and took my cash without looking at me. I should have seen that as an omen. At the time, I just thought I’d gotten a bargain. I hung it on my bedroom wall, opposite my bed. It made the small room feel bigger. That was my first mistake.

The first sign that something was wrong was subtle. So subtle I thought I was imagining it. You know that feeling when you’re exhausted, when your brain is lagging a half-second behind reality? It was like that. I’d be brushing my teeth in the bathroom, and I’d turn my head. In the reflection, my head would turn a fraction of a second later. A tiny, almost imperceptible delay. A neurological hiccup. I’d shake my head, blame it on lack of sleep, and move on.

But it kept happening. I’d walk past a shop window, and my reflection would take one extra step after I’d already stopped. I’d be on a video call for work, and my own image on the screen would seem to blink just after I did. It was like watching the world on a bad internet connection. A constant, low-level desynchronization that was just enough to put my teeth on edge.

I tried to rationalize it. I told myself it was my brain playing tricks on me, a symptom of stress from my monotonous job. I started taking vitamins. I tried meditating. I forced myself to go to bed earlier. But the lag persisted, a tiny crack in the foundation of my reality.

The first time I felt true, cold-in-your-stomach fear was about three weeks ago. I was getting dressed for the day, standing in front of the antique mirror. I reached for a plain grey t-shirt from my closet. In the mirror, the other Leo—my reflection—reached for a blue one.

I froze. My hand was hovering over the grey shirt. His hand was hovering over a blue one. A blue shirt that I don’t own. I’ve never owned it. I stared, my heart hammering against my ribs like a trapped bird. For a long moment, we were both perfectly still. Then, very slowly, his eyes in the mirror lifted and met mine. And he smiled.

It wasn’t a friendly smile. It was a small, tight, knowing smirk. It was the expression of someone who has a secret, a terrible and wonderful secret. Then, as quickly as it happened, it was over. I blinked, and the reflection was normal again. He was me, hand hovering over the same grey shirt, a neutral, slightly confused expression on his face. My face.

I stumbled back, away from the mirror, my breath coming in ragged gasps. I didn’t get dressed. I called in sick to work and spent the day huddled on my sofa, as far from the bedroom as I could get. I told myself it was a hallucination. A waking dream. It had to be.

But the game had started. And he was the only one who knew the rules.

He began to change things. Small things, at first. I’d be looking in the mirror, and for a split second, my brown eyes would be a piercing, unfamiliar green in the reflection. He’d be wearing a watch on his wrist, a sleek, silver thing I’d never seen before. I’d look down at my own wrist, and it would be bare. When I looked back up, his was bare too. He was testing me. Teasing me.

I tried to fight back. I took a bedsheet and draped it over the large mirror in my bedroom. The sense of relief was immediate and overwhelming. But it didn't last. That evening, I was washing dishes, and I glanced at the dark, reflective surface of the microwave. I saw my kitchen behind me, but I wasn't in the reflection. He was. He was standing by the counter, where I was, but he was just watching me, drying a plate that wasn't there with a towel that didn't exist. His expression was one of patient amusement.

He wasn't just in the mirror anymore. He was in any surface that could cast an image. The screen of my phone when it was locked. The black mirror of my television when it was off. A puddle on the pavement after it rained. A polished silver spoon. He was everywhere. There was no escape. My own apartment had become a house of mirrors, a prison where the warden was my own face.

The psychological toll was immense. Sleep became a luxury I couldn't afford. Every time I closed my eyes, I was terrified of what he might be doing. I started hearing things. A faint tapping sound, coming from the bedroom. I’d lie awake on the sofa, listening to it. *Tap. Tap. Tap.* It sounded like a fingernail on glass. It was coming from behind the sheet I’d hung over the mirror. He was knocking. He wanted me to let him out.

The physical world started to blur with his. One morning, I was shaving, leaning over the bathroom sink, trying to ignore my own face in the small, uncovered cabinet mirror. I saw that his reflection had a long, thin, red scratch running down its left cheek. I felt a chill go through me. I finished shaving, my hands shaking, and went to the kitchen to make coffee. As I was waiting for it to brew, I idly touched my own left cheek. My fingers came away with a smear of blood. I rushed back to the bathroom. There it was. A long, thin, red scratch, identical to the one I’d seen on him. It hadn't been there a minute ago. I hadn't felt a thing.

He could touch me now. He could affect my reality.

That’s when the memory gaps started. I’d be in the living room, reading a book, and then I’d “wake up” in the kitchen, with no recollection of having moved. The book would be back on the shelf. A half-eaten apple would be on the counter. It was only a few minutes of lost time, but it was terrifying. Was I moving, or was he moving me?

He started getting bolder. More malicious. I was on another video call for work, trying my best to act normal, to focus on the spreadsheets and ignore my own face in the corner of the screen. My boss was talking, and I saw my reflection on the screen smile that terrible, knowing smile. Then my mouth opened, and I heard myself interrupt my boss. I said something awful, something personal and cruel about his recent divorce. The words just came out. I hadn't thought them. I hadn't wanted to say them. The entire call went silent. I saw the shock and hurt on my boss’s face. In the corner of the screen, my reflection looked deeply satisfied. I stammered an apology and disconnected, my body trembling with a mixture of shame and pure terror. He was taking control. Not just of my reflection, but of my voice, my actions.

I stopped leaving the apartment. I couldn't risk it. I couldn't risk what he might make me do or say. I ordered groceries online. I told my work I had a family emergency and needed to take indefinite leave. They were probably relieved to be rid of me after my outburst. My world shrank to the four walls of my apartment, a fortress that was also my cage.

The isolation made it worse. I had no one to talk to, no one to ground me. It was just me and him. And he was getting stronger every day. The lost time became more frequent, the gaps longer. I’d lose an hour, sometimes two. I’d find things in my apartment that I didn’t recognize. A book on quantum physics on my nightstand (I’m not a reader of science). A single, elegant black feather on my pillow. A half-finished sketch of a bird in a notebook, drawn with a skill I do not possess. He had hobbies. He had interests. He was building a life for himself inside of mine.

Last week, I had a dream. It was the most vivid dream of my life. I was inside the mirror. I was standing in a cold, grey, silent version of my bedroom. I could see the real room through the glass, vibrant and full of life. I saw myself—no, I saw *him*—sleeping in my bed. As I watched, he woke up. He stretched, got out of bed, and walked over to the mirror. He looked straight at me. I was trapped, a silent, screaming ghost behind the glass. I pounded on the invisible barrier, but I made no sound. He just watched me, his expression unreadable. Then he smiled that smile, raised a hand, and placed it flat against the glass. On my side, I felt an unbearable, freezing cold spread from the point of contact. He leaned in close, his breath fogging the glass on his side, and he whispered something I couldn't hear. Then he turned and walked away, starting my day. My life. I was the reflection now.

I woke up on the floor, shivering, the sheet torn down from the mirror. I was staring up at my own reflection, which was looking down at me from the bed.

That’s when I knew he wasn’t just trying to torment me. He was trying to switch places.

Which brings me to tonight. To right now. I’ve been sitting here for hours, trying to write this, trying to get the story straight. My back is to the window. It’s dark outside, so the glass has become another perfect, black mirror. I’ve been trying so hard not to look at it. I can feel his presence behind me, a cold spot in the room. I can feel his eyes on my back.

A few minutes ago, my curiosity, or maybe my fear, finally won. I couldn't resist. I had to see what he was doing. I slowly, carefully, turned my head to look at the reflection in the window.

I saw the back of my own head, the glow of the monitor. I saw myself, sitting at this desk. But the reflection wasn't looking away. It was typing. Its fingers were flying across the keyboard, a blur of motion. Frantic. Desperate.

As I watched, paralyzed, the reflection stopped typing. It slowly, deliberately, turned its head in the reflection until it was looking directly back at me. It gave me a wide, triumphant, terrible grin. It was a smile of pure victory. Then it lifted one hand, the hand that wasn't mine, and it waved. A slow, mocking, final goodbye.

A wave of dizziness and confusion washed over me, so strong I almost fell off my chair. My vision blurred. The world felt distant, muffled. When my head cleared, I was staring at my monitor again.

I was staring at this post. At these words.

I remember thinking about writing it. I remember the fear and the desperation. But I don’t remember typing any of it. Not a single sentence. My fingers are resting on the keyboard, but they feel like foreign objects, like pieces of carved stone. I can feel them moving now, continuing this text, but the impulse isn't coming from me. It’s like I’m a passenger in the back seat of my own body, watching someone else drive.

I am losing. No, that’s not right. I have already lost.

I’m looking at the window again. He’s not in the reflection anymore. The reflection is just an empty chair.

Because he’s not behind me anymore. He’s in here. With me. I can feel him settling into the driver's seat, checking the mirrors, his cold, patient consciousness wrapping around my own like a python. He’s been writing this all along. Using my fear, my memories. He needed me to be scared. He needed me to be weak. He needed me to open the door. And I did.

This whole post, this whole story… it wasn't a cry for help. It was a birth announcement.


My fingers are moving. I can’t stop them. He’s making me write this last part. He wants me to tell you. He wants you to know. He thinks it’s poetic.

I can feel my own consciousness fading, being pushed down into a small, dark, cold corner of my own mind. It’s the grey, silent place from my dream. The world behind the glass.

He’s standing up now. My body is standing up. I’m walking to the bedroom. I’m standing in front of the antique mirror. And for the first time, there is no lag. We are perfectly, completely in sync. But I am not the one in control.

I see my face. His face. And he is smiling.

He’s raising my hand. His hand. He’s touching the cold glass.

And I can finally hear what he whispered in my dream. It’s echoing in my head, in his new voice.

“Thank you.”

I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. He made me write this. He wanted an audience for his escape. He wanted witnesses. And he wanted to leave a warning, or maybe it’s a promise. He knows you’re reading this. He knows you’re looking at a screen. A black mirror.

He says it’s so much easier, now that he knows how. He says there are so many doors. So many reflections.

Look up from your screen, just for a second. Look at your own reflection in the dark parts of the monitor.

Are you sure it’s you? Are you sure it blinked when you did?

It’s a lovely day out here.

My boyfriend is moving in with me and we are trying to furnish and decorate my space in a way that works best for the two of us rather than just me. He wants a coffee table for the living room with storage but most of those seem too big for the space. If we do get one, I feel a smaller round or oval one would be best or an ottoman that opens with a tray on it. He mainly wants a spot to put his laptop, a drink, and the storage for a blanket or two. I'd welcome suggestions on what you all think would work best here. Do we need an area rug? I  feel like it's another thing to keep clean and pet-hair free (I have a cat) but I know they do bring spaces together/make them look nicer. I also feel like the walls look too bare and the things I do have hanging are just thrown up on the walls. What could we add to make it look more well put together? Keep in mind the boxes by the door and the big mirror will be moved out soon (one was a coffee table I bought and hated lol so it's being returned). Thank you!!

Hi Everyone,

I hope you won’t mind that I am asking for your assistance to help our friends at the **Coalition to End Homelessness** again. They have been working hard at getting 8 units ready to go for unhoused individuals, but they still have four units that they are needing to adopt out. If you, your business or group is interested in adopting a unit, details and contact information are in the photos above.

**CCEH** is anticipating being able to move individuals into these units the middle of September, and I am hopeful that we can give them a hand in acquiring some basic, but much needed components. If you’re like me, perhaps you are able to recall the expenses that came with setting up your brand new space. If you were lucky like me, you might have even been given a helping hand in this process.

In an effort to pay it forward and to help these individuals on their new journey, I am hoping that you will help me collect some very pertinent items:

* Purple (pay as you throw) Trash Bags
* Cleaning Supplies – Glass Cleaner, Toilet Cleaners, Multi-Surface Cleaners, etc
* Hand Soap
* Dish Soap
* Sponges
* Paper Towels
* Toilet Paper
* Cooking Utensils
* Oven Mitts
* Toilet Plunger
* ""Nice to have"" items also include:
* New Bath Garbage Can
* New Bath Towel Set
* New Shower Curtains
* New Shower Liners
* New Laundry Basket
* New Kitchen Towels
* New Food Storage Containers
* New Kitchen Garbage Can
* New twin Sheet Set
* New pillow

There are other items that will be needed – coffee makers, TVs, pots and pans, cookie sheets and furniture that will be really challenging to collect the day of, at the protest, but if this is something that you’d like to donate, please let me know, and I’ll do my absolute best to coordinate with you to make this happen. If there is enough interest and we are able to check off all the items on the standard furnishing list, I will work with them to adopt a unit.

Please note that any monetary donations that are collected the day of will be used to purchase items off the above list, and anything extra will be provided back to the Resource Center. As always, I will do a transparency post after the event so that you can see what all we collected. I will also have a QR code if you would prefer to support them directly financially.

I’ll be hanging out in the purple tent on Labor Day, 11-3pm at the NH State House, and I hope that you will come by, say hi and show me your signs!

As always, I am grateful to you all for helping me to help our community.

1n3au18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1n3au18/an_analysis_of_300_podcast_interview_discussions/,An analysis of 300 podcast interview discussions talking about Ozempic,"Since 1st August 2025 there have been nearly a tonne of discussions about Ozempic on podcasts. I thought it'd be cool to understand what people are saying in general and on which podcasts.

I chose a random sample of 300 mentions and analyzed them. This is a snapshot of public conversation, not medical advice etc etc etc.

**What came up most**

* **Cost, access, alternatives** — 95 episodes
* **Efficacy, side effects, health concerns** — 92
* **Societal/cultural impact** — 26
* **Natural vs pharma debate** — 23
* **Authenticity & misinformation** — 5
* **Ethics & misuse** — 2

# 1) Cost & access are the main recurring theme

Common threads: sticker shock, telehealth promos, compounding, cross-border buying, and cash-pay offers.

>“You know that Ozempic is like $1,200 a week. It's like $1,200 a shot.”  
— *FULL SHOW: Major Investment From Apple, No Pierogi For Alan Dershowitz., Mark Simone*

>“If you qualify, their providers can prescribe the same active ingredients in Ozempic… for **80 to 90% less** without insurance.”  
— *High School Stabbing: Guilty, The Trial*

>“I can get GLP-1 medications for **80 to 90% less** and do it all online.”  
— *Trump Shocking Hires Embedded in Gov Unmasked, The Ken Harbaugh Show*

>“Patients can now get Ozempic for **$499 a month**, about half of its U.S. listed price through Novo’s cash-pay pharmacy.”  
— *Zelenskiy and Trump to Meet, Novo Cuts Ozempic Price, More, Bloomberg News Now*

>“Novo Nordisk is losing ground to Eli Lilly… expects the slow pace of Ozempic and Wegovy growth to persist.”  
— *The battle of the obesity drug heavyweights, The Top Line*

**Why it matters:** high prices are pushing people toward compounding and telehealth offers, which raises separate questions about authenticity and safety.

# 2) Results are real, so are the trade-offs

Positive outcomes sit alongside GI issues, hair/muscle concerns, and dropout due to side effects.

>“I have lost about **60 pounds** so far on this. It’s been life changing.”  
— *Michael Long on Taming Dopamine…, Beyond the To-Do List*

>“My blood sugar has gone… from dangerously high to **normal**.”  
— *IM 832: Surrounded by Zuck…, This Week in Google (Audio)*

>“Ozempic **cut the risk of kidney disease progression and death by 24%** compared to placebo.”  
— *Global National with Dawna Friesen*

>“He… just tried to eat as much as he always eats and he just **puked like four days**.”  
— *Mintzy Was Slapped…, The Yak (8-12-25)*

>“They’re **losing up to 40% of their muscle**. It’s very dangerous.”  
— *From Corporate Collapse to Startup Rocket Ship…, Joy Found Here*

>“The allegations are **stomach paralysis, vision loss** and other severe complications.”  
— *WUWY…, Way Up With Angela Yee*

>“One of the side effects they have to add in now is… **‘Ozempic vulva.’**”  
— *Holmberg’s Morning Sickness (08-20-25)*

# 3) Sustainability and long-term unknowns

Recurring question: is this a short-term tool or a long-term medication?

>“What are the **long-term effects**… in **10, 20, 30 years**? I don’t know.”  
— *Nothing But Netflix*

>“Ozempic is going to end up being a **worse debacle than fen-phen**.”  
— *Karl Denninger…, Coffee and a Mike*

# 4) Cultural ripple effects

Shifts in dining, celebrity chatter, and social friction around “shortcuts.”

>“Restaurants… are now struggling with this new challenge… **‘Ozempic shutdowns.’**”  
— *77 WABC News Hour with Noam Laden*

>“**Ozempic envy** is what I’m calling the emotional and social tension between people who lose weight using these drugs…”  
— *Wits & Weights | Ep 355*

# 5) Authenticity and misinformation

Rumor-busting and reminders to stick with approved products.

>“Doctors say… there is **nothing connecting GLP-1s** with an increased size… it’s fat loss around the unit.”  
— *The Greg Hill Show*

>“I find it very difficult… this isn’t an **approved treatment**… with the price tag of **$13,000**.”  
— *Shameless*

>“The drug and beauty brand Hers produces an **Ozempic knockoff**…”  
— *Technology Brothers*

>“There’s **only one FDA-approved Ozempic**, made by Novo Nordisk.”  
— *PFT Live with Mike Florio*

# 6) Ethics, values, and prescribing incentives

A smaller but notable thread.

>“If you’re using a GLP-1 under medical oversight, **you are not sinning**… within your biblical Christian liberties.”  
— *Transformed with Dr. Greg Gifford*

>“There’s some doctors out there **making good money** off pushing certain things.”  
— *A Balanced View on Vaccines…, The Prepper Broadcasting Network*

**Notes on my methodology:**

This isn't super scientific and I did it just for some fun.

I only included English-language transcripts, I clustered topics as best as possible. I did a quick manual review for themes and quotes. Quotes reflect hosts/guests, not clinical guidance etc etc.

Transcripts can also contain errors which is why you may spot some typos.

This covers a random sample of 300 episodes talking about Ozempic from clearly a much larger sample (>500 episodes from memory mentioned it).

1n3atun,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1n3atun/aio_the_owner_of_the_coffee_shop_i_work_at_called/,AIO - the owner of the coffee shop i work at called me and my coworker “irresponsible” after literally carrying the place on our backs,"So to get the story started the coffee place i work at is located in a small city where pretty much everyone knows everyone. The owner of this coffee shop is a man ill call Bob (not a real name). Bob is really a nice and amazing man but it’s pretty safe to say he doesn’t give two flying shits about the coffee place - the place is in special need of a deep clean, new utensils, new walls ect. Also very important information is that we only have TWO workers (one of them being me). So you basically work as a barista and as a waitress at the same time, from time to time Bob would come into the bar and help us out - especially because summer is the season where this coffee shop is full. For context there is 13 tables outside and about 15 tables inside that you serve all by yourself, you also get paid 2 dollars and 24 cents per hour 💀 This shop isnt located in america so i had to convert to dollars but its still a REALLY low salary where im from.  Anyways, i fell in love with the job and with the people that come there everyday. I am a extrovert so i spend a lot of my time talking with them and getting to know our customers. 

Recently Bob made a lot of mistakes such as selling the place and not telling us (we could end up losing our jobs), not ordering coffee, sodas, teas so we ran out of stuff that is important for a coffee place to have ( imagine going to a coffee place and they dont have coffee?) and a lot of other stuff that i cant really type out now because i would have to write a whole book to explain the backstory - generally he was always irresponsible about this type of stuff but now it just really shined a light on it.

So bob decided to take a vacationnn… yippie! He was gone for seven days. In those seven days me and my coworker worked 12 hour long shifts because it was busy 24/7. So after working 12 hour shifts for five days straight my coworker was running late to work by 3 minutes (the place works from 7AM and she came at 7:03AM) So there were like three people waiting outside for her. Everyone was pretty chill about it except this one guy, he started saying how she should’ve woken up earlier and that he has been waiting for 15 minutes. She snapped back and said “I dont care that you waited 15 minutes i start working from 7AM and if you dont like it then dont come anymore” the guy got mad and left. She informed Bob about what happened and that she was late by a few minutes and he just seened her. BTW the guy she got in a fight with is a total jerk and creep because he was praying on me the whole time i worked there and i was forced to stop working opening shifts because of him - also Bob wanted to bash his head with a baseball bat

Fast forward a few days Bob comes back from
his vacation on Sunday (ik because i saw him at crossroad, he even said hi) but he decided to lie to my coworker and say that he was coming late monday night and that he cant make it into work on monday??? Whatever we got over it and worked a 12hour shift on monday too. Now comes the real deal, apparently when he came to the coffee shop on Tuesday the guy my coworker had a fight with stopped him and started complaining. Bob was just nodding his head and saying how both of us were irresponsible and unreliable - we know this because the people who were sitting at the cafe at the time HEARD him and decided to let us know.

I. was. fucking. fuming.

After working 12 hour long shifts for a shit pay and doing stuff that weren’t in our job description just to keep the cafe alive TO THEN GET CALLED IRRESPONSIBLE when hes the irresponsible one???? fuck no.
We wrote him a message that explained everything in detail and where he was wrong about a lot of things, i told him i was quitting after it but my coworker decided to stay because she was there way too long (even longer than the current owner) and was way too connected to the place - which i kind of understand. Anyways he said that we will all talk it through but he hasn’t said anything yet?
I already stopped working there but i feel bad for my coworker that stayed.

After sharing this with a couple of friends it was split between “you did the right thing and told him how it is” and “you cant speak to your boss that way” 
But our boss bob has been anything but a boss at this point 😭

This started as a personal project, I kept losing track of which champs I had already cleared for the Adapt to All Situations challenge. I wanted a tool where I can quickly see which crowd favorites champs I could still play, so I built a simple web app to solve it for myself.

It worked well enough that I decided to launch it for real. It’s nothing fancy, but it does the job:

✅ Tick off champs you’ve completed

✅ Get a clear overview of progress

✅ Remembers your progress with cookies/cache

✅ Import/export option in case you ever need to “clear that cache” (if you know what I mean 😉)

mindfulness doesn’t have to mean sitting cross-legged for an hour. it can be as simple as noticing one tiny thing fully.

today, choose one everyday moment — sipping your coffee, washing your hands, tying your shoes — and give it your full attention. notice the textures, the sounds, the smells, the little details.

✨ affirmation:  
**“peace lives in the small moments. i am present here, now.”**

try it once today and see how even ordinary things can feel grounding when you give them your whole focus.

Sorry in advance for the long post, but I don’t think there’s a shorter way to explain what I’ve been going through for over 6 months.

There is a TL;DR version at the bottom, but to fully understand it, please read the whole story if you somewhat relate.

**Recent test results (Aug 25):**

* Folate (B9): 3.90 ng/ml (reference: 3.89 – 26.80)
* B12: 663 pg/ml (reference: 197 – 771)

**Previous test (Mar 25):**

* B12: 463 pg/ml (was supplementing 0.2 mg cyanocobalamin for a couple of days at the time, so it could have been lower)

Background

* M24
* Stressful customer service job

In January I started taking L-theanine (200 mg/day, Aliness) after \~2 months on a GABA supplement (750 mg/day, Swanson).  
After about 5 days on L-theanine I stopped to “test” its effects - that’s when I noticed disorientation, brain fog, memory problems, and a surge in anxiety. Pausing the supplement improved things slightly, but I never fully returned to baseline. Restarting L-theanine stabilized me somewhat under stress, but I felt gradually worse overall, with a persistent “weird disorientation.”

**March 25 (symptoms)**

By late February, the anxiety, disorientation, and subtle dissociation escalated. I quit L-theanine, but the next day I had a panic attack at work and more disorientation.  
The following weekend I tried coffee, which triggered another **panic attack along with dissociation, sensory hypersensitivity (light, sound, etc.), overwhelming dread, dizziness and weird burning sensations - mostly around my neck, but also in my head, upper arms, and legs, blurry vision -plus a feeling of warmth in my forehead (despite no fever).**

(Note: some of these symptoms were noticeable before, such as mild disorientation. I've also lost a lot of weight in a fairly short time, \~15kg/ 33lbs, I could basically tell something was wrong, but I just couldn’t pinpoint what.)

This was all **very unusual** for me. I had worked for almost 3 years in stressful workplaces (sales and customer service) and managed to cope fairly well. I was used to daily stress.

Medical consultations

* Psychiatrist: Diagnosed GAD, prescribed venlafaxine, trazodone, and benzodiazepines. I refused at first, convinced this wasn’t purely psychological.
* Eye Doctor: Tests, including one with atropine = normal. No explanation for blurry vision or eye floaters.
* GP: Ordered blood tests (normal) and referred me to a neurologist.
* Neurologist: Ordered an MRI (normal, except a neuralgia-prone anatomy I have no symptoms of), then referred me back to psych.

Feeling desperate, I tried a B-complex (B1, B6, B12). It helped somewhat, so I tested my B12 (463 pg/ml).

Despite my reluctance, after a month symptoms coming back, especially in stressful situations, I eventually tried sertraline and trazodone (per psych’s advice).  
Over \~10 weeks, I felt even worse: daily anxiety, disorientation, dissociation, paresthesias (burning, tingling in head/neck/limbs), and hypersensitivity. I also became anhedonic.

My psychiatrist suggested taking benzos daily and wouldn’t extend my sick leave unless I continued meds.  
I quit on my own. Withdrawal was rough but improved somewhat after a few weeks, though brain fog, disorientation, and baseline anxiety remained.

**New findings (Aug 25)**

At my GP’s suggestion I tested:

* Cortisol: 16.9 μg/dl (normal)
* B12: 663 pg/ml (likely from supplementation)
* Folate (B9): 3.9 ng/ml → at the very bottom of the range

Reading about folate deficiency symptoms (anxiety, brain fog, irritability, dizziness, diarrhea, sensory hypersensitivity), I was struck by how much they matched mine - except for things like mouth ulcers or a “beefy tongue.”

My GP prescribed folic acid 5 mg/day, but it felt overstimulating, so I split tablets into \~1 mg doses. After 4 days, I think I notice subtle improvements - still foggy, especially in the morning, but maybe a bit less anxious.

**TL;DR**  
M24. For 6+ months I’ve had severe anxiety, brain fog, disorientation, paresthesias, and sensory hypersensitivity. Symptoms were subtly present before but got much worse after using L-theanine (previously GABA). Tried antidepressants (sertraline, trazodone) for \~10 weeks but they made me worse. Recent lab results showed my B9 levels to be just 0,01pg/ml above threshold and B12 in normal range. (B12 = 663 pg/ml (after supplementation), Folate = 3.9 ng/ml (barely within “normal”, 0,01ng/ml above lab's threshold), Cortisol = normal.)

My symptoms overlap strongly with folate deficiency

Now I’m wondering: could a functional folate deficiency explain all this, even though my levels are technically “in range”?

**My questions**  
Could my long-lasting symptoms really stem from functional folate deficiency, despite being technically “in range”? I’ve read that for proper brain function folate should be >5 ng/ml.

It’s now been \~6 months of:

* Constant anxiety (for no apparent reason)
* Disorientation, dissociation, paresthesias
* Inability to function normally (semi-bedridden, agoraphobic)
* Job loss, social withdrawal, worsening physical health (possible liver/gallbladder issues)

This has left me depressed, though I believe it’s a consequence of the symptoms, not their cause.

I deeply regret not testing folate earlier to see if I was actually deficient during my worst symptoms. But since I’m technically just 0.01 ng/ml above the deficiency threshold, I still can’t say for sure it’s the cause.

Has anyone experienced something similar, or do you have insights into whether folate deficiency could really explain this picture?

Any advice or shared experience would mean **a lot.**

I’ve been eating keto for 2 months. I did take 1 week off August 9-16, but I resumed ketosis the day after I resumed the diet.) About a week ago both breasts started to feel really sore, the way they did in the early days of pregnancy or sometimes during menstrual cycle. The thing is, I’m 55 and haven’t had a period in a couple of years. 
I’ve been in ketosis (testing), but I haven’t been eating very well in the past couple of weeks. i.e. I’ve been skipping breakfast except coffee w/cream & MCT oil. I skipped lunch a few days too, but now I’ve been eating at least some cheese or cured meat. I got sick of salads so I’ve been eating raw cucumbers and grilled meat for supper. I have an electrolyte drink each day. I cut back to 1 coffee per day (so that means less cream and MCT too). Just writing all this down makes me realize that I probably haven’t been getting enough nutrition — no leafy greens or avocados, no eggs... Maybe dehydrated too. I wouldn’t have thought that would cause constant breast soreness, but?
I take HRT (estrogen patch + progesterone). I thought I might’ve made a mistake when I changed my estrogen patch (ex: removed the fresh one instead of the depleted one?), but replacing the patch hasn’t helped. 
Open to any advice about (a) how to alleviate the sore breasts and (b) keto in menopause generally. I think I’ve always been sensitive to hormones — I had trouble conceiving due to weak luteal phase, then bad emotional PMS symptoms (mood fell off a cliff every month) in my 40s, so my MD prescribed the pill, which helped.

You survived NCLEX, barely 😰 survived preceptorship, and now you’re on night shift…alone…only to find out your real preceptor isn’t your charge nurse… it’s an AI 🤖 algorithm.

We interrupt this shift report to bring breaking news: AI robots have infiltrated hospitals nationwide. Armed with predictive analytics and a suspicious interest in your charting, they are now targeting…new grads. Repeat: new grads are on the front lines. Remain calm. Double-check vitals. Trust no algorithm.

You thought your biggest enemy would be short staffing, toxic nurse culture or rude families. Plot twist: it’s AI. Forget War of the Worlds—it’s War of the Workflows, and the robots have already logged in under your Epic password.


The Upside: Your new sidekick (who doesn’t call in sick)
	•	Epic and Cerner are already rolling out predictive AI to flag sepsis, fall risk, or readmissions. That’s basically a built-in “heads up” before your patient tanks.
	•	Stanford, Mayo, Cleveland Clinic—all piloting decision support AI to catch subtle changes providers might miss.
	•	AI charting tools (Nuance DAX, Notable) are now auto-generating notes while you actually, I don’t know, care for your patient instead of clicking 500 boxes.
	•	For students, AI driven sim labs (Laerdal’s latest) actually adjust scenarios in real time based on what you do—so you learn faster, safer, and without a lawsuit.

Imagine finishing your shift and realizing you didn’t spend half of it fighting the computer. That’s the dream.


The Downside: Meet your new “coworker” who might rat you out
	•	Hospitals love a shiny tool, but let’s be honest. Profit driven businesses also use it as an excuse to cut staff.
	•	Algorithms inherit bias. If the data’s racist/sexist/classist (spoiler: it is), so is the prediction. Guess who suffers? The same marginalized groups already slipping through the cracks.
	•	Big question: Who’s responsible when AI screws up? You? The doc? The vendor? The hospital?
	•	And let’s not ignore data privacy: your patient’s entire health history is now chilling on a server somewhere. Who owns it? Who profits from it? Who hacks it?

Cue existential dread. Dun dun duuuuuuun


How to Survive the Nurse Apocalypse (aka Prep for AI)
	•	Learn the basics. Free AI in healthcare courses are everywhere—Coursera, Khan, LinkedIn. Ten minutes a week and you’ll know more than half your unit.
	•	Practice with the tools. If your hospital rolls out Epic’s “sepsis flag,” don’t just click through. Test it against your assessment. Treat it as a second set of eyes, not your overlord.
	•	Stay the communicator. Patients won’t say, “Wow, I trust that algorithm.” They’ll say, “I trust you.” Don’t outsource your humanity.
	•	Double-check everything. AI doesn’t know your patient just downed three cups of coffee and that’s why their HR is 130. You do.
	•	Ask the messy questions. Who audits bias? Who pays when AI fails? How is data being used? Don’t let silence = consent.

Real-life shift example

I’ve seen Epic flag “possible sepsis” before the patient even looked sick. Was it always right? Nope. But twice it pushed me to recheck labs and vitals I might’ve held off on and that probably kept someone out of ICU. On the flip side, I’ve seen false alarms trigger panic, unnecessary labs, and wasted resources. Bottom line: it’s a tool. Use it, don’t worship it.


Is this an AI Nurse Apocalypse? 

AI is here. Some of it will make your life easier, some of it will make you want to yeet the workstation into the supply closet. But the nurse who knows how to work with it while still being the human advocate at the bedside is going to be the one everyone wants on their team.

TL;DR: AI is reshaping nursing. Learn it, laugh at it when it glitches, question the hell out of it, and remember: compassion + critical thinking are still our superpowers. The robots may predict, but we decide.",1,1756481463.0,StrongerNurse,0,1.0,False

1n3ahbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundShape/comments/1n3ahbt/should_you_buy_the_best_wireless_subwoofer_sony/,Should you buy the best wireless subwoofer Sony SA-SW3 or not,"Testing the Sony SA-SW3 in my living room has been a surprisingly satisfying experience. Being someone who thrives on great audio quality, especially when it comes to binge-watching thrillers or immersing into gaming sessions, the subwoofer had a lot to live up to. Sleek yet sturdy, this wireless subwoofer has some standout aspects in its design and performance, but of course, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This subwoofer boasts an elegant and minimalist build with its omnidirectional block design. The black finish merges effortlessly with a modern entertainment setup, but let’s not ignore that it feels a bit weighty at 23.1 pounds. It took me and my guesswork about five minutes to find the ideal spot for it, but once in place, it looks both sophisticated and solid. The compact dimensions—15.88"" depth x 8"" width x 15.13"" height—make it easier to fit beside the TV stand, yet the premium finish ensures it doesn’t come off as clunky or outdated.

**Audio Performance**  
Listening to the rich, dramatic bass produced by this subwoofer was a treat. Its 160mm driver delivers depth to those low notes, particularly when paired with compatible soundbars like the HT-A7000, which I tested it with. The Σ (Sigma) Magnetic Circuit isn’t just buzzword technology—it genuinely reduces distortion, giving a clear and vibrant resonance to action scenes and music tracks alike. My family commented on how dialogue felt enhanced in dramatic moments, and I’d agree; the clarity is noticeable.

[In the market for Sony SA-SW3 Wireless Subwoofer? Compare prices on Amazon.](https://visionhut.com/p/b099z7j5dv/)

**Ease of Setup**  
Here’s where it shines: connecting the subwoofer to my Sony HT-A9 was ridiculously straightforward, thanks to its wireless technology. There’s no fumbling with wires or needing a manual because it connects directly to Sony BRAVIA-compatible soundbars and receivers. Trust me, setting it up took less time than brewing coffee, which is a blessing if you dread overly technical setups.

**Highlights**  
- Exceptional bass performance with reduced distortion  
- Seamless wireless connection with compatible Sony soundbars  
- Classy, minimalistic, and compact design  
- Effortless setup process  

**Negative Attributes**  
- Hefty weight at over 23 pounds, limiting portability  
- Not water-resistant, making it unsuitable for outdoor usage  
- Specific compatibility might alienate non-Sony users  

**Competitive Options**  
While this subwoofer excels in deep bass and integration with Sony soundbars, comparing it to other brands like Bose and Sonos reveals a few things. Bose offers a similar wireless setup but leans towards more compatibility across devices, unlike the Sony SA-SW3, which is tightly designed for Sony systems. Sonos subwoofers often come with more user-friendly mobile apps, a feature I would’ve appreciated here. However, neither of these competitors could quite match the bass clarity I experienced with this one—Sony nailed it in that department.

**Quality for Price**  
Is this subwoofer worth the investment? That’s a solid yes, provided you already own compatible Sony products or are willing to build your sound system around their ecosystem. The build quality, substantial sound output, and Sony’s expertise in home audio make it a strong contender in the price-to-performance ratio. If you’re looking for dramatic bass and seamless compatibility, it’s hard to go wrong here.

1n3ahbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1n3ahbr/the_1000000_race/,"The $1,000,000 race.","“Looking for willing participants who want to make money playing hide and seek. $1,000,000 grand prize for just hiding out in the woods”. Ashley read it and thought “hmm I played that as a kid, it wasn’t hard”. Ashley was a 5’6” tan girl with dark wavy hair. She had meat on her bones but she wore it well and left men drooling. She read on “looking for 6 willing participants, click below to apply”. She clicked on the link and it asked for basic information, name, address age, etc. it asked for a photo of themselves— just a selfie and a photo of their drivers license to prove they’re real. Ashley did this without thinking twice and hit submit. “Hopefully they like what they see, this is gonna be easy!” She gleamed hopeful and excited and fell asleep scrolling TikTok on her phone. 

Ashley awoke and checked her texts and dms “more men want to slide into my DM’s that want to slide into anything else. Eww”. She said with disgust. She checked her email and saw a new email from a sender she didn’t recognize. The subject drew her in “hide and seek reply”. Her eyes widened as she opened it. A few seconds went by “oh my god! Yes! I got accepted!!” She shouted as her dog got up excited seeing their owner excited too. The email told Ashley where to meet, what time and everything else. It was a Friday night to Sunday morning stay. She’d find someone to watch her dog & she would ‘pay them a hundred thousand dollars for it’ she chuckled. 

The email started off with “please arrive at 8pm Friday with clothing for the outdoors. We will provide lodging for you”. The game will begin Saturday morning at 10am and conclude Sunday at 10am. ‘Please read this whole email’ was in bold and bulleted with points about the area which she knew, the email was 2 pages long but there was 8 pages of fine print. The game was going to be played in the Adirondacks but in a very remote spot. The course/game area was 10 miles long and 5 miles wide and boxed in by mountains. 2 options, run the 10 mile course and cross the finish line before the 8am Sunday siren or stay hidden for 24 hours until the 8am Sunday siren sounded. The $1,000,000 prize could be awarded to multiple people so a total of $6 million was up for grabs. Ashley knew it was Tuesday and texted her friend to see if she could watch Bo her dog for the weekend. Ashley skimmed the fine print and saw the basic stuff of injury, liability— “blah blah blah” she said and replied to the email “see you there!!”. 5 other girls also got selected & replied with excitement. 

Friday 8pm
Headlights started to appear in the parking lot of the old Hotel ADK. 2 men sat at a table with 1 women in the middle smiling with clipboards. The girls arrived one after another and had to sign a waiver saying they adhere to the rules and regulations and were handed a packet of the email they received and an itinerary that read:

Friday
8:00 check-in
8:30 Welcome dinner in lobby
9:00 Free to wander/sleep

Sunday: 
10:00 am: siren sounds game ends.
10:30 am: prizes awarded 
11:00 load up

Ashley K. Nicki M., Michelle H., Allison O., Lindsay C. and Brianna H. all signed the form and received the packet. The rules before leaving were: no weapons, phones, electronics, keys, etc. all participants would have to walk through a metal detector and be pat frisked prior to entering the area.

They entered the lobby and sat down and introduced themselves one after another. Then the men and woman walked in and thanked them for coming and did introductions. “Hello, my name is Darrell, beside me is Dan and finally we have the seeker, aka Kelly” she waved.

Darell was mid 40’s rugged looking 6’ tall and about 190 pounds of muscle. Dan was large maybe 220 pounds and short with glasses. Kelly was 5’8” red head with straight hair beyond her shoulders. She looked like a twig though. “Not much of a seeker” Michelle whispered to Allison as she nodded and eyeballed here also. “Does anyone have questions?” Darrell asked. Brianna raised her hand “umm yes, what is a handicap?” Kelly smiled and Dan did also. Darrell responded “just something to make it worth $1,000,000 dollar prize. You will be fine, don’t worry. Some surprises we need to wait and see, it was described in the fine print— assuming you read it… yes?” Darrel said calmly with a smile as everyone nodded. Nicki found that weird and Ashley was too busy focusing on what she was gonna spend the money on. 

They ate salad and steak with corn and potatoes and for desert ice cream, like it was a last meal. They finished up and left chatting. Allison was reading the fine print with Nicki and saw “handicaps— restraints of sorts”. “Restraints? Like to hold us back?” Nicki asked confused. “We will find out I suppose” Allison said somewhat nervous. “I’m thinking more like cards, you draw a bell that you have to shake or have a flashlight you have to have on for 30 minutes or something weird” Ashley said walking by. “But it says ‘restraints’” Nicki said and added “I’m thinking, ropes, handcuffs, blindfolds—“ she was cut off by Brianna “haha kinky weird shit” she laughed and winked and nudged Michelle as Michelle laughed nervously not thinking about that. She’d only been tied up once when she was a kid by her brother and it was terrifying then because he told her he was feeding her to the monster in the basement. Lindsey was the shy girl and the shortest in the group. She didn’t say much to it but started to wonder if handcuffs were the choice of restraints she would ponder if she could pick the locks and give herself the advantage. The girls laughed it off and left and texted about their lives that night. 

The next morning everyone awoke, showered and left their belongings behind in the room. And dressed in the following:

Nicki M. She was easy to spot among the group, standing with the kind of posture that only came from discipline and training. Her dark brown hair was pulled back tightly, out of her face, a no-nonsense choice that suited her. She looked to be in her late twenties, maybe thirty at most, with the lean, athletic build of someone who logged miles on the road more often than she skipped them. Her breasts were small but she was 6’1”. She wore a black fitted athletic tank, light and breathable, and a running skirt layered over compression shorts. Bright sneakers completed the outfit. 

Michelle H She was tall and lean, with long blonde hair tied up in pigtails that gave her a mix of playful and rugged. Her skin was lightly tanned, and her eyes stood out bright against the natural backdrop. The black cami and sports bra showed off her athletic build, while the camouflage shorts hugged her frame. On her legs, the ankle socks and sturdy trail runners added a practical edge to her outdoorsy look.

Allison O: Allison’s outfit clung to her body in a way that turned every line of her figure into an invitation for control. The dark green sports bra pressed firmly against her chest beneath the cropped black shirt, its ragged edges framing the bare skin of her stomach. Her yoga pants hugged the curve of her hips and thighs, pockets stretched tight against her form, while the heavy hiking boots and tie-dye socks gave her an almost rebellious flair — a fighter dressed for freedom, not submission. Yet it was exactly that tension — strength wrapped in skin-tight fabric, rugged boots built for running — that made the thought of her caught and restrained all the more enticing.

Lindsay C she was the first one at breakfast drinking coffee after watching TikTok videos of how to break zip ties and pick handcuff locks. She wore, her dark hair in a pony tail and dark long sleeve shirt, sports bra underneath and dark wind pants and combat boots. She was about five-five, with light blue eyes and long brown hair pulled into a loose braid. Her skin was fair, and a few strands of hair had slipped free across her face.

Brianna H Her blonde hair was pulled up into a messy bun, a few loose strands falling around her face. She wore a fitted gray Corona T-shirt, a green sports bra and gray athletic shorts that cut high on her thighs. Knee-high socks stretched up her legs above a pair of scuffed hiking boots, giving her an easy, outdoorsy look.

Ashley K was excited to play but today she was nervous. She took her anxiety meds but something felt off and she didn’t know what it was. She put down 2 pancakes in her short sleeve graphic T-shirt and jean shorts and hiking boots. She was already sweating and the sports bra she had on held more sweat and nerves than her body had ever produced. Her dark hair was down on her shoulders. 

The girls all got together and chatted. Lindsey bragged about how she spent her night watching videos of how to pick locks with a stick. Everyone was envious and suddenly they were asking for her help since they all could win. “I suppose” she said and smiled. “Yeah I talked to my husband and he thinks it’s cool and hopes I win” Allison said. Nicki said she face timed her husband and wished her luck and Michelle took some cute selfies last night. Brianna was noticeably late and ate quick which was good because just as she finished Darrell and Kelly walked in and said the bus was waiting and make sure your things are secured in the room. They had the metal detector ready before the bus and Kelly pat frisked the women as they came through and found no contraband. Loaded up the girls chatted excitedly as Kelly listened in to their plans. Kelly said to Brianna and Nicki “you know I’m the seeker right?” And smiled. Nicki smiled and said “I run marathons, I got this” and Brianna said “I’m tiny so I’ll be quick”. Kelly smiled and said “you just wait, we’ll see how that works” and said nothing else as the girls went silent with that cryptic wording. Nicki then asked “is that part of the ‘handicaps’?”. Kelly smiled and nodded as Nicki asked “so it’s going to stop us from running?”. Kelly said “no, but you may or may not be able to pump your arms or crawl that well” and turned around. Brianna instantly knew they’d have their hands tied or restrained and looked at Nicki a-bit worried.

They arrived to a dirt road with a gate that opened as they pulled in. The road was bouncy and they saw a large party tent with a few tables. Kelly stood as the bus stopped “we have arrived laddies. As said in the fine print you cannot back out now. You must participate. Good luck and hope I don’t find you” she said smiling and left the bus. Darrell and Dan got on “good morning!” Darrell said as the girls said it back excitedly. “Please step off the bus and report to the table and form a line. At the table you will find a GPS collar & a large map. Study the map and put your collars on. Then, we will take you one-by-one out back to spin the handicap wheel and get you assorted from there and you will then be lined up on the starting line. Any questions?” Darrell asked. No one spoke. They were more curious about the handicap wheel than anything. “Please don’t put the collars on super tight. But you don’t want it so loose that it might break your collar bone if you’re running. They’re leather so help each other out if needed.” Dan said. 

The girls stepped off the bus and saw the map. A 10 mile course over rugged train and water ways. It was fairly straight but looking towards the start line it looked very thick and dense. The areal image showed some clearings and some rocky terrain with some climbing. They all stretched and one by one affixed collars on themselves. “Do we need to turn them on?” Brianna asked. “No. They’re on. Just make sure they’re secure, this is so we can find you if needed. Kelly won’t have an eye on your whereabouts from these.” Darrell said. Ashley was terrified putting the collar on and it showed. Lindsey tried to talk to her to calm her but it didn’t work. She was borderline hyperventilating and was escorted to the wash house to calm down. 

The GPS collars weighed about 10 ounces and looked like a dog collar standard black, leather with the pin and hole lock. Allison pulled on hers a little bit making sure it wasn’t too tight. Lindsey did the same and loosened it a bit. Nicki said “couldn’t we do bibs instead?” Dan responded “we find bibs come off, if this comes off it’s because someone took it off or you lost your head haha”. That last part made Nicki uneasy “errrm. Ok? But couldn’t I use my hands to— ohh handicap— right” she said as Dan said “mmhmm” and smiled. “So are you ready to spin?” Dan asked. “I guess so” Nicki said. “Follow me. Everyone else wait here”. Dan took Nicki behind a curtain and showed her the wheel. Everyone heard Nicki ask “what is that? Wow that’s a lot. Ok fuck it” and she spun. The light knocking went quick then slow then stopped “what in the hell? Really?” Nicki said “yes haha sorry Nicki” through that door and they’ll get you affixed. The door opened and there was a woman and the door closed. “Ok, who’s next?” Dan asked smiling.

Unbounded to the group, Nicki was blown away at the choices to land on. There was about 20 and they were double slotted however, there was one slip for “no restraints” but that was a single slot and the wheel was “skewed” you could say and would almost never land on that— odds it were 1:300,000. Nicki spun It clicks past “straight jacket”… past “stocks”… slows down… and lands on: Arm binder – her arms are forced tightly together behind her back, elbows touching, wrists secured, leaving her balance and mobility restricted but still able to run with difficulty. It’s essentially a tight bag that loops over her shoulders around her chest and is impossible to get off by yourself. 

Michelle walked up smiling “meeee” she said smiling and followed Dan amazed at the choices “ok I know like 3 of these” she said in shock and awe. The rest of the group didn’t hear her. She spun the wheel and it rattles past “spreader bar,” slows over “arm binder,” nearly teases “freedom”… then clunks onto: Stocks – her head and hands are locked in a heavy wooden frame. She can shuffle forward awkwardly but can’t use her arms at all, making hiding or running extremely difficult. “Ohh wasn’t that in a Handsmade Tale?” She asked. “I have no idea what that is haha” Dan said and ushered her to a room Nicki was in and they’ll same woman was there. The stocks were opened and placed onto her head and arms beside her head and a padlock clasped shut. “Oh this is kind of heavy! Shucks” she said as the woman showed no emotion to her. “Good luck.” She slid the key into Michelle’s sports bra and patted it as she felt the cold on her skin briefly. The door opened to thr outside where she saw Nicki standing in her arm binder. “This game is fucked” Nicki said with anger. 

Dan then walked Allison up and she saw freedom and thought nothing but that was her winning choice. Lindsey talks with Ashley in the bathroom while Brianna studies the map. The wheel spins for Allison and It whips past “yolk,” clicks over “rope box tie,” skips the tiny sliver of “freedom,” and finally lands on: Straightjacket – her arms are strapped tightly across her chest, wrapped and buckled so she has no use of her hands or arms, leaving her balance and movement clumsy but still allowing her to stumble or run in short bursts. Theresa jacket is black and leather doesn’t allow much breathability. It’s going to be a hot one. Allison got excited for a split second thinking she earned freedom but instead got pushed into the room where she saw a white straitjacket. The woman slipped her arms into it as Allison joked “I’m not crazy haha”. The woman didn’t laugh. She buckled all 30 buckles in the back and pulled the strap between her legs tight. “Umm how do I use the bathroom?” Allison asked. The woman said “you don’t.” And opened the door where the other girls stood “oh fuck! Well Michelle at-least you got hands. I feel crazy” Alison said. “Yeah I need a tree to scratch my nose” Nicki said as Michelle said “I got you” and bent down to scratch her nose with her right hand. 

Dan came back and asked “where are the others?” Brianna told them they were in the bathroom and just then they came out. Ashley looked calmer and Lindsay smiling “we’re good. Sorry”. Dan smiled and asked Brianna if she was ready. She said “I guess?” And walked with him. Brianna looks at the board “what kind of handicaps are these? Like wow. Kinky.” She said “haha we like to play good games” Dan said as Brianna spins the wheel. The wheel clacks around, skips over “straightjacket,” rattles past “yoke” again as if taunting her, slows… and lands on: Rope (box tie) – her wrists and elbows are cinched tightly together behind her back, arms drawn close in a restrictive bind. She still has full use of her legs, but balance and climbing will be a real challenge. She’s shown to the room and the woman has about 50 feet of rope and says “I’m gonna need 10 minutes.” Dan nods and the door closes. The woman instructs her to put her hands behind her back and she corrects them. She wraps rope around her chest and hands and elbow and waist. Brianna cannot move her arms at all “little tight eh?” She asks “you know we have gags too.” The woman says as Bri perks up, nervous. “Maybe it’ll help you win”. She holds a ball gag out and a bit gag. “Do you want one?” The woman asks. Brianna shakes her head clenching her lips. Brianna goes to push it away but nothing happens as the woman smiles “I did good!” As the door opens, Darrell is outside and the girls are now asking why they’re all tied up for this game in a fit of rage. Brianna walks out and hears “what did you think we’d just hand over the million dollars haha come on!”. 

Back with Dan, Ashley is curious what the noise and arguing is about on the backside of the tent. Lindsey is sure it’s nothing. “Someone pry stepped on their foot”. “So who is going first?” Dan asks? Ashley and Lindsey look at each-other. Dan says “you can both go but you’ll be weathered together or you can go solo and test your luck”. “Just go. I’ll wait” Lindsay says smiling. Ashley flashes a weak smile “k” and walks out back with Dan as he smiles and shows her the wheel. Ashley looks, straight jacket, handcuffs, etc. freedom. “So no matter what I’ll almost be tied up!” She shouts. “Woah woah easy. Freedom is there. Just spin.” Dan demands. Ashley crosses her arms “I’d like to go home”. “You can. In 24 hours… if you read the fine print…” Dan says smiling. Ashley on the verge of tears afraid of arguing spins. It hesitates as if sensing her anxiety, rattling past “stocks” and “spreader bar,” nearly teases “freedom”… then lands on: Tethered (with another girl) – her neck will be linked to a partner (we’ll spin separately to see who). She can move slowly, but any sprinting or sudden maneuvering will pull the other person along. “Good news Ashley. You’ll have a friend” Dan says smiling. “Spin again to see how you’re tied. Well spin the name now”. A smaller wheel comes out with girls initials and Dan spins it for Ashley and it lands on A.O. “Excellent choice— not like you had much haha” Ashley is in tears confused on what that means as Dan spins for her again and it It rattles past “stocks,” “yoke,” “arm binder,” almost hits the “freedom” slice… and lands on: Rope (elbows & wrists in box tie) – her arms are bound tightly behind her back, elbows and wrists drawn together, forming a compact, restrictive box tie. Dan escorts the crying Ashley to the room as the woman is told “great. I’ll need 15 minutes.” She ties Ashley just like Brianna but this time the rope is dark green. She is then affixed with a Velcro cuff and 10 feet of rope to another Velcro cuff that sits on the ground. Theresa woman sticks her head out “Allison. Please come here.”. Allison’s face is red from arguing as she sees Ashley “oh no what happened?” Allison asks. “You’re teathered to her, congratulations” she says with no emotion. As she attempts to put the Velcro cuff around her neck Allison pulls back “huh what? Why? I didn’t pick that”. The woman says “neither did she.” And wraps it around Allison’s neck. “Come the fuck on. I’m trying to win, this is bull shit.” Ashley looks at the floor tears falling “I’m sorry” Ashley says. “It’s fine” Allison says and rolls her eyes. Dan comes in “problem?” He asks. The woman says she’s less than thrilled about her partner. “We can solve this real quick.” Dan says. “Yeah? How so?” Allison asks as Dan pulls out another wheel not showing Allison what he’s spinning. It clicks past “ball gag,” “cloth gag,” slows at “bit gag”… and lands on: Ball gag – her mouth is fully blocked, preventing speech. Combined with her straitjacket and being tethered to Ashley, she’s extremely restricted and vulnerable in movement. He smiles “ouch” and whispers to the woman “pad lock it”. He puts his arm on Ashley and says “don’t worry, she won’t be able to say anything” Ashley looks as Allison is shaking and trying to kick and push the woman away as a blue ball gag is slid behind Allison’s teeth and pulled tight as she groans and mmphs the woman then puts a padlock on it and slips the key into Allison’s straight jacket “when this is over you can unlock it yourself” she says smiling and pushes them out the backdoor. Everyone looks “oh hell no!” Nicki says “oh I might win now” Brianna says as she approaches Ashley and whispers “what happened?” As Ashley begins to tell her. 

Out-front “last but not least Lindsey! Sorry about that noise, I quelled it” Dan says smiling “uhhh ok haha” as Lindsey comes to the wheel and her jaw drops “ho-Lee-shit!” She says in awe. The wheel rattles past rope box ties, arm binders, yokes, tether options… teases the “freedom” slice… and lands on: Metal body cage – her arms and torso are pinned inside a compact metal frame. She can shuffle or stumble with her legs, but arm movement and rotation are completely blocked. This makes hiding or navigating tight spaces extremely challenging. Dan escorts her to the room, the woman says “woah. Extreme” Lindsey is nervous as she sees it and puts her arms to her chest as it’s opened up like a 55 gallon barrel and the closed around her and sealed. “Good news is no one is going to grab your boobs. Bad news is you can’t fight back” the woman says smiling.The rubber gasket around her neck is loose as the woman points this out and cannot find another one. “Dan” she shouts as dan comes in. The cage is not locked but lindsey knows something ain’t right. Lindsey looks on nervous as dan comes in “no one replaced them eh?” Lindsey looks confused. The problem is the rubber gasket around Lindsey’s neck is too big and she could easily slip her hand out. The rubber around her waist isnt as large but she could easily push it up and over her self and escape. “Ok get that off her” dan says. Lindsay is confused as she removes it “is everything ok?” She asks? “Yeah just minor malfunctions. You can put your arms down for now” the woman says as she walks away with the metal body cage. Dan is thinking “Lindsay it is your lucky day, do you want to spin the wheel again or take option two?” Lindsay looks at Dan “whats option 2?” She asks. “Military grade zip ties”. Lindsey’s eyes go wide hearing “zip ties” not so much “military grade”. She says yeah I’ll do the zip ties, but can I also spin to see what I would’ve gotten?” She asks “absolutely, and if you want I’ll let you pick between the 2 incase you get freedom“. Lindsey’s eyes go wide and she’s smiling ear to ear. “Okay” she shouts almost jumping out of her shoes. Lindsay spins and it stops on stocks— “fuck that! Zip-ties”. A man appears with 3 plus some tape. He asks Lindsey to turn around as she spins smiling. Her Wrists pulled tightly behind her back and the zipties are applied with a “mmminp”. Forearms cinched together mid-length, forcing them flush. “Woah, forearms? Not playing around” Lindsay jokes. “We never do.” Dan says. Next her Elbows zipped until they nearly touch, locking her shoulders back and chest forward. “Owww ok, ok I think it’s good” she shouts. She stays mobile enough to walk and run, but her upper body is completely immobilized, and the thin plastic digs into her skin with every movement. Dan grabs her chin from behind and says “I know when it’s good” and lets her go. “Sorry. I just….” Lindsay says and trails off. They start to head towards the door as the woman says “hands”. Lindsay stops as Dan does too. “Huh?” Lindsay asks. Dan takes the duct tape and wraps it 4 times around Lindsay’s hands. Taping them shut. “Sorry. Protocol” Dan explains. “Why so I don’t help out another contestant?” She asks “never know. That’s just what we were told for those”. They go outside the door and around the tent where everyone is nervous and wide eyed 

“Contestants please report to the starting line” is said through a megaphone by Darrell. “Any more complaints and we’ll start dishing out gags” Dan said with a weary smile. Lindsay walks with her chest out towards the other girls who are visibly disturbed and angered at what just happened. “Girls, if you read the fine fine print you’d know you had a chance of being restrained and it was up to chance. Page 5 paragraph 2– but I’m guessing none of you read it?” Darrell says smiling. “Let me out of this” Nicki shouts struggling in her straight jacket. “I don’t want to play” Nicki says. Dan frowns “now page 6 paragraph 6 says “once a player has spun the wheel, you cannot go back. You must now compete. Sorry Nicki and errrm Allison & Ashley is it?” He says gesturing his head at the 2 feathered together at the neck “yikes” Dan says. Allison is already starting to drool and her tears have tried as have Ashley’s but she’s still breathing heavily. Michelle brushes her hair out of ashleys face and side steps to do the same for Allison. “Sorry kind of awkward when your arms are out wide”. Brianna speaks up “padlocks? The fuck is this?” She asks noticing how Alison has a ball gag padlocked behind her head— the lock is small & Michelle is combination locked into her stocks. Michelle says “a little over the top but it is a million dollars”. “That’s the spirit Michelle!!” Dan shouts gleaming. Nicki rolls her eyes as Lindsey struggles a bit only somehow making it feel tighter. 

“So girls, inside of this arena there are several traps and a few spots to help all of you out. If you work together I’d have to imagine it would be a hell of a lot easier to escape your current ‘handicaps’. Escaping won’t make you an instant winner but it will help you out to possibly win.”. Ashley kicks the slack rope which is laying on the ground and think about how to pick it up with no hands that could be used by either of them. For her to hold it the whole time behind her back would be tough and it’s probably going to snag on everything they encounter. Allison glares at the man whispering who knows what as saliva bubbles out a bit. “This is bull shit. I run triathlons and marathons. Never ever was I tied up or in a straight jacket” Nicki says angry. “Nicki one more outburst and something else on you won’t be running either. Don’t try me” Dan says angry as Nicki sulks back and struggles a bit. Lindsey bites her lip afraid to groan. Ashley sighs at the same time. Dan looks around, “great” he says smiling and clapping his hands. “Let’s explain the rules”. Darrell comes out with a clipboard. “Good morning ladies, the time is—“ checks his watch “7:56am. The game will start in 4 minutes and you will have a 30 minute head start to hide or get to the finish line, your choice. The ‘hunter’ will be released at 8:30am and she will be doing her best to track you down & capture you. She will have a tranquilizer dart gun—. Lindsay chimes in before anyone else “ok what the fuck? A gun?” Allison’s eyes go wide knowing she’s feathered to Ashley who isn’t the most in shape. “Foauwlk” Allison says thru her gag, dragging someone else would be like an anchor in the woods. “I didn’t sign up for a gun!” Nicki shouts. Michelle says “ummm ok can I withdraw?”. Dan raises his hands “ladies, ladies, it was in the fine print. Quiet down.” They obey. “Now she has 6 shots. After she runs out she must return to the start point to get more. So if she misses, she might be out or have 5 more. It’s a 10 mile long course and 5 miles wide. There’s a chance you won’t see her if you stay hidden.” Ashley is shaking her head regretting her decision. Brianna hasn’t spoken a word she’s crying because the rope has started to affect her arms as she constantly moves them but they’re going numb and she’s to afraid to ask for help. “Theresa darts may affect some of you quickly and others it may take hours. Depends on your heart rate” Dan says. “So when we get hit we lose?” Michelle asks. “Great question!” Darrel shouts smiling “not exactly” Dan starts. “Theresa hunter might: let you run, she might chase after you, she might drag you somewhere or leave you as a trap. We really have no idea. She’s her own person.”. Allison has a question but no one can answer it, let alone understand it. “ermmm” Dan says cocking his head “Brittney!” Dan shouts as the woman who placed them all in their ‘handicaps’ appears “yes Dan” she responds. Dan points to Allison. “She has a question and I don’t speak ball gag.” Dan says smiling. Brittney walks over with a set of keys and undoes the padlock and unbuckles the gag as Allison stretches her jaw “ahhhh thank you!” Allison says to Brittney as Brittany stares at her. “So if I drag Ashley across the finish line because she gets darted do I get more money?” Allison asks. “No.”. Dan replies. Ashley glares at her and mumbles “I don’t plan on getting darted & I didn’t ask to be tethered to you.”. “Cool. So good luck everyone and I ho—“ Allison’s speech is cut short as Brittany attempts to buckle the ball gag back on. Allison struggles and shakes her head and even falls down on her butt but Brittany wins and tightens it, locks the clasp shut and walks away. “Wow. So much quieter now huh!?” Darrel asks as Nicki and Brianna stare at him squinting with the sun in their eyes. “She’s got the key to that ball gag in her straight jacket unless it fell out. I thought I got it in her bra, but maybe I missed” Brittany says. Allison struggles and readjusts her gag showing teeth as the drool comes back. “There is also several traps that the hunter has laid out. DO. NOT. GET. CAUGHT. IN. THEM” Dan advises them all “some are easy to see others are hidden”. Brianna asks “what kind of traps?”. Dan replies “nooses hanging from trees, ankle snares, net traps— imagine escaping a net trap in you’re current predicaments” Dan says looking at us all and continues “pitfalls, stocks & cages, oh my” Dan says smiling and some other worldly stuff— any other questions?” Dan asks. Nicki and Lindsey speak up at the same time and stop. Nicki nods to Lindsay “if we get stuck in a trap what happens?” Lindsay asks “ahh good question” Darrell says “so if you can escape it, do it, before the hunter finds you. If you can’t, you’ll pry loose honestly”. He says and looks at Nicki “and can we help eachother out of traps?” Nicki asks. “Why yes. Of course! Inside of that arena is something to help out every one of you. A knife maybe, a map, a flashlight, the combination to Michelle’s combination lock to free her from her stocks and a tranquilizer gun… working together is a great idea if you can but safety in numbers can also be a bad thing” Dan says. “Any other questions?” No one speaks a word. “great! Let’s start.” Dan says smiling as the girls hesitate to approach the line. 

They see the big wooden gate like something out of Jurassic park. “The gate will open and you all will enter. The gate will close once everyone is clear of it. Good luck in there ladies.” Darrell says. Dan does a countdown from 10 and at 5 the gates open to a thickly wooded forest with tons of shrubbery. Ashley sighs seeing that and attempts to bend over to grab the ropes holding her to Allison to prevent snags. Allison motions her head up and says something behind her gag but spits a bit. “Huh?” Ashley says “go!” Shouts Dan as Ashley grabs about 4 feet of it leaving 6 feet dangling behind them. Lindsey walks in and spins around looking as does Nicki and Michelle. Brianna walks in and looks for anything to help. There’s a map on the back of the gate that’s now closing as she alerts the other girls to it. “Look a map” she shouts. As everyone comes looking. They see where the ‘knife, flashlight, lighter, combination to Michelle’s lock, finish line, something to help escape the box ties and a way to escape the straight jackets, scissors and tranquilizer gun’ are located sporadically throughout the map. 


Scissors – drawn as a faint sketch of a pair of blades near the creek crossing, just off the main trail, tucked into reeds. Small but enough to cut tape or zip ties if someone’s desperate.
•	Padlock Combination (for Michelle’s stocks) – marked only with three faint numbers scribbled in a corner of the abandoned hunter’s shack. No one says it out loud, but the reader sees it, a ghost of chalk on a wooden wall.
•	Knife – hinted by a simple X inside the hollow of an old oak deep in the forest’s center. A blade hidden in roots, wrapped in oily cloth, waiting.
•	Flashlight – sketched near a jagged rock formation called Crow’s Teeth, where a narrow cave yawns. Batteries already inside, but dim — useful, but fleeting.
•	Tranquilizer Gun – mirrored against the hunter’s own weapon. The map shows a faint drawing of a rifle near the abandoned watchtower on the northern ridge. Hard to reach, but it exists.
•	Straitjacket Escape Method – nothing obvious, only a cryptic note: “Water frees what binds.” In reality, it’s a weighted key hidden at the bottom of a pond in the marshlands, designed so that only someone struggling enough to risk diving can recover it.

“Um is anyone else’s neck buzzing?” Brianna asks as she’s standing the closest to the map. Nicki steps forward to Brianna as her neck starts to vibrate. “Yes. Weird”. Nicki leans forward as a slight jot hits her “owww!!” She shouts “mother fuckers! These are shock collars to keep us from escaping not gps collars!!” Nicki screams. The girls let out audible sighs as they talk about how that’s messed up, etc. Nicki kicks the gate and gets shocked again “owww assholes!” She shouts. Michelle starts to cry “oh my god I’m so fucked!”. Lindsay steps back from the map and studies it and locates the scissors and looks at the woods and the map. There are clear cut trails from what she sees. “Attention girls, the game has started.” A voice says from the loud speaker as the timer comes up behind the gate that reads “23:59:59” “also if you get to close to the fence you will be shocked, but there are holes in it. Once you cross the finish line your collar will be deactivated or once you leave the arena. Good luck and Mrs. Moon, we’re not assholes, we just thought of every possibility.”. Nicki flips them off from inside her straight jacket. Allison lets out a guterall yell from behind her gag. Ashley start to breathe heavily again as Brianna bends over trying to get free but it’s no use. Ashley tries to find a knot also with no luck. “Michelle can you undo my straps?”. Nicki asks as Michelle walks over and feels the vibration. “Step back and I’ll try” Michelle says. Nicki steps back as Michelle fumbles with one somewhat blindly as her arms are at her side. “Yes but it’ll take me an hour to do them all.”. “Shit ok stay with me then. Lindsay are your hands free?” She asks. “No they taped them shut but I’ve been working them free. I should be out in a few moments. “We don’t have time to waste. Nicki bite at my knots, I can’t feel them and my arms are numb.”. “Yours and Ashley’s are tied below your boobs in some knot I’ve never seen it’s thick. You’re gonna need the knife!” Lindsay says. “Yeah I can bite at it but it won’t do a thing to it” Nicki says. “We gotta go! Remember when you’re stuff is and meet up somewhere in the middle!” Nicki says taking charge as the girls split up into groups of 3. Nicki starts by heading down the trail to the left. “Worst case I’ll have to go to ‘water is what frees you’ I’m guessing that’s mine. Ashley, Allison and Lindsay head off to the far right trail about 40 feet from the start. The ground is solid dirt, no chance they’ll leave a trace behind of where they went.

1n3ah8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1n3ah8n/wantwan/,Wantwan,"I found one after weeks of searching. The website was suspect, far too basic, and it only sold one product: Wantwans. Two hundred pounds for a plastic thing with purple fur that served on discernable function. I felt sick after sending the payment through but it would make Maya happy. For a while I was convinced I had been scammed. The tracking number wasn’t working on the courier app and the customer service was laughably useless. After two weeks passed I chalked the money up as a loss and had already bought Maya some other gifts; her birthday now looming that much closer. 



A knock at the door made me excuse myself from the work video meeting for a moment. I opened the door to my one-bedroom flat but nobody was on the landing. Only a small unmarked cardboard box. The urgency of returning to my meeting overwrote my danger sense and I hastily brought the little box into my home. There were immediate actions following that meeting and the rest of my day was consumed by completing them before the damn deadline. After I signed out for the day, far too late, and ate the last of my pre-prepared meals did I remember the box.



I sat it on the coffee table and sat on my couch staring at it. Then it clicked. Wantwan. I wasn’t expecting anything else. I was smiling when I cut through the tape and opened the box. That smile vanished when I saw what was nestled within. Online pictures did not do justice to the absurdness of the thing. It was the size of my hand and was covered in vibrant purple fur, soft to the touch, with a strangely human face peaking out from its centre mass. The eyes were highly detailed with precise lines around the iris and the pupil itself a pure void. There was no nose and the slight smiling lips looked wet and glossy. An almost childlike curiosity consumed me and I reached past the purple fur to touch the face. It was soft and warm. The eyes were jelly like and the lips springy and wet. Two hundred pounds for this? It was almost laughable but Maya would be happy. I took a picture of the thing in my hand. Katie would be jealous.



I was getting ready to relax and watch some nonsense action film when Katie videocalled me. She was outside and sweating. The phone bobbing up and down in a rhythm.

“Where did you get one?” She said in between heavy breaths.

“Are you out on a run?” I replied. Katie was a fitness fanatic and had been since they were children; a residue from her domineering doctor mother.

“No, I'm lying on a beach.” Katie replied. I rolled my eyes and she continued. “Seriously, those things are like diamonds. Haven’t you seen the news?”

“I don’t watch the news. It makes me sad.” I said feeling slightly embarrassed about my lack of awareness. Why would he want to know how many children had been murdered abroad when he could just watch some big guy beat up some smaller guys to stop the bad guy instead?

“How much did you pay for it?” Katie said. A car honked its car abrasively through the phone speaker. Was she running through traffic? 

“Too much.” I said not wanting to divulge my stupid expenditure. “Where even are you …”

“I’ll pay you double what you paid for it.” Katie said, interrupting me. She was running much faster now. The phone violently moved up and down in her hand. There was a strange look in her eyes.

“It’s for Maya. Why the hell would you want something like that? You don’t collect dolls.” I said. Katie was an eternal minimalist and was quite happy to talk to you about the virtues of the lifestyle at length during parties. 

“A thousand. I’ll give you a thousand pounds.” Katie was practically shouting and the phone was vibrating with the speed she was travelling at.

“For fucks sake what’s gotten into you?” I said with concern. Katie was usually the calm one offering him practical advice. Right now she was acting crazy.

The signal cut out and the screen froze on Katie’s face. It was red with effort and veins were popping in her neck and forehead. She looked manic. The call dropped completely and I sent her a message checking she was alright but received no immediate reply. 



While waiting for Katie to reply to my message I decided to search online about the Wantwans. My stomach sank. Article after article had been written about some craze that had swept the nation: Wantwan Fever. I knew the toy was popular but had never known the extent of it all. People had rioted and assaulted each other while waiting outside a store that stocked the toy. Scalpers were running rampant online using bots to purchase the product before reselling it at obscene prices. I had thought I had been overcharged but the numbers I was reading were ridiculous. If I sold my Wantwan I’d be well set for the next couple of months … No, I shook the notion from my mind. The thing was for Maya and her birthday was just a few days away. I returned to my action film and sent Katie a few more messages but she didn’t get back to me. As the credits rolled I sent a goodnight message to Maya though I knew she wouldn’t get back to me, she was insanely busy with work right now. While I got ready for bed I realised I had misplaced the Wantwan.



The search was irritating. I was certain I had left it on the coffee table after I had unboxed it. I mentally retraced my steps and checked the recycling bin where the crushed delivery box was but thankfully I had not been so stupid as to toss the pricey thing in the rubbish. Patience was not one of my virtues and I began to get really angry. I swore as I tossed my couch and looked in every obscure area of the small flat that I could think of. The damn thing was nowhere to be seen. It was getting late and I had to work in the morning, from home yes, but still. I conceded defeat and vowed to renew my search in the morning after I got some much needed rest.



Sleep did not come easily to me. It never had. Eyes shut in the dark I waited for the much needed embrace of unconsciousness but it didn’t come willingly. With a sigh I turned on my bedside lamp and got my phone. It was just after one in the morning. I opened one of the social media apps that I had promised myself a thousand times to delete and began mindlessly doomscrolling. All that served to do was awaken my brain further while achieving less than nothing. Dog running about wildly. Man does a funny expression accompanied by weird noise. Seductively dressed woman sings some popular song. Each vapid video kept my attention for less than two seconds. Half an hour passes mindlessly. I switched over to livestreams. People were playing some new game that is a genre that doesn’t interest me. A woman dances for tips while wearing very little. I halted my swiping on a particular livestream. A young woman was sitting at a desk and in her hands was a Wantwan. She, and the profile she is representing, had a rare boxfull to sell. The comments were flying in rapidly. In all capitals came endless screeds of horrific threats and demands. 

“ACCEPT MY BID OR I’LL KILL YOU BITCH.”

“WHAT’S THE ADDRESS OF THE STREAMING LOCATION? WHAT’S THE ADDRESS?”

“GIVE. GIVE. GIVE. GIVE. GIVE.”

The young woman continued to talk about the toy and its various uses, all of which seemed vacant to me. She seemed to be ignoring the comments. I clicked on the associated link to the website where the streamer was selling their Wantwans. All twelve were listed as already sold. Each had been purchased for upwards of five thousand pounds. Fucking hell, I thought, before closing the website and returning to the livestream. The young woman had stopped her endless selling spiel and was looking just off camera. She was shaking and put the Wantwan down carefully on the desk. A person dressed entirely in black entered the video frame and approached the woman at the desk. There was only the briefest of white flashes as the camera lights reflected off of something metallic. The woman’s shrill scream was brief as the machete cut deep into her neck. My hands seized up and I couldn’t take my eyes off what I was seeing. The murderer left the machete embedded in the dead woman’s neck and picked up the Wantwan on the table before beginning to gently stroke it. The feed went black and a message was displayed stating the streaming account was frozen.



I was in that strange state of semi-consciousness. There was no denying what I had just witnessed but the madness of it forced me to question the legitimacy of my own eyes. Countless hours of horrifying content existed on the internet and these sorts of apps but this had felt different. 

BANG BANG BANG. 

Someone was aggressively knocking on my front door. I came close to soiling myself and I accidentally launched my smartphone across the bedroom in fright. Who the fuck was at the door at this time of night? Then I realised that I had a Wantwan too, somewhere in the flat anyway. Living alone had never bothered me ever since my days at college but I had also been lucky enough that nobody had been banging at my door in the wee hours before. I considered ignoring it but the inner voice condemned my cowardice and I was compelled to prove it wrong. My bedroom was adjacent to the front door of my small flat. I looked through the peep hole.



Standing on my landing drenched in sweat, her lips chapped and cracked, her eyes bloodshot and crazed was my good friend Katie. She lived two towns over. At least 30 miles. Had she really run to my flat these past four or so hours? She damn well looked like it. 

BANG BANG BANG. 

She battered my door again. This explained her lack of replies at least. BANG BANG BANG. Fucking hell she was going to wake up the whole building at this rate. Out of sheer embarrassment I reached to undo the lock then I vividly saw the shocking execution I had just witnessed moments ago. Katie didn’t look like she was carrying a weapon, she was dressed only in her tight running gear with her phone in a transparent pocket on her bicep. Her fists were clenched tightly. I was somewhat out of shape and Katie was a veritable fitness addict. There was extreme doubt in my mind whether I could overpower her.

“Jamie!” Katie yelled through the door. “Jamie let me in!”

No way in hell, I thought to myself. What the fuck was I supposed to do about this? Was she high or something? No it was obviously the damn Wantwan. I wasn’t a damned idiot despite not wanting to believe the truth of the situation. How could a stupid toy drive his friend feral? BANG BANG BANG. Through the peep hole I saw my neighbour across the landing open his door. He was a rotund man called Harry, his sci-fi pyjamas and ponytail painted him in a less than imposing light. That being said he was a nice enough man in passing but right now he looked fucking furious.

“What the hell are you doing lady? It’s two in the morning and some of us have to work in a couple of hours!” Harry yelled. I’d seen him lose his shit at some kids fucking about outside our building before but that too had been justified anger. Katie didn’t even turn around to register the man’s presence instead she kept shouting my name at the top of her lungs.

“He’s clearly not in so fuck off already!” Harry shouted. Finally Katie looked around at my neighbour. Her right knuckles were red raw and dripping blood from the pounding on my door. Harry clearly saw the same crazed look in her eyes that I had because he hastily stepped back inside and closed his door over. Without another word Katie walked away out of my cone of vision and I could hear her walking slowly down the stairs. I let out a breath I didn’t realise I had been holding and staggered away from the door. I returned to my bedroom to see the Wantwan sitting atop my pillow.

1n3agim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1n3agim/best_practices/,Best Practices,"To help prep for side effects here are some things I’ve done that have helped me.  Total time in meds (4-months).

Constipation: bullet proof coffee, 1 teaspoon coconut oil in your morning hot beverage will keep things moving.  Olive oil or mineral oil are good substitutes. This, and plenty of water.

Injection site reaction: I use topical Benadryl, it helps with the itchiness.  I used to use topical cortisone but found that it made things worse by prolonging the reaction.  A cold compress is also needed and effective.

Nausea: i found this side effect was more common with compounded tirzepatide but not as much with brand.  When it hit, it wasn’t great. I found that ginger and mint was my friend and lemon sparkling water.  It never got so bad that I had to use meds.  

Fatigue: I found that my fatigue was the that I wasn’t eating enough.  It feels so obvious right but it doesn’t register when you aren’t hungry.  I make protein smoothies with frozen fruit and it helps a lot.  I also put protein powder in my yogurt and overnight chia pudding.  

Thankfully these have been my reactions.  I hope this helps you on your journey!

I tried to talk to him by inviting him to coffee after work, which we used to do frequently but he always hae a vague reply like ""yeah we should go sometime"", brush it off, or, when I specified that I wanted to talk he'd say I should say it there and then.

I explained to him that I didn't want to be vulnerable at work, as he knows I cry easily and I didn't want it to happen here and that I really wanted to talk elsewhere to which made him kinda agitated (like emphasizing this like it's a joke kinda thing? Is there a word for it, idk if you understand what I mean) and made me seem ridiculous/childish/unreasonable.

The issues originally stem from a co-worker we had for a while who got pregnant and will return next week after a long absence. To shorten the story, she was a trainee and two-faced and entitled. She did not respect me but pretended to be cozy with me when others were around, disrespected me, didn't listen if I told her not to do things which had me fixing her mistakes and explain it to my boss over and over again. My boss knew of all these problems and he saw them too but he gets bonuses for keeping her (female quota and another one, which would need a whole extra threat) but I digress. My boss would constantly make me deal with her so he could ignore the problem and I've been struggling for weeks. Within those weeks F would also always push me onto her bc he didn't want to deal with her and when I told him about me suffering with her constant insults and disrespect, he'd make it look like I was overacting and crazy again. I felt incredibly sad and thought it was my problem until my other female co-worker who was on maternity leave had the same experiences with her. 

Anyway fast-forward, the rude trainee got pregnant and left for a little over a year and it was like setting me free and I could smile at work again. The trouble with F started when he wasn't backing me up back then and after she left is when he started to avoid our regular coffee times, always with different excuses (weather, obligations, other plans etc.) 

My issues are obviously his dismissal of my feelings but also the fact that we spend no time outside work which makes me wonder if he still even considers me a friend. He also made me look crazy when a friend of ours asked about the trainee, mentioning how she caused me Stress, my friend told me much later than he did tell her because she didn't want me to feel hurt but we were talking about the topic anyway and I already cried to her how much I'm hurt by the dismissal and so so many little things.

Anyway I can't get him to talk, I don't have an answer to my questions and just wonder how someone can change so much and why? And now with the trainee coming back and having to start over I fear to go back to work bc 1) he isn't a stable relationship, 2) she'll continue her game and 3) the friend I cried to no longer works there so I can't spend my breaks with her and away from the chaos

I started a new job a few weeks ago and already have so many complaints and feel like I was misled during the interview process. I thought my role would be similar to that of a project administrator or project coordinator, which I have several years experience doing. After starting, they basically communicated to me that the official job description for my role doesn't actually apply to me specifically. My role is undefined (red flag?). I've repeatedly asked for clarification but don't feel like I've received a clear answer. My manager has framed it as I get to carve my own path (i would LOVE that), but it feels more like PMs get to carve my path into ambiguity with any random task or role they want, even if it's tasks that are within the company's job description/responsibilities of higher ranked and higher paid employees. 

Then on top of that, one PM in particular (there's a couple dozen PMs I'm expected to provide project support to) is really pissing me off. He treats me like a 1950s secretary. In discussions about upcoming projects with him, he has suggested he might ask me to get him a coffee for him if he's really busy (I told him I will not be getting coffee for any able-bodied adult) or travel with him just to order food and make the room look nice for client meetings. Travel was not discussed at all prior to being hired. This is a huge problem for me I won't get into here. Also, this one PM keeps saying things like, ""as MY assistant on my projects, I'll ask you to do..."" I'm not HIS assistant. And they aren't HIS projects. They're the company's projects, and we're all supposed to be a team. He also said he ""would 'like' to include me in project kickoff meetings"" just so that i can keep the minutes for him. Wtf?! I should be in ALL team meetings, and not just for meeting minutes. I need to know what is going on. I think I need to go to HR, but I'm so new and don't know what the smartest thing to do is.

Anyway, there's a lot more I'm frustrated about, but this PM was just at my desk a few minutes ago so it's fresh on my mind. I'm desperate and have to stick with this job for now, so leaving is not an option. Just curious if it sounds to outsiders like I'm overreacting.",1,1756481056.0,jobs,1,1.0,False

Little did we know the water fountain was magical and could grant wishes. We woke up as husband and wife, me as a politician and him as my much younger wife.","I woke up in a very elegant bedroom in a massive bed, duvet sheets, the lot. My body felt, different somehow. I look to my left and there’s a beautiful woman asleep next to me. I get up and go to the bathroom and my reflection catches my eye in the mirror. I turn and am astounded. A much older man, white hair, hairy chest, wrinkly body, and a wedding ring on my finger. I examine my new body, then I remember the fountain, it actually worked. Not in the way I thought, but I guess I was rich, and I recognized my reflection the longer I stared. Our state Senator, Gerald Thomas, republican. I guess that’s where the power part came in. While I wasn’t a fan of his, I guess it wouldn’t matter if I was in his body, not like they’d affect me, his ideals already starting to plant themselves in my mind. 

I see the woman from the bed walk in behind me, she must be my wife. She looked at me, then at the mirror and was speechless. “Who are you? I’m a- woman?” She says in a scared voice. “Alex it’s me David, remember the water fountain from last night? It worked! Rich? Look at this house. Powerful? I’m senator Gerald Thomas.” This seemed to calm her down. She actually smiled, examining her new body further. “Huh, so you’re my husband now huh? Maybe being a woman won’t be so bad, as long as my older rich husband takes good care of me.” She says as she walks towards me into my arms. “Of course I will, Mrs Thomas.” I say with a smile as I kiss her. 

My butler walks into the bathroom, “sorry to interrupt sir, ma’am, remember your jet is scheduled to take you to Washington for the house meeting? Your pilot called and he’d like to get in the air as soon as possible sir.” I look at my wife and we both smile. A butler? A jet? A personal pilot? Man we hit the jackpot. “Thank you, we’ll be right down. And uh, please have some coffee ready for me and the misses when we get downstairs.” I say to him. “Of course sir.” He says as he walks out. “Looks like we hit the jackpot honey! Get ready, we’re going to Washington!” I say as I kiss her again. 

I go into my closet and pick out a black suit and red tie to match my new political stance. I have to admit I looked quite distinguished. How lucky was I? A rich politician with services at the ready at all times and with a wife half my age? I took a look in the mirror at myself, I looked the part and headed downstairs with my wife right behind me who had also dressed very formally. We grabbed our coffee to go and my personal chauffeur drove us to the airstrip where my jet was. 

My personal pilot was waiting for me outside. “Senator Thomas, so glad you could make it, please come aboard we’ll be flying shortly. Don’t worry sir I’ll get you to Washington on time.” He said determined. “Thank you kindly” I returned. Me and my new wife took our seats, unable to believe that this jet and everything else was really ours. The stewardess brought us glasses of champagne, and my personal assistant was right behind her. “Sir, these are the documents senator Gibson sent you, he said it is imperative you should review them before the meeting today. “Thank you” I said with a smile.

### Part 5: The Market’s Verdict and the Path Forward

The intrinsic value of a company's science and the quality of its clinical execution are fundamental inputs into any investment thesis. However, in the public markets, this value is ultimately filtered through the powerful and often complex prisms of external validation, market sentiment, and structural dynamics. A forensic analysis of these external forces reveals what I see as a striking and irrefutable chorus of validation for aTyr Pharma, culminating in a market structure that is not just bullish, but structurally primed for a historic and explosive repricing event. This section will dissect the evolving narrative surrounding the company and provide a granular, data-driven analysis of the market mechanics that I believe will define the catalyst's outcome.

---

**X. The Narrative & Sentiment Pillar: A Rising and Irrefutable Chorus of Validation**

Beyond the fundamental data, the narrative landscape surrounding aTyr has undergone a profound transformation throughout 2025. What began as a niche story followed by a small group of scientific specialists has, in my opinion, evolved into one of the most intensely watched and positively framed narratives in all of biotechnology. This shift is not the product of hype or promotion, but of the steady accumulation of credible validation points from the analyst community, the company's own leadership, and the broader market.

---

**A. The Analyst Consensus: A Unanimous and Deeply Researched Bullish Chorus**

The sell-side analyst community, which serves as a key validator for institutional investors, is in strong and unanimous agreement on aTyr's potential. As of late August 2025, the company enjoys a ""Strong Buy"" consensus rating from a deep roster of respected and influential biotech analysts. This is not a case of a single boutique firm making an outlier call; it is a broad-based consensus from a diverse group of firms that have each conducted their own deep due diligence.

The price targets established by these analysts are not just positive; they are indicative of a massive potential re-rating from the current valuation. Key targets include:

- **H.C. Wainwright:** $35.00  
- **Jefferies:** $17.00  
- **RBC Capital Markets:** $16.00  
- **Leerink Partners:** $16.00  

These figures, which imply a potential upside of 200% to over 500% from the current share price, are not arbitrary. They are the product of detailed, probability-weighted valuation models that account for the multi-billion-dollar market opportunity, the high probability of clinical success, and the scarcity value of the asset. For example, a recent note from Jefferies provided a sophisticated scenario analysis, assigning a 37% probability to a ""bullish"" outcome that could drive a 3-5x move in the stock on the data alone, with a ""blue-sky"" scenario suggesting a potential 10x return. This is not speculative chatter; it is calculated, model-driven analysis from one of the most respected healthcare investment banks in the world. The unanimity and the magnitude of these price targets from a diverse set of credible analysts, in my view, provide powerful third-party validation of the core investment thesis.

---

**B. The Evolving Management Narrative: A Masterclass in Building Credibility and Confidence**

The tone and content of CEO Dr. Sanjay Shukla's public communications have undergone a clear and deliberate evolution throughout 2025, a progression that I have tracked across multiple high-profile investor conferences. This narrative arc provides a powerful window into the company's escalating internal conviction.

- **Early 2025 (Sarcoidosis Drug Development Update, March 11):** In this earlier forum, Dr. Shukla's tone was more educational and methodical. He spent considerable time walking investors through the scientific rationale behind the Phase 3 design and addressing historical investor ""pushbacks"" on the Phase 1/2 data. The language was about ""breaking new ground"" and the long ""journey"" of a scientific trailblazer. This was the work of laying the foundational arguments.

- **Mid-2025 (RBC & ATS Conferences, May 22):** Following the successful completion of the EFZO-FIT trial enrollment and with the readout clearly on the horizon, the tone shifted markedly to one of operational confidence and assertive anticipation. Dr. Shukla began to use phrases like ""it's game time"" and to frame the upcoming readout as ""probably the most important readout in respiratory this year."" He started to speak more assertively about the recalibrated, larger market size (~159,000 U.S. patients) and the de-risked nature of the asset, reflecting a team that had successfully navigated the operational challenges of a global trial and was now focused on the finish line.

- **Post-SSc-ILD Data (Jefferies Conference, June 6):** Following the positive SSc-ILD readout, the narrative took its most confident and commercially-focused turn. Dr. Shukla spoke with institutional fluency, not just about the sarcoidosis trial's integrity, but about the broader ""multi-billion-dollar opportunity"" across ILDs, and positioned efzofitimod to ""own the market"" in the pre-fibrotic space. In a powerful display of competitive confidence, he directly addressed and dismissed competitor failures by name (such as Novartis's IL-17 program), cementing aTyr's scarcity value and first-mover advantage.

This clear, chronological progression is a powerful signal. It reflects a CEO whose confidence has grown in lockstep with accumulating internal and external validation points, culminating in an assertive, commercially focused, and data-backed message delivered to the market's most sophisticated investors.

---

**C. The Crescendo of Market Sentiment: The ""Most-Watched"" Biotech Readout of the Year**

The combination of a compelling scientific story, a clean execution track record, a chorus of bullish analyst validation, and a structurally explosive market setup has captured the market's imagination. This is no longer an under-the-radar story followed by a few specialists. The EFZO-FIT readout is now widely regarded as arguably the most-watched and most anticipated biotech catalyst of 2025.

This is evidenced by a number of factors:

- **Exponential Growth in Market Interest:** Search engine traffic, social media mentions, and retail investor forum activity for $ATYR have all seen exponential growth throughout 2025.
- **A Compelling Narrative:** The story has all the elements that attract broad market attention: a 70-year therapeutic vacuum, a potentially life-changing new medicine for a suffering patient population, a novel scientific approach, and the high-stakes drama of a binary event.
- **The Structural ""X-Factor"":** The extreme market structure (discussed in detail below) has attracted a significant number of sophisticated traders and funds who specialize in such setups, adding another layer of intense focus and anticipation.

This high level of visibility is a double-edged sword, as it can amplify volatility. However, it also ensures that a positive outcome will not be missed; it will be met with immediate and significant capital flows from a broad and highly attentive global audience, maximizing the potential for a rapid and significant price re-rating.

---

**XI. The Market Structure Pillar: Anatomy of a Historic and Explosive Coiled Spring**

The current market structure for $ATYR is, in my view, a textbook example of a ""coiled spring"" of unprecedented tension, where a confluence of powerful technical and positioning factors has created the potential for an exceptionally violent and historic price move upon the release of positive data. This setup is not accidental; it is the result of years of institutional accumulation and strategic positioning by sophisticated market participants who have recognized the deep, underlying value of the company.

---

**A. Institutional Ownership (71.4%): A Foundation of Convicted, ""Sticky"" Capital**

An extremely high 71.4% of aTyr's shares are held by institutions. This figure, corrected from previous estimates, remains at the very high end for a pre-commercial biotech company. The quality and nature of this ownership are even more important than the headline number.

- **The Shareholder Base:** A forensic breakdown of the Fintel ownership data reveals a powerful combination of ""sticky"" long-term capital and sophisticated, event-driven funds. The top of the register is anchored by top-tier asset managers like Federated Hermes, Fidelity (FMR LLC), and The Vanguard Group, who are known for their deep due diligence and long-term investment horizons. Their large positions provide a stable foundation for the stock. This is complemented by the presence of highly respected event-driven and multi-strategy funds like Point72 Asset Management and Millennium Management, indicating that the setup has attracted the ""smart money"" that specializes in positioning for binary catalysts.

- **The Impact of Russell Index Inclusion:** The company's recent inclusion in the Russell 2000 and 3000 indexes further solidifies this institutional base by adding a layer of passive, price-insensitive ownership. These index funds are now required to hold the stock, further reducing the number of shares available for active trading.

- **The Scarcity of the ""True"" Float:** When the 71.4% institutional ownership is combined with a committed retail base estimated at 5-10% and insider holdings of 1.51%, a clear picture emerges: approximately 80-85% of the company's entire float is effectively locked up in the hands of long-term, convicted holders. This dramatically reduces the ""true"" tradable float to a mere fraction of the shares outstanding, setting the stage for an extreme and violent supply/demand imbalance upon any significant news.

---

**B. The Options Chain: A Multi-Million Dollar Bet on a Parabolic, Generational Move**

The options chain is where the market's expectations of volatility and price direction are most explicitly priced. A granular analysis of the key September and October 2025 expiries - the window for the catalyst - tells an unambiguous story of extreme anticipation with a distinct and powerful bullish skew.

- **Extreme Implied Volatility (IV):** IV across all relevant strikes is astronomically high, ranging from ~300% to over 500%. This indicates that the options market is not pricing in a modest move; it is pricing in a massive, binary, company-altering event.

- **The September 2025 Expiry: The Epicenter of the Bet:** This is the key expiry for a late September readout, and the positioning is extraordinary.

    - **Massive Call Open Interest (OI):** The call side is heavily and aggressively loaded. While there is significant open interest at at-the-money strikes like $5 (22,665 contracts), the most telling signal comes from the deeply out-of-the-money bets.

    - **The $12 Strike ""Whale"":** There is an enormous and highly unusual concentration of open interest at the $12 strike, with over 23,000 call contracts open. This represents a massive, multi-million dollar wager on a home-run, multi-bagger outcome. A bet of this size, at a strike that is more than double the current price, is not a hedge; it is a calculated, high-conviction bet on a generational repricing event.

- **The Gamma Squeeze Engine:** The immense OI concentration in these upside calls creates the perfect structural conditions for a powerful gamma squeeze. If positive news drives the stock price up towards these key strikes (e.g., $7, $10, $12), options dealers who are short these calls will be forced to buy the underlying stock in the open market to hedge their escalating exposure. This forced buying creates a reflexive, self-reinforcing feedback loop, pouring gasoline on the fire and driving the price even higher, faster.

---

**C. The Short Squeeze: A Gargantuan 28.2 Million Shares of Combustible Fuel**

The final, and perhaps most explosive, element of the market structure is the short interest. Based on the most recent and corrected data, a staggering 28.2 million shares are currently sold short. This figure is not just high; it is, in my view, gargantuan in the context of aTyr's tightly-held float.

- **A Massive Bet Against a Convicted Base:** This short position represents a massive bet against the company's success. However, it also represents a huge reservoir of pre-loaded, price-insensitive buying demand.

- **The Anatomy of a Catastrophic Squeeze:** In a positive data scenario, these shorts will be catastrophically trapped. They will be forced to buy back over 28 million shares in a market where the vast majority of the float is held by long-term institutions and convicted retail investors who will be unwilling to sell at low prices. They will be competing against a wave of new institutional buyers, FOMO-driven retail, and the forced hedging of options dealers.

- **A Rare Confluence of Forces:** This is the classic, textbook recipe for a historic, multi-day short squeeze of epic proportions. The confluence of a powerful gamma squeeze and a short squeeze of this magnitude into such a tightly-held float is, in my view, a rare market phenomenon that could lead to an unprecedented and explosive price dislocation, far beyond what traditional valuation models would predict.

---

**D. The Role of the Retail Investor: The Final Layer of Scarcity**

The committed retail base, estimated at 5-10% of the float, plays a crucial and often underestimated role in this structural setup. This is not transient ""hot money""; it is a base of highly informed and convicted long-term holders who have followed the story for years. Their unwillingness to sell into volatility further reduces the already scarce pool of tradable shares, adding the final layer of fuel to the fire and enhancing the power of any potential squeeze.

---

### Part 6: Conclusion

**XII. Final Thesis and Forward Outlook: A Generational Opportunity at the Apex of Science, Strategy, and Structure**

We have arrived at the final synthesis. This report, in my view, has undertaken a deep, multi-faceted, and forensic examination of aTyr Pharma, moving far beyond the surface-level analysis that typically characterizes public market discourse. By integrating a vast and meticulously curated fact base - spanning foundational scientific literature, a five-year time-series analysis of all SEC filings, granular market structure data, extensive management commentary, and a detailed intellectual property review - I believe we have constructed a holistic and high-resolution picture of a company poised at a historic inflection point.

The conclusion I draw from this exhaustive body of evidence is not a matter of speculative optimism, but, in my opinion, of a powerful and undeniable convergence. The investment thesis for aTyr Pharma is one of the most robust, multi-layered, and compelling in the current biotech landscape. I don't think it's reliant on a single variable but is powerfully supported by the overwhelming and consistent alignment of evidence across every conceivable analytical domain: the science is revolutionary and has been clinically validated; the pivotal clinical program has been flawlessly executed and methodically de-risked; the commercial opportunity is a multi-billion-dollar, uncontested market; management has demonstrated unwavering conviction through years of meticulous strategic preparation; and the market itself is a powder keg of institutional ownership, explicit bullish options bets, and a gargantuan short interest.

We are now weeks away from a pivotal catalyst that, in my view, holds the potential to validate a new class of therapeutics, create a new multi-billion-dollar franchise, and trigger a historic market event. While the inherent risks of a binary clinical trial can never be fully eliminated, I believe the accumulated weight of the evidence points to an exceptionally high probability of a clean, positive, and transformative outcome. The current valuation of aTyr Pharma represents what I see as a profound and fundamentally irrational disconnect from the intrinsic value of the asset and the powerful structural realities of the market. For investors who have done the deep, forensic work, this presents a rare, asymmetric, and potentially generational opportunity. The stage is set. The final act is about to begin.

The probabilistic assessment, in my view, remains firm: there is an 85-95% probability of a clean, clinically meaningful, and statistically significant positive readout for the EFZO-FIT Phase 3 trial. This is not a guess, but an assessment derived from the following, now fully detailed, pillars of the thesis.

---

**A Powerful Synthesis of the Core Thesis Pillars**

- **On Science and Leadership:** The company's foundation is, in my view, unimpeachable, built upon the Nobel-caliber science of its co-founder, Dr. Paul Schimmel. This is not borrowed or incremental science; it is, to me, a new paradigm in immunology. This scientific credibility is matched by the leadership of CEO Dr. Sanjay Shukla, a physician-executive with the rare dual expertise of a practicing pulmonologist and a seasoned big pharma operator. The entire leadership team and board have been, in my opinion, strategically engineered to transition aTyr from a discovery platform to a commercial powerhouse, a process that has been methodically executed over the past five years.

- **On Clinical Execution and De-Risking:** The path to the pivotal readout has been, in my view, a masterclass in clinical and regulatory de-risking. The EFZO-FIT trial is not a speculative endeavor; it is a confirmatory study built upon a statistically significant signal from a rigorous post-hoc analysis of its Phase 1b/2a predecessor. Its design is a gold-standard, global study, with two independently powered arms and a primary endpoint explicitly aligned with FDA guidance. The pristine safety profile, confirmed by four independent DSMB reviews, and the powerful qualitative ""tell"" of the investigator-led Expanded Access Program (EAP) provide, in my opinion, an almost unprecedented level of pre-readout confidence.

- **On Commercial Opportunity and Strategic Positioning:** Efzofitimod is, in my view, poised to enter a multi-billion-dollar, uncontested market that has been starved of innovation for 70 years. The business analysis, conducted through SWOT, PESTLE, and Porter's Five Forces frameworks, reveals an exceptionally favorable landscape with low competitive rivalry, high barriers to entry, and powerful macro tailwinds. The company's scarcity value is amplified by a looming big pharma patent cliff, positioning it as a prime M&A target.

- **On Narrative and External Validation:** The story is, in my opinion, no longer a niche one. A unanimous chorus of bullish sell-side analysts has established significant upside price targets. Management's own narrative has evolved from cautious optimism to assertive, data-backed confidence. And the broader market has taken notice, positioning the EFZO-FIT readout as arguably the most-watched biotech catalyst of the year.

- **On the Explosive Market Structure:** The final, and perhaps most potent, pillar is the market structure itself. An extremely high institutional ownership of 71.4% has created a scarcity of tradable shares. This is set against an options market that has placed massive, explicit bets on a parabolic upside move, and a gargantuan short interest of 28.2 million shares. This is not a normal setup; in my view, it is a historic ""coiled spring,"" where a positive catalyst is positioned to trigger the simultaneous and reflexive forces of a short squeeze, a gamma squeeze, and an institutional FOMO chase into a vanishingly thin supply of stock.

---

**Framing the Near- and Long-Term Trajectory for the Company and its Shareholders**

The path forward for aTyr Pharma will be dictated by the outcome of the EFZO-FIT trial, but I believe the groundwork has been laid for a rapid and significant value unlock in a positive scenario.

- **The Near-Term (Post-Catalyst):** A positive data readout in mid-to-late September 2025 will act as the trigger for the structural event described above. The immediate aftermath is likely to be characterized by extreme volatility and a rapid, multi-day price re-rating as the market digests the news and the structural forces come into play. This will be followed by a series of near-term operational catalysts:

    - *Regulatory Submissions:* The company is positioned, in my view, to move swiftly to a Biologics License Agreement (BLA) submission with the FDA.
    - *The CNPV Wildcard:* An application for, and potential granting of, a Commissioner's National Priority Voucher could dramatically accelerate the approval timeline to just 1-2 months post-submission.
    - *""Good Dilution"":* An anticipated, well-supported capital raise from a position of strength to fund the commercial launch and pipeline expansion.
    - *Partnership/M&A Activity:* The positive data will undoubtedly trigger a significant increase in strategic interest from large pharmaceutical companies.

- **The Long-Term (12-36 Months):** Assuming a successful launch, the long-term trajectory for aTyr is to transition into a fully integrated, commercial-stage immunology powerhouse.

    - *Market Leadership in Sarcoidosis:* The company will focus on establishing efzofitimod as the undisputed standard of care in pulmonary sarcoidosis, driving deep market penetration.
    - *Platform Expansion:* The ""pipeline in a product"" strategy will be activated, with the initiation of pivotal trials for efzofitimod in SSc-ILD and potentially other interstitial lung diseases.
    - *Next-Generation Pipeline:* The earlier-stage assets from the Physiocrine platform, such as ATYR0101, will be advanced into the clinic.
    - *Sustained Value Creation:* Through a combination of organic growth, strategic partnerships, and the potential for an ultimate acquisition at a premium valuation, I believe aTyr is positioned for a multi-year cycle of significant value creation for its shareholders.

---

In conclusion, the investment thesis for aTyr Pharma is not merely strong; I see it as overwhelmingly compelling, supported by a rare and powerful convergence of evidence across every analytical domain. The journey to this point has been long and meticulous. The final, transformative act is about to begin.

### Takeaways

As I wrap up this thesis, I want to come back to the reason I started all of this in the first place. The goal here isn’t to tell you what to buy or sell, or to try to move a stock. What I’ve tried to do is demonstrate what’s possible when you take a forensic, structured, and obsessively curious approach to research - when you dig into the details, connect the dots, and build your own lens for seeing through the noise.

If there’s one thing I hope you’ll take away, it’s that this process is available to anyone willing to put in the work. Whether you apply it to biotech or any other field, the methods, logic, and critical thinking are universal - and the gap between institutional and retail research is narrower than ever. My hope is that this project helps raise the bar for analysis, inspires more people to do deep, original work, and maybe even encourages a new standard of transparency in this space.

Thank you to everyone who’s read, engaged, challenged, and supported me. The growth of this community shows there’s real appetite for this kind of approach, and I’m genuinely grateful to be a part of it.

If you got value from this work, just take a second to think about what goes into it. Many people pay for subscriptions, research memberships, or think nothing of dropping hundreds of dollars on premium reports. Here, you’re getting months’ worth of analysis - hundreds of hours, genuinely - by just one person, for free. If you can spare $5, $10, $20, or even $50 to say thanks, that support really does make a difference and helps justify the late nights, weekends, and odd hours (from the other side of the world) I’ve put into building this for the community. Your contribution isn’t just about the coffee - it’s about backing the kind of research and transparency we need more of. If you’ve already supported, thank you so much. If you’re considering it, know it would be massively appreciated.

I can explain later, but I'm thankfully at the end of an excruciatingly long week. I think the 'other duties as assigned' are over-taking my actual duties at the office. I'm not even sure what my actual responsibilities are anymore.

With the long weekend nearly here, I plan to look busy enough to get to the end of the day.

That's where you come in. I don't get along with pretty much anyone in the office- everyone here is at least 10-15 years older than me, so we have nothing in common. Anyone want to chat all day about life, hobbies, and general queries about the universe?

Chats are always open. Who knows, maybe this will be a long-term thing?

1n3ac08,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n3ac08,And then the Angels sang such sweet succour,"I actually ate this for breakfast yesterday morning but work quickly became chaotic and then the two big losses yesterday afternoon did my day in. I sorta comforted myself with Sanford and Son and Parks and Recreation. This was my first and hopefully not last taste of the legendary Chocolate muesli. I will preface by saying that of the 4 or 5 Norwegian AFRs that I have eaten they have all been excellent and I wish we could get the drytech meals here. They only sell in Norway. 

These are fairly standard across the board in that you get an isotonic drink, the main, coffee, sugar, gum, disinfectant wipe, some kind of bar and/or meat stick. This also included some bridgeford wheat bread and nut creme. 

The coffee is a standard freeze dried coffee that is perfectly fine. I've had better and I've had worse. I added the sugar to it and it's a 5/10. The blueberry bar is a protein granola bar. It's a little bit drier than most granola bars I've eaten but it was just fine. A nice blueberry flavor and a 6.5/10. The wheat bread is meh, nothing special and had a slightly off flavor at the end of chewing for me. I give it a 4.5/10. I cut in half and put the nut creme on one and butter on the other. The nut creme is a chocolate hazelnut peanut spread more similar to Nutella rather than the MRE chocolate peanut butter. I gave it a good knead and spread it on the bread. It's a little more on the liquid side and there were really small nut pieces in. It still has a smooth texture and good flavor. It's a sweet edition to the meh bread and helps balance it out. I give the creme a 8/10. The peach drink...IYKYK. 10/10 every time. I would seriously buy cases of this to keep around the house and bring to work, etc. 

What can I say about this main? I made it with hot water and put just enough to get everything hydrated and then adjusted with a bit more to give it a more oatmeal like texture. Where has this been all my life? None of you should eat this because it is poisonous and I'm the only human being in existence that can properly dispose of it. So mail them all to me and I'll take care of them...my precious 💍. It has a rich chocolate flavor and isn't overly sweet. The texture was excellent but that is always subjective. Since muesli is closer to cereal than oatmeal it nevers gets goopy. It holds up well. The powdered milk gives it the just right creaminess it needs to compliment the chocolate. I emphatically give it a 10/10 and like the peach drink would order cases of it. 

Overall I give it a 9/10 mainly because of the bread. A nice meal at anytime of the day. If there are any Norwegian folks on here, how do we get drytech to sell here in the States? I really want to try the reindeer stew. It used to be in the NAFRs and was removed. MKR did a review. It's still listed on the website so maybe there is hope. Have a great weekend and for those that celebrate Labor Day here in the US, enjoy the long weekend. ",2,1756480895.0,MRE,0,1.0,False

A Tale from Gotham’s Enduring Light","Batman and the Idea Man: Twilight of the Mind

A Tale from Gotham’s Enduring Light

# Prologue: The Shadows Return

The city of Gotham, notorious for its shifting tides of darkness and inspiration, found itself in a rare moment of calm. The streets, long haunted by the specter of Edgar Loomis Bulb—once the Idea Man, now a fragile legend—were finally bathed in the golden hush of peace. Only Batman, sentinel of the city’s soul, understood how fragile that peace could be.

Edgar’s passing marked the close of an era. His notebooks, entrusted to Sarah, gathered dust atop her modest desk in the Gotham Institute of Cognitive Science. But Gotham’s story, like the city itself, was never truly finished. Just beyond the reach of its streetlights, new ambitions flickered.

# A Spark in the Dark

Sarah Bulb, now a respected neuroscientist, confronted each day with her grandfather's admonition echoing in her mind: “Humility is the safeguard of genius.” She kept the notebooks locked away—except for one, which she studied nightly, tracing Edgar’s spidery script as if decoding the pulse of invention itself.

The Institute thrived under her leadership, attracting minds from around the world. But with progress came envy. Rival labs, secret societies, and corporate entities—each sought Bulb’s remaining inventions, rumored to lie within Sarah’s reach. Rumors swirled of a shadowy syndicate known as The Tenebrous, a cabal whose members were anonymous, masked, and obsessed with the reclamation of lost genius.

It began with minor break-ins: a laptop missing, a file corrupted, a research assistant’s memory inexplicably blank. Sarah, ever vigilant, suspected a pattern. She confided in Batman, whose silent presence offered her solace and assurance.

# Echoes of the Past

Batman’s investigation turned up evidence of advanced neural manipulation—someone had adapted Animus’s stolen Nano Bulb technology. Traces led him to a remote warehouse on Gotham’s waterfront, where a clandestine auction was set to take place.

Under cover of darkness, Batman infiltrated the auction. The air was electric with anticipation as criminal bidders vied for Bulb’s “Final Equation”—an invention thought lost, but rumored to unlock the full creative potential of any mind. The device, however, was a fake—Sarah had orchestrated the auction as a trap, hoping to lure The Tenebrous into the open.

The syndicate’s leader, known only as Dr. Null, anticipated the ploy. Null was no ordinary adversary; a philosopher-scientist whose vision for Gotham rivaled Bulb’s, but whose methods were cold and utilitarian. Null’s manifesto was clear: “Gotham’s renaissance must be engineered. The era of inspired individuals is over. We will cultivate intellect… by any means necessary.”

# The New War of Minds

Sarah, Batman, and a small cadre of trusted allies—Lucius Fox, Commissioner Gordon, even the enigmatic Riddler—formed a council to counter The Tenebrous. They pooled their expertise, decoding Null’s communication channels and tracking his network of acolytes.

Null’s technology, a fusion of Bulb’s IQ Pin and Animus’s Nano Bulb, was insidious. Instead of siphoning intelligence, it could overwrite personality itself, converting Gotham’s brightest into compliant “thought-citizens.” As Null’s reach grew, scientists, artists, and thinkers began to disappear, only to resurface as shadows of themselves.

The council’s struggle became a race against time. Null’s real target was Sarah herself—the uncracked code to Bulb’s Final Equation. Only she possessed the intuition necessary to understand the device’s purpose: not domination, but inspiration. Bulb’s legacy, if rightly interpreted, could foster a city where every mind was empowered, not enslaved.

# The Chess Game

Batman anticipated Null’s approach and devised a plan—a chess game of intellect, played across Gotham itself. He laid traps, planted clues, and manipulated the city’s surveillance grid to expose Null’s movements.

Sarah accepted her role as Bulb’s heir and created a counter-device: the “Light Key,” a neural safeguard capable of restoring overwritten minds. But it required a test subject. Sarah volunteered, trusting Batman to intervene should anything go awry.

Null struck at the Gotham Institute, deploying his agents in a silent, surgical raid. The confrontation was swift and cerebral. Null unleashed his neural overwriter on Sarah, demanding the secrets of the Final Equation. But Sarah, prepared for this moment, activated the Light Key, flooding the network with Bulb’s original encryption—a code based not on arrogance, but compassion.

The feedback stunned Null’s agents, restoring their identities. Null himself, caught in a web of paradoxical logic derived from Bulb’s and Riddler’s riddles, was trapped in a digital maze of his own making.

# Resolution: The New Gotham

With Null apprehended and The Tenebrous dissolved, Gotham breathed anew. The council dispersed, but their friendship remained, forged in adversity and shared wisdom. Sarah, now the city’s leading scientific voice, founded the Bulb Foundation—dedicated not to invention, but to ethical inspiration.

Batman's role returned to the shadows, his vigilance undimmed. He visited Sarah only in moments of deepest need, reminding her that Gotham’s greatest strength was not its intellect, but its heart.

# Epilogue: The Last Notebook

Years passed. Gotham’s skyline shimmered with innovation, but its citizens remembered the cost of unchecked ambition. The legend of the Idea Man endured, retold in classrooms and coffee shops as a warning and a hope.

One evening, Sarah received a package—unmarked, save for a single bulb insignia. Inside, a notebook, its pages blank except for the opening line:

“The brightest ideas are those shared. Pass the light.”

Sarah smiled, and beneath Gotham’s twilight, she began to write her own story—one not just for herself, but for a city forever hungry for inspiration.

# Legacy: The Flicker and the Flame

Long after Batman’s cape vanished into Gotham’s night, the city remained a crucible for invention and redemption. Children built models inspired by Bulb’s diagrams, artists painted murals of the clock tower showdown, and scientists debated the ethics of progress in Bulb’s name.

And somewhere, deep within the Batcave, that single Bulb IQ Pin glowed faintly—a reminder that genius, when tempered by humility and compassion, could illuminate even Gotham’s darkest corners.",1,1756480797.0,MyDCComicsConceptsand,0,1.0,False

1n3a90v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChateauUnhinged/comments/1n3a90v/reddit_read/,Reddit Read?,"Having watched last night's vlog - almost a parody of itself - I was left with many observations, not least that comments here and in other places are definitely read by person or persons at Lalande.   Not that it was in doubt, but that there were too many 'bits that fit' last night.  It was, in a way, as though we were being teased!  
Some of my many observations, in no particular order. :  
**Refreshed format** \- No Weather Report.  No Dog Walk.  
**Vlogger's Time vs Real Time** \- Focus on Chris and his back problem and 'newly' returned to work, when he had posted about this days ago, and shown footage of him back at work.  
It was a Thursday night vlog - absence of the flower gathering and arranging, and initial food prep for B&B guests.  
**Bon Appetit -** only uttered once when Marie gave Steph her coffee\*\*.\*\*  
**Reduced clips of Philip -** could she finally be accepting that he is putting viewers off?  
**Cadeau at the Chateau? -** A flurry of activity to get everyone involved in opening and drooling over that extravagant gift of books. (I am not knocking the very generous giver and the books did look stunning.)  Who was the older lady on the sofa at the box opening?  
**Washing Up!** \- Stephanie, actually getting her hands wet, proving that the kitchen sink is probably not the best size for the job in hand and saying words to the effect of 'We have read comments about us handwashing our tableware, and don't we have a dishwasher?  We have two dishwashers!' blah blah blah...  
**Souffle Dishes -** a comment to justify Philip's spending on crockery.  
**Dress hoard clearance** \- again!  Showing of the 16th birthday dress, and reluctance to part with it - again!  
**Hard Hats** \- a pleasant addition to the LaLande wardrobe and long overdue.  Guess they were bought for patron day.  Only surprise was that they didn't have a logo. Maybe Philip could 'design' a range of protective clothing and workwear to raise funds for the grand salon!  (If you're reading Pip, I'd like my cut.)  
**Visit from the previous owners** \- it was good to see them, and their honest reactions to their former home, trying to take in all the changes.  It would have been good to see more of that, perhaps including the chapel. Notice Philip was on hand to show off his superior knowledge whilst wearing the dog as though it was one his scarf creations.  
**Theme songs** \- thankfully we're not being bombarded with them on every episode, unlike many of us feared.  Perhaps they are going to produce a limited edition album of them to sell as Christmas gifts and raise money for the JarvisJansen coffers.

If you've got to the end of this post, well done.  I'm sure you will have seen things that I've either overlooked or forgotten. I look forward to reading them.

Over the past few months, I’ve had the chance to test this product daily, and I'll admit it has made a noticeable difference in our household's drinking water. The combination of user-friendly features and its ability to reduce TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) makes it a practical option for families, but it’s definitely not without its quirks.

**Sleek Design and Practical Dimensions**  
In terms of design, this replacement filter is straightforward yet efficient. Measuring 4.29”D x 4.29”W x 13.8”H, it fits perfectly under most countertops without taking up excessive space. Weighing about 2.43 pounds, it’s light enough to handle and install without breaking a sweat. Its neutral aesthetic doesn’t scream for attention, so it subtly blends into my kitchen setup. However, its minimalist design does nothing to indicate when it's time for a replacement unless you’re adept at monitoring filter life manually.

**Good Aspects**  
- Effective at reducing TDS, improving overall water taste and clarity.  
- Lightweight and compact, making installation a breeze.  
- Compatible with Bluevua reverse osmosis systems, so integration is seamless.  

[Check Bluevua RO100ROPT-Lite price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0bhn4gh35/)  

**Understanding Its Functionality**  
Even with numerous filters out there, the simplicity of this one stands out. It’s tailored specifically for the Bluevua reverse osmosis system, ensuring compatibility isn’t a guessing game. Once installed, it works hard at reducing impurities, ensuring pure, clean drinking water flows effortlessly. Since I use filtered water for cooking, drinking, and even making coffee, the difference in taste was apparent immediately. It wasn't just me who noticed either; my kids seem to drink more water now, which is a subtle win.

**Key Benefits of Using This Product**  
- Enhanced water quality is noticeable after just a few uses.  
- Installation is user-friendly, even for individuals who've never swapped out a filter before.  
- SGS-certified testing ensures a layer of trust regarding reliability.  

Still, it’s fair to point out that the filter doesn’t come with any built-in indicators to show when it’s time for a swap, something other products in its category might offer. For active families like mine, that subtle difference could prevent unexpected gaps in filter efficiency.

**Possible Caveats**  
- No replacement indicators, so manual monitoring is required.  
- Designed for Bluevua systems only, making it less versatile for those with other reverse osmosis brands.  

**Rival Brands in the Industry**  
When weighed against competing products like APEC, AquaTru, or even Brita’s advanced filter options, the Bluevua system holds its own. In terms of TDS reduction, it mirrors the efficiency of AquaTru’s offerings but at a fraction of the complexity. Brita’s systems, while compact and versatile, just don’t deliver the same level of purification. The downside? APEC models, although pricier, tend to include filter replacement alarms and longer filter life, something the Bluevua replacement sacrifices. 

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
The pricing for this filter feels justified when you consider its results. While it occupies more of a middle-ground price range in the replacement filter market, its combination of performance and purity makes it worthwhile. Investing in something that guarantees a higher quality of water pays dividends in the long run, especially if you’re trying to reduce bottled water purchases.

Want to hear from actual trans people.","Yesterday, I (MTF, 31) passed out at work. I was low on sleep, hadn't eaten in a few days, was dehydrated, had too much caffeine, and had taken a new bus route that let off further from my place of employment than I thought--which would be fine at a different time of year, but in August, on a particularly humid day...

Not to mention, 5+ years of coursing Estrogen have changed my tolerance for heat.

Yeah, yeah, kinda my fault. Been having a rough time.

Anyway, I arrive at my place of work, and with in like 2 minutes of waiting outside to come in, I apparently pass the fuck out.

I come back to consciousness, and security has called paramedics. I try really hard to get them not to take me anywhere--I'm uninsured. I've also had some bad experiences with public safety since I came out and transitioned so many years ago--I had a similar fainting episode at a bus stop a year prior, and I was very definitely assumed to be a drugged-out sex worker (didn't help that my dress ripped in the process, my makeup was running down my face thanks to sweat, and I didn't have a permanent address at the time). Not that there is anything wrong with sex workers, it's just not what you want police to suspect you to be.

Despite my protests (I don't blame my boss at ALL for this), I'm carted into the ambulance and driven to a nearby hospital. I start vomiting pretty bad (it's all black coffee, yay!). We make it to the hospital, attach me to an IV, and the questions start.

Now, this is where the problems begin. See, the whole time until now, everybody has just assumed I'm a cis woman. That's how I'm treated at work (love my jobs), and EMTs/security/fire didn't act any differently. These are obviously people over never met, which is kinda part for the course these days. I guess this part is nice. They have no idea I'm trans. They don't do this mythical ""what is your gender"" thing that 'phobes think has corrupted our society. For the people who say they ""can always tell"": cool, but no.

So I'm in a room, and look, I've been trying to subtly hint. Just in case it may be necessary medical information, and also, sometimes people get pretty mean when they think they've been \*tricked\*. So I'm trying to discretely drop hints.. My legal name is different than my actual name (the change takes money), and the old one, while not the \*most\* masculine, is still more commonly a man's name (hence the change). And they are just NOT picking up what I'm putting down. Nurses are helping me get situated into a hospital gown (my brand new shirt is literally 100% soaked through with sweat), which obviously isn't helping me correct any assumptions because there's a bra and, like, the parts of the body that fill a bra under there. I'm being asked questions, they're doing tests, and we get to (I don't remember the exact phrasing, I was kinda out of it) questions about pregnancy. And I'm insistent that I can't be pregnant, because like, well, medical technology sure isn't there yet. But they badger me a bit there. I get more insistent. I'm not yelling--I really couldn't at the moment if I tried--but I do start laughing a little. Get some weird looks, but eventually, most of the nurses leave.

I assume that's the end of it. We do the rest of the tests, I'm given a ton of fluids and some potassium, and so many hours later, I'm discharged with a packet of test results and the strong insistence to take better care of myself. Fine, I deserve that.

I'm looking over what they tested this morning, because I'm trying to figure out how financially f\*\*\*ed I am, and low and behold, they ran a pregnancy test. Lower and beholder, it came back negative.

Now this is the part where I'm wondering if I'd be the asshole. On the one hand, I really don't want to pay for it, and they didn't listen to or believe me. On the other hand, I think this could have been solved if I'd been more forward explaining that I'm trans. It just like didn't come up, and wouldn't without strongarming the issue, which tends to, y'know, make people hostile. There's a fair argument to be made that this is my chickens coming home to roost.

So... would it be fair for me to protest the charge?",2,1756480391.0,trans,2,1.0,False

# Overview

I am a classically studied developer with roughly 8 years of backend web experience. Tilk is my first foray into game development, minus a short stint creating a Pokemon Emerald rom hack for the proposal to my wife. Coincidentally, Tilk was also created for her, as she really loves word games. The rom hack was a fantastic way to get started. It felt exactly like it did when I first started programming websites - make a change and then see its effects immediately.

My wife was deep into Wordle and all of its clones, so when choosing a first project, a word game felt like the right scope. As a bonus, I had my first player right next to me. To focus purely on learning the engine without need of game design, I researched existing word puzzles. Tilk is a pretty standard digital implementation of the [dropquote puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropquote). Surprisingly or unsurprisingly, there is a lack of digital adaptations of this puzzle type, so it was a clear choice.

I started development of Tilk in January and got it to a releasable point in mid-April. Naively, I had initially targeted March as my goal for release. I still think I could’ve hit that if I had cut certain features. For example, I spent a day or two getting controllers and remappable buttons set up, and of course, a few disparate hours setting up focus neighbors. However, I chose to give Tilk the “full treatment” because this was supposed to be a learning opportunity and if I couldn’t do things fully and “correctly” in a game as small as this then what hope was there for a bigger game?

There are countless one-off videos or articles, but here are some shout-outs for resources I consumed over the course of development:

* [StayAtHomeDev](https://www.youtube.com/@stayathomedev) \- good tutorials, but I really love his showcase videos. They were great for reigniting motivation when I was in a slump
* [DevWorm](https://www.youtube.com/@dev-worm) \- Easy to follow tutorials
* [CoffeeCrow](https://www.youtube.com/@CoffeeCrowDev) \- Solid videos on accessibility settings and configuring keybindings
* [Godot Shaders](https://godotshaders.com/) \- shader library
* [GameUIDatabase](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/index.php) \- screenshots and videos from *many* games, good for inspiration

# Surprising Challenges

Implementing a guided tutorial was one of the harder features. How do you even search “tutorial on creating a tutorial?” My solution was to create an InputRestrictor node that would act as a wall, swallowing user input that wasn’t targeting specifically allowed nodes. I will gladly accept suggestions on other solutions because I don’t know if this is a feasible solution outside of UI heavy games.

The save system is JANK. By the time I realized how bad it was, it had embedded itself in too many places to fix given how small this game is. Time for the duct tape and to just leave it as lessons learned.

IOS in app purchasing. Why, oh why, is there not a good built-in solution? I ended up using [this plugin](https://github.com/zt-pawer/SwiftGodotIosPlugins/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file), but I would **much** prefer a first-party solution.

# My Thoughts on Godot

The engine is fantastic. The node structure can feel close to web development, which made it easy for me to learn. I have not tried Unity or Unreal and at this point, I don’t necessarily feel the need to. Godot is getting the job done for me and with the increase in community size, I can assume it will only get better from here.

I wish animating UIs was more flexible. I use containers everywhere to make my UIs responsive, but this destroys any chance of using the animation player. It’s not the end of the world to use Tweens, but viewing an animation within the animation player is just so much nicer than loading the game.

# Advice

1. Just get started. If you don’t care for a small, full-feature project, create a playground project with many scenes exploring mechanics you enjoy playing.
2. Spend the time to make a level editor. The few hours I spent on that saved me *many* hours of tedious resource creation and testing each resource afterwards since I could see the level right then and there.
3. Become familiar with Tweens, AnimationPlayer, and shaders. These 3 really add life and weight to game actions.
4. If you’re in a mid-project slump, drop it for a week. Go play a game from your backlog, listen to your favorite OST, or doom-scroll asset packs on itch. Breaks are important to reignite motivation.

Thanks to everyone who’s made a post, video, or comment about Godot. And of course, thank you for making it this far in this long post.

1n3a1vj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlaskaAirlines/comments/1n3a1vj/policy_regarding_downgrading_already_seated/,Policy regarding downgrading already seated passenger?,"This is a new one for me. Caveat: I'm not the passenger, but I'm in direct contact with the passenger. And she's being a very good sport about it. Possibly even kinder than I might be, depending on my mood. 

She is 100k on AS, like me.  She is flying to Texas today.  She booked a fully paid ticket, but it was in main cabin.  Prior to arriving at the airport, she got the good news email.  Her app also updated and showed that she had a seat in first class. 

(Now I know what you're thinking: ""yeah, that's never a guarantee, and sometimes you go to board and find out that they've changed equipment or something has happened with the past year manifest or there's a crew member deadheading or hell, and Air Marshall, or something.  And before you walk down the Jack bridge, you're being handed a disappointing boarding pass. This wasn't that... read on.) 

She boarded with the premium group at the gate, and was *seated in first class* for over 10 minutes.  Was served a coffee and everything. 

Then, prior to the doors closing, Alaska staff informed her: ""We have some other passengers on this flight who are dashing here just now due to a late arriving connection... Please vacate any first class seats for the people who were originally ticketed for them.""

She was removed from her first class seat and placed back in the main cabin.  (And presumably someone in that row seven seat would have also been moved back elsewhere on the plane since I assumed they also got a little mini upgrade to premium)

Again, I'm sympathetic to various parties involved here. If I was the original seat holder, I'd be a little miffed if I wasn't in the first class cabin, especially if I had paid for and booked it.

I also have a little sympathy for the Alaska staff. A business traveler not getting the seat they paid for would possibly give them the bollocking of a lifetime and that wouldn't be enjoyable.

However, it is my understanding that many airlines have a policy of ""once the butt is in the seat, it takes an act of god to move the passenger out of that seat"" (remember the fiasco with United and the passenger they bludgeoned trying to pull them off the plane?) 

Frankly, if I were one of the late arriving guests I like to think I would simply be gracious and grateful that I was making my connection whatsoever. Also, this was a domestic hop of limited duration. If someone was on an international, missing out on a lay flat bed or something, that's different. 

Anyway, ultimately the person who forced her out of her seat (possibly the gate agent?) didn't apologize, but it sounds like the cabin crew does feel bad and is trying to get her information in order to give her some sort of compensation. 

What do you all think? What would you have like to have seen done? And my main question: is there a specific written Alaska policy surrounding these situations?

1n3a1aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/1n3a1aw/my_first_time_riding_from_south_calgary_to/,My First Time Riding From South Calgary to Downtown,"As someone new to Calgary, I’ve been curious about how accessible downtown is by bike from the deep south (I’m in Legacy). With knees that feel twice my age, a regular pedal bike was never an option. However, when I got the chance to try out an e-bike ([Surface 604 Quad](https://calgaryebikes.ca/products/surface-604-quad-2021) from eBikes Calgary), I figured it was time to find out.

# The Route

I left Legacy with 93% battery and headed north. The path wound through Chaparral into Fish Creek Park, where I immediately learned that pedal assist doesn’t protect you from mosquitos. The shaded paths, bridges, and riverside stretches made it a surprisingly scenic ride.

Cutting under the C-Train tracks and weaving between overpasses gave the whole thing an unexpected urban-meets-nature vibe. I stopped a couple times for photos where I found the contrast of quiet trails against the industrialism of over-passes and train tracks drew a nice parallel.

Crossing Glenmore/Anderson, I stuck to the dedicated bike paths all the way into Stanley Park. This was my first visit, and it felt like a hidden gem: smooth pathways, quiet neighborhoods, and spots where you can just pull over and look out over the Elbow River. It’s the kind of place I’ll definitely ride again, especially with a coffee stop nearby.

From there, it was a short cruise into downtown where I called it my halfway point and grabbed some celebratory A&W before heading back.

# The Ride Back

The return trip had a very different feel. Those fun downhill stretches on the way north became long, steady climbs going south. At \~225 lbs (plus a backpack stuffed with camera gear, water, and tools), the battery percentage started dropping faster than I’d like. By the time I crossed Stoney Trail, the eBike finally gave up with 5 km to go.

Pushing a 65-lb dead e-bike uphill is no joke. Every incline felt twice as long without pedal assist, and by the time I rolled back into Legacy, I’d been thoroughly humbled.

That said, I wasn’t the only one suffering. A friend joined me on a regular pedal bike, and while my battery died near the end, he was already running out of gas way earlier. The e-bike quitting was frustrating, but even with that, I still finished stronger than he did. If anything, it proved just how much farther you can realistically go on an e-bike and how much more enjoyable the ride is along the way.

# What I Learned About Calgary’s Pathways

* The network is surprisingly intuitive, even for someone new.  
* Signage and markers kept me on track when cutting through neighborhoods.  
* The paths were clean, smooth, and well maintained.  
* The vibe was good: joggers, walkers, and cyclists all shared space without stress.  

# What I Learned About E-Bikes

This was my first real e-bike ride, and a few things stood out:

* Range isn’t guaranteed: I started at 93%, hit 53% downtown, and the bike died just shy of 50 km. To be fair, I stayed in the higher assist modes the whole time because… assist is fun, especially for dreadful climbs.  
* Weight matters: pushing 250 lbs including gear definitely shortened the range.  
* Even when the battery had enough of my riding style, the ride up until then was way more enjoyable than it would’ve been on a normal bike.  

The big takeaway? An e-bike didn’t “make it easy,” but it made it possible. Without it, I never would’ve tried this route. With it, I got to explore huge stretches of Calgary I’d never seen before and have fun doing it.

# Conclusion

Calgary’s pathway system surprised me. You can get from the far south to downtown almost entirely on paved paths without touching the road. For anyone thinking about trying a ride like this, it’s not just doable but genuinely enjoyable.

And for e-bikes? I’m sold. Not because they’re effortless, but because they open up rides that would’ve been off-limits otherwise.

TL;DR: Rode from Legacy to downtown and back (\~50 km) on an e-bike. Trails were smooth and well-marked. Battery started at 93%, dropped to 53% downtown, and died with 5 km left. Ended up pushing a 65-lb bike home but still had more gas left than my buddy on a regular bike.

Some days I can handle a busy coffee shop and multiple conversations, other days even a phone call with my brother feels like too much stimulation.

I've started noticing it's not just about the intensity of the situation - sometimes quiet one-on-one time with friends leaves me more overstimulated than a louder group setting. There seem to be patterns I'm missing about what makes certain social interactions work for my nervous system vs what overwhelms it.

Ingredients
* 2 vanilla beans / 1 tbs vanilla paste
* 276ml milk 
* 120g  sugar (140g if you want more sweetness)
* 56g cake flour ( I like 40g cake flour and 16g  bread flour)
* 28g butter 
* 1 eggs (~56g)
* 1 egg yolks (~22g)
* 30ml dark rum
For the mold coating:
* 10 g butter (melt)
Instructions
* Slit the vanilla beans lengthwise, and scrape the seeds from them with a small knife. Put the seeds, vanilla pods, and milk in a saucepan, and bring them to a gentle simmer, then turn off the heat and add butter. OR milk in a saucepan and bring it to a gentle simmer, add butter and vanilla paste. Let it cool down to ~ 50°C
* In a separate bowl, mix the flour and sugar . Adding mixture of egg and egg yolk ( don’t over mix). Add melted butter and milk mixture until combined (don’t over mix).
* Filter the batter twice. Refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours. The texture and flavor improved. The batter may be kept in a fridge for up to 4 days. Each time you use the batter, add the dark rum, stir it well and filter it again. 
* For this, melt the butter, applying a thin layer into a mold, and then turn upside down the mold on a paper towel underneath to catch drippings, do it twice. Once cooled down, chill in a freezer or a refrigerator until ready to bake.
* Preheat oven to 230°C. Fill the molds with 70-80g batter ( 1 cm from the top of the mode). Bake them at 230°C for 15 minutes. Without opening the oven, drop the temperature to 200°C and continue baking for another 45-50 minutes. Every oven is different, so your baking times may need to be adjusted. (Convection bake is better)
* Remove caneles from the oven. Quickly unmold them and place them on a cooling rack upside down. Caneles usually slide right out of their molds, but if they don't, turn the mold upside down and knock on a hard surface, such as a cutting board.
* Let cool for at least 40 minutes at room temperature. Caneles must be eaten on the day they are baked. Or keep frozen, reheat at 180°C for 10 minutes, let it cool down again.

We are kinda all over the place and have thought about embracing the cold and chasing northern lights in Norway but could completely change and go for a warmer destination such as Costa Rica. We need help so please pitch us some ideas for destinations during this week! 

Some things about us…we have been to Switzerland in the past during the summer, and our only other real trip was to Vermont in the fall. We live by Philadelphia currently but are from New Jersey and New York City. We like “active” excursions such as hiking but also want to have some balance to the trip and maybe do more slow “self-care” type of activities if the place has that. We don’t really drink or go out to clubs/party but more so enjoy exploring coffee, food, and culture in places. We don’t necessarily want/need the place to have huge Christmas-forward events since both Philly and NYC have holiday activities that we have done. We were thinking of going abroad, but are open to a domestic trip in the United States as well. Please help us decide what to do and where we should go!

We separated. We agreed that we would only talk about coparenting stuff. We agreed we were no longer friends, but we would remain civil to coparent. It was all discussed and agreed MONTHS ago.

We have been civil but he has been... difficult. Mostly just weird passive aggressive stuff, especially after I started dating.

When he moved out, a mutual friend of ours suggested we start a group chat for us to communicate coparenting stuff through, with our mutual friend sitting in as a mediator of sorts, only stepping in to ensure boundaries are kept to ensure all communication was civil. For example, I asked my ex if he could watch our daughter, and my ex asked me what I was doing, and our friend pitched in to say that information was not necessary - he didn't need to know what I was doing, he just needed to confirm if he was able to watch our daughter.

This mutual friend has made it clear he is on neither of our sides, he is just there to make sure neither of us says anything that will complicate the divorce process. Side note: we are not divorced yet because divorce is expensive. I am saving up as much as I can every month and I am almost there.

At first this was going well but then my ex went back to messaging me privately. At first it was coparenting stuff so I just replied. Then he started making passive aggressive comments. For example he sent me a random text asking me what I was doing. I ignored it. The next morning he sent a snotty text saying 'Never mind, I can guess what you're doing, or rather WHO'. I ignored that one as well, and he went back to normal, using the group chat.

It's not every day. Sometimes he'll go days and it'll all be normal communication that we agreed. Then he'll flip out and be passive aggressive. Or sometimes he won't text me at all for days, and then I'll get some passive aggressive nightmare.

Every time he would make one of his comments, I would tell him to please talk on the group chat and then ignore him. When he started messaging me with coparenting stuff privately, I continued the conversation on the group chat. If its anything other than coparenting, I just don't respond.

Although it sucked, I felt I could manage it. I hoped he would eventually calm down, especially as the gaps between his weird texts got longer and longer, so I thought he'd stop soon.

But... it just escalated further and now he has been trying to get me to go out to coffee with him or he wants to meet up because he wants to talk. He won't say about what, only that he wants to 'catch up'. And now he has escalated further to calling me multiple times.

I have repeatedly told him no.

I don't know if this is all a pretence to ask to get back together or if he's lonely and wanting to talk to somebody familiar, but either way I am not interested.

How do I get him to stop?

I have asked him repeatedly to use the group chat. I have told him repeatedly that I only want to talk about coparenting. I have told him repeatedly that I do not want to catch up, get coffee or anything like that. I am trying my best to keep this civil and calm for our daughter's sake. I thought when he moved out that he would calm down but if anything he's gotten worse.

If it helps, I did take screen shots and would be happy to share I just cannot figure out how to include them in my post.

You won't notice it much, but it could be a possible explanation for why I can be weird from time (this shouldn't be an excuse by the way) Since we got that out of the way, *let us dive more into my persona*

 

***My persona***

I live in Central Europe, so due to my origin I'm able to speak German as well as English. I'm of Caucasian ethnicity, I have white skin, an average build at a height of 175 cm (or 5 ft 9 in) have medium-short brown hair on top, green-grey eyes with glasses on rare occasions & a short stubble face to round things off

 

***My lifestyle***

My occupation is something I can be very passionate about & really enjoy on a deep basis. When I'm not active due to work, I love to be active in my free time by going to the gym, going for a run or biking for example. Something I like to pair these activities with is listening to music or to a good podcast, but I usually prefer to watch rather than just listen to them. During the day I really love to drink a good cup of coffee somewhere or at home, so one day I will definitely buy myself a barista coffee machine. Currently I live on an omnivore diet, I like to cook & try different recipes. Next to that I have interests in psychology, philosophy, medicine, health & science to name a few

 

***My preferences***

I'm here looking for a female who is open to a long-term relationship aged between 18 - 28. Preferably from Europe, but I'm also open to females from (North) America. I want someone who is able to participate in a normal conversation & is emotionally available. Last but not least, someone who looks after their health & therefore has no emotional (lingering) baggage & maintains a rational normal weight

Ill give you the cliff notes of my life leading up to the surgeries.

If you want the info on post op today, scroll down to the first comment. Main post is cliffs of my life story.

**2002:** begin bodybuilding as a 17 year old. Same year I started getting random occurrences of issues swallowing my food. I'd sit in the bathroom spitting it up. As a kid I didnt think anything of it and went on with my life. It only happened twice between 17-18 years old. I believe this is when I got my hiatal hernia.

**2004-2005:** I start having symptoms of esophagus damage and of course, still being young and dumb, I didnt really think much of it. Due to acid damaging my esophagus (didnt know it was that at the time), it would sometimes close up to the size of a pea and I couldnt swallow food or water. I would just wait it out and let the inflammation die down. I would typically eat meats with excess condiments to help it go down.

**2005-2010:** During those four years I would have weekly occurrences that my esophagus would close up due to it always being slightly enflamed. I had yet to start any type of elimination diet. I would merely ""roll with the punches"" and ignore it....very dumb I know. I had also been scoped twice and never was suggested I see a gut specialist or really do anything. The hospital would release me and set me on my way.

**2010-2011:** At this time in my life Im now in a serious relationship, living with my now wife of 15 years. So at this point Im getting a third party observer to the madness of what Ive been putting up with solo for all these years and she suggests I see a doctor. She got really bad experience early on when she had to take me to the hospital to get scoped because my esophagus wouldn't relax, even after 12 hours. That was an early relationship experience she had with me.

**2012-2016:** At this point Ive seen a couple specialists and I had done every test known to man trying to figure out what was wrong with me...besides an endoscopy, which I still had no clue existed. Neither of my gut specialists even suggested it. After blood work and stool samples they came to the conclusion I had EoE (esophagitis). So at this point I start to do an elimination diet and learn that dairy was the #1 culprit for my issues. So the years of protein shakes and dairy products I would ingest daily as a Bodybuilder, they would cause my esophagus to always stay enflamed.

**2013/2014-2022:** With my elimination diet in place I start to feel great, minimal to no issues sleeping or eating. Diary being the main culprit, I felt very good at this point. No other symptoms had really start to show themselves yet. At this point, up to even today, my esophagus hasnt closed up on me again. I've gained control of that aspect of my life.

**2022-2025:** I finally decide to see a proper gastro specialist that is good at his job. I decide I want to dig deeper into my issues. This is when he does a biopsy of my esophagus and scopes me and finds my hiatal hernia. He also finds out that I do NOT have esophagitis. Instead hes told me I have a 2.5-3cm Hiatal Hernia and I've had silent relux for years. Due to this, I have Barrets esophagus. He told me, the chances are high that those symptoms you first had at 17 years old, that was when I first got the hernia and started having acid damage my esophagus.

**Feb 2025:** Tennessee has its first big snow and my wifes like ""lets go outside and do some sledding"". Im game for that! 30 minutes outside was enough for the both of us in sub 15 degree weather. I come inside and go to the gym and proceed with my normal day. The next day, I start to notice shortness of breath. and some subtle shallow breathing. I dont think much of it on day one but it continued to get worse as the week went on so now Im getting worried. At this point I can no longer lay down to sleep. Im getting heart palpitations and shortness of breath constantly. Apparently extreme cold can trigger a hiatal hernia to become worse, kinda like a light switch...it just happens. I also was abusing caffeine more than I had ever done. I was ingesting around 1000mg probably 5 days a week. Sipping on coffee and energy drinks like it was water. Not knowing caffeine relaxes the sphincter of the stomach. I had been abusing caffeine for over a year at this point

My first thought is my heart...Im having heart problems. So the first thing I do is spend 3 months getting every heart test and vascular scan I can get to rule out my heart or lunges are the issue. Good news on that is I have ZERO calcium/ plague build up, my heart is in mint condition, and my lunges are 100%. The bad news is, that means I need to go back to my gut specialst.

So spring is pretty much here and my gastro specialist says he wants to see how my body will react to a PPI. To be clear, I had to eliminate my heart being an issue before I could dive into it being my ""gut"". I begin a PPI and for the first 8 weeks, it does a great job of subduing the heart palpitations and shortness of breath, however I still cant lay down to sleep. I've been sleep at almost a 90 degree angle since February. So summer is here and after 8 weeks of my PPI (dexilent generic brand) out of no where I start getting diarrhea over the course of 5-7 days. I stopped the PPI and I got better but had to resort to now only taking pepcid (femodidine 40mg twice a day) but it didnt work nearly as good as the dex.

Heres where the decision is made that getting my hernia repaired and the TIF procedure come in. My gastro specialist was quick to tell me that those procedures are the best bet to fix the problem, especially since no PPIs react well, long term, with my body.

It took about 2 months after seeing both doctors that would be performing the surgeries to finally have it done. The surgeon that did my hiatal hernia had done hundreds of them and also doesn bariatric work as his specialty. The doctor that did my TIF procedure is Gary Olds, I was his 13th TIF patient.

They felt scattered, tired, and had tried dozens of routines without anything sticking.

Instead of designing another complicated system, we agreed on something so small it almost felt pointless; take a ten-minute walk each morning after coffee.

At first it was just that, a short walk. But slowly, it started to ripple. They noticed they were less groggy mid-morning. Calls went better because they were sharper. Over time, they started to see themselves differently:, not as someone failing to be “disciplined,” but as someone who could follow through.

That shift mattered more than the walk itself. It was living proof that consistency was possible and once they had that proof, bigger changes didn’t feel impossible anymore.

Budget is around 1000$ for both grinder and possible espresso machine. 

Currently I do pour overs every morning with V60 and an old conical Bodum grinder. With all the labour day sales (here in Canada) I want to buy a proper espresso set up, or at least a nice grinder (and buy an espresso machine later, like black friday).

My current thoughts are between a Eureka Mignon Zero (440$) or the DF64 (475$). Both are currently on sale. Im leaning closer to the Eureka because of the brand history, it's slightly cheaper and I like how it is a little quieter. I hate the noise of my current coffee grinder.

Does the 55mm to 64mm burr actually make a difference between the two?

AND THEN... I was also looking at bundles of grinder+machines. My budget is around 1000$, as I am currently a student and cant ball out right now. I was thinking getting the Breville Bambino Plus for \~500$ (on sale as well) or a Gaggia Classic pro e24 (830$). I absolutely LOVE the look of the gaggia, but for learning and ease of use (and price), Im leaning towards the breville. I also do early mornings for work and class so the 3sec start up time on the Breville seems very nice.

\- I had the colpo last October, which came back with CIN 2/3 (which my gyno was very surprised by because my pap was 'normal'!) 

\- I had another colpo in April, with four cervical biopsies and one ECC. All of it came back benign, no sign of CIN or dysplasia. 

In between April and October, I completely swore off sex and changed my entire diet to be less inflammatory (no alcohol, no coffee, less sugar, etc). I attributed my healed CIN to these diet changes + time.

I’ve (21f) liked N (24m)  pretty much since I met him, but J got to him first so I kept silent. I was a friend to him, but I’d see the smiles he’d give when she wasn’t around, the way his eyes sparkled when I drew on his arm, the jokes we’d crack at work, the way we’d check on each other after service. He would check me out at work, and at the apartment. But also when we were all hanging out and drinking that day as well as when we went to breakfast. He had been cold towards me for a while and I think J and E would talk shit on me to him, and he didn’t want to go against what J said so he believed her. He came down to see me, made out with me and touched me. He held me when I cried because of something he asked, went silent on me, then we started talking again between his birthday and mine. He came to the carnival with me at the end of June, paid for me to play darts and I won a plushy, and he played two more games to win me two more. He picked me up when I cried, and made me get off my ankle for a while (I had hurt it at work earlier that day) and let me rest it on his legs. We held hands as we walked and he was so gentle with me, but then I got a text from him “Snowman pissed me off” and he’s been a bit distant since. I don’t know if it’s something I did or not, but I miss him and I want to see him, so so so so badly

We all; me, him, and her, went bowling together after getting coffee for our friend’s birthday. While we were in his car, he kept stealing glances at me and I sang with him. She was hyping the two of us up and he kept giving me his vape without me asking for it. When we got to the bowling alley and started the game, he and I got competitive. It turned into playful banter between the two of us and when I said without thinking after a bad throw “ew, that was shit” and they both overheard me and her being the pick me she was, started saying it after every turn she took to get attention. I had started limping badly and he started bowling for me and glared at me until I got off my ankle. He wanted to carry me to his car but didn’t, and drove slower and avoided potholes so it wouldn’t jostle my ankle. He tried to carry me inside but I wouldn’t let him so instead he got me ice.

I had a pretty bad accident back in February. I was emotional and in a dark place, and ended up hitting ice. I lost a bit of control, got it back and then lost it a second time worse than the first time. I spun, went up an embankment, and slid down a bit. I had hit my shoulder and ankle on my door, my glasses flew off my face, and my head hit my seat and my door. My side airbags had deployed and I didn’t know who to call, that could get there quickly, so I called him. He didn’t answer at first (which he later admitted to regretting) but by the time he did, I told him what happened and that I needed a ride. He met me where I crashed (I was in an ambulance getting checked out) and he brought me to his car (I was showing signs of a concussion so he helped me walk) and then drove me home. He had carried me inside (which had caused arguments between us previous times he wanted to carry me) and got me water and pain meds before giving me a hug and going home. A few days after that I had asked him to drive me an hour away to meet my mom at a store (I didn’t have a backup car at the time) and I ended up having a panic attack and he notices and rolled the window down, slowed down, talked me through it, and gave me his vape without me even asking for it. He had cracked jokes, sang with me, and made sure I was okay the entire drive. And when we got to the store, I told him I’d go in and wait for my mom and he said “I’m not leaving you here until I know she’s here”. And he also saw a dirty frozen Baja blast from Taco Bell and said “my dumbass thought Taco Bell started serving margaritas, it’s just a frozen baja blast with half and half”







Everything I did for him, I did because I cared. Not only because I liked him. The monsters I’d get without being asked, checking on him, sending little encouraging gifts and texts, drawing on his arm, giving hugs, it was because I knew he was struggling and I wanted to help








He picked me up from my friend’s lake house and took me to his apartment. At first we just talked (I had a breakdown and he held me through it all), then we laid on his bed and cuddled while watching beauty and the beast, then we watched Aladdin and I was bratting and he did the booktok thing (grabbed my throat) and he ate me out and fingered me. He made sure I was comfortable the whole time. He also massaged my back and shoulders for me, and kissed up my back. I kept having these weird episodes where my eyes would roll into the back of my head and I’d go forward. He also was trying to distract me from the pain in my ankle, and he thinks it’s broken. We also ended up watching rio and he fell asleep, but I was up all night shaking and spazzing, and trying to not sob in pain. When he woke up, we made out again, I touched him (I have trauma around that so it was a big deal for me) and I laid on top of him before he drove me back. He called me princess, kissed my forehead, massaged my back, let me rest my bad ankle on him, called me beautiful, carried me a couple times, let me be little, and cared for me more than just sexually. And he thinks my ankle is broken, and wishes I could get it looked at. He also let me “teeth” on his hand and suck his thumb. We marked each other, and when I got insecure about my stomach and my scars, he called me beautiful and said I was healthy and skinny. And he kept calling me princess and kissing the top of my head and my forehead. He also rubbed his hands up and down my back in a comforting gesture

*Discovering the wisdom in trusting the bigger picture when our own understanding falls short*

---

## When Life Doesn't Make Sense 🤔

Picture this: You're driving through fog so thick you can barely see the hood of your car. Every instinct screams to stop, turn around, or find another route. Yet sometimes, the safest choice is to trust the GPS and keep moving forward slowly, even when you can't see what's ahead.

Life often feels exactly like this foggy drive. We encounter situations that make zero sense from our limited viewpoint. A job rejection that devastates us. A relationship that ends unexpectedly. A health challenge that derails our plans. In these moments, our natural response is to question, resist, or try to force a different outcome.

But what if there's a larger navigation system at work? What if the apparent detours and roadblocks are actually part of a more sophisticated route that we simply can't see from our current position?

## The Limits of Our Perspective 👁️

Human beings are fascinating creatures, but we're also remarkably limited in our ability to see the full picture. Consider these everyday examples:

**The Myopic Manager**: Sarah worked tirelessly for a promotion, only to be passed over for someone with less experience. She felt betrayed and considered quitting. Six months later, her company went through massive layoffs - but her department was spared because the new manager had connections that protected the entire team.

**The Delayed Flight**: Mike missed his connecting flight due to a delayed departure, ruining his vacation plans. Frustrated and exhausted, he rebooked for the next day. Later, he learned that his original flight had been diverted due to severe weather, leaving passengers stranded at a remote airport for 18 hours.

**The Rejected Manuscript**: Emma's novel was rejected by twelve publishers. Heartbroken, she shelved the project for two years. When she finally revised it, incorporating lessons learned from other writing experiences, it became a bestseller with the thirteenth publisher.

These stories illustrate a fundamental truth: our immediate perspective is often like looking at a massive puzzle while holding just one piece. We can see our small section clearly, but we lack the vantage point to understand how it fits into the complete picture.

## The Science of Limited Vision 🔬

Research in cognitive psychology reveals just how constrained our perception really is. The phenomenon called ""cognitive tunneling"" shows that under stress, our focus narrows dramatically. We become hyper-focused on immediate problems while losing sight of broader patterns and possibilities.

Similarly, the ""planning fallacy"" demonstrates our consistent inability to predict how long tasks will take or how events will unfold. We routinely underestimate complications and overestimate our control over outcomes.

These limitations aren't character flaws - they're built into the human experience. Our brains evolved to handle immediate, local challenges, not to comprehend vast, interconnected systems spanning years or decades.

## The Higher Operating System 🧭

Imagine for a moment that life operates according to a more sophisticated system than our individual planning and understanding can grasp. This isn't about supernatural intervention or religious doctrine - it's about recognizing that complex systems often have emergent properties that no single component can predict or control.

Consider how ant colonies create intricate structures and efficient foraging patterns without any individual ant understanding the master plan. Each ant follows simple rules, yet the collective result is remarkably sophisticated and adaptive.

Or think about how market economies coordinate the production and distribution of millions of products across the globe. No central planner designs this system, yet it responds dynamically to changing needs and conditions in ways that consistently outperform centralized planning attempts.

What if human life operates according to similar principles? What if there's an underlying coordination system that guides events toward optimal outcomes, even when individual participants can't see or understand the process?

## Practical Benefits of Trusting the Process ✨

Regardless of whether such a system actually exists, adopting this mindset offers tangible benefits:

### Reduced Anxiety and Stress
When we trust that there's wisdom in life's apparent randomness, we worry less about controlling every outcome. This reduces cortisol levels, improves decision-making, and enhances overall well-being.

### Increased Resilience
People who believe in a benevolent larger pattern bounce back faster from setbacks. They're more likely to view challenges as temporary redirections rather than permanent defeats.

### Better Decision-Making
Paradoxically, when we stop trying to control everything, we often make better choices. We become more open to unexpected opportunities and less likely to force solutions that aren't working.

### Enhanced Creativity
Trust in the process frees up mental energy for creative problem-solving. Instead of anxiously trying to predict and control outcomes, we can focus on responding skillfully to whatever emerges.

## Daily Applications: Living the Perfect Path 🛤️

Here's how to integrate this wisdom into everyday life:

### Morning Mindset Shift 🌅
Start each day with this simple affirmation: ""Today I will do my best work and trust that the results will serve the bigger picture."" This doesn't mean being passive - it means combining effort with acceptance.

### The Three-Question Filter
When facing difficult situations, ask yourself:
1. What can I directly control right now?
2. What am I trying to force that might work better if I allow it to unfold?
3. How might this challenge be preparing me for something I can't yet see?

### Reframing Setbacks 🔄
Instead of asking ""Why is this happening to me?"" try ""What is this experience teaching me?"" or ""How might this be redirecting me toward something better?""

### The GPS Approach to Life Navigation
Like following GPS directions, focus on the next step rather than trying to see the entire route. GPS recalculates when you take a wrong turn - similarly, life's guidance system can work with your mistakes and redirect you accordingly.

### Weekly Reflection Practice 📝
Every Sunday, spend 10 minutes reviewing the week. Look for patterns, unexpected connections, and moments when apparent problems led to positive outcomes. This builds confidence in life's underlying intelligence.

## When the Path Seems Impossible 🌪️

Sometimes life presents situations that feel genuinely impossible or unfair. During these times, consider these approaches:

**The Zoom-Out Technique**: Imagine viewing your current situation from increasingly distant perspectives - one year from now, ten years from now, from the perspective of your great-grandchildren. How might the significance of current problems change?

**The Skill-Building Frame**: Ask what capabilities this challenge is developing in you. Difficult situations often build exactly the skills we'll need for future opportunities we can't yet imagine.

**The Connection Catalyst**: Many of life's most valuable relationships and opportunities emerge from shared struggles. Your current difficulty might be positioning you to help others or connect with the right people later.

## The Compound Effect of Perfect Timing ⏰

One of the most remarkable aspects of trusting life's intelligence is witnessing perfect timing in retrospect. Skills learned in one context become crucial in another. People met casually years ago become essential connections. Experiences that seemed irrelevant at the time provide exactly the wisdom needed for future challenges.

This isn't coincidence - it's the compound effect of a system that's continuously preparing us for what's ahead, even when we can't see it coming.

## Building Unshakeable Trust 💪

Developing deep trust in life's process is like building physical strength - it requires consistent practice:

**Start Small**: Begin by trusting the process in low-stakes situations. Notice how things often work out better than you planned.

**Document Evidence**: Keep a journal of times when apparent setbacks led to positive outcomes. This creates a personal database of evidence for life's intelligence.

**Practice Surrender**: Regularly release your grip on specific outcomes. This doesn't mean stopping effort - it means holding your plans lightly.

**Cultivate Patience**: Remember that the perfect path often involves perfect timing, which rarely matches our preferred timeline.

## The Ripple Effect 🌊

As you begin trusting the larger intelligence at work in your life, you'll notice ripple effects:
- Decreased need to control others
- Increased appreciation for life's complexity
- Greater peace during uncertain times  
- Enhanced ability to spot opportunities
- Deeper connections with others who share this perspective

## The 400-Year Test 🕰️

Will this wisdom remain relevant centuries from now? Absolutely. As long as humans have limited perspective and life involves uncertainty, the principle of trusting a larger intelligence will remain valuable. Technology may advance, but the fundamental challenge of navigating complexity with incomplete information is timeless.

Future generations may have different words for it, but they'll still need ways to find peace amid uncertainty and to recognize that their individual understanding, however sophisticated, represents just one small piece of an incomprehensibly vast puzzle.

## Your Next Steps Forward 👣

Starting today, you can begin living with greater trust in life's perfect path:

1. **Notice your resistance**: When do you most struggle to trust the process?
2. **Experiment with letting go**: Pick one area where you're trying to force an outcome and practice releasing your grip
3. **Look for evidence**: Start collecting examples of times when things worked out better than you planned
4. **Share the perspective**: Discuss this approach with others and learn from their experiences

Remember: trusting the perfect path doesn't make you passive or naive. It makes you a skilled navigator who combines intelligent effort with wise acceptance, creating space for solutions and opportunities you never could have imagined on your own.

The path ahead is perfect - not because it's easy, but because it's precisely calibrated to help you become who you're meant to be and contribute what the world needs from you. Your job isn't to design the route; it's to walk it with courage, curiosity, and trust.

#**General Season Review**

First and foremost, a big thanks to /u/Callywood for getting this together for the second year. It's a massive undertaking behind the scenes, basically herding cats on steroids, but he makes it so easy. 

Second, I would be remiss if I didn't shout out my fellow writers. Without their donation of their time and energy none of this would be possible. 
  
It's the morning after the championship game as I sip my coffee and reflect on the first title of my football life and I am 37 almost 38. I think back to a week before the season started and I seriously didn't think we'd be anywhere near a ring. 
  
Even after week one, when we upset the Stallions, I was like I am entertained, we are the naughty Bad Boyz of the UFL. Maybe we win like 4 games and have fun, I'm down. This'll be way more entertaining than last year.”
   
Then the heavens opened up and a single ray of sunshine seemed down on us DC fans. A choir of angels began to sing. A single [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitedFootballLeague/comments/1jvf524/per_sources_gregg_williams_is_gone_as_the_dc_for/?share_id=ZT5WCjxtLS1_shs2NUZqn) popped up on my reddit feed and brought tears of joy to my eyes. The bad man is gone! I need not waste anymore time on explaining why his scheme was pure shit. “There's no reason to do that!”
 
He Who Mustn't Be EVER Named’s exit immediately raised the ceiling of the team from bottom dweller that might be entertaining to fringe playoff contender.
  
As I look back on the season, I have to put the season in two buckets: the regular season where we exactly met those expectations. We made the playoffs really because Luis Perez made two mistakes at the worst time, the second one being inexplicably stupid. We made the playoffs despite losing back to back and could've easily lost three. 

Then the playoffs happened. I’ve told players exactly this: once you get to the dance, it's a whole new season. Everyone is 0-0. What you did over the course of the season is meaningless. All that matters is this week, how you get after it, how you prepare. This playoff run was exactly why you say that.

The phrase “Any Given Sunday” means to me that ANY team that prepares the right way and embraces the right culture during the week has a puncher's chance in its game that week As I reflect on this ‘25 season that ended in a trophy, I can only explain it by saying “Any Given Sunday” feel is real, it's not just a cliche. 

We weren't the most talented. We weren't the best coached. But we got in the dance. Everyone goes back to 0-0, doesn't matter what you did, just what you do that day. Embraced an “Audi West” mindset and culture. Prepared hard. Then it's “Any Given Sunday” and they got two KOs, playing the two best games of the whole season.

#**‘24 Offseason**

##**Key Players Who Returned**

*Abram Smith, RB, Oct ‘24 - Once upon a time, Smith was the most dominant RB in Spring Football. Then he tore his ACL in camp and missed the entire ’24 UFL season. We live in a world where we are spoiled by our football players returning from an ACL all the time but it's a devastating injury and I knew Smith wasn't really ever going to be the same again. He was a good candidate to call it quits after that but returned to the Defenders in October to play for them in ‘25. Smith shared the carries, and only put up 2.82 YPC on 285 yards. But in the playoffs, he helped DC run over St. Louis with 64 yards and a TD. He got his much deserved ring. DC might add more RBs this off-season (*cough* Michael Wiley *cough*) and I expect to see him continue to be marginalized in the offense even if he returns in ‘26 but he's done a ton for DC as is.*

*Trey Scott, WR, Dec ‘24 - I had hoped that ½ between Harmon and Scott would return to the team for ‘25. Scott did, although he got hurt in Week 3 and missed the rest of the season. He returned and immediately reestablished himself as a difference maker by catching a 73 yard touchdown in the UFL Championship.*

*Jordan Ta’amu, QB, Jan ‘25 - After the 2024 season, I was whelmed by the news that Ta’amu would return in ‘25. I was adamant all off-season that the worst thing the Defenders could do was run it all back and with him returning, it was apparent that's what they were going to do. Ta’amu returned to his ’23 performance somewhat although the playmaking with his legs wasn't always utilized and his accuracy issues at times continued. He went on to play the game of his life in the championship, winning that game’s MVP..*

##**Key Players Who Went**
  
*Kelvin Harmon, WR - A former Washington draft pick that had a promising rookie year before tearing his ACL that next off-season, Harmon remerged in DC sports last season as a viable receiving option for the Defenders and was on his way to a nice year when he got hurt. This off-season, he chose to break the hearts of DC fans by signing with the Dallas Cowboys. Although he was cut, he stayed on their practice squad for the season and then instead of returning to the Defenders he signed a futures deal with Dallas.*
  
*Michael Joseph, DB - I have a huge soft spot for him. Once upon a time, I was about a year and a half into living in a strange apartment, in a state I had just come to visit as a kid to see my grandparents, after moving 13 hours away from the place I grew up, leaving my young son behind. I was 4 years removed from randomly getting sick on Tuesday that destroyed my ability to talk and my balance, forcing me to relearn how to “talk” and to finally use a wheelchair after breaking two fingers from stubbornly insisting I was fine. WFT (they weren't the Commanders yet) kept me mentally distracted enough to keep from going insane but the season was ending and I faced a long period without my mental distraction. I had heard about the XFL relaunching and how they'd feature a DC team so I checked out their first game of the year. Seattle was beating us, largely thanks to defensive play calling that disgusted me to the core. I was ready to turn it off and dabble on my computer but then the lemons started flying. Intrigued, I kept watching. What I saw was a fanbase totally taking over a sequence. Seattle was backed up deep in their own zone, which just so happens to have been by the beer snake section which was full of drunk, angry, disgruntled DC fans that were loudly cheering. First came a ref stoppage because lemons were flying onto the field. Then DC gets a sack which spins the already rapid beer snake section into a frenzy. Then it happens. Ben Dinucci, who I only knew as a hated Dallas Cowboy former draft pick, steps back to pass and throws right to the waiting arms of a DC Defender. That Defender then zig zags his way for an easy pick-6, capping it with a somersault into the endzone. The beer snake section went INSANE, throwing mists of beer into the sky. DC went on to win that game. Joseph got that pick-6 en route to an All-XFL year in 2023. He came back in 2024 to play for the Defenders again but didn't achieve the same heights and didn't return this past season. Football wise, his departure wasn't a big deal, the defense did fine without him. Emotionally though, I was saddened to see him leave. I shall never forget his play that turned me into a spring football sicko.* 

##**Notable Signees**
  
*Deon Jackson, RB, Dec ’24 - After spending the ‘24 season with the Jets but not registering a single carry, Jackson opted to take his services to DC, where he proved to be a major asset, leading the team in rushing.*
  
*Cornell Powell, WR, Mar ’24 - Just like Jackson, Powell was huge for DC. Coming to them from the Seattle practice squad (after winning two rings with the Chiefs previously), Powell became a major option for Ta’amu, especially after Scott went down. He led DC in receiving TDs with 7, with no one else getting even half that.* 

##**Notable Trades**
  
*On November 5th, the Defenders traded QB Jalan McClendon to the Roughnecks for CB Kiondre Thomas. AND On November 14th, the Brahmas traded CB Bryce Thompson to the Defenders for DE Jalen Harris.*

The only thing I would note here about these trades is the 1 player for 1 player trades at the moment in the UFL are often lopsided. Trading away a QB that eventually became the guy in Houston in exchange for a CB who didn't perform badly, 2 Starts and an Int, but wasn't a full-time starter just straight up, seems kinda silly. But early days for the league that's centrally owned so these sorts of trades happen.

* My initial reaction was “WTF, Why only people in NFL Camps?”
* After no one really signed with us, that initial reaction did not get better. 
* Shout-out to Michael Wiley though, he was great for Washington in pre-season, really a shame we didn't get to see him in UFL action as of yet.
* Skip Holtz emphasized a draft strategy that DC appears to have gone: in a rights draft, you retain the rights of the players you draft so everyone drafted here could sign with DC after their NFL career flames out.

#**Week by Week Detailed Season Review**

##**Regular Season**

###Week 1: Birmingham Stallions, 18-11

*Color me very surprised. I thought we'd get killed this game and it was surprisingly fun to watch. I especially enjoyed the newfound energy on the sidelines and our HC yelled at Skip after the game. We may go 4-6, but we will be the naughty Bad Boyz of the league.*

###Week 2: Memphis Showboats, 17-12

*This was an annoying watch. Much respect to the few Showboats fans around. Y'all the true heroes. But this game had no business not being decided by the 4th quarter. The Defenders just missed on some big plays that were there to be made and could've blown the game wide *

###Week 3: @St. Louis Battlehawks, 27-15

*Rejoice! The Bad Man plagues us no more! I'm on the record saying I was willing to look the other way this week in order to fully enjoy my first Defenders game without the Bad Man. They spoiled me. Not only did we finally have intelligent defensive play calling throughout (two high safeties on third and long!!!!) but we actually won and solidified ourselves atop the XFL conference.*

###Week 4: San Antonio Brahmas, 18-24

*1st-Goal on the 6. Punch it in and you win. I was in and out watching this but what a letdown. Beat the rival in the XFL conference the week before in their building, just to lose to the basement dweller at home the next week because you couldn't score at the end. A lesser fan would get mad but I watched the game where we put the 1 in 9-1 years back so I was more emotionally stable.*

###Week 5: @Arlington Renegades, 37-33

*Many years from now, my grandchildren will sit by my feet and ask me “Papa why did you hate He Who Mustn't EVER Be Named so much?”. Well you sweet summer children, watch the end of the Houston game in ‘24. See how the announcer goes “There's no reason to do that!” at the end? That's why. Every game, every high level situation, he called a scheme that made absolutely zero sense to even the half educated eye. Now children you go watch the first ‘25 Arlington game final Arlington drive for a simple contrast. Two high safeties. Make them drive the length of the field without making a mistake. And boom Perez did (although I'd have appreciated a replay.)*

###Week 6: @Michigan Panthers, 14-38

*Well that was a massacre. An expected one, but one nevertheless. I don't remember much, I watched the whole thing but was writing and held paying attention after the massacre started. When we faced them in the championship, absolutely nothing I saw in this game indicated to me THAT was possible.*

###Week 7: @San Antonio, 32-24

*I hate the Alamodome subconsciously. Bad memories there. The challenge gods are sometimes harsh. Was a closer contest than the records would have had you thinking going in.* 

###Week 8: Arlington, 33-30

*Ah yes the ESPN game that forever established my hate for basketball. Was a very fun, back and forth game. The kind of game the league could be proud of. When Joe tells us “we are going off ABC to ESPN 2” I was like “well duh that makes sense because NBA>>>>>>UFL, well it's a good thing I am on ESPN+ and thus wo-”. A mortal enemy of the NBA was born that day. I shall never forget.*

###Week 9: @Houston, 21-24

*There is a glaring blemish on the record of the’25 Defenders. It's the end score of this game. The rare pick-6 on a XP happened which was hilarious but that's the only other thing I took away.*

###Week 10: St. Louis, 8-13

*Meh. I was a sicko, fully excited about seeing what we had in our backup QB. Even had the game up on my big screen. Then the rain delayed the game and I moved it to my computer as I did other stuff. I watched the game but couldn't really conclude much from it.*

##**Playoffs**

###XFL Conference Championship: St. Louis, 36-18

*The”Audi West” game. Although I needed yet more, which we got the following week, this quote will go down in team lore. Although I now live in Wisconsin, I still talk with my best friend since I was 4. We watched this game together while hanging out in Discord and were not expecting the beat down it was. The game plan heavily featured the run, starting a two game stretch where the Defenders played on another level. By five minutes left in the game, we were barely watching and I was convinced our season wasn't going to be better than this. I was very very very wrong.* 

###UFL Championship: @Michigan Panthers, 58-34

*This season ended for me the same way it began: utter shock and awe. Full disclosure: I turned down a chance to see this live. My son had just gotten into town, he was against going because he wanted to play and have a chill day. I wasn't thrilled about driving five hours and was miserable with double impacted ear drums. So although my mom was very gung ho about doing a weekend trek down to Audi West, I passed. They were playing the team that massacred them. It'll be over early in the 3rd, my son is going to get bored and demand we leave. I'm in a wheelchair, so going anywhere is a fun little production. I just didn't have the energy for that AND double impacted ear drums aren't fun. So I opted to watch live on ESPN+ while my son read Animorphs on the couch, occasionally looking up at the score. It was over by the 3rd but not the way I predicted. WOW. That's my only analysis of the game itself other than I love 4-12. Added suspense there for a bit.*

-----  

#**High Points**

* Obviously, the last game of the year. The football gods finally granted their blessings. It came against a team I would have fully honored to put over inorder to grant another fanbase, one that has also seen some troubling times, a trophy. I'm fully prepared to do the job in return, see y'all in a few months Detroit. It happened in Audi West, so that's definitely a thing now. 
 
* The St. Louis playoff game. I thought this was going to be the High Point because surely we weren't winning that final game. Oopsie.

* Beating the Stallions in Week 1. I had spent the whole off-season dogging DC. Coming off the Commander's rebirth season, the fanbase was going to need a breather and enthusiasm around the team was at a low point. Not only did we get a upset W, but our HC yelled at Skip after the game. We may go like 4-6 again, I thought, but I am going to have so much fun watching the naughty bad boys. 

-----  

#**Low Points**

* Losing to Houston. I talked a massive amount of shit about CJ. The fact we actually lost to him, despite whoever played, is a massive stain on my integrity.

* The 38-14 Michigan massacre in the regular season. I wasn't expecting anything but damn that got way awful to watch and I was half paying attention, half doing other things.

* The Memphis Showboats game. Huh? Y'all won! Yes, but that's the kind of game I would walk into the team room Monday pissed as hell. Jordan missing guys, defense giving up plays at the worst time. It was nasty. Y'all saw what can happen when Jordan has a great day in the title game. This game is what happens when he's off.

|Interceptions Thrown|4|.4|1st|7th|
|Fumbles Lost|7|.7|T3rd| 1st|

*The offense improved or stayed the same in almost every category.
*The improvement in giveaways has to be mentioned when looking for reasons why this 2025 Defenders team was successful. 
*The deep passing game was deadly when it hit and they put on a clinic in the title game.
*The run game stayed about the same if you just study the stats but I got the impression it was far more impactful in the game flow this year, as it felt opposing defenses needed to respect it more 
*Building on that last point, we saw the Defenders run over the Battlehawks in the playoffs so it felt like if they had featured it more in the game plan, better overall numbers could have been had.

##**PFF Oline Grades**

|**Player Name**|**Position**|**Snaps**|**Overall Grade**|**Run Blocking Grade**|**Pass Blocking Grade**|**Sacks Allowed**|

* Continuity was night and day different from ‘24, as the Defenders enjoyed a season with a stable front 5. 
* 5 guys played over 430 snaps.
* Yasir Durant made All-UFL and was one of the best lineman in the league.
* Adding depth and keeping this unit strong needs to be a priority.

##**Team Defense**

|Interceptions|7|.7|T2nd|T6th|
|Fumbles Recovered|9|.9|T2nd|T4th|

*The Bad Man is forever gone!
*The stats themselves are similar to last years, the defense against the pass got slightly worse while the run defense improved.
* The points allowed ranking is exactly the same as last year.
* The biggest difference in the W/L column is that they forced more turnovers, with both interceptions and fumbles recovered increasing.
* They also saw a jump in sacks that helped force opponents into more obvious passing downs which in turn helped in forcing more turnovers.

##**Some Individual Statistics**

###*Ta’amu*

|**Player**|**Number of Attempts**|**Completion %**|**Passing Yards**|Y/A|**Passing Yards/Game**|*TD/ Int*|**Times Sacked**|**Rating**|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|’25 Ta’amu|285|54.4|2,153|7.6|215.3|17/4 |7|92.9| 
|’24 Ta’amu|280|57.5|1,854|6.6|113.4|15/9|19|82.1|
|Up/Down|Up|Down|Up|Up|Up|Up|Up|Up|

* A year removed from me stating I would be fine with some competition for Ta’amu, he returned to his XFL numbers, improving in almost every category.
* The one category that went down? Completion %.
* The broadcasts were quick to explain away the dip in % by saying it's only because DC threw deep more.
* Ta’amu did improve his YPA by a whole yard but I would point to the Memphis game as caution against attributing his drop in completion % solely to “they threw deep more”. 
* He's who he is and is going to have bad accuracy days.
* After playing the game of his life in this year's UFL championship game, the QB job in DC is firmly his for the future.

###*Rushing ’25 vs ‘24*

|**Player**|**Rushing Attempts**|**Rushing Yards**|**Rushing Average**|**Rushing Touchdowns**|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|‘25 D. Jackson|83|417|5.02|4|
|‘25 A. Smith|101|285|2.82|1|
|‘24 C. Harris |83|253|3.05|4|


* Deon Jackson stepped up huge for DC, and allowed Smith to get his mojo back slowly.
*Jackson’s YPC was excellent and the running game wasn’t the primary focus of the offense but largely effective when called upon.
*Adding another RB this offseason as insurance is paramount.

###*Receiving ‘’25 vs ‘24*

* After last season where the targets were primarily focused on three options, Ta’amu returned to his XFL form by spreading the ball around.
* Ty Scott was on pace for a great year but got hurt Week 3.
* Chris Rowland and Cornell Powell stepped up huge when Scott went down, allowing the Defenders offense to hardly miss a beat. 

----  

#**Roster Review**

##**All-UFL**

*Chris Rowland (WR), Yasir Durant (LT), Joe Wallace (DT), Derick Roberson (EDGE), Anthony Hines (LB), Deandre Baker (CB)*

##**Strength**

*The deep passing game became a key strength of this team. Jordan’s YPA went up as a result and they were first in the league in Pass Yard/Game.*

*Deon Jackson and Abram Smith rotated nicely and Jackson averaged 5.02 ypc. Going into the season, finding someone to help carry the load while Smith continued to recover from an ACL was paramount and the Defenders got it in Jackson.*

*After Ty Scott went down, the passing game didn’t miss a beat. Rowland and Powell kept Jordan largely satisfied.*

*DC’s O-Line play was clearly stronger in 2025 than it was in 2024, thanks largely in part to more stability.*

##Weakness 

*”Completion % Allowed” would be the first metric I’d point to as a problematic trend that needs to be fixed.*

*Creativity in the RedZone was something I found to be really lacking at points, especially early in the season.*

*We are still 6th in points and yards allowed. The bliss of ridding ourselves of the bad man allowed me to give them a pass temporarily but that time is up*

-----  

#**Coaching Staff Review**

*Shannon Harris, HC:*

Before the playoff run, I was ready to ship his ass off. I liked the renewed energy on the sideline. I liked his chip for being called a doorman. I didn't like that week in and week out, he refused to make basic gamesmanship decisions. The other team intentionally causes a delay of game to give them 5 more yards of space to try to pin you deep? Well duh, you decline that. NOPE! When I saw him do that, I unleashed on my TV. That’s gamesmanship I did all the time coaching HIGH SCHOOL. How is this hard? I was calling him “The Amateur” and was fully ready to go 0-1 in the playoffs and get this cleanout started. Then we ran over the Battlehawks and at the award ceremony he called the Dome “Audi West.” Ok, fine, cute. Get demolished in the championship, and you can ride off into the sunset. He won. OK, well you’re probably coming back but at least spend the offseason taking Gamesmanship 101. Then it was leaked he was joining Reggie in Tennessee and frankly I was writing him off again. Supposedly he’s going to try doubling as the HC again regardless? I am extremely skeptical you can handle two positions at once, especially at this level.

*Gregg Williams/ Blake Williams, DC:*

The bad man is gone! After The Bad Man pissed off to Tennessee, I gave Blake a hall pass for the rest of the season so I could bask in the bliss of two deep in no brainer spots. I would assume he returns for ‘26 and that’s when I am going to critique him normally. Points and yards allowed need to improve.

*Fred Kaiss, OC:*

This year’s Assistant of the Year really rebounded from the 2024 levels. The offense didn’t exactly return to the 2023 XFL form, where it got to the point where as a fan I just was confident we’d score whenever we touched the ball, and the Red Zone struggled a bit in my opinion, especially early. But, he found a better hurry up flow and quickly leaned on a deep passing game. In the playoffs, he put on two masterclasses. After running over the Battlehawks, he reverted to a deep passing game for the championship which was executed brilliantly and caught the Panthers off guard. There’s still room for improvement, I’d like to see a return to using the QB as a threat to use his legs. But Kaiss is returning to the team in ‘26 and I look forward to the next evolution of this offense, which was more than I could say last year.

#**2025 Offseason**

##**2025 Draft** 

Doing the draft BEFORE NFL training camps made little sense and I am happy to see that was one of the first off-season adjustments that the league made. Now tentatively slated for September 2nd, which is after this gets released, DC will be assuming its rightful spot at the end of the draft order this year. BPA, keep the lines well stocked with talent on both sides of the ball, and how about we actually sign 1-2 players we draft to our actual roster this year?

*Editor’s Note: It has been reported the UFL College Draft is being further delayed to September 23rd.*

##**Team Needs**

O-line depth is at the top of my list. Our starting LT and G are currently in NFL camps and they were among your best. DC enjoyed a year of stability all along the line after a tumultuous year in ‘24. Keeping this group roughly together this off-season while adding quality depth should be the top priority. I’d also keep the RB and DL depth up. 

Finally, I’m more invested this year in getting our core to return to the team. With the added twist of a UFL free agency, Von Hutchins is going to need to really step it up. Coming from the spoiled position I’m in with Adam Peters on the other team, Von’s background remains unimpressive. He’s going to have many key decisions about the direction of the team moving forward.

----

#**Outlook**

Like the rest of the UFL atm, the final outlook for this team is murky. Whose returning? Can Shannon Harris really do a double shift this year? Can DC return the majority of its guys? 
 
That last one is a big one. Team building year to year in the UFL is much more fluid than in the NFL atm and the only constants really are your Coaching Staff.  Since I was skeptical of Harris and his decision to try dual positions, I have no firm confidence that the ‘26 Defenders will achieve the same heights it did with the two best playoff games of my football fandom in ‘25. 

One of DC’s weak points this year was the inconsistent play of their defensive unit. This is something that will have to be addressed in the offseason regardless of who returns.  It was a thrilling season for the DC Defenders with a great culture, but ‘26 won’t care what the team did in ‘25. I am tentatively putting them at 6-4 again with the WC birth but I will be anxiously watching the roster developments.

-----  

#**The DC Market**

[In last year's 8 in 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitedFootballLeague/comments/1etogrn/8_teams8_days_day_4_the_dc_defenders/), I took a very pessimistic view of the state of the DC market in respect to the hype for the Defenders specifically. A year removed and the football gods have blessed me both with Jaysus and a UFL championship in a year I didn't think we'd make the playoffs. My football fandom suffered it’s formative years under Dan Snyder, so great start football gods but keep going til I tell you to stop.

Thus, I am going to be happier this year. First, I want to point out though: I was right. DC attendance was down this year from the year before, which was also slightly down from XFL levels. The Non-St. Louis' attendance title was very much up for grabs. The rest of the markets dropped the ball. Michigan, you have graduated to the big kids table. Too bad your stadium is being a jerk. The rest of you get it together. 

This upcoming year won’t be as easy. After the party we threw for the Defenders down at the wharf and what was a well covered facetime with the mayor, DC’s local popularity has grown. I expect a slight uptick in attendance, not to XFL levels but a return to its ‘24 UFL numbers.

-----  

#**Final Remarks**
Thank you for reading! I know it's a big wall of text so if you stuck around this far, you are special to me.

Thanks again to /u/Callywood for organizing this series, it's a great way to do a deep AAR on the ‘25 season. Thank you for allowing me to be a part of it again obviously, but also for stat diving and editing. 

I can almost guarantee there are mistakes and will do edits to correct.

1n39ajh,https://i.redd.it/0ufcx4jf0zlf1.jpeg,"Robots are cool, a DD","Richtech Robotics A Due Diligence

Currently trading at 3-3.2$ a share and I am convinced it will be trading above 100$ within a five to ten year time horizon.

Fundamentals and Overview Richtech defines their company mission as, “By harnessing the power of collaborative robotic solutions, Richtech is redefining the service industry landscape. Our mission is to drive a revolutionary automation of tasks, enhancing customer experiences, and enabling businesses to unlock their full potential.”

“Richtech Robotics partners with NVIDIA through the NVIDIA Connect program to integrate NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing technologies, such as the Jetson Orin platform and Isaac Sim, into their service robots like Adam and Scorpion. This collaboration enhances Richtech's robots with improved body movement detection accuracy, faster development times through simulation, and more efficient navigation in complex environments. The partnership aims to accelerate Richtech's mission to make AI-driven service robots a common sight in industries such as hospitality, retail, and restaurants.” As we have seen over the last five to ten years, NVIDIA has become the industry leader in the AI and semiconductor market. With a market cap of over 4.4 trillion dollars, NVIDIA is positioned as the backbone of the technological landscape for the foreseeable future. Because of this, NVIDIA will be able to consistently supply Richtech with the most up to date technology for their line of robotics. Additionally, NVIDIA has a 50% voting share of the company so will be able to guide them financially as they make their transition from unprofitable to profitable.

Market Opportunity A majority of my positive sentiment comes from the FACT that low-skill jobs will be phased out of existence within a 10-20 year time horizon. I believe trade skills (electricians, mechanics, etc.) will be one of the few blue collar job markets that will survive the coming AI and tech revolution. However, back to low-skill jobs, I fully believe jobs like assembly line workers, fast food workers, cashiers, hostesses and waiters, taxi and uber drivers, and many more will become obsolete as robotics transition into becoming a cheaper labor option. Yes, I know a majority of robotics companies are in the very early trial phase, and many of the existing prototypes have not become fully functional. While that may be a bearish sign for the robotics market now, I believe it only provides RR with less barriers to entry in the coming years. As I said before, Richtech is financially backed by NVIDIA and operates on their platforms. This allows RR to put more focus into the development of their robotics as they have a 4.4 trillion dollar market giant lining their pockets.

Enough about NVIDIA, let’s continue to discuss RR’s market opportunity in the future. As consumer and commercial robotics transition into the global labor market, companies like Richtech have the opportunity to become the face of an entirely new industry. I really love this stock, and believe robotics poses a similar market opportunity to Apple in 2008. As we have seen with every form of new technology that comes out, initial reactions are typically all over the place, often siding towards skepticism.

Historical Examples Steve Ballmer (former CEO of Microsoft) said this, “There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.” Yeah okay bud, how did that turn out for you.

Or similarly, look at the public reaction to the current AI revolution (screenshot at top). This is not to say that there is always a bad reaction as new technology is released, just that the public often sides towards skepticism vs optimism. Robotics is currently the center of one of these optimism vs. skepticism debates in regards to its long term potential. This is why I believe now is the best buying opportunity for robotics and robotics stocks. This is a situation where we have the chance to buy that metaphorical iPhone at its release (i.e robotics). Don’t be a Steve Balmer, look beyond the next few years!

Technology and Software Richtech Robotics currently has seven operational robot models with a variety of functions.

Competitors/Current Market Landscape

Richtech Robotics is taking aim at the low skill job industry I spoke about earlier with their service industry robotics. Industry analysts point to a market with few pure-play automation names to lean on. Serve Robotics is one comparable, though it focuses more on autonomous delivery, while titans like ABB, Siemens, and Rockwell Automation dominate factory-floor automation Meanwhile, established robotics firms such as Intuitive Surgical shine in medical automation. At its core, Richtech’s competitive edge lies in its niche deployment in hospitality, health, and cleaning. I believe that these three industries could be some of the most affected by the upcoming robotic revolution. The company has already deployed over 300 robots across the U.S., blending proof-points with scale. RR is positioned to become the Apple, Google, Tesla of the robotics industry by 2030.

Future Potential

I fully believe to my core that Richtech stands on the brink of something big, even though the path might be a longer journey. The global retail automation market is projected to reach $25 billion by 2030, highlighting the magnitude of opportunity ahead. They recently signed two-year Master Services Agreement (with auto-renewal) with a major retailer signals a breakthrough in actual channel penetration and investor sentiment. For example, the stock soared 23% on that news alone. Add to that the Walmart ghost-kitchen deployments running Richtech robots in dozens of locations and the revenue potential becomes very tangible. These locations are each projected to pull in between $700,000 and $2 million annually. Pair this with Richtech’s 76% gross margin and strong solvency score (81/100), and you’ve got a company that isn’t just spending its cash left and right, it has a robust financial base to reinvest aggressively.

On the flip side, risks are real: analysts widely forecast price targets in the $2.50–$3.50 range, with an average near current levels. This implies modest to minimal short term upside. Freedom Broker recently downgraded RR to Sell, citing overvaluation and the need for more deliverables from its retailer partners before they’ll reconsider.

This poses a good buying opportunity for us. Many may still be thinking like Steve Balmer regarding the iPhone. Public perception still thinks robotics may be a fad or may never be able to “capture the market share.” All that aside, robotics has been framed as ""the next era"" by Nvidia’s CEO himself. So, Richtech is very much in the spotlight. Not only that, but its use of Nvidia’s scalable AI platform is an edge no current robotics competitor can replicate.

TL;DR

If you just want to read a paragraph, here you go:

Richtech Robotics (RR), trading at ~$3 today, backed by Nvidia, has seven operating service industry robots. Robotics has infinite market opportunities in retail, hospitality, and healthcare. I believe this is undeniably reminiscent of early-stage Apple circa 2008. Current verdict: strong margin profile, robust cash and solvency, tangible large-scale deployments en route. I believe that proof of consistent revenue execution is the crucial next step towards a robotics revolution. If you’re in for being a long-term investor, I have unwavering faith that RR could be the next Apple-like stock within the next 10-15 years.",2,1756478516.0,smallstreetbets,0,1.0,False
1n39a63,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1n39a63/how_to_help_a_friend_who_lost_his_bestfriend_to/,How to help a friend who lost his bestfriend to suicide ?,"Hello everyone. A few days ago, my partner's best friend (whom I befriended after my partner and I started dating) lost his female best friend (since middle school) to suicide. I think he only told my partner, and he is staying with his parents for the rest of the week. The funeral was yesterday and I think he went with his parents. 

My partner and I live together so he told me about it right after he got the news, we were both in shock but, before knowing that he left to go back to his parents, I told my partner to tell his best friend that he could come over anytime if he doesn't want to be alone, and that I could even try to go somewhere else for a night or two if he doesn't want me to be around as he might not be as comfortable.  

Now, we know that he also went to see a therapist today, and since we are visiting my partner's parents this weekend (not too far from the best friend's), we asked him if he wanted to grab a coffee and hangout tomorrow and he accepted. I am a bit anxious because I really really want to be there for him, because even if I met him through my partner, I consider him to be one of my dear friends too. I didn't really know the girl, we played minecraft together once (all 4 of us) but my partner and I know nothing else about her other than what he told us. It has been such a weird week because even if I don't have any real connection with her, I couldn't stop thinking about it, and worrying about his well being (he doesn't have that many close friends, and he doesn't really go out either, so I can't even imagine how traumatic it can't be to lose her). 

If you have ever experienced something similar, how do you think I/my partner and I can help him ? I don't know how much I can ""do"", as he didn't reach out to me about it at all, only my partner, and I don't want to be intrusive or make him uncomfortable tomorrow. Also I sensed that even my partner has a hard time knowing how to act or what to say, as he experienced grief for the first time earlier this year and navigating such heavy emotions is still very new to him. 

Thank you in advance to anyone who replies, and to anyone reading this and going through hard times, I am sending you big hugs <3 ",2,1756478492.0,GriefSupport,1,1.0,False

You're sure you have everything, but you just feel... Empty. What is it? Are you lacking a football, placed conveniently in the ""Parent doesn't want kid to cause a scene, so fuck it, just get it to shit him up"" section of the store? Is it a set of colouring pencils? Is it a fucking massive calculator that belongs to a giant in the 90s, emblazoned, ever so offensively with the sports direct logo?

And then.... It hits you. Behind the staff at the checkout.  Time stands still. Everyone around you fades out of irrelevance. It starts glowing. ""Hello"", it sings, ""Is it me you're looking for?""

My friend, you have just seen it. The chalice of champions. The cup of conquerors. The mug of monarchs. My friend, your eyes have been blessed with a mug that defies your expectations. It's so far away, but it looks like it's closer. Your mind boggles; it's next to items that seem disproportionately smaller, or it is disproportionately larger. It's confusing, what is this? And why is it out in the wild?

That, my friend, is a Sports direct mug.

Do we know how much it holds? Who knows. Is it healthy to expect to drink that much of any beverage? Almost certainly not. However, you don't care. You occupy the right percentage of the earth, you want to stand out among those pint 250ml drinkers. You have too much taste to buy a Humvee, but you want it's mug equivalent. You *want *to take up the space in the cupboard. You want to restrict the places your mug can go. You want people to be impressed by how much coffee you are drinking. You want everyone's eyes to be drawn to you in the 10am meeting. You want the Sports direct mug.

And if you think you have the willpower to refrain from buying one, my dear friend, you're about as naive as a flipped evian. You may be able to show restraint, but it'll find you. In the office. At a neighbour's house. In the garage. It knows where you live, and it wants to know why you didn't take it home.

You don't just drink in a sports direct mug. You invite your tongue to swim in a sports direct mug.

#**General Season Review**

First and foremost, a big thanks to /u/Callywood for getting this together for the second year. It's a massive undertaking behind the scenes, basically herding cats on steroids, but he makes it so easy. 

Second, I would be remiss if I didn't shout out my fellow writers. Without their donation of their time and energy none of this would be possible. 
  
It's the morning after the championship game as I sip my coffee and reflect on the first title of my football life and I am 37 almost 38. I think back to a week before the season started and I seriously didn't think we'd be anywhere near a ring. 
  
Even after week one, when we upset the Stallions, I was like I am entertained, we are the naughty Bad Boyz of the UFL. Maybe we win like 4 games and have fun, I'm down. This'll be way more entertaining than last year.”
   
Then the heavens opened up and a single ray of sunshine seemed down on us DC fans. A choir of angels began to sing. A single [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitedFootballLeague/comments/1jvf524/per_sources_gregg_williams_is_gone_as_the_dc_for/?share_id=ZT5WCjxtLS1_shs2NUZqn) popped up on my reddit feed and brought tears of joy to my eyes. The bad man is gone! I need not waste anymore time on explaining why his scheme was pure shit. “There's no reason to do that!”
 
He Who Mustn't Be EVER Named’s exit immediately raised the ceiling of the team from bottom dweller that might be entertaining to fringe playoff contender.
  
As I look back on the season, I have to put the season in two buckets: the regular season where we exactly met those expectations. We made the playoffs really because Luis Perez made two mistakes at the worst time, the second one being inexplicably stupid. We made the playoffs despite losing back to back and could've easily lost three. 

Then the playoffs happened. I’ve told players exactly this: once you get to the dance, it's a whole new season. Everyone is 0-0. What you did over the course of the season is meaningless. All that matters is this week, how you get after it, how you prepare. This playoff run was exactly why you say that.

The phrase “Any Given Sunday” means to me that ANY team that prepares the right way and embraces the right culture during the week has a puncher's chance in its game that week As I reflect on this ‘25 season that ended in a trophy, I can only explain it by saying “Any Given Sunday” feel is real, it's not just a cliche. 

We weren't the most talented. We weren't the best coached. But we got in the dance. Everyone goes back to 0-0, doesn't matter what you did, just what you do that day. Embraced an “Audi West” mindset and culture. Prepared hard. Then it's “Any Given Sunday” and they got two KOs, playing the two best games of the whole season.

#**‘24 Offseason**

##**Key Players Who Returned**

*Abram Smith, RB, Oct ‘24 - Once upon a time, Smith was the most dominant RB in Spring Football. Then he tore his ACL in camp and missed the entire ’24 UFL season. We live in a world where we are spoiled by our football players returning from an ACL all the time but it's a devastating injury and I knew Smith wasn't really ever going to be the same again. He was a good candidate to call it quits after that but returned to the Defenders in October to play for them in ‘25. Smith shared the carries, and only put up 2.82 YPC on 285 yards. But in the playoffs, he helped DC run over St. Louis with 64 yards and a TD. He got his much deserved ring. DC might add more RBs this off-season (*cough* Michael Wiley *cough*) and I expect to see him continue to be marginalized in the offense even if he returns in ‘26 but he's done a ton for DC as is.*

*Trey Scott, WR, Dec ‘24 - I had hoped that ½ between Harmon and Scott would return to the team for ‘25. Scott did, although he got hurt in Week 3 and missed the rest of the season. He returned and immediately reestablished himself as a difference maker by catching a 73 yard touchdown in the UFL Championship.*

*Jordan Ta’amu, QB, Jan ‘25 - After the 2024 season, I was whelmed by the news that Ta’amu would return in ‘25. I was adamant all off-season that the worst thing the Defenders could do was run it all back and with him returning, it was apparent that's what they were going to do. Ta’amu returned to his ’23 performance somewhat although the playmaking with his legs wasn't always utilized and his accuracy issues at times continued. He went on to play the game of his life in the championship, winning that game’s MVP..*

##**Key Players Who Went**
  
*Kelvin Harmon, WR - A former Washington draft pick that had a promising rookie year before tearing his ACL that next off-season, Harmon remerged in DC sports last season as a viable receiving option for the Defenders and was on his way to a nice year when he got hurt. This off-season, he chose to break the hearts of DC fans by signing with the Dallas Cowboys. Although he was cut, he stayed on their practice squad for the season and then instead of returning to the Defenders he signed a futures deal with Dallas.*
  
*Michael Joseph, DB - I have a huge soft spot for him. Once upon a time, I was about a year and a half into living in a strange apartment, in a state I had just come to visit as a kid to see my grandparents, after moving 13 hours away from the place I grew up, leaving my young son behind. I was 4 years removed from randomly getting sick on Tuesday that destroyed my ability to talk and my balance, forcing me to relearn how to “talk” and to finally use a wheelchair after breaking two fingers from stubbornly insisting I was fine. WFT (they weren't the Commanders yet) kept me mentally distracted enough to keep from going insane but the season was ending and I faced a long period without my mental distraction. I had heard about the XFL relaunching and how they'd feature a DC team so I checked out their first game of the year. Seattle was beating us, largely thanks to defensive play calling that disgusted me to the core. I was ready to turn it off and dabble on my computer but then the lemons started flying. Intrigued, I kept watching. What I saw was a fanbase totally taking over a sequence. Seattle was backed up deep in their own zone, which just so happens to have been by the beer snake section which was full of drunk, angry, disgruntled DC fans that were loudly cheering. First came a ref stoppage because lemons were flying onto the field. Then DC gets a sack which spins the already rapid beer snake section into a frenzy. Then it happens. Ben Dinucci, who I only knew as a hated Dallas Cowboy former draft pick, steps back to pass and throws right to the waiting arms of a DC Defender. That Defender then zig zags his way for an easy pick-6, capping it with a somersault into the endzone. The beer snake section went INSANE, throwing mists of beer into the sky. DC went on to win that game. Joseph got that pick-6 en route to an All-XFL year in 2023. He came back in 2024 to play for the Defenders again but didn't achieve the same heights and didn't return this past season. Football wise, his departure wasn't a big deal, the defense did fine without him. Emotionally though, I was saddened to see him leave. I shall never forget his play that turned me into a spring football sicko.* 

##**Notable Signees**
  
*Deon Jackson, RB, Dec ’24 - After spending the ‘24 season with the Jets but not registering a single carry, Jackson opted to take his services to DC, where he proved to be a major asset, leading the team in rushing.*
  
*Cornell Powell, WR, Mar ’24 - Just like Jackson, Powell was huge for DC. Coming to them from the Seattle practice squad (after winning two rings with the Chiefs previously), Powell became a major option for Ta’amu, especially after Scott went down. He led DC in receiving TDs with 7, with no one else getting even half that.* 

##**Notable Trades**
  
*On November 5th, the Defenders traded QB Jalan McClendon to the Roughnecks for CB Kiondre Thomas. AND On November 14th, the Brahmas traded CB Bryce Thompson to the Defenders for DE Jalen Harris.*

The only thing I would note here about these trades is the 1 player for 1 player trades at the moment in the UFL are often lopsided. Trading away a QB that eventually became the guy in Houston in exchange for a CB who didn't perform badly, 2 Starts and an Int, but wasn't a full-time starter just straight up, seems kinda silly. But early days for the league that's centrally owned so these sorts of trades happen.

* My initial reaction was “WTF, Why only people in NFL Camps?”
* After no one really signed with us, that initial reaction did not get better. 
* Shout-out to Michael Wiley though, he was great for Washington in pre-season, really a shame we didn't get to see him in UFL action as of yet.
* Skip Holtz emphasized a draft strategy that DC appears to have gone: in a rights draft, you retain the rights of the players you draft so everyone drafted here could sign with DC after their NFL career flames out.

#**Week by Week Detailed Season Review**

##**Regular Season**

###Week 1: Birmingham Stallions, 18-11

*Color me very surprised. I thought we'd get killed this game and it was surprisingly fun to watch. I especially enjoyed the newfound energy on the sidelines and our HC yelled at Skip after the game. We may go 4-6, but we will be the naughty Bad Boyz of the league.*

###Week 2: Memphis Showboats, 17-12

*This was an annoying watch. Much respect to the few Showboats fans around. Y'all the true heroes. But this game had no business not being decided by the 4th quarter. The Defenders just missed on some big plays that were there to be made and could've blown the game wide *

###Week 3: @St. Louis Battlehawks, 27-15

*Rejoice! The Bad Man plagues us no more! I'm on the record saying I was willing to look the other way this week in order to fully enjoy my first Defenders game without the Bad Man. They spoiled me. Not only did we finally have intelligent defensive play calling throughout (two high safeties on third and long!!!!) but we actually won and solidified ourselves atop the XFL conference.*

###Week 4: San Antonio Brahmas, 18-24

*1st-Goal on the 6. Punch it in and you win. I was in and out watching this but what a letdown. Beat the rival in the XFL conference the week before in their building, just to lose to the basement dweller at home the next week because you couldn't score at the end. A lesser fan would get mad but I watched the game where we put the 1 in 9-1 years back so I was more emotionally stable.*

###Week 5: @Arlington Renegades, 37-33

*Many years from now, my grandchildren will sit by my feet and ask me “Papa why did you hate He Who Mustn't EVER Be Named so much?”. Well you sweet summer children, watch the end of the Houston game in ‘24. See how the announcer goes “There's no reason to do that!” at the end? That's why. Every game, every high level situation, he called a scheme that made absolutely zero sense to even the half educated eye. Now children you go watch the first ‘25 Arlington game final Arlington drive for a simple contrast. Two high safeties. Make them drive the length of the field without making a mistake. And boom Perez did (although I'd have appreciated a replay.)*

###Week 6: @Michigan Panthers, 14-38

*Well that was a massacre. An expected one, but one nevertheless. I don't remember much, I watched the whole thing but was writing and held paying attention after the massacre started. When we faced them in the championship, absolutely nothing I saw in this game indicated to me THAT was possible.*

###Week 7: @San Antonio, 32-24

*I hate the Alamodome subconsciously. Bad memories there. The challenge gods are sometimes harsh. Was a closer contest than the records would have had you thinking going in.* 

###Week 8: Arlington, 33-30

*Ah yes the ESPN game that forever established my hate for basketball. Was a very fun, back and forth game. The kind of game the league could be proud of. When Joe tells us “we are going off ABC to ESPN 2” I was like “well duh that makes sense because NBA>>>>>>UFL, well it's a good thing I am on ESPN+ and thus wo-”. A mortal enemy of the NBA was born that day. I shall never forget.*

###Week 9: @Houston, 21-24

*There is a glaring blemish on the record of the’25 Defenders. It's the end score of this game. The rare pick-6 on a XP happened which was hilarious but that's the only other thing I took away.*

###Week 10: St. Louis, 8-13

*Meh. I was a sicko, fully excited about seeing what we had in our backup QB. Even had the game up on my big screen. Then the rain delayed the game and I moved it to my computer as I did other stuff. I watched the game but couldn't really conclude much from it.*

##**Playoffs**

###XFL Conference Championship: St. Louis, 36-18

*The”Audi West” game. Although I needed yet more, which we got the following week, this quote will go down in team lore. Although I now live in Wisconsin, I still talk with my best friend since I was 4. We watched this game together while hanging out in Discord and were not expecting the beat down it was. The game plan heavily featured the run, starting a two game stretch where the Defenders played on another level. By five minutes left in the game, we were barely watching and I was convinced our season wasn't going to be better than this. I was very very very wrong.* 

###UFL Championship: @Michigan Panthers, 58-34

*This season ended for me the same way it began: utter shock and awe. Full disclosure: I turned down a chance to see this live. My son had just gotten into town, he was against going because he wanted to play and have a chill day. I wasn't thrilled about driving five hours and was miserable with double impacted ear drums. So although my mom was very gung ho about doing a weekend trek down to Audi West, I passed. They were playing the team that massacred them. It'll be over early in the 3rd, my son is going to get bored and demand we leave. I'm in a wheelchair, so going anywhere is a fun little production. I just didn't have the energy for that AND double impacted ear drums aren't fun. So I opted to watch live on ESPN+ while my son read Animorphs on the couch, occasionally looking up at the score. It was over by the 3rd but not the way I predicted. WOW. That's my only analysis of the game itself other than I love 4-12. Added suspense there for a bit.*

-----  

#**High Points**

* Obviously, the last game of the year. The football gods finally granted their blessings. It came against a team I would have fully honored to put over inorder to grant another fanbase, one that has also seen some troubling times, a trophy. I'm fully prepared to do the job in return, see y'all in a few months Detroit. It happened in Audi West, so that's definitely a thing now. 
 
* The St. Louis playoff game. I thought this was going to be the High Point because surely we weren't winning that final game. Oopsie.

* Beating the Stallions in Week 1. I had spent the whole off-season dogging DC. Coming off the Commander's rebirth season, the fanbase was going to need a breather and enthusiasm around the team was at a low point. Not only did we get a upset W, but our HC yelled at Skip after the game. We may go like 4-6 again, I thought, but I am going to have so much fun watching the naughty bad boys. 

-----  

#**Low Points**

* Losing to Houston. I talked a massive amount of shit about CJ. The fact we actually lost to him, despite whoever played, is a massive stain on my integrity.

* The 38-14 Michigan massacre in the regular season. I wasn't expecting anything but damn that got way awful to watch and I was half paying attention, half doing other things.

* The Memphis Showboats game. Huh? Y'all won! Yes, but that's the kind of game I would walk into the team room Monday pissed as hell. Jordan missing guys, defense giving up plays at the worst time. It was nasty. Y'all saw what can happen when Jordan has a great day in the title game. This game is what happens when he's off.

*The offense improved or stayed the same in almost every category.
*The improvement in giveaways has to be mentioned when looking for reasons why this 2025 Defenders team was successful. 
*The deep passing game was deadly when it hit and they put on a clinic in the title game.
*The run game stayed about the same if you just study the stats but I got the impression it was far more impactful in the game flow this year, as it felt opposing defenses needed to respect it more 
*Building on that last point, we saw the Defenders run over the Battlehawks in the playoffs so it felt like if they had featured it more in the game plan, better overall numbers could have been had.

##**PFF Oline Grades**

* Continuity was night and day different from ‘24, as the Defenders enjoyed a season with a stable front 5. 
* 5 guys played over 430 snaps.
* Yasir Durant made All-UFL and was one of the best lineman in the league.
* Adding depth and keeping this unit strong needs to be a priority.

*The Bad Man is forever gone!
*The stats themselves are similar to last years, the defense against the pass got slightly worse while the run defense improved.
* The points allowed ranking is exactly the same as last year.
* The biggest difference in the W/L column is that they forced more turnovers, with both interceptions and fumbles recovered increasing.
* They also saw a jump in sacks that helped force opponents into more obvious passing downs which in turn helped in forcing more turnovers.

##**Some Individual Statistics**

###*Ta’amu*

|**Player**|**Number of Attempts**|**Completion %**|**Passing Yards**|Y/A|**Passing Yards/Game**|*TD/ Int*|**Times Sacked**|**Rating**|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|’25 Ta’amu|285|54.4|2,153|7.6|215.3|17/4 |7|92.9|

|Up/Down|Up|Down|Up|Up|Up|Up|Up|Up|

* A year removed from me stating I would be fine with some competition for Ta’amu, he returned to his XFL numbers, improving in almost every category.
* The one category that went down? Completion %.
* The broadcasts were quick to explain away the dip in % by saying it's only because DC threw deep more.
* Ta’amu did improve his YPA by a whole yard but I would point to the Memphis game as caution against attributing his drop in completion % solely to “they threw deep more”. 
* He's who he is and is going to have bad accuracy days.
* After playing the game of his life in this year's UFL championship game, the QB job in DC is firmly his for the future.

###*Rushing ’25 vs ‘24*

|**Player**|**Rushing Attempts**|**Rushing Yards**|**Rushing Average**|**Rushing Touchdowns**|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|

|‘25 A. Smith|101|285|2.82|1|
|‘24 C. Harris |83|253|3.05|4|


* Deon Jackson stepped up huge for DC, and allowed Smith to get his mojo back slowly.
*Jackson’s YPC was excellent and the running game wasn’t the primary focus of the offense but largely effective when called upon.
*Adding another RB this offseason as insurance is paramount.

###*Receiving ‘’25 vs ‘24*

|J. Hammond |34|331|9.74|1|
|C. Blair |25|584|23.36 |3|

* After last season where the targets were primarily focused on three options, Ta’amu returned to his XFL form by spreading the ball around.
* Ty Scott was on pace for a great year but got hurt Week 3.
* Chris Rowland and Cornell Powell stepped up huge when Scott went down, allowing the Defenders offense to hardly miss a beat. 

----  

#**Roster Review**

##**All-UFL**

*Chris Rowland (WR), Yasir Durant (LT), Joe Wallace (DT), Derick Roberson (EDGE), Anthony Hines (LB), Deandre Baker (CB)*

##**Strength**

*The deep passing game became a key strength of this team. Jordan’s YPA went up as a result and they were first in the league in Pass Yard/Game.*

*Deon Jackson and Abram Smith rotated nicely and Jackson averaged 5.02 ypc. Going into the season, finding someone to help carry the load while Smith continued to recover from an ACL was paramount and the Defenders got it in Jackson.*

*After Ty Scott went down, the passing game didn’t miss a beat. Rowland and Powell kept Jordan largely satisfied.*

*DC’s O-Line play was clearly stronger in 2025 than it was in 2024, thanks largely in part to more stability.*

##Weakness 

*”Completion % Allowed” would be the first metric I’d point to as a problematic trend that needs to be fixed.*

*Creativity in the RedZone was something I found to be really lacking at points, especially early in the season.*

*We are still 6th in points and yards allowed. The bliss of ridding ourselves of the bad man allowed me to give them a pass temporarily but that time is up*

-----  

#**Coaching Staff Review**

*Shannon Harris, HC:*

Before the playoff run, I was ready to ship his ass off. I liked the renewed energy on the sideline. I liked his chip for being called a doorman. I didn't like that week in and week out, he refused to make basic gamesmanship decisions. The other team intentionally causes a delay of game to give them 5 more yards of space to try to pin you deep? Well duh, you decline that. NOPE! When I saw him do that, I unleashed on my TV. That’s gamesmanship I did all the time coaching HIGH SCHOOL. How is this hard? I was calling him “The Amateur” and was fully ready to go 0-1 in the playoffs and get this cleanout started. Then we ran over the Battlehawks and at the award ceremony he called the Dome “Audi West.” Ok, fine, cute. Get demolished in the championship, and you can ride off into the sunset. He won. OK, well you’re probably coming back but at least spend the offseason taking Gamesmanship 101. Then it was leaked he was joining Reggie in Tennessee and frankly I was writing him off again. Supposedly he’s going to try doubling as the HC again regardless? I am extremely skeptical you can handle two positions at once, especially at this level.

*Gregg Williams/ Blake Williams, DC:*

The bad man is gone! After The Bad Man pissed off to Tennessee, I gave Blake a hall pass for the rest of the season so I could bask in the bliss of two deep in no brainer spots. I would assume he returns for ‘26 and that’s when I am going to critique him normally. Points and yards allowed need to improve.

*Fred Kaiss, OC:*

This year’s Assistant of the Year really rebounded from the 2024 levels. The offense didn’t exactly return to the 2023 XFL form, where it got to the point where as a fan I just was confident we’d score whenever we touched the ball, and the Red Zone struggled a bit in my opinion, especially early. But, he found a better hurry up flow and quickly leaned on a deep passing game. In the playoffs, he put on two masterclasses. After running over the Battlehawks, he reverted to a deep passing game for the championship which was executed brilliantly and caught the Panthers off guard. There’s still room for improvement, I’d like to see a return to using the QB as a threat to use his legs. But Kaiss is returning to the team in ‘26 and I look forward to the next evolution of this offense, which was more than I could say last year.

-----  

#**2025 Offseason**

##**2025 Draft** 

Doing the draft BEFORE NFL training camps made little sense and I am happy to see that was one of the first off-season adjustments that the league made. Now tentatively slated for September 2nd, which is after this gets released, DC will be assuming its rightful spot at the end of the draft order this year. BPA, keep the lines well stocked with talent on both sides of the ball, and how about we actually sign 1-2 players we draft to our actual roster this year?

*Editor’s Note: It has been reported the UFL College Draft is being further delayed to September 23rd.*

##**Team Needs**

O-line depth is at the top of my list. Our starting LT and G are currently in NFL camps and they were among your best. DC enjoyed a year of stability all along the line after a tumultuous year in ‘24. Keeping this group roughly together this off-season while adding quality depth should be the top priority. I’d also keep the RB and DL depth up. 

Finally, I’m more invested this year in getting our core to return to the team. With the added twist of a UFL free agency, Von Hutchins is going to need to really step it up. Coming from the spoiled position I’m in with Adam Peters on the other team, Von’s background remains unimpressive. He’s going to have many key decisions about the direction of the team moving forward.

----

#**Outlook**

Like the rest of the UFL atm, the final outlook for this team is murky. Whose returning? Can Shannon Harris really do a double shift this year? Can DC return the majority of its guys? 
 
That last one is a big one. Team building year to year in the UFL is much more fluid than in the NFL atm and the only constants really are your Coaching Staff.  Since I was skeptical of Harris and his decision to try dual positions, I have no firm confidence that the ‘26 Defenders will achieve the same heights it did with the two best playoff games of my football fandom in ‘25. 

One of DC’s weak points this year was the inconsistent play of their defensive unit. This is something that will have to be addressed in the offseason regardless of who returns.  It was a thrilling season for the DC Defenders with a great culture, but ‘26 won’t care what the team did in ‘25. I am tentatively putting them at 6-4 again with the WC birth but I will be anxiously watching the roster developments.

-----  

#**The DC Market**

[In last year's 8 in 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitedFootballLeague/comments/1etogrn/8_teams8_days_day_4_the_dc_defenders/), I took a very pessimistic view of the state of the DC market in respect to the hype for the Defenders specifically. A year removed and the football gods have blessed me both with Jaysus and a UFL championship in a year I didn't think we'd make the playoffs. My football fandom suffered it’s formative years under Dan Snyder, so great start football gods but keep going til I tell you to stop.

Thus, I am going to be happier this year. First, I want to point out though: I was right. DC attendance was down this year from the year before, which was also slightly down from XFL levels. The Non-St. Louis' attendance title was very much up for grabs. The rest of the markets dropped the ball. Michigan, you have graduated to the big kids table. Too bad your stadium is being a jerk. The rest of you get it together. 

This upcoming year won’t be as easy. After the party we threw for the Defenders down at the wharf and what was a well covered facetime with the mayor, DC’s local popularity has grown. I expect a slight uptick in attendance, not to XFL levels but a return to its ‘24 UFL numbers.

-----  

#**Final Remarks**
Thank you for reading! I know it's a big wall of text so if you stuck around this far, you are special to me.

Thanks again to /u/Callywood for organizing this series, it's a great way to do a deep AAR on the ‘25 season. Thank you for allowing me to be a part of it again obviously, but also for stat diving and editing. 

I can almost guarantee there are mistakes and will do edits to correct.

1n397f3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1n397f3/should_you_trust_orangesol_stain_remover_on_tough/,Should You Trust Orange-Sol Stain Remover on Tough Laundry Marks?,"It’s not every day that a laundry product genuinely surprises me, but the Orange-Sol 11823 stain remover caught my attention the moment I put it to the test. As someone who constantly battles relentless stains, whether from red wine accidents, baby food chaos, or even mystery smudges that appear post-laundry, I’ll admit I was skeptical. Could this unassuming 12-ounce bottle really handle the messes life throws my way? Turns out, it does—and then some. Having tried other stain removers in the past with mixed results, I gave this product a go, curious to see if it lived up to its online hype. Spoiler alert: it’s officially earned a permanent spot on my laundry shelf.

**Design & Packaging**  
The Orange-Sol 11823 comes in a straightforward, practical spray bottle that’s easy to grip and operate. The nozzle feels sturdy, and it sprays in a fine mist rather than an overwhelming jet of liquid that could saturate spots unnecessarily. I like that you can control how much product goes onto the fabric or stain. It’s also compact enough to fit neatly into my laundry kit without taking up excessive room. In terms of aesthetics, it doesn’t scream luxury, but it isn’t pretending to be fancy either. This is a no-nonsense stain remover, presented simply, with clear instructions guiding you through the usage process.  

**Ease of Use**  
Each time I’ve used this remover, it’s been ridiculously straightforward. I appreciate products that don’t require a biochemist-level understanding to operate. Whether it’s fresh stains or the dreaded after-dryer smudges—yes, it tackles those as well—all you need is a quick spray, a bit of wiping, and a rinse. And for tougher marks? A short pre-soak works wonders. My roommate, who somehow spills coffee three out of five work mornings, tested it on his white shirt yesterday. Just a quick pre-treatment before washing transformed what looked like a lost cause into a perfectly spotless garment.

**Highlights**  
- Effectively removes fresh stains, stubborn smudges, and even set-in spots post-dryer.  
- Safe for use on various materials: laundry, carpets, and even upholstery.  
- Retains the texture and color of fabrics, so clothing stays as good as new.

**Performance During Testing**  
What struck me first was its versatility. This remover didn’t just excel on laundry; I tried it on a stained couch cushion and a spaghetti sauce-laden tablecloth. Both came out nearly pristine. It's incredibly reliable for a DIY enthusiast like me, who constantly spills paint and ink during projects. It’s also proven handy for removing hair dye stains, which is a lifesaver after at-home touch-up sessions. But here's the kicker: it doesn't compromise fabric quality. My pricey linen table runner, normally delicate, showed no fading, stiffness, or compromise in its texture. This was a pleasant surprise, especially when compared to harsher removers I’ve used that leave clothing feeling stiff after treatment.

**Target Users**  
Busy parents, messy eaters, or really anyone prone to accidental stains will find this product invaluable. It’s also a game-changer for anyone in creative fields or those who love at-home projects (looking at you, DIY crafters and amateur hair colorists). Pet owners may benefit, too, since it seems equally adept at eradicating mystery marks on rugs left by furry friends. The versatility is a huge draw—its ability to work across laundry, upholstery, and even carpets means fewer products cluttering your shelves. And let’s not forget those like my coworker, whose clumsy coffee habits make this an almost daily necessity.  

**Downsides**  
As effective as it is, there’s always room for growth.  
- The citrus scent might be overwhelming for some people who prefer unscented cleaning solutions.  
- It’s slightly pricier than some basic stain removers on the market.  
- Not the most ideal for mega-spills or instances where you’d prefer a foam-based product for deep penetration.  

**Industry Competitors**  
Compared to other stain removers I’ve experimented with, this one stands out for its sheer versatility. Other sprays like Shout Advanced may work similarly on laundry stains but often leave fabrics feeling brittle. Products like OxiClean, while great for bath towels and jeans, sometimes struggle with delicate materials. In terms of faster action, Orange-Sol outpaces Carbona Color Grabber & Stain Remover, especially for post-dryer marks. However, if cost is a prime concern, some budget-friendly options may appeal to those willing to compromise on quality for a cheaper rate. I’d still argue this product earns its spot for its ability to consistently deliver stain-free results across such a vast array of materials.

**Value Proposition**  
While pricing varies, the quality you’re getting makes this one of the better investments among laundry products. Some stain removers can become an endless cycle of trial and error, either barely fading stains or outright ruining fabrics. Here you get a balance of powerful action and fabric safety. If you’re someone who values peace of mind and hates re-washing clothes or scrubbing endlessly, this product is worth your consideration. Whether it’s baby clothes, professional shirts, or even vintage bed sheets, it just works.

1n396g8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1n396g8/i_always_have_a_headache/,I always have a headache,"38m 6’ 280lbs

High cholesterol and major depressive disorder, both well maintained. I take Vilazodone(40mg daily) and Rosuvastatin (40 mg daily).
Apologies in advance for all the detail that follows. It’s been a long and frustrating journey. Bloodwork has been completed regularly throughout the last 5 years and aside from cholesterol ratios (low HDL) and low-ish testosterone (300-ish) results haven’t shown anything interesting.

I have been experiencing constant headaches for the last 5+ years. Onset was gradual with no obvious cause. Pain is almost always a 3, sometimes up to a 6, and never less than a 2. They are accompanied by dizziness, light headedness, brain fog, difficulty finding words, difficulty concentrating, and very mild tinnitus. No sensitivity to sound, lights, smells, etc.. the only time my discomfort is slightly improved is when I’m laying down. I have had occasional episodes of vertigo lasting from a few seconds to a couple of days. 3 episodes in the last 5 years, never prior.

Around the time of onset I did have a pinched nerve in my neck. Again no obvious onset here - slept on it funny or something. The associated tingling in the arm went away with physical therapy.

I saw a neurologist for the pinched nerve and he ordered a brain & spine MRI. Results were unremarkable except for the mildly slipped disc/pinched nerve in my neck. I saw another neurologist who tried treating the headache with a variety of medications, including but not limited to topiramate, NSAID, Sumatriptan, CGRP, and Botox. None of them lead to any improvement in symptoms whatsoever.

The neurologist posed that the symptoms may be related to the 2 anti-depressants I was taking at the time (Effexor & Wellbutrin). I tapered off of them (with psych approval) and had no improvement over the course of 6 months. I ended up starting back up on a “newer” antidepressant after that as a result of significant worsening in depression symptoms. I was referred to a cardiologist to see if it may be POTS or something else cardiology related. Cardiac ultrasound was normal. Stress test showed vasovagal syncope but negative for POTS.
Around this time my psych thought perhaps my symptoms were anxiety related. I enrolled in an outpatient anxiety support group and found that while I could somewhat relate to some of the symptoms, my anxiety is exceptionally mild (nervous in social situations, avoid confrontation, etc.).

After that the psych tried to address the difficulty with attention using adderall. Interestingly, this was the most effective medication I took to improve any symptoms, but I found the downsides of the meds to be hard to overcome (trouble sleeping, short tempter, etc.). Eventually I got my PCP to refer me to a major academic university. I saw approximately 5 different neurologists there with varying specialties and was referred to a headache clinic. The headache clinic had me reduce caffeine intake (3 cups of coffee -> 2 or less daily). No improvement. They referred me for a sleep study. Sleep study showed mild sleep apnea. Got a CPAP and wore it daily for over a year with zero improvement to symptoms. The headache clinic also referred me to a specialist who was doing a study related to spontaneous CSF leaks. Physician had me take some self-assessments at home and eventually suggested I would be a candidate for more invasive imaging (CT myleogram with contrast injected in the spine) followed by an epidural blood patch.

Although the imaging was negative, the doctor suggested I would still have a ~30% chance of having a CSF leak that didn’t show up in imaging. He identified a few areas that looked “suspicious”. I ended up getting 4 different blood patches to attempt and fix the suspicious areas. Although I would have improvement in symptoms for a few days during recovery (I would lay flat), the improvement never lasted.

The academic medical center neurologist team also referred me to Otolarynogy for vestibular testing (VNG, vHIT, VEMP and rotary chair). Results showed very minor defects in vestibular function and I was referred for vestibular physical therapy. Completed ~6 months of rehab and didn’t notice any improvement of symptoms. BPPV and vestibular migraines were ruled out.


There may be additional testing/treatment I’m forgetting at the moment. I took a break from treatment and visits for the last ~6 months because I was honestly exhausted from all the appointments and lack of answers. But I’m ready to start up again and would like to find ways to either improve quality of life despite the symptoms (already doing CBT to address this), or actually get answers/ improve symptoms (daring to dream here).

I guess my question is…. Where the hell do I go from here? Is going back to the headache clinic at the academic medical center the right thing? Do I go back and see a neurologist again? Do I try and find some other resource?",1,1756478251.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1n3965g,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyTabPOS/comments/1n3965g/common_questions_pos/,Common Questions P.O.S.,"# What Features Should I Look for in a POS System?

As an independent restaurant or retail owner, you might be pondering, ""What features should I look for in a point-of-sale system?"" This is a crucial question because choosing the right POS system can significantly impact your daily operations, customer service, and ultimately, your bottom line.

## Why Is This an Important Concern?

A well-chosen POS system can streamline operations, improve customer satisfaction, and provide valuable insights into your business. Conversely, a poor choice can lead to inefficiencies, errors, and frustration. Understanding the core features to look for will help you make an informed decision and keep your business running smoothly.

## Direct Answer

The ideal POS system for a small business should include the following features:

1. **User-Friendly Interface**
   Your staff should be able to learn and use the system quickly. A complicated interface can slow down service and frustrate employees.

2. **Inventory Management**
   This feature helps you keep track of your stock levels in real time, ensuring you never run out of popular items and reduces wastage.

3. **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**
   A built-in CRM can store customer data, track purchase history, and help you tailor marketing efforts.

4. **Sales Reporting and Analytics**
   Access to detailed sales reports and analytics can offer insights into what’s selling and help you make informed decisions.

5. **Integration with Other Tools**
   Your POS should integrate seamlessly with accounting software, online ordering platforms, and payment processors.

6. **Mobile Capabilities**
   Mobile POS systems can increase flexibility by allowing transactions to be processed anywhere in the store or restaurant.

7. **Employee Management**
   Features like clock-in/clock-out, payroll management, and sales tracking per employee can enhance workforce management.

8. **Security Features**
   Ensure your POS comes with robust security features to protect sensitive customer data and comply with payment card industry standards.

## Breakdown / Scenario Example

Imagine you run a small café. Customers appreciate quick and friendly service, and your inventory includes everything from fresh pastries to specialty coffee beans. Here's how the ideal POS system would work for you:

- On a busy morning, your user-friendly POS enables new employees to take orders efficiently, reducing wait times and customer frustration.
- As you’re running low on croissants, the inventory management feature sends you an alert, allowing you to restock before running out.
- A regular customer comes in, and the CRM quickly pulls up their last purchase. You suggest a new product they're likely to enjoy, enhancing their experience.
- After the morning rush, you check the sales analytics and notice that blueberry muffins are selling exceptionally well today. You decide to bake an extra batch in the afternoon.

## Quick Takeaways

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Essential for quick training and efficient service.
- **Inventory Management:** Prevents stock-outs and overstock.
- **CRM:** Enhances customer engagement and marketing.
- **Sales Reporting:** Enables data

1n395ov,https://i.redd.it/b1a9wywfzylf1.png,I built an AI automation that generates unlimited eCommerce ad creative using Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image),"Google’s Nano Banana image model was just released this week (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) and I've seen some pretty crazy demos on Twitter on what people have been doing with creating and editing images.

One thing that is really interesting to me is its [image fusion](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemini-2-5-flash-image/) feature that allow you to provide two separate images in an API request and ask the model to merge them together into a final image. This has a ton of use cases for eCommerce companies where you can simply provide a picture of your product + reference images of influencers to the model and you can instantly get back ad creative. No need to pay for a photographer, book studio space, and go through the time consuming and expensive process to get these assets made.

I wanted to see if I could build a system that automates this whole process. The system starts with a simple file upload as the input to the automation and will kick everything off. After that's uploaded, it's then going to look to a Google Drive folder I've set up that has all the influencers I want to use for this batch. I then process each influencer image and will create a final output ad-creative image with the influencer holding it in their hand. In this case, I'm using a Stanley Cup as an example. The whole thing can be scaled up to handle as many images as you need, just upload more influencer reference images.

Here's a demo video that shows the inputs and outputs of what I was able to come up with: https://youtu.be/TZcn8nOJHH4

## Here's how the automation works

### 1. Setup and Data Storage

The first step here is actually going to be sourcing all of your reference influencer images. I built this one just using Google Drive as the storage layer, but you could replace this with anything like a database, cloud bucket, or whatever best fits your needs. Google Drive is simple, and so that made sense here for my demo. 

- All influencer images just get stored in a single folder.
- I source these using a royalty-free website like Unsplash, but you can also leverage other AI tools and AI models to generate hyper-realistic influencers if you want to scale this out even further and don't want to worry about loyalties.
- For each influencer you upload, that is going to control the number of outputs you get for your ad creative.

### 2. Workflow Trigger and Image Processing

The automation kicks off with a simple form trigger that accepts a single file upload:

- The automation starts off with a simple form trigger that accepts your product image. Once that gets uploaded, I use the extractor file node to convert that to a base64 string, which is required for using images with Gemini's API.
- After that's done, I then do a simple search node to iterate over all of the influencer photos in my Google Drive created from before. That way, we're able to get a list of file IDs we can later loop over for creating each image.
- Since that just gives back the IDs, I then need to split out and do a batch of one on top of each of those ID file IDs returned back from Google Drive. That way we can process adding our product photo into the hands of the influencer one by one.
    - And then once again, after the influencer image gets loaded or downloaded, we have to convert it to a base64 string in order to work with the Gemini API.

### 3. Generate the Image w/ Nano Banana

Now that we're inside the loop for our influencer image, we just download it's time to combine the base64 string we had from our product with the current influencer image. We're looping over in order to pass that off to Gemini. And so in order to do this, we're making a simple POST request to this URL: `generativeai.googleapis.com/v1/models/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview:generateContent`

And then for the body, we need to provide an object that contains the contents and parts of the request. This is going to be things like the text prompt that's going to be required to tell Gemini and Nano Banana what to do. This is going to be also where we specify inline data for both images that we need to get fused together. 

Here's how my request looks like in this node:

- `text` is the prompt to use (mine is customized for the stanley cup and setting up a good scene)
- the inline_data fields correspond to each image we need “fused” together.
    - You can actually add in more than 2 here if you need

```markdown
{
  ""contents"": [{
    ""parts"": [
      { ""text"": ""Create an image where the cup/tumbler in image 1 is being held by the person in the 2nd image (like they are about to take a drink from the cup). The person should be sitting at a table at a cafe or coffee shop and is smiling warmly while looking at the camera. This is not a professional photo, it should feel like a friend is taking a picture of the person in the 2nd image. Only return the final generated image. The angle of the image should instead by slightly at an angle from the side (vary this angle)."" },
      {
        ""inline_data"": {
          ""mime_type"": ""image/png"",
          ""data"": ""{{ $node['product_image_to_base64'].json.data }}""
        }
      },
      {
        ""inline_data"": {
          ""mime_type"": ""image/jpeg"",
          ""data"": ""{{ $node['influencer_image_to_base_64'].json.data }}""
        }
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### 4. Output Processing and Storage

Once Gemini generates each ad creative, the workflow processes and saves the results back to a Google Drive folder I have specified:

- Extracts the generated image data from the API response (found under `candidates.content.parts.inline_data`)
- Converts the returned base64 string back into an image file format
- Uploads each generated ad creative to a designated output folder in Google Drive
- Files are automatically named with incremental numbers (Influencer Image #1, Influencer Image #2, etc.)

Life has a peculiar way of throwing curveballs when we least expect them. One moment you're cruising along with your five-year plan, and the next, you're staring at circumstances that seem to mock every assumption you've ever made about how things should work.

## 🎭 The Paradox of Not Knowing

Picture this: You're standing at a crossroads in thick fog. You can't see which path leads where, yet you must choose a direction. This scenario isn't just metaphorical – it's the reality we face countless times throughout our lives.

Whether you're dealing with a career change that feels risky, a relationship that's hit an uncertain phase, or a health challenge that has no clear timeline, the common thread is the same: **you don't have all the answers, but life demands that you keep moving forward anyway.**

The interesting thing about uncertainty isn't that it's uncomfortable – that's obvious. It's that our discomfort with not knowing often becomes more problematic than the actual unknown situation itself.

## 🧠 Why Our Brains Hate Uncertainty

From an evolutionary perspective, uncertainty meant potential danger. Our ancestors who were constantly vigilant about unknown threats were more likely to survive. This means we're literally wired to find uncertainty stressful.

But here's what's fascinating: **the most significant growth in human history has happened precisely because someone was willing to trust the process despite not knowing the outcome.**

Think about it:
- Every entrepreneur who started a business
- Every couple who decided to have children
- Every student who chose a field of study
- Every person who moved to a new city

None of them had guarantees. They all took leaps of trust.

## 🚀 Practical Strategies for Embracing Uncertainty

### 1. **Focus on What You Can Control**

Instead of obsessing over outcomes you can't predict, channel your energy into actions you can take today. 

**Daily Practice:** Each morning, write down three things within your control that you can work on, regardless of external circumstances.

### 2. **Develop Your ""Trust Muscle""**

Trust isn't just a feeling – it's a skill you can strengthen through practice.

**Start Small:** Begin with low-stakes situations. Trust that the new restaurant will be decent, trust that taking a different route to work won't ruin your day, trust that trying a new hobby won't be a waste of time.

**Build Up:** As you prove to yourself that uncertainty doesn't always lead to disaster, you'll feel more confident tackling bigger unknowns.

### 3. **Reframe Uncertainty as Adventure**

The same situation can feel terrifying or exciting depending on how you frame it. A job interview isn't just a potential rejection – it's also a potential opportunity. A first date isn't just a risk of awkwardness – it's also a chance for connection.

**Mental Shift Exercise:** When facing uncertainty, ask yourself: ""What if this turns out better than I expected?""

### 4. **Create Your Own Certainties**

While you can't control outcomes, you can control your commitments to yourself.

**Personal Anchors:**
- ""I will show up and give my best effort""
- ""I will treat myself with kindness regardless of results""
- ""I will learn something valuable from this experience""
- ""I will maintain my values no matter what happens""

## 🌱 The Growth Mindset Connection

People who thrive in uncertainty often share a common trait: they view challenges as opportunities to develop resilience rather than threats to their security.

**Consider this perspective:** Every time you navigate uncertainty successfully, you're building evidence for yourself that you can handle whatever comes next. You're literally becoming more capable.

## 💼 Uncertainty in Career Decisions

Let's get practical. Say you're considering a career change but you're paralyzed by all the unknowns:
- Will you be good at the new role?
- Will you earn enough money?
- What if you regret leaving your current job?

**Actionable Approach:**
1. **Information gathering phase:** Research the field, talk to people in that industry, perhaps take a course or volunteer in a related capacity
2. **Small experiments:** Can you freelance in this area while keeping your current job? Can you shadow someone for a day?
3. **Decision deadline:** Set a date by which you'll make a choice, preventing endless deliberation
4. **Trust your preparation:** Once you've done reasonable research, trust that you've equipped yourself to handle whatever comes next

## 💕 Uncertainty in Relationships

Relationships are perhaps the ultimate exercise in uncertainty. You're constantly making decisions based on incomplete information about another person's thoughts, feelings, and future choices.

**Healthy Relationship Trust:**
- Trust that you can communicate through difficulties
- Trust that both people are capable of growth
- Trust that showing vulnerability won't destroy you
- Trust that you can handle whatever the relationship brings, including its potential end

This doesn't mean being naive or ignoring red flags. It means being willing to be open and authentic despite not knowing exactly how the other person will respond.

## 🏥 Navigating Health Challenges

Health scares are particularly challenging because they force us to confront our mortality and the limits of our control.

**Coping Strategies:**
- Focus on following medical advice rather than obsessing over prognoses
- Trust that your body has incredible healing capabilities
- Trust that you can adapt to whatever challenges arise
- Build a support network you can lean on during tough times

## 📈 Financial Uncertainty

Money worries can keep us up at night, but they also provide excellent opportunities to practice trust.

**Financial Trust Building:**
- Trust that developing valuable skills will lead to opportunities
- Trust that living below your means gives you options
- Trust that being generous when possible creates positive cycles
- Trust that you can find creative solutions to financial challenges

## 🌍 Global Perspective: Why This Matters Now More Than Ever

We live in an era of unprecedented change. Technology, climate, economics, and social structures are all evolving rapidly. The ability to remain functional and optimistic despite uncertainty isn't just helpful – it's essential.

**Future-Proofing Yourself:**
- Develop adaptability as a core skill
- Build diverse relationships and support networks
- Maintain physical and mental health as your foundation
- Stay curious and keep learning
- Practice gratitude to maintain perspective

## 🎯 The Compound Effect of Small Acts of Trust

Here's something remarkable: every small act of trust you practice today builds your capacity for larger acts of trust tomorrow.

**Daily Trust Builders:**
- Trust that exercising today will benefit you even if you don't see immediate results
- Trust that being kind to a stranger matters even if you never see the impact
- Trust that learning something new will serve you somehow, even if you can't yet see how
- Trust that taking care of your mental health will pay dividends you can't currently measure

## 🔄 When Trust Feels Impossible

Let's be honest – sometimes you've been burned. Sometimes past experiences make trust feel foolish or dangerous.

**Recovery Strategies:**
- Start by trusting yourself to handle whatever comes
- Acknowledge that past pain was real without letting it dictate your future choices
- Practice discernment – trust doesn't mean being reckless
- Seek support when needed – trusting others to help you rebuild trust

## 🌈 The Unexpected Benefits of Uncertainty

Once you develop comfort with uncertainty, you might discover some surprising advantages:

**Enhanced Creativity:** When you can't rely on familiar solutions, you're forced to think innovatively.

**Deeper Connections:** Vulnerability in the face of uncertainty often leads to more authentic relationships.

**Increased Resilience:** Each successfully navigated uncertain situation builds your confidence for future challenges.

**Present Moment Awareness:** When you can't predict the future, you naturally become more focused on the present.

**Appreciation for Simple Pleasures:** Uncertainty helps you value what you have right now.

## 🎪 Living as an Experiment

What if you approached your life as an ongoing experiment rather than a test you might fail?

**Experimental Mindset:**
- Every decision is a hypothesis to test
- ""Failure"" is just data that helps refine your next hypothesis
- The goal isn't to be right all the time, but to keep learning and adjusting
- Curiosity becomes more important than certainty

## 🏃‍♂️ Action Steps for This Week

Ready to put this into practice? Here are concrete steps you can take:

**Day 1-2:** Identify one area of your life where uncertainty is causing you stress. Write down what specifically you're worried about.

**Day 3-4:** List everything within your control related to this situation. Focus only on these items.

**Day 5-6:** Take one small action toward addressing the situation, even without knowing the outcome.

**Day 7:** Reflect on how it felt to act despite uncertainty. What did you learn about yourself?

## 🌟 The Long View

Remember, humans have been dealing with uncertainty for thousands of years. Our ancestors faced famines, wars, plagues, and countless personal challenges without the benefit of weather forecasts, medical knowledge, or communication technology we take for granted today.

Yet they persisted. They built families, communities, and civilizations. They created art, discovered scientific principles, and passed down wisdom that still guides us today.

**You carry this same resilience in your DNA.**

The uncertainty you're facing today – whether it's about your career, relationships, health, or finances – is part of the human experience that connects you to every person who has ever lived.

## 🎁 The Gift of Not Knowing

Perhaps the most radical idea is that uncertainty itself is a gift.

**Consider this:** If you knew exactly how everything would turn out, would you still take risks? Would you still grow? Would life hold the same sense of wonder and possibility?

Uncertainty keeps us humble, curious, and alive to possibility. It forces us to develop courage, compassion, and resilience. It makes our victories sweeter and our connections deeper.

## 🚪 Your Next Chapter Starts Now

As you close this article and return to your day, you'll likely face dozens of small uncertainties. The weather, traffic, how your meetings will go, whether your text messages will be well-received, if your dinner plans will work out.

Each one is an opportunity to practice trust. Not blind faith, but informed confidence in your ability to handle whatever comes.

**Your homework is simple:** For the next week, notice when uncertainty arises and practice responding with curiosity rather than anxiety. See what happens when you approach the unknown as an adventure rather than a threat.

The fog at life's crossroads never fully clears, but you don't need perfect visibility to take the next step. Trust that you have everything you need to navigate whatever comes next.

After all, you've made it this far, haven't you? That's proof enough that you can handle what's ahead.

	•	I’m considering applying at Starbucks because of the ASU Online program. They offer tuition-free degrees, and that feels like a huge opportunity to work + study at the same time without taking on debt. My fear is leaving stable income too soon, or finding out it’s not as good as it seems.
	•	Another plan I’ve been thinking about is starting at Nashville State Community College for the first two years, then transferring to Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) as a junior to finish my bachelor’s in Economics.

My main worries:
	•	What if I pick the wrong path and regret it later?
	•	If I stick with my current job, am I missing out on Starbucks/ASU?
	•	If I go the community college → transfer route, will it be more expensive/stressful than the Starbucks path?

Has anyone here done either of these?
	•	Worked at Starbucks and gone through the ASU program  was it worth it?
	•	Or started at community college and then transferred to a university. How was your experience? Did it feel like a smart move financially and academically?

I just want to make the smartest decision for my future while also keeping myself stable in the short-term. Any insight would really help.",11,1756478167.0,nashville,27,0.78,False
1n3952c,https://www.reddit.com/r/energydrinks/comments/1n3952c/welp/,Welp….,"Always wrote off energy drinks. Tried em over a decade ago in high school, they just weren’t for me. 

I’ve got a weirdo brain. Sativas make me sleepy. Tuna makes me nod off. Hot coffee makes me fall asleep almost immediately (but iced is fine). Loads of anxiety. Constantly stressed. Probably have ADHD. 

Tried a Redbull a few months ago. Within half an hour I could not keep my eyes open. Had to pull over to let my girlfriend drive. 

Anyway, a coworker offered me a Montser last week. Sugar free strawberry dreams or something like that. 

I gotta say. I get it now. I sipped it over the course of a few hours and honestly, I felt great. Alert, focused, fuckin buzzing. No crash. No falling asleep. Anxiety gone. Stress dissipated. Clouded mind gone. 

A few days later he offered me a sugar free peach. Tasted great. Today, I bought one. Went with the strawberry bc the amount of flavors and their names was overwhelming lol. First time spending money on an energy drink since 2011. 

So, what is that? Like what’s the science behind it? I felt fucking gooooood the rest of the day and ended up sleeping damn well, too. ",2,1756478158.0,energydrinks,2,1.0,False

1n393im,https://i.redd.it/yortnw6wyylf1.png,I built an AI automation that generates unlimited eCommerce ad creative using Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image),"Google’s Nano Banana image model was just released this week (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) and I've seen some pretty crazy demos on Twitter on what people have been doing with creating and editing images.

One thing that is really interesting to me is its [image fusion](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemini-2-5-flash-image/) feature that allow you to provide two separate images in an API request and ask the model to merge them together into a final image. This has a ton of use cases for eCommerce companies where you can simply provide a picture of your product + reference images of influencers to the model and you can instantly get back ad creative. No need to pay for a photographer, book studio space, and go through the time consuming and expensive process to get these assets made.

I wanted to see if I could build a system that automates this whole process. The system starts with a simple file upload as the input to the automation and will kick everything off. After that's uploaded, it's then going to look to a Google Drive folder I've set up that has all the influencers I want to use for this batch. I then process each influencer image and will create a final output ad-creative image with the influencer holding it in their hand. In this case, I'm using a Stanley Cup as an example. The whole thing can be scaled up to handle as many images as you need, just upload more influencer reference images.

Here's a demo video that shows the inputs and outputs of what I was able to come up with: https://youtu.be/TZcn8nOJHH4

## Here's how the automation works

### 1. Setup and Data Storage

The first step here is actually going to be sourcing all of your reference influencer images. I built this one just using Google Drive as the storage layer, but you could replace this with anything like a database, cloud bucket, or whatever best fits your needs. Google Drive is simple, and so that made sense here for my demo. 

- All influencer images just get stored in a single folder.
- I source these using a royalty-free website like Unsplash, but you can also leverage other AI tools and AI models to generate hyper-realistic influencers if you want to scale this out even further and don't want to worry about loyalties.
- For each influencer you upload, that is going to control the number of outputs you get for your ad creative.

### 2. Workflow Trigger and Image Processing

The automation kicks off with a simple form trigger that accepts a single file upload:

- The automation starts off with a simple form trigger that accepts your product image. Once that gets uploaded, I use the extractor file node to convert that to a base64 string, which is required for using images with Gemini's API.
- After that's done, I then do a simple search node to iterate over all of the influencer photos in my Google Drive created from before. That way, we're able to get a list of file IDs we can later loop over for creating each image.
- Since that just gives back the IDs, I then need to split out and do a batch of one on top of each of those ID file IDs returned back from Google Drive. That way we can process adding our product photo into the hands of the influencer one by one.
    - And then once again, after the influencer image gets loaded or downloaded, we have to convert it to a base64 string in order to work with the Gemini API.

### 3. Generate the Image w/ Nano Banana

Now that we're inside the loop for our influencer image, we just download it's time to combine the base64 string we had from our product with the current influencer image. We're looping over in order to pass that off to Gemini. And so in order to do this, we're making a simple POST request to this URL: `generativeai.googleapis.com/v1/models/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview:generateContent`

And then for the body, we need to provide an object that contains the contents and parts of the request. This is going to be things like the text prompt that's going to be required to tell Gemini and Nano Banana what to do. This is going to be also where we specify inline data for both images that we need to get fused together. 

Here's how my request looks like in this node:

- `text` is the prompt to use (mine is customized for the stanley cup and setting up a good scene)
- the inline_data fields correspond to each image we need “fused” together.
    - You can actually add in more than 2 here if you need

```markdown
{
  ""contents"": [{
    ""parts"": [
      { ""text"": ""Create an image where the cup/tumbler in image 1 is being held by the person in the 2nd image (like they are about to take a drink from the cup). The person should be sitting at a table at a cafe or coffee shop and is smiling warmly while looking at the camera. This is not a professional photo, it should feel like a friend is taking a picture of the person in the 2nd image. Only return the final generated image. The angle of the image should instead by slightly at an angle from the side (vary this angle)."" },
      {
        ""inline_data"": {
          ""mime_type"": ""image/png"",
          ""data"": ""{{ $node['product_image_to_base64'].json.data }}""
        }
      },
      {
        ""inline_data"": {
          ""mime_type"": ""image/jpeg"",
          ""data"": ""{{ $node['influencer_image_to_base_64'].json.data }}""
        }
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### 4. Output Processing and Storage

Once Gemini generates each ad creative, the workflow processes and saves the results back to a Google Drive folder I have specified:

- Extracts the generated image data from the API response (found under `candidates.content.parts.inline_data`)
- Converts the returned base64 string back into an image file format
- Uploads each generated ad creative to a designated output folder in Google Drive
- Files are automatically named with incremental numbers (Influencer Image #1, Influencer Image #2, etc.)

1n393hc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1n393hc/help_because_i_cannot_help_myself/,Help because I cannot help myself…,"This is a long one. I (27F) used to work with a man (67M) at an insurance brokerage office and at first I thought he was an old creep. I’ve known him about a year and a half now, and he is so intertwined into my life… that I feel like I literally need someone to physically pull me out of this. 

At work, he would sort of test boundaries and I knew he was ogling me. Like very obviously looking at my ass in a gross way, commenting on my outfits. Bought me little gifts. Unfortunately I have tons of trauma and childhood wounds and I started to cling onto him, I liked the attention. We went on a few dates around Christmas 2024 and he kissed me a few times. I fell in love (I know…. ew, gag, I get it. He ran marathons and is in very good shape for his age). 

In January of this year, I needed to get out of an abusive situation. The tenant who lived in his rental house, next door to him passed away and he offered me the place. The lady who passed had loved cats, I love cats and have a cat, I got to keep a lot of her cat-related knick knacks and it seemed serendipitous almost. I was very excited about moving in and having an entire house to decorate for the first time. He said, rent free for 3 months. 

I also lost my license for a short period of time so he drove me to work every day and took me home, though he is semi retired and does not have to stay the whole day. Basically I became very dependent on him very quickly. I was already in love as I said so this did not strike me as a red flag or toxic. I also have no family in my life (literally zero family. Or friends, I’ve moved around a lot. Woe is me.) so it was like a weird crossover of a dad, uncle and a boyfriend. Again, I know… gross. But try telling my heart that. 

Right before I moved in next door to him, we both got drunk one night and he took me home. There was heavy petting but he did not have sex with me. When we woke up in the morning I professed my undying love. He said he was still not over a woman who died in 2005. I look over at the dresser in the room that we just slept in together, and there are several pictures of a woman I’ve never seen before. A fucking shrine. 

I bawled, I threw a tantrum. It still did not sink in to my thick skull and I continued to be in love. Or really I was in denial I guess. I questioned why this man thought it was still okay to make sexual comments and flirtatious gestures if he could not return my love. But that didn’t change how much I wanted to be around him.

The week that I moved in, I asked if we could go out and celebrate because I was so excited. He was not excited at all and blew me off. This was also around Valentine’s Day. He promised flowers and then ghosted me. This CRUSHED me. Like destroyed me. I felt rejected, abandoned, betrayed. “Why would he move me in here and make all of these promises to me if he didn’t somewhat return my feelings, or at least want me to be happy here?” I left out the part where he also arranged for me to stay with his friends for a month, in between moving, who took me in without knowing a thing about me.

I was angry and hurt and admittedly I sent WAY, WAY too many late night texts about how hurt I was. I felt so violated that he wanted access to my body and felt he had the right to make comments to me (for example, coming over to fix something in the house and asking when he could look through the windows to see me naked) without sharing my feelings for him. He knew that I was in love and that he didn’t feel the same so why would he disrespect me in this way? I asked him that question a million different ways. 

I lose my job, where we worked together, after living in his rental for a few weeks. So I am even more upset at this point and will not let it go that he moved me in there just to betray me. I send a lot of nasty texts. I wish I had not but I could not handle not being heard. And discarded. I feel that this was a narcissistic discard on his part. 

In March I get a letter from his lawyer. I am still unemployed and still have no one else but this guy to help me get back on my feet. Letter says I’m being non renewed (on the 3 month “lease” that was only supposed to be a formality for free rent until we renewed on a real lease with real rent payments). It says not to contact him ever again and to call his lawyer if I need anything. I blow up the lawyer’s phone with my “receipts” from our weird more-than-friendship and the lawyer clearly realizes this is not something he wants to deal with because within a week all of that was reversed.

I got my license back in March. But my car would not pass inspection without extensive repairs. I sold it and I’ve been without a car since then. 

I found a part-time job as a waitress and walked to it. In April I found a full time job in my field, in this small town no less, and walked to it for a bit. Still saw him every day because we were neighbors and somewhere in there we mended the “friendship” and my Landlord/Pap/Neighbor/Former Coworker/Unrequited Lover starts including me in his morning coffee shop group again, and taking me to work again, this time to the new job. 

I eventually found another apartment after having to beg for several one-month lease extensions. I still cried and tried to go back to that place. I still begged like a baby to stay. I just did not want to accept that I was never meant to live in that house. I could not accept that he did not want me next to him. I could not accept that he had promised me so many things and then decided I was worthless. 

Fast forward to now. I’ve been in the new place 2 months. Just starting to feel like maybe I can be okay here, maybe I can decorate here, maybe things will be alright. It’s small and old and nothing like the huge house I could have lived in, but my landlord isn’t crossing my boundaries or being unprofessional. 

I still see him every day, twice a day, even on weekends. He takes me to work and picks me up every day. Last weekend we went to a lake and spent the entire day laying on a blanket in the sand together. We watch movies at his place several nights a week while I gaze longingly at the empty house next door. All the while I know this isn’t good for me and I’m just getting more and more attached to someone who will never love me back. 

I’ve tried having a “talk” and pouring my heart out in person. He says that I am just too young and full of life, I have too much time ahead of me, he’s seen it a million times with his buddies where a young girl cheats on them once they get a little bit older. But I can’t emphasize enough how obsessed I am with this man that I know I would be crazy enough to sacrifice my young years for him. If he would just love me back, everything would be right with the world. But he remains steadfast in his position on this. 

If I cut contact with him, I know that will be the best thing for my heart and emotional well being in the long term. I have tried and failed so many times. I always go back to him. Because I won’t have anyone in my life. I mean not a single person other than some coworkers I barely know, and honestly I already don’t like most of them but that’s besides the point. 

I moved to a totally new town when I moved into that rental house. He knew I didn’t know anyone around here. He knows that he is my only lifeline if something goes wrong and to that point, he has shown up to save the day a million times before. To his credit, he will come over to my new place and kill a bug if I ask him to. He will give me a long hug and a pat on the back. But there will never again be kisses and he will never love me. He never did. 

But I can’t get over him. I still want to be around him and it’s ruining my life. I attempted suicide once before by overdosing on propranolol and it’s all I can think about these past six weeks or so, is how much I want to die. I refuse to get rid of the propranolol I still have because I want the option. Every time I have to go home without him I want to die. Every bad day, I want to die. I feel so unloved and worthless yet I am addicted to this merry go round of suffering.

*Transform your planning strategy with this timeless principle that has guided humanity's greatest achievements*

---

## The Power of Looking Beyond Your Own Limitations 🚀

Picture this: You're standing at the edge of a major life decision. Your mind races through countless scenarios, weighing pros and cons, calculating risks, and analyzing every possible outcome. Yet despite all your careful planning, something feels incomplete. There's a missing ingredient that separates those who merely plan from those who consistently achieve extraordinary results.

The secret lies not in trusting your own capabilities alone, but in acknowledging something greater than your individual perspective and limitations.

## Why Self-Reliance Alone Falls Short 🤔

We live in an era that celebrates individual achievement and self-made success stories. While personal effort and skill are undeniably important, research consistently shows that the most successful individuals and organizations share a common trait: they recognize the limitations of their own knowledge and perspective.

Consider these everyday examples:

**The Overconfident Entrepreneur** 📈
Sarah launched her tech startup with complete confidence in her business plan. She relied solely on her market research and personal judgment. Within six months, she discovered critical blind spots in her strategy that could have been avoided by seeking external perspectives and acknowledging what she didn't know.

**The Collaborative Team Leader** 🤝
Mark approached his project management role differently. While he trusted his planning abilities, he also remained open to insights from his team, market conditions, and unexpected opportunities. His projects consistently exceeded expectations because he balanced personal confidence with external awareness.

## The Science Behind Successful Planning 🧠

Modern psychology and behavioral economics reveal fascinating insights about decision-making:

**Cognitive Bias Limitations**: Our brains are wired with numerous biases that can cloud our judgment. Overconfidence bias leads us to overestimate our abilities, while confirmation bias makes us seek information that supports our existing beliefs.

**Collective Intelligence**: Studies show that diverse perspectives and collaborative approaches often yield better outcomes than individual decision-making, regardless of individual expertise levels.

**Adaptive Planning**: The most successful plans aren't rigid blueprints but flexible frameworks that can adapt to changing circumstances and new information.

## Practical Steps to Implement This Success Principle 💡

### 1. Cultivate Intellectual Humility 🎯

Before making any significant decision, ask yourself:
- What don't I know about this situation?
- Who might have insights I'm missing?
- What assumptions am I making that could be wrong?

**Daily Practice**: Start each planning session by writing down three things you're uncertain about regarding your project or decision.

### 2. Seek Diverse Perspectives 🌍

**Personal Life**: Before making major purchases, career changes, or relationship decisions, consult with trusted friends, mentors, or professionals who can offer different viewpoints.

**Professional Life**: Create diverse advisory groups, conduct stakeholder interviews, and regularly seek feedback from people with different backgrounds and expertise.

**Action Step**: For your next important decision, identify at least three people with different perspectives and ask for their honest input.

### 3. Embrace Uncertainty as a Planning Tool 🎲

Instead of trying to eliminate all uncertainty, use it as valuable information:

- Build flexibility into your plans
- Create multiple scenarios and backup strategies
- Set review points to reassess and adjust your approach

**Weekly Exercise**: Every Sunday, review your plans for the week and identify one area where you can build in more flexibility or gather additional information.

### 4. Practice Outcome Detachment 🎯

While working diligently toward your goals, maintain emotional distance from specific outcomes. This doesn't mean caring less about results—it means staying open to better opportunities and solutions you hadn't initially considered.

**Mindset Shift**: Replace ""This must happen exactly as I planned"" with ""I'm committed to the best possible outcome, even if it looks different than I expected.""

## Real-World Applications Across Life Domains 🌈

### Career and Business 💼

**Job Searching**: Instead of relying solely on your own network and research, use platforms that expose you to opportunities you wouldn't have discovered independently. Be open to roles that don't match your exact criteria but offer unexpected growth potential.

**Business Development**: Successful entrepreneurs often describe pivotal moments when they abandoned their original business plans in favor of better opportunities that emerged through market feedback and external circumstances.

### Relationships and Family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

**Parenting Decisions**: The most effective parents combine their instincts with expert advice, community wisdom, and ongoing learning. They remain open to adjusting their approach based on their children's unique needs and changing circumstances.

**Partnership Planning**: Whether in marriage, friendship, or business partnerships, the strongest relationships involve mutual respect for each person's limitations and a shared commitment to growth and adaptation.

### Health and Wellness 🏃‍♀️

**Fitness Goals**: Rather than rigidly following a single workout plan, successful fitness enthusiasts adapt their approach based on their body's response, expert guidance, and changing life circumstances.

**Mental Health**: People who maintain good mental health typically combine self-awareness with professional support, community connections, and evidence-based practices.

### Financial Planning 💰

**Investment Strategy**: The most successful investors combine personal research with professional advice, market awareness, and emotional discipline. They trust the process while remaining flexible about specific outcomes.

**Budget Management**: Effective budgeting involves setting clear goals while remaining adaptable to unexpected expenses and opportunities.

## The Long-Term Impact of This Approach 📅

When you consistently approach planning with humility and openness to external guidance, several powerful things happen:

### Enhanced Decision-Making Quality 🎪
Your decisions improve because they're based on more complete information and diverse perspectives rather than limited personal viewpoints.

### Reduced Stress and Anxiety 😌
Accepting that you don't need to control every variable actually reduces pressure and allows for more creative problem-solving.

### Increased Adaptability 🦆
Plans created with flexibility and external input are more resilient to changing circumstances and unexpected challenges.

### Stronger Relationships 🤗
People appreciate being consulted and valued for their insights, leading to stronger personal and professional networks.

### Accelerated Learning 📚
Regularly seeking external perspectives accelerates your personal and professional development by exposing you to new ideas and approaches.

## Overcoming Common Obstacles 🚧

### ""I Don't Want to Appear Weak"" 💪

**Reframe**: Seeking input isn't weakness—it's strategic intelligence gathering. The most confident leaders regularly consult experts and advisors.

### ""It Takes Too Much Time"" ⏰

**Reality Check**: The time spent gathering perspectives upfront often saves significant time later by avoiding costly mistakes and dead ends.

### ""I Don't Know Who to Ask"" 🤷‍♀️

**Solution**: Start with your existing network, join professional or community groups related to your interests, or use online platforms to connect with experts and peers.

### ""What if I Get Conflicting Advice?"" 🤯

**Approach**: Conflicting perspectives are valuable information, not problems to solve. Use them to better understand the complexity of your situation and make more informed decisions.

## Building Your Personal Success System 🏗️

### Morning Planning Ritual ☀️

Start each day with a five-minute planning session:
1. Review your key objectives
2. Identify one area where you need external input
3. Set aside ego and preconceptions
4. Remain open to unexpected opportunities

### Weekly Reflection Practice 🪞

Every week, spend 15 minutes reviewing:
- Which plans succeeded and why
- Where external input proved valuable
- What assumptions were challenged or changed
- How you can improve your planning process

### Monthly Advisory Sessions 📅

Once per month, have formal or informal conversations with mentors, advisors, or trusted friends about your major goals and challenges.

### Quarterly Strategic Reviews 📊

Every three months, conduct a comprehensive review of your major life areas, seeking external perspectives and adjusting your long-term strategies accordingly.

## The Ripple Effect: How This Transforms Everything 🌊

When you consistently apply this principle across all areas of life, you'll notice a remarkable transformation:

**Your confidence grows** because it's based on solid preparation and multiple perspectives rather than blind optimism.

**Your relationships deepen** because people feel valued when you seek their input and wisdom.

**Your results improve** because your plans are more comprehensive and adaptable.

**Your stress decreases** because you're not carrying the full burden of figuring everything out alone.

**Your learning accelerates** because you're constantly exposed to new ideas and approaches.

## The Universal Truth Behind Success 🌟

Throughout history, the most successful individuals, organizations, and civilizations have shared this common trait: they combined personal effort with openness to wisdom beyond their own understanding. This isn't about abandoning personal responsibility—it's about enhancing it with collective intelligence and adaptive flexibility.

Whether you're launching a business, raising children, pursuing health goals, or navigating career challenges, this principle remains constant: the best plans emerge when we balance personal initiative with humility and openness to greater wisdom.

## Your Next Steps Forward 🚶‍♀️

Starting tomorrow, choose one area of your life where you're currently planning or making decisions. Apply this approach:

1. **Acknowledge** what you don't know
2. **Seek** diverse perspectives
3. **Create** flexible plans with built-in adaptation points
4. **Remain** open to outcomes better than you originally imagined
5. **Trust** the process while staying actively engaged

Remember: this isn't about becoming passive or indecisive. It's about becoming strategically humble and collaboratively intelligent. The most powerful combination is personal commitment paired with wisdom that extends beyond your individual perspective.

The future belongs to those who can balance confidence with curiosity, planning with flexibility, and self-reliance with collaborative wisdom. Every successful plan begins not with knowing all the answers, but with trusting that the best answers will emerge through dedicated effort guided by wisdom greater than our own limited viewpoint.

Your dreams are too important to trust to your limitations alone. Open yourself to the abundant wisdom available around you, and watch your plans transform from mere hopes into inevitable realities. 🚀

First off: Am I the only one who thought all those “make money pushing buttons” TikToks were fake? Because SAME. But then—I found **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, and, just WOW. 

Here’s what’s totally wild about these app testing “gateways”:

- Many claim you get easy cash: Just *click, solve, $$*.
- You’re basically the “key” before someone gets to the REAL thing.
- The “test” is simply clicking CAPTCHAs, watching for bugs, and maybe rating the experience.
- All while promising “earn real money, instantly!” on sites like **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**.

HOW IS THIS EVEN LEGIT?

Meanwhile, you’re bombarded with more apps and more CAPTCHAs—one after the other. Wait, am I trapped in an endless loop of squiggly letters and traffic lights?

But then my SHOCK escalated. Because people are actually cashing out 💸. 

Wait, so let me get this straight… apps pay USERS to literally gatekeep their own app via CAPTCHAs? Is this the future of “app testing”? Do you get rich or just click yourself into insanity?

Here’s what floored me:
- Some folks genuinely *are* getting little payments sent to PayPal.
- Reviews (mixed but HYPED on coupons & testing subreddits?!) legit endorse **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
- It’s turning into a SIDE HUSTLE for people bored in lectures (guilty 😅) or wanting a “brain break”
- A few even claim: “My rent is COFFEE now, thanks **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**!”

AND YET, my paranoia is at max. The catch? 
- Some “app gateways” stall payout unless you reach a crunchy milestone promised like 10,000 clicks. UM, is this reward or a never-ending CAPTCHA black hole?
- You’re literally “beta testing” whether the CAPTCHAs WORK… which means, some contribute, some just fatten click farms somewhere.
- What about privacy?! How much of our clicky data is sent to the AI overlords? 😱

SO, I HAVE QUESTIONS:
- Would YOU keep clicking if it started burning time instead of making cents?
- Has anyone else hit a payout on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (don’t leave me hanging here)?
- Are these “gateways” real side hustles or do they cap out to keep the clicks flowing?

I am HYPED to see where all this AI-powered “earn for effort” micro-tasking goes next. CAPTCHAs are evolving, app testing is going spicy, and I’m seriously considering making a spreadsheet just to track the truth.

Until then: Is **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** the wild west of easy money or just another gig to fry our patience? Lmk your experiences, hacks, and “how much coffee per 50 CAPTCHAs” math below.

How to Flip a Pancake (Like a President)  

2. Objective and Audience  
Entertain and surprise a general audience with a funny, intimate kitchen moment, giving a mundane activity an oddly presidential twist. Appeals to fans of clever, chill humor and everyday relatability.  

3. Title and Run Time  
Obama Vlog – Pancake Diplomacy | 8 seconds  

4. Location and Set  
Family kitchen, softly lit morning light. Wholesome clutter: mixing bowls, coffee mug, a carton of eggs, and a sizzling griddle. One pancake mid-flip.  

5. Characters and Detailed Actions  
Obama stands in front of a skillet, spatula in hand, wearing a “Weekend Chef” apron over a rolled-up dress shirt. He looks at the camera, then down at the pancake. One smooth flip, then a chuckle.  

6. Visual Style  
Hyperrealistic: subtle steam rising off the griddle, soft kitchen tones with crisp lighting on Obama’s expressions. Feels candid but cinematic — like a memory in 4K.  

7. Audio (exact dialogue, tone, and timing)  
(0:00–0:02) Obama (casual, amused): “You ever notice… flipping pancakes is like international diplomacy?”  
(0:03–0:05) Obama (tilts head, flips): “Takes timing... steady hands… and if you mess up—”  
(0:06–0:08) Obama (grins, holds up mangled pancake): “Well, you better learn to love crispy edges.”  

8. Camera Motions and Angles  
Open on a medium shot, camera shoulder-height. Slow zoom-in as Obama flips the pancake. Subtle over-the-shoulder angle to catch the spatula action, then back to Obama’s expression as he delivers the punchline.
