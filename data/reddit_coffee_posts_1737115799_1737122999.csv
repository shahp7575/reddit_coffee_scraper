1i3h2i1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1i3h2i1/is_she_blowing_me_off/,Is she blowing me off?,"I've been trying to schedule a date with this girl I met over Instagram at college. We've had a good conversation, but since it was on Instagram she took a while to respond. She now has my number and uses that instead. 
Basically I asked if she was free this weekend to meet for coffee, but she said she goes home on weekends while I live full time on campus.
Then I told her to let me know when she's free, and she said ""I'm free pretty much during the week, but I work Tuesday-thursday tho"" and didn't give me any specific times.
Is she blowing me off, by not being specific and hoping I get confused and stop trying. Because she seemed interested because 1. She agreed for a meet up, 2. She was asking alot of questions about myself in our texts, 3. I gave her my number and she's now using it instead of socials.
Do I give up? There's a long weekend coming up and she's not gonna be back till Tuesday, in which she then has to work until Thursday, and might leave again on Friday. 
I'm sure there's a time early in the day we could meet up for a few hours or so, but she's not giving specifics, so is that a sign she's blowing me off. Or is this what playing hard to get is?
Either way I'm getting discouraged that she doesn't actually want to go out.",1,1737122741.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1i3h2d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1i3h2d2/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I am not really stable in this moment. Like my mood goes crazy up and down - currently down. (But in total I am fine, no worries. Just kinda upset?)

So, I finally got medication and it is methylphenidate retard. I tried taking 2-3x 10 mg in 1,5-2h ranges. E.g. 9am, 10:30am and maybe 12. And it was okay I guess? Last week or so my doctor told me I could take 20 & 10 instead. 

I took 20 mg today and I feel so uncomfortable. Is this mood rollercoaster even a thing? I wanted to be really productive, had a super short ""high"" and now I am really down and want to cry and am unable to focus on my university stuff which is urgent which does not help. My dr didn't even mention that this could happen and I don't know what is wrong? I mean, I took this dose before, just in two steps but those were really close, it shouldn't make a difference?

After reading a bit in a forum: 

I probably had the worst routine today: I did not feel like eating, so I skipped my breakfast and after still not being hungry at 11:20, I just took the 20 mg. 

Second severe mistake: I drank coffee AND coke, I was just so tired. I knew better but still did it. In the forum I read that I should not drink any coffein at all when I don't have my final dose and always always eat before taking it. 

Well, thanks for telling me all this mr. psychiatrist?

Those bad feelings feel like eternity already (3 pm where I live) and it's worse that I won't be able to work on my project today. Bye bye weekend which I really needed. 

What are your dosages and does anyone split methylphenidate retard into 3 intakes? 

Has anyone had side effects like this on such small dosages? What was the time period to find your dosage? 

Sorry for the long post, I know most of us are bad with long texts ❤️

1i3gzzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i3gzzh/from_dark_side_to_medium/,From Dark side to Medium.,"Hello guys!

I'm back here to talk about medium roast with the Sage Bambino Plus and Sage Smart Grinder Pro. I recently struggled A LOT to get a drinkable espresso. It ended up my issue was bean related or technical limitation as I can't increase water temperature on my machine to correctly brew medium roast.

As soon I changed to dark roast, my shots were not sour anymore. The thing is dark roast beans are too intense for me and I would love to go back with medium roast (without pulling sour shots tho). I heard medium beans usually need higher temperature to extract well and as I can't change this on my machine, I feel stuck with cheap beans (Lavazza, dark roast supermarket beans, 9/10 intensity).

There is nothing I can do with my grind size nornouck prep'. I tried everything, minimum size to coarser, a ratio from a classic 1:2 to lungo and more), moving from 17g to 23g IN. I tried pressurised basket, single backet, and of course, classic double basket.

The coffee I'm talking about don't have the roast date on is packaging. Therefore, I asked the shop because I know they roast the beans by themselves. I find out it was freshly roasted, 1 week ago-ish. However, it is not a speciality coffee, should I give a try to medium specialty coffee? am I trapped with dark roast with my actual setup?

Any recommendations? 😁",1,1737122533.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1i3gzjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1i3gzjh/translation_services/,Translation Services,"Let’s chat about the treasure hunt known as finding clients for language translation. It’s a wild ride that can feel more like searching for a needle in a haystack—or, in my case, trying to find my favorite sock after doing laundry.

First off, let’s talk platforms. ProZ.com is like the welcoming front porch of the translation world. Imagine it: a bustling exchange where language ninjas gather, showcasing their skills like they’re auditioning for the role of a lifetime. You can set up a profile with your linguistic expertise, demonstrate that you’re the go-to for translating poetry or technical manuals, and even share your past experiences like they’re war stories from the front lines of language warfare. 

Now, once you’ve set up shop, it’s all about visibility. You want to make sure your profile shines brighter than the flashiest neon sign in Vegas. Fill it with a few key details about your background, sprinkle in some testimonials—especially if you have clients who adored your work enough to write you a postcard from their last vacation—and showcase your specialty. This isn’t merely a resume; it’s your personal ‘call to action’. 

Next up, pricing. Ah, the holy grail of translation services! You want to strike that perfect balance between competitive and sustainable. Think of your pricing as a pizza: if you charge too much, your clients might think they could just make their own at home. If it's too low, they might wonder why you’re practically giving it away. Research what other translators in your niche are charging and find a sweet spot where your skills and financial needs intersect. And trust me, there’s nothing wrong with starting slightly lower to build a client base before you slowly rise like a doughy crust in a warm oven.

If you’re feeling extra adventurous—or perhaps a little cheeky—consider offering a discount for first-time clients. It's like saying, “Hey, come on in, the water is fine!” You’ll attract more bites, build trust, and if you do your job well, who knows? They might stick around even after the price goes back up. It’s a win-win, my friends!

Lastly, remember that it’s all about connection. Don’t just send out proposals into the abyss; build relationships! Engage with potential clients. Respond to queries, offer insights, and share your thoughts like you're sitting around a coffee table with friends. Connecting is the name of the game in our community. After all, translation isn’t just about words—it's about understanding cultures, emotions, and the stories behind them.

So, get out there, embrace the chaos, navigate the nuances, and remember that each client is a new chapter in your translation journey. Here’s to finding those clients, sharing your linguistic talents, and transforming language barriers into bridges! And if all else fails, there’s always a good dad joke waiting to lighten the mood.",1,1737122500.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

Also, I too needed advice from it so here I am.


**The 90/10 Principle**

Consider a situation: You're eating breakfast with your family. Your daughter accidentally knocks over a cup of coffee onto your business shirt. You curse and harshly scold your daughter for the mishap. She breaks down in tears.

After scolding her, you turn to your wife and criticize her for placing the cup too close to the edge of the table. A short verbal argument follows. You storm upstairs and change your shirt. Back downstairs, you find your daughter has been too busy crying to finish breakfast and get ready for school. She misses the bus. Your wife must leave immediately for work. You rush to the car and drive your daughter to school. Because you are late, you drive 80 km an hour in a 60 km/h speed limit zone. After a 15-minute delay and paying a $60 traffic fine, you arrive at school. Your daughter runs to the building without saying goodbye.

After arriving at the office 30 minutes late, you find you forgot your briefcase. Your day has started terribly, and as it continues, it seems to get worse and worse. You look forward to going home. When you arrive home, you find a small wedge in your relationship with your wife and daughter. Why? Because of how you reacted in the morning.

Why did you have a bad day?
A) Did the coffee cause it?
B)Did your daughter cause it?
C) Did the traffic policeman cause it?
D) Did you cause it?

The answer is D.

You had no control over what happened with the coffee. How you reacted in those 5 seconds is what caused your bad day. Here is what could have and should have happened:

Coffee splashes over you. Your daughter is about to cry. You gently say, ""It's OK honey, you just need to be more careful next time."" Grabbing a towel, you rush upstairs, change your shirt, and grab your briefcase. You come back down in time to look through the window and see your child getting on the bus. She turns and waves. You and your wife kiss before you both go to work. You arrive 5 minutes early and cheerfully greet the staff. Your boss comments on how good a day you are having.

Notice the difference. Two different scenarios. Both started the same but ended differently. Why? Because of how you REACTED. You really do not have any control over 10% of what happens. The other 90% is determined by your reaction.

Here are some ways to apply the 90/10 secret:

If someone says something negative about you, do not be a sponge. Let the attack roll off like water on glass. You don't have to let the negative comment affect you! React properly, and it will not ruin your day. A wrong reaction could result in losing a friend, being fired, getting stressed out, etc.

How do you react if someone cuts you off in traffic? Do you lose your temper? Pound the steering wheel? Curse? Does your blood pressure skyrocket? Do you try and bump them? WHO CARES if you arrive ten seconds later at work? Why let the blue car ruin your drive?

Remember the 90/10 principle, and do not worry about it! If you are told you lost your job, why lose sleep or get irritated? It will work out. Channel your energy and time into finding another job. If the plane is late, and it is going to mangle your schedule for the day, why vent your frustration on the flight attendant? She has no control over what is going on. Use your time to read, get to know the other passengers, etc. Why get stressed out? It will just make things worse. Now you know the 90/10 secret. 

Apply it, and you will be amazed at the results.
        

After reading this I had a question;But how do you not become a sponge though?I understand the whole concept very well.I always reflect on myself that if I don't react much it's not gonna impact others.But no matter what I try it's gonna make me feel bad.I'm the one who can't stop acting like a sponge.so what do I need to do to overcome it?As a person who keeps lingering on smallest of negative remarks for hours,what do I need to let go of my tendency to become sponge?",2,1737122326.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

I was going to take the plush to the dry cleaners but it would cost nearly the same amount that I bought the lion plush for. I cant afford that. I also can't afford to buy another one at the moment. I can't wash it myself because I have physical health problems. 

I'm debating weather to put on vinted for a cheaper price and explain that it needs a good wash or to bin it? (I really don't want to put it in the charity shop in that condition) please could I have some advice please?

Instead of daydreaming, my imagination follows my needs and business, and my mind seems to be sharper, better reflexes, I once caught a falling coffee cup mid air. Usual me is a stoner sloth.

1i3gt3t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i3gt3t,[F4M] A Mother’s Descent into Forbidden Desires - Son’s Friend/Bully ,"About me: Sakshi, 31 F Bengali

Themes of the play: Cheating, Cuckold, Exhibitionism, Corruption, Breeding.(more..)

Title: A Mother’s Descent into Forbidden Desires - Son’s Friend/Bully

**Act 1: The Ideal Family - The Picture of Perfection**  
Sakshi and Aakash were the quintessential couple, a perfect blend of tradition and modernity. Sakshi embodied the role of the sanskari Indian wife, always graceful, elegant, and effortlessly beautiful. She was also a devoted mother, having raised their son, Aryan, with the same values she lived by.

Life seemed perfect on the outside. But Sakshi was starting to feel the weight of monotony, the same routines, the same conversations, the same reserved intimacy with her husband. There was a part of her that longed for more, though she never dared to admit it.

Then came Aryan’s college years, and with them, a storm named Karan.

**Act 2: Enter Karan - The Predator’s Obsession Begins**  
Karan was Aryan’s college friend; a cocky, confident young man with a devil-may-care attitude. He wasn’t just popular; he was the alpha in his circle. But he also had a darker side, a bully who got what he wanted, no matter the cost.

One day, during a college event where parents were invited, Karan finally met Sakshi in person. He had seen her photos on Aryan’s Instagram before, the occasional family picture, Sakshi in elegant sarees or trendy salwar suits. She looked hot in those pictures, sure. But seeing her in the flesh? She was stunning. Her curves, her glowing skin, her effortless charm, none of the young girls at college could hold a candle to her.

The moment Karan laid eyes on Sakshi, something awakened in him. He didn’t just want her. He needed her. And Karan was never one to back down from a challenge.

**Act 3: The Games Begin - Flirting with Boundaries**  
Karan began showing up at Aryan’s house more frequently. Initially, it seemed innocent enough, just a friend hanging out. But Karan’s real motive was clear: he wanted to get closer to Sakshi.

Sakshi, ever the gracious host, welcomed him warmly. She was naturally easygoing and friendly, and Karan found it effortless to charm her. He’d throw in flirty, pervy comments disguised as jokes.

“You don’t look like a typical mom, Sakshi,” he’d say with a mischievous grin. “No wonder Aryan doesn’t post more pictures of you..he’s probably worried his friends will start crushing on you.”

Sakshi would laugh it off, thinking it was harmless banter. But deep down, she enjoyed the attention. It made her feel desired in a way she hadn’t felt in years.

**Act 4: The First few “Dates”**  
The flirtation escalated when Karan suggested a coffee outing. “Come on, Sakshi. Just a quick coffee. Aryan doesn’t need to know.”

She hesitated but eventually agreed. After all, what harm could a coffee date do?

That one coffee turned into multiple “dates” They’d explore new cafés, watch movies together, and even take long walks. Each time, Karan pushed the boundaries a little further..holding her hand, brushing her hair away from her face, complimenting her in ways no one else dared.

“You’re wasted on Aakash,” he said one day, his voice low and teasing. “He doesn’t know what he has.”

Sakshi’s heart raced at his words. She tried to push the guilt aside, but Karan’s charm was overwhelming.

**Act 5: The Birthday Party - The Night of No Return**  
When Karan invited Sakshi to his birthday party, she hesitated. But Aryan convinced her to go, saying it would be fun.

At the party, Karan treated Sakshi like his. He paraded her around, introducing her to his friends as if she were his date. And Sakshi didn’t mind. She liked the way he made her feel; desirable, sexy, alive.

As the night went on, Aryan left early, trusting Karan to drop his mom home.

The moment Aryan was gone, Karan’s demeanor changed. His playful charm turned into something darker, more dominant.

“You’re staying the night” he whispered, pressing her against the wall. “I’m done waiting!”

Sakshi tried to resist, but the passion between them ignited like wildfire. Karan didn’t hold back. He claimed her in every room of his apartment..the kitchen counter, the living room couch, even against the balcony railing. By the time they were done, Sakshi was a used, trembling mess, completely under Karan’s control.

The next morning, she slipped on one of Karan’s shirts to go home. Her dress lay torn on the floor. As she walked into her house, she was grateful that Aakash was at work and Aryan was still asleep.

**Act 6: The Transformation - From Wife to Slut**  
After that night, everything changed.

Karan awakened something in Sakshi; a wild, slutty side she never knew she had. Their dates became more daring. They’d make out in public parks, sneak away to motels, and even have sex in Karan’s car.

Karan loved showing her off. He’d take her to parties, introducing her to his friends as “my girl.” And Sakshi played along, enjoying the thrill of being desired by a younger man.

“You’re my slut now” Karan whispered one night, his hand gripping her throat as he took her from behind. “Say it!”

“I’m your slut Karan!” Sakshi gasped, her voice filled with lust.

**Act 7: Aryan’s Discovery - The Son Becomes an Accomplice**  
It wasn’t long before Aryan noticed the change in his mom. She seemed happier, more youthful. Her outfits became more daring. And Karan was always around.

One day, Aryan accidentally walked in on them..his mom being pounded by Karan on the living room couch!

Instead of being angry, Aryan was… intrigued.

“Mom, you look happier with him..” Aryan said later. “I’m not mad. If this is what you want, go for it.”

Aryan even helped cover for her, making excuses to Aakash and distracting him when needed.

**Act 8: The Fall of Aakash - The Cuckolding Begins**  
As Sakshi and Karan’s affair intensified, Aakash remained oblivious. But Karan wanted more.

“He’s holding you back,” Karan said. “You don’t need him. You have me.”

Sakshi found herself agreeing. The love she once felt for Aakash was gone, replaced by her insatiable lust for Karan.

One night, Karan took it a step further. He convinced Sakshi to invite Aakash to one of their parties, a party where Karan’s friends all knew her as his woman.

Aakash, clueless as ever, watched in confusion as his wife danced provocatively with Karan, her body pressed against his. By the end of the night, Aakash realized the truth. ( We can build this differently and as we like)

**Themes to Explore:**   
*Corruption and Seduction:* Karan’s relentless pursuit of Sakshi and her gradual descent into debauchery.

*Public Humiliation:* Karan showing off Sakshi as his prize in front of his friends.

*Cuckolding:* Aakash witnessing his wife’s transformation and being powerless to stop it.

*Mother-Son Bond:* Aryan supporting his mom’s newfound freedom, even encouraging her to live her best life.

Learn from my mistakes, before it's too late.","When the monster came tapping on my window, a sickening, familiar panic began to drip down the back of my throat. It settled in my empty stomach and lit every one of my nerves on fire.

I was foolish to believe that my nightmare was over, but I have to wake up eventually, right?

I had hoped, with every fiber of my being, that I was hallucinating, insane from grief.

That I couldn't be pregnant.

I wasn't a bad person.

And monsters weren't real.

Unfortunately, for me -- only one of those statements was true.

***

Nine months ago, I'd dug an old, nearly expired pregnancy test out of one of the cabinets in my bathroom, ""just to be sure"".

From the moment those two pink lines became visible, I wanted so fucking badly to believe that I was being handed the privilege of raising and nurturing a piece of my husband.

I wouldn't allow myself to recognize that the estimated time of conception didn't line up with the last time my husband and I were intimate in that way.

Or the way that his appearance had begun to change before he was out of the picture.

Color seemed to slowly drain from my husband, bit by bit with each passing day -- *easily* explained by his time spent indoors, away from the sunlight.

Being out of work must *surely* have been what was smoothing out the texture covering my husband's body. The difference was only noticeable because his had been exacerbated by years of hard, physical labor.

It made sense that the darkness my husband dwelt in caused his eyes to sink in -- irises round and dull, they were hardly visible around his equally round, dilated pupils.

And without reason to use his hands much, it was understandable that my husband's had reduced to short, blunt digits.

Excuses were easier than admitting that something was wrong. Changes are harder to notice when they happen to the person you spend so much of your time with, even if they're drastic.

As much as I hate myself for this: The more difficult it became to recognize my husband (once his appearance started to change), the easier it was for me to recall the similarities his features bore to the monster that stood outside my window.

***

That was the first night the monster came.

I sat up in bed after the faint sound of tapping roused me from my sleep. I instinctively reached toward the empty half of my bed as my eyes strained, trying to locate the source of the noise.

A ghastly shade of gray outside my bedroom window stuck out to me. I threw my glasses on.

Fuck.

My heart sank.

There was *something* lurking outside my bedroom window.

Fear, in a way I'd never felt before, crept its way in, cold and hollow in my chest. I was in no way prepared to handle a peeping tom, or any sort of home invasion. I mean, who really is? I had no weapon, no dogs, no protection, *nothing* to deter someone from attempting a break-in. 911 can only do so much with spotty service, and being 45 minutes away from the closest city.

I fumbled for my phone while continuing to peer out of the window -- the few inches that weren't covered by curtains. I could only distinctly make out a short, pale talon, and watched as it continued rapping against my bedroom window. The winter night was unforgiving; it cloaked whatever figure stood on the other side of my window in a deep, inky darkness, making it difficult to discern any features beyond the talons that tap, tap, tapped incessantly.

What do you DO in this situation?

Realistically, I had no options. Until an actual *threat* was posed, there was little more I could do but to continue staring.

So that's what I did. Wide and dry, I kept my eyes fixed on the talons that tapped on my window. It wasn't until brilliant sunlight suddenly stung my eyes -- beaming through the gap in my curtains -- that I realized I had dozed off. My memory of the previous night was still fresh in my mind; the anxiety that'd built up in my chest had yet to even dissipate.

It was all so... strange. Creepy. Unnerving. Calling the police may have been the right decision to make, because a pervert watching me sleep *was* the likely culprit. But what predator tracks down a home tucked away in the woods, just to stand outside and tap on their intended victim's bedroom window for several hours straight? What police department would take a complaint like that seriously?

Valid questions, but their answers do not matter. Not anymore, at least.

There was an instinct, a gut feeling I had that held me back from reacting to the monster outside my window.

Pinning the explanation for that gut-feeling on an imaginative product of stress and sleep deprivation was easy. It probably even made sense.

Unfortunately, nothing was going to have a chance to get better until I accepted the reality of my situation. But how can I be expected to accept something that shouldn't exist?

***

It was a monster.

Yes. A *real, living* monster.

If I opened my bedroom window, I'd be able to reach out and shake its disgustingly smooth hand. The cold wind would make my skin prickle as I'd stare directly into its depressingly lifeless eyes.

Thus began a nightly, torturous ritual.

Nine months.

275 nights.

I was losing my fucking mind.

Who wouldn't?

And where panic increased linearly, contempt grew exponentially alongside of it. I hated myself. I hated the monster outside my window.

Most of all, I hated whatever the fuck the monster had put in my body. It kicked and writhed and made me miserable. The shapes that pressed against my belly with every blow were something unnatural that made me sick.

I was scared, okay? My life is more important than an unwanted, alien fetus, and I am not a bad person for prioritizing myself. *Nobody* is a bad person for that.

Whatever I was incubating was largely to blame for the way that I fell apart. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't take care of myself.

How can you eat or drink when anxiety is the only thing your body will let you swallow?

How can you take your meds when you can't even brush your teeth, let alone be bothered to refill your prescriptions?

How do you cope with your life -- that was already fucking shitty -- when what should be impossible drags you deeper and deeper into madness?

How can you stand to be completely isolated, with nothing to distract you from the scary fucking monster that nobody would fucking believe, because it shouldn't be fucking *real*?

The honest answer?

I can't.

I *don't*.

***

I only woke up to blinding sunlight on the first night the monster visited. It was the only time I dozed off in that way, and the only time I stared at the monster for longer than 10 minutes.

Like a goddamn 5 year old, when I can't stand it anymore, I pull the covers over my head. I keep my eyes closed but never really fall asleep. When the sun is bright enough to shine through my blanket, I know it is safe to look again.

Looking at the monster outside my window *never* got easier to stomach. Like a car crash, though, I couldn't look away. Not until the panic overrode my system.

Slowly worming their way out of impossibly black shadows, details of the monster's frame became more apparent as time passed. It felt calculated, because I wasn't attempting to analyze the monster -- I could hardly stand to fucking look at it. *It* was intentionally revealing these small traits, giving me the parts to a machine without the instructional manual.

Wickedly colorless, the monster's skin was the same pale shade of gray as its talons, a stark contrast against every starless night sky it stood under. *Fur(?)* of some sort sprouted from its head and face in an unrecognizable pattern. Dark, dull eyes, devoid of life, stared straight through me -- the monster's expression never changing. Its pupils were so large and round it's as if they devoured the irises entirely.

Believe me when I say, friends, that I would've preferred sorrow to completely consume me, swallow me whole, and spit out the ""monster"" as a hallucination -- a manifestation of misery -- than to *ever* accept that a physical monster was what stood outside my window, tapping and whispering every night.

Yes. The monster began to whisper, too. Unintelligible words, softly articulated, filtering through the window as if carried on a breeze.

The monster's voice was mythical, like that of a Siren's -- tempting, luring me in with melodies full of promise. *Waiting* for me to climb ashore and sign my own death certificate.

And I was the crew member that'd been left to die in the wreckage of my ship, swimming desperately toward the Siren's euphonious ballad. Oblivious to the monster that was hiding underneath its skin.

If Sirens were real, I'd have been able to crawl out of my bedroom window and be met with an unbelievable, unimaginable atrocity, beyond the scope of anything a normal brain could process. Before having the opportunity to sense the danger I was in, I'd have already been dead.

The monster would've picked me right up and tore me limb from limb, savoring its meal as I bled out on the ground. I'd have been given the mercy of death, and my last conscious thoughts would've been filled with hope and desire.

Sirens are a fairytale. The monster outside my window is both halves of the Brothers Grimm. 

***

I've skirted around the topic long enough. My husband passed from a sudden cardiac event roughly 3 months before I discovered that I was pregnant.

3 months before the monster came to visit.

My husband was (and still is), from the bottom of my broken heart, my entire world. My person. More than words could ever express. He was love, warmth, *home* incarnate. Six years was not enough time. A *lifespan* wouldn't have been enough time.

I'd never imagined a future without my husband in it. How could I? Even after our mortal bodies passed, I truly pictured our souls bound to an eternity together -- an eternity of raw, wholesome love. Our words, delicate and tender, floating through time and space. A cadence not unlike the whispers that come from the monster outside my window.

***

While I did my best, I can admit that my husband deserved better.

The guilt (as you can imagine) will haunt me indefinitely. I will spend every fucking second of every goddamn day wondering how different things would have been if I'd noticed the way he was changing. *How* could I not recognize what was happening to my better half?

I know what you're thinking.

My husband was never a monster. He was full of love and warmth until the moment his heart stopped, and my love for him never wavered. I don't know what caused his changes, and it wouldn't matter if I did. My husband was different, but he was *never* a monster.

***

Time was ticking for the creature growing in my belly; I had to accept and face what was happening.

It was no coincidence that a monster came to my window the very night I found out I was pregnant.

It was no coincidence that the creature growing in my belly felt more and more alien, in tandem with the intensity of the monster's nightly visits.

I can acknowledge that my husband's condition resembled the monster outside my window, but I cannot stress enough:

**My husband was never a monster.**

The thing about the monster, though? The overarching question of *why* the abomination outside my window had initially been given that title?

The monster IS alien. Not from outer space; its features are just grotesquely... unique. In the most unsettling way.

The monster incites such an intense fear because it is unknown. And how has history treated the unknown?

***

The night before I went into labor, the monster once again came tapping. Over time, with every visit, its volume slowly rose from gentle whispers, growing louder and louder. More urgent. Making it harder and harder to muffle.

You have to understand -- I *had* to protect myself in some way. I don't care if pulling the covers over my head was childish. I don't care if doing everything shy of killing myself was immoral. Somewhere in the storm, I had to figure out how to keep my sanity anchored. I had to find what I could control.

I tried to be brave.

I tried to stay confident.

I tried to remain strong.

I tried.

I tried.

*I tried.* 

That night, I couldn't take it anymore. Trying was pointless.

I knew I would go into labor any day, and gauged that it would be safe if I just pressed my ear to my bedroom window. To *finally* listen to what the monster had been saying. I couldn't imagine it would recite everything it's uttered over the last nine months in a single night, but I had a feeling it would know I was listening this time.

Getting out of bed, I knelt by the window and carefully pulled the curtain aside, just enough to press my ear against the cold, damp glass.

A deep, booming voice, *seething,* almost vibrating in my skull, spoke,

*Abominations are born from me, and to me they will return.*

*Murder, sickness, suicide, accidents... they always find their way back home.*

*Children are not a consequence of your actions. **My** children, my **abominations** bear that burden.*

*Over and over, your kind fail my children. I give my strongest to your weakest, and you still fail. My children will return to me, flesh or spirit, but you will not be absolved of your negligence.*

*Why do I send my children to their death or great harm? They are different from you in ways you wouldn't understand or believe.*

*My children will be fine. The wicked hearts I send them to, will not.*

*Wicked Hearts deserve misfortune. Losing your husband, your sanity, everything but your **life**, was nothing compared to the fate you truly deserved*

*For nine months, I whispered from the other side of your window.*

*How ironic, that the only way you chose to ""protect"" yourself, was by ignoring all that you'd need to know to make your burden your gift.*

*What was the big secret? The answers you were **so** curious about, but were too cowardly to listen to? What message could the monster outside your window want to convey?*

*You won't like it. Wicked Hearts never do.*

*I told you **everything** you would ever need to know to take care of the daughter I sent you.*

*Her anatomy, her expected development, what she ate, the conditions she would thrive under, the differences between your heart and hers, and how you could grow from that.*

*What did you do?*

*You childishly covered your ears.*

*You starved yourself, refused necessary medical care, stopped taking your prescribed medication, and physically hurt yourself in an effort to miscarry.*

*You call that ""brave""?*

*You call that ""confident""?*

*YOU CALL THAT ""**STRONG**?""*

The monster then mocked me:

*""But what was I supposed to believe with an abomination lurking outside my window every night?""*

*""How could you expect me to believe a hideous, unknown creature was anything but evil?""*

*""There was something foreign growing inside of me; how can you blame me for protecting myself, fearing that it would take my life?""*

I didn't have an answer, but the monster didn't wait for one.

*Your heart has always been wicked. My son, your ""husband"", returned to me once that became apparent.*

*That's why I sent you **my** child, **my** abomination, **my** daughter -- to be **your** burden.*

*I knew what you would do with her. It's what all Wicked Hearts have done.*

*Do not get my words twisted. Termination is not murder. A **good-hearted** mother's life should always come first.*

*You may think I'm cruel -- that **my** heart is wicked -- for destroying your life in the way that I have.*

*Justify that however you would like. You are delusional, and your behavior is predictable.*

*The day a Wicked Heart sees a stranger instead of a monster,*

*Guidance instead of damnation,*

*Gratefulness instead of revulsion,*

*A bestowal instead of a burden,*

*Is the day I'll consider that Wicked Hearts can change.*

*Until then, they'll get what they deserve.*

*For 275 days, I tapped and tapped on your window, drawing your attention, revealing myself piece-by-piece through the gap in your curtains.*

*Slowly. Intentionally.*

*Waiting for the day your resolve would slip and you would come to me.*

*Waiting for the day you would throw the curtains aside to look directly at me, to satisfy your curiosity of wanting to know what your daughter will look like.*

*Waiting for the day you would murder her.*

*You will be going into labor tomorrow. I will be watching.*

***

The monster's words had barely ceased before the clock on my nightstand clicked over to midnight. I turned my head to get one last glimpse of the monster, only to be met with a pair of unnervingly deep, dark eyes, inches from mine on the other side of the glass.

A scream escaping my throat and an indescribable pain erupting in my midsection were the last things I remembered before my vision went black.

***

I woke up in a hospital bed, disoriented and in pain. My brain *throbbed* as it became flooded with... everything.

There was a sort of ""aura"" I felt that I couldn't describe, though; it evoked an eerie degree of calmness that somehow held me together. It freaked me out, but absorbed the panic before it could melt into my nerves.

Instinctually, I placed a hand over my stomach in an effort to ground myself and control the pain I was in.

It was flat.

My monster was gone.

Before I could compartmentalize anything that I was taking in, a woman dressed in blue scrubs entered my room.

""Hello, my name is Jamie and I'm a nurse-practitioner,"" she spoke from just inside the doorway, almost robotically. The sight of someone normal, speaking normally, knocked the air right out of my lungs.

*How did she know I'd just woken up?*

""I stopped by to let you know that the doctor will be with you shortly,"" the nurse finished.

I gestured vaguely toward my empty stomach, unable to form words. The concern etched into my face was palpable.

I expected Jamie to turn on her claws and scamper away the moment she was done talking, but surprisingly, she didn't. Instead, the nurse hesitated -- a look on her face that can only mean bad news is coming.

""I'll go get it,"" Jamie said reluctantly, harshly whipping her tail as she turned to walk away.

*It?*

I took a closer look at myself and my surroundings after the nurse left the room, trying desperately to absorb the stillness that the hospital was providing. Objectively, everything was ""normal"", in the sense that the shapes and colors were correct. But something was ""off"" in that the arrangement of them wasn't quite right.

The silence was becoming nerve-wracking. The longer I sat, the worse it felt.

I caught a glimpse of some faces as they walked past my room. Their expressions worried, passersby quickened their pace and averted their eyes.

My mind was reeling. So many thoughts, so many questions. Keeping in everything I've gone through these last nine months was smothering me.

275 days of solitude. The rest of the world could have burned to ashes and me -- isolated in my cabin in the woods -- would have been none the wiser.

But the world hadn't burned to ashes. The grass was still green and the sky was still blue. Taking a glance out the window, I could see that crunchy leaves littered the sidewalk, while shades of orange and red danced together in the wind.

I hadn't felt a breeze in so long. I bet the autumn air was crisp and refreshing. My body was probably relieved to be breathing anything other than stale cabin air.

The view should have been breathtaking, but my senses were overloaded. There were too many lights, too many colors; the barren tree branches pecking against my room's window bore a nauseating resemblance to the monster I've been haunted by. I quickly looked away, wishing I had a blanket thick enough to shield me.

The lack of postnatal care was beginning to put me on-edge. Why was I still alone? Why was it so quiet? Shouldn't I be feeding whatever I gave birth to? How much time had passed since I'd given birth? *Where was the fucking nurse that should be bringing me my baby?*

*Baby?*

I sat with my thoughts, making friends with the flickering fluorescent lights overhead. The more that time passed, the closer their humming sounded to faint whispers.

Can you imagine what I was going through in this moment? Nine months of completely secluded torture, waking up in an unfamiliar space with no memory of getting there? No answers, forced to sit in agonizing silence when you want to scream at the top of your fucking lungs and rip your scutes out in a fit of rage? Forced to sit still while your body processes everything you denied to give it for the past 275 days?

***

Time isn't real. I can't say how much passed before a different woman entered my room, cradling something small, silent, and unmoving in her arms; it was wrapped loosely with a blanket that was entirely too large for it.

*Is that what came out of me?*

""My name is Doctor Howell,"" the woman spoke. ""You must be Ms. Farley. Can you tell me your date of birth, please?""

The way my brain stuttered before mumbling the correct numbers felt alarming.

""Is... that my..."" I croaked, unable to finish my sentence. Sweat began to bead on my forehead. I hardly recognized my own voice.

""We need to talk about that,"" Dr. Howell replied, her face bearing a familiar mask of hesitancy.

As she started toward me, she continued, ""I know you must feel very overwhelmed right now.""

She bent down and handed me the bundle from her arms. The fabric was soft and warm. I kept my eyes locked on Dr. Howell's; despite my frustration, I wasn't ready to look.

""I have so many questions,"" I replied weakly, my lower lip quivering.

""I'll do my best to answer what I can,"" said Dr. Howell. ""It's going to be hard, but I need you to take a look at the... child, for lack of a more accurate term, I've handed you.""

I took a deep breath.

I'd held onto the hope that I was insane and this was all a nightmare. That I'd be ""pregnant"" forever, stuck in a layer of the afterlife, somewhere between limbo and hell. I couldn't believe that the time had come for me to look at the creature that had been growing in my belly.

I closed my eyes, tilted my head down, and opened them.

A scream clawed its way up my throat. It took every ounce of my willpower to choke it back down.

The thing I was looking at was not conceivable. The pieces of the puzzle the monster outside my window had been giving me were finally coming together. The creature in my arms was the picture on the box.

Tears sprang forth immediately.

I ran a webbed hand over impossibly smooth skin. Skin so pale it was almost reflective. 

Glancing at the scales on my arms, I revered in the way they shimmered under the room's lights. A reminder that I was right to be disturbed by the creature that I was holding.

The monster. *My* monster.

I held the hand of my monster, feeling its short, detached talons. 5 on each hand. I recognized them as the shapes that had pressed against my belly while I was still pregnant.

My monster was so still. So unnaturally quiet. Its eyes weren't open yet, so I pulled up one of its eyelids to look at the shape and color of them.

Steely-blue, dark and round, my monster's eye gazed upward into nothingness.

Our eyes are never that dark. Our pupils are never that round. Green, orange, or yellow, our irises take up the entirety of our eyes. With slits for pupils, they shine and allow us to expertly see in the dark. Something monsters shouldn't be able to do.

The contrast between our eyes and those of monsters made my stomach churn.

*It wasn't. Fucking. Right.*

I opened my monster's mouth. It had no teeth, and its tongue was fully intact. I ran a forked tongue over my own sharp canines, my mind breaking down with every infeasible characteristic it tried to process.

Something fine and wispy sat atop my monster's head. It was soft and sparse. I had to feel the serrated texture of my own head to remind myself I wasn't crazy. This wasn't normal. *I wasn't a bad person for putting myself first.*

The sun was setting outside the window in my hospital room, casting beautiful shades of gold across the sky. It felt like years had passed when Dr. Howell spoke again.

""The thing you're holding is unlike anything *anyone* has ever seen before,"" she started.

""But I'm sure you know that, Ms. Farley.""

""Where am I even at? How did anybody know where I lived, or that I was going into labor?"" I asked.

""To the best of my knowledge, a 911 call was placed from your home, describing your condition. Your location was then tracked by dispatchers, and you were taken by ambulance to here,"" Dr. Howell replied.

""Do you know how long I've been here, or when this monster-

""Creature -- I meant to say -- was born?"" I inquired.

Dr. Howell looked so tired as she responded,

""You gave birth roughly 18 hours ago. Even after the best numbing agents we have, nothing was helping your pain. The only thing we could do was sedate you, to ensure yours and your offspring's health was prioritized.

""Staff assisting the delivery were growing increasingly disturbed and ill -- a few had to leave the room.

""To be completely honest, Ms. Farley, we were speechless. We were in no way prepared to see a creature such as the one in your arms. It defies all manners of biology that we thought we'd figured out.

""I wish I had more answers, Ms. Farley. After birth, we took the creature to another room to stay warm, but it *still* has yet to make a peep. Were it not for it breathing, you could tell me that creature was a stillbirth and I would believe you.

""The more time that passes, the more needs this creature is going to have. What those are, or how to meet them, we don't know. The creature is going to suffer, if it hasn't already begun to.

""I fear you're going to have to make a choice, Ms. Farley,"" Dr. Howell then said.

Gooseflesh broke out underneath my scales as a chill trickled down my spine. I had the distinct feeling -- the same feeling that's haunted me for nine months -- that I was being watched. I glanced over my left shoulder.

No.

*No* 

Outside my hospital window, I could see the unmistakable outline of someone's head and shoulders.

Not someone.

Some *thing.*

The monster.

***

Maybe if I shrieked until my voice gave out and started breaking shit, they'd lock me away in a place with no windows, where the monster couldn't stalk me anymore.

There's just no way it followed me. There's *no* *fucking* *way.*

I turned my head away from the window and fought back more tears. Nothing felt real.

Dr. Howell studied my face while I tried to keep it as composed as possible. I knew what my ""choices"" were. There was only one.

I wasn't proud of the decision I was forced to make regarding my monster; it made me sick to my stomach. Simply put, I didn't know what *any* of its basic needs were, and even if I did, I was in no way equipped to meet them. I was completely unprepared to take care of something that'd never been known to exist before.

Unable to give the quality of life that my monster would've deserved, the morally responsible decision was to terminate post-birth, which medical staff encouraged. I was told it was quick and painless, although it doesn't ease my remorse. It eats me alive.

As horrible as my monster was, motherly love poured from my heart and seeped into my bones -- a maternal instinct that my 6-pound abomination couldn't change.

***

I came home from the hospital today. As guilty as I felt arriving empty handed, a selfish wave of relief washed over me, thinking that the visits from the monster were over. That I could grieve, sleep, and climb out of the dark hole I'd fallen into, without that creature dragging me back down.

*Tap.*

*Tap.*

*Tap.*

My eyes widened.

The familiar panic was fresh and frigid.

*The nightmare was never going to end.*

I snapped my head toward the window.

There it was. *There it fucking was.*

Fury replaced fear. I should've just closed the curtains when I returned home from the hospital. Fuck, I should've closed them after the first time I saw the monster. Closed my eyes and ears with it on that first night, and pretended it wasn't there.

It wasn't that easy. The sadistic piece of shit creeping outside my window every night knew how to manipulate my senses to keep me in its grasp. To control me. It mouthed off on its soapbox, pinning *me* as a monster, as if it were the pillar of morality.

There was nothing morally superior in any part of that freak.

All I did was love my husband. I didn't seek medical help for him when his appearance began to change. He passed unexpectedly from something I had no way to prevent.

That makes my heart wicked? What did I do -- at what point did my beloved husband ""realize"" my heart was wicked?

What power does the omnipresent monster outside my window possess, to know exactly whose heart is wicked? How does it even determine ""wickedness""? Why does it go through so many hoops to *abuse* people it deems wicked?

Why.

*Why?*

**WHY?**

I yanked the covers off, ready to give the nightmare outside my window exactly what it wanted.

Its features were crystal clear this time; I knew they would be. It wasn't possible to see its entire form through the small gap between the curtains, but I was sure it was smiling.

Smug piece of shit.

I stormed -- no, *stomped* my way over to my bedroom window. Every thud landing with as much anger and strength that I could muster in my fragile state.

""You didn't give me a chance to talk back last time,"" I said between the gap, a smile of my own stretching ear to ear.

""Not so big and tough when your punishment doesn't pay off, huh?

""Freak of nature ruining good people's lives because your fabricated narrative of good vs. bad is completely skewed from *my* reality.

""It was kill the thing or let it suffer. I couldn't give it what it needed. *Nobody* could. You're insane if you think suffering was the right choice for it. And you're insane for thinking a person would listen to -- let alone *believe* -- something as evil and vile as you.

""In my world, *you* have a wicked heart.

""*You* are the monster.

""You? Are everything you've crucified wicked hearts for.

""But you knew all of that already. You always fucking know.

""Get whatever the fuck you want to do with me out of your system and let me keep the sliver of life I have left.""

The monster was silent. Of course it was.

But I knew it was still smiling.

I couldn't take it anymore.

In one dramatic rip, I tore the curtains down and glared straight into the eyes of the monster outside my window.

Just like it wanted me to.

A wave of hysteria tried like hell to overtake me, but the pieces of the monster that had already been revealed to me over time held it back.

The sound of something wet or sticky, writhing and squelching like a bucket of worms, cut through the stillness and broke my gaze from the monster's eyes.

Below its waist, undulating tendrils snaked their way around the lower half of the monster's body, slimy and black.

*WHAT THE FUCK?*

Legs.

If you can call them that.

I was looking below-the-waist of the monster -- the parts that weren't visible from its usual stance outside my window. The parts that were concealed beneath the blanket my monster was wrapped in at the hospital.

There was something stationary in the viscous sea of appendages.

*Multiple* somethings.

Children.

Children that couldn't have been older than 5 or 6 surrounded the monster. All had extreme, visible trauma, including exposed brains, protruding bones with thin layers of skin covering them, deep, long scars and open wounds across their bodies, missing limbs and other injuries too heinous to describe.

How could anyone -- any *thing* -- be able to stomach sending their *children* to a fate like those? How severe is the abuse the monster's children suffered to have accumulated those kinds of wounds?

The monster outside my window remained wordless as I took in the harrowing scene.

Then I saw it.

Saw *her.*

My monster.

Though I only saw her briefly, bundled up in that soft blanket, I recognized her steely-blue eye. The same one I looked at in the hospital before she was terminated.

Detached from her skull, dangling by a meaty string, was her other eye. My monster was little more than a skeleton, her freakishly smooth skin stretched taut over her bones.

Bones that were brittle and broken.

Skin that gleamed silver under the moonlight.

The stars were out tonight.

My monster had deep lacerations on most of her body, slowly oozing a thick, red liquid. Barely detectable, I could see that she was shaking and twitching.

*Did I do this to my monster?*

*Was this the result of neglect during pregnancy -- what the monster outside my window accused me of?*

No.

My monster was perfect at birth. There wasn't anything wrong with her. She died quickly and painlessly.

***

Looking back, from the time I woke up in the hospital to the time I was discharged, everything went *too* smoothly. There was no outrage or panic. No fear or overt urgency. I was given space and time to process things as they unfolded. I was blanketed in that chilling serenity.

Dr. Howell knew exactly what to say, as if she'd spoke it many times before. The first nurse that checked on me, and the people I saw walk past my room, exuded just enough unease to incite alarm in me as I watched them.

So that I wouldn't *really* question them.

Dr. Howell had lied when she said that my child was unlike anything she'd ever seen.

Which means she probably lied about the pain, too.

***

Time was frozen, icicles chasing me through the rabbit hole I was spiraling down.

My heart pined in a depressing way. Regret, already intense, fused with the rage that was pulsing in my veins. My false bravado faltered as tears gathered in my eyes, stinging as they spilled onto my cheeks.

I was on the brink of collapsing when it dawned on me. When I finally put the fucking pieces together.

How would the graveyard outside my window bear such extreme trauma to their bodies, if they were terminated after birth, like my daughter?

*Daughter.*

The monster doesn't keep its children once they return from their death sentence.

It does something truly monstrous -- something more deserving of that title than my subjective perception.

The monster recycles its children.

***

""Recycling"" is the best way I can think to describe what the monster outside my window is doing with its children.

Over and over, the monster sends them to whoever it deems has a ""wicked heart"".

While all come out unscathed after birth, the monster's children are mutilated in that hospital before being terminated. Every wound from every termination accumulates.

The monster *wants* ""wicked hearts"" to believe its children's' injuries are a reflection of what they'd sustained in-utero.

The monster then ages its children in a way that exaggerates those injuries, to induce as much guilt as possible when it brings them for its sick show-and-tell.

How fucked up is that?

How *evil* is that?

I know what you're thinking.

That the monster is right, I'm making this up to deflect blame, I caused all of this, I deserve it, blah, blah, blah.

*I* am not evil.

My husband? The sweet man the *real* monster supposedly sent me? Where did he go? I don't recognize his face anywhere outside my window. How do I know the monster didn't drain and murder him on purpose, then lie about his ""return"" to further guilt me?

Because my husband was never a monster.

*I AM NOT A FUCKING MONSTER.*

***

I don't know how long I stood, transfixed, before a mirthless laugh brought me out of my pensiveness.

I once again fixed my eyes on the monster.

It didn't take long for it to speak, reigniting that spark of hatred within me.

*No emotion you fill yourself with will defy the atrocities you've committed.*

*Try as you might to convince yourself that I am evil and your heart is not wicked -- the torment you've experienced is a reflection of that.*

*It will haunt you for the rest of your days.*

*And you deserve every bit of it.*

The monster outside my window broke into that shit-eating grin, revealing two perfect rows of straight, flat, pearly white teeth.

My body was ablaze.

It was time to end this fucking nightmare.

Before I fed myself to the wolves, I spoke up one last time,

""If you were in my shoes,

""If you'd have been there,

""If you'd have *witnessed* it from my perspective,

""You would have done the same.""

The monster's expression never changed, and my blood was still boiling.

Without thinking twice, I opened the window and stumbled out toward the monster. My bare claws sunk into the mud and brambles were catching in my scales as I approached it.

The monster stood further back than normal in order for his legs and children to be visible through my window. I closed maybe half of the distance before a mucky tendril snatched me up and pulled me nose to nose with the monster.

It spoke:

*You see a monster.*

*I see humanity.*

Another tendril forced my mouth open.

The monster purged a foul, black sludge, and pushed every drop of it down my throat.

I wanted to gag and spit it back up, but I couldn't. The monster kept me in its tight grasp as the sludge dispersed throughout my body. It wasn't until it fully sank in that I was released.

Everything went black before I'd even hit the dirt.

***

I woke up back in my bed.

Sunlight beamed beautifully through my window -- a sight I wasn't sure I'd ever find comforting again. My blankets were soft and warm. The smell of coffee permeated the air and I could hear pots and pans tinkering in the kitchen.

My belly was full. My medications were back on my bedside table. Beside them was a card -- an appointment reminder with my primary care. Scars, chips, and burns to my scales were completely healed.

It's as if the monster outside my window really *was* a nightmare and I had finally woken up. That time had turned back or I was sent to a universe where my husband never passed away.

I took a deep breath and pulled my covers off, excited but nervous to walk into the kitchen and be reunited with my soulmate.

Something clattered to the ground as I stood. Startled, I bent over to pick it up.

Shimmering in the sunlight, I held between my fingers one of my scales. No longer its usual vibrant blue, my scale shone a colorless silver.

I cracked my bedroom window open and tossed my scale onto the grass.

Out of sight, out of mind.

1i3gpsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i3gpsk/my_dad_is_a_hoarder/,My dad is a hoarder,"This post is gonna be really long since I'm a yapper. I (19F) am in community college and live with my parents. I understand that to some, this is a privilege that some do not get to experience. I don't pay rent, my mom (47F) pays for my insurance and bills. I live rent free. My only fiscal responsibilities are to pay my tuition, doctor appts, and I bought my car and pay for gas. 

This post is directed a little at my dad (47M). For a majority of my childhood, he was on drugs, violent, and sleeping all the time. It was also my older brother's (24M now, but maybe 10M at the time) to keep the house clean. When I got a little older, we'd split some of the chores. For instance, ending every meal, one of us would put away dishes and clean the table, and the other would wash the new dirty dishes. 

In my brother's senior year of high school he got burnt OUT. He was in IB, had a part time job, was in band, and was now taking care of my infant brother. And ofc still cleaning the house. He ended up failing Calc 2 and didn't graduate with his IB diploma.

I don't recall how things were when he first went to university, so I'll fast forward a few years to COVID.

I was 14 during quarantine, freshie in HS. When remote classes started, my dad would leave the house for hours at a time, leaving me to look after my 2yo brother. I would ask when he'd come home, and he'd get pissed, saying he didn't have to tell me anything. He'd also turn off his location when he was out.

When he was home, he was asleep, or cooking, and he always claimed that he can't cook while watching my younger brother. Meanwhile, I was unable to attend classes, do homework, nor was I taking care of myself. 

This got even worse when I turned 16. He was heaaavily on drugs (xanax, ambien, crack, the works!) and would leave me alone with my brother more. I remember waking up one morning to my dad screaming at my younger brother to shut up, who was 4 and now diagnosed with ASD. I went out to the kitchen and even though I had washed the dishes at midnight, the sink was full of trash and dirty dishes. And coffee grounds all over the counter.

I only had my permit, so I'd offer to drive my brother and I to our schools, he'd say he was too tired. Bruh. I got my brother and I ready. I am driving. All you have to do is get in the car, and drive home in about 30 minutes. I had about 50 absences that year. Once I got home, he'd also sleep. Just sleep for three days straight then be awake for four days straight. 

Now, I'm in college and hold down a job. I'll be the first to admit, I've been slacking more around the house, but if I notice something and have the time to fix/clean it I do it. But my dad's picked up hoarding! He dumpster dives, picks up furniture from the curb, but does not get rid of any of the furniture we already have. He sleeps separately from my mom and in his room, you couldn't even open the door fully. So he took it upon himself to clean his room. He put everything in the living room. 

For about a week now, he's had stuff piling in the living room. A trash bag full of clothes, next to a shopping cart also full of clothes. Bedsheets, speakers, random tools stuffed into cardboard boxes. When I got home late last night, the boxes piled up even higher, there was rice all over the counter from my younger brother. There was trash all over the dining room table, and half-eaten food.

I took it upon myself by consolidating some of the items from Amazon into one, big box. I did this before btw! And he appreciated it! My boyfriend was there (21M). We were planning on going to the gym. I saw the trash and told him he should go home instead. He insisted on starting to clean with me, getting the bags of trash I was getting and bringing it to the bins outside. I tried to convince my dad to throw away two items. He refused, saying that he'd clean our garage tomorrow. He did not apologize for his mess, nor did he thank me for trying to help. He went to his room and periodically would come out to show my boyfriend something. 

My mom isn't innocent either! She likes to pretend she's a clean person but she's not, and I think she has a bit of a scarcity complex. To an extent, I believe she deserves it too! She's the reason we have a house, after all. As I was cleaning last night, I found stacks and stacks of shoe boxes of all these pairs she's impulse bought. There are purses on every couch, chair, and bed in this house. Her closet is full of purses too! My boyfriend admitted he was so surprised how much of it was hers. Luckily, she threw out most of the 15 year old shoes in our shoe closet. It's now full of shoe boxes. 

Anyway, this morning I checked my phone because I KNEW my dad was annoyed that I tried cleaning and I was CORRECT! He said it was the first and last time I'd throw away his shit (I only threw away literal garbage) and that he cleans up after everyone and that's why his stuff is so messy. And that I'm so disrespectful and I need to remember who I'm dealing with. 

I'm just so burnt out from it. I fantasize about moving out all the time and I can't afford it. I've considered staying with my brother before, since he moved out, but he lives so far from all of my friends. I want to rat my dad out to his germaphobe mom soo badly. I know she'll yell at him but it won't do me any good lol. I'm just so sick of it all. ",1,1737121692.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1i3gnfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i3gnfa/hr_i_died_in_the_house_with_the_ivy_wall/,[HR] I Died in the House with the Ivy Wall," **Chapter One:**

***The House with the Ivy Wall***

There are some quiet moments; some nights when crickets buzz broken chords, and the crawl of ivy vines grows to nothing. There are some quiet moments; moments when the hearth’s crackle burns cold, and the footsteps made by no one fall silent. There are nights, when the creaking of floorboards groan to themselves --and old men draw their last breaths-- and there are some quiet nights, when death does not come for all, not in the house with the ivy wall. It was a chilly night, when that tired old man died; finally falling to sleep, never to wake, that unforgiving place, resilient against the pains of the world, and fathoming the unfathomable. And when that old man at last consigned to rest, it was that house, that soon did call, when he awoke to find himself, in the house with the ivy wall.

It was not some matter of malice that drove one Doctor Thomas Lowrey, to misadventure onto the property. No instead it was his own pride, which laid the very foundation of his notion for expanse into the abyss. Thomas’s left pocket carried a small black bible. It is in the very first pages of this book that reads, *Evening came, and morning followed,* but Thomas would not become the first in history to find the oversimplification in these pages. No, in the ivy-walled house morning would not follow, but all the horrors in between. Night would follow, and for some, morning would never come. The gates that surrounded the house employed a similar technique to that of barbed wire, or spikes around trenching. In hope of driving off unwanted guests,’ black stains and rusted spikes drove down the property, forming some kind of fence, not from God.

It is the opinion of many a scholar, that the property was built as a home for orphaned youth, though no records were kept, and no one can attest to its history. In its early years, it suffered the bombings, barely so due to its distance from London. Many would tell you under the right moon, and the right clouds in the sky, one could still hear the sirens screech their siren songs, and one could still feel the gentle rumble of the falling evil that seemed to poison the ground and raise hell upon the generations that suffered the aftershocks. The house was in that Victorian style, the kind that evokes luxury at even the slightest glance on an afternoon’s drive by. The siding was white, in which the front was splattered with ivy vines so green the grass descending the front appeared yellow. It was a truly massive estate, holding no less that twelve individual bedrooms, and a kitchen on each of its two floors, three including the cellar, though the cellar did not contain a kitchen of its own.

When Dr. Lowrey first pushed the door free from its near glued-in posture, plumes of smoke and dead skin descended gently from anything he could see. The sun’s rays hardly managed through the windows, which themselves could hardly be considered windows anymore. The detritus that littered the floors and every surface, now caked on to Dr. Lowrey’s shoes, and pant cuffs, and gave the whole place a sense of abandonment, even though the last owner had only inhabited it less than a year preceding Dr. Lowrey’s visit. Dr. Lowrey, who henceforth we will refer to as Thomas, felt distinctly disturbed by the house, it was not the act of one thing in particular that left him with the sense of unease that turns your gut, and screams *run* at every moment. No, instead it was the imposing and uncanny nature of the estate that left him so uncomfortable.

Infront of Thomas was a single spiral staircase, resilient against the house it stood tall and strong. Its dark stained oak had not discolored, and its railings had not chipped. A desiccated carpet found itself slowly decaying down the stairs, with holes that made it look almost knit. Thomas uncomfortable shifted around, unsure of where to put himself in the massive, yet cramped estate. It was in this moment, that Thomas jumped up for a minute, when behind him the door swung open with a childish shriek, and one Amelia Lowrey burst into the room. “How just positively fantastic!” Amelia squealed, over annunciating every word, and her accent posher with every syllable. As she burst forward, she spans in circles kicking up dust as she walked. Her face turned all around like some kind of lost puppy, but in truth she looked more found than could be said for Thomas.

“Oooh I just, well I just love it, don’t you Thomas?” Amelia queried, slightly offended at Thomas’s grim face. “I suppose, it’s something.” Thomas stated, before turned his attention toward the scurry of a small mouse that ran with the hurry of a small beast across the foyer. “Adorable. Positively adorable.” Amelia swooned, and Thomas sighed with a weight on his chest that would make a muscleman jealous. Thomas began his approach toward the first kitchen, when was directly to the left of the foyer, and under a doorless doorframe. More dust fell from the aged wood as he drove through, gently shielding his face and hacking away at the miasma. After grabbing a crusted washcloth, and gently wiping across the window and was some off shade of green, a small amount of dusk light filled the room, gently covering the kitchen in an orangish glow that made it almost tolerable.

Amelia followed close behind, pursing her nose and inspecting every little thing. Suddenly serious, she looked to Thomas, and stated in a concerned tone, “but Thomas... you couldn’t possibly cook in here…” Thomas cocked his head and awaited her follow through, and Amelia with a cracked smile finished “it’s hardly dirty enough.” Thomas groaned and walked to the sink, cranking the faucet a half turn, and jumped back when the water rushed with enough pressure to snap a stone. Washing a glass that still was not safe to drink out of, Thomas filled it with the lukewarm water, and muttered “We must get to sleep soon, it’s been a rather long day.” And suddenly serious again Amelia nodded solemnly and yawned, walking over, and resting her head on Thomas’s shoulder. Thomas rested an arm around her shoulder, and took her arm in his other, now face to face with her. He gently laid a kiss on her forehead, and asked, “but Amelia, which of the twelve rooms will we sleep?” and they both descended into that quiet and senseless laughter that long married couples could.

Night came and day followed, morning fell softly on the manor, and rays of burnt sunlight scorched the wood paneling that floored the bedroom Thomas and Amelia had slept in. Thomas had spent the night without much rest, instead his gaze drawn to counting ghostly sheep on the ceiling. Thomas much wondered as to the conditions of man that could drive such a man, no, a kid, to take their own life. Even under the most hellish conditions that earth can offer, *is innocence not enough to be stay the levels of despair that could force one to take their own life?* It was this morning Thomas found himself holding his razor curiously tight, careful not to let a slip of the blade, by his hand or not, end this investigation so soon. It was some level of insanity that allowed Thomas to bear the unbearable, to explore the unexplorable, but Thomas preferred to think of it as some form of indolent bravery, that never put him in front of gun fire, but instead evils with which he did not even reckon.

The first thing Thomas noticed was that all the dust, the detritus that caked every surface, and baked itself into sun-bleached furnishings, had all but completely disappeared. The floors were neat, as if never stepped on, not one day, and the glass had been wiped clean as the crystal of his watch. The house was perfectly in order, if an inspection were to suddenly impress onto its territory, it would pass beyond any doubt. Thomas ran his hand along the now clean walls, his fingers leaving their prints behind on the shine of plaster. Even the bathroom that was connected singly to the bedroom, was near-polished. The ceramic of the toilet had not yellowed, and the shower curtain was bleached.

The house was oddly calm in the morning, even the soft creak of Amelia’s footsteps seemed almost illusive. He could hear her crank and grind coffee, and he could hear her gently light the fire of the stove, a flicker and a wave that gently flew forth. He could hear the coffee begin to simmer slowly as he pulled the black cotton of his suit over his shoulders and combed to the side his short jet-black hair. From the counter he grabbed his glasses, and with a cocky smile into the mirror, turned with a flash of his jacket, and nearly danced out of the room. He was suddenly stopped when he entered the bedroom and found Amelia still asleep in bed. Thomas, for the first time in a long time, broke his first genuine smile, and shook Amelia’s shoulder, gently whispering “wake up, I think you will just love this.” Amelia began to stir, slowly rustling the covers, and slowly groaning a tired story between dream and reality, before she sat up, and jumped out of bed with the sort of energy that had been forgotten after the war, singing, “Well won’t it just be a mighty fine day!” before her face dropped in concern, seeing Thomas’s slight grin, “Well what happened, come-on, out with-it already will ya?”

Thomas took her hand in his and guided her to the kitchen, Amelia quickly grabbing her hat and necklace off the dresser, while Thomas was saying “I haven’t left the bedroom.” In front of them was a complete breakfast spread, crepes with strawberries and fresh whipped cream, coffee brewed on the stove, and two places set on the table. Orange juice, still with the pulp, was poured into two cups with a pitcher on the table, and some gently seared sausages were laid out in a grand strand. “I think it likes us.” Thomas stated almost joking. Amelia, without even a stutter in her step, or a slight draw in her energy, burst toward the table screaming “Well, thank you, to whomever it may concern!” and began devouring crepes in a way unfitting for any human, much less one of her poshness and disposition.

After they had their fill and cleaned up the neatly laid mess, Thomas began looking through the cupboards, not-slightly disturbed to find only desiccated fruits, and eggs so long rotten they were spilling their innards like soldiers gutted on the battlefield. The milk very well looked like it should be in an academy, now no longer the only living thing in the house, and the bricks of sugar was yellowed and wrinkled, with the skin of an old lady. There was molasses with crystals growing like pillars of quartz, and crackers with types of mold unknown to the universities. Amelia seemed quiet, quite odd for her as Thomas never knew her to be a discreet person. Thomas, now very intrigued, pondered into all the things that could quiet such a force as Amelia. Gently prodding, Thomas put a hand on Amelia’s shoulder, beginning to gently rub the tense muscles, and after a second pulled a chair close, looking deep into her brilliantly cyan eyes, which could put angels to shame. He brushed a few strands of her dandelion bangs to away, and asked her, “Are you sure you want to be here?”

Amelia seemed taken aback, almost offended to a point, her bold brows furrowed, she began twiddling with the feather on her pink hat, and with indignation answered, “It is just, those crepes were oftly good, not even the quite bit an off taste. There just are not the ingredients in the kitchen to cook that. Even using the spoiled ingredients, I looked through the kitchen last night, there were not no sausages, Thomas.” Thomas chuckled, even faced with the object seriousness of Amelia. Thomas had been wondering the same think, but objectively, the situation was outright simply funny, and nothing more. “Perhaps there is a ghost pig they slaughtered,” Thomas joked, “I wonder what happens when a ghost dies?”

Amelia began to laugh slightly at the notion of a ghost swine, joking, “I suppose hell will be having barbeque tonight...” with her voice trailing off. Amelia was suddenly back to staring softly again, now looking off behind Thomas. Thomas, expecting to see some form of ghost or haunting visitor, turned around to see positively nothing. All that was behind Thomas was the back of the kitchen that held the cupboards and the old doorless doorway that led into the bedroom. The cucumber green plastered walls that seemed to flow and move with patterns. Even the Lanterns that lay unlit on rough iron holsters, waiting to bring light once again to the darkened manor. The only paranormal thing Thomas could see, was the abnormal floorplan of the house. Amelia’s voice gently quivered, like a child just done crying, “Thomas can’t you see it?”

“See what Amelia?” Thomas looked closer, still seeing nothing, but Amelia continued, “its, well, it’s just beautiful.”

“By god what is it, Amelia?”

“I think, I think it’s an angel.” And suddenly, Amelia collapsed in a cold sweat on the kitchen table, her hair falling over her, and her hat falling off her head. For a moment longer, Thomas continued staring, almost frantic, hoping for some glimpse of the unknown, of what Amelia could have thought to be an angel, to no avail. Eventually, Thomas lifted Amelia over his shoulder, and laid her back on the bed. Thomas, now completely alone in the house, not for the first time, felt fear. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up, and a shiver traced its cold embrace down his spine. Everything in the house seemed bathed in a blanket of coldness and dread. Thomas paced around the bedroom, every so often bringing a hand to sweep back his now sweat drenched hair. After a couple minutes of this routine, a loud crash sounded from somewhere else in the house. the sound was shrill, the sound of a dropped plate in an abusive home.

Thomas quickly rushed out to the kitchen and back into the foyer, the sound came from downstairs, and Thomas decided to begin searching throughout the many rooms that wound through the manor like a labyrinth, twisting and turning, and Thomas could even swear rooms that he went through disappeared when he retraced his steps. Eventually, Thomas reached a dark room, with no external lighting from the windows. Digging through his pocket, Thomas pulled a lighter and flicked the flickering flame, allowing light to lightly cascade from the palm of his hand. Around him, Thomas found himself surrounded by stone statues. Not but three feet in front of him, Thomas saw a statue of an angel with its arms outstretched, and below it, was a shattered statue of a stone baby.

As Thomas peered into the depths of the hollowed eyes that bestowed a heart of malice into the stone, it was as if all now, and all futures, and all pasts condensed into this one moment. It was eternity incarnate, it was night, it was day. It was all the moments; it was one moment. Thomas felt as if his very soul was being stared into. He saw all that he could not understand, he saw his mother holding him as a baby, and when she looked at him, her eyes were hollow. The stone statue was Thomas now, and Thomas its. It was like staring into a mirror, and the mirror finally stared back. Thomas heard angelic choirs sing their herald songs, and he heard his mother’s voice sing him lullabies. At last Thomas heard one voice, an older women’s voice in a cracked hiss, whisper, “Be not alone here.”

When Thomas’s gaze finally broke, he found himself fallen to the floor below the angel. He was left on his knees with his arms fallen beside him, and he was cold all the way to the core of his very being. Quickly pushing himself to his feet, not without slipping and pushing the stones of the broken statue all away. He rushed out the room, back through the many halls, and back into the kitchen.

It is those, that in the night scream “Be not afraid,” that one needs to fear most. In the lonely silence of a burdened afternoon, after not everyone is settled, and the mice scurry in their walls. Religion has been the ruin of many a zealot in the house with the ivy wall. Whether it be the nuns that took their own lives, after taking the lives of their orphans, or it be the old man that previously owned the estate, who was found smeared in blood not his own, while he was hanging from a window for all to see as they passed by. Crosses flipped upside down can be found in many rooms of the house. If one were to look under the house, they might find many mummified corpses of goats slaughtered but not eaten. If one were to see with clear eyes, they might find the shattered glass of lanterns and vases that were thrown across the room by no man. If one looked close enough, they might even spot the statue of an angel, no longer holding a baby statue, with a necklace depicted a upside down cross, and cracked tears streaming down its stone face.

Thomas, whether he knew if or not, was now truly alone. There was no one who could help him, and he was at no one but the house’s pleasure. It must have been some sadistic side of nature, or some hate-ridden field of science yet to be discovered. Thomas, in truth, was both the most alone he had ever been, and the least alone he would ever be. No one can be truly alone, in the house with the ivy wall, whether it be the caw of a crow in the early morning, or the fall of a chandelier on some unfortunate kid in the evening. And nothing, not even forces separate from science and God, could quell the mourning of a mother who still walked the halls at night. It was in the writings of the last man to posses the house, one Jameson Lowery III, that described a tall lanky figure that paced the halls at night, scratching the walls with claws that hang like knives. It was in this man’s writings, that Thomas found himself so drawn to this these hell-born halls, to the house with the ivy wall.",1,1737121497.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Recognised Limerence and falling for LO last year. A lot of ups and downs over the year. We were on a work trip together and spent one on one time- shopping, coffees etc. It felt glorious! We are both married with children so it's hard to see anything actually happening but we are clearly drawn together.

Work changed a bit and I felt we were moving apart. We spoke at work and it got emotional. We were both in tears and she said she missed me. We took some time and agreed to try and spend a bit of time together to catch up since we weren;t working together. We planned some lunches and outings together to catch up. We started sharing more emotional and personal stuff which deepened the limerence. 

Christmas came and I thought it would be a chance to refresh and have some space. But two days into the holidays she messages and we end up messaging a lot (more than ever) over the holidays. 

The last week or so things seem to have changed though. Shes pulled away- not responding to messages, or taking ages to respond or replying but making it very clipped with no opportunity to expand. 

Feeling very confused and appreciate she maybe too. On the one hand the fact she is pulling away (for whatever reason)  is potentially a good thing for my own sake but I also miss her and the connection we have. Do I just let things go or do I try to keep some sort of connection? ",1,1737121376.0,limerence,0,1.0,False

I'm a 5'9 26F who started carnivore January 1st for weight loss purposes only. I started at 76 KG /167.5 pound and on day 12, I was 70.3 KG/155 pounds. I've been eating the same meal consistently, beef and a little chicken and salmon and eggs. Some days I'll add a piece of hard cheese. I also only eat from 12-7 PM. I typically have 250g beef and 3 eggs for lunch at normally around 1:30 PM and then a can of tuna in water around 7 PM or a bit of Kefir. I'm drinking only black coffee and cooking everything in butter. The only ""cheat"" is that I add pepper and a little Frank's Red.

I was feeling amazing until Monday when I started PMSing. I woke up at 70.8 KG and throughout the week I feel I've gained everything back, but I'm not weighing myself out of fear. I got my period on Thursday and still feel extremely bloated and icky. I'm feeling super defeated as I was on top of the world the first 12 days and so happy and excited about weight loss, but now I feel fatter than ever. I feel less and less hungry every day. For example, yesterday I only had 3 burger patties. I'm not overeating, basically eat OMAD and intermittent fasting, and I don't understand what's happened to my body this week. I normally bloat on my period, but this feels drastic.

I understood that losing 5.7 kilos in 12 days is not a normal weight loss rate and it would definitely slow down, but I didn't expect that I'd gain it all back and feel my stomach larger than ever? My goal is 60-65 KG before May.

  
I also go to strength/conditioning classes 3x a week and Pilates 2x a week. I typically walk 15-20k steps a day and always do home work out videos at night. 

I'm feeling like giving up and just doing a calorie deficit and eating whole foods to lose weight. I've seen all of the amazing weight loss stories thru carnivore and was so optimistic and just feel so stuck and sad - what do I do? Is it just my period or what's happening to my body?!

The other kids there were either a bit older than him or too young to run around. Should I stop this behavior?

Like love is a door I’ve forgotten to open,
Like hearts can be unlocked with a casual touch
And a swipe right can rebuild what we have ended.

They don’t know I’ve tried.
I’ve worn my best face, my best laugh, my best lie,
Scrolling through faces that blur into gray,
Hoping to find you in someone someday.

I’ve asked questions you once asked me.
I’ve listened for the melody of your voice in theirs,
Hoping it might lift the silence that settles like dust
In the empty corners you left behind.

I look for your hands in their gestures,
Your smile in the curve of their lips,
But their words are hollow,
And their laughter feels rehearsed.

They don't know that every date is a ghost story,
That every dinner, every drink, every forced laugh
Is haunted by the memory of you.
You liked your coffee light and sweet. They ask for theirs black.
You hated the rain. And they stand there soaking it in.

And yet, I try,
Fingers aching as I swipe left,
Left,
Left,
Until I’ve run out of matches
And it’s just me and the glaring void of the screen telling me there are no matches remaining.

I don’t tell them how I whisper your name sometimes,
How it echoes in my mind like the last notes of a song
That ends too soon but refuses to fade.
How I still keep your favorite sweater,
The one you left behind,
Because it still smells faintly of you,
Though I’d never admit it.

They say, ""It’s been long enough. You deserve someone new.""
But what they don’t understand is that I don’t want new.
I want you.
I want the you who laughed with your whole chest,
The you who knew my thoughts before I could speak them,
The you who filled the quiet with something more than noise.

And the cruelest part?
The world keeps spinning,
People keep moving,
But my heart remains where you left it...
Still sitting on the porch, waiting for you to come home.

So I go on these dates,
Smiling at strangers,
Pretending I’m not measuring them all
Against the impossible standard of you.

And when they ask me why I’m single,
Why no one is good enough,
I bite my tongue to keep from saying:
""Because you can’t replace the moon with a candle
And expect it to light the same sky.""

They will never be you.
And I will never stop searching
In the vain hope that one day,
In some impossible twist of fate,
I’ll turn a corner,
Look up...
And there you’ll be,
Smiling like you never left.

1i3ghg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1i3ghg5/trip_report_decjan_in_japan_tokyo_kyoto_osaka/,"Trip Report: Dec-Jan in Japan (Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Takayama & Nozawa Onsen)","Hi folks,

We relied heavily on posts from this Reddit community to help with planning our recent Japan trip, so we wanted to contribute back with a trip report. No doubt much of what we include below has been mentioned elsewhere already, and our decisions and opinions are highly personal and subjective, so a lot of this won’t be relevant to many of you - so please feel free to use whatever is helpful and ignore whatever is not!

**Travel Dates:** 20 Dec 2024 to 13 Jan 2025

**Itinerary:**

* Tokyo: 8 days
* Kyoto: 4 days
* Osaka: 3 days
* Takayama: 2 days
* Nozawa Onsen: 4 days
* Tokyo: 4 days

**Random Thoughts:**

* We travelled during one of the busiest times of the year, as well as one of the worst periods (new year’s eve) when everything shuts for a few days. For the most places it was fine, but the crowds got pretty intense in Kyoto around new year.
* My wife (38F) and I (43M) love the big theme parks in the States and are also big Harry Potter fans, so there were some extra days in Tokyo because of this. *We are basically adults who’ve never grown up, and our itinerary reflects that.*
* We wanted to see as many of Japan’s “greatest hits” as possible, so our itinerary was firmly *on* the beaten track.
* It was only myself and my wife travelling, and like everyone warns: 20-30k steps per day became the norm. Our legs, glutes and lower backs were suffering pretty quickly. Also, huge respect to those of you travelling Japan with kids or with accessibility requirements.
* As great and convenient as supermarket konbini is, there’s minimal fibre unless you add something (like a bag of cabbage) to that Famichiki+egg sandwich combo (delicious btw). Btw we tried them all and stand by Family Mart as the best egg sandwich.

**Logistics:** 
* Bookings: We pre-booked as much as possible, with a spreadsheet tracker and reminders set for when things would open up i.e. Disney, Universal, Teamlabs, and Shinkansen tickets. In almost all instances we booked directly, rather than via 3rd parties such as Klook. 
* Transport: As we were travelling around Honshu island only, we used the Shinkansen to get around. We booked tickets in advance rather than getting a JR travel pass. I didn’t do the math to see what was better value, but I wanted to reserve in advance, particularly the Osaka-Takayama leg that only has one direct train each day. 
* SmartEX/JR West: No issues with SmartEX, and we linked them to our phone wallet SUICA cards ok. Booking the behind-the-seat luggage area on the Shinkansen worked great too. JR West bookings weren’t as convenient as I didn’t think it was clear which seats came with the reserved luggage area, and I couldn’t figure out (or maybe it’s not possible) how to link the JR west tickets to our IC. 
* Luggage: While we travelled with a suitcase each, we opted not to use the luggage transfer services (partly out of stubbornness, partly so we’d have access to our stuff). It was fine, mainly because of the next point… 
* Taxis: On travel days we’d either use public transport to reach the Shinkansen, or used uber if public transport involved transfers, to avoid peak hour, and/or if we were feeling lazy. For the most part we found Uber to be fairly reasonable pricing and generally quoted a little cheaper, or the same, as Go. (I don’t know that it matters, as I think they’re all just the final meter anyway + booking surcharge right?) We also used uber when we’d start to fatigue from all the walking. Worth it. 
* Airport Transfers: We used Klook to pre-book transfers to/from the airport because it was convenient and we are somewhat lazy travellers. Worked well, even if it wasn’t very good value compared to trains or the limo buses.
* Dining: we only reserved one meal (an omakase in Tokyo) in advance via Tabelog, and left the rest to chance. This mostly worked except in Kyoto, where so many places seemed booked out. We weren’t fussed about kaiseki anyway - I assume reservations are mandatory for those sort of experiences. That said, some restaurants with great reviews (or that are big on insta) had long queues or were fully booked - this wasn’t such an issue for us as there always seemed to be other solid options nearby. 
* Paying: We preloaded yen onto a digital Revolut card as I’d heard anecdotally that Wise cards had problems (no idea if this is true). Once we bled Revolut dry we reverted to our normal bank card. We had about ¥30,000 in cash on us, which was more than enough: it mainly went to laundry machines, food at markets and paying for goshuin stamps at temples.  Almost everywhere else took Apple Pay touch payment (*tatchi de*), SUICA (*suica de*), or worst case: required a bank card (*kado de*) to be inserted. 
* Language: our Japanese is horrendously bad, and we found Japanese people always very polite and friendly despite our inability to understand them, and they were very tolerant of our lack of ability to communicate. Google Translate was great for bridging the gap, and we had Papago loaded as a backup. 
* Navigating: Google maps. Easy. Seemed pretty accurate for train station exits, train times, and buses.
* eSIMs: we used Ubigi for our roaming given how many Reddit folk speak highly of it. My wife had 5G for much of the trip, while mine was on 4G LTE most  of the time - notably when my wife had 5G. Not sure why, since my phone uses 5G just fine back home. We both got the 10gb/30 day plan and burned through it in less than 2 weeks. One annoying thing is that Ubigi activates the moment you buy it, which wasn’t ideal since I bought my sim in advance and didn’t expect the 30 day clock to start ticking down immediately. I’ve used Nomad previously, and it would only activate when landing in the relevant country and the sim being switched on.
* Crowds: so in Tokyo you stick to the left and Osaka you stick to the right? Something like that, we think… Basically, it’s like every big city where you mostly try to be polite and there’s that 0.001% instance where someone drops a shoulder into you. We were generally impressed with how considerate the Japanese when it came to crowding and queuing. 
* Hygiene: think it’s been said many times here already - there’s a lot of coughing and sniffling at this time of the year. I came down with something on day 12 of the trip, and it took 2 weeks to return to normal. My wife was fine. She was quite diligent about wearing a mask on public transport and in crowds, I wasn’t. 
* Accomm: this was a mix of either booking.com or direct. Used a combination of booking.com and google map reviews to narrow it down, and then compared the booking.com price (including genius discount + cashback) vs direct and went with whichever was cheaper. Didn’t receive any free room upgrades at any of the hotels, which we get semi-commonly when travelling elsewhere or during less busy periods.

**Tokyo (20-27 Dec; 10–13 Jan)**
* Landed at 5am at Haneda airport on the red-eye from Sydney. We pre-booked (via klook) a private transfer, and paid for an extra night’s accomm so that we could check-in upon arrival. It felt much more humane dealing with a 5am arrival.
* We stayed at **Tokyu Stay Shibuya**. The rooms were basic and small, with limited cleaning, but we loved that it was in a quiet pocket of Shibuya just south of Shibuya Scramble. Also, having a washer-dryer in the room was so handy. The hotel reviews are a bit mixed, but I noticed most of the negative stuff was due to either the intermittent cleaning, or that people had booked the annex building by mistake. 
* We chose Shibuya for its convenience and as we’d planned to stay on the east side of Tokyo when we returned. 
* Staying in Shibuya also meant easy access to Hachiko and Shibuya Crossing, and all the shopping in that area (eg Loft and Mega Don) and was super convenient for Harajuku and Shinjuku. 
* The cafe **5 Crossties** was great for getting that Shibuya crossing shot, and a much more chilled experience than Starbucks or Magnet (both of which are closer). 
* Our favourite meal was at **Joto Curry**, an unpretentious katsu curry place surrounded by other places with forever-queues (eg Gyukatsu Motomura - the wait times for Motomura were easily 60+mins unless you arrived early.) 
* We had the omakase at **Ten**, in Shibuya Scramble. Objectively, it’s quite good quality and value (and seems very similar to the omakase at **Manten Sushi** and other great places no doubt) and I like to think I’m a fan of seafood, but both my wife and I were over the sheer seafoodie-ness of it well before the final course. We decided to skip other omakase after that. 
* One of our favourite nights was hitting up a few of the “hidden bars” in the area: **A10**, **Janai Coffee**, and **Osake no Bijutsukan Shibuya Meiji dori** (inside a Family Mart). These were all a lot of fun.
* The cafe **note** in Shibuya, was also a fave of ours. 
* I can't figure out why **Omusako Omurice Shibuya** is so highly rated. Was quite underwhelmed by the quality. 
* We had such a great and unique time at **OttersFamily Otter Petting** in Harajuku. I wanted to pet the little pigs and hedgehogs nearby too, but my wife gave me a look like I’m a crazy person. I’m steering clear of the debate on whether these experiences are in the animal’s best interest.
* We had high hopes for **Teppan Baby**, an okinomiyaki restaurant in Shinjuku with killer google reviews, but I thought the okinomiyaki was bland and small.
* We had a fun and memorable time in Golden Gai speaking broken English and Japanese with random locals in those tiny dive bars.
* I made the dumb mistake of assuming the first Uniqlo in Ginza to appear on my Google maps search result was the flagship. Turns out there are at least 2 big uniqlos in Ginza. Don’t be dumb like me (if visiting the flagship store is important to you). 
* The Tsutaya bookstore in Ginza has some beautiful galleries, and was a lovely visit. Sadly the flagship (and much bigger) Kinokuniya bookstore in Shinjuku is ageing badly by comparison. 
* Not sure if Akihabara has changed or if I’ve changed in the 20 years since my last visit - probably both. Didn’t seem to have as much cool, random stuff as I recall. And we actually found more fun stuff at Shibuya Loft than Akiba. As a Transformer nerd, I thought **Hero Gangu** in Osaka had better stock.

**Tokyo Christmas Markets**
* We’d mistakenly hoped the Tokyo Xmas markets might compare to those in Europe. Not so. And yeah, we get that it’s not a country that traditionally celebrates Xmas, so that’s on us having unrealistic expectations. 
* The markets were still cute, just much smaller than anticipated. 
* The biggest Tokyo Xmas market we visited was in Meiji Jingu Gaien, a dusty baseball field. It was such a let down with no soul, and bad and over-priced food (like a lot of Xmas markets some of you might say).

**Teamlab Borderless & Planets** 
* We'd recommend the 9am sessions if you can nab them; as you’d expect, they just get busier through the day. Both seemed to start letting ppl in before 9am. I thought Planets had more different sensory experiences, and my wife preferred Borderless.

**Warner Bros Harry Potter Studio Tour** 
* As Harry Potter fans we loved it, and it was different enough from the London one to make it worthwhile. While the shop had some overlap with what’s for sale at Harry Potter Mahoudokoro or USJ, each had their own unique stuff too - so if you see something you want just get it rather than holding out.

**Tokyo Disney** 
* We visited DisneySea on Christmas Day, and then visited both DisneyLand and DisneySea in Jan. 
* The Xmas day visit was a lot of fun as it’s a tradition for couples to go to Disney as a date, and wear those silly hats. We were happy to oblige. 
* As anticipated, it was ridiculously busy on Xmas day. But we still managed to get on 6 rides. This included buying Premium passes for two: Rapunzel and Journey to the Centre of the Earth. Indiana Jones we squeezed onto via the single rider queue, and that was probably the longest wait we had at about 40mins. Raging Spirits, Journey to the Centre of the Earth, and Peter Pan we rode via a mix of the free 40th Anniversary and standard standby passes, with timers set every 120mins for when we could book new rides. 
* We arrived at DisneySea at 8am, and they started letting people in at 9am. We scanned our ticket in at approx 9:30am. 
* The **biggest mistake** we made was joining the far-left queue to enter DisneySea (rail entrance side). It moved the slowest as it turned out to be merging two queues into a single entrance. Don’t join the far-left queue. 
* We returned to Disney at the end of the trip, staying at the **Grand Nikko Hotel** for the convenience. Our room was 10th floor park-facing, so evening fireworks were visible. The smaller firework displays for *Reach for the Stars* (DisneyLand) and *Believe! Sea of Dreams* (DisneySea) were far better experienced in the parks than viewed from the hotel. 
* Grand Nikko was spacious and clean, although the bathroom was cramped. The food options around the Bayside hotels seemed over-priced, however Ikspiari by Maihama Station had loads of options. 
* In mid-Jan we joined the morning Disneyland queue at 7:45am and were in by 9:10am. We joined the DisneySea queue at 7:15am and were in by 8:59am.
* They recently removed the restriction for timed entry at Fantasy Springs, DisneySea. 
* Being at Disney in mid-Jan was far more manageable than over Xmas, and we were able to visit more attractions (ie rides): 11 at Disneyland and 17 at DisneySea. We still utilised Premium Access for some of the busier rides. 
* One comparison to Disney in the States or France: we were generally disappointed by how limited and average-quality the food options were at Disney Tokyo.

**Kyoto (28-31 Dec)** 
* We stayed at **Hotel Forza**, conveniently located near Nishiki Market, Pontocho and Gion. The accomm was good enough, and a nice touch was that you’d get a free glass of sake or red wine each evening. 
* Golden Pavilion: busy and not the most convenient to get to on public transport; the buses each direction were jam-packed in the afternoon. Ticks off the only Japanese location on the *Hillmans 100 Things to Do* list, if you’re into that kind of thing. Was perfectly manageable in the afternoon, even with large crowds. 
* Gion: We reached Sannenzaka just before sunrise and there were already people parking their tripods or queuing up to catch those shots all over insta. 
* Arashiyama: the bamboo forest was another place we arrived at sunrise for, and like everything in Kyoto it started to fill up pretty quickly. The nearby **Aribica coffee** had a giant queue from the moment it opened. Adashino Nebutsuji and Otagi Nebutsuji were a couple of beautiful temples nearby. 
* Fushimi Inari Taisha: we switched tactics and climbed this at sunset rather than early morning. The crowds were tough at the base, barely moving through the initial section of gates. As mentioned by many on this thread already, the crowds vastly thin out the closer you get to the top and after sunset it was mostly empty. 
* Our favourite meal in Kyoto was at **Koisus**. Turns out we really like Japanese curry.

**Osaka (1-3 Jan)** 
* We stayed at **Hotel the Flag Shinsaibashi** and this was the first hotel in Japan where I genuinely felt cramped. The standard rooms are advertised as 19sqm, however it felt smaller than our Tokyo (17sqm) and Kyoto (18sqm) accomm - probably due to inefficient room layout. While the location was great for its proximity to Dotonbori and Shinsaibashi-Suji shopping street, i can’t really recommend it. 
* Nara: I mirror everyone else’s previous comments and suggest getting away from the crowds to enjoy your visit. IIRC I’d read a tip to skip the first person selling deer crackers (¥200) as there’d be more later on, however it took us a lot of wandering to find another seller and I wish I’d just bought it from the first one to save time. 
* Dotonbori was super busy over the new year, but getting into restaurants without a reservation was ok. Some real standouts were the flat gyoza at **Chibo Okonomiyaki Restaurant** and the takoyaki at **Takotako King**. 
* Osaka Castle: if you insta/tiktok Osaka Castle there are loads of videos that refer to a “secret photo spot”. Surprise surprise, they’ve blocked off access to this spot. And there were still loads of people hanging around the area trying to get the next best shot possible.

**Universal Studios Japan** 
* We knew that visiting USJ on 2nd Jan would be an intense experience, so we ordered the overpriced Express Pass 7 Variety to skip the queue on 7 rides. Totally worth it in hindsight. We queued for 2.5hrs to ride an attraction we didn’t have an express pass for: Demon Slayer XR, and this reinforced that we’d made the right decision to pay for passes. 
* The most exhilarating ride was Flying Dinosaur, and the most underwhelming was Flight of the Hippogriff. The Harry Potter area was much smaller than Universal Florida, but still a delight if you’re a Harry Potter fan. Super Nintendo World was excellent and the newish Minecart Madness was a blast.

**Takayama (4-5 Jan)** 
* We stayed in **Iori Uramachi**, a stunning split-level accomm managed by the Iori Stay group. It’s situated a few short blocks from the old town, and was just beautiful. 
* The bus to the scenic village of Shirakawa-Go was convenient and very busy - yet another thing we were relieved to have booked in advance. There’s a cute little coffee shop (**エガオヤカフェ**) where the two sisters bake their own baumkuchen.
* We enjoyed the ramen at **Menya Shirakawa Bettei**. While I prefer my noodles a bit springier, my wife described it as the best ramen she’s ever had. 
* It looks like everyone in Takayama wants to eat at **Suzuya**. We tried to get in a couple of times but the queues were too damn long. 
* We tried the Hida beef sushi (¥1,980), and beef steak (¥5,500 for 150gm) at **Kyoshi**. At A5 grade it was decent. Maybe I’m too ignorant about wagyu, but it was chewier than I’d expected.

**Nozawa Onsen (6-9 Jan)** 
* We stayed at **Otagi Tamayura**, a charming inn run by a husband and wife. It’s situated at the base of one of the main gondolas, so the location was perfect. And the town itself is lovely - full of public onsen, great food, and meandering hilly roads that were charming in the snow. 
* There’s 1 bus an hour running between Iiyama Station and Nozawa Onsen, and the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Iiyama is less than 2hrs. A taxi between Iiyama Station and Nozawa Onsen is ¥8,000. 
* It seems that most accomm in Nozawa Onsen has a toilet and sink in the room, and the shared facilities for showering/bathing.  Tamayura had Onsen-style baths split by gender, and these could be booked for private bathing; we really looked forward to soaking in the bath after a day out on the snow. 
* This was our first time snowboarding in Japan and we loved it. It may be that we were lucky that it’s been a great season with excellent snowfall. While Nozawa Onsen isn’t a large resort, it was good value (around ¥7,000 for a day pass) and had some fun, wide runs. It never felt too busy. While I’m curious about some of the larger resorts, particularly on Hokkaido, we are very tempted to return to Nozawa Onsen in the future. 
* We had 2 days on the snow, with the 3rd day at the snow monkey park. We vacuum packed snow jackets, pants, gloves and goggles for the trip, and hired the rest there (around ¥4,000 for boots and boards, ¥1,500 helmet per day). I was particularly excited that they had Burton Step-On gear for hire (¥8,700 per day).
* The baked curry at **Hakuna Matata**, a western-style izakaya, was one of our guilty pleasures of the trip.

**Mistakes & Regrets:** 
* Forgot to book the Aoniyoshi sight-seeing train from Osaka to Nara when it went on sale, and it was sold out when we eventually checked. 
* Assumed we could book last-minute trains from Tokyo to Shimoyoshida (Mt Fuji). Whoops. Turns out this is quite popular and books out early. 
* Not researching/reserving restaurants in Kyoto properly, and struggling to find dinner as a result. 
* Didn’t check what time the Tokyo Bay airport bus starts, and later learned it would be too late for our 9am flight from Narita. Could’ve taken some connecting trains but resorted to a ¥18,000 taxi instead. In hindsight I should’ve booked the last night’s hotel near Narita.

Anyway, that’s the trip report. Thanks for making it this far, and hopefully something in this is helpful!",4,1737120966.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

1i3ggnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1i3ggnu/my_roomates_are_grosslazy_as_fuck/,My roomates are gross/lazy as fuck ,"I’m gonna be real here- I get it. I’ve been at low spots, I’ve let things get dirty here and there. But they take this shit to a new level.

I’ve been living with them for about 6 months. It’s me and my bf, and his cousin and his cousins gf. I’ve been friends with them for about 5 years and we’ve all gotten along rather well.

His gf is so incredibly lazy that it pains me to live with. I have never once seen her sweep, empty the dishwasher, wipe down a surface, vacuum- nothing. The most she will do is throw her dishes in the sink for her bf to do later. Her bf is also kind of lazy, he will do dishes and that is it.

To make matters worse she has a cat that plays in its litter box for fun. Despite a litter mat and an enclosed box there is a permanent trail of litter getting tracked in the house. I sweep that shit everyday, and it’s like it doesn’t phase her. If I don’t do anything the litter just continuously builds. 

I’m so sick and tired of cleaning mutual living areas. Yes I have a higher standard of cleanliness, but if I don’t do it nothing happens. I brought home a kitchen table, and within a week they made it a new home for unsorted paperwork, Amazon boxes, cat toys, and groceries they were too lazy to put away. And it sits like that- FOR WEEKS, MONTHS. 

His gf is ‘looking for a job right now’ and literally all I see her do is microwave pizza rolls and play videogames the moment she wakes up. That’s all she will do. She doordashes coffee and  wraps herself up in a blanket and plays games for 12 hours straight until her bf comes home. 

I’ve given up on asking her to do anything with me because it simply doesn’t interest her. Shopping? She doesn’t feel like walking. Grabbing lunch? Why get up when you could door dash it..? Grabbing a drink? No, she can’t wear her ‘comfies’. 

I want to establish a chore chart and have a talk with them, but every time I suggest this my bf gets hesitant and says ‘I mean I think if they wanted to they would… I’ll just clean more so you can take a break.’ The thing is my bf helps plenty already. I don’t want him to do more work, I want to talk to our roomates so that it’s more equal labor division. 

There a bowl of ranch that’s been sitting in the sink developing its own ecosystem for 2 weeks. Just. That. Single. Bowl. She walks by it everyday, she knows it’s there. She still has 3 moving boxes in the living room that she can’t be bothered to unpack.

I feel super frustrated and like I can’t chill out. Mess and clutter bother me and I feel like I’m the only person trying to make this house clean and comfortable. Leading by example is not working. I have a hunch that if I approach them they will get defensive and it will not help the house be more clean :( 

I guess it’s not the worst… I just struggle to live in gross environments ",6,1737120897.0,Vent,6,1.0,False

1i3ge1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/clusterheads/comments/1i3ge1h/figured_out_why_my_cycles_start/,Figured out why my cycles start,"If you take a look at the risk factors for developing CH, I don’t fit most of them. I started getting my CHs at 18 and not in my late 20s/30s, I have never smoked and avoid nicotine like the plague, am super sensitive to caffeine and never drink coffee or energy drinks, I only drink alcohol a handful of times a year, never had brain injuries or trauma, and I don’t have family history. So why do I get them and what causes mine?

I figured out the cycles only start when my biological clock for my sleep cycle gets drastically altered. If I stay up late one too many times, pull an all nighter when I’m at my limit, or if travel across the world to see family and stay up an extra night to combat jet lag, my cycles start up immediately like clockwork. The second I ignore my sleep health a little more than I should, my cycles start, I know that beyond a doubt now. Luckily taking 10-15 mg sumatriptan the second I feel a shadow coming aborts them asap. I’m super sensitive to caffeine so I thought red bulls or coffee would help stave them off like it does for so many people but I was dead wrong. The only way I’ve gotten my cycles to end is by forcing myself to oversleep a few days in a row to overcompensate for my broken sleep schedules and my brain rewards me and turns off the cycles. I’m taking sleeping like 18/24 hours of the day, forcing myself to nap constantly.

I've seen a lot of reviews and the general consensus is that the GO is built better than the AVX but everyone seems to agree they are both really good value for money. I know that the price point is a bit different, and I don't mind paying extra if the GO is a better machine and value, but on the other hand I don't want to overpay for something that will give me a similar experience.

My biggest concern would mostly be reliability and longevity of the machine. Do any of you have an AVX DB1, Turin Legato or MiiCoffee Apex who can share some info on build quality and longevity? And is it correct to assume that the GO's reliability is excellent?

I have tried taking 15mg of diazepam at nighttime, along with the 10mg of olanzapine. It should knock me out, but it’s just not working- at all. 

I’ve tried not drinking my morning coffee. I would usually drink 3 cups in the morning. I stopped that. Still, even without the caffeine, my body won’t sleep! 

I’m at a loss. I had an appointment with my GP today and she prescribed me the zolpidem. If it doesn’t work, I don’t know what else I’ll do.

1i3gbxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1i3gbxa/this_elder_lost_all_my_respect/,This elder lost all my respect.,"I just want to tell you this story about a close minded and indoctrinated elder. I am also going to try to make it short.

During September 2023 I wanted to give a gift to a friend of mine (the elder). I went to the last meeting of my life to give him the gift. We met each other in a restaurant a couple of weeks later to grab a coffee. During the evening he was talking about JW stuff and I tried to change the topic. He started to talk about abortion, and I also remember that I asked about if he believes that exist life in the universe or that we are all alone?
He answered that ""he does not believe that there exist other type of life in the universe, because the 'bible' do not talk about that topic"".

The next couple of months (October 2023 to February 2024) he called me because of the ""bible study"". I was clear that I was not interested about a bible study (he said that he understood), but I would not mind if we talk about the bible. The thing is that he manipulated me to study the bible without me knowing it.
Anyway, every time he called me we was talking about random stuff and the conversations felt so... empty. It did not feel authentic from his part, he just wanted to study the bible. I mentioned some stories of the bible and asked a lot of questions, and he did dismissed them all. To his credit, he tried to answer some of them the first time (about Lots daughter's & Noah's ark).
The second time, he was very dismissive with my questions.

After these times I asked the questions he said some close minded things like this: ""This does not sound like the boy I knew before, it seems like you hate god, you think like an apostate (I had no idea what that meant in my second language), it sounds like you have 'copied and pasted' these questions from internet, where are you getting all these information?""

I also asked him about the elder book, and he did not answer the questions. I had to be so specific with my questions, but he still did not wanted to answer them.
I had to say ""You want me to be 'careful' what I see on the internet and a Mormon told me about a book that JW elders have"". Then he said ""Yes, we have an elder book"".
Some weeks later I mentioned chapter 14, section 7 & 10. I asked what he would have done in these circumstances... he did not answer me and I thought that was something arrogant to do.

I also wrote about Armageddon once, and I did send him some pictures. I was crying a lot that day. I had a panic attack because of the childhood anxiety growing up because of the barbaric teaching of Armageddon.
I called him a couple of minutes later and asked him ""Are these pictures from WatchTower?"", and he was sincere. He told me ""Yes, these pictures are from WatchTower"".
This conversation is one of the most traumatizing and worst conversation I ever had in my entire life. He said such stupid and close minded things.

1. Your parents are still married according to the bible.

2. We stopped hanging out with you, because you stopped going to the meetings!
My reply was: My parents divorced each other, we were going through a difficult time, we needed you, but you treated all of us in my beloved family like we were disfellowshipped. This is just conditional love.

3. You do not get disfellowshipped for having sex outside or before marriage.
My reply: Someone from the congregation in the past got disfellowshipped twice and another lady from my hometown got disfellowshipped too.

4. There is only one true bible.
My reply: There are several translations of the bible.

5. ARE YOU CALLING ME A LIAR?
My reply: No, I am just saying that you do not know the whole truth.

6. I am not interested having conversations with apostates.

7. If I see you in the meetings I would jump up and down of happiness!
My Reply: You did not when you saw me in September 2023.

8. We love you.
My reply: Thanks.

Mind you, I was crying the whole time, he interrupted me several times, he yelled and screamed at me at one point. He did not show any empathy or sympathy and it felt like he was bullying me. Bullies would bully someone who is crying on the ground. Source: My childhood.
The most absurd thing is that he said that ""He loves me and my family"".
I just wanted to say this: Have you heard anything that I have said?
You treated us like we were disfellowshipped when my parents divorced each other. You have another concept of love. When you love someone you will always be there and show your support. That is unconditional love.
But I just said ""Thanks"".

The last time I wrote to him was (in February 2024) when I saw the speech of Stephen Lett at their website. You know the one with the statement of the babies?
""Look a that little enemy of god"".
I wrote that this is messed up and he tried to come with excuses. He also wanted to explain to me what ""god"" means with that statement. ""It was not Stephen Lett who said it... it is 'god' who is saying this""
I just wanted to write: IS THAT NOT EVEN WORSE?
Anyway, the last thing I wrote was two scriptures from the bible and it is that the god from the old testament created peace and evil (Isiah 45 something, I am probably wrong about this) and that I was going to do my own research (Proverbs 18 or 19, the one who cross examine the other party).
After all these interactions, texts messages and conversation I have realized that he has lost all my respect because he is one of the elders who is looking forward to Armageddon.

You who have read all of this, I am sorry for wasting your time, but I just wanted to write this story so that maybe someone can learn something from this. Just do not try to change their mindset, they are like programmed robots who can not think for themselves.

PS: I have wanted to write this more than 5 months now.",5,1737120493.0,exjw,3,0.86,False

I (37/F) recently went out on a second date with a guy (44/M) who I met on Hinge (I hate and rarely use dating apps so he was a nice surprise). After talking for a week, the first date was simple: coffee shop. And gosh, we could have talked for hours. It felt different than dates in the past. It also felt like a bonus when we both communicated our interest in building healthy relationships. 

We talked frequently and were fairly open and candid with one another. We scheduled our next date three days later expressing mutual excitement.

We had dinner at an Italian spot near his apartment. No alcohol. The conversation was flowing, diving deeper into our lives and family and (gently) into past relationships.

He mentioned his last relationship of 7 months was “devoid of any sexuality” clarifying there was some fear on his part to advance sexually but ultimately decided he wasn’t into that relationship. He also recognized he likely used her to heal following a previous breakup where he considered marriage. (Hindsight: I recognize this is a red flag. In the moment, I gave him the benefit of self-reflection and growth.)

At some point, our thoughts on sex came about. He said:

“I hate the idea that people create arbitrary timeframes that don’t really mean anything. If you’re genuinely into someone, why wait? It shouldn’t change the trajectory.”

Personally, while I try to hold off a few dates, I don’t completely disagree. I relayed:

“Yeah, I mean, I dated one person, had sex on the first night, and were together for 2.5 years. And others where I waited several weeks and months, they told me they were only interested in sex soon after and dipped. It really just depends.”

I felt good about him. The chemistry was strong and we appeared to be aligned in our personal values and dating goals. 

Long story short: He invites me to meet his two sweet cats and… he and I ended up having sex. 

It wasn’t ideal. I intended to wait a little longer but it felt right and most important - emotionally safe, at the time - to proceed.

And he felt emotionally safe to convey some issues related to a traumatic instance in the past where he was raped at 20 years old. I didn’t push for details but I was empathetic. It was a little odd because he said it matter-of-fact, but I took it as he didn’t want to kill the mood. 

Toward the end we agreed: This app thing worked. He could barely stop kissing me. We discussed the next date - he even wanted to plan a sleepover. It was moving fast. But it felt good and I was excited. 

until.

The next day the messages slowed. He mentioned work had been crazy (he’s in military/law enforcement) but the tone was different. 

The following day he was even more removed, leaving a simple, “How was your day” on read for 7 hours which… was unusual but I tried to chalk it up to work and wanted to be patient with him. 

Late last night he drops a bomb:

“its been very busy and i just got home. 

im ok - im realizing that im disappointed that we immediately had sex. im disappointed in myself, not you - as it just changes the nature of this. I feel less invested.”

I immediately called him. And I could hear the frankness and coldness in his voice.

I asked, “…so wait, just like that.. you’re done? It’s over?”

“No… I don’t know. I don’t think so, but I just don’t look at you the same way. I don’t want the same thing anymore.”

“So it’s over.”

“I’m sorry. It’s not your fault. Things just… switched.”

I tried to understand what happened what went wrong. Asking questions and tried to relay how i was feeling in the moment where he replies, “This feels really inappropriate. Like.. you’re forcing things.”

“I’m not forcing anything. I’m trying to tell you how I’m feeling and trying to understand how this happened so quickly.”

I knew I should have fucking waited”

All he could say is: I’m sorry.
Which didn’t feel remotely remorseful.

Oddly enough - while I had a couple of tears, I don’t feel sad. If anything, extremely disappointed for something that felt exciting and bright at the time only to recognize the red flags and take this as another lesson.

I recognize I had several missteps on my end. I bear some responsibility - mainly moving into sex so soon and investing too early. Ignoring several red flags (“I want to run for Mayor but my buddy tells me I’ve had sex with too many women.” *I can see you cringing - I’m cringing too, dear readers*) It was my full intention to ease in slowly while balancing the issues of his prior sexless relationship.

Upon reflection: I do believe that even if I had waited, it may have been doomed. He obviously has unresolved trauma and needs to heal before pursuing any kind of relationship. 

That said: I’m a strong believer that the right person doesn’t make this shit a challenge.

I have been suffering with gastritis for approx 3 years. When it started approx 3 years ago it all started with sudden severe pain above the center of my stomach and under my rib cage which then went to my stomach. I rang 111 and got advised to go to A&E within the hour. That's where my gastritis journey began. I was prescribed omeperazole and a mixture of tablets prescribed by my GP in all I was taking approx 16 tablets a day. I had a number of endoscopys and having the first one 3 years ago a small red lump was seen in the gastric tract of my stomach. I had another endoscopy 8 weeks later and a 5.7mm polyp was formed which I was advised it looked sinister, so I was referred to the MDT at my local hospital. When I had the appointment I was told it wasn't anything to worry about (which was a relief). As the time went on I was able to enjoy normal food without worrying. That was short lived for about a year or so maybe 18 months. I did a e consult with my GP in Nov 2024 and since then i have been at my worst. I have had severe pain, retching, nausea and a huge loss of appetite where I was a healthy 13st 10lbs around Nov and in early Jan I weighed 12st 4lbs. I have vomited coffee like granules and on another occasion fresh blood which I got admitted by ambulance. I think I've attended A&E at least 10 times for the same thing mainly pain in my stomach. I've been taking Co codamols every 4 hours and 20mg of omeperazole and it's helped a bit. I had a consultant appointment and I've been told I have got severe/chronic gastritis, I will be having an urgent colonoscopy and a MRI scan and to take 80mg of omeperazole for a week. Has anyone had similar experiences and what's worked with you with foods drinks etc apart from no fizzy, caffeine, processed and fatty foods.

1i3g0ny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i3g0ny/friend_in_abusive_relationship/,Friend in abusive relationship ,"Long read and I’m bad at summarizing

Friend is in abusive relationship. I don’t think she realizes and I don’t know what to do to help her realize this and get out. She thinks she can fix it with a talk. Any time her terrible bf does something nice it seems to erase all the bad things he’s done. 

My friend B (20F) has been with her bf K (20-21M) for 3 years. 
They recently moved in together to a house HIS grandparents rent out. 
After ~3 months of living together she texted me saying she needed to call. 

K is laid off for the winter (works in construction) and just games all day. He wouldn’t cook or clean or help renovate their house. Would set things up so they could go hunting won’t work on building his credit even though he keeps saying he will. 
B expressed she felt he wasn’t ready to move out because he would go to his parent’s house all the time and spend the night there without telling her until the morning. K would drop anything to go “help his parents” including doing holiday things together. Now that’s a red flag obviously but what really got me is that during thanksgiving B had a really bad kidney infection and she was hosting! K didn’t do anything to help to help her. I told her that sounds like he doesn’t care about you at all. Her words were “I know he’s sad that I’m in pain” she asked him to just clean the house a bit and he couldn’t even do that. He literally did nothing while B is crying from the pain and under the pressure of hosting for the first time. 
During this phone call I also found out that he says things like “you’re never leaving right?” “You won’t leave if I do ___ right?”
She brought up him not doing anything probably 2 times a month and he always just brushed it off or would start fixing his act but then revert back to his ways. 
Here’s another kicker. He gave his mom a key to their house without consulting or even telling my friend. EXCUSE ME? 

I tell her have a serious conversation try and see what’s up maybe he’s depressed. 
She tries to talk about everything even wrote out what she wanted to say and it was really good! All I feels and no you make me. 

Ofc K ignores it pouts and says “ik you’re upset” and leaves for the gym after giving her a hug and picking her up. Comes back a little later cause he forgot his shoes. She asked him to sleep on the couch. 
K says I think the next day that he wants to “talk things out and work through things” 
Things are going well he’s making breakfast and fixing up the basement but ofc B is waiting for him to go back to doing nothing. And they never did have an actual conversation about the relationship. 
And guess what. His mom comes over unannounced again. After she leaves B says how she doesn’t like K’s mom coming over unannounced and they get in a fight ending with K yelling in B’s face. Her words. as in got up close to her and yelled. K ofc acts so sorry and asks if B can forgive him. They are both religious btw. 

B and I met for coffee and I ask about the relationship, find out that K told B she can’t be a member of her religion and their kids won’t be her religion. 

I tell B I’m literally scared for her safety and that him yelling in her face after three years never doing that seems purposeful. A scare tactic. B lets it out that she is scared to break up with K now. 
She seemed to want to avoid the conversation and ended with saying that she needs to talk to him about it. 
Seems like B is still trying to fix things and I know they aren’t fixable. A talk just leaves room for him to manipulate. I am genuinely scared for her. I feel like if she stays it will turn in to me hearing about her on the news. 
Also found out that during the 3 years he was late to events that were very very important to her. And I found out recently that she just comes home from work and he isn’t there so she assumes he’s at his parent’s house since he doesn’t text her. 
Makes me think he’s cheating even more. 

Now that you know everything 
I don’t know what to do. She’s scared of people being disappointed in her if she leaves cause “ he’s a good guy”. 
I don’t know how to help her or what to say to open her eyes. I feel like there might be nothing.

1i3g0ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i3g0ic/i_m30_caught_my_wifes_friends_fiancé_m33_stealing/,"I, M30, caught my wife's friend's fiancé, M33, stealing my alcohol.","Hi all,


My wife wants to cut all ties with him and tell her friend, is this the right approach?
Do we tell my wife's friend? Do we make tackle it with the fiance directly?


My wife isn't from around here, and she's autistic, and I've been worried that she's isolated and doesn't necessarily have a supportive network to lean on. I'd hate for her to lose her friend, as her friend is nice, caring, and is a genuinely good friend.

Details about me and my wife:
Mid 30s, One child

Details about friend / friends fiancé:
Mid 30s, no children, getting married, want children.

Backstory:

Me and my wife have always been wary of her friends fiance. Her friend is great, kind, caring, goes out with her and takes a genuine interest. Her partner however, is the complete opposite. Brash, doesn't listen to anybody, drinks a fair bit in social situations and gets sleepy and dopey. We can always tell when he's had a drink as he struggles to keep his eyes open and seems completely detached from reality.
 They keep offering to babysit for us, which is really nice, but we worry about the child being left alone with her partner, because he completely shuts off, or takes an interest in something for 30s then goes and sits in a corner on his phone ignoring the world.

We normally set up in the lounge, I bring food and drink through, and most times they're round the fiancé will randomly get up and go to the kitchen to fetch himself something. I'm not really bothered by this, but it irks my wife... More on this below.

The event:

My wife has her friend and fiancé round for a movie night. I wasn't happy with this as I was feeling tired after work and not really up for ""entertaining"", and we'd had a few words about this, she told me how much having her friends over meant to her and asked me to play nice and not make a fuss.

As per wife's request, I keep the kitchen door closed, and bring drinks / food / cutlery / glasses through to the lounge and have it all prepped on the coffee table. This was done specifically to stop the fiancé exploring the house... I had some food still cooking in the oven.

After about 15 minutes, the fiancé stands up and goes into the kitchen. This prompts me to check the food in the oven as I had forgotten about it, so I immediately get up and go through...

I walk into the kitchen to see the fiancée stood there with examining a bottle of vodka. Which has been hidden away because of small child. Truth be told, me and my wife don't drink, I can't remember how much was in the bottle (I suspect it was nearly full last time we looked at it, as we haven't drank in 2+ years, and she doesn't drink spirits).

So I hang back for 30s to see what he does, when he spots me, he attempts to hide the bottle of vodka behind his back before realising I'd already clocked it. Not wanting to make a scene (as per wife's request to play nice), I nonchalantly play it off to see what he was doing, and truth be told we don't really drink so I'm not really fussed. I'd hoped he was just looking at the brand and would have made a comment, but he then went to a cupboard, poured himself a 1/3 pint of vodka, topped it up with a mixer, said ""I've had such a day"" and then went back through to the others.

Now, while I don't particularly care about the alcohol going, the following things sit uneasy with me:

1) 2/3 of the 1L bottle was gone. I'm adamant that we bought the vodka for a party with 8 friends 3 years ago, it was opened for a single round of shots, everybody hated the vodka so it went into our ""storage"". I've not seen that bottle for 3 years. It should have been 80% full minimum.

2) He had been in the kitchen for 20s max before I got there, and the vodka was hidden away, so he had gone straight for it. The fact that he had found the vodka means he knew where it was, so has gone through our kitchen before...

3) over Christmas, I'd gone through the alcohol cupboard as we'd had my parents round, and I was surprised at some of the things that had been opened that I don't recall opening. I commented to my wife at the time. I'm beginning to think that this isn't limited to the vodka either.

4) They are our backup babysitters, although we never let him babysit alone because of his sleepiness and dopeyness, with my wife preoccupied with their wedding stuff, her friend keeps pushing for the fiancé to babysit alone while they go out. We have always resisted and found silly reasons why not, we're running out of excuses and are adamant we don't want him around the child now.

5) what else has he been through round our house? They are quite well off, and our house is filled with tat, so I'm not particularly worried about him taking anything of monetary value, but the fact he's gone through our house doesn't sit well with us.

I've told my wife, who originally laughed it off and said to get rid of the alcohol, but now she's slept on it and is more concerned.

I don't want to risk placing a wedge between her and her best friend. I'm not sure what to do.

Advice will be well received and welcomed.

1i3fr0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/1i3fr0b/struggling_with_kids_learning_about_healthy_and/,Struggling with kids learning about 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' in school,"I've got two kids aged 7 and 4 who are both in mainstream school. Since they were babies we've talked about food as 'fuel food' and 'fun food'. I've explained to them the importance of both, we talk about how different foods impact our bodies like certain vitamins in fruit, how sugar impacts energy, protein grows muscles etc. 

We suspect our entire household is on the spectrum, but one way it shows in our children is very literal thinking. Recently they've both been learning about how to stay healthy and it's completely undoing all the work we've done so far. 

Both my children are in small to average sized bodies, their dad is average and I am fat. I've had a terrible history regarding my relationship to food and exercise, I think I'm now at the best place I've ever been. I feel like I can't bring this up with school as I'll be seen as 'the fat mum that doesn't want the kids learning about health'. We live in a pretty narrow minded area rife with diet culture.

I find this whole ordeal really triggering. At one point my 4yo daughter was refusing to eat anything she deemed to be 'unhealthy' and was telling us that it was not good for us. I'm suspecting she got this from school. I would sit with a coffee and a biscuit and she'd remind me it's not good or healthy. I didn't say anything other than 'they taste good though' but I felt really upset and bothered.

Another instance was when I was making our evening meal and they both stood around in the kitchen talking about which ingredients were healthy and unhealthy and telling me the whole meal should be healthy. I kept my cool and explained about balance but I was feeling really upset that at such a young age they were preaching at me about something we talk about all the time. Like they knew better than me.

I know my game plan moving forward just needs to be what I did before and calmly reinforce what we already speak about. But it feels like this will be an uphill battle. My (thin, chronically undereating) Mum would comment on my food choices my entire childhood, now my own children are doing it. The teachers they are learning from are all in thin bodies too.

We don't have the 'healthiest' diet in the world, but there's balance and it's pretty good considering the four of us have our own issues and preferences around food due to textures and intolerances etc. I make a homecooked meal for our dinner most days. We explore food often, I'll buy new fruits in the food shop for us all to try together, and the kids have the 'healthiest' diets in the house because of my efforts. 

I'm worried about where this could go. I don't want to feel looked down upon in my own house by my own children. They have never spoken about my body size in anything other than practical, objective ways but they do point out when bad guys in Disney films are fat.

Sometimes I’m not sure how clear it is what a song is about. What does this seem like it’s about to you? While it uses first and second person, it’s not autobio. Here’s the lyrics if my singing isn’t clear enough.

Detective of the Heart

Took a chance on you honey
You seemed nice
Your profile was comely
Message was polite
And that’s what I like

Then dinner was lovely
You sure don’t hurt my eyes
And I started thinking
Oh, I could stay the night

Then you brought me my coffee in your bed
You called me your little sleepyhead
You said we should get something to eat
And found a place that’s quiet and discreet
Well, that sounds good to me

Take a chance on me honey
But you seem so blue
I know what you like
Let me give it to you

You’d tell me anything I want to know
But I’d never ask about that though
Baby, you can keep your secret parts

1i3fplq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i3fplq/aitah_for_wanting_to_end_things_for_good_with_my/,"AITAH for wanting to end things for good with my boyfriend, even though I still love him?","I (24F) and my boyfriend (33M) have been dating for a year, but we decided to take a break about four months ago. The break was mutual—I needed to focus on finishing my degree, working 1-2 jobs to stay afloat, and managing my autoimmune disease, which drains a lot of my energy.

He comes from a small town and grew up pretty isolated, which left him with very low self-worth and struggling with adult responsibilities. He hasn’t had a job in years. At first, I was supportive, but over time, I realized he was getting too comfortable. There are jobs out there, but he always has an excuse for why none of them will work. I used to help him financially, but now I barely make enough for myself, so I can’t anymore.

Since the break, I’ve been working and studying nonstop, with only occasional coffee dates with friends once every two weeks. I talk to my best friend for 30 minutes regularly and him for about two hours most of the time. Despite this, he’s still jealous of the little time I spend with anyone else. It’s frustrating because when we do spend time together, it usually consists of me cooking, us eating, and then him asking if I want to have sex.

Talking to him during this break has made me notice other troubling things. Most of our conversations are about his life, problems, or other girls (we agreed to be open during the break). Then, he’ll ask me for something—money or sex—and throw in a quick “you good, btw?”

He’s also been thoughtless in ways that hurt me. For example, he made plans with friends to see one of my favorite bands without inviting me because he “forgot” I like that type of music. Or he’ll assume I don’t want to go dancing or to see superhero movies, even though I’ve told him I love those things.

During our relationship, we also clashed over his ""self-diagnosed hypersexuality."" He’d beg for oral even when I was sick or exhausted, and if I said no, he’d throw tantrums or punch things. He has improved in some ways—he complains less about minor injuries, stopped commenting on my weight (I’m curvy but not overweight), and tries to remember my interests. But overall, I’ve realized he still leans on me too much and hasn’t learned to be self-sufficient.

Now that my exams are nearly over, he’s pushing to get back together. But honestly, I’ve felt so much calmer and less stressed during this break. I love him deeply, but I’m realizing how much he has “unintentionally weaponized incompetence” and how much I’ve been carrying in this relationship.

I feel guilty because he’s a good person who just doesn’t know how to be an adult, but I think I need to end things for good for my own well-being. AITAH?",5,1737118490.0,AITAH,12,0.86,False

Me and my bf’s relationship has always been basically perfect.He’s sweet, attentive, loving; the kind of guy that would hold your umbrella while walking in the rain. The only problem has always been how possessive his girl best friend is towards him and his time. She’d routinely get upset and jealous whenever he turned her down to hang out with me, despite the fact that he still managed to see her weekly. I’d also never demand he spend time with me; he’d do so freely, without me asking. This didn’t stop her from throwing several tantrums, the biggest one being when she stormed out of a group hangout because me and my boyfriend had announced we wanted to organize a trip she wanted him to go on with her instead of me, his girlfriend of more than a year.

However, last week something else happened that broke the camel’s back.
My beloved grandma had fallen in her house and died in the hospital five days later as a result of the fall. I was devastated as she was like a second mother to be and it’s the first big loss I have experienced. This girl not only didn’t offer her condolences (my boyfriend texted her explaining what had happened, she didn’t reply to that text but replied to another unrelated one), but she also got upset because my boyfriend turned down lunch together two days after my grandma’s funeral because he saw how much I was hurting and wanted to comfort me. She went off on him for making HER feel neglected. At a time where I could barely have a conversation without bursting into tears and needed him more than ever. Like he does every single time she acts out, my boyfriend talked to her and tried to set boundaries. She appears to have understood how out of line she was, but we were under the same impression the last few times it happened and yet, here we are. I told him that I don’t want to see her anymore and I prefer he keeps us separate from now on and he told me I was right and he supports me 100%. 

Yesterday while I was at work they got coffee together, and I was surprised at how hurt I felt that he would spend time with sometime that makes me feel disrespected and unimportant over and over again. It’s like she gets to act out and only gets a slap in the wrist as a result. Empty words but no real consequences for her disrespect towards me and my relationship, which I think she sees as secondary to her friendship with my boyfriend. I haven’t told my boyfriend that I’m upset, because I know he’d just “talk to her” with no real weight behind his words, and then we’d go back to the same situation, but I’ve definitely been a bit distant from him since then and I don’t know whether I should broach the subject for the milionth time or just keep quiet since it’s no use anyway. 
So Reddit, what do I do? Do I say something or keep quiet and deal with it on my own? Any guidance is appreciated.

TL;DR: my boyfriend’s best friend demanded he hangs out with her after my grandma died and got upset when he refused. My boyfriend is ok with this, I feel disrespected.

1i3fgvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dialysis/comments/1i3fgvj/my_journey_so_far/,My Journey so far,"Hi, all. I’ve browsed Reddit for years but this is the first time I’ve felt compelled to post in the event my, albeit short experience to far, can help anyone else. 

40 y/o married male with (2) young children. I run a small construction company and chalked up the previous years’s lower back pain to a vertebrae issue and assumed my fatigue to be associated with a busy work schedule, coupled with being 40 and chasing around 2 active kids.

I had not seen a primary care doctor in over a year and went for a routine physical last month at my wife’s behest. I was aware since college that I had high blood pressure, but was not actively mitigating it as I did not like the way the combination of the prescribed blood pressure meds made me feel. Turns out, I had raging hypertension and was walking around at low 200’s / mid-100’s, effectively killing both of my kidneys. Without my wife’s intuition, I would be dead right now.

My primary care doctor called me the day after my physical with the results from my labs and advised that my GFR was 4 (currently 2) and I would likely need to begin dialysis immediately and seek a transplant. He referred me to my nephrologist and the fight began.

I sunk into the initial pit of despair, anxiety, fear, and anger, I’m sure everyone of you experienced in one degree or another. I thought my life was over and I was going to lose the only thing I cared about, my family.

At the initial consultation with my nephrologist, he tried to give me an overview of my situation in that meeting. We all know it is impossible to obtain all the answers and questions running through my mind. However, I left that appointment with a better understanding of the gravity of my diagnosis and a better grasp of the path forward. It was time to dig in. 

I am beyond blessed with my support system. I have divorced parents who both remarried when I was young and the type of mother and father-in-law people dream about. They all have a wonderful, tight relationship and have banded together and sacrificed to help me see me through this. I recognize 100%, this type of support is atypical in scenarios like mine/ours. I leaned into my faith, and turned everything over to my deity. I try to keep a constant dialogue with him to guide me. I have been seeking this relationship my whole life, and I feel certain that I will look back on this difficult time as the turning point that I needed and the greatest thing to happen to me, instead of the worst. If you are reading this and align with any type of higher power, I cannot recommend enough leaning into that as hard as you can.

In the beginning, the waiting is (and still is) the hardest part. Time creeps along. I researched anything I could do that was actionable in an effort to best position myself for the road ahead. I began to research based on my diagnosis, things I could immediately start doing for myself and levers I could pull. I sought out resources on .edu, .org and .gov websites. I avoided .com websites as well as Reddit, initially. As much as I wanted to read positive, uplifting, real life experiences, I did not want to risk reading negative ones, compromising my morale and outlook forward.

I immediately insured I was hydrating without over hydrating as I did not want to retain water. I was and still am barely able to urinate. I adjusted my diet the best I could, without the assistance of a dietitian, and dropped the sodium, potassium, etc. I was a heavy cannabis consumer at night to assist with sleeping. I would vaporize in my garage before bed after I put my kids to sleep to the tune of 1 ounce per month. I stopped self medicating with cannabis on day one and have not looked back. I am 30+ days clean for the first time since I was 16 years old. No alcohol or sodas. Doing something, anything that me feel like I was having a positive impact on my health, made me feel incrementally better and began to ease my mind & anxiety.

My nephrologist recommended that I proceed with PD dialysis given my age and lifestyle. My port was placed in the day after Christmas, two weeks after my diagnosis. As this was an outpatient procedure, I was unprepared for the, post-op pain. The first week after was rough there are no two ways about it. You just have to get through it, it gets better. The narcotic they prescribed me for the pain made me constipated for a week+. I did not take the full prescription and switch to Tylenol which ended up being just as effective. On the inconvenience front, the “Bird baths” are not my favorite. I am a two shower a day guy. I don’t drink coffee in the morning and like a hot shower to wake up before I head out for the day. I still have not showered as of this post. The pain dissipates and the incisions start to heal. My dressings are still being changed in a sterile environment at the doctors office and I am thankful for this as I have not grown accustomed to seeing the port in my abdomen. I know soon enough, the cleaning and caring of it will be in my hands, and I will have to address it, but until then I lay back in the chair while the nurses assess, clean and re-wrap. I’m grateful that it has healed well and I now wear a Velcro belt which supports it 24/7. The combination of the slightly rough material on the belt, coupled with the hair on my stomach growing back that was shaved for the operation has been irritating and uncomfortable. I purchased a package of Haynes undershirts and cut the bottom hem off of one the same height as the belt, cut two slits in it so that the belt can pass through and the T-shirt is touching my skin, not the belt, or Velcro. I’m sure there’s something specific that you can purchase for this application or perhaps even a different belt altogether but it works for the time being.

On Monday, I went to the home dialysis training clinic where they flushed/tested my port to ensure function and did two manual 2L fill, dwell and drain exchanges. The fill and drain sensations are strong and a couple times I felt a slight pinch in my abdomen, but adjusting my seating position and/or standing up helped alleviate that. I filled in 10 mins and drained in 10 mins, each time with 2L in and 2L out during both exchanges. The clinic was booked on Tuesday and I took my iPad and ran through the modules for self PD dialysis at home. I returned Wednesday and did my first 6L exchange on the cycler, learning the proper cleaning and administering protocols from my training nurse. I arrived at 9 AM and was leaving at 3 PM. So far so good. I’m not sure if I felt physically better from the toxins being drained or if it was a placebo effect, or both. But seeing the clear liquid go into the machine and the yellow liquid on the floor afterwards, told my mind those are the toxins and poisons that your kidneys could not get out and they are now out. Keep going. This was the most relief I’ve felt to date. My dad drove me home, I briefly ate a small meal as I did not and still do not have much of an appetite and collapsed on my bed, sleeping for four hours. The most continuous and fulfilling rest I’ve had since I was diagnosed. The insomnia has been real.

I returned today and repeated the same schedule as yesterday, this time with the nurse pretty much putting 100% of today’s dialysis in my hands under her close guidance. She has been a fantastic coach. If you have a question, ask it. There’s little or no margin for error. These toxins need to get out and you need to avoid infection at all cost. Clean, clean, clean. Do not contaminate. My wife and father met with my social worker today. I had fallen asleep during the second exchange and they did not wake me. She will return tomorrow to meet me. We were done for the day at 3 PM and the nurse disconnected me as I felt the urge to use the restroom and could not afford to delay. No luck using the restroom. I am still battling constipation. The discharge bag on the floor was yellow again, and I felt another rush of relief. I returned home and napped again for about an hour.

While I was asleep, the nurse called and spoke to my wife and advised that my training has progressed well and I can begin home dialysis tonight as long as I’ve completed the rest of the training modules on my iPad. I completed the modules as instructed. The nurse advised that the plan for today is to arrive at 9:00 and do one - two exchanges and return home with my cycler and equipment, set it up and wait for her arrival. She will come this afternoon and we will do two 2 exchanges together under her supervision and if she’s satisfied with the way I execute the procedure, I will finally get to self dialysis overnight. I am nervous but overwhelmed with excitement. Time still move slowly but now at a slightly faster pace. One month ago I could not foresee myself getting to this point. I’m overwhelmed with gratitude.

A few last notes:

I have organized the inventory from my delivery from Baxter with precision to ensure I can access what I need, when I need it it.

When I return home today with my cycler, I plan to set my bedside dialysis station up in the most organized fashion possible to ensure ease of access when performing PD.

My wife and I just purchased this 63-year-old home two months ago and it was not very well maintained. We have had our room painted and a professional sanitation service clean our bedroom and bathroom. We also had the ducts cleaned as they were filthy and I don’t want particulate blowing around.

I am pretty much having to force myself to drink water at this time. I simply do not have an appetite for it. We purchased a chewy ice machine on Amazon and I absolutely love it. I’ve been eating over 10 cups a day. It’s really the only thing I eat these days that gives me any joy. I’m sure my anemia and low iron has a part in this. I’ve also been eating a good, hospitalize throughout the day at the center.

As I’m still battling constipation as my number one issue right now, I’m having to force myself to eat the necessary calories to stay alive. My brain tells me with every bite “stop eating nothing is coming out.” It has resulted in a tight, but not painful abdomen. The fear associated with potentially preventing my port from functioning correctly has been overwhelming.

Make yourself as comfortable as you can. I’ve taken to loungewear at home. I take a small down throw, pillow and eye cover to dialysis and pretty much stay reclined in the chair all day unless instructed otherwise.

Move slow. Give yourself time time to rest and heal. I have been struggling with slight bouts of mania, depression, and anxiety also. I’ve been obsessing over trying to work as long as I can and not lose my business. I’m a one-man operation and I immediately hired a qualified project manager to take over my day-to-day workload, even though I really can’t afford the overhead at the moment. None of that matters if I die. If I have to stop my work entirely, I have now accepted that. I am no good to myself or anyone else if I’m dead.

The insomnia is the worst symptom of all next to the constipation.My pharmacist recommend I take melatonin for the insomnia. My nephrologist advised it was OK. I took it two nights and had the worst nightmares in my life. I’ll never take it again. Your mileage may vary.

The other two symptoms I have not been able to get a handle on yet are the restless leg and itching. The itching I can deal with, but the RLS is absolutely terrible. I hope the dialysis helps.

Get your teeth checked. The effects of my failed kidneys have resulted in immediate, heavy growrh of plaque on the inside of my lower gum line. I made an appointment with the dentist to address, remove and mitigate going forward. My doctor prescribed an anabiotic for the teeth cleaning to ensure I did not get an infection.

I have health insurance, but it is not covering everything. The bills to date are manageable and I have applied for Medicaid supplement to hopefully assist. Initially, I was very concerned about going into medical debt. I’ll just have to figure that out when the time comes. The only thing that matters now is staying as healthy as I can and hoping that I can get a kidney. 

I’m anxious to meet with the transplant coordinator and be placed on the transplant list while we wait to see if any of my brothers or sister are a potential match. I have not researched this yet as I did not want to overwhelm myself until I got closer to the point we are now.

Apologies for the lengthy post, run-on sentences, and punctuation/spelling errors. I’m a construction worker.

The fight is on, and I can only look at this through the windshield, not the rearview mirror. I’ll do everything I can to stay on this earth for my children.

Good luck to each and everyone of you. May you all fully recover and find peace. Thank you for letting me share.

My dressings are still being changed in a sterile environment at the doctors office and I am thankful for this as I have not grown accustomed to seeing the port in my abdomen. I know soon enough, the cleaning and caring of it will be in my hands, and I will have to address it, but until then I lay back in the chair while the nurses assess, clean and re-wrap. I’m grateful that it has healed well and I now wear a Velcro belt which supports it 24/7. The combination of the slightly rough material on the belt, coupled with the hair on my stomach growing back that was shaved for the operation has been irritating and uncomfortable. I purchased a package of Haynes undershirts and cut the bottom hem off of one the same height as the belt, cut two slits in it so that the belt can pass through and the T-shirt is touching my skin, not the belt, or Velcro. I’m sure there’s something specific that you can purchase for this application or perhaps even a different belt altogether but it works for the time being.

On Monday, I went to the home dialysis training clinic where they flushed/tested my port to ensure function and did two manual 2L fill, dwell and drain exchanges. The fill and drain sensations are strong and a couple times I felt a slight pinch in my abdomen, but adjusting my seating position and/or standing up helped alleviate that. I filled in 10 mins and drained in 10 mins, each time with 2L in and 2L out during both exchanges. The clinic was booked on Tuesday and I took my iPad and ran through the modules for self PD dialysis at home. I returned Wednesday and did my first 6L exchange on the cycler, learning the proper cleaning and administering protocols from my training nurse. I arrived at 9 AM and was leaving at 3 PM. So far so good. I’m not sure if I felt physically better from the toxins being drained or if it was a placebo effect, or both. But seeing the clear liquid go into the machine and the yellow liquid on the floor afterwards, told my mind those are the toxins and poisons that your kidneys could not get out and they are now out. Keep going. This was the most relief I’ve felt to date. My dad drove me home, I briefly ate a small meal as I did not and still do not have much of an appetite and collapsed on my bed, sleeping for four hours. The most continuous and fulfilling rest I’ve had since I was diagnosed. The insomnia has been real.

I returned today and repeated the same schedule as yesterday, this time with the nurse pretty much putting 100% of today’s dialysis in my hands under her close guidance. She has been a fantastic coach. If you have a question, ask it. There’s little or no margin for error. These toxins need to get out and you need to avoid infection at all cost. Clean, clean, clean. Do not contaminate. My wife and father met with my social worker today. I had fallen asleep during the second exchange and they did not wake me. She will return tomorrow to meet me. We were done for the day at 3 PM and the nurse disconnected me as I felt the urge to use the restroom and could not afford to delay. No luck using the restroom. I am still battling constipation. The discharge bag on the floor was yellow again, and I felt another rush of relief. I returned home and napped again for about an hour.

While I was asleep, the nurse called and spoke to my wife and advised that my training has progressed well and I can begin home dialysis tonight as long as I’ve completed the rest of the training modules on my iPad. I completed the modules as instructed. The nurse advised that the plan for today is to arrive at 9:00 and do one - two exchanges and return home with my cycler and equipment, set it up and wait for her arrival. She will come this afternoon and we will do two 2 exchanges together under her supervision and if she’s satisfied with the way I execute the procedure, I will finally get to self dialysis overnight. I am nervous but overwhelmed with excitement. Time still move slowly but now at a slightly faster pace. One month ago I could not foresee myself getting to this point. I’m overwhelmed with gratitude.

A few last notes:

I have organized the inventory from my delivery from Baxter with precision to ensure I can access what I need, when I need it it.

When I return home today with my cycler, I plan to set my bedside dialysis station up in the most organized fashion possible to ensure ease of access when performing PD.

My wife and I just purchased this 63-year-old home two months ago and it was not very well maintained. We have had our room painted and a professional sanitation service clean our bedroom and bathroom. We also had the ducts cleaned as they were filthy and I don’t want particulate blowing around.

I am pretty much having to force myself to drink water at this time. I simply do not have an appetite for it. We purchased a chewy ice machine on Amazon and I absolutely love it. I’ve been eating over 10 cups a day. It’s really the only thing I eat these days that gives me any joy. I’m sure my anemia and low iron has a part in this. I’ve also been eating a good, hospitalize throughout the day at the center.

As I’m still battling constipation as my number one issue right now, I’m having to force myself to eat the necessary calories to stay alive. My brain tells me with every bite “stop eating nothing is coming out.” It has resulted in a tight, but not painful abdomen. The fear associated with potentially preventing my port from functioning correctly has been overwhelming.

Make yourself as comfortable as you can. I’ve taken to loungewear at home. I take a small down throw, pillow and eye cover to dialysis and pretty much stay reclined in the chair all day unless instructed otherwise.

Move slow. Give yourself time time to rest and heal. I have been struggling with slight bouts of mania, depression, and anxiety also. I’ve been obsessing over trying to work as long as I can and not lose my business. I’m a one-man operation and I immediately hired a qualified project manager to take over my day-to-day workload, even though I really can’t afford the overhead at the moment. None of that matters if I die. If I have to stop my work entirely, I have now accepted that. I am no good to myself or anyone else if I’m dead.

The insomnia is the worst symptom of all next to the constipation.My pharmacist recommend I take melatonin for the insomnia. My nephrologist advised it was OK. I took it two nights and had the worst nightmares in my life. I’ll never take it again. Your mileage may vary.

The other two symptoms I have not been able to get a handle on yet are the restless leg and itching. The itching I can deal with, but the RLS is absolutely terrible. I hope the dialysis helps.

Get your teeth checked. The effects of my failed kidneys have resulted in immediate, heavy growrh of plaque on the inside of my lower gum line. I made an appointment with the dentist to address, remove and mitigate going forward. My doctor prescribed an anabiotic for the teeth cleaning to ensure I did not get an infection.

I have health insurance, but it is not covering everything. The bills to date are manageable and I have applied for Medicaid supplement to hopefully assist. Initially, I was very concerned about going into medical debt. I’ll just have to figure that out when the time comes. The only thing that matters now is staying as healthy as I can and hoping that I can get a kidney. 

I’m anxious to meet with the transplant coordinator and be placed on the transplant list while we wait to see if any of my brothers or sister are a potential match. I have not researched this yet as I did not want to overwhelm myself until I got closer to the point we are now.

Apologies for the lengthy post, run-on sentences, and punctuation/spelling errors. I’m a construction worker.

The fight is on, and I can only look at this through the windshield, not the rearview mirror. I’ll do everything I can to stay on this earth for my children.

Good luck to each and everyone of you. May you all fully recover and find peace. Thank you for letting me share.

1i3fely,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i3fely,Introducing Bird & Bear Coffee Company ☕️ Coffee meetup on MLK Monday at their roastery? — 4 seats left,"* Posting with mod approval

My friend and I are visiting SF from OC. We found this adorable garage cafe in SF! It’s Bird & Bear Coffee Company, named after the founder’s twin kids.

When I’m in town, I occasionally host small coffee gatherings. After having a wonderful chat with the owner, we thought it would be fun to try it here in SF Bay Area as well.

On MLK Monday 1/20, we are going to meet Bird & Bear’s coffee roastery in Oakland. Since they operate their store based off of their home garage, we decided to move to their roasting facility where they have more space available.

* When: MLK Monday 1/20, 11:00 am - 12:30 pm
* Where: Bird & Bear Coffee Company Roastery in Oakland

75-minutes coffee gathering that includes —

* Private coffee roastery tour
* Guided coffee cupping experience
* Led by Dan, co-founder of Bird & Bear Coffee Company

For those who are new to coffee cupping, it is a method for evaluating and tasting coffee that involves —

* 👀 Observing: Looking at the green beans for defects and the roasted beans
* 👃 Smelling: Noticing the coffee’s aroma
* 👅 Tasting: Sampling the coffee to experience its flavors and notes

Coffee cupping is a professional practice, but anyone can do it. It’s a great way to: develop your sense of taste, learn what coffees you like best, and share your thoughts with others.

When enjoying coffee, we often try one full cup at a time and rarely get a chance to compare different types of beans. It will be a fun and unique opportunity to step into coffee roasting facility’s behind the scene and learn how coffee professionals enjoy their coffee.

Participation: $50 per person

If anyone who wants to purchase beans to repeat quality coffee experience at home, Dan will offer 10% discount on your onsite purchase.

I work in an engineering office, and I’m an engineer. The office is open-plan, meaning the manager’s office is open and connected to where the engineers sit. I was working at my desk, and there were clients and another engineer from a different company sitting with the manager. Everyone there knows me well, and administratively, they are all under my supervision.

While I was working, one of the clients rudely called me, got my name wrong, and said, “I want something hot to drink.” I looked at him and didn’t respond. I wasn’t sure what he was thinking—did he expect me to make him tea or coffee? He knows there’s no office boy in the company.

Normally, I respond to situations like this, but this time I didn’t. The whole situation felt awkward, and my manager ended up stepping in to serve them in order to diffuse the tension. I stayed in my place, didn’t move, and didn’t say anything.

I felt upset for not responding, but I was also worried that saying something inappropriate could lead to losing important clients, especially since this office relies on them to bring in more business.

This might seem like a small issue, but it’s taken up a lot of space in my mind. I just wanted to vent because I feel too embarrassed to talk about this with anyone else.",28,1737116925.0,UAE,23,0.95,False

It wasn't until a year ago when I first heard about misophonia that I thought I might have found the answer to this but I'm still not 100% sure. I've been asking other misophonia sufferers on Reddit what they think and the people that have replied said I have level 7 misophonia with this particular trigger of mine. I'd like to know what other people's thoughts are. To put it short, I have a lot of misophonia triggers. Styrofoam makes me cringe with disgust. Doors slamming enrages me and babies crying puts me into an almost panicked/enraged state. Last year I had a coffee out and a baby started to cry and scream relentlessly. It got so bad, I sprang off my chair and stormed out. Probably not the best response but I couldn't help it. One trigger has given me sexual arousal from an early age, about 9 years old. It started when I was in a school play. When the play had finished and all the students and teachers started to clap, my fourth grade teacher started to whistle. It was one of those loud intermittent whistles that had this tuneless warble and the pitch seemed to go up and down. She must have done this about 5 to 6 times. Needless to say I was very confused as to why my body reacted this way but didn't think much of it. One thing I do remember is feeling a bit panicked not wanting to hear it anymore and was thankful when she stopped. It almost felt like I was being violated. A few years later I went to a TV studio where they were broadcasting a popular game show in my country. Being in an audience, of course there was a lot of whistling going on and the same thing happened. Strong arousal along with anticipatory anxiety and an uncomfortable adrenaline rush. Here's where things get bizarre and I've always felt very peculiar for this. Several times I've been online to see women whistle either using their fingers or without. It also gives me that same adrenaline rush, fast heart beat, dry mouth and turned on feeling. For years I thought I had a really strange kink/fetish and hated the fact I was so odd. I saw an attractive woman whistle using her fingers at a club years ago and found it attractive but also felt overcome with anxiety and froze for a bit. Like I was being stunned by a bolt. Seeing a guy online do it doesn't elicit the same response but irl life anyone can do it and I'll feel a fight or flight response kick in. The volume plays a small part, it it's a loud whistle I'm triggered more easily, but it doesn't always need to be loud. Yet if it's a tuneless, non melodic warble then that's when the arousal and fight or flight hits hardest. Someone whistling in key to a song doesnt elicit the same reaction at all. In fact I find it quite relaxing so that's been another confusing part about this. Another thing I hate about this is the type of arousal I feel. It's different from regular arousal. Along side the fast heart beat, sweating, shakiness etc, I can feel a pit in my stomach and even a shock in my body at times. I think the pit in my stomach is what activates the arousal. I've seen other people's experiences with this condition and most people say their trigger is ubiquitous with just about everyone. Or they'll say their relatives trigger them the most. So this is why I'm asking what this might be although in all fairness, not a lot of research has been done on this condition and maybe I'll never know what this is. What I can say it's a part of me that has been shrouded in secrecy and something I've always been very embarrassed about. ",2,1737116592.0,misophonia,0,1.0,False

Selkirk hunched even lower. “I don’t like to talk about it.” She said.

“But Sel, a Major? That’s not nothing. Just how old are you?” Eastern said. She was right. Rising to Major - especially in the notoriously staid K’laxi Navy - was normally a career long journey.

“I didn’t lie about my age!” Selkirk protested. “I’m thirty three human years old, just like I said. It’s just that… in the Discoverers you rise quickly, especially if you’re a field agent. They want you to have the ability to order people around if necessary.”

“The Discoverers?” Nick said.

“Yeah, it’s like…” Selkirk hesitated, and then looked at the shut door. “Sorry, it’s still odd to be telling you this; they really impress secrecy upon us in training.” She took a breath and continued. “But I want to show you I’m serious about us, so I’m doing this, I’m being… vulnerable.” Selkirk stood up and paced back and forth in the conference room a few times, then stopped and got three mugs of tea from the sideboard and sat back down. Nick took a sip; it was K’laxi tea, woodsy, floral, and kind of tasting like bark - but in a good way. She tried again. “The Discoverers are the K’laxi secret police.” She stopped to watch their expression. 

Eastern gripped her mug, her knuckles white, and Selkirk saw her jaw clench as she fought to remain impassive;  Nick’s eyes widened in surprise, which he hastily attempted to mask with a gulp of tea. Nick was the first to reply. His eyebrows furrowed in confusion as he repeated, “Secret police? Who are you spying on? Other K’laxi?”

Selkirk gave a silent nod in agreement. “That’s usually the target, yes. Our job is to safeguard K’laxi wherever they are. It’s not usually about individuals, but more about protecting the K’laxi, she clarified. 

“Is that the secret to your fixing expertise?” Eastern said, finally speaking up. “Because you could use your contacts here to get whatever you needed?”

While here, I built my own network; however, if I hadn’t or needed help… to persuade others, I could’ve used this resource. Selkirk’s thin smile was at odds with her flat fur and droopy tail. Exhaustion weighed on her. “Honestly, I’m glad you know now. I was tired of pretending... I hope we’re still okay after this.” 

“I’ll be okay in time, but I’m still shocked and hurt,” Eastern said. “You were embedded with us in Hyacinth’s underbelly, feeding information back to your handlers the whole time? How were you able to reconcile your criminal activities with your police work?”

“Come on, let’s go to my room. It’s more comfortable there.” She said, and stood, ignoring Eastern’s question. Selkirk’s room was small and cozy and… anonymous. “All my stuff is in my apartment; that’s where I really lived.” She explained. “I only would sleep up here when I had to spend the day reporting or attending seminars or whatever.”

Nick sat on the bed and leaned up against the wall. Selkirk snuggled up to his left side and buried her head in his chest. “I’m sorry I kept it from you both.” She said, her voice muffled by Nick’s shirt.

“Is that why Jameson paused when you mentioned Mi’leni? Did he know she’s in the K’laxi secret police?” Eastern said, as she sat on the edge of the bed. She looked at Nick and he saw her eyes flash over to his other side, but she must have come to some kind of decision and stayed where she was.

“Er, no. At least I don’t think so. Mi’leni’s cover is that she’s a crime lord. She controls most of Hyacinth that Jameson doesn’t-er, didn’t control. She had the manufacturing arm and about half of the farming arm.”

“Sel, that’s an enormous amount of space. How did she acquire such immense power, but we remained unaware of her existence?” Nick inquired, gently stroking the fur between her ears.

Her eyes flicked up to both of them. “How many K’laxi inhabit Hyacinth?” Selkirk asked.

“I’m not certain, I never really considered it. Perhaps a few thousand?” Eastern chimed in.

“The actual figure is three point eight million K’laxi. It holds the distinction as the largest expat population within Sol and the second largest outside our home system. Only our colony worlds boast a higher K’laxi population.”

“Three point eight…” Eastern leaned in. I didn’t realize so many K’laxi were here.”

Sel nodded. Few consider the farmers, manufacturers, service workers, and sanitation workers that support their daily lives.

Nick started to say, “But they don’t-”, then hesitated. Ambrose’s coffee cart popped into his head. He recalled a K’laxi sweeping and collecting trash. In the cafe, a K’laxi was clearing tables as they enjoyed their pancakes. Who did grow their food anyway? Nick didn’t know any farmers, and since Hyacinth was self sufficient, shouldn’t he know at least a *few* farmers?

Selkirk’s large, expressive eyes pierced him as she looked up, while he looked down at her. “Yes, Nick, they do.” Hyacinth’s operations rely on the exploitation of cheap K’laxi labor. We’re tucked away, out of sight, yet Hyacinth would crumble without us in a matter of weeks. Jameson understood Mi’leni’s power. She could stop Hyacinth in its tracks with just one phone call. The OPA - the Outer Planet Alliance - knew it too. Melody didn’t, she wasn’t here long enough. Raaden is also unaware, but I suspect it’s primarily specism.

“Specism? But she has Um’reli on her team.” Nick said.

“Yeah, but I’m sure she’s ‘one of the good ones’” Selkirk said bitterly. “She knew it too - that’s why she practically begged us to escape. She knew that if we - if I - stayed, that I’d probably wind up dead. Some botched surgery to give me cybernetics like yours, probably.” She said. “We’ve heard rumors of someone doing grisly experiments on K’laxi and dumping the bodies in remote locations. We’ve found a few, and they had signs of precision surgery done on their neural trunks.” Nick felt her shudder. “Be glad you never saw them. I still do, on awful nights.”

“All this time you… you…” Eastern started, and then shook her head, like she was trying to remove the thought. “I’m sorry Sel. I’m having a hard time processing this, and that feels unfair to you.” She climbed up onto the bed and leaned against Selkirk. “I do like you Sel, I really do. I like what we had. What we *have*.” Eastern sighed deeply. “It’s just tough now.”

“I don’t see why it has to be, “Nick said carefully. “Sel is still Sel. The entire time we’ve known her, she was in the, what did you call it? The Discoverers?”

“That’s the translated name. We call it the Mel’itim. It translates roughly to ‘those who discover secrets.’” Selkirk said.

“What about the stuff about your family? About being shipped to Hyacinth because you were inconvenient?”

“Oh, *that’s* all true.” Selkirk said with a wry chuckle. “I am inconvenient to the current head of the familial line, and Hyacinth is a common place to ship K’laxi for them to ‘make their own future’” She parroted. “I became a Discoverer soon after my arrival. Actually, Mi’leni was the one who recruited me. Some people here are jealous because of that.” Her ears twitched as Nick continued stroking the fur between them.

“Okay then.” Eastern said. “First, thank you for being honest with us - I don’t think I said that before; it means a lot to me. Second, I don’t want to go to Parvati.”

“You don’t?” Nick said. He surprised himself. He never expected to revisit Parvati, but Mi’leni’s suggestion suddenly made him excited to bring Eastern and Selkirk home. Bringing them to the beach, to his favorite restaurants, to Touchdown Park in the center of Naya Chennai. He didn’t realize until now how much he wanted to go home.

“I mean, I do.” Eastern said quickly, blushing slightly, “But not at the command of the K’laxi secret police and under some kind of secret cover. I want to go to Parvati because you are taking us there and showing us around.” 

Selkirk inclined her head. “I agree, actually. I disagree with Mi’leni choice, I don’t think staying is the best option. She sat up, her gaze serious and fixed on them. “We should go talk to the AIs, maybe Gord - if we can find him.”

“What? Why? Gord seemed like he wanted nothing to do with us.” Nick said.

“They defeated the Empress last time - I have a hunch they’ll want to know about this new one.”

Eastern stiffened. “But Sel, I have those Nanites too.”

“Yeah, but it’s not like you’re planning on becoming Empress right?”

“No-o” She said carefully.

*Yes you are.*

“You don’t know that.” She thought.

The timbre of their laughter struck her as hollow and peculiar. *You can lie to yourself Eastern, but you can’t lie to us. You crave that power. You* ***like*** *using the Voice.*

\*“\*I also **like** Nick and Selkirk and don’t **like** Raaden. I don’t want to be Empress if it means I have to be like her.”

*You know it doesn’t. There have been hundreds of Empresses, all different. They were never one single personality.* *Some were so beloved that they had plays and songs performed about them for centuries after they passed.*

\*“\*Yeah? And how many obliterated entire planets, or completely wiped out other sapient groups?”

*A few,* they admitted. *But fear is a* ***kind*** *of love.* 

\*“\*It is not, and you know it.” She said.

*As you say… Empress.*

\*“\*Don’t call me that!” 

“See?” Selkirk said. “Eastern wants nothing to do with the Nanites, and doesn’t want to become Empress. Gord knows she has them, but he doesn’t know how much she does. We just keep quiet about them, and let the AIs sort out Raaden. I’m sure they have books and books of ways to kill a human.”

“Okay, but without the Discoverers, how are we going to pay for passage?” Nick said. “We’re flat broke.”

“Are we?” Selkirk said. “My oh my, I wonder what’s inside those packages I took from Raaden’s penthouse.” She dramatically got up from the bed and opened a bag and brought out a folded pad. “Certainly not one of Raaden’s pads, which you can open with your  encryption keys, Nick.” Her gaze met his. She gave you a set of her encryption keys after shaking your hand and winking, didn’t she?”

“She did, yes,” Nick admitted, “But how does that help?”

“Gimmie your hand.” Selkirk took Nick’s hand and pressed it against the pad and he felt the tingle of an encrypted handshake. She lifted it off of the pad and then connected Raaden’s pad to her own with a small cable. “Okay, so then I can just run this… and we can pop this… and…” She smiled to herself. “Tisk risk. For the richest person in Sol, she sure has lax security. We’ll just submit this and inject that…” Her fingers flew over her pad as she was working. She closed both pads and sat there, looking incredibly smug.

“What did you do, Selkirk?” Eastern said in a warning tone.

“Oh, it’s just that Raaden has so much money, she could never spend all of it - she’s a legit trillionaire after all - so I submitted a couple of fake invoices and got paid. Not too much, a rounding error for her, but enough for us to take care of booking a ship and any incidentals we come across.”

“Just how much did you steal, Selkirk?” Nick said with a warning tone.

“Like I said, it would be a rounding error for her!” Sel protested.

“How *much*, Sel?” Eastern added.

“Just a couple hundred million.”

“A couple…” Nick said

“Hundred **million?”** Eastern finished.

“I promise, she won’t even miss it.” Selkirk said and stood. “Come on, I’m not tired, and if we stay here, we risk not being able to strike out on our own. Let’s go down arm and try and find a ship.",8,1737116288.0,HFY,3,0.91,False

basically my friends parents own a small roastery but they're abandoning it because they're busy with their other company.

I have savings so I could give this a try up to a year, but I don't know anything about the business other than that I love drinking coffee haha. My questions are:

\- why would anyone potentially want to order coffee from us if there are dozens of other coffee roasteries around?

\- can a small roastery be profitable?

\- with the coffee prices skyrocketing, is this a risky moment to try to get into the business?

He asked to go to go out and I said it's a super busy period for me multiple birthdays, a small vacation away and Christmas. We're also from 2 different cities, I'm 1.5 hour away from him. He was okay with that and I was like maybe after Christmas I'll come up, it's super easy one/2 trains depending on the station I drive to.

We continued to chat sending pictures of our day etc, etc how we're doing etc normal chat basically, never gone over 24 hours without a reply seemed good, I was enjoying chatting to him.

fast forward I said I was coming up to the city in a week. Now I haven't had a reply in 4 days. I have messaged twice since just to see, and nothing so that's why I feel I'm being ghosted

I know a month is a long time to not meet up, but I did explain the situation and he seemed okay with that and never pushed about meeting again.. maybe I should've taken that as a sign and I was just being a filler for him and now that I said I was going to be nearer he's gone.

I was in the mindset if I did meet him I would've been happy to go up to the city more and make that effort, but I also didn't want to make the journey for nothing so having something else to do in the city as well made a good time to meet in case in person it wasn't a vibe and the journey wasn't wasted for a    coffee meeting or something ( I don't believe in spending a lot on 1st dates for either person) ha

but I guess maybe I was wishful thinking he was okay with the distance, but then don't set your radar that far out then.  only 1.5 hours with easy transport.
