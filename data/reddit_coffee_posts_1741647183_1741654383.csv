I don’t know your name yet, but maybe this is how our story begins.

I’m 39, based in the UK, and after years of navigating life’s highs and lows, I’ve come to understand that love isn’t about finding someone perfect—it’s about finding someone real. Someone whose laugh feels like home, whose presence makes the ordinary extraordinary, and whose heart beats in rhythm with my own.

I’ve been through love before—two decades of it, in fact. And after nearly four years of learning, healing, and rediscovering who I am, I’m ready. Not for games, not for half-measures, but for something with depth, passion, and the kind of connection that makes you want to stay up just a little longer, because saying goodnight feels impossible.

Who I Am

I’m a man who works hard, but loves harder. My career keeps me driven, but my heart is what defines me. I believe in deep conversation, unfiltered laughter, and the small gestures that mean the most. I’m someone who notices—who remembers how you take your coffee, the song that makes you close your eyes when it plays, and the way your voice softens when you talk about something you love.

I value kindness, loyalty, and emotional depth. I’m a romantic in the ways that matter—not just in grand gestures, but in the quiet moments that most overlook. And while I appreciate physical attraction, it’s emotional chemistry that truly sets my soul on fire.

Who I’m Looking For

I want a woman who is open, self-aware, and unafraid to love deeply. Someone who can meet me in the middle—who values trust, passion, and partnership. You don’t have to have it all figured out (who does?), but you’re willing to show up, be present, and build something meaningful.

You appreciate the importance of slow mornings, spontaneous adventures, and the kind of love that feels both exhilarating and grounding. You want a partner, not just a placeholder. You believe that love isn’t just found—it’s built, day by day, through effort, understanding, and an unshakable belief in each other.

A Few More Things…

•	I’m 6’1, with dark hair, brown eyes, and a build that shows I take care of myself—but also love a good meal.

•	I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs. Clean-cut but not rigid about it.

•	I live for road trips, deep conversations, and long walks where time seems to disappear.

•	I love spa weekends, cozy nights in, and date nights where we dress up just because we can.

•	You’ll find me in a navy suit more often than not, because looking sharp is just part of who I am.

•	I’m not opposed to distance if the connection is real—air miles don’t scare me, and neither does a love worth chasing.

If any of this resonates with you, introduce yourself properly. Tell me who you are beyond the surface. Share something real. And if you’re up for it, send a picture—I like to put a face to the energy behind the words.

Let’s see if this could be the last first message we ever send.",1,1741654147.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1j8efbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1j8efbe/the_coffee_catastrophe/,The Coffee Catastrophe,"It was an ordinary Monday morning, or at least, that’s what Jerry thought when he stumbled into the office, half-asleep and desperately clutching his oversized coffee cup like it was the last source of hope in his life. He had just sat down at his desk when he felt it—an eerie presence.

Turning slowly, Jerry came face to face with his worst nightmare: an intern. Not just any intern, but Kyle—the one who called him “dude” and always seemed dangerously close to toppling over the coffee machine. Kyle smiled. “Hey, Jerry! How’s it going?”

Jerry grunted, hoping that was a sufficient response to end the conversation. It was not.

“So, funny thing,” Kyle continued, pulling out a crumpled napkin with what appeared to be blueprints drawn in ketchup. “I had an idea for optimizing the office coffee machine. What if we increase efficiency by removing all the unnecessary buttons?”

Jerry blinked. “You mean…the buttons that control the coffee?”

“Exactly!” Kyle grinned, proud of his own genius.

Jerry sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Kyle, I swear on my dwindling sanity, if you touch that machine—”

Too late. Kyle had already turned and hit something. Something big. Something important. The coffee machine whirred ominously before emitting a high-pitched beep and promptly exploding in a shower of coffee grounds and despair.

The office fell silent. Susan from accounting gasped. Bob from HR clutched his stapler in horror. Jerry, now covered in lukewarm espresso, just sat there, staring into the void.

“Kyle,” Jerry said in a tone so calm it was terrifying. “You have five seconds to run.”

Kyle blinked. “Why would I—”

“Five.”

Kyle turned.

“Four.”

Kyle sprinted.

The entire office erupted into chaos. Susan declared martial law over the remaining coffee supply. Bob built a barricade out of printer paper. Someone was crying in the corner, whispering, “Not the caffeine… not the caffeine…”

As Jerry wiped coffee grounds from his face, he muttered, “Just another Monday.”",1,1741653933.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Keeping things simple I have a boss who is a manager at this car wash let's call him Dave. Dave is 32 years old (M) and overall a nice guy or so I thought  I don't  don't know my dad so whenever Dave tells me he is proud of me for making my sales it felt good and I kind of looked up to him  until recently. We had a meeting. The next day since there isn't a lot of employees that work here there was some food left over. I have some coffee and a piece of cake when in walks this (f) who couldn't be any older than 18 to 19 years old. Now this is where I should say that this story isn't really about me it's about Dave in the end I'll be asking to judge him. So I'm eating my snack when I hear this voice ask me if I work there after cleaning myself up I say yes I did and started to give her the whole customer service spiel. That  how can I help you etc. Then she tells me that Dave called her a bitch! I was taken back by this cuz Dave had never acted that way before my other coworker was in the office with me at the time she was a girl so of course this girl felt more comfortable opening up to her rather than me and  as she did that I went to find my GM (F)  and explain. By the time me and my GM got back  we found that my coworker sent her to the wash since she had stopped halfway to the  entrance of our cleaning tunnel. So we waited for her to come back. She came back and Dave came in soon after and starts yelling at this poor girl telling her that she should leave and that we shouldn't listen to her because she's crazy and yelled at him. Mind you this girl was completely in shock as if this was her first time hearing these accusations luckily my general manager,  calms everyone down and sent Dave back outside and took the girl into her office to get more details. After that day goes on like normal or so I thought I found out later that my general manager had called in Dave after the situation and he ended up leaving early because he was so angry. I stayed behind to talk to my general manager about it after closing and that's when she broke down and literally started actually crying which took me back because usually I break down to people and she broke down to me I felt really awful because she's nothing but a wonderful boss to everybody so, when she told me that David had proceeded to come in and instead of explaining himself calmly he yelled at her and said quote on quote ""if you call HR on me I'll make sure all breaks loose for you"" she told me between sobs she was clearly shaking as well. To make it worse I guess the girl had explained to my manager that she had trouble trusting men. She told me that David must have been having a bad day but I said that there was no excuse I let her know that I support her and we chatted a bit longer till I knew she feel better and I left for the day. So my question is is my assistant manager the asshole for having a bad day? AITA for having a bad day? ",1,1741652874.0,AmItheAsshole,2,0.99,False

1j8dufq,https://www.reddit.com/r/narrativedesign/comments/1j8dufq/what_does_a_narrative_designer_do_all_day/,What Does a Narrative Designer Do All Day?,"**Turning Coffee, Spreadsheets, and Existential Dread into Playable Stories**

by David Gallaher

Coming from a background in comics and television, I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect when I stepped into the world of video games. In comics, the page is your playground, and you control every beat, every pause, every panel. In television, scripts are blueprints for actors and directors to bring to life. But in games?

In games, you don’t tell a story. You build a story—one that players explore, shape, and sometimes break in ways you never saw coming.

Being a narrative designer means spending your days stitching together story and mechanics, making sure the choices players make aren’t just fun but meaningful. It’s architecture and alchemy, part screenwriting, part puzzle design, part prophecy.

# Morning: Outlines, Arcs, and Spreadsheets

Mornings are for worldbuilding. Maybe I’m designing a branching conversation tree where every dialogue option leads to a different consequence, or maybe I’m mapping out an in-game faction’s history down to the graffiti scrawled on its walls. Some days, it’s meetings with designers, discussing how a story beat should unfold through level design rather than a cutscene. Other days, it’s staring at a Google Doc, making sure the pacing of a mission feels as tight as a well-edited comic.

There’s a rhythm to it, a kind of jazz—building a framework while leaving room for improvisation. If comics are a three-act play, game writing is a blues riff that loops, evolves, and bends to the player's choices.

# Afternoon: Writing That Breathes

Midday is for scripting dialogue, not just for the main storyline, but for everything—background NPC chatter, lore entries, combat barks, radio calls that fill the dead air of a long walk across a dystopian wasteland. Every word matters, because in games, silence is just as powerful as speech.

It’s crafting a moment where a mercenary lights a cigarette before an impossible fight, or a radio DJ spinning an old record that hints at the world’s forgotten past. It’s making sure a side quest about finding a lost dog doesn’t just give XP but makes the player *feel* something.

Sometimes, it’s working with voice actors in the recording booth, hearing your words come to life with nuance you never imagined. Other times, it’s adjusting dialogue after a playtest, realizing that a joke that worked on the page falls flat when spoken. Games are alive in a way comics and TV scripts aren’t. They breathe, they react, they demand you listen.

Every now and then, when the gears start grindin’ too loud and the wires get all crossed, I slink into the [Game Industry Coffee Chat](https://www.linkedin.com/company/game-industry-coffee-chat/) on Discord—where the neon hums low, the coffee’s always burnt, and the talk is cheap but worth its weight in gold. I trade war stories with other devs, toss out some hard-earned wisdom, shake a few hands in the dark, and maybe—just maybe—walk out with a new friend or two.

# Evening: Fixing, Tweaking, and Tearing it All Down

By the evening, it’s about refinement. Playtests reveal everything you thought was airtight but isn’t. The villain’s monologue? Too long. The emotional climax? Misses the mark. That choice you thought would be gut-wrenching? Players are skipping it.

Being a narrative designer means loving revision. It’s cutting lines you adored because they slow the pacing. It’s restructuring a mission because players don’t feel the stakes. It’s solving narrative puzzles—how do you make a character’s tragic backstory clear if the player never talks to them? How do you make an open world feel personal?

Some nights, it’s staring at a branching narrative chart with hundreds of nodes, wondering if you’ve built something brilliant or an elaborate disaster. Other nights, it’s scripting a moment so perfect—so *right*—that you can already see it in your mind: the player standing on a rain-slicked street, neon reflecting in puddles, making a choice that will haunt them for hours.

# The Work Behind the Magic

Being a narrative designer isn’t just writing stories—it’s designing experiences. It’s knowing that every system, every mechanic, every piece of UI contributes to the story. The world isn’t just the setting—it’s a character, a storyteller in its own right.

It’s production schedules and Excel sheets, late-night emails and early-morning rewrites. It’s working with artists to make sure a character’s scars match their backstory. It’s telling a story through level design, lighting, and the sound of boots echoing in an empty hallway.

It’s making sure the player doesn’t just watch a story unfold—they live it.

And at the end of the day, when the work is done, and the game is out in the world, the real magic happens—when someone, somewhere, makes a choice in your game that feels like *their* story. When they hesitate before pulling a trigger. When they stop to listen to the rain. When they walk away from the controller, haunted by something you wrote.

That’s when you know you did it right.",3,1741652243.0,narrativedesign,3,1.0,False
1j8du4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1j8du4h/was_i_in_the_wrong_to_get_upset_at_him_for/,Was I in the wrong to get upset at him for flirting with a girl that lives in a different country?,"So I (23f) met this guy (21m) while out at a bar one day a little more than 3 months ago. We started texting a bunch, we were texting all throughout December and flirting. It was clear we were into each other. We also went on several dates during December (out to restaurants, to the movies, to see a christmas tree, out to dance, etc). We started calling each other pet names and we were basically in that “talking stage” without being official yet. We used to hold hands and kiss. Towards the end of December we even hooked up. And we even met each other’s friends. 

He used to tell me he only talks to me and he used to show me his messages on his phone to prove he wasn’t talking to other girls. Basically he was very open about people he talks to. Everything was looking good and things seemed to be progressing. During mid January one night where we decided to go out for a coffee together, he was showing me his phone and I saw a previous phone call from a girl. He told me it’s a girl he is friends with that he knows from his home country. (He moved here about 3 years ago). He told me he doesn’t really talk to her like that but he has wished her a happy bday 2 days before and that they were catching up.

I opened the messages and to my surprise, I saw a lot of flirty messages between them and audios that they were sending each other. I also saw that they were having long phone calls the past two days. He told me that I can look through all the messages with her because he has nothing to hide. I was hurt because he was telling her stuff like “ You’re my only one” and “ I love you” and “ Good morning beautiful” and things like that. After seeing everything, he told me that she lives in his home country and that he only sees her as a friend but he was just being caring and supportive to her because she was going through a recent break up. He told me he doesn’t care about her so he would block her or stop talking to her if it makes me uncomfortable. 

I was upset because I thought we were having something special between us and I didn’t like it that he was treating her the same way he treats me. He started getting defensive and saying “ She doesn’t even live here. You’re being unreasonable. If she lives here then I would understand you. But I haven’t seen her since 3 years ago and I’ve never had anything with her. I don’t have anything to hide. You saw that I just started talking to her again like 2 days ago. I was flirting with her but those are just words. I don’t mean it. You’re the one that I like and the one I spend time with”. Regardless, I was still hurt. We argued about this for about an hour in the cold weather outside. Until finally he told me I can text her or block her from his phone if I want. I sent her a text from his phone saying “ Can you please stop texting me? I don’t want to talk to you like that anymore “ . He seemed pretty upset that I made him say that to her. He told me that I made him end his friendship with her for no reason cause they were literally just friends and that I was being jealous for no reason. 

After this when I got home, I apologized for being jealous. He texted back saying that he just doesn’t understand me because it’s not like she lives here. She lives in a different country and he said it’s better for him to stop “bothering me”. Basically he ended things. I sent him a long paragraph trying to fix things but he just never replied anymore. He got mad at me. 2 weeks after that, we ran into each other at a party and he avoided me. After the party, he texted me out of nowhere saying that he had heard from his friend that I had kissed another guy at the party and that he hopes I enjoyed it. I denied that happened and we talked a little bit. He didn’t seem that mad anymore but he also didn’t seem open to fixing things at all. A few days after that party, I called him to see how he’s doing and he was like “ haha look who’s checking up on who. You’re checking up on me, I haven’t even checking up on you🤣”. Ever since then I decided to stop trying. I unfollowed him and deleted him as a friend on social media. It’s been over a month now and I can’t help but wonder what do you guys think happened here? Did he not like me as I thought? Or did my jealousy that night turn him off? ",1,1741652219.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

But I felt something different around her and I went with it.

On our first date we had coffee and caught up before going a walk and opening up about a lot of our personal stuff and then we sat down on a bench in the forest and she lent her head on my shoulder and I felt soooo good and rested my head on her head we sat like that for awhile as she rubbed my arm and we chatted about anything. Then after we went back to my car and hugged and did the same thing as we did on the bench. Then I dropped her home and she hugged me goodbye.

Today we met again for a shorter period where we hung out in her garden and chatted before going a drive and parked up somewhere nice. Then she kissed me on the cheek and I tried to do the same but ended up kissing her neck somehow which made her blush like mad then we cuddled and then we drove back to her house and I met her parents and me and her dad got on well. Then she hugged me goodbye.

Anyway this is my first time even going on dates with a girl so I’d like some advice on how to do this pleaseeeee!",1,1741652129.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False
1j8dsuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1j8dsuv/emotions/,Emotions.,"TLDR: Went to a park and saw my old house I had to sell. Cried, got over it, didn't drink. 

A year ago I had to sell my beloved house. When I tell you this house was perfect, it was PERFECT. 3 bedrooms, the backyard overlooked a field that leads to a park. I bought it by myself when I was pregnant with my daughter in 2016. My daughter's school is right across from the park. One block away. It had an awesome basement. I had a pretty sizeable garden in the backyard where I grew all kinds of tomatoes, zucchini, cucumbers, peppers, eggplants, blueberries and lots of herbs. It had a screened in back porch (where I spent way too much time drinking. 🙁)

Then, I had 2 floods. One from the 2nd floor bathroom toilet all the way down to the basement that happened overnight. One of the bolts on the toilet tank rusted and the toilet kept filling and flushing by itself all night while my daughter and I slept. The second flood was due to the water heater bursting while I was away for a day. I had also been taking off of work a lot due to Covid and some personal reasons so I kept using Covid forbearance. Well, that ended and the mortgage company asked for $22,000 that I didn't have or the house would foreclose. Not only that, the home insurance went up so high due to the floods that my mortgage payments became unaffordable. If I didn't sell it, it would have foreclosed. I had no choice. Selling that home in November 2023 was one of the worst times of my life.

Earlier today I took my daughter to that park behind our house because the other park was closed for renovations. I couldn't stop crying looking at ""our house."" We were supposed to live there forever. We used to call that park ""our park."" Now we're in a small 1 bedroom apartment. It's not the best but it's ours and comfortable. I'm hoping to buy another house in the coming months, but it will never be that house.

All of this to say, I normally would've gotten home from the park and drank out of sadness. But what would that do? How would that help? It wouldn't and it never did. I may be on the pink cloud of sobriety as they say, but I'm learning to sit with my emotions. Feel sad, be sad or angry or whatever, then move on. Emotions come and go and fluctuate. We're human. But literally unaliving myself by drinking poison won't solve anything. If anything, it just made things much worse. So I'm drinking some coffee then switching to tea lol.

Lately, though, I've had very long, nearly perfect matchups. My past 5 ARAM matches have had a 36 minute, 27 minute and 35 minute match that seriously could have gone either way. I'm not complaining. I love it. 

I'm just curious if it was a complete fluke or this is some new amazing matchmaking mechanic behind the scenes. We won all of my past 5 matches, if anybody was curious. But some of them came down to 5% nexus health... multiple times.",5,1741651905.0,leagueoflegends,5,1.0,False

I havnt been on many dates in my life due to various reasons so I feel like doing it more would be good for me, even without the intention of actually dating to get more comfortable with the act of making plans and getting a drink/coffee with (what is essentially) a stranger.",1,1741651696.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

1j8di74,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1j8di74/what_do_you_get_out_of_a_first_coffeesmall_meal/,What do you get out of a first coffee/small meal date?,"Wondering what others are “checking” for on these dates. 

I try to get a sense of the guys overall personality (is he kind, how interested in his own life he seems, how focused and present he is, and the types of questions he asks and conversation he makes). These things generally let me know if I want to proceed further. This actually happens more on a more organized second date, after a first vibe check. 

My real question is: how much of the above do you focus on, and what do you get from a first coffee date (or second more real date)?

When I leave, I get back in my car, *with the iPad in my backpack on the seat next to me,* then I drive off and get an alert that my iPad has been left behind at the coffee shop. 

This has been happening frequently with both my iPad and my AirPods. I have my iPhone with me at all times, so surely FindMy should “know” where the other items are. What gives?",2,1741651276.0,iphone,0,1.0,False
1j8dhg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1j8dhg9/hey_community_some_advice_please/,Hey community! Some advice please,"We are flying to San Jose purely to get to Central America and would reach at about 430pm tomorrow. Sorry for the late post. Initially was interested to go to La Fortuna for sloths sighting and coffee tour for 2 days, but the shuttle prices and the way the rest of the costs of being in Costa Rica are a bit difficult for us. Not interested in surfing either. But waterfalls would be cool if it’s nearby and cheap-ish to get to. 
We are definitely not into renting a car. Would love to take the local buses since we’ve been traveling like this throughout South America. 
Is it worth it to go to La Fortuna, and would it be easy to get to Liberia from there?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you tired of restless nights and waking up feeling less than refreshed? If so, investing in a king adjustable bed frame can be a game-changer for your sleep quality and overall comfort. These frames not only offer luxurious support but also cater to your specific needs, making bedtime a truly enjoyable experience. Let’s explore the myriad of benefits that king adjustable bed frames can bring to your life.

One prominent advantage of a king adjustable bed frame is its ability to provide personalized comfort. With the touch of a button, you can elevate your head or feet, finding that perfect angle that feels just right for you. This flexibility makes it easier to read, watch TV, or work on your laptop from the comfort of your bed. Whether you prefer a slight incline or a full lift, adjustable bases allow you to customize your sleeping position, ensuring a more restful night.

Health issues like acid reflux or sleep apnea can disrupt your sleep significantly. A king adjustable bed frame promotes a position that can alleviate these concerns. By elevating your upper body, you can reduce the chances of acid reflux, while maintaining open airways can help those suffering from sleep apnea. This tailored support means that you not only sleep better but can also wake up with fewer physical ailments to contend with.

Furthermore, king adjustable bed frames are perfect for couples who have different sleeping preferences. If one partner enjoys sleeping flat while the other prefers an incline, the ability to adjust each side independently ensures that both individuals get the sleep they need. This feature prevents the late-night struggles that come from trying to accommodate each other’s comfort preferences.

Here are some additional benefits to keep in mind:

- **Enhanced Circulation:** Raising your legs can help improve blood flow and reduce swelling. This feature is particularly useful for individuals with circulatory issues.
- **Reduced Snoring:** Elevating your head can help keep airways open, potentially reducing snoring and leading to a more peaceful sleep environment.
- **Convenient Remote Control:** Most king adjustable bed frames come with an easy-to-use remote that allows for effortless adjustments, making it accessible for everyone.
- **Built-in Massage Features:** Some models even offer massage functions, which can soothe sore muscles and further enhance relaxation before falling asleep.

The aesthetic appeal of a king adjustable bed frame cannot be overlooked. With a spacious design and sleek lines, these frames can elevate the look of your bedroom decor. Whether you have a modern, minimalist space or a more traditional style, there are adjustable bed frames available in various designs and finishes to match your taste. This combination of functionality and style creates a sleeping space that is both comfortable and visually appealing.

Another reason to consider a king adjustable bed frame is the incredible durability and support they offer. Many adjustable frames are crafted with high-quality materials, ensuring they can withstand daily use without wear and tear. The robust design provides a strong foundation for your mattress, resulting in a long-lasting investment that enhances your sleep for years to come.

Designing Spacious Bedrooms: Maximizing Style and Functionality with Adjustable Beds
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you think of a spacious bedroom, do you picture a serene retreat that combines style and functionality? One of the best ways to achieve this is by incorporating an adjustable bed. King adjustable bed frames offer luxurious support, transforming your sleeping area into a multifunctional space that balances comfort and modern aesthetics.

-Learn More about Hospital Beds For Your Home Here - https://hownow101.com/adjustable-hospital-beds/  
  
Adjustable beds can elevate the look and feel of your bedroom. They offer not just superior comfort but also a sleek design that complements a wide range of decor styles. With a king adjustable bed frame, you can change the position of your mattress to create the perfect angle for reading, watching television, or simply relaxing. This versatility can make your spacious bedroom feel even more luxurious.

When selecting an adjustable bed frame, there are several features to consider that enhance both functionality and style:

- **Adjustability:** Look for a frame with multiple positions to cater to your preferences, whether you want to elevate your head or feet.
- **Material:** Choose a bed frame made of high-quality materials that provide durability. Wood and metal frames are popular options, offering both elegance and strength.
- **Upholstery:** If comfort and style are essential, consider upholstered models that can complement your bedroom decor while providing a cozy touch.
- **Massage Features:** Some adjustable beds come with built-in massage settings, promoting relaxation at the end of a long day.
- **Smart Technology:** Look for frames with smart features that allow you to adjust settings with your phone or voice commands for added convenience.

Designing a spacious bedroom with a king adjustable bed frame isn’t just about the bed itself; it’s about creating an environment that invites relaxation and rejuvenation. Here are some strategies to maximize both style and functionality:

-Learn More about Hospital Beds For Your Home Here - https://hownow101.com/adjustable-hospital-beds/  
  
First, consider the layout of your room. The adjustable bed should be the focal point, positioned to allow easy access and a clear view of the rest of your space. Positioning it against a wall with a statement piece of artwork can enhance the overall look. Additionally, pairing your frame with nightstands and lamps that match the style can create a cohesive design.

Next, invest in high-quality bedding. Luxurious sheets and comforters can elevate your room’s style while enhancing the comfort of your adjustable bed. Opt for colors and patterns that complement your bedroom's color scheme, making the space feel inviting and elegant.

Don't forget about lighting. Good lighting can make a world of difference in how spacious your bedroom feels. Use a combination of ambient, task, and accent lighting to create a balanced atmosphere. Adjustable bedside lamps are perfect, allowing you to set the mood according to your activities, whether it's reading or winding down for the night.

-Learn More about Hospital Beds For Your Home Here - https://hownow101.com/adjustable-hospital-beds/  
  
Storage solutions are also crucial in maximizing functionality without cluttering the room. Consider utilizing under-bed storage options that can keep your items organized without taking up additional space. This is particularly useful in spacious bedrooms where you want to maintain a sense of openness while ensuring everything you need is within reach.

Having a designated seating area can enhance the usability of your bedroom. A cozy chair or a stylish loveseat can provide a perfect spot for morning coffee or unwinding after a long day. This area adds charm and functionality, making your bedroom feel more like a suite than just a place for sleep.

Let's not overlook the importance of personal touches. Decorate your walls with personal artwork, photographs, or decorative mirrors to add depth and character. Plants can also revive the space and create a calming atmosphere, helping you feel more connected to nature.

By focusing on your layout, bedding quality, lighting, storage solutions, and personal touches, you will create a spacious bedroom that is not only visually stunning but also serves your everyday needs. This approach ensures your bedroom is a sanctuary of comfort and elegance, prepared to meet any desire for relaxation or functionality.

I'm creating a post to share my experience of learning Italian and maybe answer some questions about how to get started. In particular, is Duolingo a waste of time or actually beneficial?

I want to share my first 65 days—from zero to visiting Catania, Sicily. I was able to order pizza, coffee, and even get a free gelato. And best of all, the taxi driver didn’t even rob me!

First of all, who you are (outgoing, introverted?), where you're located, and your exposure to the language do matter.

# A bit about me and my situation

* I live in Malta as an Expat, and speak Norwegian and English fluently, as I've been living abroad for more than 11 years.
* In Malta, Italian is widely spoken by locals, and there's a large group of Italian expats roaming in the country.
* At work, we only speak English, but I have the opportunity to practice my Italian with some of my co-workers daily.
* I'm not afraid to practice and make a joke out of myself.

Before I started to learn Italian, simply everything sounded like a romantic, cracked-up Tommy gun shooting wildly under the water. 

# So, where did I start?

Duolingo was not my first pick, as multiple threads and discussions online advised heavily against, it. So I started by following [Italy Made Easy's](https://www.youtube.com/@italymadeeasy) 30 day challenge. The beginning of the challenge had a great introduction to the language, with the very basis, and tips and tricks on how to get used to the melody, basic pronunciations and maybe the most important for me, keep me engaged and motivated.

While checking in every day for a daily course (video), I kept immersing the language by passively listening in to informercials for 6-8 hours a day ([*QVC Italia*](https://www.youtube.com/@qvcitalia)), not with the intention to understand it, but to get used to listening to the language.

After a week, I started to want more, and looked into apps, and did a trial with Babbel and Duolingo.  
My first impression with Babbel did impress me as I felt it took me straight into the lessons, and Duolingo felt like a slow pace, like watching sea turtles making love in space.

Tho, at the end of the trial, I did uninstall Babbel, not because it was bad, but something Duolingo could do much better:

# Gamification!

Yes, the simple gamification, and positive reenforcement, the nagging and crying owl kept me going, it kept me motivated, and it made learning Italian fun, and I wanted, and still want to go back every day as it doesn't feel like another boring task I need to check into every day, but a fun daily habit. 

Tho, at this stage, 65 days I have not paid for Duolingo, I've been able to keep extending my trial, and I don't think I will pay for it.

# How did it go in real life?

But, I've gotten a very basic level of Italian, and I was heavily challenged two days ago in Catania, and I'm proud to report that I could do basic orders in restaurant for food and drinks, I was able to get taxi to my destinations and could do basic enquiries of prices and so on.

\- Did they understand me? **90% of the time** (*or maybe they were just really nice to me*)  
\- Did I make a fool out of myself: H**ell yeah**.  
\- Did I understand everything they replied with: **Hell no, just what I expected, everything else, was just that Tommy Gun firing.** 

# What’s next?

* Italy Made Easy gave me a great introduction, but I will not pay for their services. 
* Duolingo gave me a great start with the 500 words I needed.
* Babbel didn't keep me motivated as it wasn't fun enough for me.

But now, I'm experimenting with ChatGPT Plus, as I want to focus on my speaking, listening and pronunciation, and yes, so far the only service I've paid for, and I feel I get great progress with different GPT's, and tips from various communities as it can keep up challenging me.   
  
I still keep immersing with QVC Italia and for now, daily ""FREE"" Duolingo, just because I don't want to make the owl cry, and my colleagues, they are getting pestered daily by me. 

# Final Thoughts

I'm happy and proud of my progress.

Is Duolingo worth it? In my experience, yes, it’s been a fantastic companion, but I don’t see myself using it for much longer.

Thanks for reading! If you’re on Day 0, I hope this post gives you some motivation, you’ll be surprised how far you can get if you challenge yourself.

1j8d5mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Commodities/comments/1j8d5mp/advice_for_breaking_into_the_commodities_industry/,Advice for breaking into the commodities industry as a uni student.,"hello all,

I am writing to ask for any advice or tips for breaking into commodities as a university student. I am in my 2nd year at university studying Economics and Econometrics in London (non-Russel group). I have been applying for internships and placement years since September 2024, and I have had no luck.

I have made it to the final round interview for Equinor but was rejected, same for Dare but instead the assessment centre. I haven't heard back from a shipping and logistics company which I applied to back in October (they said that they will inform everybody of their status, accepted or rejected). I have applied to Glencore and Mercuria as an industrial placement intern, in product risk and middle office respectively.

Here is my experience:

Predicted first class for graduation, interned at a HK-based company in their Ho Chi Minh City office researching the Vietnamese real estate market as well as the coffee industry (learnt about how the company sources the coffee and sells it, as well as their intended export market). Part of the university society writing weekly pieces in the student newsletter (during term time) covering news relating to geopolitics and commodities. I have the BMC certificate, won 1st prize in an essay competition during my A-Levels hosted by LSESU Economics society discussing ways that European policy makers can reduce reliance on Russian energy. Proficient in Stata (currently using in Econometrics projects), as well as Excel.

How I am developing my understanding:

Since I do not have direct experience as an intern in commodity trading, I have created a project using Excel where I compare the prices of commodities in 2024. I took this further by trying to dissect what major geopolitical events during the year led to the price of a certain commodity rising or falling. I compared commodities to each other to see if there is a relationship between them (combinations of brent and WTI with TTF gas and henry hub; gold, palladium, platinum, silver; wheat, soybean, corn; etc). I also compared them to key macro indicators, namely: strength of the dollar, as well as other notable currencies (Brazilian real relative to soybeans).

Created a PDF document compiling all of my understanding of physical commodity trading. How it works, different classifications of commodities, biggest players for each commodity, price drivers, how exchanges work, difference between hedging and speculating, the different types of derivatives (forward, futures, option, and swaps) and a examples of how they may work in the real world.

Why I am doing this:

The things which I have mentioned in the previous two paragraphs are my completed projects up to date. Since I have not secured a summer internship, I have compiled a list of almost 50 firms (based in London and Geneva) who trade commodities (physical and paper), and offer broking services for commodities. I have sent out an email to all of these firms with an attachment of my CV and the two projects I outlined above, asking if they have any internships available or shadowing opportunities.

Worse case scenario:

If this last attempt for experience this summer does not work out, I am looking towards opportunities after university. Many graduate programs will open from August 2025 through to February/March 2026 for a September 2026 start date.

Between now and August, what do you recommend that I do to build upon my current experience to stand out as a candidate. Should I go onto postgraduate at Bayes and do Energy, Trade, and Finance or Imperial and do Metals and Energy Finance? Is that even necessary?

If you have made it to the end, thank you for your time. Any tips/advice is welcome.",2,1741650313.0,Commodities,0,0.75,False

CHAPTER VII

I spawned into thin air, hovered for a moment, then rocketed toward the ground. Luckily, I hit a patch of grass. I rolled over onto my back, trying to adjust to the dim light of glowing green vines by blinking(it didn’t work).



The others sat up. So did I, walking to one of the vines to inspect it more closely. It was radioactive green, with darker veins and it was…pulsing? Then I noticed a symbol etched into the rock wall. Diana came over and saw it. There was a palm-shaped indent in the center of it. Out of curiosity, I put my hand into it. Suddenly the vines glowed a brighter green. 



The wall in front of me shook, then grinded open like a sliding double door. I was briefly flashbanged by daylight, but when it dimmed, I couldn’t do anything but catch my breath. We were standing on a outcrop above a mystical plain of floating stone spires, vibrant grasses and crystal lakes. There was no sun, only bioluminescent bushes and fiery birds soaring through the fresh, warm air. 



I stared at Diana. This place fit perfectly with her. Well, not necessarily her. The green person she had mentioned must have been from here. Except for mine apparently being Chaos, the others were still a mystery, though. I noticed Mark frown at something in the distance. I followed his gaze and saw… a house? Here? The others saw it as well.



“Well,” Emma said. “Should we go down there?” 

I shrugged. “Hey, it's the only civilization in sight. Why not?”

We slowly clambered down the rock face till we eventually reached the bottom. Now that we were closer to the building, I could tell it was one of those old Japanese houses with white walls and wooden columns. And there was someone on the front porch.



As we arrived, the person stood up and walked out to us. She was wearing a white Japanese robe, or kimono, and had her thick, dark brown hair tied in a loose ponytail. She looked like she was part asian, which explains the house’s style. She smiled faintly. “Hi. I'm Kira. since you’re here, I think we have a lot to talk about.” I frowned. “What?” She gestured to the house. “Come inside, I’ll introduce you to the others.”



CHAPTER VIII



Inside, there were three other people sitting around a traditional Japanese table. You know, the ones on the floor. Kira introduced them as Violet, Jasper and Skyla. Violet said she was the “host” of Spirit. I guess that made me the “host” of Chaos. Anyway, she had a grey long sleeve shirt on, etched with gold-colored runes and a long skirt with brown buckles around her waist. Her hair was a shade of lavender, with a black laurel wreath in it.



Jasper was the host of Instinct, and he had brown hair with a bit of green in it. He was wearing a dark green hoodie, dark brown cargo pants and a utility belt. Skyla was the Fire host(I figured that out by myself, she *totally* didn’t tell me), with orange hair, a white T-shirt and ripped black jeans. She also had black iron rings on her left index, middle and (duh) ring finger.



Emma cut to the chase. “So you said we had a lot to talk about?” Violet nodded to Jasper “Okay,” he said, standing up and coming round to us, “I'm assuming you know you’re hosting gods? That’s the only reason you can be here in the first place.”



“Yep, we know,” I said, “but most of us have no idea *what* god we have in our heads.”

“We’ll tell you later. Right now, you need to know why you’re here.”

“Okay.”

Jasper led us through the house, turning a few corners until we got to another balcony overlooking one of the lakes. I probably forgot to mention, the house was right on the edge of the water. It was all very nice, but… in the distance I could see a dark spot. Purple lightning shot out of black clouds. The ground was rocky and mutilated by explosions.



“That,” Violet said, “shouldn’t be there. At all. Never was supposed to.”

“Wh-what is it?” Diana asked.

“It’s the realm of Reality. A goddess who has one goal—destroy everything.”

“Unlike the other gods,” Kira piped in, “their goal is to keep the earth spinning relatively well.”

“But now they’re inside a bunch of sixteen year olds,” I said.

Which was exactly Reality’s plan. Keep the other gods who might stop her away.”



The crack of thunder from the other side of the world broke the conversation. “Anyway, we’ll talk tomorrow. No doubt you need some rest,” said Kira. I hadn’t realized how drained I was until she said that. “Yeah. okay,” I grumbled. “Do you have beds or something?”

“Tons of them,” Jasper said, “this house was built for this moment.”

We walked back into the building to sleep, leaving the dark void expanding in the dim light of glowing plants.

CHAPTER IX



I woke up early, feeling much more refreshed than yesterday. Wandering through the house, I found a door leading outside. I opened it, and all I saw was a courtyard of practice. There was a huge climbing wall set into a cliff, a boxing ring, those wooden poles with spinning sticks martial artists use and a few bow targets at the end of an obstacle course.



“I see you’ve found the Arena.” I turned around and saw Kira leaning against the wall with a cup of coffee. “How old are you?” I asked. “No one in my class drinks coffee.”

“I’m twenty-one. I’ve been here the longest.”

“Huh. What do you use the Arena for?”

“Training,” she said, pushing herself away from the wall, “It may look safe around here, but it’s most certainly not. We have to keep our skills up.”



A majestic screech emanated from above, and one of the flaming birds swooped down and landed on the roof opposite us. Kira peered up at it. “That’s Solanus. Skyla’s pet Ignahawk.”

“Ignahawk?”

“Those birds that were flying around when you came here. The only reason he’s not trying to kill us is because he knows humans are friends with her.”

“So why didn’t he kill Skyla when she got him?”

“He has a small part of Fire in him, just like Skyla, only her part is much bigger.”



My brain was working at about 10 frames per second because of all this stuff, so I just said, “Okay, but you said we would get explanations tomorrow. It’s tomorrow, isn’t it?”

“I suppose you’re right. Let’s wait until the rest wake up, though.”



A couple of hours later, we were all gathered around the main room. After Mark sat down, Violet began. “So, we’re all possessed, basically. From what I can tell by your guys' auras, Emma has Darkness, Jack has Chaos—” she looked at me warily— “Mark has Space, Mason has Water and Diana has Earth, whose realm we are in right now.”



Some of us looked at Diana like we should be praying to her or something. “Well,” Skyla said, “since that’s sorted, you’d better start training.”

“That fast? And training for what?” Mark asked.

“To eventually fight Reality, of course.”



CHAPTER X



We spent a couple of weeks training at Ēteru no Toride (The real name for the house, in Japanese it’s apparently, “Aether’s Keep,” and the reason it’s named that is Kira’s mom is from Japan). A lot happened, so I’ll just mainly focus on the training.



After the meeting, Jasper took us to the Arena and set up six different squares, one for each of us. I stepped into one, and after the others had done too, Jasper said, “Okay, all the gods have a signature weapon. You might already know, but just think of one appearing and it will.”

He nodded to Emma. “You first.” she seemed to think for a moment, then a flash of purple and she was holding two kunai, detailed with silver on their black blades. Then suddenly a target dummy charged her. Yes, a *target dummy.* She sidestepped and held out her blade so was positioned to cut the dummy’s neck. Momentum carried the target straight onto the blade, straw flying everywhere.



“Good. That was a reflex test,” Jasper said. “Now the rest of you.” 

We carried on maiming straw people. In case you were wondering, Diana had a leafy bow, Alex had a golden spear, Mason had a cyan trident and Mark had that space whip. Now it was my turn. I summoned my red greatsword, ready to slice whichever dummy came to life. Instead, they all did. A wave of half-living straw nearly overwhelmed me, but I ducked left and rolled to avoid them. My instincts took over, slash, roll, stab, feint, block, repeat.



A few minutes later, I was standing in the middle of a pile of dust and fabric, panting. “WHAT WAS THAT!?” I gasped to Jasper and the others, who must’ve came out while I was close to death. “Well, uh,” Violet said, “when the world was created, there were only four gods, Earth, Space, Chaos and Reality. The first three banded together so they could defend themselves against Reality. Chaos was, by far, the strongest of those three.”

“Okay, and?” 

“We had to up the difficulty for him.”



That didn’t seem fair. It's not like I was the strongest human here. That evening, I was sitting up against a post on the railing surrounding the Arena. Mark and Mason were talking on the opposite side, stuff that I couldn’t hear. Diana came up next to me and put her arms crossed on the banister. “I didn’t think it was fair ethier.”



“Thanks,” I mumbled. My arms still felt like they were on fire from that experience. She stared into the distance, probably thinking. “I overheard Kira talking with Violet. Apparently someone named Blake is coming here tomorrow.” I pondered that. There were going to be so many people here. Not like I'm bad at socializing, because I’ve been in high school. It’s just that most kids in high school aren’t possessed.



“Well,” I said, hopping off the railing, “see you tomorrow?”

“Duh. we’re in the same house.”

I chuckled. “Okay, bye, if you can even say that.”

“Bye,” Diana smiled back.

I walked into my room and collapsed on the bed. I stared at the ceiling for a while, hoping tomorrow's training wouldn’t be as devastating.



CHAPTER XI



Next morning, we were gathered by the lake. This time Kira was our instructor. “Okay, so. You know about the weapons. Now, this is probably your best tool.” She walked over to a big stone. Then, her hand erupted into lightning and she slammed it into the rock, sending splinters of it ricocheting across the water.



We all gawked at what Kira had just done. She pulled a stunned Mark up to where the rock used to be, but as she did, the shards regrouped and then the stone was whole again. Kira waved to Mark. “your turn.”

“Uh..” 

“All you need to do is think about what you want to use.”

He stared at his palm. As if by will(which it probably was, actually), it bursted into a galaxy-like smoke. Once Mark got over his shock, he hesitantly touched the slab of earth.



It disintegrated.

Like, not slowly-turn-to-dust disintegrated. The kind of disintegration where you blink and all that’s left is nothingness and a hole that goes right through the mountain behind it. Mark gaped at what his fingers had done. Kira looked at him, said, “Definitely Space,” and walked back into the house.



The rest of us looked at each other. “Well, Jack,” Emma said, “You wanna go next?” 

I shrugged. “Why not?” I walked up to the regenerating rock, observing it piece itself back together after being sent to the next reality. It wouldn’t be in this one for much longer, though.



 I channeled the thought of Chaos helping me blow stuff up. As expected, my fist broke out into scarlet flames that somehow weren’t hot. I punched the stone with all the strength I could muster in my puny sixteen-year-old self. Nothing happened. All that showed I had hit the rock was a red handprint.



Then, the ground rumbled. Red mist swirled into the valley, penetrating the slab, causing it to crack and reveal red light. Violet came out of the mansion. “What’s all thi—oh. Oh no. Hold on to something!” She shouted.



I dove for the stair railing, but it was too late. The stone exploded like a nuclear weapon, sending me flying across the realm. I soared through the air, only to smash into a floating pillar. Plummeting towards the ground and racked with pain, I could only listen to the sound my body made as it made contact before blacking out.



CHAPTER XII



I can remember wandering.



My eyes were hazy. The terrain was on fire. The air tasted ashy in my bruised throat. There was a man in front of me—wait. Man in front of me? I felt another wave of weakness, and I collapsed again. When I woke, I was propped up against a burnt tree. The outline of a man was on the other side of a small clearing.



My sight cleared, and the man was Chaos. “What are you doing here?” I mumbled. He turned to face me, his red eyes burning into my brain. “You don’t have the right to say that, seeing this is my realm.”

“*Your* realm?”

“Of course,” he said, gesturing to the destruction around us, “does this look like something Ere-Tai would like?”

“Who’s Ere-Tai?” I asked.

“Ah, my apologies. You don’t know the First Speech yet. Ere-Tai is Earth’s real name.”



I thought about that. There was a whole language in this place? What else didn’t I know? Chaos broke the silence. “Your—or my—power is advancing more rapidly than I’ve ever seen. No one else has sent themselves flying on the third day.”

“Hold up. This whole thing has happened before?”

“Why, yes. Reality, The Unfathomed One, is always trying to destroy something. The last time, she was going for your sun.” He chuckled. “And the time before that, your solar system. Her standards are dropping.”



“How did no one notice?” I said. Chaos looked at an erupting volcano. “Most humans have always been ignorant. And besides, we made ourselves silent and invisible.” he brushed off the ash that had been settling on his armor. “Anyway, you should be going back to Ēteru no Toride. They’ll be worried by now, seeing you’ve been gone for five days.”

“What!?”

“Mmm. I’ll send you back now. Next time, touch the rock more lightly.” He winked, and crimson smoke enveloped me.



CHAPTER XIII



I dropped out of the smoke onto a ridge. I couldn’t see the house, but it had to be close. I started down the slope, and came into a dense grove of glowing trees. As I walked through it, I noticed just how magnificent they were up close. As I was transfixed by them, Mason burst into the glade. His clothes were torched and his skin was cut and bruised in places.



“Jack!” he panted. “Where were you?” 

“Being blown to the other side of the world, you?”

“Anyway, we need you! Ēteru no Toride’s on fire!”

“What!?” I rushed through the underbrush, desperate to get back now. When we got out of the woods, I was stunned. The whole place was really burning down. The others were outside fighting off these… things. I summoned my sword, but I also thought *what the hell, give me some armor too.* 



Turns out that worked. Red armor plates folded around me, encasing me in a shield of pure… *hey Chaos, what’s this made of?*

*Arkonite,* he replied. *Stronger than any ore from your Earth. And your sword’s name is the Redrender, in case you were wondering.*



With that now known, I charged down the hill, energy-punching the ground to launch me there faster. I landed in the middle of a group of those things. Now that I could see them more clearly, I was horrified. They were like vicious ghosts, all black with a maw of sharp teeth. One’s skeletal arms reached out to grab me. I slashed them off and dove out of the circle of enemies.



Kira was fighting off some as well. I leapt to help her, cutting through the ghouls like a wave washing away sand. Kira had a deep gash on her arm, and yet she was still fighting. “What are these things?” I asked, fending off one’s bite.



“Kama-Nal. Realities weakest servants,” she heaved. 

“*Weakest?*”

She nodded. “You don’t want to meet the strongest.”

Jasper came spinning through the group. He hit a wall and went straight through it. Diana dove after him, wielding her bow. While I was distracted by that, a Kama-Nal hit me directly in the head. I stabbed it, but the damage was done. Something warm and red dripped down my forehead. Blood. I felt dizzy, my eyesight getting fuzzy again.



Emma screamed something I couldn’t hear. I fell to the ground, feeling my breath get heavier. Kira pulled me out of the fight and into one of the only unburnt rooms left. Nearly everyone was at the door, holding the enemy back. Diana was at my side now. She put her hand on my forehead, trying to heal it with her powers. She pulled it back, tears streaming down her face. She said something inaudible to Kira. Then it went black.



CHAPTER XIV



I was in a dark cave now. Chaos was at the other end, tending a fire. “A-am I dead?” I asked. 

“Not quite. But I will have to make this quick,” he said. “Almost all my hosts have been in this situation before—about to die. I told them my power could easily save them, But they were too weak and stubborn. Are you?”

“I'm just sixteen,” I mumbled. “I shouldn’t even be here.”

“You, Jack Elbrus,” he said, poking me in the chest, “are weak? The only person who has flung themselves to the edge of this world, is *weak?*”



Now he was insulting me. Even if I was weak, I hated being ridiculed. I stood up. “Maybe you're the one who’s weak! You hide behind me, even though you’re supposedly a god!” He looked satisfied. “Well done. You are now the first one to talk back to me, and by that, the first one with the guts to live.” He patted me on the shoulder. “Now, you’d better get back before they’re all slaughtered.” I felt a wrenching feeling in my abdomen, pulling me out of the cave.



I jolted up, followed by Diana tackling me in a hug. She sniffled. “Don’t *ever* do that again.”

I saluted her. “Yes, ma’am.” I stood up. “Now, where are those idiots who hit me? ‘Cause I’m hitting them back.”



I energy-bursted out of the room, smashing through a Kama-Nal and landing on the lakeshore. I felt reinvigorated, like I could do anything. The skeletal ghouls came at me hard and fast, with me dodging all of their swipes and hacking them to pieces. I even used the punch on some.



Suddenly, a roar echoed through the landscape. A huge beast smashed down a burning wall, snorting through its metal armor. It turned to face me, its purple eyes boring into my soul. A guy who I'd never seen before came up next to me. “That would be what we call a Traibor,” he said. 



“Who are you?” I asked. He was wearing a dark green hoodie, except it looked like a trench coat as well, if that’s even possible. His hair hung over one yellow eye like an emo dude. “The name’s Blake,” he said, “the element’s Death. I came here just after Kira did.” The Traibor grunted, pawing the ground.



“Get ready,” Blake said, “It’s about to charge.” He was right. It teared towards us, its bellow making my bones shiver. I dashed out of the way, taking a slash at its armor that should’ve killed it, but my sword just bounced off.



The Traibor wheeled around, its maw glowing violet with energy. Then, with a shudder, it launched a blast of it at me and Blake. I barely had time to dive to the side. Blake, however, stood his ground, deflecting the attack off a black scythe dripping with what looked like pure plague. The animal huffed, like, *Death not dead?* 



Blake repositioned himself. Then, he made a strange gesture with his hands, kind of like the fingertips-together-business gesture, but more powerful and ancient. A dark mist rolled over the area. The Traibor backed up as Blake muttered, *Final Call of Death: All Must End.* A giant skeleton made of green smoke erupted out of the ground, bringing a massive axe down on the Traibor, instantly disintegrating it. 



The mist dissipated. I came up to Blake. “Uh, what… was that, exactly?” He moved his hair back to its place over his eye. “Every element has some kind of really strong attack. You’ll learn yours eventually.” he yawned. “Using them makes you tired, though.”

“Huh. Well, the Kama-Nal are still here. ‘Got enough energy to help?” I said.

Blake hefted his scythe. “Until Death.”

“*Ha, ha.”*



CHAPTER XV



A few hours later, all of Reality's goons were dead or had been driven away. Ēteru no Toride had taken a beating in terms of structural integrity, but nothing a bunch of gods and high-schoolers can’t fix. While everyone was repairing the walls, me and Violet got the task of fixing the watchtower, which had been hit and fell over.



Violet used her Spirit-ey stuff to lift blocks with telekinesis, but I had to manually lift them. When we were done, my arms felt like lead. I flopped down on my bed, absolutely exhausted. It doesn’t take long to fall asleep when you’ve done something like that. I still woke up in the middle of the night, though.



I went outside on the balcony, expecting no one to even be awake, but Mason was there.

I leaned over the railing with him. “So,” he said, “This has been constructive learning.”

“So right. Who needs school and college?” I replied, smirking. 

“You think we’ll ever go back?”

I considered that. “Probably, if we can kill a goddess fast enough.”



Solanus came out of nowhere and landed on one of the chairs. “CRAWWW!” I looked at him, then at Mason “Do you want to go back?” 

“Now that you say that, I might not.”

I fistbumped him. Even though we were in a different world, we were still best friends.



We chatted for a while, mostly about the cool things we could do with our respective gods. I couldn’t remember how much time had gone by, but it must’ve been around two in the morning when something happened. I looked across the lake, taking in its magnificence, when I spotted a figure. He was far away, but I could make out the black mist circling him.



Then suddenly, he wasn’t there. I jumped back “Mason, did you see that?”

“Yeah. Not good.”

I heard footsteps behind us, and reeled around, swinging my sword at the person who had come up behind us. “Woah!” Kira said, taking a step back. “You good?” I pointed over the lake. “Someones out there.”



Kira scanned the landscape. “That guy?” she said, looking at a mountaintop. I followed her gaze. “Yeah. Him.” Now that he was closer, I could see he was wearing a hood and blindfold of fabric strips. Rouge bits of it fluttered in the wind and covered his mouth, but I got the feeling I didn’t want to see that mouth. His dark cloak was billowing along with the long strips. In short, not very friendly.



He brought his hands out in front of him, igniting them with purple flames. Solanus cawed and flew away. I wish I could’ve done that, because the figure threw the flames at us. They hit the floor, looking not super dangerous, but Kira knew otherwise. “Run!” she screamed. I made a desperate dash for the doorway, but then the flames blazed brighter and detonated, making me hit my head against the wall.



*Not again,* I thought, then blacked out, knowing full well Reality’s strongest servant was here.



And he wouldn’t stop until we were all dead.

Now one cup of coffee gives me uncomfortable anxiety. Caffeine used to fuel my vacations, but on my last trip to Europe in October 2024, I couldn't handle *one* cup in the morning.

I was fine on my trip in 2023.

My tolerance doesn't appear to be going back to normal either. I have switched to Green Tea. My anxiety is especially bad in the morning though. I suspect the anxiety is related to cummulative damage to my digestive system. I have bad acid reflux and can't handle red meat or beer any longer either. My body just reads the stimulant as a threat.

Its strange watching people in their 70's drinking multiple cups of coffee, like it's nothing. I can't even handle one cup. 

I'm just curious if others have had a similar experience and whether they somehow got over it (I'm not optimistic).

I wanted to ask for some feedback on a “tea” I make and drink during my fasting window. I do ADF/3x 36h fasts weekly. I’m in my 3rd week and it’s become quite… easy. I really enjoy this schedule and truthfully never thought I would!

Any who, I put tea in quotes because I do not use tea leaves. It is a mix of: cinnamon bark, elderflowers, fenugreek, rosehips, chamomile flowers, cardamom, and dandelion root. I steep 2 Tbsp of the mix with 32oz of hot water and drink maybe 3hrs later with ice. I do this twice on my fasting days (MWF) and sip on this after my black coffee until bed time. 

Would anyone consider this a break of fast? I read - lies - listened to Obesity Code and I know he mentions non-tea-teas, but I’m unsure if I completely understood whether or not he considered this breaking a fast. I also tried to listen to Megan Ramos’s book, but I don’t think she stated specifically either. I don’t think it’s breaking my fast (or ultimately impacting my insulin levels), but would love the input from others. 

I appreciate you! Thanks!!

1j8d3s7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Historical_King8755/comments/1j8d3s7/my_wife_cheated_on_me_part_one/,My wife cheated on me / part one,"This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I’m going to be using different names and I will not be revealing anyone’s identities here. For privacy reasons.

My wife is 26 and he is 55.

So the characters of the story is me being the husband who was cheated on. My wife is my wife.
The guy is the person who cheated on his own wife to have mine. And my son, which is the victim of this because now his life is different.

I first met my wife back in 2019 and we quickly got married in 2020. We had a really good life together for about one year. My wife is Chinese Indonesian and I am Caucasian Australian.

In 2022, we had a child together.

After about one year, she started getting more demanding and isolating me from my family and friends. 

She always complained that I never made enough money. and that I spent too much when I really didn’t she was just so stingy with money.

For example, she would never let me buy proper new shoes like one hundred dollars to one fifty dollars minimum because I need orthotics.

I only went to the dentist once when I was married to her because she said every six months is too expensive.

I finally convinced her to let me get my car serviced.

I mentioned before she’s from Indonesia. Well she came to Australia. I fell in love with her. Now that’s stupid. I paid for her PR. I gave her driving lessons brought her a car. I paid her way so she could live in this country without worrying about anything.

And she still complained I didn’t make enough money. And I even did all this with savings no debt.

I work a simple job 9 to 5. I’m not going to tell you where because that’s a privacy breach but just know the salary isn’t high or low. It’s alright.

She got a job she’s had jobs before, but she’s got anger management problems and she can’t keep them for a long time. But she managed to get a job pretty much immediately. She started talking to this guy. This all happened in June 2024.

I’m sorry for the information being all over the place, but I just have to get this story down before I cannot anymore.

She started coming home later Not coming home directly after work. She will tell me she’s having coffee with a coworker. At first. I said yes because it’s fine. It’s just coffee. Coffee turned into dinner dates. Coffee turned into her spending two hours after I come home with this guy.

I even confronted her about this a few times and she said it’s just a friend. Why can’t I have friends? I agreed you can have friends but this is getting too close.

One time she told me she was going out after I came home from work and she was gone till about 930. I then confronted her about it and she said she saw the same guy. She went to coffee with. She told him that they can’t continue their relationship because she’s got a husband.

And I believed it foolishly. Not two days later I find her behaviour real suspicious. Now I’ve got a IT background so I’m really good with technology and social hacking. so I figured out her password because she changed it. And I got evidence of her emotionally cheating on me. I had this all about 2 to 3 weeks before I acted. I recorded it with my phone.

As soon as I found this out, I rang my best mate and I told him what’s going on exactly and then from that moment I stopped having sex with her completely because I didn’t know if she was tainted by another man seed. 

My best mate prevented me from punching holes in walls so angry.

In September last year 2024, she finally lost her ability to hide her affair from me. She told me one day come home straight away so I can go to work.

So I drove around the back roads to the house that we rented thank goodness we rented Not brought. I found his car. 

His car was parked in front of my wife’s car. I was furious. I stormed up to the car once I found out that she wasn’t home I texted her. She said she’s coming home soon.

I pulled up my car angrily on the other side of the road. I then opened her car door demanded my son told her off for not feeding him because it was 6 pm and he should’ve had dinner by now. And I refuse to shake his hand.

After that, I left and I didn’t return to the house to live again.

Stupidly, I did not take my money out of the bank she cleaned me out me $800. I won’t tell you how much was in the joint savings a year salary for a  mid high -paid person.

I’m still fighting to get Access to my son and Access to half that money back.

And now she’s engaged with the guy who broke my family apart. Well, to be fair he didn’t do all the work she did half the work as well.

In my opinion, I’m not angry, but I think they do deserve each other. To cheaters to Home wreckers.

I forgot to mention this earlier my wife is 26 and he is 55.

I’m going to divorce her in September 2025. We are separated for seven months now. Australia is a no-fault state so that makes things easier I suppose.

As soon as I came back, I went to live with my parents again. I said sorry to all my friends and family who she wrong and alienated me from.

Everyone she ever wrong online I said sorry to that I could find.

Now go back to church regularly I’m back with the community and my mental health is really improved.

She made me feel like rubbish, sorry for swearing, but it’s necessary. She made me feel worthless and I even thought about ending it twice. I didn’t do it obviously because I’m still around for my son.

Now feel happier mental health health, happier and my mental health is great now.  I’m physically better mentally spiritually and physically again. I feel strong.

I had to take a week and a half off work to get my life back together again.

I just feel disgusted that someone I trusted could do that to me. And now I only see my son maybe 4 to 6 hours a month. She is completely ignoring my rights to see my own child.

I’m going to try to fight her, but Call is expensive but I need to fight her so I’m probably gonna go to court to fight her to get Access to my son and the money she took.

I had to go to the police things back because she wouldn’t give anything to me. My dad and my uncle helped me out as well. She lied to the police and told them I was trying to break in when I wasn’t.

She occasionally says to me and cries to me and tries to win me back, but I’m not ever gonna get back with someone who’s been tainted by someone else and lied to me.

Once a cheater, always a cheater.

I believe I handled myself well through this ordeal because I never hurt anyone or punched the guy. Even though I want to, I will not because I’ll be the bigger person.

I’m still suffering financially after what she did to me. I now still believe in marriage but I’m really cautious and I don’t think I will get remarried unless it’s the right person.

Bit stupid of me because we only dated for about less than a year six months before we got married. I was young and I was 24 years old.

And now I’m 30 and I’ve got some debts because of what she did. I think she only likes him because he’s rich. And I think he likes her because she’s a young Asian woman and he wants someone to look after him in his old age.

I will give you some more updates on this later when they come. 

Thanks for listening to my story. Stay trained for part two.

1j8d2g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1j8d2g7/am_i_wrong_for_wanting_to_distance_myself_from/,Am I wrong for wanting to distance myself from family??,"This might be long and a little all over the place but bear with me. For context, I am in my early 20's, and my family/siblings are early 30's.

Keep all this in mind before reading ahead; my family is controlling and wants everything their way or no way, things get ran through my brother and if it doesn’t make them happy it’s not right. Also everyone is always pleasing the decisions of my mom to satisfy her and plays victim by saying we don’t understand her feelings

To start this all happened at the start of 2023, so it's been a bit. In the beginning of 2023, I started talking to this guy I went to high school with but then we were never really close but knew of each other. At the start of this, he was 23 (now 25) and I was 20 (now 22 turning 23 in october). We had started talking and getting to know each other which was nice at the start until family got involved...

We got to talking started to know each other and all then we eventually started dating. Keep in mind I am in college at this time so of course I am going to doing college stuff lol. To start I had been seeing him for around 2 months just being friends and seeing where things go until i started to get questioned by my brother. Lets call him George, at the time he was 27 (29 now) got involved by asking me why i was going to this certain place a lot. He had my location for a while as any sibling would but I never would have thought it would be used to see where I was going being the age I was. I ended up lying as to where because I didnt want him in my business right away and I didn't want to share that I was with someone just yet because it was too soon and I know how my family is when meeting someone. They are very judgmental right off the bat without knowing them. 

So eventually it had gotten out of control when one day my bf and I went on a night walk in our hometown street where there was a bunch of small coffee shops, bars, etc, then we ended up passing by the gym that my brother was in at the time and he randomly texted me saying ""you did not just walk by me and not say hi""... excuse me, I am not going to go into the gym to interrupt your workout. So we then continued walking to mind our own business then this happened… tell me why he instantly got in his car and DROVE UP ON US!!! Literally not even 5 minutes of seeing him he was already right there. Mind you this was the first time he’s ever seen my bf so obviously I was a bit nervous and so was he. George ended up starting conversation by literally saying “who the f*** are you” right off the bat!!! I was not expecting that at all but being nice and very caught off guard my bf introduced himself then my brother started questioning him about where he worked, how long he’s worked there and more. After that happened we just continued our walk and i instantly apologized because like what was that?! It then continues, I ended up going to my brothers and didn’t think anything of it right? Well I was wrong he found just the right moment to ask me these questions about who I was seeing and everything but me I’m such a big people please I told him just someone because I felt like I needed to give an answer but that was the worst mistake. He took that as a lead to start “investigating” him because a few months later he knew where he lived, what apartment number and what apartment building he was in but I will come back to that, crazy I know!!

After that encounter of seeing him on the walk everything was ok until George started to do some digging into my bfs past and everything which I still question myself how he knew everything but never got a clear answer. Anyway, he started telling me he was a bad person, he burned bridges with many people and the list goes on even to call him a narcissist which I don’t see. After he told me all that I started to second guess myself who this person was and everything but I just let time tell but I should’ve stopped having him get involved right there and then and I unfortunately didn’t. It got to the point where we ended up actually breaking up because my brother told me to and I listened. We ended up ending things and it hurt so much that when we did we couldn’t believe it happened because I decided to listen to my brother. I ended it and then a month later or so after we got back together because it wasn’t right to end things because someone told me to. Getting back together was what fueled the situation even more!! It got to be where my mom got involved and my brother’s fiancé let’s call her Marie (22 at the time 25 now). Don’t get me started on her lol. Shes been around for a while since her and my brother have been together for 8 years getting married this summer. 

Both my mom and his fiancé got involved because they were getting told what was happening from my brother. Keep this in mind, this has all been happening while being a full time college student at a new school and first semester since I transferred. As it went on I was struggling with school because I was getting calls and texts left and right from absolutely everyone saying how I wrong in the situation, that I was with the wrong person and all that. Remember when I said I didn’t want my around because it was too soon? Well they decided to take it into their own hands to deal with by saying I couldn’t see him until he came around my family but I say I wasn’t comfortable enough yet because we were still getting to know each other and that was within the first 2 months of us seeing each other. I told them I wasn’t ready and they said it wasn’t my choice. So here comes more. I stayed the night at my bfs for the weekend because we just wanted to have a night together right, tell me why I got to my house and my brother was there and approached us AGAIN!! He told my bf he wanted to talked he asked about what and all he was it’s personal, and then he told ME to go inside as if I did something wrong. They were talking for about 3 hours and I know nothing about what they talked about because I never got told other than my bf saying to give us at least 3 months and he would but then it took a turn because my brother decided to do more…..

He got my mom involved by telling her what I was doing where I was going absolutely everything!! Then I started getting calls and texts from my mom saying all sorts of stuff to where it drained me so bad it affected my schooling that I had to take a gap year. Throughout it all my bf eventually met my sister who I’m living with (mom and dad I don’t live with) dad lives out of the country, mom moved down there and visits here. I’ve been living with my sister for a few years so when it comes to me leaving the house to go anywhere I tell her but for them it’s not good enough, I get told “she’s not your mom, I am” and it’s been like that sense. Back to how they got involved. So my brother goes and tells me mom about the concerns he has, she then comes to tell me about stuff and I try explaining my part but no she takes his side and blames me and my bf for everything going on. They said he had to meet a sibling of mine and he met my sister and her fiancé right? Tell me why when they get asked about him they say absolutely nothing to my mom of how he is as a person, then he ended up coming over for dinner just to get to know them a little more and even then they didn’t make conversation with him. He was the one asking questions and after dinner they proceeded to go to their room and not interact with him so that’s twice now that he’s tried to get to know some family, but guess what….. that wasn’t enough!!🤦🏽‍♀️ I had numerous conversations with my family about how they were treating me and him but they didn’t care. He went as far as talking to my brothers fiancé Marie about how my family was to get to know them even more since at that time she would’ve been with my brother for 6 years so she’s been around. THIS is where everything took a turn and went even more downhill from here. We went to a coffee shop, her, me and my bf talked about my family he asked questions and she agreed with almost everything he had said but then when she went back home she told my brother the complete opposite saying that my bf brainwashed her with what he said and we were talking for about 2 hours. How in the world can you do that in 2 hours?!!!! At this point my bf and I were very much to the point where we were going to end things completely and not talk to each other anymore because it was driving us apart more and more but we stuck it through and kept talking. While in the mix of everything I had met his mom and went over a few times but it wasn’t until that also became an issue because they thought he didn’t want to come around my family and I was choosing him over them but I wasn’t. Every conversation I had with my family was all negative it got to the point where I got told I was failing them as a daughter and that I was like a little dog listening to its owner. They said that because whenever he came to pick me up he wouldn’t come to the door, i would just go outside. They called me names, saying I was just going there to do the “thing” which was not the case. I would go with him because I wasn’t around them and felt at peace which they had a problem with

This next part is when my mom came home to see us and to meet my bf because she didn’t want to do it over FaceTime but said she wanted to meet him. She asked about going to dinner I said it was fine but my bf was hesitant because of what’s been happening but he went anyway. I asked her if it could just be us and her but guess who showed up… my brother. As soon as he walked through the door I knew it was over. My mom asked us what was going on so we were explaining it to her but George was budding in every chance he got and the conversation went nowhere because they made me cry and at the very end my brother called my bf a pos and we left. I felt so bad that the car ride back was complete silence and when I hugged my bf he started crying saying “I tried everything” every since then he has not see my family besides this one last time. The final time he had seen them was when George and my mom followed us to his mom’s house!! Now let me explain. Him and I had ended up going to his moms for dinner since invited us, while I was there my mom texted me saying “wow I come all the way here just for you to go there” at the time it hurt that she said that looking at it now it was to make me feel bad. But back to what happened. We had left his moms after dinner and we started driving, tell me why we ended up at the same intersection as my brother and mom. My bf kept driving and we didn’t think anything of it until the car kept getting closer and closer, then we instantly knew we were being followed so we decided to go back to his moms. During that the cops got called because of the previous events so we eventually got back and they told us they were just getting gas!! Like no and they said they just wanted to talk but it was 9 at night which I then said was late and it could be another day. Now that was the very last time he had seen my mom and brother and same with the rest of my family. My other siblings weren’t involved so they aren’t mentioned

Last part. Ever since then my family hasn’t approved of him and he wants nothing to do with my family ever again even it leads to him and I being together in the future with a family of our own. Now I’m stuck to where I cut them off or keep them a distance. I’m a very family oriented person but true colors showed within the last few years of if it’s not about them they don’t care and will do anything they can to make it harder.

1j8d254,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1j8d254/feeling_stuck/,Feeling Stuck,"Hi all, I’m a 24-year-old consultant based in Europe.

I’ve been working at a pharma/biotech consulting firm for the past couple of years. I started as an entry-level analyst and was promoted after two years. Lately, though, I’ve been questioning whether this job and firm are still right for me:

1.	⁠⁠⁠⁠Feeling Isolated and Disconnected

Most clients are in the US since the EU offices are still new. As a result I often work on US-based projects with EU hours, which means long days (10–12 hours) behind a screen, waiting for feedback from US-based teams/managers and partners. Even when I go to the office, I’m stuck on calls with US colleagues, so face-to-face interaction is rare. The lack of in-person collaboration—grabbing coffee, brainstorming as a team—has really hurt my motivation and productivity compared to when I’ve worked with local colleagues.

2.	Questioning the value of work

The work used to feel strategic and meaningful. Now I realize it’s mostly glorified (and expensive) market research with questionable data and conclusions dressed up as “strategic recommendations.” What once felt impactful now feels hollow.

3.	Frustration with the Process

The hypocrisy on some projects is hard to ignore. I’ve been working non-stop with a partner who’s is revered by all, but behind the scenes, the data is often manipulated to fit the narrative. Forecasts from market research are too low and the client’s job is on the line? Just “strategically” tweak the model to inflate revenue projections. But miss a footnote on a draft slide? Prepare to be dragged through endless revisions. It feels like we’re adding fake value to cover up the fact that the work itself isn’t delivering real insights and is mostly overpriced and unreliable market research

4.	Poor Exit Opportunities

Good exits from this office have been rare. I suspect it’s partly the job market and slower hiring cycles in Europe, but I also think working with US-based clients limits opportunities. Minimal client interaction, no site visits, and weak networking chances with local clients make it hard to transition to a good role in Europe. Since my long-term plan is to exit, I’m questioning whether staying makes sense.

Despite all this, I’ve consistently gotten strong reviews and am on track for another promotion

A month ago, something changed. I suddenly went from managing 12-hour days and producing good work to feeling mentally drained and slow. Tasks that were once easy now take twice as long, and I am making mistakes and being inconclusive. It feels like I can’t even put together a decent slide anymore. I’ve tried compensating by working longer hours, but that’s only made things worse. My anxiety has spiked—I’m constantly stressed, to the points where I start sweating randomly and panicking before calls.

I feel stuck in a job the value of which I am seriously debating and I’m starting to fall behind. I’m not sure what to do next: •	A) Stay and try to turn things around. •	B) Stay in consulting but to to a firm working on projects I’d enjoy more (e.g., corporate strategy). •	C) Try to lateral into industry —but with the current market, that feels unlikely.

Has anyone been through something similar? Any insights would be really helpful.",3,1741650043.0,consulting,1,1.0,False

**Chinese AI agent Manus AI is challenging OpenAI, particularly in autonomous task execution.Stanford has made a breakthrough using AI to target obesity treatment, potentially reducing side effects.** **Microsoft is exploring alternative AI partnerships to reduce dependence on OpenAI, signalling growing competition.** **Furthermore, AI is impacting various sectors, from religious services and dating apps, to wildlife identification, as well as raising questions about labour practices and ethical oversight in the field.**

# 🚀Manus AI vs OpenAI's GPT operator

Manus AI, China's fully autonomous AI agent, is being compared against OpenAI’s GPT Operator in terms of reasoning, adaptability, and real-world applications.

# Who is winning the autonomous execution race?



# Manus AI: The Powerhouse

  
**Autonomous Execution**: Manus AI takes the lead with its ability to execute tasks independently, from report writing to website deployment

**Web Navigation**: It seamlessly browses live web pages and creates downloadable files, hosting outputs on URLs

**Multi-Modal Capabilities**: Integrates text, image, and code processing for complex tasks

# ChatGPT Operator: The Assistant

Provides suggestions rather than autonomously completing tasks, which can be limiting for complex workflows

Offers slower web navigation with occasional platform access issues

# Choose Your Tool Wisely

* Manus AI is ideal for users seeking autonomous execution and advanced tool integration
* ChatGPT Operator is better suited for simpler browser-based tasks

**What this means:** As AI agents become more autonomous, the competition between Western and Chinese AI models is heating up, raising questions about efficiency, security, and global AI leadership. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/03/10](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211)\]

* BRP targets specific brain regions instead of affecting multiple organs, potentially avoiding common Ozempic side effects like nausea and muscle loss.
* In animal tests, a single dose of BRP cut food intake by half in both mice and minipigs, with obese mice losing significant fat over two weeks of treatment.
* Stanford's ""Peptide Predictor"" AI system sifted through 20,000 human genes, analyzing thousands of potential candidates, to find the natural molecule.
* A company has already been created to begin human trials, with researcher Katrin Svensson suggesting that BRP could revolutionize weight loss treatment.

Stanford researchers have developed an AI-driven approach to obesity treatment that personalizes weight loss strategies based on metabolic data and behavioral analysis.

Thoughts/feedback welcome :) (p.s. I realized I didn't totally follow the prompt correctly but w/e),"**Complete this sentence three times: ""The truth is...""**  
  
**For example: The truth is my father lied. The truth is the wrong parent died. The truth is I'm not sure I believe in romantic love anymore.**

***Please keep this under 500 words. The brevity will help you focus your work.***

“The truth is,” I said to my housemate, Amy, “I’m just way too horny to be on the asexual spectrum, and apparently demisexuality is on the asexual spectrum, so I don’t think I can really qualify as demi, despite all of the other aspects of it describing me.”

Amy and I do this most mornings: pontificate about whatever-life-thing while sitting in rocking chairs on our Berkeley California porch as I drink my coffee. As a PhD student in neuroscience up the street at Cal, Amy is perfect for this. She’s the human embodiment of a curious lab rat, always scurrying around with a book, a snack, and a question. 

That morning, we were talking about sexuality, demisexuality specifically. Demisexuals don’t experience sexual attraction towards a person until they have an emotional connection with said person. This is distinctly unique from the very common human experience of simply preferring a connection with someone before having sex. 

“Actually!” Amy responded, “Asexuality doesn’t have much to do with libido. It’s more about attraction to the human body. So a person on the asexual spectrum might have a very high libido, but be more inclined towards tentacle-porn than people-porn.”

Oh my god. 

I paused in my rocking chair, mid coffee sip. 

I was fantasizing about tentacles while falling asleep just last week!

The truth is, despite always having found that demisexuality describes me quite well (minus that asexuality detail), I always thought it was a little ridiculous. Sure, I don’t experience sexual attraction towards anybody until I have an emotional connection with them. But that seemed more likely a symptom of the everyday traumas that come with living as a woman in society, not because of a normal, default brain setting. 

The tentacles, though. That was… really specific. What the hell.

The sun peeked over the houses across the street, showering Amy and me in sweet, California warmth. I sat back in my rocking chair, spiritually on the third panel of the brain exploding meme, the sudden and unexpected comfort of potentially having a puzzle piece of a word to describe myself. A lifetime of feeling wildly incompatible with conventional dating norms, explained. The weird, erotic ode to the crab that I wrote last month, explained. The fact that I once climaxed to the idea of a tree… explained. 

I fantasize about people, sure. But it’s all about the vibe between us: the feeling of being overwhelmed. Exalted. Overcome. Cared for. Does the person I’m with in my mind have abs? Couldn’t tell ya.

The truth is, I updated my dating profile that night. Demisexual.

So my dog got sprayed by a skunk last night. My bf let her come into the house before she was cleaned and omg it smells bad. 
Him: “I didn’t know she got sprayed.” 
I was coming out  of the bathroom when I see her by the doggy gate . She got sprayed in the face, so she’s spitting out the spray that got in her mouth all over the floor! My bf takes her to give her a bath and then sees afterwards that you should wipe them down first before adding any water 🤦🏻‍♀️ (so many things could have been differently) I called the ER vet and was told she should be ok. 

1. I turned on backyard honeysuckle. When a backup happened in laundry room it was a beast. Yeah it helped but I prob needed 5 of them.

2. Lavender expresso: Bf read coffee grounds eats up smell. He grinds up old beans and I grabbed the only coffee candle I have and the spray. This candle is weak in living space but worked in our room. I sprayed the area too. 

3. Fresh cut lilacs: FOLKS!! My bf went to the store to grab stuff to make a paste for the smell and didn’t change!! I was busy clean in the floor and didn’t notice he didn’t change.My car smelled like skunk so I bombed it with fresh cut lilacs room spray and the car fragrance. It’s helped with the smell. Like why didn’t he change 😭🤦🏻‍♀️ 

4.Musk is an odor eater when it comes to smelly dog feet and smelly cats. It was not up to task for skunk, but it tried 😅

5.Now why is Lammy here?? You thought bf driving to store in clothes was bad. He changed to give my dog a bath and and and!!! He slept in the clothes!!!! I had to wash all the sheets. Lammy is on my bed with a Snoopy throw pillow and they both stunk like skunk! I threw them in the dryer with a dryer sheet and smell went away.  I stayed up to keep an eye on my dog and thought he changed into different sleeping clothes. 

“I hate it here.” 😅 ( Any tips on how to remove baking soda chalkiness or skunk out of floors is greatly appreciated!) I am about to bust out the fresh cut lilac candle since I’m at the end of backyard honeysuckle. Hopefully no one else is ever in this situation but if you are, keep these scents on hand for an emergency!

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

An appropriate approach may be a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined the \`gestalts",1,1741649408.0,SpiritualAwakening,0,1.0,False

1.       When all else fails… take ‘em to church seems to be Carlin’s motto.  She started the week filming during worship service and we see Layla, at 5 years old, being held by the preacher’s wife.  Holding Layla while Zade walks seems to be the new normal, and we see it a lot this week.  The Hill family is in town to take advantage of some child exploitation in a different setting, and that means Layla has to give up her room and sleep on a tiny cot in the corner of her parent’s room.  Layla really needs to start a kid union and be the Bethenny Frankel of the preschool set.  She could truly cause a “Reality Reckoning”.  Carlin and the Sophia chick have a week to work out, play games and shop together, but the kids still have to show up for work.  This week that means Zade is parked in front of the camera and Carlin tells him to “talk to the people”…she continues to use baby talk when conversing with him and Zade tells us there is “bowbow in bowbow”.  Carlin grins all over herself and tells us he really means “baby in belly”.  Bless it.  Zade continues to screw up Carlin’s aesthetic by saying he wants a Mickey Mouse baby.  If he only knew that is basically what he’s getting-an overexposed cartoon character that is commercialized to the hilt. Carlin is back to promoting the Boutique heavily, though she still isn’t wearing that fast fashion in real life.  Remember the story from a few months ago where Layla admitted to taking toys and hiding them behind the bean bag?  Well, it has taken a while for her to learn her lines to act that whole thing out, but she finally nailed it and it was cameras up for a reel showing Layla digging toys out from her special hiding spot.  There were piles of toys and junk, most unopened and still in the package.  That hiding spot is Layla’s bank, and those piles of junk are her paychecks that she deposits back there. No wonder a simple stuffed animal doesn’t impress her.  She has an entire Dollar Store in the bonus room.  In true diva fashion, Layla agrees to part with only one small rattle.  In the weekly vlog we see Evan and Taylor complimenting each other on their weight and sitting together for a movie night, just like true girlfriends do.  Evan tells us we haven’t seen a lot of the pregnancy and that feels like gaslighting.  They take us back to early February where Carlin explains in gory detail her personal business.  The words “spotting”, “gushing”, and “blood” are used way too many times.  Basically, she had a hemorrhage in her uterus and the doctor wanted her to take it easy.  Spoiler alert: she is not taking it easy.  We do see a glimpse into their relationship when Evan tells us he was “poo poo’ing” Carlin’s fears and she tells him that he needs to shut up and listen to her when she just needs to vent.  She asks 57 times if she has a bump yet, cries in the car while preaching to her audience about faith and wraps it up by using baby talk to communicate with her children.  The weekend finds them in a strip mall promoting the pool business that traded out a pool for ads last summer.  I bet dude didn’t know his ads would be in the tiniest font available, colored white, and smashed into a story.  The vlog has 100,000 views thanks to the clickBates title and commenters want to know why they are holding Layla at 5 years old and of course, everyone wants to share their own blood and guts pregnancy tale.  The Stewarts are masters at drumming up engagement.


 
 
2.       Katie Clark is stuck in Jersey for another week while Travis’ dad recovers from heart surgery.  While the Clarks tend to Pop, Katie is the built in babysitter, but she does find time to edit together a reel of Hailey at Build A Bear for her birthday, and to celebrate baby Harvey turning 5 months old.  Can’t believe that kid is not even half a year old yet. Hailey did not get PTO while in New Jersey, and has to film another reel praising her dad.  This one shows Hailey with her baby doll that has a boo-boo.  Travis comes to the rescue with a band aid and that obviously makes him a King among men.  Late in the week, Pop Clark gets released from the hospital and they bus all the kids from their cult school to his house to cheer for him and throw roses at his feet as he makes his way inside the mansion their parents are paying for.  Katie is happy to have him bare his chest to show off his scar.  The second Pop was tucked in on the couch, the Clarks hit the road for Tennessee.  Back at home, Katie pretends to workout in order to sell a new protein shake and shows a lost gift to Hailey from GiGi that is packed full of more useless crap.  Katie heads to Target to shop for Travis’ birthday and Kelly Jo is the first to wish him a Happy Birthday.  She says he is one of her “favorite persons” because he is patient, and organized and serves his church… all things Kelly apparently isn’t.  Their weekly vlog shows his family celebrating his birthday, and the celebration at home.  They film the birthday song being performed THREE times.  On the drive back to Tennessee, Travis calls Katie clumsy and says she throws things at him to irritate him all of the time.  The chemistry is just non-existent and they seem more like siblings on a road trip.  Anyway, the big news is that Katie found a used workout mirror on marketplace and this is the thing that is going to motivate her to workout bc hitting the Jesus gym with the sisters ain’t happening for her.  Travis does thank Katie for watching all of the kids while his dad was in the hospital, and they head out for hibachi with Whitney, Zach, Josie, Kelton, Trace, Lydia, Evan and Carlin.  Katie says it’s all of the siblings that live near them… but I can think of a few that were left out.  For good measure, we hear the birthday song one more time.  By the way…. Travis turned 24.  That’s right…24.


 
 
3.       Josie Balka’s Bible study is all about striving for perfection, and something about that seems so sad.  After last week’s discussion here about the copious amounts of free time Josie seems to have… this week, she is back to being a “busy mom of 3”.  We see Willow at home school, a grocery delivery and the girls completing a craft while Josie is back in her mirror.  Her hair is suddenly long and straight and obviously she has extensions in.  The girls go to swim lessons in sweat suits this week, yall.  No bathing suits in sight and that is amazing.  We do still have to talk to the phone while sitting in a parked car, though.  Willow explains what she is learning in the lessons and Hazel just repeats over and over again “when are we leaving”…. “Can we go now”.  Kelton shows up to read his kids a Bible story that Josie films through her gauzy, shadowy filters.  Josie says she is going to be doing a q and a and we all know that means lots of links are on the way.  The biggest news we find out is that she had her colors done and is a “soft autumn” so she has started wearing lots of forest green, and that they definitely want a 4th baby bc Miles has been an absolute dream of a baby who has caused them no difficulty whatsoever.  She also tells us that Willow recently started a home school co-op and that she is the closest with the sisters who have lives just like hers.  You don’t say….  The entire time Josie is talking to her phone, she is wearing a pool noodle in her hair and it is absolutely torn all to hell.  The ends are frayed and the stuffing is coming out… but please, still purchase one from her bc they are the absolute best.  Kelton takes Josie out for a date night to a small business awards program and dinner afterwards that she films.  Big surprise that they are at Ruth’s Chris steakhouse.  These people must moo in their sleep.  She wraps up the week with the family at the playground and then cosplaying Ballerina Farm in her frilly apron making sourdough cinnamon sticks.



 
4.  Alyssa Webster committed a cardinal sin this past week when she attended church with 3 of her 4 daughters in unmatched outfits.  Baby PaPaw Rhett was in his suspenders and pleated plants and one has to wonder if the rules of matching were relaxed bc Lurch was away on vacation with Allie.  We see Allie at the airport with her dad where she scores a whole entire drink to herself and her smile reaches her eyes for the first time in months.  John drops Allie off and takes the first thing smoking back out again.  His solo trips seem to be becoming a routine thing. Alyssa sends Allie to fetch her twice daily coffee drink just to remind her of her place in life and then mommy dearest shows off her clean house, their beige dinner and how she is killing her easy plants.  Funny that those plants only live as long as her discount code is active.  The Webster kids take a trip to the local dentist where they line up for pictures so their mom can filter their faces off in a new location.  Rhett stars in his very own waiting room photo shoot with mom who is glowing to have some alone time with her heartstrings. Later, we see a gifted package of outfits for the girls that Alyssa rips open alone, and then they head off to that dude’s basement for another karate lesson.  The Mormon Mom dress shop hooks Alyssa up with 2 new floor length feed sacks trimmed in eyelet lace and she agrees to turn her comments back on so they can spam her ad with bots pretending to tell her which dress is prettier.  This is all AI generated content, but a few real comments seep in, including one from Tikky the super fan, who is still supplying Alyssa with free shoes, and a few followers who say her dresses all look the same and that she should wear something different if she’s going on a date bc she seems dressed for a funeral.  Michael and Katie comment, but she only responds to Tikky.




5.     Zach Bates is becoming a full time, full on influencer.  He shows us his homemade bread baking and has an ad for a toaster oven.  Whitney shares that the forgotten baby Lily has broken her arm, making her the second Bates under 2 with a broken bone recently.  The baby is in an arm length cast bc she fell from a stool.  Come to find out, you cannot supervise kids while also spending all day on IG... who knew.  Anyway, no need to worry bc the baby has both a sistermom and a brothermom that will be keeping a closer eye on her, plus to quote her parents... She is very “tough”.  Zach is kind enough to promote Michael’s cooking vlog.  Both of their cooking vlogs have super low views, but at least Michael followed her recipe and kept everything in the bowl.  Whitney strips down to her sports bra again to sell athletic wear for a brand that is not hers and Zach shows off the big breakfast he has time to leisurely cook his brood on a weekday morning.  Aunt Ellie stops by to bring the kiddos some light up balloons and Zach promotes his new vlog that features his youngest sister Callie.  Callie seems at ease behind the camera, and is confident as she shares her boiled, bland, beige recipe.  Zach finds a way to mess it up by adding things not in Callie’s recipe.  He doesn’t demonstrate what he added or how and just squeezes it into the end of the vlog.  God bless the young fundie bride trying to follow this man’s lead bc they will surely be sent to the prayer closet to repent.  Anyway, Callie says she routinely cooks for the 7 people left at home.  Does that mean Isaiah and Warden have moved out?  Zach says to expect more of his siblings to show up as guests on his cooking show and that feels like a real threat.  They join Carlin and Evan, Trace and Lydia, Josie and Kelton and Katie to celebrate Travis’ birthday at a hibachi joint.  The chef has to toss shrimp in the air with 8 iphones filming his every move.




6.     Lydia Bates is thrifty, y’all! After sparing no expense with baby #1, she is reeling it in with this new kid and takes us along as she goes consignment shopping.  She is slipping into Alyssa territory with her repeated posting of gym, gym mirror, making bed, cooking breakfast.  She does mix it up a tiny bit by promoting a new kiddie vitamin gummy that we never actually see Ryker eat. Lydia gives us a tour of the nursery that takes approximately 4 seconds and she shows us how she is stripping every last piece of color away from every piece of furniture and decoration. Josie invites Lydia over to eat all of the cinnamon rolls and sticks she is depression baking and we see the boys play together.  The weekly vlog is really just a moronic ad for a huge power pack.  They haul a blender to the state park, put it in the grass, plug it in to the battery bank, and blend a smoothie right there in the great outdoors.  Just what everyone wants to do! Once they haul their entire kitchen back from the park, they sit down to talk baby names.  Lydia admits she doesn’t like her son’s name and says Ryker has never looked like a Ryker to her. She likes “cottage core” girls names like Lilah, Sky and Elle.  Trace has never heard of half of the names Lydia mentions, and only likes names of prisons, gun manufacturers and right wing bigots.  He didn’t know his sister had a baby named Weston, and neither one of them realize that Layla’s middle name is Rae... which is what they say they will be using for a middle name.  Listening to these 2 talk to each other is better than any insomnia medication on the market.




7.     Michael Keilen puts down her needle and thread to head to Florida and the Paine compound.  Erin needed help whipping beef fat into lotion and the kids needed to see an adult that wasn’t seething with rage just beneath the surface.  We see her reading to the Paine children... Bible stories only, of course, and playing games.  There is no new vlog this week, but Michael does share plenty of pictures back at the dam park they love so much. Brandon gets up close and personal with some flowering weeds and Michael shows us the water rushing by.  Riveting.




8.     Lawson Bates continues to damage his child’s hearing with his constant caterwauling.  This week he ruined a George Strait classic.  Tiffy took a page from her sisters-in-law and filmed while in church. She and Lawson are on the road again and have JebJud and Callie with them for a visit with Nate and Esther. Tiffy films a reel where baby Will says “Momma” first... truly he chose the lesser of 2 evils.  Lawson continues to play influencer showing off mixtiles in his tight jeans.  Tiffy posts a reel showing Lawson beating the stuffing out of a padded foot rest. She thinks this is cute, but it’s actually sort of concerning. Why would a grown, 32 year old man ever need to punch a piece of furniture?  In other news, the Red Flag Guy’s TikTok featuring Lawson has over 2 million views and counting, making it one of his most viewed videos. Lawson has plenty of material to keep his red flag flying for months.




9.     Chad Paine has been busy at his full time job of destroying other people’s houses.  Erin is proud to show off his latest handiwork, which looks exactly like his previous handiwork.  It’s just more book shelves and long wooden tables.  Dude can build them in his sleep, and is a pro at tearing them down when it’s time to pack the Uhaul.  After not even acknowledging Erin in last week’s Chad Praise Post, this week he runs through the frame with a definite grimace on his face.  Later in the week, Erin is back to heap some more accolades on King Chad.  This time we see him building on to an old wooden swing set that a church member donated to them.  I swear his mistress is a 2x4.  Their suburbanite neighbors are probably beside themselves talking about the new cult-de-sac.




10.    Bits & Bytes...Ellie Bates is the most popular model at BSB these days garnering many comments and compliments....Whitney and Carlin are modeling for the boutique again in $80 sundresses and $70 cotton short sets....The boutique celebrates International Women’s Day by offering a faded pickleball t-shirt for just $45....The Double Date Podcast remains dormant.  Followers have left comments saying it disappeared from their subscriber list and that there is another podcast with the same name.  Any bets on a rebrand... or will it make its way to the graveyard beside the sad hats and the ABC’s of Jesus?




Have a great week friends. Spring is so much closer and I am so excited I wet my plants!

1j8csik,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1j8csik/do_not_eat_at_the_second_kings/,DO NOT EAT AT THE SECOND KINGS.,"My name is Blake, and if you’re reading this, I’m probably dead.

I’ve spent my entire life chasing perfection in the kitchen. I was raised in a small town, but food—real food—was always my escape. I dedicated every waking moment to mastering the craft, spending four years in high school culinary programs before clawing my way into the CIA—the Culinary Institute of America. It wasn’t easy. It took letters of recommendation from multiple chefs, years of relentless practice, and even winning an Iron Chef competition with my high school team to secure a scholarship.

That’s where I met Dakota.

From day one, we were inseparable. He wasn’t just a classmate—he was my brother in arms, my rival, my confidant. We endured everything together: the brutal knife drills, the endless mise en place, the exhaustion that gnawed at our bones as we pushed ourselves beyond what was healthy. We’d spend entire nights practicing cuts, burning through paychecks on vegetables just to perfect our julienne, brunoise, and chiffonade techniques. When we weren’t chopping, we were cooking, testing mother sauces on every dish imaginable, handing our creations to the local homeless because there was no way we could eat it all.

By the time we graduated, we had one goal: to be more than just chefs. We wanted to be legends.

Our plan was simple—travel the world, absorbing every culinary secret we could. We worked for masters in Africa, learning precision from the chefs at La Colombe and FYN. In the Middle East and India, we unlocked the mysteries of spices in kitchens like OD Urla and Benares. We mastered pasta in Italy, learned sushi in Japan, and dissected the soul of true French cuisine in Michelin-starred havens across Europe. We butchered creatures in Australia that looked ready to kill us first, learned the power of cocoa and coffee in South America, and perfected soups in the frozen depths of Russia.

By the time we returned to the States, we weren’t just cooks. We were weapons.

That’s when we heard about The Second Kings.

If you haven’t heard of it, that’s intentional. It’s the most exclusive restaurant in the world. No reservations. No public records. Only the highest of the high—politicians, celebrities, the untouchable elite. The kind of people who move the world while the rest of us just live in it. Dinner costs nearly $6,000 per person. The only people who ever seem to work there are those who never talk about it again.

We had to get in.

The interview was… strange. They were replacing two chefs who had left together—odd, but not unheard of. The moment we stepped into the kitchen, I could feel something was off. There were rules, beyond the usual fine-dining hierarchy. No talking to the guests beyond describing the dish. No discussing your personal life. No questioning the ingredients. The menu changed every seven days, with each chef responsible for a new, innovative dish.

Then came the meat.

It was always something exotic. Strange cuts from animals we couldn’t identify. The textures were… wrong. But the clientele demanded the rarest, the most forbidden flavors. We were told not to ask where the shipments came from—just to cook.

I should have left then.

One night, the owner walked by, looking ragged. I stopped him, concerned.

“Everything okay, Chef?”

He hesitated, then leaned in. “Lost a shipment in transit,” he muttered. “Had to get something else… primate, shipped from the U.S.”

I froze. Primate? From the U.S.? That didn’t make sense. There aren’t wild primates in the States.

Then the delivery arrived.

The moment I unwrapped the meat, my stomach turned. The flesh was pale, the muscle structure… wrong. My hands shook as I picked up my knife. I started breaking it down, telling myself it was just another animal—just another rare delicacy. But when I reached the elbow, I felt nothing. No joint. No cartilage. No resistance. The blade slid through like butter.

A sickening realization crawled up my spine. Either I had just made the cleanest cut of my life—or there was no bone to hit.

I took a step back. My breath came in short, ragged bursts. The weight of every sleepless night, every strange cut of meat, every rule about secrecy crashed down on me at once.

I looked around the kitchen, at the others working quietly, mechanically, as if none of this was wrong.

And then I looked at Dakota.

His hands were trembling too. His knife hovered over the flesh, and for the first time since I had met him, he looked… afraid.

“Dakota,” I whispered. “This isn’t—”

The owner was suddenly beside me, his breath hot against my ear.

“Is there a problem, Chef?”

I turned, ready to demand answers—when the doors opened, and the guests arrived.

It was Political Night.

I watched them take their seats, the most powerful men and women in the country, chatting, smiling, drinking their overpriced wine.

They had no interest in us.

Just in the food.

The food we had been making for months.

My stomach churned as I thought back to the dishes I had prepared—cervelle de veau, a delicate brain dish. A liver entrée the month before. The exotic meats that always seemed to appear exactly on schedule.

I knew. I fucking knew.

I turned to the owner, my voice a whisper. “What the hell are we cooking?”

He didn’t even flinch. He just took me by the arm, led me to his office, and slammed the door shut.

“This,” he said, “is why we’re so expensive. This is why we move so often.”

He told me everything.

The shipments weren’t just lost. They had been intercepted by the FBI. The “meat” came from newborns—stolen from hospitals. Parents were told they were stillborn. Told they hadn’t survived the night.

And now, I had fed them to the world’s elite.

I staggered back. My vision swam. My stomach twisted as bile rose in my throat. I turned and vomited, spilling my insides onto the cold tile.

I needed to leave. I needed to find Dakota and run.

Then I noticed something.

The belongings of the last two chefs—the ones we had replaced? Still in their lockers. They never left.

A sharp pain exploded at the back of my skull. My world went black.


---

I woke up in the freezer.

My head throbbed. My hands were numb. My breath came out in ragged gasps, forming clouds in the freezing air.

They thought they had killed me.

They didn’t check my phone.

My battery is at 5% as I type this. I can hear footsteps approaching.

If you’re reading this, don’t eat at The Second Kings.

It’s 6:24.

Goodbye.

1. Introduction to Voice Assistants in Smart Homes

Voice assistants are AI-powered software platforms that respond to voice commands to perform tasks, answer questions, and control connected devices. In the context of smart homes, they act as the central hub, enabling users to manage everything from lighting and thermostats to security systems and entertainment devices with simple voice commands.

The rise of voice assistants has transformed the way we interact with technology, making it more intuitive and accessible. But not all voice assistants are created equal. Each platform has its own ecosystem, strengths, and limitations, which can significantly impact your smart home experience.

---

2. The Top Voice Assistants for Smart Homes

Let’s take a closer look at the four leading voice assistants in the market:

2.1 Amazon Alexa

Amazon’s Alexa is one of the most popular voice assistants, thanks to its extensive compatibility with third-party devices and robust skill ecosystem. Alexa is powered by Amazon’s cloud-based AI and is available on a wide range of devices, including the Amazon Echo smart speakers, Fire TV, and even third-party hardware.

Key Features:

- Skills: Alexa’s skills are like apps that extend its functionality. There are over 100,000 skills available, ranging from controlling smart home devices to playing games and ordering food.
- Routines: Alexa allows users to create routines that automate multiple actions with a single command. For example, saying “Good morning” could turn on the lights, play the news, and start your coffee maker.
- Device Compatibility: Alexa supports a vast array of smart home devices, including lights, thermostats, cameras, and more, making it one of the most versatile options.

Pros:

- Extensive third-party device support.
- Large skill ecosystem.
- Affordable hardware options.

Cons:

- Privacy concerns due to Amazon’s data collection practices.
- Less intuitive for complex queries compared to Google Assistant.

---

2.2 Google Assistant

Google Assistant is known for its superior natural language processing and integration with Google’s ecosystem of services, including Google Search, Maps, and Calendar. It’s available on Google Nest devices, Android smartphones, and third-party hardware.

Key Features:

- Contextual Understanding: Google Assistant excels at understanding context and follow-up questions, making conversations feel more natural.
- Integration with Google Services: Seamless integration with Gmail, Google Calendar, and other Google services enhances productivity.
- Multi-Room Audio: Google Assistant supports multi-room audio, allowing you to play music across multiple speakers in different rooms.

Pros:

- Superior AI and natural language processing.
- Deep integration with Google services.
- Excellent for answering complex queries.

Cons:

- Fewer third-party skills compared to Alexa.
- Limited support for non-Google devices.

---

2.3 Apple Siri

Siri, Apple’s voice assistant, is deeply integrated into the Apple ecosystem, making it the go-to choice for users of iPhones, iPads, Macs, and HomePods. While Siri’s smart home capabilities are more limited compared to Alexa and Google Assistant, it excels in privacy and ease of use for Apple users.

Key Features:

- HomeKit Integration: Siri works seamlessly with Apple’s HomeKit platform, allowing users to control compatible smart home devices.
- Privacy Focus: Apple is known for its strong commitment to user privacy, with data processing done on-device whenever possible.
- Ease of Use: Siri’s integration with iOS and macOS makes it incredibly easy to use for Apple device owners.

Pros:

- Strong privacy protections.
- Seamless integration with Apple devices.
- Simple and intuitive interface.

Cons:

- Limited compatibility with non-Apple devices.
- Fewer features compared to Alexa and Google Assistant.

---

2.4 Samsung Bixby

Bixby is Samsung’s voice assistant, primarily found on Samsung smartphones, smart TVs, and appliances. While it’s not as widely adopted as the other three, it offers unique features for Samsung device users.

Key Features:

- Device Control: Bixby is designed to control Samsung devices, including smartphones, TVs, and home appliances, with a high degree of precision.
- Bixby Routines: Similar to Alexa’s routines, Bixby Routines automate tasks based on time, location, or user behavior.
- Integration with Samsung Ecosystem: Bixby works best within the Samsung ecosystem, offering tight integration with Samsung apps and services.

Pros:

- Excellent control over Samsung devices.
- Unique features like Bixby Vision.
- Strong integration with Samsung’s ecosystem.

3. Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a Voice Assistant

When deciding which voice assistant is best for your smart home, consider the following factors:

3.1 Compatibility

The first thing to consider is whether the voice assistant is compatible with your existing smart home devices. Alexa and Google Assistant are the most versatile, supporting a wide range of third-party devices. Siri and Bixby, on the other hand, are more limited in their compatibility.

3.2 Ease of Use

Ease of use is crucial, especially if you’re new to smart home technology. Google Assistant and Siri are known for their intuitive interfaces, while Alexa’s extensive skill ecosystem may require a bit more setup.

3.3 Privacy

Privacy is a growing concern for many users. Apple’s Siri is the clear winner in this category, with its strong commitment to on-device processing and data encryption. Google Assistant and Alexa, while convenient, have faced criticism for their data collection practices.

3.4 Ecosystem Integration

If you’re heavily invested in a particular ecosystem (e.g., Apple, Google, or Samsung), it makes sense to choose a voice assistant that integrates seamlessly with your devices and services.

3.5 Customization and Automation

Alexa and Google Assistant offer robust customization and automation options, such as routines and multi-room audio. Siri and Bixby are more limited in this regard but still offer basic automation features.

---

4. Use Cases: Which Voice Assistant is Best for You?

4.1 For Tech Enthusiasts

If you love experimenting with new gadgets and want the most versatile voice assistant, Amazon Alexa is the way to go. Its extensive skill ecosystem and compatibility with a wide range of devices make it a playground for tech enthusiasts.

4.2 For Google Users

If you’re already using Google services like Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Maps, Google Assistant will integrate seamlessly into your life. Its superior AI and contextual understanding make it ideal for complex queries and productivity tasks.

4.3 For Apple Users

If you’re an iPhone, iPad, or Mac user, Siri is the natural choice. Its integration with Apple’s HomeKit platform and strong privacy protections make it a reliable option for Apple enthusiasts.

4.4 For Samsung Users

If you own a Samsung smartphone, TV, or smart appliances, Bixby offers the best integration and control over your devices. While it may not be as versatile as Alexa or Google Assistant, it excels within the Samsung ecosystem.

---

5. Privacy and Security Considerations

Privacy is a critical factor when choosing a voice assistant. Here’s how the top contenders stack up:

- Apple Siri: Apple is known for its strong privacy protections, with data processing done on-device whenever possible. Siri also anonymizes user data and does not associate it with your Apple ID.
- Google Assistant: Google collects data to improve its services, but it offers robust privacy controls, including the ability to delete your voice recordings.
- Amazon Alexa: Alexa stores voice recordings by default, but you can opt out of this feature. Amazon also offers a privacy dashboard to manage your data.
- Samsung Bixby: Bixby’s privacy practices are similar to Alexa’s, with data stored in the cloud by default. However, Samsung offers privacy controls to limit data collection.

---

6. The Future of Voice Assistants in Smart Homes

The future of voice assistants is bright, with advancements in AI, natural language processing, and device integration. We can expect to see:

- Improved AI: Voice assistants will become even more intelligent, with better contextual understanding and personalized responses.
- Enhanced Privacy: As privacy concerns grow, voice assistants will likely adopt more on-device processing and encryption.
- Greater Integration: Voice assistants will continue to expand their compatibility with third-party devices and services, making them even more versatile.

---

7. Conclusion: Which Voice Assistant is the Best for Smart Homes?

The best voice assistant for your smart home ultimately depends on your specific needs and preferences. Here’s a quick summary to help you decide:

- Amazon Alexa: Best for versatility and third-party device support.
- Google Assistant: Best for AI and integration with Google services.
- Apple Siri: Best for Apple users and privacy-conscious individuals.
- Samsung Bixby: Best for Samsung device users.

No matter which voice assistant you choose, you’ll be taking a significant step toward creating a more connected and convenient smart home. Evaluate your priorities, consider the factors discussed in this guide, and make an informed decision that aligns with your lifestyle.

Help me best enjoy your beautiful city!","3 days in Manhattan, first week of september after a road trip on the east coast (also visiting Niagara Falls, DC and Philadelphia)

I’m from Italy so not really interested in pasta or italian cuisine (sorry but I have the real thing at home).

Same for fish food. There is a wide selection of excellent seafood dishes in my country, so maybe I just want a good lobster roll if I can fit a good spot in my itinerary.

Regarding NY-style pizza, already had Joe’s, I have a couple of slices in my wishlist.


Looking for famous/iconic spots and small family-owned good restaurants

Based on 8th between 28th and 29th (2 blocks away MSG)


**Please note:** I come from a place where 99% of your chains or favorite places don't exist. I'm trying to make an itinerary as diverse and comprehensive as possible to get the real New York dining experience based on my tastes and needs.

With that in mind, I don't feel like I'm going wrong in case I want to try some of the more touristy places or some of the fast-food chains that don't exist in my country, because for us Europeans it's not that easy and cheap to travel to the U.S., so it might be one of my few opportunities to try them even if only out of curiosity.


**Please note pt 2:** Due to the nature of my trip I have little time to visit New York City, limited to Manhattan, so I have to make choices.

For example, I would like to go to Gotham Burger but my only chance would be on day 2, right after Katz's. Besides the fact that I don't know if I would be able to eat the sandwich and the burger one after the other, I’m aware that there will be lines at both places and I will have to decide how to manage my time if I want to be able to do everything I set out.




**Please feel free to advise me on the best choice where I am undecided, or point me to some alternatives**



# DAY 0

In this day I'll do some things with friends before cointinuing by my own, so some ""classic"" stuff will be done in this day (like Empire, Top of the rock, grand central..). I don’t have food ideas for this day. We will just go with the flow.

# DAY 1 (central park, midtown)

**gray’s papaya** , **william greenberg dessert** x  **levain bakery** , **Janie life-changing baked goods**

AMNH and Central Park walk.

**7th Burger 86th** 

In the afternoon st patrick, rockfeller center.

**Katsu-Hama** (berkshire porklion katsu curry, also, even if I know this applies for many NYC restaurants, I’ve been told that if you are alone it is easier to find a seat and skip the line)

Walking from there to Theater District and Time Square

**Patisserie Fouet**

In the evening looking for recs near MSG/Penn Station. I’ll do koreatown the next day, so i’m looking for other walk in solo restaurants in the nearby.  **Shukette** could be an option (frena, shrimps kebab, grilled lamb skewer, shawarma fries). Other recs in the same range?



# DAY 2 (lower manhattan and chinatown)

**S&P lunch**

Flatiron

**Breads Bakery** (babka)

Union square (stop at forbidden planet and strand bookstore)

**Brooklyn Bagel and Coffee Company**

Heading south to Financial District

**Luke’s Lobster** or **Seamore’s** (best lobster roll in FiDi/Battery Park? Looking for other recs. In addition, I have heard only good opinions about the roll at **The Original Soup Kitchen** .  Although I am not a soup fan, might it be worthwhile to include this stop in my itinerary only for the roll?)


Charging bull and 9/11 memorial

In the afternoon going to Chinatown (food tour starting from Mott St.)

**Mei Lai Wah** (pinapple roast pork bun) 

**Shu Jiao Fu Zhou** (boiled dumplings)
 
**King dumpling** (pan fried dumplings)

 Little Italy (I know it’s only Mulberry St and the “real” Little Italy on Arthur Avenue, but ehy I’m Italian, I need to go there only to take a pic at the welcome sign)

**Economy Candy**

**Kat’s**

**Russ & Daughters** (want to try lox bagel and babka french toast with halvah ice cream, but suggestions are welcome)

Summit for sunset

For dinner **Jongro**  or **Nubiani** or **Turntable Chicken Jazz** (What do you recommend? I’m still undecided between the three places. Also undecided between “classic” KBBQ or Turntable experience which seems different and more fun. Charcoal BBQ at **New Wonjo** is better? Where is easier to get a reservation or walk in for solo dining?



# DAY 3 (hudson yard and west village)

**Liberty bagel**

**Culture Espresso**

Edge

**Daily Provisions** (something to grab on the fly, due to limited time. Wanna try patty melt ant cruller, but i’m open to alternatives in the nearby)

High line walk 

Chelsea Market (just walk through and eat something that inspires me. Probably **Los Mariscos** or **Los tacos n1** )

Walking around West Village until **l’industrie** and **mama’s too**

1j8cmwo,https://i.redd.it/r1rr21na4yne1.jpeg,It’s working!,"Posted to you lovely community just 35 days ago now as I was doubting my progress and looking for non biased opinions. I just couldn’t see the change my husband said he was seeing. I’d lost 8 pounds in 10 weeks and it felt slowww. 

Another month has passed and it’s still slow. I’ve lost another 4 pounds. But it does feel like it’s starting to come together. I’m feeling strong, and I can see that my body is changing. Still got those love handles though - heh. 

I’m told losing weight slowly like this, is the most sustainable way - great! But oh how I wish I was “normal” and could drop more than a pound a week considering just how hard I’m working! Any tips welcome on how other PCOS gals have managed to lose weight a little more speedily, would love to hear it??

Here’s what I’m doing…

- Inositol + magnesium daily
- 2L water (could be more consistent here)
- Low carb, high protein diet
- Tracking calories 1,500 per day 
- 4x weekly weight sessions w/20 min low intensity cardio (Swim or treadmill)
- Daily step count 10k non training days and 6k training days (could up this to 10k on training days?)

This is alongside other lifestyle changes I made many years ago now that had already reduced my symptoms dramatically to almost non existent. (just didn’t necessarily help me with my weight loss personally). 

- Mostly organic all whole food diet
- Non endocrine disrupting skincare (Yuka approved)
- Reduce other toxins in the home like swapping out to stainless steel pans, and glass Tupperware. 
- Usual blood sugar stuff - No naked carbs, No coffee on empty stomach, no snacking, creating an eating window etc. 
- Prioritising self care - knowing when to say no to plans, taking time for myself to rest and get good quality sleep. 

Also, thank you so much for the kind words of encouragement on my last post during a really hard time.

A desk with just a computer, mouse, and keyboard. Maybe a pencil cup. A bookshelf with books and neatly placed curios, but only, like, 5 of them. A coffee table with one book on it. A a credenza with a bowl and vase. I'm losing my mind. 

I don't know if this is related to ADHD, I'm assuming it is, but I feel like I am surrounded by so much stuff when I look at those photos. And I'm not even someone who buys a lot or hoards, I love to throw things away. But, like, every shelf I have is full of little things. My walls are covered in things. My desk is covered in craft tools. Theres a stuffed animal perched on top of my actual TV. I have so many unnecessary lamps. 

When I think of my friends who also have ADHD, their living spaces are similar. All surfaces covered with little things. Not necessarily messy, in fact some of them are quite clean, their knickknacks and doodads are expertly placed. 

I look at these clean and aesthetic photos and it seems so nice; I feel suffocated by my things sometimes. My space can get messy very quickly because there's so many possible things for me to move around at any given time. But, I've tried to purge my space of unnecessary items many times now. I'm at the point where the things I have are things that have made it through 5,6,7 purges and I no longer have much I want to get rid of. But it still feels like so much stuff compared to other peoples houses. 

I don't understand how people don't have the drive to acquire and collect things and fill their space with items they love. To make it so that everywhere you look there's something interesting and thought provoking. Do any of you also feel this way? Like you don't understand these pictures? But, also, like you both want to emulate them and also hate the idea of it at the same time? It's like I want a calm space but I cringe at the thought of not having my little things.

Hey MaximizeMe fam! Ever looked at your week, wondering where all the time goes? Yeah, same here. 😅 I used to swear by time blocking—every minute planned, every hour accounted for. But, you know what? I was still feeling like I was in a hamster wheel.

One day, as I was drowning in yet another color-coded calendar, a friend casually said, “Maybe it’s not about the time but the *energy*.” 🤯 Cue lightbulb moment! I realized I was slogging through tasks when I was drained, like typing emails at 3 p.m. with the efficiency of a sleepy snail.

Here’s what changed:

- **Identify Your Energy Peaks**: Are you a morning bird, a night owl, or someone who peaks at random times like me? Turns out, my brain is most alive post-breakfast and slows down around mid-afternoon. Who knew?

- **Match Tasks to Energy Levels**: I started doing heavy-lifting tasks like brainstorming and decision-making in my energy-packed mornings. The result? My “aha” moments tripled! Afternoon slumps became perfect for easier stuff like organizing files or refilling that snack drawer. 🍫

- **Experiment and Adjust**: It’s all about trial and error. I tried different things, like shifting meetings to when I felt more social (aka had enough coffee). Some stuff flopped, like trying to write reports in the evening. Nope, just more typos.

- **Protect Your Peaks**: It’s tempting to throw in random tasks when you’re in the zone. Resist! Make those peak moments sacred for work that really moves the needle.

But hey, it's not all sunshine and perfectly timed coffee breaks! Sometimes life throws curveballs, and that’s okay. Embrace the chaos and keep tweaking—you’ll find your rhythm.

When it comes to Hydro Flask coffee, these attributes translate into several key benefits:

*   **Superior Temperature Retention:** Hydro Flask's TempShield™ double-wall vacuum insulation is the core of their performance.This technology keeps hot coffee hot (up to 12 hours,as advertised) and cold brew refreshingly cold (up to 24 hours,similarly advertised),preventing temperature transfer to the outside of the flask. Say goodbye to lukewarm disappointments and hello to consistent coffee enjoyment throughout the day.

*   **Durability and Longevity:** Constructed from pro-grade stainless steel, Hydro Flask coffee containers are built to withstand the rigors of daily life.

## Hydro Flask Coffee lineup: Sizes, Models, and Features

The Hydro Flask coffee collection offers a range of sizes and models to cater to different needs and preferences. Here's a breakdown of some popular options:

*   **Hydro Flask 12 oz Coffee Mug:** The 12 oz Hydro Flask coffee mug is a compact and convenient option for those who prefer a smaller serving of coffee or tea.

## Testing and Comparing Hydro Flask Coffee Mugs: Performance and Real-World Use

To determine the best Hydro Flask for coffee, it's crucial to consider real-world performance and user experience. Here's a breakdown of key factors and considerations based on reviews and personal testing:

*   **Temperature Retention:** The primary function of any insulated coffee container is to maintain temperature. Hydro Flask's TempShield™ insulation generally lives up to its claims, keeping hot coffee hot for several hours and cold brew cold for even longer.However, temperature retention can vary depending on factors such as ambient temperature, the temperature of the coffee when initially poured, and how often the lid is opened. Self-reliant tests have shown that Hydro Flask coffee mugs can maintain coffee temperature above 140°F (60°C) for several hours, which is generally considered the minimum temperature for enjoyable hot coffee.

*   **Leak-Proof Performance:** Leak-proof integrity is essential for coffee containers that are transported frequently.The Flex Sip Lid and Flip lid generally perform well in preventing leaks, provided they are properly sealed. Though, it's critically important to note that no lid is completely leak-proof under all circumstances. Excessive shaking, pressure changes (such as during air travel), or damage to the lid seal can perhaps lead to leaks.

*   **Ease of Cleaning:** Cleaning is an important factor for any reusable coffee container. hydro Flask coffee mugs and tumblers are relatively easy to clean, thanks to their smooth stainless-steel interiors. Though, it's critically important to thoroughly clean the lid, especially the flex Sip Lid, as coffee residue can accumulate in its crevices. A bottle brush and warm soapy water are usually sufficient for cleaning, but some users may prefer to use a dishwasher (check the manufacturer's instructions for dishwasher compatibility).

*   **Durability and Scratch Resistance:** hydro Flask coffee containers are known for their durability,but they are not impervious to scratches and dents. The powder-coated finish can be scratched with abrasive materials or sharp objects. However, minor scratches typically do not affect the performance of the flask.Bottle boots can provide additional protection against dents and scratches.

*   **Comfort and Ergonomics:** the comfort of holding and drinking from a coffee mug or tumbler is also critically important. Hydro Flask coffee mugs with handles provide a secure and comfortable grip, while the Flex Sip Lid offers a smooth and effortless drinking experience. the size and weight of the flask should also be considered, especially for those who plan to carry it around for extended periods. The hydro Flask for hot drinks has to be comfortable and easy to handle.

*   **condensation:** Because of the outstanding vacuum insulation in the Hydro Flask, very minimal to absolutely no condensation is expected.

## Choosing the Right Hydro Flask for Your Needs: A Buyer's Guide

With so many options available, selecting the best Hydro Flask for coffee can seem daunting. Here's a guide to help you narrow down your choices:

1.  **Consider your Coffee Consumption Habits:** How much coffee do you typically drink in a day? If you onyl need a single cup, a 12 oz or 16 oz mug may suffice. If you're a heavy coffee drinker or want to share with others,a 20 oz or larger container may be more appropriate.

2.  **Evaluate Your lifestyle and Activities:** How will you primarily use your Hydro Flask coffee container? If you're a commuter,a leak-proof tumbler with a Flex Sip Lid might potentially be ideal. If you enjoy outdoor activities,a durable bottle with a secure lid and a carry strap might be a better choice.

3.  **Think About Lid Preferences:** Do you prefer a one-handed operation, or do you prioritize maximum leak-proof reliability? The Flex Sip Lid offers convenience and a comfortable drinking experience, while the Flip Lid provides a secure seal.

4.  **Consider Your Budget:** Hydro Flask products are generally priced higher than generic insulated coffee containers. However, their superior quality, durability, and performance make them a worthwhile investment for many coffee lovers. Keep an eye out for Hydro Flask coffee sale events or consider purchasing refurbished or discounted models (ensure they are from authorized retailers).

5.  **Explore Color Options and Personalization:** Hydro Flask offers a wide range of color options to suit your personal style. You can also personalize your Hydro Flask with custom engraving, adding a unique touch.

## Tips for Maximizing Your Hydro Flask Coffee Experience

To get the most out of your Hydro Flask coffee container, follow these tips:

*   **Pre-Heat or Pre-Chill:** Before filling your Hydro Flask with coffee, pre-heat it with hot water or pre-chill it with cold water. This will help maintain the desired temperature for longer.

*   **Fill It Up:** The more full the Hydro Flask is, the longer it will maintain the temperature. Air space allows for faster temperature escape.

*   **Secure the Lid Properly:** Ensure the lid is tightly sealed to prevent leaks and maximize insulation.*   **Clean Regularly:** Clean your Hydro Flask regularly to prevent residue buildup and maintain hygiene.

*   **Avoid Abrasive Cleaners:** Use gentle soaps and cleaning brushes to avoid scratching the stainless steel interior.

*   **Store Properly:** When not in use,store your Hydro Flask with the lid off to allow it to air dry.

As we look towards 2025, several trends and developments are likely to shape the Hydro Flask coffee lineup:

*   **Enhanced Insulation Technology:** Hydro Flask is continuously innovating to improve its insulation technology. We may see new materials or designs that further extend temperature retention.

*   **Expanded Color Options and Customization:** Expect to see even more color options and customization possibilities, allowing customers to create truly unique Hydro Flask coffee containers.

>    - ***MB:*** TECH has been bleeding cash for a while now. We haven’t seen the full-year earnings report yet, but the 9M/24 report showed that TECH had only generated $2.1 million in net cashflow, which was down 75% y/y, which resulted in a $21.6 net decrease in cash. While TECH suffered a net decrease in cash in the previous period, so far, this year, it’s 129% worse. TECH has used the PSE to raise several rounds of funding through the sale of preferred shares, and perhaps juggling debt in this way has finally caught up to the company. They failed to redeem the Series B2-C shares in December 2024, which caused the dividend rate to increase from 6.5864% to 14.1425%. The high debt cost plus the operational challenges in a tough, low-margin industry are pushing TECH into a corner. All of the traded prefs (not owned exclusively by the Liu Family) were down 30% (or close to it) which is the maximum one-day drop permitted by the PSE’s dynamic threshold system.

RCR maintained an occupancy rate of 96% (top tier) and paid out 93% of its distributable income for the year. The stock price improved 20% from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. RCR paid ₱0.4261/share in aggregate dividends across four regular dividends and one special dividend, which provided a yield of 8.7% relative to RCR’s FY24 starting price, and a yield of 6.6% relative to RCR’s IPO price.
>    - ***MB:*** It took the Gokongwei Family some time to pay attention to RCR, but once it did, it really demonstrated the depth and breadth of the potential pipeline of injections between RLC and RCR. I’ll admit that I was underwhelmed by RCR’s Q4 dividend after that amazing post-injection Q3 dividend extravaganza, so I’m very interested to see where the Q1/25 dividend lands. Will RCR keep making small incremental adds to the dividend-per-share, or will things kick into a higher gear for RCR shareholders? Either way, from a business risk perspective, I’d be pleased to enter this year with a higher percentage of mall assets, and I’d be interested to see that percentage holding to continue climbing as soon as possible.

BLOOM has some experience with online gambling, as it was permitted to take online bets during the COVID crisis, but some analysts believe that BLOOM will need to be “very creative and aggressive to attract players” [[link](https://business.inquirer.net/510915/bloomberry-pushing-for-online-gaming-but)] due to PLUS’s established dominance in the sector.
>    - ***MB:*** BLOOM was the belle of the ball, right up until it wasn’t. The stock is down 67% over the past year, and while some are looking at this like a temporary dip, others are concerned about how sticky this growing preference for online betting might be, and worried about the growing competition for in-person gaming from other regional players, like Japan. Personally, I don’t know anybody that has gone to a physical casino in the past year, but nearly all of my friends have placed bets online in some form, whether it be on PLUS games or sports betting apps. I might be a little order than BLOOM’s target demographic, but my friends and I are in the right income bracket to play high-stakes poker and other games in-person. A couple of my friends did this pre-COVID, joining multi-day tournaments and dropping tons of money. But nobody has done this since COVID, and I haven’t heard of anyone even voicing the desire to do so. Online gambling is attractive to BLOOM because it is more addictive than physical gambling, reaches a wider audience, and requires way less in terms of land, headcount, and logistics to set up and maintain. Will this be a successful venture for BLOOM, or yet another example of the “We did not do this because it is easy, but because we thought it would be easy” meme?

1j8c813,https://www.reddit.com/r/humans_on_suboxone/comments/1j8c813/quitting_7oh_using_subs/,Quitting 7-OH using subs,"For background, I've been an on and off again kratom user since 2018.  Mostly on.  Quit again around December 1st, 2024, then relapsed around Feb 1st.  This time on 7-OH tablets.  Oh baby do those things feel fantastic!!!  Sinister little tablets though.  Usually take one large amount once a day, until 4 days ago, started taking twice.  Usually around 50-60 mgs per dose, with occasional Feel Frees/Kanvas tossed in there \[1-2 per day\].  Well, I see where this is going and it needs to stop.  7-OH is more expensive than drugs!  Does it really cost that much to produce these things???  Fuckers!!!

Physical WDs are/were not too bad first 24 hrs.  Its the emotional craving and depression that is the worst for me.  I mean I start having SI pretty quickly.  Anyways, did some homework on using subs short term.  Got on QuickMD yesterday, made an appt this morning.  The conversation was literally 7 mins and I got a script for 16 8-mg strips. It's that easy!!!  Waited 24 hours since last final dose of \~100 mgs 7-OH and popped 1/8 of a strip of subs (1 mg).  Don't feel fantastic, but stomach pain and that feeling of hopelessness disappeared within about an hour.  In fact I almost have a peaceful/content/semi-happy feeling.  And that was just 1 mg sub.  Eating confetti popcorn and drinking coffee, something I would need kratom before to enjoy.  Not seeking a high on subs and keeping low.  Probably take 1 more mg before bed to help with sleep.  Plan to do this 4-5 days and stop subs, but I may stick to them long term.    

I'm always happier with life on ""something"" sadly.  When I've have period of kratom abstinence, I'm not miserable, but the god damn anhedonia is ceaseless.  I've had 3-4 months off kratom before, didn't have any physical withdrawals even CT'ing, but just felt blah constantly.  Everything in life good, but just little to no joy.  Diet, food exercise, you name it.  I will say I wasn't working a thorough program of recovery and it would've likely helped.  AA/NA works but it takes ""rigorous honesty.""  At any rate, after 3-4 months sober here, 2 months there, always having the blahs, I would have a ""fuck it"" moment and right back in the cycle.  I say this in recognizing my brain circuitry is skewed.  I am coming to peace with the idea of possibly being on low dose subs (2-4 mgs/daily) for an extended period if after a few days, if I continue to feel good.  I don't want a sub dependency, but I want my peace of mind back.  Haven't had it in years.  Never comfortable enough to date.  Anti-social.  Always on something, lying about it, and so on.  Oh, I'm also an alcoholic.  Pretty nasty one at that.  When I'm on subs, craving for the sauce goes away, too. 

I'm a habitual relapser who's never throughly worked on myself.  If the subs can afford me that, fuck it!  At least I'm alive and not heading for my 5th rehab and/or 2nd psych ward.  Something about feeding those opiate receptors, artificially or naturally, provides us depressive addicts with relief from so many ills.  

Look forward to you peoples' input!

I have never been able to so I assumed you couldn't.
Also, is there a way to create other shops (library or art gallery as an example). Each time I try those, buy mod items never show the vast quantity of objects I can purchase fory house. If I make it under ""household"" then change the lot to a community it loses most of the objects.

1j8c663,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1j8c663/aita_for_creating_the_creature_and_showing_my_wife/,AITA for creating The Creature and showing my wife?,"I (24M) love doing morbid little experiments, creating homunculi out of odds and ends I found around the house or on the street. Muck, funk, detritus, among other private elements. My wife (33F) loves this stuff. Calls me Mr. Frankenstein. I call her Sexy Lady. She's the first female I ever met who I didn’t need to hide my creations from. She shared my love of the weird and the macabre. I hide my creations around the house. At the tops of the steps, in cabinets, under our bed, etc. When my wife finds my latest creation, she will let out the cutest screams & laughs. Her favorite is her Jar Homunculus I gave her for her birthday. She keeps it by her bedside table, rubbing it for sweet dreams. Please do not ask for schematics or instructions for my processes. My creations are my own and not to be imitated.
She is 7 months pregnant and that may be affecting her (hormones). But last Friday, I fear I did too much. I created The Creature. I found a pigeon dead on our doorstep. Dropped by kitty(4M). No, I don't kill or hurt animals. I am a man of peace and science. My experiments only involve the dead and other non-animate material. (I do not believe in ghosts, souls or the supernatural.)

The carcass was too good to pass up. The color, form, condition. Perfect, So, with it, I created The Creature. Visible elements included the pigeon, garden clay, resin, marbles, wife's hair, coffee dye, orange peel, battery and electrode. Among other non-visible elements, (not relevant in upsetting my wife). While my wife was at work, I spent 6+ hours in my laboratory designing and constructing my finest work. The Creature was something special. I hid him in an open-faced cubby in my wife's closet, knowing she'd be face to face with The Creature when she opened it. I hid my creations here before with no issue.

She was not happy when she found the creature. She called me a CREEP and said The Creature was an abomination. She said she was “sick of my stupid fucking hobby”. She’ said I'm inhumane. That I have no regard for life, I've gone too far. . I explained to her that I didn’t kill the pigeon and but she shot me down. The creature is a little darker than my average creation. Kitty was not kind. A simple pully system of hair allowed his wings flap when activated (she pointed this out during the argument.) But the creature is ultimately in line with all of my other creations.

She sent me to stay at my mom’s house for the weekend. Now I’m back home but my wife is still being cold. I saw she didn’t have the Jar Homunculus on her nightstand and I asked where it was. She said she got rid of it because she just couldn’t look at it. I don’t know what I did wrong. I feel like she’s rejecting this part of me that I thought she loved. This is who I am.Did I go to far? Is she overreacting or is The Creature is really an abomination? I will continue my creations. It is my truest passion. I just need to know if The Creature was a mistake.

1j8c4a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/1j8c4a2/barely_acknowleding_my_gender_identity/,barely acknowleding my gender identity,"so :D ... gender has always been an issue with me. i consider myself to be a woman; she/her, afab, whatever despite identifying as many things in the past (non-binary & demigirl). but to be honest i've been avoiding the concept of gender for a **long time**, even though i used to identify with non-binary labels in the past. mainly because it isn't as direct/a little less as sexuality especially since im autistic. it's easier for me to determine that i like non-men because of the flutters i get in my chest and the blush i feel in my cheeks when a butch offers me something simple like making me a coffee for free or just *looking* at one. sure it took me a while to find out i was a femme4butch lesbian BUT, it wasn't as ambiguous as gender is. 

i'm not sure if it has to do with me being autistic but, the more i think about my gender identity, i dont know *what* the fuck i am and it's a bit intimidating and annoying because its like oh *great*, ANOTHER thing to be confused about. i dont know what it is to ""feel like a girl"" to ""feel like xyz"". and im just like what the fuck lmao i'll just stick with GIRL SHE/HER this is too complicated :') and yet? it still feels performative when i call myself a girl or a woman. i love feminine descriptors but the fact they are are always tied SOLEY with ONE gender (woman) gives me the ick. and it's so weird because i get gender euphoria sometimes when im identified as a woman and yet? there's times that i just get the ick and i feel like crawling out of my skin. im sure this is a reason why i've flip flopped so much between cis and non-binary as mentioned in the beginning of my post!   
  
i cant help how fake i feel when identifying as *just* a woman despite how integral it is to my life no matter how much i can't part with it. because at the end of the day, i am still an **indigenous woman**. spiritually, physically, and personally i am tied to womanhood. i cannot take that away from myself. and things just get more confusing the more i educate myself on queer history and theory. the more i realize that gender is silly, fun, and my belief that gender is a social construct gets reinforced daily especially with its white-supremest and colonial history. 

everything just leads me to think am i just non-binary in denial. and then add on my autistic black and white thinking im like, ""if i know gender is a social construct, why should i continue to uphold and exist within it if it's not real? shouldn't i as an indigenous person break away from colonial gender norms?"" smh. or im so femme lesbian realness that i refuse to be cooped up with the straight cis women. 

i hope this post can offer me some insight and guidance for myself as well as (hopefully) adding onto the conversation of the intersectionality of race, sexuality, neurodivergence, and gender. im really sorry for how lengthy it is; i have a lot of thoughts but not enough space in my brain to process them.

1j8c40u,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1j8c40u/im_an_extra_on_a_tv_show_my_life_is_hell/,I'm an extra on a tv show; my life is Hell,"For the longest time, I thought I had a great life. As a kid, I’d play with my friend at the playground. Neither of us were very popular, so we’d stay towards the back and play quietly while Teddy, the kid everyone wanted to be friends with, played front and centre. At school I’d sit on the floor while the teacher asked us questions and we all eagerly raised our hands. I even got to answer one once. My mom or dad would take me to the cafe or cinema. Looking back, I can’t remember a single film we watched. Funny how memory works. I do remember that I started to feel uncomfortable about being out. I must have been 12-13 years old when I realised. Everywhere I went and spent time: Teddy was there. Or if not him, then a member of his family. I grew up in the city, so it’s not like there was a shortage of places to go. I remember worrying that my parents were stalking him. I wish that had been the case.

I went to college, the same one as Teddy of course. Think it was my dad's idea. We even had all the same classes. I guess I developed a bit of a parasocial relationship with him. It was hard not to, as he wore his emotions on his sleeve and while everyone else in the class sat and listened, Teddy would challenge the professor. It lasted all semester. Then, Teddy donated a kidney or something to the professor's dying kid. The professor had cried when Teddy came to class the day after the surgery, still in his hospital gown with an IV drip. It was...surreal. They hugged and that was that. 

That was Teddy. Everyone loved Teddy. I loved Teddy. Even though I’d lived my life twenty feet from him and he’d never acknowledged my existence. It was a peculiar kind of despair, like a crisis of faith; feeling His presence but never being heard. The next year Teddy had to abandon his studies because of a family matter and it felt like I ceased to exist. I don’t know how much time passed or what I did during that time. Then it happened. 

I was sat in a restaurant, wearing a suit with my tie loose and top button undone. Three other men were with me, dressed similarly. They were all early twenties and I surmise I must have been too. We were laughing uproariously in a manner not befitting the establishment we’d chosen. I don’t remember what the joke was, or if there had even been one. I just remember the feeling of cold dread that flowed down me like all the beers I’d apparently drunk when I saw who had just walked in. Teddy. He looked different but I could tell it was him. Gone was the boyish mop of blond hair, replaced by something short, sharp, and stylish. He was wearing a shirt that was too small and clung lustily to his muscles as he removed his jacket. I was stunned. Then, there was a hand grasping my leg beneath the table and shaking it hard. I turned to find one of my friends, his face smiling but terror in his eyes. 

“Act normal.” His words came out between smiling teeth, scarcely above a whisper. He removed his hand from my leg and took a deep swig of beer. Then he moved his lips as if he was speaking and slapped my chest like he’d just made a joke. He laughed and so did the others at the table. After a moment, I pretended to join in. 

I leaned towards him and whispered. “What’s going on?” Everyone at the table was staring at me in disbelief. 

“Huddle.” One called and they all leaned in so our heads were together. “OK, we’ve not got long.”

“Christ. I was hoping they’d rotate someone after what happened to Paul, not bring in a newbie.” The man shook his head.

“What are you talking about? What is happening? Who’s Paul?” There was too much I didn’t understand and too little I did. 

“I’m Dan.” Said the one who’d shook my leg. He was built like a quarterback. “That’s Tony"" he pointed to the person next to him, a slight guy with his hair in a ponytail. He didn’t seem to be paying attention to us, staring at his phone instead. “And Doug.” The last guy on the table wore a muted expression, lips thinned.

“What’s your name?” Doug asked.

“I'm...” What was my name? Who was I? What was I? My throat went tight and I reached for a bottle and took a long drink. 

“Shit.” Dan said. “Sorry, waking up is always hard.”

“Waking up?”

“To this.” Dan said. “Most people are in a sorta fugue state, unaware of it all.” I opened my mouth to try and get an answer that made sense, but Tony spoke first.

“Guys, that’s Time.” He slipped his phone away and sat back normally. Dan and Doug followed suit. I stayed, leaning on my elbows, trying to make any sort of sense of this. Someone kicked my leg under the table and I sat up. Doug pretended to say something and they all laughed. It felt like the fake-joke was on me, so i wasn’t expected to join in. 

Then I heard the Laughter. It made my skin crawl. It came from off to the right of the table where Teddy sat with his date. Where a wall should have been was a slightly convex mirror. The Laughter came from the mirror. Or, beyond the mirror. It wasn’t a single person, either, but hundreds all laughing in unison. I tried to act natural but every time that Laughter happened I flinched. There was something ethereal in the sound, like all those who made it were long dead. 

I don’t remember how the night ended. I don’t remember paying the bill, saying bye to my ‘friends' or going home. Hell, at this point I don’t even know if I have a home. I expect not. I don’t need one. The next thing I do remember was once more being at the movies. I was sat facing the screen, but there wasn’t a screen; it was the mirror. Or, no, not a mirror. A lens. It was a giant lens. I was on the back row, my hand on some woman’s thigh. Teddy was in the middle seat, his arm around someone; I assume the girl from the restaurant. I quickly removed my hand from the lady's thigh and apologised. 

“I don’t mind.” She said. Her voice was smoky and seductive. She brushed her long dark hair over her shoulder and leaned to kiss me. It was my first kiss. I felt a strange stirring in my pants that I’d never felt before, from a part of my body that, up to that moment, I’d never even considered. She stuck her tongue in my mouth and I wrapped my arms passionately around her. She pushed me away immediately, horrified. 

“Sorry. I’m so sorry.” I mumbled. I stared at the floor, unable to look at her. I hoped I’d disappear again.

“It’s ok.” She put a hand on my shoulder. “But we’re TV-PG. So plain kissing's about all we can do.” She had a soft lilt to her accent I’d not heard before. “Face, shoulders, and waist and you’re safe.” She said, touching her hands against them as she spoke. “Otherwise, keep your hands to yourself when kissing. And don’t run them from one to another. Too risqué. Want to try again, or you need a minute?” Her eyes flickered to my crotch and then back. 

“Uh, no. No I think I’m OK.” I gingerly put my hands on her waist and leaned in to kiss her again. 

I was on a train. My legs nearly gave from under me as I came to, holding an overhead grab handle with the car already in motion. It was densely packed around me, but the other end was almost deserted. Teddy was there talking with his girlfriend and a couple other people. The end of the car past them was the Lens. Looking at it made the back of my eyes burn. Worse, though, was the feeling. An intense feeling of disapproval when I looked. As though the lens was alive. I decided to face the other way. I turned to find the woman from the cinema. I smiled and opened my mouth to speak to her. The look of terror that overtook her face as I did prevented the words from coming out. I gave her a slight nod instead, and she returned it. I closed my eyes and focused on the muted sound of the subway rattling down the line, punctuated occasionally by the Laughter. A feeling of weightlessness scooped me up and pulled the grab handle from me.  My stomach lurched and for one terrible moment I thought the subway had crashed, but I didn’t fall. I didn’t collide with anything or anyone. I opened my eyes but there was nothing. I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face. And I floated there in the void. It could have lasted an hour or years; there was no frame to anchor against.

I sat in a cafe. The same one I’d been to occasionally as a child. It hadn’t changed at all. The tables, chairs, decor, layout, even the barista: the same. A slice of cake and a coffee sat in front of me. I hadn’t eaten in decades. I wanted to reach out and consume it as fast as I could. The only thing that stopped me was the Lens. I could feel it taking me in. I was on its radar and had better not act out. I picked up the cake; it was a slice of lemon loaf. It was sweet and tangy and moist. I took a small bite and chewed it slowly. I nearly cried at how good it tasted. How good it felt to eat anything. Only when I put the cake back down did I realise I wasn’t alone at the table. Dan took a sip of coffee opposite me. 

“Glad you’re back, Josie was worried.” He said. His voice was full of relief, but his face suggested he was engaged in idle conversation. 

“How long was I gone?” 

“Six months.” 

I choked on my coffee. I felt the gaze intensify momentarily. I discreetly wiped my mouth with a napkin and smiled at Dan in a placid way. “Six months?” I asked, trying to act nonchalant. The gaze lessened. 

“You turned your back on it. Try to stay at least half-turned. 3 quarter most.” Dan said. I nodded. I checked my pockets and found a pen then began writing on a fresh napkin. 

“What are you doing?” He asked, trying not to peer at the writing lest he draw Its ire. 

“Making notes.” I scribbled furiously, unsure of how long I had. 

“Don’t waste your time.” Dan said, finishing his coffee. I didn’t have a chance to ask what he meant. 

Sure enough, the napkin had gone next time. Things have only gotten worse. I’ve become increasingly aware of myself, of the hunger and thirst that constantly scratch my throat and gnaw at my stomach like some beast within me. It can be weeks before I’m able to eat anything and it’s never enough to make the feeling go away. But at least I can slake them somewhat. There are other urges that I can never fulfil. I’ve taken a piss once in the last four years; the pain in my bladder can be excruciating. I’ve never taken a shit so my guts just feel twisted and strained most of the time. When I’m gone for a while, those things do disappear, thankfully. But it’s been happening less and less often. And I’ve felt its gaze on me more. Like it knows what I’ve been thinking.

Maybe it does. Maybe it wants this to be over just as much as I do. Or maybe it was goading me. Wanting me to slip up so it could do to me whatever it had done to Paul. The thought made me shudder but I honestly didn’t know how anything could be worse than my current existence. So, I resolved to kill Teddy Corben, the man whose life I lived in orbit of. My first chance came not long after I’d made up my mind. I was in the subway again, but the station this time. Teddy was talking to a friend, the dead Laughter chiming in regularly. They were standing close to the edge, the lens occupying the wall across the track. It would take seconds to charge him and push him onto the track. Then it would be over. The lens could watch but by the time it knew what was happening it would be too late. It had to be too late. The sound of the train grew on the little platform, howling and screeching as it approached. A warning to any creature that could hear to keep away. I pretended to read the newspaper in my hands while I secretly watched for a glimpse of the train, ready to spring into action as soon as I saw it. But it never came. The lens on the wall blinked like a giant eyelid and was replaced with solid wall. A moment later the wall opposite flicked open to reveal the lens and suddenly the train was on the tracks, stopped at the station. The doors cracked open and it sounded like it was laughing at me. Teddy and his friend got on the train and I wasted no time in following. 

It was almost a year before I got another chance. The passage of time only noticeable by weather changes beyond the window or mentions of holidays or birthdays coming up. I rarely saw Dan, Tony, or Doug. They had been grouped together and more and more I was alone when I came to. I saw Josie only once. At a very fancy restaurant, where Teddy was proposing to his long-time girlfriend. Josie was at a nearby table with a man, they both wore wedding rings. I wondered if that meant anything. Probably not. I was alone at the restaurant, of course. In a suit once more, though a more haggard one. My table was replete with bottle of beer and no food. I can’t imagine any dining establishment would actually allow it. I considered just rushing Teddy then, but there were too many people to stop me. No way to get it done before it stopped me. I had to wait. 

Wait. I had nothing but time. Sat at the office, length of cable in my hand and Teddy in the next cubicle. Wait. Teddy singing karaoke while I sat alone at the bar, an empty metal stool next to me. Wait. It no longer mattered that it was always watching. I could feel its gaze shift, ever so slightly, to better watch me in the background. When my chance came, the lens wouldn’t be able to stop me. When my chance came I knew it didn’t want to. I was on the street. It was night-time and the sounds of reverie came from a bar opposite me. Through the window I could see Teddy and some friends. The lens watched from the wall opposite the window, barely able to see me through the haze of rain and glass. But it saw me. I knew it saw me. I turned the collar of my long coat against the rain. The left-hand pocket was heavy. I reached inside, unsure what I’d been given this time. My hand closed around a revolver. 

For the first time in my life I felt the lens' attention on me completely. And it felt...it felt like I was the only thing that mattered in the whole world. Like I was basking in the radiance of love and happiness. Then it was gone. And the cold and dark were that much harsher in its absence. Teddy exited the bar while I tried to recover from the shock. I gripped the revolver tighter and followed him. He had taken that light from me. From all of us in the background. The lens was ahead of him now, ahead of both of us. It backed down the street, enticing us to follow. The warmth fell upon me again, just for a moment. Just enough to remind me how much worse it was without it. I hurried my step. It didn’t take long to catch up to him. I grabbed him by the shoulder and spun him while I drew the gun. Only then did I think about the gun. I didn’t know if it was loaded, if it worked. I didn’t know if it was real or how to use it. I just had to trust. 

There was a look of such complete confusion on Teddy's face that I almost didn’t pull the trigger. The flash from the barrel reminded me of a camera going off.  Then a rumble of thunder that seemed to come from far away. My ears rang and I felt the love and joy and warmth cast upon me again. Teddy's hands were on the gun and I readied for a struggle; it never came. 

“Thank you.” He mouthed. Then he pressed my trigger finger and the gun went off again.

Twilight for Teddy Corben

^(By Alistair Bowen)


The world is still reeling from the surprise death of Teddy Corben on Friday's episode of _You, Me, and the Family_. The sitcom/soap opera had been teasing something big for it’s 40th anniversary episode but fans were not expecting the murder of the Corben family's youngest son. Initially played by twins Dex and Troy Smith when they were just three years old, Teddy had been a fan-favourite character for a decade and a half. Eventually Troy left the show to pursue other interests and the role was left solely to Dex. Except for the wonderful life christmas episode where it was actually Troy playing Ted Corben: the criminal Teddy could have been. 
I had the opportunity to sit down with showrunner Isaac Webster and ask some of the burning questions we all had following the shocking death. Isaac got his start writing on hit British show _Lovesuck_ and was hired to consult on the American adaptation. That show may have failed, but one of his fellow writers was _YM&tF_ mainstay Lenny Bridges. 

__Alistair Bowen__: Let’s start with the obvious. What the Hell is wrong with you? 

__Isaac Webster__: [laughs] Maybe I was dropped on my head as a child? 

__Alistair Bowen__: That checks out! But seriously, why did you decide to kill Teddy? 

__Isaac Webster__: I think, fundamentally, it’s about doing what feels right for the character. And we felt this was the natural conclusion to Teddy's story.

__Alistair Bowen__: So, does that mean there’s no truth to the rumours that Dex was looking to fly the nest and make a go of the silver screen? 

__Isaac Webster__: I can’t speak to Dex’s plans, but this was absolutely a joint decision. We’ve watched Teddy grow up and he’s impacted so many people, both on the show and in real life. We wanted to explore the impact his absence would have. 

__Alistair Bowen__: Speaking of impact! To have Teddy gunned down by a total stranger! Though eagle eyed viewers have noted that the man seems to have been stalking Teddy for weeks. Other, more rabid, fans have even speculated that he was in the background all the way back in Teddy's college days.

__Isaac Webster__: [Groaning] Don’t bring up the college days! I think we’d all rather forget those. I mean the kidney transplant storyline? What were they thinking. We, I should say. 

__Alistair Bowen__: So, it isn't the same person?

__Isaac Webster__: I don’t think I said that! I’m afraid I can’t really go too much into the history of our attacker right now.

__Alistair Bowen__: I take it from that we’ll be seeing more of him.

__Isaac Webster__: I think that’s a guarantee! How much more, well that depends on audience reception. I have this half-crazed notion of following this guy as he goes through prison. 

__Alistair Bowen__: Bit morbid for a sitcom, surely! Then again you did end Lovesuck with a plane crash.

__Isaac Webster__: [laughs] Yeah, and that went down so well! No pun intended [laughs]. But, we were actually toying with a more serious show to fill the end of the prime time slot. More Prison Break than Porridge.*

__Alistair Bowen__: Well, I think I speak for all our readers when I say I can’t wait to see what happens next week! Thanks for taking the time to speak with us today.

__Isaac Webster__: It’s been a pleasure. Hopefully we’ve got at least another 40 years left. 

*_Editor’s note:_ Porridge _was a British comedy from the 1970s set in a prison. Porridge being an old slang term for a jail sentence._

1j8c18g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinQR/comments/1j8c18g/love_is_as_worthless_as_fiat_but_bitcoin_and_qr/,Love is as Worthless as Fiat – But Bitcoin and QR Codes Hold Real Value,"[www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://preview.redd.it/uctn92mp0yne1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b39de83499869dbcf956588cc1c188daf45bf81)

Love. They say it makes the world go ‘round. They also say it’s priceless. But let’s be real—love, much like fiat currency, is often overhyped, easily manipulated, and backed by nothing of real substance. Just like governments print endless money out of thin air, people dish out ""I love you"" like it’s going out of style—devaluing its worth with every casual use.

But you know what isn’t worthless? Bitcoin. And more importantly, Bitcoin transactions powered by QR codes. In a world drowning in false promises and artificially inflated sentiments, Bitcoin remains sound money. And thanks to tools like the [Bitcoin QR Code Maker API](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/), it’s now easier than ever to transact with actual value, free from emotional or economic inflation.

# Love and Fiat: Overprinted, Devalued, and Backed by Nothing

Think about it. Love, like fiat currency, is thrown around recklessly. ""I love this movie!"" ""I love pizza!"" ""I love you!"" But just as central banks print money until it loses all meaning, people overuse and abuse the concept of love, stripping it of its original value.

Here’s how love and fiat currency are disturbingly similar:

1. **Both are Easily Manipulated** – Governments control fiat money, deciding when to inflate or debase its value. Meanwhile, emotions and social pressures manipulate love, making it feel like something people are forced to declare rather than something that holds true meaning.
2. **Both Can Be Counterfeited** – Fake ""I love yous"" are just as rampant as counterfeit bills. Ever heard someone say it just to get what they want? Yeah, it’s a thing.
3. **Neither Hold True Scarcity** – Bitcoin has a fixed supply—21 million coins, no more, no less. Love? Fiat? You can produce an infinite amount, which leads to diminishing returns.

But Bitcoin? Bitcoin is real. It’s scarce. It’s decentralized. And unlike love or fiat, it doesn’t rely on emotions, governments, or empty promises. It’s backed by proof-of-work, mathematics, and the most secure monetary network in human history.

# Real Value Comes From Bitcoin and Seamless Transactions

Unlike flimsy love declarations and unstable fiat money, Bitcoin transactions hold actual value. When you send Bitcoin, you aren’t making a vague promise—you’re transferring provable wealth that can’t be reversed, faked, or manipulated by a central authority.

But here’s the problem: Bitcoin addresses are long, ugly, and prone to human error. One wrong character, and your BTC is lost forever. That’s why smart Bitcoiners use QR codes. And that’s exactly why the [Bitcoin QR Code Maker API](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/) exists—to make Bitcoin transactions as smooth, secure, and foolproof as possible.

# Bitcoin QR Codes: The True Love Language of Crypto

Love might be complicated, but sending Bitcoin shouldn’t be. QR codes simplify transactions, eliminating human error and making crypto payments as easy as scanning and confirming.

# Why Bitcoin QR Codes Are Better Than ""I Love You""

✅ **They Hold Real Value** – No empty promises here. QR codes link directly to verifiable Bitcoin addresses. ✅ **No Room for Confusion** – Unlike romantic signals, QR codes don’t require ""reading between the lines."" Just scan and send. ✅ **They Work Every Time** – No mixed signals, no miscommunication. Bitcoin QR codes deliver every single time. ✅ **Fast, Easy, and Foolproof** – While love takes work, QR code transactions take seconds.

# How the Bitcoin QR Code Maker API Changes the Game

Imagine trying to run an online store or a Bitcoin ATM business. Are you really going to make customers copy-paste wallet addresses like it’s the early 2010s? No chance.

The [Bitcoin QR Code Maker API](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/) allows businesses, developers, and individuals to generate Bitcoin QR codes on demand. No need for manual entry, no errors, and no unnecessary friction—just smooth, instant transactions.

# Features of the Bitcoin QR Code Maker API

1. **Automatic QR Code Generation** – Generate Bitcoin payment QR codes in real-time for seamless transactions.
2. **Customizable Payment Requests** – Set specific amounts and include transaction memos effortlessly.
3. **Seamless Integration** – Works with e-commerce sites, merchant platforms, and Bitcoin ATMs.
4. **Security-Focused** – Eliminates the risks of human error and copy-paste malware attacks.
5. **Lightning Network Ready** – Enables instant, low-fee Bitcoin transactions for businesses and individuals.

# Real-World Use Cases: Bitcoin QR Codes in Action

# 1. Merchants Who Want Real Payments, Not Promises

A coffee shop owner wants to accept Bitcoin, but manual wallet addresses are too cumbersome. By integrating the Bitcoin QR Code Maker API, customers simply scan and pay—no fuss, no mistakes.

# 2. Peer-to-Peer Transactions Without the Drama

Tired of Venmo requests and IOUs? Bitcoin QR codes eliminate the need for excuses. Bob owes Alice 0.01 BTC—he scans the QR code and sends it. No ""I’ll pay you back later."" Just instant, verifiable transactions.

# 3. Bitcoin ATMs That Don’t Waste Time

Bitcoin ATMs use QR codes to send BTC to users quickly. Instead of typing wallet addresses, customers scan their QR codes, ensuring fast and error-free transactions.

# Forget Love, Choose Bitcoin (and QR Codes)

Love might be fleeting, but Bitcoin is forever. It doesn’t fade, it doesn’t lie, and it certainly doesn’t get devalued by overuse. If you want to engage with something real—something that holds actual worth—ditch the sentimental distractions and focus on sound money.

The [Bitcoin QR Code Maker API](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/) ensures that when you send Bitcoin, you do it right. No mistakes, no drama—just real value in every transaction.

Because at the end of the day, it’s not about sweet words or worthless fiat. It’s about precision, security, and transactions that actually mean something.

My office is a satellite office. I work for a multi state firm with thousands of employees. My office in particular consists of about 20 people. It’s small. And nice. But here is what we endure:

Paper plates are locked up so employees can’t use them, but they provide a functional break room. We just have nothing to heat our food up on. 

Coffee cups are for clients only. But they provide coffee, keurigs and everything to make the coffee. Fucking weird. 

We are no longer permitted to celebrate birthdays, plan impromptu happy hours amongst coworkers, or anything social or celebratory unless it’s organized by HR. This is a no fun zone folks. 

We used to be able to clock in on our computers, then they required putting a code into a machine in the wall. And now they require facial recognition only. Tell us you don’t trust us without telling us….

We are only allowed to order supplies from a specific list. The worst, all of our numbered separator sheets for binders don’t come three hole punched. Those are not necessary since we can three hole punch them ourselves. Talk
About wasting time.

It’s crazy actually. And quite annoying. It promotes low morale, negates camaraderie, and seems unnecessary in a small office of people who 100% get along and work hard.  And when I say “we” I mean everyone, attorneys included. ",59,1741647318.0,paralegal,84,0.99,False

Again, thank you for all the supportive messages and I'm especially glad to hear that this saga of mine is benfiting others who are going through similar ordeals.  Most of the action since my last update happened yesterday. Between Wednesday evening and Saturday, I was focused on ghosting my STBXW. Ignoring all avenues of contact.

I'm giving this to you in the order of events rather than the order I learned of the events. I checked the VAR and voice mail on Sunday morning (09/03/25), I had no idea what my wife was doing or what was happening at home before then.

Lets start from the point I drove away.  From the VAR I know that when she realised I was gone she called out my name and opened the front door.  I know she tried to call me about then, so she must have hung up on the AP without much warning.

She called someone else, from the tone it might have been her mother or brother, I don't know. She told them I've left her. Whoever it was must have asked why, because she responded by saying she didn't want to get into it because it was private, but she was worried I wouldn't come back and didn't know where I was. I didn't hear any lies, but I also didn't hear a true account of events.

About half an hour after I had left and while this phone conversation was still ongoing, the AP showed up at our door. She ended the phone conversation. AP said something that was too muffled for me to understand (I don't think she opened the door to him so it was shouted through tripple-glazed glass). She said he can't be here, that he has done enough damage and he has to leave right now. Then she said if he didn't leave she'd called the guards (that's the Irish police, they're called the Garda Siochana, but colloquially people just call them the guards).

I didn't hear from her though the VAR again for the night, which just means she didn't stay in the sitting room.  She could have left the house to visit a friend, because I received another call that night from her using a number I didn't recognise.  I hung up once I knew it was her. She left me a voice mail saying how sorry she was, that she loved me, that she never wanted to see AP again, it was over. She said it was just physical and didn't mean anything. Mostly, she was begging me to call her back or to come home.

Most of the voice mail messages were like that or ""please let me know you're not dead."" In one she was angry, she called me a coward for running away, but after leaving that message she left another one apologising and saying she didn't mean it.

One thing I found odd was that none of her family had tried to contact me.  The VAR cleared that up. She was telling them not to and just to let her know if I contacted them.

You know what?  If I didn't have the VAR, I would have been left assuming she was spouting all sorts of venom about me to her family and mine. Knowing that she didn't calmed me down a bit. Once you've lost trust in someone, these kinds of actions are the only possible way to know if they're telling the truth. I'm not saying that redeems her, but it helps alleviate my guilt for all the snooping and spying. It still feels dirty sometimes.

Sunday morning, 9am, the call I'd been waiting for came through.  It was the AP's wife.  She thanked me for sending her the PI evidence and for making her aware of the affair. I asked what she knew - keep in mind the PI evidence only showed he wasn't where he was supposed to be and that he was with my wife. She repeated a bunch of lies AP had told her.  He told her they only met recently and it was a one-time thing, it didn't mean anything and he wouldn't see her again. He must have said that minutes before showing up at our house!

I told her there was so much more, that I wasn't comfortable discussing it over the phone and asked if she'd like to meet. She was at her parents house with her son out in the country, in county Wicklow.  I figured I could use some fresh air, so I offered to go to her. It was kind of perfect, she had her parents to take care of the child and we could have some privacy while also not being alone in the house.

Wicklow is a beautiful county, very green, lots of forestry.  The house was only about a 90 minute drive from the city. I felt a wave of guilt when I met their son and her parents welcomed me, but we got down to business pretty quickly. I told her that every word her husband told her is a lie, but I didn't expect her to take my word for anything.

I pulled out my wife's old phone and let her peruse the messages. I told her they go back 3 years and that that also wasn't the start.  She was shocked by that and disgusted at the way they talked to each other.  She said he was never that crass with her. Then I played the VAR audio from the infidelity baseball exercise where my wife admitted to a 7-year long affair. That hit her hard and she took a deep breath. I let her know I had explicit video of two sexual encounters on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. She said she didn't want to see that but asked me to describe it at a high level.  I told her it was mostly what you'd expect except for the part where my wife pulled out a box of dildos and used one on him.  She looked like she was going to be sick. I didn't want to be crass, but I felt that little detail would be a nice cheap shot she could launch at him if he started getting nasty. From her reaction, I don't think this act was performed on him at home, but I didn't want to pry.  Finally, I played the VAR audio of her husband arriving at our house minutes after telling her he was done with her.

I said I was sorry I couldn't leave any of this evidence with her. I told her I'd let her know if anything else turned up on the VAR that she should know about.  

My next stop was a visit to the in-laws.  I wasn't ready to contact my wife yet, but to head off any missing person report and having the Gardai appear at my office, I decided this needed to happen. If her car was still there I was just going to keep driving. It wasn't.

I kept it simple. They offered me coffee and we sat down to chat. I asked if they had been talking to my wife. Her father said they had. I asked if they knew I was looking to separate from her. They both nodded. I asked if she had told them why. She had not.  I informed them that I caught her with another man while I was travelling for work last week.  I showed them the PI photos and accounts of this man visiting on Monday evening and then staying the night on Tuesday evening. Her father apologised to me and said he didn't raise her to be like that. Her mam asked how long this has been going on. I told her she admitted to a 7-year long affair. I told them we were getting a divorce, there was no coming back from this, and that by refusing to move out of the house, my wife was just costing us both money as I had to stay in a hotel and was entitled to use joint funds for that. I said there was no universe where I would be willing to continue living under the same roof as her and it was in her best interests to find somewhere else to stay until we can sell the place.  They agreed with this and said they'd talk to her.

I got home and found an email from my STBXW saying she will be willing to sign the separation agreement and move back to her parents place, but she wants us to meet and talk.  I haven't responded as of the tinme of writing (Monday evening).

At about midnight, I called home and told my parents what was happening. It was kind of emotional. I haven't been back there since before covid.  They were quite upset. I didn't tell them I was thinking of returning home just in case those plans change.

Now you're caught up.",102,1741647302.0,cheating_stories,47,0.98,False
