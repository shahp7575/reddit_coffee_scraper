1joovd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1joovd0/this_is_familiar/,This is familiar,"Hi, everyone. This is my first post on Reddit, and the first sub-Reddit I have ever belonged to.     I want to thank you all for having me and I apologize in advance for contributing something so lousy. 

I‚Äôll start with a brief contextualization. In the tenth grade, I started vaping. The reasons don‚Äôt really matter, but I picked it up innocently off of people I was trying to impress. After I had become addicted, I learned what a horrible mess I‚Äôd gotten myself into. I continued until late grade eleven with anxiety hounding me at all times. I feared for my health, I was paranoid about illness and shaken at every slight sign of something being wrong. I was ashamed of reaching out to my family. My friends all worshipped their vapes like deities, and despite all of the dread, so did I. I was underage and constantly stressing over ways to procure nicotine next. But I loved getting my new pods. I loved the flavours. I loved the colours. I loved the feeling in my lungs and in my hand. I loved the respite from hardships; I loved completing school, completing work and walking away with a trail of satisfied smoke. It was like a pat on the back. I loved vaping with coffee. I loved it with food. I just loved it always. 

And I still do. I quit on March 28th, 2023. Despite it being 2025, I don‚Äôt feel any safety or barrier from the time passed. The feelings I felt when I quit are always accessible, always lurking. 

The first week was a nightmare. I was having headaches. I was lethargic and distracted. And I was fucking crying. I was crying constantly, for no reason. I cried at everything. And slowly the crying faded into a background fog always just sitting behind my eyes. The sadness lingered. Whenever I saw my friends I was sad. When I left work I was sad. When I left school I was sad. Everything had become a part vaping as a whole, vaping as what made me whole. 

Months and months went by. I was still tortured on a daily basis. People were telling me by that point to just give up. But with the physical cravings gone all I mourned was the lifestyle. Instead I just got used to being depressed. I cut out those friends. I spent more time alone. I spent more time feeling like something was missing. I spent time jealous of strangers. Jealous of people I hated. Jealous of people I loved, and their freedom. Their ignorance. Their disregard. I wanted to be like them if it meant being reunited with my vape. But I was me, and I knew that with this body and mind I would always be torn apart by vaping.

I remained vape free for over a year. And at some point the time passing made me weaker. It made me forget the commitment I wanted to make to my body. I decided I didn‚Äôt care about my body if it was one hit or with friends. If it was one hit with my boyfriend. 

That was the summer before I started my first year of university. Now, I‚Äôm almost finished, in this complete backslide. I vape everyday. I fucking love it. I fucking hate myself. I‚Äôm afraid. I want more. And writing this, I‚Äôm lying in my bed crying. Again. And I thought, again, that this is so familiar. That I will probably find myself thinking that crying over a stupid little square of literal toxins and a deadly chemical is familiar until I‚Äôm a fully grown woman. That I will probably deal with this my whole life as someone with addiction issues. That I‚Äôll spend the rest of my life fighting against what I want.

So I‚Äôm just sad. I‚Äôm so sorry to put this here amidst all of these beautiful stories about people quitting and loving their lives, seeing the benefits, crawling their way back towards the light. You‚Äôre all amazing people. And you‚Äôre stronger than me. I wish you all the best and I thank you for lifting one another up.

I guess this post is for the people out there who feel the same as me. Who are just sad. If you‚Äôre out there, you‚Äôre not alone.",1,1743488163.0,QuitVaping,0,1.0,False

1joool0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1joool0/shes_showing_signs_but_cant_figure_out_whether/,She's showing signs but can't figure out whether she likes me or not... [Need help],"It's been a few months since I met her....

***First Meet:***

She's mutual friends with one of my very close friend and he randomly invited me to hangout with her and her friends, to which I just said yes, coz why not meet new people? And so went to a pub, the first time he introduced me I was kinda shy but I didn't show it, and she was SUPER CUTE, my first impression was ""bruh she's too cute for ya man, she won't fall for ya!"", she also called me ""bro"" when we first talked, so I was sure she isn't interested, she had bro zoned all the guys too, including my close friend (who introduced me to her) but she was very friendly with the boys and mostly enjoyed their company, I didn't even try to talk to her, we all were playing truth or dare and the only time I spoke was when it was my turn. Rest I didn't talk too much that day coz everyone except my close bud were people I had never met.

***Then we met a few other times...***

Fast forward a few weeks, we met each other quite often (again, it was my friend inviting me to hang out with her group) , we went to play badminton together, played snooker together, hung out a few times, got drunk etc. at that point I was pretty chill with the guys (her friends group was 4 guys and 2 girls including her) and I honestly enjoyed them boys' company, but for the girls though I never spoke much with them, especially with her, I barely had any conversation with her.

***She showed some signs...***

Then as we met more often, her behavior towards me slowly started changing... First I saw that she stopped calling me ""bro"" (she still calls all other guys as bro), she's been calling me as he/him/that guy, then many times I've seen her staring at me when I'm not looking and when I turn towards her she suddenly moves her eyes elsewhere to pretend that she's not looking, and whenever we hung out she would always sit exactly opposite to me (I think this was coincidental), she was very keenly listening when I spoke and would almost always comment or give her opinion on it, I'd sometimes laugh on my friend's silly jokes and she'd always laugh when I did (even though no one else was laughing). 

When we played badminton once I had got her in my team (we were playing duos) and we won two matches in a row so she came for a high-five, me being the dumbass I am took a few seconds to process that and I responded late she looked quite disappointed. 

Then another time we were in a pub, she asked for the cigarette I was smoking, I gave it to her, she took a few puffs then gave it back, although there were like 4 other people smoking the same thing she didn't ask them. 

Another day we were in a coffee shop grabbing our mid-day coffee, she was texting someone I guess but then I saw she was slowly pointing her phone's rear camera on me, I looked at the reflection on the glass behind her (it was quite blurry though) from what I saw she had taken a pic on snapchat and was searching for a filter.

And recently she had told my friend to ask me if I could teach her a programming language called Java (we both are CS students but from different universities and she asked coz my friend told about my good grades in college) to which I said ""I'll try"" but I didn't reach her out coz I'm shy :)

And there are a lot more subtle signs but



***Here's the confusing part...***

  
I've seen her quite a few times *supposedly dating* other guys, or idk probably they took her out coz she was cute and although she doesn't have a big friends circle, most of her friends are guys and she's not shy around guys, mostly enjoys male company, so I was guessing those signs didn't mean what I thought but my friend told me yesterday that she's actually single and she wants a guy and I asked him about how she is around other guys, and from what he described I'm guessing she isn't always like this with other guys...

I'm not able to understand what she means, I'm confused if whether I should go try to talk to her or not, please let me know your thoughts on this.

This summer, I‚Äôll be coming to the U.S. for the second time through the Work and Travel program from Croatia. I‚Äôll be spending four months working a summer job in Maine, and afterward, I‚Äôm (28M) planning a solo road trip across the country‚Äîfrom the West Coast to the East Coast‚Äîtraveling in a rented car.

The journey will begin in mid-October and last 24 days before I fly back home. Since this is my second time in the U.S. on the program, I‚Äôve already visited several major sights, including Acadia, Boston, New York, Las Vegas, Sequoia, the Grand Canyon, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Antelope Canyon, and Horseshoe Bend.

This time, my focus is on exploring nature and National Parks. Some of the places on my list include Zion, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Arches, Bryce Canyon, White Sands, the Rocky Mountains, Mount Rushmore, and Grand Teton. (I'll definitely buy National Park pass). My plan is to camp or sleep in my car along the way, keeping accommodation and other costs low (budget is around 5000$).

There‚Äôs a chance I might find someone adventurous enough to join me during the program, but for now, I‚Äôm planning to travel solo‚Äîon a budget, in a rented car. 

My trip starts in San Francisco (after a couple of days of sightseeing) and ends in Boston, but everything in between is open to suggestions! I have a rough itinerary planned, but I‚Äôd love to hear your recommendations on must-visit spots, road trip planning, and any other travel tips for exploring the U.S.

Looking forward to your advice!

TLDR 

* **Road trip:** San Francisco - Boston
* **Duration:** 24 days of breathtaking sights and existential crises
* **Who:** 28M from Croatia with a rented car, an unreasonable amount of optimism and Bachelor's Degree in Questionable Life Choices
* **Budget:** \~5000$ (which means luxury dining = instant ramen and gas station coffee)
* **Focus:** National parks and nature exploration, hikes and convincing myself that sleeping in a car is ""the full American road trip experience""
* **Looking for:** Must-visit spots, road trip tips and tricks, budget travel advice and clever ways to avoid bears and overpriced motels
* **Open to:** Suggestions & **a travel buddy who can tolerate my sick playlists, deep talks about the meaning of life, and occasional existential dread while car camping**",2,1743486467.0,roadtrip,0,1.0,False

My day consists of:

6am: Black coffee

8am: Black Tea

10am: keto electrolyte solution, NAC powder.
sometimes a black coffee with MCT oil.

12:30am: meat such as steak/lamb pork and 2 hard boiled eggs, sometimes a unflavoured ( that I salt myself with sea salt) pork scratchings/rinds.

1jood8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramTypeMe/comments/1jood8k/long_reflective_psychoanalysis_questionnaire_type/,"Long, reflective psychoanalysis questionnaire. Type me.","1. **What are your views on the good things in life? Do they happen naturally, or do you have to create them yourselfÔºüHow do they manifest into reality?**

The good things in life are not to be taken for granted. They are very real, whether they occurred by chance or through great effort. We should be open to enjoying them without growing too complacent or dependent, that goes for both versions of happy. I‚Äôm a person who, depending on health, has been quick to notice the negative or remain a ‚Äúrealist‚Äù both as a means of avoiding disappointment, but to also be open to being surprised.¬†

This doesn‚Äôt mean that I don't make an effort to cultivate happiness, but rather understanding you‚Äôre the only one who can make it happen for yourself and that the rest of it is truly at the whim of however the universe works. I don‚Äôt take ‚Äúbad‚Äù things personally but I do try to practice gratitude when the good is good.

You could be the richest, most powerful person and still be bogged down by the bad things, but you could also be the most downtrodden and penniless person and see the good. It‚Äôs truly subjective, and within that subjective opinion are the self assumed ‚Äúobjective‚Äù good things people assume¬† depending on the type of person you are.¬†

1. **What are your views on the bad things in life? What are the reasons they happen? How much control do you really have over such matters?**

Some bad things are very much within your power to avoid or work through, some not. I do think that unless it is direct and obvious, it is an impersonal thing that just happens to all of us. I do think that if we didn‚Äôt have good or bad then we wouldn‚Äôt have one without the other, which makes it crucial for us to have both. As it is with the good things, part of it very much is within your control while some things are not.

Does this mean that I would like bad things to happen? Of course not.

1. **How attached are you to your emotions? How often do you express them to others? What even is the purpose of such feelings? And what are the biases that impede your judgements?**

I have a hard time with my emotions, I feel like I physically feel them before I do experience them or realize I‚Äôm feeling them. I have a hard time with apparently being easy to read which in turn stresses me out more because I don‚Äôt like people making assumptions about my emotions before I understand them myself, I tend to compartmentalize them and try to understand them later, preferably when I‚Äôm alone.¬†

I could be frustrated, having tears fall without changing my expression or physically shaking and overwhelmed without knowing fully why until I‚Äôm given time to understand. I had trauma about many things which didn‚Äôt hit me until years later, whether it was brought back by some song or old material possession and I tend to isolate when this happens.¬†

I‚Äôm not one to open up or be upfront with people unless they ask, which I‚Äôm happy to be honest. I will say, I am fairly dry when I deliver them and fully explain myself because I don‚Äôt like being misunderstood or having assumptions made about what I think (I have been known to over-explain). However when I feel overwhelmed, my boundaries are being overstepped, there‚Äôs obvious disrespect or people constantly doubting my abilities or thought processes without asking and just assume I‚Äôm dumb. I will make it known that I don‚Äôt appreciate it and usually grow quiet or separate myself from the issue, obviously irritated.

I think emotions are very, very important for humanity. I do wish we made it a priority to teach emotional intelligence, especially empathy, within our society. Many of our conflicts, wars, unnecessary pain and suffering come from a place of emotion, out of fear, pain, anger, insecurity, etc. I do believe it is a part of what makes us human, to further the species and to create some sense of meaning or depth within our own short lived lives.¬†

I do tend to have some biases and snap judgments, ones that could even be felt in my own body, but I am able to separate from them and hear the other perspective. This is due to general curiosity, a yearning to know any blindspots I had not considered and for the possibility of seeing things in a completely different light- maybe even more accurate.¬†

I will say, I do have a hard time not reacting to criticism. It is a sore spot for me, I was constantly criticised growing up and find a sense of sharp irritation when people point it out, however gentle or constructive it is.

1. **What do you want in life? Are they achievable? If people and obstacles are in your way, what would you do then? With resources being limited, is it ok to acquire essential needs by denying them to someone else?**

I want to feel put together, to never be without anything necessary and to be able to get what I need without issues or setbacks. I do feel a tug and pull between having what would be necessary to live a healthy comfortable life, as well as feeling like there is deeper meaning, depth and importance within my life. This has led to me keeping from obtaining a higher education as I have a struggle between pursuing something that will allow me to live comfortably while also feeling that I am interested in said career.

I‚Äôm sure it's achievable, as frustrating as it is, nothing specific ever stood out to me so now it's a matter of trying various things and seeing what clicks. I've been a veterinary assistant, previously enrolled in college for environmental sciences, and nearly went into aerospace engineering.. All interesting, but not for me. When I was in my youth I simply wanted to travel around and learn about various cultures, customs and wonders of the world, I simply seek to understand everything.¬†

1. **Are people inherently good or bad? Or is it neither? What do you believe when it comes to moral goodness? What duties do we all have as individuals? Do we owe anything to each other by default?**

My thoughts are that it depends on various factors- upbringing, what we consider ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù and brain chemistry. People are vast and multifaceted, You could have someone raised on abuse grow into someone who advocates against helping those who‚Äôve faced similar, or those who continue the cycle. Yes, abuse is bad, but if it's all you‚Äôve known without any other perspective, you learn that it is how it is. However given the education, patience and compassion to see otherwise, if they then still continue the cycle, that is either a sign of being well established in the routine of abuse, perhaps a natural aptitude towards that behavior or literal years of wiring being undone and a defense mechanism to hold onto whatever it is they see as comfortable or normal and safe. There are many, many factors and I do not think the label of ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù captures the intricacies and grey areas.¬†

I think we all have the duty to survive. Our biological processes. To continue on. We are gifted with the unique ability to create, to enforce shared values besides basic survival, to think and if we so choose, to believe. I would say our duty is to come to our own understanding, to cultivate whatever depth we choose and to accept our own unique experiences of what ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù is in our own lives.

1. **Are you extroverted or introverted? If you're ambivert, when do you lean on each side? What excites you? What drains your energy? How do you feel alive when plagued by boredom and the mundane?**

Introverted. I don‚Äôt even share with or rarely see my friends, often planning days out or impromptu trips stress me out. I have a coworker I ride to work with some days and I feel bad at times for often preferring to sit alone with my own thoughts rather than engage. It doesn‚Äôt mean I dislike them, I just really, really enjoy my space. I often make myself get out of my comfort zone and at times make plans to sit down with my mother for coffee or to check out a new restaurant with a friend, even if i‚Äôd rather be doing something else, it feels like watering a plant. Necessary for health.

I can have periods of times where I‚Äôm fine with casual, passing conversation unless that person shares a common interest or something that intrigues me, then I‚Äôm willing to engage and often like to ask questions. This is often what excites me and draws me in. What often drains me are pointless conversations (although there can be beauty in small profound exchanges you never expected to stick with you, they're my favorite), parties, family events. I just enjoy my alone time with the occasional craving for something profound or meaningful, obligations based on expectations make it seem more like a chore.

When I‚Äôm plagued by boredom or the mundane, I can often find myself not knowing what to do with myself and aimlessly scroll on my phone to find things that interest me. If I'm to the point of not feeling alive or feeling so detached from myself, I can become the opposite of myself. I seek out anything, drugs, night outs with friends, frantically reading into interest after interest, overindulgence, etc. just to feel like I exist. Usually if I'm not healthy, boredom is more of a reminder of existential dread whereas when healthy, I take it as it is and utilize the time to hone a skill or try something new.

1. **What people/values/things do you hold dear to yourself? How do you prevent yourself from being separated from them? Does being disconnected scare you? Do you desire to fit in with the world?**

Always be open to change and learning, do no harm but don't allow yourself to be taken advantage of, take care of yourself because nobody else will, everyone should be responsible for themselves, we should have empathy and understanding for one another. Personally, I always seek to improve how my lifestyle is and seek to make things easier, so I can focus more on things that matter or hold my interest. I, as much as I may hate it, try to just wander around since that's when strange or interesting interactions in life tend to happen. Think of scripted events in games without the scripted part- it adds spice.

I prevent myself from straying far by trying to remember what I believe in the first place. I have a tug and pull relationship with an overwhelmed, doom jaded realist and someone who holds some sense of hope for humanity, some days tug from one side to the other.¬†

I do fear losing sight of some of these possibilities and held beliefs because I fear falling into the same trap it seems everyone can, apathy and going along with the way things are because there can‚Äôt be any use in enacting change. I would hate to think of being so simple minded to the point where I miss some important opportunities, possibilities or understandings of things.¬†

I don‚Äôt desire to fit into the world, although I do not actively try to be different. I just am and to me, it does not matter. I would, however, like to find a place to discuss or offer my findings, wisdom or perspective.

1. **What are the biggest disappointments you have? It doesn't even have to be something that happened to you personally. What is something you expected more from, but it somehow managed to fall short?**

When I was a child and grew up, it was things that I thought were common knowledge being.. Common knowledge. Instead of asserting my own (unless asked) I sought to question and understand these different ways of life, maybe even to see the strengths and weaknesses behind these perspectives and to fortify the ones in my own. Maybe.. also a little disappointing there‚Äôs no such things as grand adventures, or being chosen for life changing events with high stakes.

I expected things to be more fantastical, I guess. I feel we are very stuck in what is obvious and we need to move forward towards things that could lead to more fruition. I think we are stuck in our primal and emotional impulses, yet at the same time lack emotional intelligence.

1. What do you expect from others? Are you entitled to anything? Be it love or materialistic things. How easy is it to rely on others? To depend on something else outside of your control?

I expect nothing and I expect people don‚Äôt expect anything from me, unless I'm at work. Even with this expectation, I wouldn‚Äôt mind helping others, even If I am not obligated simply because it feels right to me. I am not entitled to anything from anybody, nor would I want anything handed to me because it feels as though there is an unsaid obligation or expectation.¬†

I have an insanely hard time depending on others. I want time to come to conclusions or the best course of action for myself unless I personally feel someone knows what they‚Äôre doing. I would never depend on anyone to take care of me and I often reject and resist help. It was so bad even as a child that I had to write reminders everywhere for me to see that would tell me to ask for help- it did nothing.

It‚Äôs not just maintaining autonomy, it's also because I often feel people won‚Äôt do things in the way I may prefer. If In order to get something it needs to be done in a way I find uncomfortable, I would rather not even do it. Dependence is just not in me. I don‚Äôt even like people being dependent on me because I don't want to risk disappointment, criticism and I often resist expectations.

1. **What are you as a person? How do you see yourself? How do others see you? How do you want others to see you? How do you want to see yourself?**

I am a person who seeks to understand. I like to consider many possibilities, to leave no stone unturned and to look past the boundaries and question ‚Äúand?‚Äù. I am a hopeful realist, I love reality and yet I reject it because it scares me. I wish I could give a better, more concrete answer to this but I just kind of am who I am.¬†

I like to see myself as reasonable, wise, polite, professional, graceful, educated, charming, curious, tinkering, understanding, capable, knowing, unbiased, objective yet warm.

Common words people use to describe me are professional, graceful, calm, ‚Äúold soul‚Äù, emotional, creative, analytical, reserved, good with people, and engaging.

I want to be seen as capable, put together, wise, knowledgeable, intelligent, living, knows what i'm doing, unquestionable, empathetic. The sage people would seek out guidance or education, wise but also realistic and hopeful.

1. **How do you organize your thoughts? What are concepts and ideas to you? How do you navigate through such a hazy frightening future? What do you believe are the most important questions one can ask?**

Drawing connections and trying to think back as to the cause of said emotion and thinking about why I would feel a certain way in response. Writing is good, however I often feel like my hand can't keep the pace with my brain, which is why typing is also nice. It helps me approach issues with the intention to fix them rather than panicking and worsening things, although I have had times where I'm easy to read and it leads to others reacting.

Concepts and ideas just pop in and out, I tend to write them down before they disappear and think on them if I‚Äôm not distracted or needing to focus. They are something to consider, understand and break into smaller pieces to understand or make into something tangible.¬†

I have a very hazy future, a general one, but still hazy. I will seek other routes or possibilities to make it clearer to myself and have been for a while. I‚Äôm not afraid, while I am open to ‚Äúfate‚Äù I do believe some things are within our control and will not let opportunities pass me by in blind faith.¬†

I believe the most important question you can ask is your own interpretation of the world. How it compares to objective truths. Why do you feel the need to do the things you choose to do?

1. **Are your instincts something to be trusted? Your first-impressions, or your natural intuition on things. How often, and when, are you on ""autopilot"" with your body? Doing things out of habit and muscle memory.**

I think it's possible to combine the two, while there is something to be said about intuition it can also lead to misunderstandings, unbiased assumptions and limiting understanding. I will feel my instinct, further assess why, whether it's reasonable and try to understand it wholly before I do anything with it to ensure the best way of dealing with it.¬†

With people, I usually try to give some cautious grace unless proven otherwise. That doesn‚Äôt mean I deny my instincts, but I do treat them with some healthy consideration.¬†

I'm on autopilot fairly often and usually in my own head, even while completing tasks or doing things. Sometimes I need to bring myself back down to what's currently happening in front of me. It can feel as though my mind and body at times are separate, so I do make efforts to try and connect the two before they separate even more. My brain and thoughts could go for hours, but sometimes I feel as though it gets burnt out or that it needs to cool down and I need to do so by doing something physical, simple and mindless.

We need to look beyond our primal wiring, while also remaining in touch with our humanity.¬†

Type me.","I made a post a week ago sharing memes in which I related to, I did not expect it to garner so much attention and found it interesting how so many people could interpret different types just from a few images. 

Now.. I am new to this system and I have been making an effort to read through each description (Mainly in depth with the ones people suggested) and found that few enacted some relatability. My suspicions are 5,4,6 and possibly 9. I am hoping posting this will make me consider a few other possibilities as these answers do give a better idea as to how my mind works, why, how, etc. and I would love questions. 

**What are your views on the good things in life? Do they happen naturally, or do you have to create them yourselfÔºüHow do they manifest into reality?**

The good things in life are not to be taken for granted. They are very real, whether they occurred by chance or through great effort. We should be open to enjoying them without growing too complacent or dependent, that goes for both versions of happy. I‚Äôm a person who, depending on health, has been quick to notice the negative or remain a ‚Äúrealist‚Äù both as a means of avoiding disappointment, but to also be open to being surprised.¬†

This doesn‚Äôt mean that I don't make an effort to cultivate happiness, but rather understanding you‚Äôre the only one who can make it happen for yourself and that the rest of it is truly at the whim of however the universe works. I don‚Äôt take ‚Äúbad‚Äù things personally but I do try to practice gratitude when the good is good.

You could be the richest, most powerful person and still be bogged down by the bad things, but you could also be the most downtrodden and penniless person and see the good. It‚Äôs truly subjective, and within that subjective opinion are the self assumed ‚Äúobjective‚Äù good things people assume¬† depending on the type of person you are.¬†

1. **What are your views on the bad things in life? What are the reasons they happen? How much control do you really have over such matters?**

Some bad things are very much within your power to avoid or work through, some not. I do think that unless it is direct and obvious, it is an impersonal thing that just happens to all of us. I do think that if we didn‚Äôt have good or bad then we wouldn‚Äôt have one without the other, which makes it crucial for us to have both. As it is with the good things, part of it very much is within your control while some things are not.

Does this mean that I would like bad things to happen? Of course not.

1. **How attached are you to your emotions? How often do you express them to others? What even is the purpose of such feelings? And what are the biases that impede your judgements?**

I have a hard time with my emotions, I feel like I physically feel them before I do experience them or realize I‚Äôm feeling them. I have a hard time with apparently being easy to read which in turn stresses me out more because I don‚Äôt like people making assumptions about my emotions before I understand them myself, I tend to compartmentalize them and try to understand them later, preferably when I‚Äôm alone.¬†

I could be frustrated, having tears fall without changing my expression or physically shaking and overwhelmed without knowing fully why until I‚Äôm given time to understand. I had trauma about many things which didn‚Äôt hit me until years later, whether it was brought back by some song or old material possession and I tend to isolate when this happens.¬†

I‚Äôm not one to open up or be upfront with people unless they ask, which I‚Äôm happy to be honest. I will say, I am fairly dry when I deliver them and fully explain myself because I don‚Äôt like being misunderstood or having assumptions made about what I think (I have been known to over-explain). However when I feel overwhelmed, my boundaries are being overstepped, there‚Äôs obvious disrespect or people constantly doubting my abilities or thought processes without asking and just assume I‚Äôm dumb. I will make it known that I don‚Äôt appreciate it and usually grow quiet or separate myself from the issue, obviously irritated.

I think emotions are very, very important for humanity. I do wish we made it a priority to teach emotional intelligence, especially empathy, within our society. Many of our conflicts, wars, unnecessary pain and suffering come from a place of emotion, out of fear, pain, anger, insecurity, etc. I do believe it is a part of what makes us human, to further the species and to create some sense of meaning or depth within our own short lived lives.¬†

I do tend to have some biases and snap judgments, ones that could even be felt in my own body, but I am able to separate from them and hear the other perspective. This is due to general curiosity, a yearning to know any blind spots I had not considered and for the possibility of seeing things in a completely different light- maybe even more accurate.¬†

I will say, I do have a hard time not reacting to criticism. It is a sore spot for me, I was constantly criticised growing up and find a sense of sharp irritation when people point it out, however gentle or constructive it is.

1. **What do you want in life? Are they achievable? If people and obstacles are in your way, what would you do then? With resources being limited, is it ok to acquire essential needs by denying them to someone else?**

I want to feel put together, to never be without anything necessary and to be able to get what I need without issues or setbacks. I do feel a tug and pull between having what would be necessary to live a healthy comfortable life, as well as feeling like there is deeper meaning, depth and importance within my life. This has led to me keeping from obtaining a higher education as I have a struggle between pursuing something that will allow me to live comfortably while also feeling that I am interested in said career.

I‚Äôm sure it's achievable, as frustrating as it is, nothing specific ever stood out to me so now it's a matter of trying various things and seeing what clicks. I've been a veterinary assistant, previously enrolled in college for environmental sciences, and nearly went into aerospace engineering.. All interesting, but not for me. When I was in my youth I simply wanted to travel around and learn about various cultures, customs and wonders of the world, I simply seek to understand everything.¬†

1. **Are people inherently good or bad? Or is it neither? What do you believe when it comes to moral goodness? What duties do we all have as individuals? Do we owe anything to each other by default?**

My thoughts are that it depends on various factors- upbringing, what we consider ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù and brain chemistry. People are vast and multifaceted, You could have someone raised on abuse grow into someone who advocates against helping those who‚Äôve faced similar, or those who continue the cycle. Yes, abuse is bad, but if it's all you‚Äôve known without any other perspective, you learn that it is how it is. However given the education, patience and compassion to see otherwise, if they then still continue the cycle, that is either a sign of being well established in the routine of abuse, perhaps a natural aptitude towards that behavior or literal years of wiring being undone and a defense mechanism to hold onto whatever it is they see as comfortable or normal and safe. There are many, many factors and I do not think the label of ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù captures the intricacies and grey areas.¬†

I think we all have the duty to survive. Our biological processes. To continue on. We are gifted with the unique ability to create, to enforce shared values besides basic survival, to think and if we so choose, to believe. I would say our duty is to come to our own understanding, to cultivate whatever depth we choose and to accept our own unique experiences of what ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù is in our own lives.

1. **Are you extroverted or introverted? If you're ambivert, when do you lean on each side? What excites you? What drains your energy? How do you feel alive when plagued by boredom and the mundane?**

Introverted. I don‚Äôt even share with or rarely see my friends, often planning days out or impromptu trips stress me out. I have a coworker I ride to work with some days and I feel bad at times for often preferring to sit alone with my own thoughts rather than engage. It doesn‚Äôt mean I dislike them, I just really, really enjoy my space. I often make myself get out of my comfort zone and at times make plans to sit down with my mother for coffee or to check out a new restaurant with a friend, even if i‚Äôd rather be doing something else, it feels like watering a plant. Necessary for health.

I can have periods of times where I‚Äôm fine with casual, passing conversation unless that person shares a common interest or something that intrigues me, then I‚Äôm willing to engage and often like to ask questions. This is often what excites me and draws me in. What often drains me are pointless conversations (although there can be beauty in small profound exchanges you never expected to stick with you, they're my favorite), parties, family events. I just enjoy my alone time with the occasional craving for something profound or meaningful, obligations based on expectations make it seem more like a chore.

When I‚Äôm plagued by boredom or the mundane, I can often find myself not knowing what to do with myself and aimlessly scroll on my phone to find things that interest me. If I'm to the point of not feeling alive or feeling so detached from myself, I can become the opposite of myself. I seek out anything, drugs, night outs with friends, frantically reading into interest after interest, overindulgence, etc. just to feel like I exist. Usually if I'm not healthy, boredom is more of a reminder of existential dread whereas when healthy, I take it as it is and utilize the time to hone a skill or try something new.

1. **What people/values/things do you hold dear to yourself? How do you prevent yourself from being separated from them? Does being disconnected scare you? Do you desire to fit in with the world?**

Always be open to change and learning, do no harm but don't allow yourself to be taken advantage of, take care of yourself because nobody else will, everyone should be responsible for themselves, we should have empathy and understanding for one another. Personally, I always seek to improve how my lifestyle is and seek to make things easier, so I can focus more on things that matter or hold my interest. I, as much as I may hate it, try to just wander around since that's when strange or interesting interactions in life tend to happen. Think of scripted events in games without the scripted part- it adds spice.

I prevent myself from straying far by trying to remember what I believe in the first place. I have a tug and pull relationship with an overwhelmed, doom jaded realist and someone who holds some sense of hope for humanity, some days tug from one side to the other.¬†

I do fear losing sight of some of these possibilities and held beliefs because I fear falling into the same trap it seems everyone can, apathy and going along with the way things are because there can‚Äôt be any use in enacting change. I would hate to think of being so simple minded to the point where I miss some important opportunities, possibilities or understandings of things.¬†

I don‚Äôt desire to fit into the world, although I do not actively try to be different. I just am and to me, it does not matter. I would, however, like to find a place to discuss or offer my findings, wisdom or perspective.

1. **What are the biggest disappointments you have? It doesn't even have to be something that happened to you personally. What is something you expected more from, but it somehow managed to fall short?**

When I was a child and grew up, it was things that I thought were common knowledge being.. Common knowledge. Instead of asserting my own (unless asked) I sought to question and understand these different ways of life, maybe even to see the strengths and weaknesses behind these perspectives and to fortify the ones in my own. Maybe.. also a little disappointing there‚Äôs no such things as grand adventures, or being chosen for life changing events with high stakes.

I expected things to be more fantastical, I guess. I feel we are very stuck in what is obvious and we need to move forward towards things that could lead to more fruition. I think we are stuck in our primal and emotional impulses, yet at the same time lack emotional intelligence.

1. What do you expect from others? Are you entitled to anything? Be it love or materialistic things. How easy is it to rely on others? To depend on something else outside of your control?

I expect nothing and I expect people don‚Äôt expect anything from me, unless I'm at work. Even with this expectation, I wouldn‚Äôt mind helping others, even If I am not obligated simply because it feels right to me. I am not entitled to anything from anybody, nor would I want anything handed to me because it feels as though there is an unsaid obligation or expectation.¬†

I have an insanely hard time depending on others. I want time to come to conclusions or the best course of action for myself unless I personally feel someone knows what they‚Äôre doing. I would never depend on anyone to take care of me and I often reject and resist help. It was so bad even as a child that I had to write reminders everywhere for me to see that would tell me to ask for help- it did nothing.

It‚Äôs not just maintaining autonomy, it's also because I often feel people won‚Äôt do things in the way I may prefer. If In order to get something it needs to be done in a way I find uncomfortable, I would rather not even do it. Dependence is just not in me. I don‚Äôt even like people being dependent on me because I don't want to risk disappointment, criticism and I often resist expectations.

1. **What are you as a person? How do you see yourself? How do others see you? How do you want others to see you? How do you want to see yourself?**

I am a person who seeks to understand. I like to consider many possibilities, to leave no stone unturned and to look past the boundaries and question ‚Äúand?‚Äù. I am a hopeful realist, I love reality and yet I reject it because it scares me. I wish I could give a better, more concrete answer to this but I just kind of am who I am.¬†

I like to see myself as reasonable, wise, polite, professional, graceful, educated, charming, curious, tinkering, understanding, capable, knowing, unbiased, objective yet warm.

Common words people use to describe me are professional, graceful, calm, ‚Äúold soul‚Äù, emotional, creative, analytical, reserved, good with people, and engaging.

I want to be seen as capable, put together, wise, knowledgeable, intelligent, living, knows what i'm doing, unquestionable, empathetic. The sage people would seek out guidance or education, wise but also realistic and hopeful.

1. **How do you organize your thoughts? What are concepts and ideas to you? How do you navigate through such a hazy frightening future? What do you believe are the most important questions one can ask?**

Drawing connections and trying to think back as to the cause of said emotion and thinking about why I would feel a certain way in response. Writing is good, however I often feel like my hand can't keep the pace with my brain, which is why typing is also nice. It helps me approach issues with the intention to fix them rather than panicking and worsening things, although I have had times where I'm easy to read and it leads to others reacting.

Concepts and ideas just pop in and out, I tend to write them down before they disappear and think on them if I‚Äôm not distracted or needing to focus. They are something to consider, understand and break into smaller pieces to understand or make into something tangible.¬†

I have a very hazy future, a general one, but still hazy. I will seek other routes or possibilities to make it clearer to myself and have been for a while. I‚Äôm not afraid, while I am open to ‚Äúfate‚Äù I do believe some things are within our control and will not let opportunities pass me by in blind faith.¬†

I believe the most important question you can ask is your own interpretation of the world. How it compares to objective truths. Why do you feel the need to do the things you choose to do?

1. **Are your instincts something to be trusted? Your first-impressions, or your natural intuition on things. How often, and when, are you on ""autopilot"" with your body? Doing things out of habit and muscle memory.**

I think it's possible to combine the two, while there is something to be said about intuition it can also lead to misunderstandings, unbiased assumptions and limiting understanding. I will feel my instinct, further assess why, whether it's reasonable and try to understand it wholly before I do anything with it to ensure the best way of dealing with it.¬†

With people, I usually try to give some cautious grace unless proven otherwise. That doesn‚Äôt mean I deny my instincts, but I do treat them with some healthy consideration.¬†

I'm on autopilot fairly often and usually in my own head, even while completing tasks or doing things. Sometimes I need to bring myself back down to what's currently happening in front of me. It can feel as though my mind and body at times are separate, so I do make efforts to try and connect the two before they separate even more. My brain and thoughts could go for hours, but sometimes I feel as though it gets burnt out or that it needs to cool down and I need to do so by doing something physical, simple and mindless.

We need to look beyond our primal wiring, while also remaining in touch with our humanity.¬†

This guy that I've been friends with since I started college has just been friends with me. Talking whenever I see him, texting etc etc. I even gave him some clothes every so often just if I was going to donate it. But a few days ago we had a craft Faire on campus, the night before I went to pickup dinner and he was in the cafe area, just talking and such. I had mentioned that this payday was shitty and I was going to try to buy something specifically a flower crown. He started pushing hard that he would buy it, he'd give  me the money etc etc and even refused when I said I'd pay him back. I didn't think too much about it but when I brought it up to my roommate she started asking if I liked him back. I'm neurodivergent as fuck did I miss a sign?? He might be single now but I don't know. How would I even ask about that if he is single? 
 

Might just be an idiot here, I'm genuinely bad at social cues when it comes to stuff like this. Most other cues I'm good at. I'm AFAB (born female ) 20 and he's 20 too

* The one-minute opening montage of their journey from pre-Rust trial to post-Rust trial features many, many, many flavors of Hillary‚Äôs pretend accent/affection. It runs the gamut from wanna-be Pen√©lope Cruz to light Caribbean to South American inflected English. It‚Äôs all fake, obviously, but to clip it together in the way they did was a whole choice.

* Hillary casually says that she wants to send Cappuccina (the black dog) home with her assistant/paid friend Yoel *‚Äújust for a few months so he can train her.‚Äù* Alec replies *‚ÄúNo. Why? Are you kidding? No, I want Cappuccina with us. I want her in another house, but I want her with us‚Äù* as Hillary cackles.
* Couch Hillary: (starts with a Boston accent)*‚Äúwhat we‚Äôve been through the past years has been traumatic and so I‚Äôm folding my children and folding Alec into the good and the kind and the positive* (remembers to fake it til she makes it and the accent kicks in) *because that‚Äôs the thing that‚Äôs going to help us to heal, to get to be a little bit more stable, less shaky, to start to take on everything that we‚Äôve had to put on hold for quite¬† few years.‚Äù*
* Hillary and Maril√∫ (captioned as *‚ÄúMar√≠a Lulu‚Äù*) give a dog some treats and Hillary coaches ML to say, *‚Äúgood girl!‚Äù* ‚Äì it appears the dog is not bilingual.
* Couch Hilz: (sounding so American that she could have captained the Mayflower) *‚ÄúAlec and I had two dogs before we had children and now I have Cappuccina and Macchiata and it‚Äôs like I feel like they‚Äù* ‚Äì laughs as the dogs start barking loudly.

* Now the whole family is outside, and Hillary is asking ML how they should housetrain the dogs. The child is confused as am I, because how would poor ML know what to say?
* Hillary wraps herself up in her Spanish flag towel with *‚ÄúLos Baldwinitos‚Äù* emblazoned on it to remind all and sundry that she speaks Spanish and has 7 kids with Alec Baldwin.

* They have this exchange about hiring a dog trainer with poor Romeo present:

   * A: ""*What's your surprise?""*
   * H: *‚ÄúI‚Äôm having another baby.‚Äù* Romeo looks genuinely shocked as Alec is stone-faced and Hillary shrieks with laughter. She tells him she‚Äôs kidding and wants to hire a dog trainer.
   * A: *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one who brought those dogs into the house and said they were trained.‚Äù*
   * H: *‚ÄúNo, they were trained and then untrained.‚Äù*
   * A: *‚ÄúDog trainer? All for it.‚Äù*
   * H: *‚ÄúWhat would you want a dog trainer to teach the dogs?‚Äù* Is she for real? Like could they teach the dogs to fetch Alec‚Äôs allergy meds because he lives with a bunch of cats he‚Äôs allergic to?
   * A: *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt whiz on my $40,000 hand-knitted Parisian rug?‚Äù*
   * H: *‚ÄúWhy are you spending $40,000 on a rug?‚Äù* Fair question.
   * A: *‚ÄúI was huge back then; I made so much money.‚Äù* Fair answer. ¬†
   * H: *‚ÄúI know, this is a very old rug.‚Äù* Was she actually‚Ä¶witty? Jury‚Äôs still out.
* Then they move from boring talk about the expensive rug to boring talk about the destroyed playroom rug they‚Äôve been meaning to change ‚Äúfor years.‚Äù ¬†I kid you not we watch Hillary and Alec argue about the right way to measure the space for a new rug.
* **The one faintly interesting nugget is Couch Hillary saying: (no accent)** ***‚ÄúI used to do things very much the way that Alec wanted them. I used to. And I lived with tremendous anxiety, tremendous stress*** ***and I almost felt like I was like a kid in an adult‚Äôs home, I don‚Äôt want I say parent cuz that sounds weird*** **(laughs)** ***but, y‚Äôknow, somebody‚Äôs home and you‚Äôre kinda like, y‚Äôknow, I didn‚Äôt feel like it was my home. But that was many years ago.‚Äù*** **Back to them bickering about how to measure the space.**
* Random notes:
   * Alec calls her *‚Äúeee-LAH-ree-uh‚Äù* and they both ignore Maril√∫ who looks at the crew for help because she‚Äôs telling her obtuse parents her toy doesn‚Äôt work and they just talk over her.
   * Hilz says her ADHD makes her *‚Äúinclusive‚Äù* but also very creative. Ma‚Äôam, include some solid parenting and common sense and we might believe you.
   * When Hillary is in her Bratz buns black outfit for her couch interview, her accent goes into hyper mode.
* I have never been happier to get to a commercial break in my life but when we return to the show, they are STILL talking about the frickin playroom rug. Alec insists it should be 14‚Äôx12‚Äô and Hillary glares at him as if he had suggested they just lay down some hay on the floor and call it a day.

* Hillary is looking at online options and Alec huffs: *‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs more stupid than buying things online, really for things of some aesthetic? We‚Äôre gonna go to the carpet store and you‚Äôre gonna hold it in your hand. I don‚Äôt buy anything online except my cans of dog food or am I wrong.‚Äù*
* Hillary: *‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm litra-lee getting it all wrong‚Äù* (uh, how about you get that word right, sis?). Hillary flips him off and he laughs and takes a picture of her. They both agree she‚Äôs going to do whatever she wants. ¬†

**A New ‚ÄúF‚Äù: Flight, Flight, Freeze, Fun**

* Another day of Alec and Hillary in their beautiful backyard and Hillary is whining about how little fun they‚Äôve had lately:
   * H: *‚ÄúWe lived for so long with this stress, I was thinking that we could start do things‚Ä¶‚Äù*
   * Alec: *‚ÄúThat you want‚Äù*
   * H: *‚Äú‚Ä¶that we haven‚Äôt done before. Part of that is I came into your life and went to all the Philharmonic concerts. ¬†I spent the last 13 years doing a lot of your things. I think you should come into my world, and we should do something fun‚Äù* (snaps her fingers and does a shimmy)
   * A: *‚ÄúSuch as?‚Äù*
   * H: ‚ÄúI think we should go dancing. I wanna take you salsa dancing with me‚Äù (a bouncy cha-cha plays softly) ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs do something fun!‚Äù
   * A: *‚ÄúAre you proposing to me?‚Äù*
   * H: *‚ÄúI want you to go dancing with me. You actually, you have very good rhythm, you have very good movement‚Äù* (more shimmying)

   * H: *‚ÄúYou have the passion‚Äù* (‚Äúdances‚Äù in her seat) *‚ÄúYou have the ability to laugh and have fun‚Äù* (they both dance in their seats).
   * A: ‚Äú*I don‚Äôt want to go but I will go because of you. I mean, I never thought that at my age I‚Äôd go dancing with my stunning wife, my smoking hot wife, life is good, life is good. I‚Äôd love to, I mean God, I wish I was one billionth as talented as you are at that, you‚Äôre so good, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù*
   * H: *‚ÄúI‚Äôm ok. You could take a dance class with me then we when we go back to the city, that could be our new Friday nights. We give the kids pizza and sushi, because Friday nights is pizza sushi, and then we‚Äôll go dancing‚Äù* (more jerky movements)
   * A: (in an exaggerated Spanish accent) *‚ÄúI think we should go salsa dancing‚Äù*

[They had better moves here than in the dance studio.](https://preview.redd.it/0aczdamvp5se1.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=235ef39b17c7b6f4c6c039d72a403670d6d0327d)

* Three different Couch Hillarys and voice overs were needed to produce this soundbite\*: ‚ÄúThe new word for the future is fun. Flight, flight, freeze, and now we‚Äôre doing fun. The struggles are different every day. The trick with Alec is Alec lives in a land of love and nurturing that wants to take care of other people. Of course, it‚Äôs Alec and he‚Äôs always going to put himself last, but I want him to be happy. I think that Alec was living with stress for such a long time that it stole our laughter and we want him to know that he is worth taking care of, he's worth being happy.‚Äù\*
* Producer asks Edu and Marilu: *‚ÄúWho‚Äôs a better dancer, mom or dad?‚Äù* Marilu: *‚ÄúMe.‚Äù* God bless this little one.
* Cut to lots of videos of the kids dancing through the years thankfully set to disco music not Gypsy Kings or Bad Bunny.

**Dog Training**

* Gail, the no-nonsense-looking dog trainer, arrives and looks at the mountain of shoes in the entryway quizzically as the dogs bark loudly at her.
* **Couch Hillary says with a straight face:** ***‚ÄúWe only have a few weeks before the end of summer and we have a lot that we need to do. We need to get the dogs potty trained. We need to figure out the rugs. We still have A LOT that is going to happen this summer.‚Äù*** **I‚Äôm tickled, at this point. This lady is flat out bananas.**
* Hillary introduces Gail to Alec who is walking in his with his hands full with a newspaper and an iced coffee and shakes her hand and says, *‚Äúmy pants are falling off.‚Äù* ¬†He says loudly, *‚Äúwhat I want to know is, can you tell from looking at a dog right away whether they‚Äôre hopeless and they‚Äôre never gonna be trained or they have hope? Can you just look at a dog and know if they‚Äôre hopeless?‚Äù*
* Hillary laughs and Alec says, *‚ÄúI‚Äôm joking.‚Äù* Gail does not look amused and says *‚ÄúUm,no. And I think there‚Äôs hope for everybody.‚Äù*
* Alec jokes *‚Äúcan you train the kids?‚Äù* Gail calmly responds, *‚Äúpositive reinforcement works for kids, too.‚Äù* ¬†Can we get some Team Gail shirts made? ¬†
* Gail gives them advice and then they ask about housetraining:
   * Hillary: *‚Äúit‚Äôs on a level of bad and they weren‚Äôt like this.‚Äù*
   * Alec: *‚ÄúI love this rug and we have to throw it out now‚Äù* (cut to dog poo sitting on the $40K rug)
   * Hillary: *‚ÄúThis rug also we had two dogs before that were not good, then we had kids, and they had a hard with it.‚Äù* So, their older dogs weren‚Äôt housebroken either? Actually, what am I saying - WHO CARES??
* Gail recommends crating, but Alec interrupts telling her he wants to take a picture of her because he wants her haircut. Cut to Alec doing an impression of Steven Van Zandt talking about how people admire Alec‚Äôs hair. ¬†

[Here‚Äôs hoping Gail charged an arm and a leg for this waste of her time.](https://preview.redd.it/97dyafndq5se1.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ed42bfed433525ca2a6f1448492ec03000014bc)

* Hillary and Leo don‚Äôt like crating but try it and put both small dogs into one small crate. I don‚Äôt know if this is right or wrong but cannot muster the interest to Google.

**Carmen and Alec Bit = ‚ÄúCarmen‚Äôs Lessons in Slang‚Äù**

* Carmen quizzes Alec on Gen Alpha slang and it‚Äôs as bad as you think. She‚Äôs annoying and rude, he‚Äôs barely awake and marginally invested. The amount of makeup on Carmen is alarming.

**Dancing with The Former Star and His Useless Wife**

* Let me preface this by saying my family is from Cali, Colombia, also known as the salsa capital of the world, so watching this segment was beyond painful. Even the chipper ‚ÄúLatin music‚Äù they played in the opening rubbed me the wrong way.
* Of course, we get Hillary humble bragging about dancing since the age of two: *‚Äúit‚Äôs always something that‚Äôs part of me and I‚Äôm grateful Alec wants to take a dancing class with me.‚Äù* He wants no part of this, you pudding head.
* They enter the dance studio and Jacob, the dance instructor, asks politely, *‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù* Alec booms, *‚Äúgood, we‚Äôre going to, uh, dance.‚Äù* Jacob follows up with *‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your dance experience?‚Äù* Alec replies *‚ÄúOf course I won three Tony awards on Broadway for my dance experience.‚Äù* Jacob laughs politely and a caption informs viewers *‚ÄúThis is not true.‚Äù*
* **Hillary butts in:** ***‚ÄúCan I tell you, I feel like if I knew him, I‚Äôd be like oh he can‚Äôt dance. But he‚Äôs got some rhythm.‚Äù*** **What in the not Spanish blazes is she saying?**
* Jacob informs them they will be dancing New York style salsa, and the camera focuses on Hillary‚Äôs feet as she does a rumba walk. Ballroom isn‚Äôt salsa, but ok.
* J[acob and Hillary dance first and it looks meh, she clearly makes mistakes but laughs it off](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1jod8vh/the_dancing_scene_when_he_is_doing_her_voice_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
* Couch Alec says, *‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to go and live, and do whatever we want to do.‚Äù* Nice that Halyna‚Äôs death isn‚Äôt inconveniencing them anymore, no?
* Jacob tries to teach them a simple arm move called drapes and [Hillary‚Äôs multi fluid brain enters the chat](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1jod8vh/the_dancing_scene_when_he_is_doing_her_voice_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button):
   * H: *‚Äúdu ju wan me tu force ju tu do eet?‚Äù*

   * H: *‚ÄúI‚Äôll force ju tu do eet‚Äù*
   * A: ‚Äú*I thought you said I‚Äôll divorce you‚Äù*
   * H: (no accent) *‚ÄúOh no, I‚Äôll force you, that‚Äôs tomorrow.‚Äù*
   * A: (in heavy Spanish accent) *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna go to court and go: he can‚Äôt dance! It‚Äôs been 13 years and he don‚Äôt even try.‚Äù*
* Hillary meant she could ‚Äúforce‚Äù him by guiding his hand to where it was meant to go. She screws it up by guiding him to the wrong position, Jacob tries to help, Alec goofs around yelling *‚ÄúI‚Äôm the king of the drapery!‚Äù* while Jacobs is like *‚Äúit‚Äôs drapes.‚Äù* A. Mess.

[She taught him the move all wrong.](https://preview.redd.it/ntou5r8yq5se1.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d3c9686e661313536f1b6aa2a09ef521a3215ce)

* Couch Alec says, *‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get it right. Not once. I messed it up entirely. Shit!‚Äù*
* They finally danced together; he was stiff, and she didn‚Äôt follow the music, but they looked like they enjoyed themselves. The editors give Hillary a slo-mo effect and zoomed in lovingly on her face. ¬†In the car after the lesson, Alec tells Hillary she was ‚Äúbreathtaking‚Äù and ‚Äúamazing‚Äù just as her parents probably did her whole life and this is why this cuckoo is how she is.
* Alec says he‚Äôll call in a favor to get her on ‚ÄúDancing with the Stars‚Äù and she replies *‚ÄúI litra-lee won‚Äôt. I haff seben keeds. I jus wan to haff fun.‚Äù*

[The way their clothes never quite fit is baffling. ](https://preview.redd.it/5312h2c3r5se1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=040aea5848f325fc2b568fbd2ec9c5e4d6789a2f)

**Yoel and the Stupid Rug**

* Hillary says Alec wants a specific size for the playroom rug because of his OCD. Of course, she ordered something different and this whole thing is supposed to be madcap and zany, so Hilz enlists Yoel (captioned as her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù) and they heave furniture about and generally create chaos. She also tells Yoel the rug was a bargain at $200.
* The kids arrive from camp and she and Yoel jokingly say ""you guys better clean up this mess you left behind!""I felt bad for poor Rafa who looked really confused about why the kids had to clean. When Leo and Romeo complain she says *‚Äúlitra-lee, litra-lee I‚Äôm cleaning all the time‚Äù* Carmen sits and refuses to help, Romeo says repeatedly the rug smells bad and this is the lowest stakes most insipid garbage TV I have ever watched, and I‚Äôve watched a lot of trashy TV. 
* Hillary claims Alec is upset but he‚Äôs fine. The rug is fine. They sit in the playroom and Hillary‚Äôs flimsy tank top is the only thing struggling in this scene.

[Maybe they should have done a segment on Hillary's hair which looks as distressed as the rugs.](https://preview.redd.it/u5kx2ep7u5se1.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=433fba853216b06526790fb4d2563c1786d84ae3)

* Alec proves he know how to pronounce ‚ÄúHilaria‚Äù in Spanish when he says *‚ÄúOne day I‚Äôm gonna be dead and you‚Äôll be with your next boyfriend, and you‚Äôll be crying and he‚Äôs gonna go* (accent) *what is the matter? Your boyfriend from Italy or wherever you find your young boyfriend, he gonna go Hilaria, what is the matter, qu√© es el problema? And you‚Äôre gonna go I miss Alec organizing the toys‚Äù* (pretends to cry). Does he know Italy and Spain are different places? Does he know Hillary Lynn is from neither or those places?
* Alec politely asks the crew to leave the playroom and not film him performing his ‚Äúorganization magic.‚Äù ¬†
* The kids play on their giant water slide in their amazing house and why are we watching a show about these plonkers complaining about how hard they have it? Couch Alec says, *‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt be doing this with better person.‚Äù* Actually, my guy, you 100% could be. Like any random lady at the coffee shop in the Hamptons would make a better partner.
* As salsa music plays ,Hillary claims when she met Alec she talked to the universe and said, *‚ÄúI need to have somebody who is like exciting and doing good in the world, doing fun things and then the universe came and brought you to me and I haven‚Äôt been bored at all.‚Äù* Girl, the universe loves a good joke. Cut to them dancing a clunky box step in the kitchen.
* The preview for next week shows Hillary telling her designer/paid friend *‚ÄúI got a procedure‚Äù* so maybe she addresses the new rock-hard bewbs but I am so bored she could reveal a third bewb and I wouldn‚Äôt care at this point.

I did try a Starbucks Frappuccino once and was utterly disappointed. 

I have compiled a list of all major/popular coffee roasters who offer samplers, in order of price/gm (excl. any offers):

Which roaster did you have a good experience with? For starters, which one would you recommend? I plan to use a Moka Pot and have a C2 grinder. Apart from variety and richness in flavour profiles, what I think should matter is consistency in quality and roasting over time, and be not too expensive. 

On a different note, what is the impact of harvest date (not roast date) on taste of coffee? The Corridor7 sampler beans are harvest dated 2021-22. Would it be bad tasting coffee?

I (34M) was the middle child of 3, and from day one... my mother never wanted me. I spent my entire childhood constantly being told that I was the ugliest baby in the world and I should have just been left in the woods.
My mother tried to sell me to a nurse for $10 the day I was born so she could get a hit of whatever narcotic she could get ahold of. I spent the first year of my life living at my grandparents house because she refused to acknowledge my existence. She abandoned me on the Seattle waterfront when I was three years old and left me for dead. When that didn't work; she force fed me alcohol, duct taped me to a coffee table and  whored me out to pedophiles to feed her drug habits, not giving a flying fuck what happened to me. 
Throughout my life I was always trying to help her to change her ways; buying her food, paying her bills, bailing her out of jail, etc... but nothing was ever enough. The more I gave, the more she expected... then I grew up.
After growing up and having a life of my own and not having any contact for 10 years, out of nowhere she tried to just waltz back into my life acting like she had never done anything wrong in her entire existence. She was constantly demanding money from me. She wrote to me in boot camp (sister gave her the details) literally demanding half of my paycheck. When she learned how much the life insurance payout was for active duty, she demanded that I hurry up and die because she felt entitled to money. This bitch even had the balls to harass my pregnant wife while I was deployed, demanding full access to my bank accounts.
When she finally got the hint that she wasn't going to receive a single penny out of me, she looked towards my child. She literally gathered an entourage of ""friends"" claiming Grandparents rights, and threatened to sue me for custody of my newborn because I refused to let her near my baby girl and claimed I would put multiple bullets in her skull if she ever came near my child.

When I sleep though, I can lucid dream pretty regularly and effectively, but continue to encounter the same Thought Form Guardian when I try to pass the lower astral. I struggle to control my consciousness effectively in an astral state, and continue to hit the same rejection when I try to confront it. I also struggle to Astral Project while awake, I only seem to be able to leave my body from a sleep state. 

Has anyone dealt with something similar or the same thing and can give me advice? I often deal with lots of confusion when it comes to handling my consciousness, I am working to get myself sober from marijuana as I feel that may help quite a bit. But for now, I often feel like my hemi-sync sessions are very limited, and I would like to expand my knowledge and awareness. I have tried things like studying Enochian and Metatron Light Language and doing esoteric rituals along with the meditations, and I feel this has helped some. But I am very new to all that.

Another issue I often encounter is that I do best with an in person mentor, however that doesn‚Äôt fit my financial capability at the moment and even if I could afford that, I struggle to find people who can really show me the things I want to know. I am from California originally but am currently living in Chiang Mai, Thailand.

I just got my degree. The convocation gown, the photos, the certificate ‚Äì all of it should have felt like closure. But the thing is, you don‚Äôt really ""graduate"" from an IIM. You survive it. You process it in fragments. You carry parts of it with you, for better or worse.

And maybe that‚Äôs what this post is ‚Äì my way of processing the last two years at IIM BLACKI.


The Arrival

I didn‚Äôt come from an IIT or a top-tier college. I came in wide-eyed, from a basic Tier-3 engineering background, with nothing but hope and hustle. Some came from corporate jobs, some straight from SRCC and Stephen‚Äôs, some with 2 years of UPSC prep behind them. The diversity hits you fast, and so does the hierarchy.

You think it won‚Äôt matter. That your story is unique. But it does. Your undergrad, your work-ex, your PORs, your undergrad CGPA, even your grooming ‚Äì everything is currency. And your worth on campus is constantly recalculated based on it.


The Hustle Begins

Term 1? Chaos. CV reviews start before you've figured out where the mess is. You beg seniors to look at your CV ‚Äì some do, some don‚Äôt. Some choose people who ""look the part."" Others become your lifelines. You meet all kinds.

You walk around in the same formal shirt for three days straight, editing your resume down to a single line, obsessing over font size and bullet structure. You wonder how this is what you left your job (or city or home) for.

Then comes the Summer Placement Week. You think it‚Äôs a game of strategy. It's actually a game of chance disguised as one. You hear ""Day 0,"" ""Day minus 1,"" and you scramble to get shortlisted, only to realize that your fancy work ex doesn't matter half as much as someone else's undergrad tag.

Finance? Forget it unless you‚Äôre CFA+SRCC/St. Stephen‚Äôs+Excel wizard. You pivot to consulting. Everyone does. Not because they love it, but because it‚Äôs Day 0. And everyone wants to survive Day 0.

The Great Unlearning

By the end of Term 2, you‚Äôve forgotten who you were before BLACKI. You don‚Äôt romanticize the campus anymore. You don‚Äôt post about ‚Äúgrateful to be here‚Äù unless you just got a shortlist.

You realize that placement committees, CV points, and professor perceptions carry more weight than you ever imagined. And even if you‚Äôre good ‚Äì smart, driven, well-spoken ‚Äì it might not be enough. This place doesn‚Äôt just humble you. It rewires you.

People you thought were brilliant don‚Äôt get placed. People you didn‚Äôt expect to shine ‚Äì do. Some firms show up, some vanish. Some people get PPIed, others get ghosted. You watch it all unfold like a simulation with a dicey algorithm.

And that‚Äôs when anxiety kicks in.
Not the kind that you can write off with a few deep breaths. The kind that makes you wonder if your loan was worth it. If leaving your job was worth it. If you‚Äôre worth it.


The Mid-MBA Crisis

Third term? The intern wait begins. You like the company, you want the PPO. You don‚Äôt like the company, you still fear getting a PPO and being forced to accept it. You hate the job? Too bad, you might have to take it. You love the job? Good luck getting that offer.

And then comes the exchange dilemma. You need to choose to opt for it in this term. Another 7-8 lakhs. More debt. More guilt. You're from a middle-class family that has never spent ‚Çπ100 on themselves without thinking. Now you‚Äôre planning three months in Europe? With people you barely know, hoping the trip isn‚Äôt just an expensive photoshoot?




You‚Äôll feel like a product on an assembly line. Companies negotiate. Profiles shrink. Expectations lower. And yet, you play along.

You see friends cry in their rooms after getting rejected. You see brilliant folks not getting placed till the very last day. You cheer for them when they finally do ‚Äì or stay silent because you got placed earlier and don‚Äôt know how to be happy without guilt.

This is when your real friends emerge. The ones who didn‚Äôt just drink coffee with you in Term 1 but sat with you in silence during summers.


What They Don‚Äôt Tell You

Your GPA matters way more than you think.
The brand on your undergrad still follows you.
Some seniors will ignore you; some will become family.
No one‚Äôs journey here is the same. But the pressure? That‚Äôs equal-opportunity.
And you never really get used to it ‚Äì you just learn how to carry it better.


TL;DR

Prestige doesn‚Äôt guarantee respect. You fight for it every day.

Summers, PPOs, finals‚Äînothing is predictable, except that it‚Äôll be hard.

The best part of this journey? The resilience you build. And the people who help you build it.


If this resonates, I‚Äôll write Part 2. But for now ‚Äì this was the first year condensed into a few thousand words.

1jonz0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/EyeFloaters/comments/1jonz0i/coping_mechanisms_for_students/,Coping Mechanisms for Students,"From my experience as a college student, because I see a few other people who are equally as young as me in this subreddit. Even if it is just one or two other people, I don't care. I just want to share that it is possible to study and get good grades while having eye floaters.

It really sucks having this condition this young, especially because of how busy being a student. Every day is a new battle. Sometimes I can ignore my floaters  fine (although they are very in the centre of my vision, I can assure you) and sometimes it's hard to breathe.  

My coping mechanisms include :

1. Sunglasses with astigmatism/myopia prescription or contacts (not seeing things in SHARP detail is far more annoying when you have floaters)

2. Talking and joking with friends while walking outdoors, social interaction. When I don't have company I put on some music

3. Not focusing on the LCD screen. It's too white and triggering. I focus on the teacher's voice and their chalk writings on the blackboard

4. Don't 'challenge' yourself by studying in bright lights. Find the perfect spot in the library where it's not too bright and disturbing to study, close the blinds, or study in the evenings.

Do not turn on the overhead study lamp, use lighting only from the ceiling one. 

Use something shiny/attention-grabbing to use as pointer when you read your textbook.

Doodle your textbook with pencil to really help you focus. 

READ YOUR TEXTBOOK DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF YOU / EYE-LEVEL POSITION (very helpful). If you put the book on the table and hunch over the book, the glare of the light above will bounce off the white surface of the book's paper.

5. Living one day at a time (this is very important, anxiety is usually fear of the future).

6. Focusing on OTHER PROBLEMS. Self-care, school homework, chores
Some examples :
-is my plant watered yet?
-the back of my hand is dry, I ought to wear a lotion
-I have to check the answers to my math homework before I turn it in
-What am I cooking today?

7. Never drink coffee. You are already very sensitive to stress by having eye floaters. Instead drink hot jasmine tea. Something warm and fragrant and calming. 

9. If you're sleepy/hard to focus, power nap first.

10. If you're feeling ""demotivated"" because of floaters, study anyway.

11. If you're stressed, take a breath. Do not get burnt out. 

12. Don't browse too much about your eye conditions. The internet can be a hell-hole. 

13. If it's hard to focus during lectures (bright lights in the classroom), STUDY AHEAD. 

14. Learn to say ""f*ck it"" to the voices in your head (very important).

1jonyx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1jonyx1/bloating_cravings_sluggish_energy_i_didnt_expect/,"Bloating, Cravings, Sluggish Energy... I Didn‚Äôt Expect This Supplement to Actually Help","Hey folks‚Äîjust wanted to share my real-world experience with something I wasn‚Äôt expecting to make much of a difference: **Akka Superbiotics**. I‚Äôve had mild digestive issues for years‚Äî**bloating, afternoon fatigue**, and annoying sugar cravings that always hit around 3 PM. Nothing super serious, but enough to mess with my energy and comfort daily.

I‚Äôve tried various probiotics, teas, food elimination‚Äîyou name it. Some helped a little, most didn‚Äôt. But this one? It caught me off guard, in a good way.

**What Even Is Akka Superbiotics?**

So, Akka isn‚Äôt your typical grocery store probiotic. It‚Äôs a **gut + liver support supplement** built around a lesser-known probiotic strain called **Akkermansia**. I hadn‚Äôt heard of it until recently, but apparently, it‚Äôs a big deal in the gut health world. It helps strengthen the gut lining, reduce inflammation, and support metabolic function.

Akka also includes **Quercetin, Resveratrol, and Silymarin**‚Äîwhich are known for supporting liver detox, reducing inflammation, and helping your body process fats and sugars more efficiently.

That liver connection really got my attention. I never thought much about how the liver impacts bloating or digestion, but it turns out a sluggish liver can cause or worsen both. That‚Äôs when I figured, ‚ÄúAlright, this might be worth a shot.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs the breakdown I looked at before trying it:  
[**Check out the full details here**](https://dailywellnesscare.com/pages/dwc-akk-tsl?_ef_transaction_id=&oid=22&uid=33&oid=22&affid=80&source_id=&guaffid=8928&guoid=1041&uid=2376&guoid=1041&guaffid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

**What Happened When I Actually Took It**

I started taking **one capsule of Akka Superbiotics daily** in the morning with water. That‚Äôs it.

**Week 1:**  
No major changes. Maybe slightly more regular digestion, but I wasn‚Äôt sure yet.

**Week 2:**  
This is when it started to get interesting. I noticed I wasn‚Äôt bloating like I usually do after lunch, especially after things like rice or bread. I still ate the same stuff, but my stomach didn‚Äôt puff up. Also, I had more energy through the day‚Äîless sluggish in the afternoon.

**Week 3+:**  
I felt lighter, less foggy, and I wasn‚Äôt crashing or needing extra coffee. One weird surprise: I wasn‚Äôt craving sweets nearly as much. I‚Äôm usually a ‚Äúcookies at night‚Äù kinda person, but that impulse was way down. I wasn‚Äôt trying to cut sugar‚ÄîI just didn‚Äôt want it as badly.

Here‚Äôs another link I bookmarked if you want to dig into how Akka actually works:  
[**Read more about Akka here**](https://dailywellnesscare.com/pages/dwc-akk-vsl?_ef_transaction_id=&oid=22&oid=22&affid=80&source_id=&guaffid=8928&guoid=1041&guoid=1041&guaffid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

**My Personal Pros and Cons**

**What I liked:**

* **Way less bloating**, even after heavier meals
* Afternoon energy stayed more level
* Cravings (especially sweets) went way down
* Didn‚Äôt feel like a ‚Äúsupplement‚Äù‚Äîfelt natural, no side effects

**What I didn‚Äôt like as much:**

* It‚Äôs pricier than most probiotics
* Doesn‚Äôt work overnight‚Äîyou need to give it time
* If your diet is terrible, I doubt it‚Äôll be a miracle fix

**Who I Think Akka Superbiotics Is For**

If you‚Äôve tried generic probiotics with zero results, this might be a better fit‚Äîespecially if your issues go beyond just digestion. It‚Äôs more of a **gut-metabolism-liver combo**, and for me, that combo worked better than anything I‚Äôve tried before.

Might be worth considering if you deal with:

* Bloating or heavy stomach after meals
* Fatigue or energy dips during the day
* Cravings that seem hard to control
* Just feeling ‚Äúoff‚Äù digestively, even on healthy foods

**Bottom Line**

**Akka Superbiotics didn‚Äôt change my life in a week**, but it‚Äôs made enough of a difference that I plan to keep using it. It helped me feel more like myself‚Äîlighter, clearer, and less reliant on caffeine or snacks just to function.

It‚Äôs not cheap, and it‚Äôs not magic, but if you're at the point where you feel like your gut's holding you back, this might be something to try. Definitely curious if anyone else here has tested it too‚Äîdrop your thoughts if so!",1,1743484530.0,HealthProductsNatural,0,1.0,False
1jony27,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1jony27/she_broke_up_with_me_while_i_was_driving_her_to/,"She broke up with me while I was driving her to the airport, then three weeks later texts me to get together for a ""check in"". I said no. Did I make the right call?","Hey everybody,

I'm writing this partially for myself but also for some advice. Backstory: So my ex (29) and me (30) broke up mid February. We had been together for about a year and half and lived together for the last 10 months. She had come home from a solo trip and after a few days back toldme that she thinks we are over. I responded pretty calmly, and admitted that I knew we had some things to work on, some toxic tendencies that I didn't like, and some baggage, but that I disagreed that it was bad enough to end it. We had already been going to some couple's counseling for a few months and some new, healthier habits had started to form that made me feel we were on a better trajectory with the relationship. So after that initial threat of a break up from her, we lived in limbo for about six days, where we weren't quite broken up, but not exactly together, either. We had two couples counseling sessions that went pretty well in that time and some very real chats about our relationship that seemed to help. We continued to live together, cook meals together, walk our dogs, go on dates, hang with friends, have some cuddles and kisses and such, but no sex...that was a line for her in this uncertain time. Understable. Six days into this limbo we were living in and right before she left for another solo trip, she actually broke up with me, for real this time....while I was driving her to the airport. 

I know I shouldn't have felt blindsided by that, but I did/do. I really thought that the original threat of a break up from a few days prior was just a wake up call for us to try to work things out, in earnest (which at least I was) but instead it was just a preview of what was to come. I think for her, those last days were just actually closure and a farewell to our time together. I caught her looking at old photos of us together in happier times, and it really felt like she was grieving us, right in front of me. :/

So I drove her to the airport after she broke it off, for real, and I was not as calm this time. I wasn't an outright asshole, but I was shocked and upset. As a sidenote: for a guy with some abandonment issues, getting broken up with and then seeing the person literally get on a plane and fly away was pretty upsetting. She got on her plane and left.

Well while she was gone, I packed up my own and my dog's stuff from what was once our apartment. I found housing shortly there after and she came home from her trip to me completely moved out, with my keys left for her.  We've had virtually no contact, except for me to tell her I had moved out and that I didn't want to be coming in and out of the apartment or her life to get my stuff. Then, three weeks after the real breakup, she texts me on a Friday night about getting together to ""check in"" after a ""stark separation"". I texted her back on Sunday that I wasn't keen to talk now or soon, but maybe in the future. 

I guess I'm confused how to feel. On the one hand, I'm mad that she called it ""a stark separation"", like yeah bro, you literally broke up with me and then got on a plane. What did you expect? That I'll just sit around and wait for you to come home from your trip, so we can talk more about how you think your life will be better without me in it and you can watch me move out? On the other hand, I do realize that me going no contact immediately, moving out, and removing her and her friends from my social media is ""stark"" and could be perceived as cold. But I did it as a way to protect myself and to respect her decision to have me out of her life. I don't know if I'm being strong (and more importantly, healthy) in the no contact thing by cutting her off, or if I'm letting my pain function as too punitive towards her by cutting her off and rejecting her offer to get together for a check in. I do still care about her and don't want to hurt her, even if she hurt me.

Should I see her for a coffee or something and risk being more hurt/not getting any sort of closure? Or should I continue doing me and try to keep her in the past? I guess the other possibility is that this ""check in"" is that she wants to attempt to see if we could get back together, but I kind of doubt it. With hindsight, it seems like she was checked out for the last weeks, if not months, of our relationship, withdrawing her love and investment quite a bit. I'm not really sure I want to get back together with her, even if it was on the table. I know it sounds kind of like ""I'm not fired, I quit"" but honestly her breaking it off kind of gave me the ick...like shit you don't want to put the inherent work that a relationship needs to function well as a couple with me? Ok, you're right we're not a match. bye lol

So yeah, any advice or questions you have, please drop it below. Thanks! 

TL;DR My ex (29f) wants to meet me (30m) three weeks after a breakup and basically no contact since, (instigated by me) to ""check in"" after a ""stark separation""; her words. Idk if I want to open that door to see her because I'm not sure what the purpose of a check in is in our situation. She ended it, I can't control that, and now we're going about our lives separately. It seems it would likely do more harm than good to me at this particular point. While it might offer her some closure and peace, that's not something I care to sacrifice my own for. Thoughts?

It's connected to my mall world tangentially (by a bridge) and kind of mirrors my hometown, but not really.

Anyway, it's a coastal town, like up in the Pacific Northwest. There is a hill that takes you down into it, and then on the left side there's a bunch of buildings, like a seaside town? I'll see if I can generate some images. These are shops, but then also little apartments above, and they look out over a marina. On the right side, there is a sidewalk that goes down some stairs and then you're in a sunken coffee shop. I haven't spent too much time in there, but it has yellow walls, and is really crammed -- always busy and lots of plants. Right next door is a bookstore. This is where I spend most of my time.

The bookstore has about three levels. Each level looks different -- the bookshelves are different styles, and there are different things inside. The bottom floor looks like a traditional Barnes and Noble, and it DOES connect somehow to mall world, even though that doesn't make sense logistically, and I've never been able to actually go through. Only seen it from inside of the mall at other times. The second floor has ornate, dark wooden shelving with fancy scrollwork, and the shelves are full of books and knickknacks. The third floor has bookshelves made of light wood plank, and it has books, magazines, and records. There are seating areas as well, and there's always an old bearded guy looking at records. The thing that sticks out the most is the walkways -- there are these long walkways on the second and third floor with green carpeting and wooden banisters. And you can look down at the other floors on either side. the third floor also has a dollar wall, which goes floor to ceiling and has sale books and specifically Highlights magazine. There is an entrance to the bookstore on this floor that faces this wall directly, though I don't know how, logistically. I also don't know how this connects to the coffee shop or other places around.

There's a lot more to this world -- houses I've been inside many times, and like an old monastery not that far away, but this is the place I go back to the most consistently, and have tangible experiences there.

My life (and adulthood, in general) feels overwhelmingly uncertain right now. I graduated last spring from a relatively prestigious university with degrees in Anthropology, Geography, and Sustainability. I worked my ass off while I was there. Several internships, several research labs, publications and conference presentations, working as many as 3 jobs at a time, traveling the country for research, etc. I did everything I could to build my future self a successful career in academia and archaeological science. I landed a spot in fully funded graduate program and felt like my life was really coming together!

Then I was suddenly struck with a disabling condition. Tldr: My stomach is essentially paralyzed and I suffer from intense fatigue, nausea, and chronic pain on the daily now. I can't do fieldwork anymore. I can't work in remote locations (where my research sites were) away from medical care. I had to drop out of grad school and move back home to receive treatment. 

Now I'm 23, unemployed for 8 months, and living with my parents. I'm finally well enough to work a less active job, but it feels like there's no end in sight to this slump I'm in. Most sedentary (non-fieldwork) jobs in my fields have been obliterated by the current administration. I've also had no luck with jobs unrelated to my degree. Logically I know that the nearly year long gap on my resume isn't due to a personal failure, but it feels so damning. I was well on the way to actually pursuing what I spent years of my life working towards, and now all I can land is an interview at a coffee shop. Which I'm not too upset at--I actually really enjoyed being a barista in college. It's just knowing that I can't land anything else that's eating at me. I suspect returning to graduate school or a career change is my only way out.

I've been considering library and information science, or completely pivoting into medical laboratory science or mortuary school. But it's hard to predict what will be secure when nothing has been predictable as of late. 

I suppose I just want to know if things will get better. I'm sure they can, but I'm feeling frighteningly lost right now. Every day is painfully repetitive and I can only knit so many socks or write so many substack articles before I lose my mind. Getting back up and building a new life after being knocked on my ass by the universe sucks pretty hard, to say the least. ",1,1743483264.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

This may surprise many, but Finns consume more coffee per capita than any other nation.**

Why do Finns love coffee so much? Coffee has a long history in Finland, dating back to the 18th century. Over time, it became a central part of Finnish culture. People drink coffee at home, at work, and during social gatherings.

The cold climate also plays a role, as a warm cup of coffee is comforting. Coffee breaks, known as ‚Äúkahvitauko,‚Äù are a cherished tradition in Finnish workplaces. Understanding Finland‚Äôs coffee culture offers a glimpse into the daily lives and habits of its people. It‚Äôs fascinating to see how one beverage can be so deeply woven into a nation‚Äôs fabric.

# Global Coffee Consumption

Coffee is more than just a beverage. It‚Äôs a ritual, a culture, and a global phenomenon. The question of which country drinks the most coffee often sparks interest and curiosity. Understanding global coffee consumption patterns can shed light on this fascinating topic.

# Trends In Coffee Drinking

Global coffee consumption has seen a steady rise over the past decades. Different countries have unique trends that reflect their cultural preferences and lifestyles. Here are some key trends:

* **Europe:**¬†European countries are among the top consumers of coffee. Finland leads the pack with an average consumption of 12 kg per person per year. Norway and Iceland follow closely.
* **North America:**¬†The United States is known for its love of coffee. Specialty coffee shops and instant coffee are both popular. On average, Americans consume about 4.2 kg per person per year.
* **Asia:**¬†Coffee culture is growing in countries like Japan and South Korea. While tea remains popular, coffee shops are becoming a social hub.

The table below shows the average coffee consumption per person in some key countries:

|Country|Average Consumption (kg per person/year)|
|:-|:-|
|Finland|12.0|
|Norway|9.9|
|Iceland|9.0|
|United States|4.2|
|Japan|3.3|

**Specialty coffee:**¬†The rise of specialty coffee has changed the coffee landscape. More people are seeking high-quality, ethically sourced coffee.

**Convenience:**¬†Instant coffee and single-serve pods are popular for their convenience. Busy lifestyles drive this trend.

# Cultural Significance

Coffee holds deep cultural significance in many countries. It‚Äôs not just about the drink; it‚Äôs about the experience and the rituals associated with it.

* **Finland:**¬†Coffee is a social activity. Finns enjoy coffee breaks known as ‚Äúkahvitauko‚Äù several times a day. It‚Äôs common to offer guests coffee when they visit.
* **Italy:**¬†Espresso is a symbol of Italian culture. Italians typically enjoy their coffee standing at a bar. It‚Äôs quick, strong, and part of daily life.
* **Turkey:**¬†Turkish coffee is a traditional drink with a rich history. It‚Äôs often served during social gatherings and special occasions. The preparation and serving process is an art form.

In the United States, coffee has become a symbol of productivity. The ‚Äúcoffee break‚Äù is an essential part of the workday. Coffee shops serve as places for socializing, working, and relaxing.

In Japan, coffee culture blends traditional and modern elements. Cafes range from quiet, serene spaces to bustling, trendy spots. Coffee is often enjoyed with sweets, reflecting a blend of Western and Japanese traditions.

These cultural nuances highlight the diverse ways in which coffee is enjoyed around the world. Understanding these customs adds to the appreciation of coffee‚Äôs global impact.

# Top Coffee Consuming Countries

Many people around the world love coffee, but some countries have a special connection with this beloved drink. Exploring the top coffee consuming countries reveals fascinating cultural habits and traditions. Let‚Äôs dive into the coffee culture of these leading nations.

# Finland‚Äôs Coffee Culture

Finland leads the world in coffee consumption. The average Finn drinks about 12 kg of coffee per year. This strong coffee culture is deeply rooted in their daily life.

In Finland, coffee breaks are an important part of the workday. These breaks are called ‚Äúkahvitauko‚Äù and usually occur twice a day. Coffee is often enjoyed with a sweet pastry or a sandwich.

* **Kahvi:**¬†Finnish word for coffee.
* **Pullakahvit:**¬†Coffee with a sweet bun.

During social gatherings, coffee is a must. Whether it‚Äôs a family event or a casual meeting with friends, a cup of coffee brings people together.

|Event|Typical Coffee Served|
|:-|:-|
|Work Meetings|Black Coffee|
|Family Gatherings|Coffee with Milk|
|Festivities|Special Brewed Coffee|

Finland‚Äôs coffee culture isn‚Äôt just about quantity; it‚Äôs about quality and connection. The Finns take their coffee seriously, ensuring every cup is rich and flavorful.

# Norway‚Äôs Daily Ritual

Norway also ranks high in coffee consumption. Norwegians drink nearly 10 kg of coffee per person annually. Coffee is a daily ritual for many Norwegians.

In Norway, coffee is consumed throughout the day. The first cup often begins with breakfast. The tradition continues with several more cups during the day. Norwegians prefer their coffee black and strong.

There are several common practices in Norway‚Äôs coffee culture:

1. **Morning Coffee:**¬†A strong brew to start the day.
2. **Work Breaks:**¬†Coffee is enjoyed during short work breaks.
3. **Evening Coffee:**¬†Often served with dessert.

Socializing over coffee is also very common. Friends and family gather in homes or cafes, sharing stories over a cup of coffee. This practice is known as ‚Äúkaffekos,‚Äù which means enjoying coffee in a cozy atmosphere.

Norwegians value the experience of drinking coffee. It‚Äôs not just about the caffeine but the ritual and the connections made over each cup. From early morning to late evening, coffee is a beloved part of Norwegian life.

# Coffee Consumption Per Capita

Coffee is more than just a beverage; it‚Äôs a part of culture in many countries. When we talk about which country drinks the most coffee, we often look at coffee consumption per capita. This metric helps us understand how much coffee each person in a country consumes on average. By examining this data, we can identify the world‚Äôs biggest coffee drinkers and understand their coffee culture better.

# Measuring Per Capita Consumption

Per capita coffee consumption is a useful way to measure how much coffee people drink in a specific country. This measurement takes the total amount of coffee consumed and divides it by the population. This gives an average amount of coffee each person drinks in a year.

To measure per capita coffee consumption, data from various sources are used, such as:

* National coffee associations
* Surveys and studies
* Import and export data

The results can be surprising. For instance, some of the top coffee-consuming countries per capita are not the largest countries in terms of population. Here are some of the top countries by coffee consumption per capita:

|Country|Annual Coffee Consumption (kg per person)|
|:-|:-|
|Finland|12|
|Norway|9.9|
|Iceland|9|

These numbers show that people in these countries drink a lot of coffee every year. This high consumption can be linked to their cultures and daily routines.

# Factors Influencing Consumption

Several factors influence coffee consumption per capita. One major factor is cultural habits. In some countries, coffee drinking is a part of daily life. For example, in Finland, coffee breaks known as ‚Äúkahvitauko‚Äù are common in workplaces.

Climate also plays a role. In colder countries, people might drink more coffee to stay warm. This could be one reason why Nordic countries have high coffee consumption rates.

Economic factors are also important. In wealthier countries, people can afford to buy more coffee. They might also have access to better coffee-making equipment.

I thought I would update you all on the ""I showed osu! to a girl at work"" situation. Surprisingly, after the whole embarrassment of the last post, I owned up and showed her the post because I felt bad for broadcasting her words without her consent. She had a laugh and said it was fine, she just found it funny that I even posted it.

Skip ahead a few months and we talked more regularly, making osu! related in-jokes quite a lot, and she occasionally checked the osugame subreddit when I sent her a specific post, so she somewhat knows what goes on in the osu! community.

Anyway, last week, I joked that I was single and she sort of seemed surprised but tried to joke it off. She didn't text me all weekend and I thought something was upsetting her, so yesterday (Monday) I asked her to go have a coffee break together but she declined. But, today, she asked ME to go get coffee.





As she was frothing the milk she said ""didn't you say you were single last week""

so I responded ""ahaha yeah, why?""

then she said ""does that mean you can be my very own circle clicker hahaha""

I said ""ahaha wait what do you mean?""

And she finally said ""like go out go out""

I smiled SO hard my cheeks are literally still in pain as I post this, and I wasn't really thinking so I tried saying something funny and I said: ""you must be the deceit because you're going crazy fast"" (I showed her the ivaxa pp record when it got posted) 

And she said really calmly ""well I hope you can keep up ivaxa!""



So yeah I have to talk to her more after work to clarify and like make sure I'm not misinterpreting but I THINK this is real guys I think we might actually be going out LOL",25,1743482507.0,osugame,10,0.84,False

I could say so much about this girl lol the classic type of manipulating and insecure, constantly makes you think you're one step off being her perfect match but in reality you're just a placeholder until something better comes along. I had grown increasingly disinterested in it but was afraid of having her blow up if I suddenly cut it off, and then the universe just simply took care of it for me which you'll see in this exchange. 

Context: 

I had been texting her on and off for a couple years which had gotten more frequent over the last few months and she kept playing bait and switch with visiting each other (I am in Manhattan, she is in vet school in another state 1000+ miles away). When we were together in the past it was my first real relationship (or so I thought) and she broke up with me literally every other week or so and made me come crawling back. It is so funny because I think she could tell my responses had been getting increasingly disinterested the last few days (I had COVID, was working 70 hours a week, and had no interest in her emotional volatility). I was keeping the responses short and non-emotional and she was getting more and more impatient. She had thrown me off my game so much in the past and I think I had only been engaging with her texts since our prior relationship had felt like ""unfinished business"" (which I'm pretty sure she did on purpose). I am so happy to say I am completely 100% moved on from her and this last interaction was the icing on the cake. As additional closure, the one positive that came out of these recent texting sessions with her is that she accidentally revealed that she had fucked an IDF soldier while on a trip to Israel (while we were together and had sex after the fact) so she can add cheating on me to her roladex. Anyway, I have a date with my female best friend of 5 years coming up later this week, we each confessed our feelings for each other recently, and I could not be more excited to pursue love with someone who cares about me for non-selfish/insecure reasons.

My job experience is mostly customer service, mostly food service, with some hospitality. During college I was in event management organizations and that was fun, but I haven‚Äôt been able to land any job except really tough (physically) work that pays little. (Ex: kitchen jobs, waitering, senior caretaking, warehouse truck unloading‚Ä¶) My most physically easier jobs was grocery stores and cashiering for them, coffee barista, and music teacher. I‚Äôve also worked front desk night auditing at hotels, but I was traumatized from the yelling, verbal abuse from guests, and 6hr shifts that became ‚Äúcan you stay longer 12hr shifts and made you stand for hours in business shoes (actually broke my foot and limped after I quit for a year and a half).

I also gave a bachelor‚Äôs in linguistics but I found it‚Äôs a very useless degree‚Ä¶ and originally I used to be a near professional classical musician‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs also not very useful atm. 

This year I moved out of small town Indiana and moved to Chicago , only to find out that service industry jobs here shut down stores quickly, lay you off by withdrawing hours from you if they don‚Äôt see you work good enough, also might have higher standards for working than what I know. 

I landed my first corporate job for a call center but got T-boned in a car accident and couldn‚Äôt commute 3hours by train anymore so I quit. The people there seemed alarmed when I was too friendly or talked to bond with them and I also realized corporate culture sadly might be alienating for me.

In short, I‚Äôm physically and mentally exhausted of these entry level jobs and want to work something more higher paying. But I don‚Äôt have enough social battery for sales in general, I don‚Äôt do well with rejection so door-to-door sales was really hard and depressing, but I get too lonely and unmotivated in superficial work relationships.

We are a silly, social, active, and intentional community of considerate humans looking for a new roommate to compliment our ‚Äúco-op lite‚Äù community in Millbrae, CA. We value silliness, connection, and authentically communicating. We love sharing meals, hosting, and supporting each other while also allowing for personal recharge space. We are excited to meet you and discuss how the house can adjust to fit your hopes and dreams and become a shared living space that works well for all of us! :)

THE HOUSE

Our home is a beautiful house nestled next to downtown Millbrae, a 7 minute bike ride to Bart and Caltrain and a 2 minute walk to Trader Joe‚Äôs/Safeway/Dean‚Äôs Produce. We have 5 bedrooms in total, 3 bathrooms, a living room, dining room, kitchen, workout area, ceramics studio, woodshop, garage with storage space, hardwood floors, and in-unit washer and dryer. More details about the house can be found below.

COST OF LIVING

Rent for the available room is $1925 (for a single) or ~$2800 (for a double/couple) for the master bedroom with its own private bathroom. We split utilities (water, trash, internet, electricity) which averages ~$100 per person per month. As part of our intentional living community we strive for two house dinners a week. We tend to also share costs such as bulk groceries and house supplies - house dinners and bulk supplies averages around ~$100 per person per month. If expenses are prohibitive for you, we encourage you to apply anyway - we are open to figuring something out.

AVAILABLE ROOM

Bedroom (233 sq ft)
[Roommate blurb] This room is spacious, beautiful, quiet, and full of light. Facing the yard at the back of the house with 6 full windows and a balcony overseeing the fire pit, there is still lots of wall real-estate for hanging art, pictures, and shelves. We would often open the balcony doors in the morning to hear the birds and let light spill in. The hardwood floors and exposed wood ceilings give a really warm cozy feeling. It's very nice to have your own bathroom with a shower, and a huge walk-in closet with built-in (configurable) shelving - tons of space for clothes and gear. I loved living here for the past year and would be staying but am excited to move in with my partner. With a queen bed, a couple dressers, and a desk there was still so much room for late night dancing or blowing up an air mattress for an overnight guest. The only shared wall with another bedroom is the shower wall so the bedroom is nicely isolated and quiet. The combination of heating or opening up the windows for some cross breeze make it a comfortable room throughout the year. I hope whoever lives here next enjoys this room as much as I did!

Hello! As the title says, looking for someone that can talk literally the whole night with. Can literally be about anything or if you need an ear to vent about something or just wanting a friend I‚Äôm here! 

A bit about me is, I teach, I gym almost everyday, and I like to cook! I love listening to Jazz music and I really enjoy a nice coffee conversation with music in the background. I listen to everything and I will take any options you‚Äôre willing to share and I‚Äôll listen! 

If you‚Äôre interested shoot me a DM! Tell me your age and a bit about yourself! Don‚Äôt worry I don‚Äôt bite! Haha, can‚Äôt wait to hear from you! ",0,1743481732.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

I‚Äôm on a mission to meet some like-minded people who live *near-ish* to me‚Äîbecause, let‚Äôs be honest, the less time spent commuting, the better. Looking for the sort of friends that are comfy just dropping by whenever they're free. I just moved near Yonge and Eglinton and will probably be living here until I die.

# Who Am I?

I‚Äôm a 35-year-old East-Asian-Canadian guy trying to build a life that actually feels fulfilling, ideally with some great people around. A few things about me:

üé® **Creative Type‚Ñ¢** ‚Äì I paint, draw, write and love world/story building.  
üé∂ **Music Lover** ‚Äì Whether I‚Äôm playing it, analyzing it, or just experiencing it, I‚Äôm always down to listen to music. Also big on checking out live shows/concerts.  
üì∏ **Photography Nerd** ‚Äì If you see someone dramatically photographing the sky, that‚Äôs probably me.  
üìñ **Deep Thinker** ‚Äì I enjoy existential conversations, philosophy, theory crafting and coming up with cool concepts for art projects/stories.  
üéÆ **Gamer** ‚Äì If you play games, there‚Äôs a solid chance we have some overlap. (PC)

I‚Äôm currently figuring out my next big move in life, and part of that means expanding my social circle with people who actually live **nearby**‚Äîbecause I‚Äôd rather spend time hanging out than commuting across the city like I‚Äôm on a daily pilgrimage. I am single as well, but not really looking anymore.

# Who I‚Äôm Looking For

Cool, creative, and chill people who like good conversation, spontaneous hangouts, picnics/park walks, and maybe even collaborating on some artsy projects. If you‚Äôre into coffee shop chats, music talk, gaming, art hangs, or just chillin, hit me up! 420 friendly and don't drink much anymore.
