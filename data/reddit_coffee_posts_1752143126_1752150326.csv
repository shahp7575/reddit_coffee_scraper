In today’s competitive business landscape, visibility is everything—especially when the sun goes down. If your store, restaurant, or service business operates in the evening or late hours, standing out from the crowd becomes even more critical. That’s where [custom LED signs](https://www.signresourcesnc.com/signs/led-signs/) come in. With their eye-catching glow, energy efficiency, and versatile design, these signs are powerful tools that not only enhance your nighttime presence but also **boost your sales**.

In this blog, we’ll explore the ways custom LED signs can transform your business after dark, attract more foot traffic, and increase overall revenue.

# 1. The Power of Visibility After Dark

Whether you’re located in a busy urban street or a quiet suburban plaza, one thing is certain—when night falls, traditional signage often fades into the background. Unlike static or dimly lit signs, **custom LED signs** are designed to **shine brightly and stay visible** no matter the time of day.

LED signs can be seen from a greater distance and are much more vibrant than standard signs. This means potential customers driving or walking by your business at night are more likely to notice your brand, logo, and message. The brighter your presence, the more eyes you attract.

# Real-world example:

Imagine two coffee shops on the same street. One has a basic sign, and the other displays a glowing, animated LED sign that says, “Hot Drinks | Open Late | Free Wi-Fi.” Which one do you think a passerby will notice and consider? The answer is obvious—and that’s the power of night-time visibility.

# 2. Attract Impulse Buyers

A well-lit sign not only improves visibility but also **encourages impulse purchases**. Customers who see an inviting, vibrant sign may feel compelled to stop by—even if they weren’t initially planning to.

LED signs allow you to display promotions, discounts, or real-time messages like “Open 24/7,” “Happy Hour Tonight,” or “Clearance Sale.” When people are out at night—whether commuting, running errands, or looking for a place to eat or shop—these dynamic messages can trigger immediate action.

# 3. Reinforce Brand Identity and Professionalism

Your signage says a lot about your business. A dull, outdated, or poorly lit sign can send the wrong message, especially at night. In contrast, **custom LED signs** project an image of **modernity, professionalism, and trustworthiness**.

You can tailor your LED sign to reflect your brand identity with custom colors, logos, fonts, and animations. This consistency not only reinforces your branding but also helps with recognition over time. When customers see your LED sign glowing night after night, it becomes a familiar symbol they associate with your products or services.

# 4. 24/7 Advertising Without Extra Cost

Unlike other forms of advertising that cost you per impression or time slot, **LED signs promote your business continuously—even while you sleep.** Once installed, they serve as round-the-clock marketing tools with minimal maintenance.

Even if your business closes at 9 or 10 PM, your LED sign can continue displaying your name, logo, and tagline, keeping your presence alive in the minds of passersby. This long-term visibility is especially valuable for businesses on high-traffic roads or busy intersections.

# 5. Energy Efficiency and Cost Savings

One of the biggest advantages of LED signage is its **energy efficiency**. Unlike traditional neon or incandescent signs, LEDs use a fraction of the power while providing even greater brightness. This makes them ideal for long operating hours, especially during nighttime.

In addition to lower electricity bills, [LED signs](https://www.signresourcesnc.com/signs/led-signs/) last significantly longer—up to 50,000 hours or more—meaning fewer replacements and reduced maintenance costs. Over time, this adds up to substantial savings while still maintaining a high-impact display.

# 6. Customizable and Dynamic Messaging

Unlike static signage that displays the same message year-round, **LED signs can be programmed to show dynamic content**. This means you can update your messaging to match seasonal promotions, time-sensitive events, or real-time updates like:

* “Now Hiring – Apply Inside”
* “Tonight Only: Buy One, Get One Free”
* “Open During Construction”
* “Live Music Tonight at 8 PM”

This flexibility allows you to engage with potential customers in more relevant and compelling ways—especially during nighttime when fewer distractions compete for their attention.

# 7. Ideal for a Wide Range of Businesses

Custom LED signs are versatile and work well across various industries. Whether you run a:

* **Restaurant or café**
* **Retail store**
* **Convenience store or gas station**
* **Hotel or motel**
* **Fitness center**
* **Medical clinic**
* **Auto service center**

Your business can benefit from the increased visibility and professional appearance of an LED sign. They’re especially impactful for businesses that operate during evening or overnight hours, such as 24/7 stores, bars, or urgent care facilities.

# 8. Standing Out in a Competitive Market

If your competitors are using LED signs and you’re not, you may be losing out on visibility and customer engagement. On the flip side, if your competitors still rely on traditional signage, switching to custom LED signage gives you a competitive edge.

The brighter and more engaging your storefront, the more likely people are to choose your business over others nearby. In crowded markets, this differentiation is key to staying ahead.

# Final Thoughts

In a world where visibility equals opportunity, **custom LED signs are a game-changer for night-time business success**. They help you get noticed, convey professionalism, attract impulse buyers, and advertise your services 24/7—all while saving energy and maintenance costs.

Whether you’re looking to refresh your storefront or increase evening foot traffic, investing in a custom LED sign is a smart, long-term strategy. Light up your brand—literally—and watch how your **night-time visibility transforms into increased sales**.

1lwbd8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lwbd8p/aita_ive_lost_respect_for_my_girlfriend_because/,AITA? I've lost respect for my girlfriend because of how she behaves with her mother.,"**Context:** 

* My gf and I have been together for 5 years now. She had a rough childhood with both of her parents, physical and verbal abuse from her father, and mental manipulation from both parents. 
* I've recently discovered I have ADHD, for which I'm currently taking medication.
* She and her mom both fled her dad and lived in a women's shelter for a year before moving to an apartment. They are very close as a result of this.
* The mom came over for an ABBA tribute and brought her dog, whom we've taken care of before, so our two cats are used to the dog, but not the mom as much. The mom scheduled with us to stay over that night in our apartment.

**Events:**

* Evening
   * My gf's mom stayed over last night after we came home from a small festival in the national park. I watched my gf spend all day setting up the mom's bedroom after we had already cleaned the entire house from top to bottom and arranged for the room to be spotless. She moved a lamp in there as a night light because they both have a fear of sleeping in the dark. The mom wanted to put an umbrella on the lamp to dim its light, which I said was a bad idea, because it's a fire hazard. The mom did it anyway, and I complained, but my gf told me to leave it be, which is massively irresponsible to me. The mom then decided against it, thankfully, and wanted us to leave both bathroom lights on as they shine light into the bedroom she was using, and acted as a nightlight. I was frustrated by that point because it's such a fuss to make in someone else's house, but I was happy for it to be the case rather than set ablaze our apartment. We went to bed, and her mom, who brought her dog, went for a walk, came back, and went to sleep.
* Morning
   * After we woke up, we ordered a coffee delivery. Upon approaching our front door to collect it, I noticed the door was open. Her mother had left the door open all night after coming back from the walk, and our cat was sitting one flight of stairs up in the hallway. We got him back inside and realised the dog had drunk all of the cat's water, eaten their food, and to top it off, I realised our cat may have been outside all night without food or water since he was thirsty, and hungry when he came in (we live in 30 degree celcius heat btw). My gf seemed unhappy, but didn't scold her mom at all, and also laughed about the situation. She is the primary caretaker of these cats, and I play with them, feed them, and entertain them. I've grown fond of the cat that escaped, as we got him together. 

**My Reaction:**

* As of 2 months ago, there has been a guy on the news for going around and skinning cats in the area, who is still at large with a reward of 5,000 EUR. I feel that he way my gf can bend over backwards for her mom, and allow almost any situation to pass, even if it is truly dangerous for a member of our family, gives me no hope that she will stand up to her mom under any circumstances.
* I don't blame her mom for the mistake of leaving the door open, but as a person she is entirely rude and completely disrespecful. I imagine if we did the same to her we'd never hear the end of it had her dog ran off around the apartment complex. I have no idea who might be a weirdo living in the block, so it upsets me greatly.

My Question:

* Am I overreacting because of my ADHD medication, or is this rational anger? My blood was boiling when thinking about how scared the cat would have been if the door had closed over him last night, and he was just in the hallway alone for hours.

He is giving an exercise class on taxation i am currently attending. Next week is the last lecture where we can ask questions.

I like big, burly guys and he definitely fits this description! I haven’t had the chance to talk one on one with him, but he seems to be very charismatic. I also attended a program where there were presentations from one of the big four and one of my professors and him presented the new master program. Afterwards we had dinner and could talk to the auditors and he sat near me, so we could listen into each other’s conversations and also had conversations in the group. I was also able to talk about my Erasmus stay next semester. 

I wanted to go after my class and say something like: “ hey, i don’t want to miss out on asking u on a coffee date! I think your are very attractive and seem very nice. I dont know what ur situation is like. But i wanted to ask.”

I will ask in German so its going to be a lot more polished 😅!

The idea of becoming “a trader” sounds cool until you actually open a chart. Suddenly, you’re staring at red and green sticks, random acronyms, and numbers that change faster than your attention span can keep up. You’re trying to learn candlesticks while mentally calculating how many more shifts you need to work to afford losing a trade.

Welcome to trading in 2025-where AI bots are flipping positions in milliseconds, meme coins can make or break a portfolio, and everyone on Reddit swears they doubled their money last week.

But here’s what they don’t say: **most people quit**. Not because they aren’t smart, but because they try to skip the foundation. They chase the hype, ignore the risk, and forget that every skill-especially one that builds wealth-has a learning curve.

This guide isn’t about overnight success. It’s about building a real, repeatable skill set that gives you leverage in a world where money moves faster than attention. If you’ve got the drive, the patience, and a little bit of rage toward your current bank balance, you’re already halfway there.

Let’s build your foundation.

# Build Your Trading Foundation Step-by-Step

**What are the key trading terms and concepts in 2025?**

Learning to trade in 2025 is like learning a new language-except this one can make (or lose) you real money. Most people try to jump in with strategies before they understand the words. That’s like trying to win at poker when you don’t know what a flush is.

This year, understanding terms like “liquidity” and “spread” isn’t optional-it’s the bare minimum. When a market’s liquidity is low, you can get stuck in a trade with no way out. If you don’t know how leverage works, you’ll end up using borrowed money like it’s a bonus instead of what it is: a debt with a fuse attached.

And then there’s volatility. In today’s markets, volatility isn’t just a thing-it’s the whole game. You have to know how price movements work and why they happen, or every candle will feel like chaos.

Most new traders underestimate just how much these basics affect everything. They treat terms like “stop-loss” or “position sizing” as fine print. But in 2025, these aren’t definitions-they’re survival tools. Understanding them doesn’t just make you a better trader. It keeps you in the game long enough to actually get good.

**How do different markets work? (stocks, forex, crypto, commodities)**

One of the first things you realize when you start trading is that not all markets are created equal. The stock market might feel familiar, thanks to Robinhood and TikTok finance influencers. But even there, the landscape is changing. AI earnings models, central bank statements, and recession rumors move stocks with insane speed. Some days, one press release can wipe out a week of gains.

Forex is its own beast. You’re trading global currencies based on geopolitical drama, interest rate changes, and inflation data. It’s 24/5, meaning the action barely sleeps. It rewards macro thinkers and punishes impulsive ones.

Then there's crypto, which somehow exists in its own gravity field. Price swings of 20% in a day aren’t shocking-they’re normal. Crypto is where risk and reward live next door to each other. It’s also where new traders get wrecked if they mistake noise for trends.

Commodities like oil and gold move slower, but they’re influenced by global tension, supply chains, and even the weather. They’re not sexy, but they’re stable. And in a world where AI can fake a news story, sometimes slow and boring is exactly what you need.

Learning how each market behaves is non-negotiable. You don’t bring the same energy to crypto that you do to commodities. The rules, the psychology, the volatility-everything shifts. Knowing that is power.

**How automation and AI have changed market basics**

Back in the day, trading meant staring at charts all day, placing orders manually, and reacting as fast as your fingers could type. But 2025 doesn’t play like that. Now, the smartest traders aren’t just human-they’re hybrid. They use automation to monitor price levels. They set bots to enter trades on conditions they define. They analyze sentiment using AI that scrapes Twitter, Reddit, and real-time news.

This doesn’t mean you need to become a coder or build a quant strategy. But it does mean you have to understand how tech is shaping the market you’re playing in. If your trades are manual and emotional while others are automated and data-driven, guess who’s getting outplayed?

The biggest shift AI has brought isn’t speed-it’s efficiency. Machines aren’t afraid. They don’t panic sell. They execute plans. If you can combine your human insight with algorithmic precision, you’re not competing with the system. You’re working with it.

Ignoring this evolution is like showing up to a Formula 1 race on a bicycle. You might be determined, but you’re not winning.

**A Personal Start: My First Trade Was All Vibes and No Plan**

I still remember the day I made my first trade. It was a random crypto coin someone hyped in a Telegram group. I didn’t check the chart. I didn’t set a stop-loss. I just bought in because it had “moon” energy.

It tanked 40% in an hour.

That loss was my wake-up call. I realized I didn’t even know the rules of the game I was playing. So I started over-this time with a notebook, a trading journal, and a rule: no more trades without understanding the terms, the market, and the risk.

You don’t need to be perfect when you start. But you do need to be self-aware enough to admit what you don’t know. That’s when things begin to click.

**Book Insight:** ***“Trading in the Zone” by Mark Douglas - Chapter 3: Taking Responsibility***

One line from this book changed everything for me: “The best traders think in terms of probabilities, not certainties.”

That line lives in my head rent-free every time I hit buy or sell. It reminds me that the market doesn’t owe me anything. My only job is to make high-quality decisions consistently. The outcome? That’s probability.

# Choose and Build a Strategy That Works for You

*(Because Copy-Pasting Someone Else’s Plan Is a Fast Track to Burnout)*

**What are the most effective trading strategies in 2025?**

The mistake most beginners make in 2025 is thinking there’s a *best* strategy. There isn’t. There’s only the one that makes sense for your brain, your schedule, and your nervous system. If you’re trying to follow a high-frequency scalping strategy but you work a full-time job and flinch at every red candle, you’re setting yourself up to fail.

This year, the most effective strategies are the ones that balance automation with intuition. That means using tools-yes-but also trusting what you’ve learned. Trend-following has made a big comeback thanks to momentum in tech and energy stocks. Meanwhile, mean-reversion plays are back in style in commodities where prices overcorrect like clockwork.

If you’re into crypto, smart contract tracking and real-time on-chain analysis have opened new frontiers. And in forex, pairing macro themes (like interest rate cuts or central bank shifts) with swing setups is giving traders serious edge.

But again-this only works if it fits *you*. That’s the entire point.

The traders who stick around aren’t necessarily the most skilled. They’re the ones who picked a strategy they could show up for consistently, even on bad days. Especially on bad days.

**Day trading vs. swing trading: pros, cons, and lifestyle fit**

Day trading sounds sexy. You’re in and out, fast money, fast wins. But here’s the truth: day trading is a job. It requires hours of screen time, mental stamina, and the ability to take losses without spiraling. You can’t do it while also working a 9-5 or managing a full course load. You’ll either burn out-or blow up your account.

Swing trading is slower. You hold positions for days or weeks. You spend more time analyzing and less time reacting. It gives you space to live, reflect, and not obsess over every tick. And for most people in 2025-especially Gen Z working multiple gigs or managing unpredictable schedules-swing trading just fits better.

I tried both. Day trading left me fried. I’d stare at charts all morning, panic over news, and end up emotionally wiped by noon. Switching to swing gave me room to breathe. I could do my analysis at night, set alerts, and get back to living. I didn’t just trade better-I *felt* better.

The strategy isn’t just about profits. It’s about sustainability. Because what’s the point of making money if your mental health is in shambles?

**How to create a trading plan tailored to your goals and risk appetite**

Here’s the thing most “trading gurus” won’t tell you: the best traders don’t just have a strategy-they have a *plan*. One they built themselves. Not a recycled PDF. Not a screenshot of someone else’s Excel sheet.

Your trading plan should include:

* What markets you’re trading and why  
* What timeframes you're focused on  
* Your entry criteria-clear, tested, and repeatable  
* Your exit rules, both for taking profits *and* cutting losses  
* Your max risk per trade, based on your actual finances-not vibes  

But more than that, your plan should be *honest*. If you can only trade on weekends, build around that. If your budget is $200, don’t over-leverage trying to hit a $2,000 goal in a week. Set goals based on **progress**, not pressure.

When I finally wrote out a real plan-on paper, not in my head-everything shifted. I wasn’t just reacting anymore. I was operating. Even when I lost money, I didn’t spiral, because I knew it was part of the process.

You need that. You need structure, or you’ll make emotional decisions and blame the market when really, it’s the lack of clarity that hurts you.

**Book Insight:** ***“The Psychology of Money” by Morgan Housel - Chapter 7: Freedom***

There’s a line in this book that lives in the back of my mind when I’m building or tweaking my strategy: **“The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up and say, ‘I can do whatever I want today.’”**

Your trading strategy should *give* you freedom, not steal it. That’s the whole reason we chase this in the first place, right? Not to become slaves to screens-but to earn control of our time.

So build a plan that gives you that. And stick to it when the market tries to convince you otherwise.

# Learn Technical and Fundamental Analysis Together

*(Because Real Traders Don’t Guess-They Read the Game from Both Sides)*

**What technical indicators are working best in 2025?**

Let’s address the elephant in the trading Discord: most indicators are useless if you don’t understand what they’re showing you. It’s easy to slap ten lines on a chart and call it “confluence.” It’s harder to learn what price is *actually* telling you.

In 2025, the traders who are winning are the ones keeping it simple. RSI (Relative Strength Index) is still relevant, especially on higher timeframes. But it’s not just about seeing “overbought” or “oversold.” The real insight comes from context. Are we trending, ranging, or reversing? RSI hits different when you zoom out.

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) has made a comeback, especially among swing traders who want to confirm momentum before jumping in. Combined with volume profiles, it can expose fake breakouts and help avoid getting faked out by market noise.

Fibonacci retracements are no longer a meme-used well, they still work. But again, it’s about *context*. Blindly drawing lines without a plan is like trying to GPS a road trip without a destination. You’ll move a lot and go nowhere.

And this year, one of the most underrated tools? VWAP-the Volume Weighted Average Price. Especially in fast-moving markets like tech stocks and intraday crypto. It gives you a real sense of where price is fair, not just hyped.

The best traders in 2025 don’t use a million indicators. They use two or three *very well*. The goal isn’t to predict the future. It’s to stack probabilities in your favor-and know what to do when those probabilities break down.

**How to read charts and identify real patterns (updated with data)**

There’s a big difference between seeing a pattern and actually understanding it. Just because a chart looks like a “double bottom” doesn’t mean it’s a buy. 2025 is the year of pattern fatigue-everyone sees the same thing, and half of it is noise.

What’s working now is focusing less on textbook patterns and more on *structure*. Are we making higher highs and higher lows? Are key levels being respected or broken violently? Are we consolidating under resistance (which often leads to breakouts), or are we topping out after a parabolic move?

Candlestick patterns are still valuable, but not in isolation. A hammer candle means nothing if it forms in the middle of nowhere. Context is everything. Location on the chart matters. The time of day matters. The volume behind it matters.

Real chart reading isn’t about drawing lines-it’s about asking the right questions:

* Who is trapped in this move?  
* Where is liquidity sitting?  
* What does this candle mean *relative to the last ten*?  

I used to stare at charts and force patterns. I'd convince myself a triangle was forming just because I wanted it to. That’s not analysis-that’s fantasy. The shift happened when I stopped asking, “What pattern is this?” and started asking, “What is price telling me?”

That’s when I started making real trades-not hopeful guesses.

**How to analyze news, events, and macroeconomic data that move prices**

Technical analysis shows *what’s* happening. Fundamental analysis explains *why*.

In 2025, skipping macro data is like playing chess without watching your opponent. Inflation reports, unemployment numbers, central bank decisions-these don’t just move markets. They *define* the environment you’re trading in.

When the Fed hints at rate cuts, stocks run. When oil prices spike, commodity currencies shift. When AI regulation headlines hit, tech stocks either fly or collapse. You can’t trade in a vacuum. Even crypto, which once moved independently, now reacts to global events and ETF flows.

So how do you actually follow fundamentals without drowning in data?

Focus on impact, not volume. Learn which events move your chosen markets. Build a weekly habit of checking the economic calendar. Read executive summaries from trusted sources instead of doom-scrolling finance Twitter. And most importantly-**connect it back to your charts**. Use news as the “why” behind your setups.

The real edge is in knowing when fundamentals and technicals align. When a bullish chart setup gets backed by strong earnings or dovish monetary policy-that’s when conviction is real.

**Combining technical and fundamental analysis for better decisions**

This is where the magic happens. Alone, technicals are great for timing. Fundamentals give you direction. But together? They give you conviction.

Let’s say a tech stock is forming a clean breakout pattern. Looks good on the chart. But then you check earnings-they beat expectations, guidance is up, and the sector is buzzing with AI tailwinds. Now you’re not just guessing. You’re acting with alignment.

On the flip side, maybe the chart looks great-but the company is laying off employees, or their CEO just resigned. That’s a signal to either wait, reduce position size, or avoid the trade altogether.

I didn’t really level up until I started blending both. For a while, I was only technical. I ignored the news and thought charts were everything. Then I got blindsided by a CPI release that nuked my setup. That loss taught me more than any YouTube tutorial ever could.

Great trades don’t just happen when price looks right. They happen when **price, sentiment, and fundamentals line up like stars**.

**Book Insight:** ***“Unknown Market Wizards” by Jack Schwager - Chapter 5: The Blend of Art and Science***

There’s a quote from this book that stuck with me for weeks: **“The best traders are neither purely technical nor purely fundamental. They know how to see the story behind the chart-and the chart behind the story.”**

That’s the level we’re aiming for. Not just memorizing setups, but actually *understanding* what’s unfolding and why. That’s what separates the lucky wins from long-term consistency.

# Practice and Improve with the Right Tools

*(Because Reading About Trading Isn’t the Same as Doing It-And You Know It)*

**What are the best trading platforms for new learners in 2025?**

In 2025, choosing a trading platform isn’t about picking the one with the flashiest homepage or the most aggressive YouTube sponsor. It’s about finding something that fits how *you* learn, test, and execute.

There are a few standouts that consistently support new traders without drowning them in features they won’t use. Apps like TradingView have basically become the universal language of charting-clean interface, community support, and enough customization to grow with you. And then there’s platforms like Thinkorswim, which let you simulate trades with advanced tools but without real risk.

For crypto learners, newer decentralized platforms with built-in learning modules have become surprisingly good. Some of them reward you for testing your knowledge with small real-stakes trades using house capital. Others simulate entire ecosystems where you can test staking, farming, and trading side by side.

But none of this matters if you’re platform hopping every week. The best tool is the one you *actually stick with*, learn inside and out, and use to track your progress-not chase perfection.

When I first started, I tried five platforms in three months. Each time I’d think, “Maybe this one will make me better.” But what really made me better was choosing one, learning its flow, and making it my second language. Once you know your tools like muscle memory, *that’s* when real progress starts.

**How to use demo accounts to test and refine your strategies**

Demo accounts sound boring. Most new traders think they’re a waste of time. “Fake money, fake stakes, fake lessons,” right? But the truth is, if you treat your demo account like a joke, that’s exactly how your real trades will go.

The point of demo trading isn’t just practice-it’s *proof*. Proof that your strategy works across different markets, that you can stick to your rules, that you know how to react when price goes sideways or your entry gets triggered faster than expected.

But here’s the real key: you have to treat your demo trades *like they’re real*. Log them. Track emotions. Reflect on why you entered, why you exited, and what you would do differently. That’s where the learning happens.

I spent my first month demo trading like it was a game. I’d enter random positions just to see what happened. When I finally transitioned to real capital, I wasn’t ready-and I lost fast. It wasn’t until I started journaling my fake trades like they were real money that things clicked. The patterns became clear. The dumb mistakes stood out. And my confidence became *earned*, not just imagined.

**What tools can help you analyze trades and improve over time?**

Let’s be honest: most people track their trades like they track their sleep-vaguely, inconsistently, and way too late. But if you’re not analyzing your trades, you’re not improving. You’re just guessing with a fancy user interface.

In 2025, the best traders are using trade journaling tools that go deeper than just “win” or “loss.” Tools that break down your behavior. Did you enter early? Exit late? Risk too much on a low-conviction setup? These platforms tell you, not just with numbers-but with patterns.

Apps like Tradervue or Edgewonk give you real-time data on your performance. But more importantly, they let you tag emotions, track setups, and visualize what’s actually working. Combine that with a screenshot habit-every setup, every exit-and suddenly you’re not just trading. You’re *learning*.

And you don’t need expensive software. A Google Sheet with four columns and honest entries can take you further than any overpriced tool if you use it consistently.

What helped me the most? Writing down one sentence after every trade. Just one. “I jumped in too early because I was bored.” That sentence alone told me more than the P&L ever could.

**Book Insight:** ***“Atomic Habits” by James Clear - Chapter 11: Walk Slowly, But Never Backward***

There’s a line in that chapter that hits different when you’re knee-deep in charts: **“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”**

You can dream about becoming a full-time trader all you want. But if you’re not building a system-one built around learning, tracking, and slow improvement-you’ll burn out before you ever get consistent.

The good news? Systems are built one tool, one habit, one trade at a time. You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to *show up and review*.

# Develop the Trader’s Mindset and Risk Discipline

*(Because Most Traders Don’t Blow Up From a Bad Strategy-They Blow Up From a Bad Reaction)*

**Why psychology is critical for trading success**

You can have the perfect strategy, the cleanest chart, and the best entry-but none of it matters if your head isn’t right.

Most people think trading is a technical game. But the longer you’re in it, the more you realize it’s mostly emotional. You’re not just managing charts. You’re managing fear, greed, doubt, FOMO, and the quiet voice that tells you to “just check that one more setup” even though you promised you were done for the day.

In 2025, with markets reacting faster than ever and social media adding pressure from every direction, staying emotionally stable is *the* edge. Not hype. Not prediction. Just *calm execution*. When everyone else is overtrading, revenge-trading, or panic-selling, the person who sticks to their plan wins by default.

I used to think mindset was some vague self-help thing traders talked about to sound wise. But I learned the hard way-mindset *is the edge*. Discipline is what separates lucky days from actual skill. You can’t control the market. But you can control *your response*.

**How to handle losses and stay emotionally stable**

Here’s the truth nobody wants to post on Instagram: you will lose. Even if you do everything right. Even if your setup is perfect. Losses aren’t mistakes. They’re tuition. You either pay with money or time, but either way-you pay.

What wrecks new traders isn’t losing. It’s what happens *after*. You take a red trade. You feel angry, embarrassed, disappointed. You want to make it back fast. So you jump into something impulsive, break your rules, double your position size-and now you’re down even more.

That spiral? That’s how most people blow up. Not the first red trade. The second and third made on emotion.

The shift happens when you stop seeing red days as failures and start treating them like *feedback*. A loss doesn’t mean you suck. It means something needs adjusting. Maybe your entry. Maybe your risk. Maybe your expectations.

For me, it was always about identity. If I lost, I felt like *I* was the failure. It wasn’t until I separated my trades from my self-worth that I started bouncing back faster. A bad trade didn’t ruin my day anymore. It just gave me something to review.

And that emotional stability? That’s the real flex.

**Risk-reward, stop-losses, and money management essentials**

Let’s talk mechanics for a second-because mindset needs structure to stay steady.

If you’re risking more than you’re comfortable losing, no amount of affirmations will save you when the trade goes against you. You’ll panic. You’ll make dumb choices. You’ll exit too early or hold too long, not based on logic-but fear.

This is why risk-reward matters. You need to know what you’re risking *before* you enter. If you’re risking $50, you should be aiming to make at least $100. Not because it sounds nice, but because the math works in your favor. Even if you’re right only half the time, you’ll still come out ahead.

Stop-losses aren’t about avoiding pain. They’re about preserving power. A small red now is better than a total account blowup later. And no-stop-losses aren’t weak. They’re strategic. Smart traders plan their exits before they even enter.

Money management isn’t optional. It’s your oxygen. Risking 1–2% per trade might sound boring, but it gives you staying power. And staying power is the only way you actually learn. You can’t get better if you’re constantly starting over.

I used to risk 10% of my account on every setup. I told myself it was “confidence.” But really, it was desperation. I wasn’t trading. I was gambling. When I finally dialed it back, something amazing happened: I started sleeping better-and trading better.

**Why tracking and journaling your trades accelerates mastery**

Here’s a hard truth: if you don’t track your trades, you don’t really *know* what’s working.

You might think you’re good at breakouts, but your journal says otherwise. You might feel like your losses are random-but your screenshots show you keep chasing entries late. The numbers don’t lie. But if you don’t record them, your brain will.

Trading journals are where your edge gets sharpened. They show you patterns-*your* patterns. The good ones, the bad ones, the blind spots you keep repeating.

In 2025, top traders are using journaling like athletes use game tape. They study themselves. Not because they love self-critique, but because they want to win. And you can’t improve what you don’t measure.

For me, the biggest mindset unlock came when I started treating my journal like my coach. I’d write what I saw. What I felt. Why I entered. Why I hesitated. And I’d review it once a week. No judgment. Just data. The lessons came fast-and they stuck.

**Book Insight:** ***“The Daily Trading Coach” by Brett Steenbarger - Chapter 12: Journaling and Self-Talk***

There’s a quote in this chapter that should be printed above every trader’s desk: **“We don’t trade the markets. We trade our beliefs about the markets.”**

Journaling helps you see those beliefs. Which ones are helping you? Which ones are sabotaging your trades? Which stories are you repeating without even realizing it?

Once you see it, you can change it. That’s where growth begins.

# Stay Sharp and Evolve With the Market in 2025

*(Because What Worked Last Year Might Be Useless Tomorrow-and the Market Won’t Warn You First)*

**How new technologies like AI and blockchain affect market behavior**

If 2024 was the year of AI headlines, 2025 is the year those headlines became the infrastructure. You’re not just trading against other humans anymore. You’re trading against models. Bots. Institutions running predictive algorithms that scan global sentiment before your morning coffee is even brewed.

AI doesn’t just change how fast markets move-it changes *why* they move. When an earnings report drops, there are systems parsing every sentence, scoring sentiment, and executing trades in milliseconds. A politician tweets? The impact is processed and priced in before you even see it.

Blockchain’s evolution hasn’t slowed either. The tokenization of real-world assets-real estate, commodities, even startup equity-has blurred the line between traditional finance and DeFi. That means new markets are opening up. New behaviors. New liquidity patterns. And new risks.

If you’re ignoring these shifts, you’re not just behind-you’re trading in a world that no longer exists. Staying sharp in 2025 means being curious about tech, not intimidated by it. You don’t need to be a developer. But you *do* need to know the difference between a layer-1 upgrade and a market manipulation event disguised as “protocol volatility.”

The market is evolving whether you’re ready or not. So make staying ready part of your process.

**What are the top asset classes and sectors to watch in 2025?**

The spotlight has shifted. And no, it’s not just another AI bubble or meme coin pump.

Right now, energy is moving again-especially renewables tied to government incentives and green infrastructure projects. AI hardware? Booming. Not just because of demand, but because supply chains are shifting fast, and companies are racing to build their own chips.

Healthcare tech is also in play. Biotech innovations are surging thanks to machine learning in diagnostics and drug discovery. That means longer hold swing trades with real catalysts-earnings, trials, policy changes-are back in focus.

Crypto hasn’t disappeared, but it’s matured. The hype is quieter, but the infrastructure is more real than ever. If you’re only watching top 10 coins, you’re missing the innovation happening in Layer-2 ecosystems, gaming tokens with actual adoption, and protocols building AI-native applications.

And commodities? Still dependable. Gold remains a safe haven when macro anxiety spikes, while lithium and rare earth metals have become strategic assets as countries fight over battery production dominance.

But here’s the real key: don’t just follow the hot sectors. Understand *why* they’re moving. Is it real demand? Policy-driven? Supply chain risk? Hype? When you know the story, you know the setup. When you don’t, you’re just chasing shadows.

**How to adapt your strategy to market volatility and new conditions**

The traders who last are the ones who adapt. You can’t trade a bull market with bear market habits. You can’t short like a pro when the trend is vertical and every dip gets bought by bots. Conditions change-and your strategy has to move with them.

That doesn’t mean reinventing everything every month. It means staying aware. Asking yourself weekly: Is this market trending or ranging? Are news events causing overreactions or being shrugged off? Is volume drying up or surging?

It also means building flexibility into your system. Maybe that means switching timeframes. Maybe it means reducing position sizes during choppy conditions. Maybe it means sitting out altogether until your setup comes back.

I used to think “sitting out” was weakness. Now I see it as a skill. The hardest decision is *no trade*, especially when everyone else on Reddit is flexing wins. But not trading in bad conditions? That’s how you preserve capital. And preserving capital is how you *stay in the game* long enough to crush the next opportunity.

One of the best things I did was build a checklist that asks: “Is the market environment favorable for my edge?” If the answer is no, I don’t trade. Period. That rule has saved me more money than any stop-loss ever has.

**Book Insight:** ***“Antifragile” by Nassim Nicholas Taleb - Chapter 13: The Nonlinear and the Nonpredictive***

There’s a line in that chapter that feels like it was written for traders in 2025: **“Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder.”**

Great traders are *antifragile*. They don’t just survive chaos-they *use* it. They learn faster. Adjust faster. And because of that, they thrive when others fold.

That’s the mindset. That’s the mission. Build a system that evolves, not just a strategy that copies.

  


# FAQ

*(Because You’ve Got Questions, and Google Keeps Serving You 5-Year-Old Blog Posts)*

**How long does it take to master trading in 2025?**

The unpopular truth? Mastering trading doesn’t happen in six months. You don’t “master” it like a video game. You *build fluency*, like a second language-and fluency takes time.

For most people, it takes **12 to 24 months** of consistent effort just to stop making the same emotional mistakes. And that’s *if* you’re showing up every week, tracking your trades, reviewing your wins and losses, and adjusting based on data-not dopamine.

It’s not about how long you’ve been in the game. It’s about how many focused reps you’ve done. Watching YouTube for 6 hours straight isn’t the same as logging 6 hours of structured practice, journaling, or live trading reviews.

The traders who actually “make it”? They’re still learning. Still testing. Still humble. Because the moment you think you’ve mastered the market, it humbles you. Hard.



**Do I need a financial degree to learn trading?**

No. You need curiosity, discipline, and the ability to take accountability when you mess up. That’s it.

In fact, some of the most dangerous traders are the ones with just enough finance education to be overconfident-but not enough emotional control to survive the reality of a real trading account.

Finance degrees can teach you theory. But trading teaches you **psychology, adaptability, and resilience**. None of that comes in a syllabus. It comes from red trades, mismanaged risk, and the choice to come back smarter instead of quitting.

I’ve met high school dropouts pulling consistent profit and MBA grads blowing up $10K accounts. The difference isn’t IQ. It’s *emotional awareness + strategic reps*.

If you can manage your emotions, track your behavior, and learn in public (yes, even when it sucks), you’re already ahead of half the field.



**Can I start with a small budget and still succeed?**

Absolutely. In fact, starting small is a huge advantage if you use it right.

Most people fantasize about trading big, but a large account only magnifies bad habits. When you start with $100, $200, or $500, you’re forced to learn risk management. You have to be precise. You’re not swinging for home runs-you’re building muscle.

The real play is *treating that small account like a six-figure fund*. Not in risk, but in process. If you journal every trade, review your setups, and act like you’re managing serious capital-you’re preparing for it.

I started with $250. It didn’t grow fast. But it *taught me everything*. Because when you only have a little, every decision matters. That urgency? That’s where discipline is born.

Growth will come. But don’t chase it. Protect your capital. Earn your confidence. Let compounding and consistency do their thing.



**What’s the best way to stay consistent and avoid burnout?**

Consistency in trading doesn’t come from motivation. It comes from systems, boundaries, and honest self-checks.

Set a schedule. Trade at times that fit your life-not some fantasy full-time trader routine. If you only have 45 minutes at night? Great. Make that the sharpest 45 minutes possible.

Burnout happens when you overtrade, overanalyze, and obsess over outcomes instead of process. When every trade feels like a referendum on your self-worth, you’re not trading. You’re chasing validation.

Take breaks. Walk away on red days. Do a weekly review, not a daily meltdown. And most importantly-*talk to other traders*. Not just to flex. To reflect. Accountability and connection matter more than you think.

One thing that saved me: I started journaling how I felt after each trading session. Not just P&L. Emotions. Energy. Focus. That one habit showed me when burnout was creeping in-before it wrecked me.

**Book Insight:** ***“Deep Work” by Cal Newport - Chapter 4: The Rules of Focused Success in a Distracted World***

There’s a line that applies *perfectly* to trading in the age of constant alerts and crypto noise: “Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not.”

If trading matters to you, cut the noise. Build your process. Make space for deep, focused reps. Because that’s where consistency lives. Not in motivation. In clarity, repetition, and rest.

## ⁤Key Features Analysis

The modern Magic Keyboard skin offers a variety of features⁤ designed​ to enhance ‌both protection and user experience.

**Material Quality:** The best magic‍ Keyboard skins are crafted from high-quality materials like TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) or premium silicone. These materials offer excellent resistance to abrasion,scratches,and even minor spills. The quality of the material also dictates the skin's ​durability and longevity.

Modern tpu offers enhanced openness, allowing the original keyboard aesthetic to shine through, while providing superior ⁣protection against yellowing over time. Premium silicone, on the other hand, offers a softer, more tactile feel and frequently enough comes in a ​wider range of ⁣colors and finishes. The choice⁢ ultimately depends on your preference for feel and aesthetic.

**Precise Fit and Cutouts:** A well-designed ‌Magic Keyboard skin⁣ boasts a precise fit, adhering snugly to the‌ keyboard's contours without interfering with key travel⁤ or functionality. Accurate cutouts are crucial​ for accommodating the keyboard's ports, sensors, and the⁤ Apple logo. Imperfect cutouts can obstruct functionality and detract ⁢from the overall appearance.

A laser-cutting process is employed in manufacturing many​ top-tier skins, guaranteeing accuracy ‍down to‍ the millimeter. This ensures⁢ that each key is clearly visible and accessible, without any unnecessary overlap or obstruction. The careful attention ​to ⁣detail in ‍the design and manufacturing process is a⁤ hallmark⁣ of a high-quality skin.

**Tactile Feedback and Typing Experience:** The texture and thickness of a Magic Keyboard skin ⁢directly impact the typing experience.The best skins aim to provide a‍ comfortable and responsive tactile feedback while minimizing any negative impact on key travel or typing speed.⁤ A skin that's ‌too thick or⁤ inflexible can make typing feel sluggish and uncomfortable.

Manufacturers often utilize a micro-textured surface to enhance grip and prevent slippage,⁤ further contributing to a more confident and accurate typing experience. Some skins even‍ incorporate textured keycaps to mimic the feel of a⁣ traditional mechanical keyboard. This thoughtful design can improve both ⁢the comfort ‌and speed of prolonged typing sessions.

**Ease of Installation and Removal:** The ideal Magic Keyboard skin⁤ should be easy to install and remove without leaving any residue or damaging the keyboard's surface.‌ Static cling‍ or reusable adhesive is typically used to secure the skin in place, allowing for⁣ effortless request and removal.

Reputable brands frequently enough provide detailed installation instructions and even video tutorials to guide users through the​ process. The ability to easily remove and reapply the skin is especially useful ⁣for cleaning⁢ or ​switching ⁤between different skins to match your mood or⁢ style. A good skin​ should​ offer a‍ balance between secure adhesion and easy removal.

Key features of excellent Magic Keyboard skins include:

*   High-quality TPU ‌or Silicone material
*   Precise,‌ laser-cut ‍design
*   Non-slip coating
*  ⁤ Easy to clean

## ‍Core Benefits

Investing in a Magic Keyboard skin offers a multitude of practical benefits that extend beyond basic protection.

**Damage Prevention:** The primary benefit of a Magic Keyboard skin is its ability to protect your keyboard from scratches, spills, ⁤and⁢ dust. Accidents⁤ happen, and a simple spill of coffee or a dropped crumb can wreak havoc ⁢on delicate electronics. A skin acts as a barrier, preventing liquids from seeping into the keyboard's internal​ components and shielding the keys from abrasive particles.

By providing a physical shield⁢ against daily wear‍ and tear, ⁢a ⁢skin can substantially extend the lifespan of your Magic Keyboard and help maintain its pristine condition. this is ‍especially valuable for those who ​frequently use their ⁤keyboards in environments where they are exposed to potential hazards. The cost of skin ​pales in comparison to the cost of repairing or replacing a ​damaged keyboard.

**Customization:**‍ Magic Keyboard⁣ skins are available in a⁣ wide array of colors, patterns, and designs, allowing you ⁤to personalize your‌ keyboard to match⁢ your style or workspace aesthetics.Whether you prefer a minimalist obvious skin ⁢or a vibrant, eye-catching design, there's a skin to suit every taste.

Many manufacturers also offer custom printing options, allowing you​ to create truly unique skins featuring your own artwork, logos, or personal messages. ‍This level of personalization transforms your Magic Keyboard from a purely functional ​tool into‌ a statement piece that reflects‍ your ‍individuality. The ability to easily switch between different skins also allows you to update your keyboard's look ⁣whenever you desire.

**Improved Hygiene:** Keyboards are notorious breeding ⁢grounds for bacteria and ‍germs. Regular ⁤cleaning is essential, but it can be challenging ‍to thoroughly disinfect the crevices between the keys. Magic ⁤Keyboard skins‍ provide a smooth, easily wipeable ⁢surface that simplifies cleaning and sanitization.

With a skin in place, you can quickly wipe away dirt, grime, and germs with ⁤a damp cloth or disinfectant wipe, keeping⁤ your keyboard clean and hygienic. This is particularly significant‌ for shared workspaces⁣ or for ⁤individuals who are⁢ concerned about maintaining a healthy environment. A clean keyboard not only looks better, but it also contributes to overall well-being.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently⁤ asked questions‍ about Magic keyboard skins.

**Will a keyboard skin affect‌ my typing experience?**
While a very thin ⁢skin ⁤might be‍ almost imperceptible, most keyboard skins will subtly change the feel of ⁣typing. High-quality skins are designed to ⁢minimize this impact, using materials that provide a‌ good balance of protection and tactile feedback. If you're⁢ concerned about typing feel, look for ‍skins that are explicitly designed to ⁤maintain a tactile typing experience

**Are Magic ‌Keyboard skins reusable?**
Generally, most magic keyboard skins can be removed and reapplied multiple times, even though the adhesive properties may diminish with repeated use or improper handling. It's essential to follow the manufacturer's instructions for installation and removal to avoid damaging the skin or the keyboard. Cleaning the skin periodically can also help maintain‍ its adhesive properties.

**Can​ I wash my keyboard skin?**
Yes, ‍most Magic Keyboard skins made of​ silicone or TPU can⁢ be washed with mild soap⁣ and water. Make sure to thoroughly dry the‌ skin before reapplying it to the keyboard. Avoid ⁢using harsh chemicals‌ or abrasive ‍cleaners, as these can damage the skin's material ⁤or finish.

I wanna thank everyone back then for sharing your opinions and special thanks to those who shared some advice! It helped me a lot and especially thank you to this one person name “chunked”. He inspired me to do this, what Im about to tell you.


So I contact her on her birthday sending her a long final emotional letter with everything I wanted to say and also a lil birthday gift. 

To keep it short and less insane, i learned the last few months making music(I never made music in my life before, but it somehow worked) and I released a single “oh mari by nkio” if someone is interested and ofc I showed her an almost completed album I made for her.

Context: We joked around in the cat coffee shop and she asked me “would you still make a song for me”. I replied “I would make an album for you”. 

Surprisingly she was stunned and reacted to it with so much joy. We agreed on a second date shortly. We talk things out there, what happen and that she questioned her decision alot in the time we didnt talked. We agreed on giving it a try now.

Wish us luck! Cause that would be a great “how I met your mother” story if its work out! :)",1,1752149468.0,entp,0,1.0,False

Now we have that out of the way…

I’m fucking tired of my life. Sick and fucking tired. Where do I even begin?! When my kids (4.5yo & 2yo)  are sweet, they’re the best. But outside of that, they’re loud, whiny, demanding, and fucking impossible to take anywhere. We can’t sit down in a cafe for a coffee because it’s a never ending shit storm and so fucking embarrassing. The 4.5yo does okay sometimes. But the 2yo screams and fusses and whines. When we take them to kid-fun places they still whine and moan and misbehave the whole time. Parks, children’s museums, library, soft play, the zoo… it doesn’t matter. It’s nonstop moaning and bad behaviour and epic tantrums from the youngest. But then at home they whine about being bored. 

I know some of it is age appropriate, but for fuck’s sake. We can’t fucking win. Ever. And the constant fidgeting, making noise, bouncing, spinning, climbing fucking everything. And the tantrums, good heavens, the fucking tantrums. I’m at my wits end. 

And as much as I love my husband, he’s a massive source of stress and frustration. He’s obviously depressed for a long list of reasons including his weight (that he’s doing nothing to fix), his lack of sleep (again, not seeking an answer), his miserable job, and our finances. I get it. I’ve tried everything to help. I’ve switched my diet in support of him, but he’s given up. I took up exercising, he’s given up. He’s looking for another job in a different place because we hate where we live, but it’s a slow process because he refuses to do any job that he deems pointless (a paycheck is not a sufficient reason). He won’t see any sort of doctor for anything. He won’t buy the proper size clothes and instead is forcing himself into his smaller clothes then being pissed off about it. He’s just miserable. 

I hate our house. It’s a fucking shoebox. I wish my grown stepdaughter would come get the rest of her crap from the room we need to turn into our son’s room because right now the kids share a room and it’s not working. I hate the white fucking carpet. I hate the never ending chores. I literally hand wash 4 loads of dishes (5 on the days my husband is off) every fucking day. I’m tired of laundry. I hate cleaning the bathrooms. I’m fucking tired of toys everywhere. 

I love my kids, I do. But I miss so much of my life before a family. I was in great shape. My brain actually functioned properly. I was actually smart. Like I could retain information. I loved cooking great meals. I read loads of books. I was adventurous. I had hobbies and interests. I had friends. I was happy. 

Before you suggest it, therapy is not an option right now. So please just don’t. I have no friends. My family lives 4,000 miles away and besides, my mom is a train wreck and my dad and stepmom are the types who are constantly busy for the sake of being busy. They’ve never even met my kids in person. 

I occasionally daydream about just disappearing into the night. Off to somewhere nobody knows me and just living a quiet, simple life. ",5,1752149222.0,breakingmom,2,1.0,False

I've owned several models and have compared them extensively with other brands.

The build quality is impressive - they use rust-resistant aluminum frames that have held up well even after repeated exposure to salt water and sand. The fabric is thick, durable polyester that resists fading and tearing. Mine still looks great after two summers of heavy use.

What really sets them apart is the attention to detail. The backpack straps are well-padded and make carrying the chair a breeze. The insulated cooler pouch keeps drinks cold for hours, and the side storage pockets are perfect for sunscreen, phones, and other beach essentials.

However, they aren't perfect. The price point is higher than basic beach chairs, typically ranging from $60-80. If you're looking for more affordable alternatives that still offer good quality, I found some excellent options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Foldable-Beach-Chairs

The recline positions are smooth and secure - I've never had issues with the chair slipping or collapsing. The weight capacity is solid too, supporting up to 300 pounds on most models. The feet are well-designed and don't sink too deeply into the sand.

One feature I particularly appreciate is the towel bar at the back. It's perfect for drying swimsuits or towels while you relax. The built-in cup holder is sturdy and fits most drink sizes, from water bottles to coffee cups.

Maintenance is straightforward - just rinse with fresh water after beach use and let it dry completely before storing. I've found they're quite resistant to rust, but it's still good practice to keep them clean.

For those interested in exploring different options or finding current deals on beach chairs, including Tommy Bahama models, check out this curated selection: https://explorehomedeals.com/Foldable-Beach-Chairs

Remember to consider your specific needs - if you frequently walk long distances to reach your beach spot, the lightweight design and backpack straps make Tommy Bahama chairs an excellent choice. They're also perfect for concerts, camping, and outdoor sports events.

The five-year warranty shows the company's confidence in their product, though I've rarely heard of anyone needing to use it. The chairs are built to last, and with proper care, they can serve you well for many seasons.

From my experience, while Tommy Bahama chairs are a bit pricier than basic models, the durability, comfort, and thoughtful features make them a worthwhile investment for regular beach-goers.",1,1752149177.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

1lwawfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledkids/comments/1lwawfy/this_kid_tried_to_fine_me_for_sitting_on_his_park/,This kid tried to fine me for sitting on his park bench.,"So last weekend, I took my dog for a walk to this quiet park near my apartment. It is usually a chill place where old folks do tai chi and couples have little picnics. I had my coffee, my dog, and everything was going great. I sat down on this bench under a big oak tree. It is my go-to spot.

About ten minutes in, this random kid, maybe around ten or eleven, comes marching up to me like he owns the place. Arms crossed. Total attitude.

He goes, ""Uh, excuse me. You are sitting on my bench.""

I thought it was some kind of joke, so I chuckled and said, ""Oh yeah? I don’t see your name on it.""

He did not laugh. Instead, he pulled this crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket and handed it to me. It looked like it had been drawn in crayon. It said, ""Park Bench Ownership Certificate. Owner: Jason M. Only I can sit here. Everyone else must pay a five dollar fine.""

I kid you not, there were also signatures from his mom, his stuffed bear, and someone listed as ""The Mayor,"" which honestly looked like his own handwriting with a curly wig drawn next to it.

He looked dead serious and said, ""So unless you want to pay the fine, you need to move.""

At this point, I was actually kind of impressed by how far he had taken it. I smiled and said, ""Kid, I do not think that is legally binding.""

He stomped his foot and yelled, ""My mom said I can make my own rules here! If you do not pay, I am calling the police!""

Now a few other people in the park were watching this unfold, trying not to laugh.

So I pulled out my phone and pretended to make a call. I said loudly, ""Hello? Yeah, this is the Bench Police. We have a Code Crayon here.""

The kid’s eyes went wide like saucers. He let out this dramatic scream, ""NOOO!"" and bolted. He kept yelling, ""I am telling my mom you are a criminal!"" as he ran away.

I never saw him again after that. But honestly, somewhere out there, he is probably writing up more ""official"" documents for world domination.",3,1752148841.0,entitledkids,0,0.8,False
1lwaw47,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepEssentialsIndia/comments/1lwaw47/what_to_eat_and_skip_for_better_sleep/,What to Eat (and Skip) for Better Sleep,"What you eat does more than keep you going during the day. It also shapes how deeply and peacefully you sleep at night. A **bio-energetic nutrition** approach focuses on nutrient-dense, minimally processed foods that support metabolism and thermoregulation, two key pieces that help your body relax and stay asleep.

Below, I’ll walk you through what this looks like in practice, the foods to prioritize, what to avoid, and practical steps you can try right away.


### What is Bio-Energetic Nutrition?

At its core, bio-energetic nutrition means choosing foods that your body uses efficiently to produce energy, balance hormones, and keep body temperature steady. If metabolism or thermoregulation is off, your chances of tossing and turning go up.

The goal isn’t to follow strict rules but to eat in a way that aligns with how our bodies naturally work.


### Key Foods That Support Sleep

These foods help stabilize blood sugar, support neurotransmitter production (like serotonin and melatonin), and regulate temperature.

| Food | Why it helps | Practical tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Grass-fed meats | Rich in protein, iron, zinc, B vitamins; help keep blood sugar steady | Aim for about 1 gram of protein per pound of ideal body weight |
| Organ meats | High in vitamins A, D, B12, folate, magnesium | Use freeze-dried supplements if you don’t like the taste |
| Grass-fed dairy (if tolerated) | Provides calcium and magnesium for muscle relaxation | Try yogurt, kefir, or cream; eliminate for 30–90 days if sensitivity suspected |
| Adequate salt | Supports adrenal health and electrolyte balance | Start with 6–10 grams daily; adjust based on your needs |
| Stearic acid and healthy fats | Help keep energy stable and support fat metabolism | Grass-fed suet or stearic acid supplements work here |


### Foods and Drinks to Limit or Avoid

Some foods can keep you wired or disrupt hormones that regulate sleep.

| Item | Why to avoid | What to do instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coffee | Raises cortisol, delays melatonin, contains compounds that stress the body | Cut it out entirely or switch to herbal teas |
| Polyunsaturated seed oils | Promote inflammation and disrupt hormone balance | Use saturated fats like ghee, butter, or coconut oil |
| Sugary or starchy foods | Cause blood sugar spikes and crashes, leading to night wake-ups | Focus on whole, nutrient-dense meals |

### Watch for Nutritional Deficiencies

Deficiencies can quietly mess with sleep by raising stress hormones or impairing neurotransmitter production.

| Nutrient | Why it matters | Food sources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Magnesium & calcium | Calm the nervous system, reduce cramps | Bone meal, dairy, organ meats |
| B vitamins & folate | Support methylation and hormone production | Organ meats, supplements |
| Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium) | Prevent nighttime cramps and keep the nervous system balanced | High-quality salt, bone meal, varied diet |

If you suspect gaps, blood tests like homocysteine levels can help identify issues.


### How This Supports Thermoregulation

Your body temperature naturally drops at night to help you sleep. Eating nutrient-dense foods helps:

*   Provide steady energy for heat regulation
    
*   Reduce inflammation that disrupts temperature control
    
*   Support hormones (melatonin, cortisol) that guide the sleep cycle
    

Without enough fuel or with too much processed food, your body may overheat, get cold, or feel restless.


### Practical Tips to Try

Here’s what you can do based on nutritional science:

| Step | Why it helps |
| --- | --- |
| Build meals around grass-fed meats and organ meats | Stabilizes blood sugar and provides needed micronutrients |
| Finish eating 2–3 hours before bed | Avoids digestive stress that can raise cortisol |
| Gradually cut coffee | Prevents sudden withdrawal symptoms |
| Use clean water | Supports hydration and thermoregulation |
| Experiment with salt | Helps if you get cramps or feel drained |
| Eliminate suspected sensitivities (like dairy) for 30–90 days | See if sleep improves |


### Helpful Products (Optional)

These can make it easier to follow a bio-energetic diet:

| Product | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Redmond Real Salt (32 oz) | Natural sodium and trace minerals |
| Bone Meal | Calcium and boron |
| Grass-fed Organ Complex | Convenient organ nutrients |
| Freeze-Dried Liver | Nutrient boost |
| Stearic acid products | Support fat metabolism |
| Heart & Soil Fire Starter | Targeted nutrients for metabolism |


### Why This Matters

Better sleep starts earlier than bedtime, it starts at the dinner table (and even breakfast). When you give your body what it needs to regulate hormones and temperature, you lay the groundwork for deeper, longer sleep.

It’s not about chasing perfect meals but about steady, nutrient-rich choices over time. Try a few changes, see how you feel, and keep what works.",1,1752148814.0,SleepEssentialsIndia,0,1.0,False

I’m reaching out again in hopes of finding someone I connect with. This can be an admittedly odd format, but here we go again! 

I live a peaceful life. In so many ways I should be content in it. I have no “Great War” I’m waging. I have everything I need. I’m just missing my person. I don’t want to change the world, I just want to hold someone’s hand. To sit quietly and share a moment in the stillness of the night (preferably over tea or coffee). I guess I’m lonely. But I’ve never viewed loneliness as a purely negative space to occupy. I have a rich inner world, and should I never find someone I would be okay. But I know I want to share my life with someone. So I keep putting myself out there. I left a post from the other day up on my profile that may have more details. 

I’m 6’5”, brown hair, and bluish green eyes. Average weight. Sometimes I wear glasses. 

I’m looking for someone who craves deep conversations. Who loves to read and talk about what they are reading. Who loves to visit art museums. Or, maybe none of these things. Who knows? If you reach out, please tell me a bit about yourself! Regardless of whether I hear from you, I hope everyone finds their person.

1lwavdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/1lwavdq/poolside_picks_big_brother_fantasy_legue_from/,"Poolside Picks - Big Brother Fantasy Legue. From Excel Power User to SaaS Founder - 10 Years of ""Market Research"" Paid Off","I work in a client facing role in tech. No technical background. No CS degree. For over a decade, I ran a Big Brother fantasy league for friends - just for fun. It lived in a ridiculously complicated Excel workbook with layers of hidden formulas, color-coded rankings, and manual score tracking. People kept saying, “You should sell this!” but I always thought, Only I can run this chaotic beast. No one else would ever figure it out.

But here's the twist: I had accidentally been doing market research for 10 years.

I already had:

* A proven group of loyal users
* Feedback on every feature they wished existed
* Years of iterating on what made it fun
* People who would pay for it if I just made it easier

Then the BB27 premiere date crept up, and I thought: What if I actually built it?

**The Lightbulb Moment:**  
After a decade of broken formulas, PDF updates, and email chains, I realized my spreadsheet wasn't just a hobby - it was a prototype.

**The Build (8 Days of Chaos):**

* **July 2:** Discovered Lovable. Knew nothing.
* **July 2–4:** Crash course in databases, user auth, and basic app logic.
* **July 5–7:** Built league tools, admin controls, payment processing.
* **July 8–9:** Beta tested with real users, fixed bugs, drank too much coffee.
* **July 10 (Launch Day):** Had to launch today, because BB27 premiered tonight. No choice.

All while working full-time in client services. The 2 AM debugging sessions were... bleak. But missing the premiere meant waiting a whole year.

**What I Built:**  
A fully functional fantasy sports platform, but for reality TV:

* Draft your own fantasy team of houseguests
* Score points based on 25+ customizable events
* Weekly prediction questions
* Real-time leaderboards
* Multi-league management
* Admin tools for league creators
* Mobile-friendly interface
* Optional payment support for league buy-ins

Everything is customizable: team size, scoring logic, bonus questions, even who’s allowed to draft which houseguests. It’s weirdly flexible and I kind of love that.

**Stats (so far):**

* Launched today with existing users
* Multiple leagues already running
* $0 marketing budget—just word of mouth
* Revenue model: Tip jar suggesting % of league buy-ins

**What’s Next:**

* AI integration to automate weekly event scoring
* Email updates for leagues (rank changes, points gained, etc.)
* Expand to Survivor, Love Island, The Traitors, etc.
* Possibly white-label for other niche fantasy markets

 **Takeaways:**

* Your weird spreadsheet hobby might actually be market research
* Users will tell you what to build if you listen
* You can go from zero tech skills to shipping a platform
* Sometimes you just need a hard deadline to get it out the door

It still blows my mind that I went from Excel power user to... I guess SaaS founder?

1lwasob,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpatFIRE/comments/1lwasob/18_months_of_expat_fire/,18 months of Expat Fire & $$,"Background: Early 40s Male & in  Feb 2024 left my corporate job and retired (planned).

I spent most of 2024 travelling Asia and SE Asia crossing out some buckelist items..

I've spent time in Thailand island hopping, living in Bangkok, spent a month island hopping the Phillippines (Cebu, El Nido, Coron, Siquijor, Kawasan Falls, Siargio). Spent over 3 months living in Da Nang Vietnam  surfing, and riding my motorbike through the mountains of the Ho chi Minh road, and through the mountain passes of the Ha Giang Loop.

I spent far little time in Indonesia surfing in Bali, living an boat, swimming with giant manta rays and  chilling with the komodo dragons.  (Spending more time in Indo this upcoming month).

Late last year once my long term Thailand visa was approved, I decided to get a home base in the Bangkok Area.   I still travel internationally every 90 days or so and at least a domestic trips every 45-60.

Early Retirement has been great.  Spend a lot of time at the gym and just doing what I like to do.  Walk, drink coffee, listen to pods.

What I think I'm learning through this journey:  since my retirement date and this next decade- it will be my highest spending years for sure.   18 months in and I cannot keep up this pace of travelling and doing all these adventures.  At 43 my body is getting tired 😆.  I try to stay active (6'1 and 185 lbs) but father time says relax.

Retiring early I was for sure concerned if I have/had enough.  It will always longer on the back of my mind.  But my spending habits will most likely decrease as the years go by. Less crazy travel, less drinking etc.  I was short sighted and maybe so eager for so many adventures.

What I'm learning is:  I made the right decision.  You never get your youth back, your energy etc.  I would have loved to experienced these things in my 20s.  I meet so many 20 somethings and see them enjoying it and I'm happy for them.    Sure I was working away building a great career and investing.  I don't regret my choices.  It allowed me to retire when I did.

Would I like to have a higher budget ?  Of course who wouldn't ..   but I wouldn't change the higher budget for what I've experienced these 18 months while still able bodied and energetic.

I'm not trying to make a point with this post.  Just voicing my experience and what I'm learning about myself.

I went into this with the goal to pull 3-4% of NW a year.   

18 months in since Feb 2024 and my networth is up just shy of 200k.    My spending is around 40k USD a year.  Can easily get that down to 36k if I needed and have buffer to go up to 50k a year if needed as well.

She's round his a lot when our 2 daughters (10 & 12) are there and they've all been on short breaks in UK with her & her kids (primary age and toddler).

Ex has not intro'd us though, and on my first suggestion to say hello to her, I was told by him not to approach her on the school run etc (kids go to same school!). But I've bumped into her a few times in our neighbourhood and we introduced ourselves, had friendly chat and agreed to 'not be a stranger' if we see one another. So far so friendly, kids like her, I like her.

We coparent kids 50/50 2-3 days on/off (mutually agreed, no court orders etc). He's requested a whole week he can have them in Aug. Assuming for a holiday (but he's not used that word!). Eldest daughter has said it's because they're all going on holiday again - but this time possibly abroad, she thinks Spain or Italy.

**A few things to ask your opinion, Redditfriends:**

\- **Ex has not told me anything about this holiday so far and they're due to go 1st Aug!** I've emailed to ask if they're going further away than the usual, if so can he fill me in with details. No response about that (he doesn't tell me if he's taking them other places like Cornwall either - just goes and I don't know if they're home or away). 

\- **I hold the kids passports at the mo. If he does need them I'd like them back after**. I don't think he'd ever do a total permanent runner but he's very closed and avoidant with me and I'd rather have control of the passports. Plus I gave birth to these two kids, in a world where handmaids tale doesn't feel too far removed I feel better holding the passports! How to explain this to him?

\-**I'd like to know his GF a bit better** \- as she's the other 'responsible adult' when they go away with the kids. She seems very friendly and I trust her. I'd like to bypass my Ex and just ask her directly for a coffee, no interrogations or slating my Ex just friendly chat (might need to stalk her slightly to get her DM on Insta or work email to do this - would this be weird?)

Ex can be disdainful towards me and his avoidant behaviour causes me to need to repeat requests etc then makes me feel I'm overdoing it! So I just need to be careful how I word stuff to avoid myself getting emotionally exhausted from his responses to normal requests (thank god for chat gpt to help me with this!)

OK, it’s like this. I don’t know if the reference will resonate with you, but you’ve probably heard of the video game Dark Souls.



Dark Souls has a reputation for being very hard.



“Is Dark souls hard?” cry the reddit posts. “Help! I’m stuck in Dark Souls! It’s too hard!”



Is Dark Souls really too hard?



Of course it isn’t. But you have to GIT GUD.



You have to know when to block and when to roll. You have to learn the patterns of the mobs. You need to know where the treasures and shortcuts are.



It requires three things. Practice, patience, and the support of the community.



I think you see where this is going.



So as you can tell, Dark Souls is not only not too hard, it’s rewarding and engaging once you know how to play. It’s soul crushing on the path towards it, and you die and you die and you die.



But you see improvement. It’s not too hard. It’s beatable.



You know this because A) other people have done it and B) you can see your character getting stronger little by little.



Let’s stop talking about Dark Souls, let’s talk about the apps. 



Full disclosure: I'm a teacher and learning mentor. The first hurdle I have with any situation is the negative mindset. I’ll often play games or do activites with the student to show them they are capable of achievement. 



We can’t do that so you’ll need to focus on things you like and something that motivates you. There obviously is something, but there’s all this no in your head.



I’ll be honest as well the negativity in most cases and especially in men 20-30 is just laziness.



Let’s get to the apps.







1. Make a decent profile. Normal pictures including one or two of you in an interesting place or doing a totally random thing. You might want to get a friend to take some photos of you. I posed for all my profile pics and pretended they were just causal. I don’t use instagram or facebook so I didn’t have any ready. I went to the effort of taking them. I didn’t waste time worrying whether I was attractive or anything like that but I made sure they were decent photos.
2. Go on Boo, Bumble or Hinge and write a description that specifically targets the kind of girl you want to meet.
3. Get swiping. Tinder is fine, you can use it as well, I would use 2 or 3 apps. Tinder and Hinge allow you to message your matches first which is vital. 
4. You will need to dedicate about 30 mins of solid swiping and messaging a week. Not a lot to ask but you must do it consistently. You won’t get many matches at first but just keep at it. It’s an algorithm. You’re also better off not swiping on attractive women with boring profiles. Only swipe on women who seem like a match and try to stick to a pattern.
5. Don’t give up. It will work. Think how many thousands of girls are out there wanting to meet someone.
6. Once you start getting matches start sending messages. Act quickly. Do not just leave matches hanging. And send a proper message. You wouldn’t believe the amount of guys who are just sending “hey” and then complaining the apps don’t work. Send a few sentences just with some attention grabbers. I’d write an opener and just copy paste it to everyone. Just put some funny things in there about what you’re up to, refine it over time, and leave space to mention one thing on their profile and ask a question to engage them. Rejig it where needed so it doesn’t look like copy paste and deny it if asked.
7. Then finally you can get to the messaging. Now you can actually find out if you enjoy talking to the girl or not. Send a few long messages, no “hi”, “what you upt to”, don’t be lame basically. Find out about your match. And after about 3-5 messages depending on information gained suggest the meet up. A coffee or a drink at a bar at a mutually agreed spot. I’m British so I always suggested a pub, but depending on your sensibilities a coffee might be better. Don’t bother with any fancy dates like you see on reality TV. You just need to meet and find out if there’s a connection.
8. Finally, your next wave of XP comes from getting the girl to the date and practicing your chatting skills. No date is a bad date. Even if there’s nothing in common you can practice your body language, confidence, jokes, any of it. If you sense a date isn’t going well you can even be outrageous (always respectful, never rude or slimy) and see what happens. It’s all XP for next time. If the girl was attractive but there’s no chemistry, you can always ask her for a second date or even a kiss just to practicxe getting rejected (or even be in for a surprise!)
9. Normal practice is to say nothing and leave awkwardly and text later with your fingers crossed to see if a second dates’ on the cards. Now this can be the hardest part because inevitably a lot of these dates will not make it to date two. This is fine. You didn’t waste time. You gained loads of XP. You will be better for next time.
10. Once you make it to the second date, you literally killed the first boss. You’re on your own now… Second dates will either make it to the third which no uninterested girl will do, or you will realise that this isn’t going to work - you will come to that realisation yourself, which is empowering.

*Why my dog’s behaviour is off putting:*
First off when I woke up and went out of my room my dog didn’t come jumping to greet me like he usually does, so I went to the living room to find him on the couch and he only wigged his tail a little upon seeing me, waiting for me to come to him. I didn’t think much of it, it happened a few times before when he didn’t hear me coming out. I went out with him in the yard. He was just standing there looking at me and didnt want to go potty or anything. He kept squinting his eyes at me and im not sure if its because the sky is light or he was giving me the peaceful dog look (its a dog body language thing). Either way after staring like that multiple times he barked and i got so startled because of how weird he was looking at me (which he does from time to time, yk like pooping but never like this) and i spilled my coffee on myself. Then he just continued staring at me like that and barking once per half a minute. When we came back home he started acting really weird like he didnt really know how to act? I dont know it seemed almost way too human, as if when I’m a someone’s house for the first time, and then he went into my room, which he rarely ever goes to unless its evening, and laid on my bed in a pose which is not relaxed at all. Just like on his fours. When i came in he seemed almost uncomfortable that i came in to check on him. So i talked a bit and petted him and then went to the other corner of the same room to check my phone. While i was doing that i tried to observe him without directly watching him. He sat up and kept sitting just weirdly, and then he switched to the end of the bed and laid down, again not like a dog but on all his fours like a cat or something. Im really weirded out this never happened before. Then i came to him to pet him after a few minutes and he seemed just stiff, and in the end avoided my touch slightly. I went to open up treats box so he came out of the room and acted like himself again for a few brief moments. I went and closed the door of the room because it freaked me out. 

*Right now:*
I’m in a living room sitting on an armchair while he’s on the sofa. He has been glued to the window watching the yard, which he does often when he’s bored but not for this long and this freaking sad. He looks like a freaking 90 year old reminiscing about his life! 

*Why I think my landlord has something to do with this:*
She loves our dog. Adores him. For past few years she has come often just to take him out for a walk. She’s old so we don’t think much of it. They’ve been here this past week fixing something in the yard, and the dog has been out with her often. Thing is he is a extremely attached to her, he whines when he hears her car coming and always wants to be with her when she’s here. She gives him treats and is a nice old lady i mean who wouldn’t get attached?
The reason I think this is not just some dog attachment is because I talked to her before, and I know she is into stuff like this. She has been to some schools when she was younger about some metal bending I’m not sure, and said to me once how my dog has extremely strong energy and is spiritually something, I didn’t really understand what she tried to say. 
Another thing to me that is weird is because I know my dog, I’ve had him for almost a decade now, he’s a very friendly dog and has made friends with our neighbours anywhere we go, developing deep bonds with a special few and he has never ever acted sad or grieved because of them. Only happy when they show up. We’ve moved a couple times so that’s why I know how he bonds and attaches to people.

To round up, it could be health issues I’ve searched it up but he acts completely normal when I say “treat” for example, like he’s him again. And then the next second he’s just there on the floor again staring up at me, almost acting shy or unsure of what to do. I’m not sure. This is some of the things I’ve observed so far, its been about 5 hours. 
I had some incense lying around so i burned one white sage and opened my windows, but I’m not the greatest when it comes to these types of situations. I don’t know what else to do.

Now that I'm a writer, too, I've realized I do my best work when in a similar setting. I haven't specifically tried a coffee shop yet, but out of all the places I write (different rooms of my home, my break room at work, my public library), the more public they are, the higher my word count and subjective quality in a given amount of time, with the library getting me the best results.

Is there a known scientific reason for this phenomenon? I know I can't be the only one, going by the stereotype. Have you experienced it yourself?

1lwafiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cork/comments/1lwafiq/paper_boys_service/,Paper boys service.,"Hi 
Wondering if we had a bad day visiting or if this is what other people experience.

We were in Cork recently and met friends for food in Paper Boys after seeing a lot of hype and good reviews on social media and word of mouth. 

We got there around half 11ish and was told there was a high table inside or a lot of space outside, so made our way outside. Spent about 10-15 minutes chatting, looking at the menu etc. and then went in to order.

Stood at the counter (we had been told to order here) while the staff just kind of looked at us, eventually one person came up and asked ""are you ok"".

Told them we would like to order and they said oh just a minute and walked off and never returned. 

A second person then came up and asked if we were ok and we said we would like to order our food. That person also said oh just a minute and walked away.

Eventually a 3rd person gets to the counter and asks if we are ok, and we say again we would like to order our food (about 5+ minutes have passed by this time) and they say oh I'll have to check and then turns to a guy at the coffee machine, who had been there and witness us ask the other two people if we can order, and then turns back to us and tells us ""oh it will be 15 minutes before we can take your order"" asked if we can order and just wait 15 more minutes but told they are not taking orders for 15 minutes.

So we go back outside and sit in the Sun and start counting down the 15 minutes.

We notice someone from a table going in with a menu after about 5 minutes, and then come back out with a buzzer for their food, so no issues taking their order. 

Then a second table go in, and seem to order with no issues as they come back with the buzzer.

We finally go in after 10 minutes and there is already a line of 3 people in front of us waiting to order.

So we stand in the queue while the others order (would be at least 5 tablet since we were told no orders) and when we get to the top the girl just says ""it will be at least 90 minutes until any food comes out is that ok"".

At this stage we've already been waiting 30 minutes just to place an order so my partner said to them we tried to order, was told no orders and then they took other peoples with no issues and he was just told ""well we are just busy"".

We ended up leaving andare telline them iy was ok, a two hour mininum wait for food wasn't for us and went to Dwyers which while not being the best food, they were happy to take our order and serve the food, all within about 20 minutes.

I'm a bit disappointed because i did hope this place from what I saw and heard and ended up very disappointed with the service. Was this just a bad day ornare they always like this?

American auto manufacturers are [preparing](https://www.theverge.com/news/680247/auto-manufacturing-halt-cars-china-rare-earth-minerals-magnets) to [shut down](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/06/25/why-auto-industry-anxiety-over-rare-earth-minerals-may-not-dissipate-any-time-soon) production lines. Defense manufacturers [may not be far behind](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/chinas-rare-earth-squeeze-puts-defense-giants-in-the-crosshairs.html). The tit-for-tat tariff escalation between the United States and China dominated headlines throughout March and April, but the real escalation happened quietly. On April 4, Beijing [restricted exports](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions) of seven rare earth elements and rare earth permanent magnets — key components in everything from automatic transmissions to missiles.

China [dominates](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/Neodymium%20Magnets%20Supply%20Chain%20Report%20-%20Final.pdf) the rare earth refining and magnet production processes, so the export restrictions jeopardize America’s ability to manufacture almost anything with moving parts.

Military platforms are just as vulnerable. Beijing [banned exports of antimony, gallium, and germanium](https://www.csis.org/analysis/china-imposes-its-most-stringent-critical-minerals-export-restrictions-yet-amidst) in December 2024, so rare earths are just the Chinese Communist Party’s latest move in a calculated escalation.

The rare earths export restriction became the focal point of negotiations between the American and Chinese delegations in both [Geneva](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/u-s-china-trade-truce-risks-falling-apart-over-rare-earth-exports-c36ceb72?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAiaEDDDHqYnM2F8Ql7MxhbJyFO5eQqaKAhb6E-2hjmYvZw3Va86DQBe&gaa_ts=6855653c&gaa_sig=aa3qsV3nhVMxLd1-81Dm5SR9TdKqPqA8JWbIxK4JtoJjMNr9YXl9md_ePnYzZOfRuoTDv5WYKa7uBvIfmZXSfA%3D%3D) and [London](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/us-seeks-deal-in-london-on-china-rare-earth-flows-says-trumps-economic-advisor), yet [Beijing continues to restrict these exports](https://www.investors.com/news/us-china-trade-rare-earths-lockheed-martin-f35-mp-materials/) and has shown little interest in giving up its primary source of leverage.

The United States is now in a race against time. As China deploys a meticulously prepared arsenal of economic weapons, the U.S. government should urgently reform and empower the agencies capable of moving strategic capital, especially the International Development Finance Corporation. Otherwise, the country risks widespread industrial shutdowns just as its defense leaders are warning that [an invasion of Taiwan may be imminent](https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/05/31/there-is-an-imminent-threat-to-taiwan-america-warns).

As the founder of an advisory firm focused on supply chain issues, I have a commercial interest in this topic and a rather unique view of the issues involved. Hopefully, this article will make clear that much of the world has a stake in this issue’s resolution.

**The Strategic Context**

The Chinese Communist Party is said to plan in decades while the U.S. government plans in four-year cycles. That framing gives Washington a rather convenient excuse for strategic surprise. However, Beijing [began developing its critical minerals dominance strategy in the 1990s](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2020/1127/ofr20201127.pdf) and ramped up its infrastructure campaign in the 2000s.

It worked. While American investors chased yield in low-risk, high-liquidity markets, the Chinese Communist Party gradually increased its influence over key aspects of the world’s [mineral supply](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2020/1127/ofr20201127.pdf), [telecommunications](https://www.jhuapl.edu/assessing-us-china-technology-connections/dist/b1f6868fa237afaad6fd044db86f7d86.pdf), and [physical](https://homeland.house.gov/2024/09/16/what-they-are-saying-joint-investigation-finds-potential-chinese-espionage-threats-to-u-s-ports/) [logistics](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/USTRReportChinaTargetingMaritime.pdf). It used [subsidies, concessionary lending, and market manipulation](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/reports/2025/2024USTRReportCongressonChinaWTOCompliance.pdf) to establish de facto control over multiple industries. Now it’s using that control to squeeze the United States and its allies.

Take natural graphite. It’s essential for lithium-ion batteries, but China refines about 99 percent of the world’s supply. After years of delays, the Development Finance Corporation [extended a loan to Syrah’s graphite mine in Mozambique](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/syrah-resources-150m-loan-waiver-balama-graphite-mine/) in late 2024. [Syrah declared *force majeure*](https://warontherocks.com/2025/04/mozambiques-quiet-threat-to-regional-stability-and-u-s-interests/) and halted graphite production soon after. According to public reports, [local protests in northern Mozambique escalated](https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241212/pdf/06ckdkktx9xnqz.pdf) due to contested national elections. I’ve been to the region and that explanation is unconvincing. The mine had operated peacefully for years and the protests erupted [just as China restricted natural graphite exports](https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3289148/china-restrict-exports-critical-minerals-us-commerce-ministry-says) to the United States. [The only other graphite mine in the region](https://aimnews.org/2023/09/19/graphite-mine-to-be-operated-in-niassa/), which happens to be operated by a Chinese company, is just up the road.

Or consider vanadium, [which is essential to aerospace-grade steel and titanium alloys](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-vanadium.pdf). Without it, an F-35 becomes a $100 million paperweight. The same goes for rockets and hypersonic missiles. After a wave of bankruptcies and acquisitions, Chinese and Russian firms now control [75 percent of the world’s vanadium supply](https://usvanadium.com/arkansas-leaders-urge-pentagon-to-immediately-purchase-vanadium-for-the-national-defense-stockpiles/). Glencore’s [Rhovan](https://www.bushveldminerals.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/BMN_01_20230810_Initiation.pdf) mine in South Africa and [Largo](https://s29.q4cdn.com/562286712/files/doc_presentation/2025/Largo_CorporatePresentation_Apr25.pdf) are the only Western-aligned, vertically integrated producers of aerospace-grade vanadium pentoxide. Chinese firms have flooded the market to suppress prices and squeeze both operations. [Issues plague Rhovan](https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/communities-call-on-government-to-intervene-in-glencore-dispute/), and [Largo is struggling](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001400438/eb9b58c7-ea3d-4d6a-8fad-b5a57b632256.pdf). The [Defense Logistics Agency hasn’t begun to stockpile it](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/05/28/tech-metals/ark-lawmakers-call-for-vanadium-stockpile/2295.html). Without intervention, the West may soon lose access.

**Markets Can’t Fix This**

Some argue [the market will respond](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-04-29/critical-minerals-are-a-us-headache-not-an-emergency), but markets fail when a dominant player prioritizes geopolitical leverage over profit. Beijing has demonstrated its willingness to incur any level of debt to dominate strategic sectors. The Export-Import Bank of China isn’t chasing quarterly returns. It is executing long-term state strategy. American mining, construction, energy, logistics, telecommunications, and financial firms have little incentive to work together overseas, but the Chinese government regularly directs dozens of state-owned enterprises to execute sprawling projects.

Domestic mining will be essential to resolve America’s mineral supply chain vulnerabilities, but it will take years to develop adequate domestic human capital. Most new mines will reach production in the mid-2030s, even with fast-tracked permits. For near-term solutions, the country needs to invest abroad.

The United States and its close allies have some of the world’s largest and most liquid financial markets, but virtually none of that capital supports project finance in emerging and frontier markets. This is partly because Western investors are relatively unadventurous — American private equity associates do not travel to rural Zambia in search of good mining investments, but their Chinese counterparts do so regularly.

That said, investors are rightly hesitant since such projects rarely provide adequate risk-adjusted returns. A private equity manager in the United States typically targets 15 percent annualized returns in a jurisdiction with strong rule of law, stable regulations, and plentiful exit opportunities. Or they can deploy capital into a 20-year mining project in a developing country with questionable rule of law, significant reputational risk, high regulatory uncertainty, and minimal exit opportunities, knowing a hostile superpower will work to ensure the mine never turns a profit — for roughly the same projected returns *if* *everything goes right*.

Investors will only commit capital if they receive sufficient financial support from the U.S. government — and almost everyone agrees that governments ought to address market failures that jeopardize national security. But this is not happening.

**The Missing Link: The Development Finance Corporation**

I arrived in Washington a year ago thinking that, with critical minerals white papers surfacing every week, solutions were surely in the works. I was wrong. Aside from the Syrah Resources deal mentioned above, the U.S. government has committed virtually no capital toward overseas projects with a clear national security objective.

First, a quick tour of the institutions that could deploy strategic capital. The Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office [was only authorized to support domestic projects](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/loan-programs-office). The Department of Defense can [support defense-related projects under Title III of the Defense Production Act](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?edition=prelim&path=%2Fprelim%40title50%2Fchapter55#:~:text=For%20purposes%20of%20subchapter,the%20United%20Kingdom%3B%20and), yet those authorities only apply to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia — places where Western investors are already comfortable.

The Export-Import Bank can deploy capital worldwide, but it is too [constrained, risk-averse, and under-resourced](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-exim-bank-age-great-power-competition) to be effective. It primarily [underwrites and insures](https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IF/PDF/IF10017/IF10017.32.pdf) U.S. goods and services exports, such as the American labor and U.S.-made machinery to build an overseas mine. The “U.S. content” in such projects is typically minimal, so the bank buys down almost no risk in practice — even with mildly helpful programs like the [China and Transformational Exports Program](https://www.exim.gov/about/special-initiatives/ctep) and the forthcoming [Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative](https://www.exim.gov/about/special-initiatives/supply-chain-resiliency-initiative). The bank also faces an immediate [lending cap freeze](https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IF/PDF/IF10017/IF10017.32.pdf) if its default rate reaches 2 percent — an extreme level of risk aversion that effectively rules out any strategic competition role.

That leaves the Development Finance Corporation, created by the [2018 BUILD Act](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R45461.pdf). The first Trump administration sought to use the agency as a counterweight to the Belt and Road Initiative, aiming to [catalyze private investments and lending](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R45461.pdf#:~:text=A%20key%20policy%20rationale%20for,savings%20through%20consolidation) in emerging markets while advancing U.S. foreign policy. Yet most [observers](https://www.csis.org/analysis/next-five-years-dfc-ten-recommendations-revamp-agency) of the Development Finance Corporation agree that [it is too small, heavily constrained, and excruciatingly slow](https://www.cfr.org/article/reauthorizing-dfc-primer-policymakers). Its $60 billion portfolio cap limits new investments to a few billion dollars annually. Deals often languish in the pipeline for more than a year. Meanwhile, Chinese investors often make high-stakes decisions in a matter of weeks.

The agency suffers from severely constrained deal flow. Foreign governments and private sector investors were wary of working with a relatively new, small, unresponsive, and risk-averse institution even before the Biden administration [diverted it from its strategic mandate](https://www.dfc.gov/sites/default/files/media/documents/DFC_AnnualReport_2024_final_508.pdf). For years, projects have had to meet sweeping environmental, social, governance and diversity, equity, and inclusion criteria, which diluted national security outcomes. The “2024 Investment Activities” section of the agency’s [2024 Annual Report](https://www.dfc.gov/sites/default/files/media/documents/DFC_AnnualReport_2024_final_508.pdf) shows the rather unfortunate results. Meanwhile, Chinese investors offered far more money with no strings attached.

In summary, America’s top geopolitical adversary is executing a whole-of-government strategy to entrench global dominance over the supply chains that underpin Western economies and warfighting capacity. It’s already cutting off access to critical materials. The U.S. government has just one agency authorized to respond with capital. And it’s not functioning.

**How to Fix It**

This issue is solvable if the Trump administration makes it a priority, and there are hopeful signs. Trump has nominated Ben Black to lead the Development Finance Corporation. He co-authored a [widely shared article with Joe Lonsdale](https://blog.joelonsdale.com/p/how-to-doge-us-foreign-aid) in January calling for more purposeful capital deployment abroad. However, the agency remains under a hiring freeze, after having lost much of its key staff, and it will need comprehensive reforms.

First, clarify the mission. The Development Finance Corporation exists to advance U.S. interests in contested markets via strategic capital deployment. The agency is uniquely situated to do this, and development may form part of the strategy. It seems likely that Congress will [address the agency’s mission](https://youngkim.house.gov/2025/03/11/rep-young-kim-we-must-ensure-dfc-is-equipped-to-face-21st-century-challenges-with-cutting-edge-approaches/) and a [range of other administrative issues](https://www.cfr.org/article/reauthorizing-dfc-primer-policymakers) during the reauthorization process later this year.

Second, wire the agency into the national security architecture. The National Security Council as well as the Departments of Defense, State, Commerce, and Treasury view the world through different lenses. The Development Finance Corporation can become the financial engine for their collective priorities. That requires intelligence inputs, interagency coordination, and a real-time common operating picture. Then use interagency resources to ensure investments succeed.

Third, redesign for speed. No deal should take more than 90 days to approve or reject. Priority projects should close within 30 days. That means building a mission-oriented staff with private sector experience and security clearances. It means leveraging on-premises AI to speed up rote tasks. And it means adopting a crisis posture — focused, streamlined, and urgent. None of this is possible while the agency remains under a hiring freeze.

Fourth, build a high-quality deal pipeline. Inbound deals must meet clear screening criteria — built and maintained with interagency input — so the agency can focus its limited resources. The agency will never match China’s scale dollar-for-dollar so it must punch above its weight by focusing on projects that are clearly critical to national security. Its personnel must begin to aggressively source relevant deals from industry, investors, U.S. embassies, other agencies, and foreign governments.

Finally, embrace risk. The agency’s risk aversion slows it down and constrains its deal flow. Congress should change the current equity scoring system, which effectively counts the agency’s equity investments as grants — in other words, as a total loss. A more sensible accounting system will free up many billions of dollars for equity investment. This is important since investing at the bottom of the capital stack means the U.S. government will take first loss if a project underperforms. That provides a financial buffer for private investors, who also feel more comfortable when they co-invest with the world’s most powerful government. The agency can also learn from its Chinese competitors and adopt a venture capital approach to early-stage mining investments with strategic potential.

**The False Choice of “Domestic Versus Overseas”**

Critics argue that taxpayer dollars shouldn’t fund risky projects in foreign countries. That argument misses the point. The U.S. economy — and its defense industrial base — depends on inputs from abroad. No level of protectionism can change that overnight. The United States either secures those inputs or leaves them vulnerable to adversaries.

Targeted investments can safeguard entire industries for a fraction of what the U.S. government spends on defense each year. Some will lose money. Many won’t. But even if they do, they will protect far greater value here at home. That’s not aid. It’s strategic insurance.

The United States is in a contest for control over the systems that make modern life possible — energy, transportation, semiconductors, and communications. China is acting accordingly. If the U.S. government wants to win, it needs to bring its most potent investment tool back into the fight.

# JULY 9th, 2025~Impacts of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on the Mining Sector

[Impacts of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on the Mining Sector](https://www.csis.org/analysis/impacts-one-big-beautiful-act-mining-sector)

https://preview.redd.it/lb6eb30t71cf1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6462d8bd8f6f8894201c441795e3cfa6fd6d81a

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed H.R.1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), into law. The sweeping legislation enacts major changes across tax and fiscal policy, social safety-net and healthcare programs, and immigration and border enforcement. Notably, it includes substantial revisions to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), rolling back several programs with lasting implications for the energy sector and critical mineral supply chains. While the bill aims to accelerate domestic sourcing of critical minerals and reduce U.S. dependence on China, it simultaneously eliminates key IRA incentives that have been driving downstream demand—introducing new complexities for making long-term minerals investments and reshaping critical mineral supply chains long dominated by Beijing.

**Q1: Which critical minerals–related IRA provisions are affected by the OBBBA, and what does this mean for critical mineral producers?**

**A1:** The OBBBA targets several IRA-era tax credit programs introduced under the Biden administration to encourage investment in U.S.-based clean energy supply chains and the critical minerals essential to domestic manufacturing. These revisions reflect the Trump administration’s broader shift away from prioritizing the energy transition and the expansion of renewable technologies and electric mobility.

* **Eliminates Section 30D Clean Vehicle Credit**   The OBBBA terminates the Section 30D Clean Vehicle Credit at the end of the current fiscal year. This $7,500 incentive was intended to drive investment in the United States and countries it has a free trade agreement (FTA) by incentivizing the purchase of electric vehicles (EVs) that rely on minerals sourced from these jurisdictions. Given that EVs are the largest commercial driver of critical mineral demand, the credit’s removal is likely to dampen both large-scale mineral demand and broader EV adoption.   Without this policy support and facing an uncertain demand outlook, automakers are less inclined to enter into long-term mineral offtake agreements—making it more difficult for domestic mining projects to attract investment. These headwinds are amplified by the current [price environment](https://www.csis.org/analysis/building-new-market-counter-chinese-mineral-market-manipulation): Between 2022 and 2025, cobalt prices dropped 60 percent, nickel by 73 percent, and lithium by 87 percent. In the absence of stable domestic demand, more projects may turn to China for financing and offtake. In 2024, Chinese mining acquisitions abroad surged to [their highest levels in over a decade](https://www.ft.com/content/51c2016a-28f3-4600-9e08-a491410d34a9?shareType=nongift)—part of a broader push to secure control over the materials that power the global economy amid rising geopolitical tensions.   
* **Phases Out the Section 45X Tax Credit by 2033**   The OBBBA introduces major revisions to the Section 45X Production Tax Credit for critical mineral components. As outlined in CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program’s [November 2024 analysis](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-department-treasury-releases-final-ruling-section-45x), this credit offered a 10 percent incentive to taxpayers for costs associated with producing critical minerals to specified purity thresholds—including both extraction and materials processing expenses. Designed to boost domestic production of inputs essential to clean energy technologies, the credit was originally set to phase out by 2032 for most industries—except critical minerals, which were exempted to reflect the long timelines and capital challenges typical of mining projects. This indefinite extension was particularly important given the sector’s struggle to attract private investment amid falling commodity prices, prolonged permitting processes, and fierce competition from heavily subsidized Chinese producers.   The OBBBA eliminated this phaseout exemption for critical mineral components and imposes a phasedown with the credit dropping to 75 percent in 2031, 50 percent in 2032, and 25 percent in 2033 before ending on December 31, 2033. Now, only critical mineral projects that are operational before 2032 will access the full credit for a short number of years. Given the long timelines for developing new mines and ramping up production, the revisions to Section 45X will dampen the credit’s impact on the mining sector. Furthermore, the amended tax credit disincentivizes investment in newly discovered greenfield projects with longer timelines to production in favor of brownfield legacy mines that may be closer to production but have lower grade reserves.   

**Q2: How are Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules redefined, and how will critical mineral projects be impacted?**

**A2:** The OBBBA adopts a more stringent definition of FEOC, expanding the range of companies and actors that are disqualified from receiving benefits. These updated provisions are specifically designed to limit Chinese firms’ access to U.S. tax incentives by narrowing eligibility criteria and discouraging Chinese investment in U.S. critical mineral and energy projects.

The OBBBA establishes two new classifications of FEOCs. The first, Specified Foreign Entities (SFEs), seeks to unify previously fragmented definitions used across federal agencies into a single, comprehensive category. SFEs encompass Chinese military companies, battery manufacturers banned from Department of Defense contracts, entities listed by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, companies on the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act Entity List, and those identified in the William M. Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act 2021 FEOC list. The second classification, Foreign-Influenced Entities (FIEs), casts a wider net—covering any company significantly influenced through formal relationships or financial dependence on an SFE. A company qualifies as an FIE if an SFE appoints its executives or board members, holds a 25 percent or greater ownership stake, or has contractual rights to control production. Together, SFEs and FIEs form a broader category referred to in the legislation as Prohibited Foreign Entities (PFEs). PFEs are barred from accessing 45X production tax credits beginning in 2026.

Another FEOC change is related to [Section 45X(c)(6)](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-22-47.pdf). This provision outline 50 minerals—such as aluminum, cobalt, lithium, and nickel—that qualify as applicable critical minerals under the tax credit, provided they are processed or refined to specified purity levels. Under the OBBBA, the determination of whether a facility or energy storage technology benefits from “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity” is based on a new metric: the material assistance cost ratio. This ratio compares the total cost of all manufactured products used in the completed project—excluding those sourced from a PFE—against the total cost of all manufactured products incorporated into the project. A facility complies only if this ratio meets or exceeds the required threshold percentage.

The OBBBA also takes a mineral-by-mineral approach. It mandates that by December 31, 2027, the secretary of the treasury should establish updated threshold percentages for each of the critical minerals listed in Section 45X(c). These new benchmarks will (a) replace the prior thresholds for each calendar year going forward and (b) must be equal to or higher than the earlier thresholds, taking into account how available the mineral is in the United States, current supply chain challenges, U.S. processing capacity, and national security considerations.

**Q3: Will new appropriations meaningfully increase critical mineral security?**

**A3:** Section 20004 of the OBBBA includes the following allocations for fiscal year 2025: $2 billion to the secretary of defense to boost the U.S. stockpile of critical minerals through the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund. The stockpile is a critical national security support [mechanism](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2025-02/250210_Baskaran_Critical_Minerals.pdf?VersionId=Tfu2TnNrQGlN7ol8HSCakMUT8HTwYukd). In the event of a natural disaster, regional conflict, or major war, government-owned mineral stockpiles can supply the U.S. military and critical industries with the materials necessary to support national defense. The OBBBA provides an additional $5 billion—available through September 30, 2029—for investments in critical mineral supply chains via the Industrial Base Fund under Title 10, U.S. Code.

While these allocations represent meaningful supply-side support, the OBBBA does not deliver on demand-side measures needed to drive sustained market demand from key sectors, defense, semiconductors, and energy.

**Q4: Can downstream demand for critical minerals be stimulated without IRA clean energy incentives?**

**A4:** Possibly—but it will require a new and sustained demand signal. The United States must establish a broad, cross-sector incentives strategy that promotes sustained demand for critical mineral production and processing for off-take in defense, semiconductors, automotive, and energy. While past efforts, such as the CHIPS and Science Act, have bolstered domestic semiconductor manufacturing, they failed to include any provisions to source upstream mineral inputs essential to chip fabrication. Similarly, the IRA introduced valuable incentives for critical mineral production, but its benefits were limited to projects within the United States or countries with which it has FTAs. This narrow scope excluded many mineral-rich nations, limiting both the number of vehicles eligible for the tax credit and the total policy impact. The Defense Production Act is also a supply-side intervention.

Today, U.S.-based mineral projects face mounting challenges: falling commodity prices, high operating costs, and aggressive competition from Chinese firms. Chinese producers often benefit from low-cost labor and energy, deep state subsidies, and government-backed market interventions. As a result, many Western projects are no longer economically viable and are operating at a loss—deterring private investment not only in the United States but also in partner countries.

Strategic incentives can help reverse this trend. By offering production tax credits and subsidies, these incentives reduce investment risk and improve the competitiveness of Western mining and processing ventures. To ensure long-term supply chain security, these packages must go beyond EV battery minerals to include those critical to advanced technologies, such as gallium and germanium for semiconductors. Targeted tax credits for midstream mineral processing—both domestically and in key allied nations—will be essential to getting these complex, capital-intensive projects off the ground.

**Q5: Which countries should be eligible for future U.S. mineral incentives?**

**A5:** There is a need to widen the list of eligible countries for minerals production and processing incentives. Critical mineral reserves do not align neatly with the boundaries of U.S. FTAs, which limited the effectiveness of the IRA’s sourcing requirements. For instance, Morocco—the only African nation with a U.S. FTA—has minimal mineral reserves, while much of the rest of the continent holds vast deposits of copper, cobalt, lithium, nickel, graphite, rare earth elements, platinum group metals, manganese, and chrome. Yet, these resource-rich countries were excluded from IRA benefits. This disconnect between where minerals are located and where U.S. trade agreements exist meant that North American automakers faced significant challenges in sourcing eligible minerals—ultimately resulting in only a small number of EV models qualifying for the credit and undermining the overall impact of the policy.

Expanding the pool of eligible countries for mineral-related incentives represents a strategic lever for strengthening U.S. minerals diplomacy and advancing long-term supply chain security. By broadening eligibility beyond the narrow confines of existing FTAs, the United States can create meaningful incentives for resource-rich nations to align their critical minerals exports with U.S. and allied markets, rather than defaulting to Chinese offtake arrangements.

If you apply the basic equation for calculating ones *Intelligence Quotient* you come to the conclusion that T\*RFs who try the whole ""your bones says you're a man!"" thing are probably close to ""Severely Mentally Retarded"". They make me laugh, they make me feel pity towards them, but they don't make me feel shame that someone could just look me up on the Internet and discover I spent $34,574 on medical related expenses to have my deek inverted.",1,1752146957.0,terf_trans_fight,0,1.0,False

Then I'd use the DEI, and also the EIC (investment rights in the UK) as places to invest in for my companies. Big problem: you can only establish a the plantation company with 5 plantations. Okay then, I conquer Brunei, establish the company there. I thought I'd be cheeky, by then giving North Borneo to the DEI, thinking the HQ will just transfer to another state. Nope, company HQ remains in North Borneo, owned by company 'doesn't exist' (and turns it into the pink pig face thing).

  
Is it just impossible to play like this? As the states in the Low Countries don't have any options for say Sugar or Coffee. This also renders it impossible to get the prestige good variant, as you need to be in the top 3 producers. Even if you own all the coffee plantations in the world, the game considers them as not yours, as they are located in other countries.",2,1752146940.0,victoria3,0,1.0,False

But for a long time, the noise — the competition, the fear, the pressure to be perfect — kept me frozen. I’d think, “There are already so many doing this. Why would mine matter?”

Then something shifted. I said to myself, “Screw it. I’m going to build this. I may not have all the answers, but I have the vision, the willingness to learn, and the guts to try.”

And here I am.

I’m building something in the fintech space — it’s a personal project that’s been on my mind for sometime. I’m solo right now, not a developer by trade, but I’m learning, testing, and prototyping as I go. And honestly, I’ve never felt more alive.

I don’t know where this journey will take me. Maybe it flops. Maybe it changes my life. But for once, I’m not watching from the sidelines — I’m in the game. And that feeling alone makes it worth it.

Right now, I’m in the early validation phase, building out the app (with a lot of developer tools and lots of coffee), and testing ideas with a small group I trust. I’d love to find others to collaborate with — developers, builders, tinkerers, dreamers — people who love the journey more than the paycheck (for now), and want their name on something that could matter. If this ever gets funded, equity is on the table — but right now, it’s just heart and hustle.

Also — if you’re in Houston, TX — I’m hunting for good incubators, events, or spaces where people like me gather. I could Google, sure — but I’d rather hear from people who’ve lived it.

Thanks for reading. Seriously. To every small business owner, solo founder, late bloomer, or startup junkie — I’m rooting for you. Let’s build something meaningful.

I needed a place to vent and hopefully find some support or ideas. I've been working for 4 years now, and sadly, I’ve never had real friends at work. For the first 3 years, I was in a different department, and though I tried being friendly, nothing ever clicked. I kept thinking – maybe it’s the people or the environment.

Last year, I shifted to a new department, hoping for a fresh start. I made genuine efforts – I smiled, joined in small conversations, tried to be supportive, initiated chats, and even invited a few for coffee - but still, no meaningful connections. People here already seem to have their groups, their “office besties,” and I feel like an outsider trying hard to fit in.

What hurts most is not having someone at work to go on tea breaks with, laugh over silly stuff, rant to during stressful moments, or even share a simple lunch with. I’m not saying I need a whole gang – just one or two real friends who get me.

Today I felt especially terrible. I saw others bonding, laughing, planning weekend hangouts… and I was just there, invisible. I know I’m not boring or difficult – outside of work, I’m quite cheerful and talkative. But this loneliness at work is eating me up. I want to break this feeling, not just by fitting in at work, but maybe by making friends elsewhere, outside the office.

If anyone here is from Mysuru, can you recommend apps or groups where people make new friends? Be it for a coffee, a walk in the park, a book club, movie nights, or even just casual stress relief chit-chat. Anything where I can connect with kind, like-minded people and stop feeling so alone. I want to show myself (and maybe even my colleagues) that I don’t need to be part of their group to be happy or fulfilled.

Also, if you’ve ever felt like this, how did *you* deal with it?

Thanks for reading. Just typing this out already makes me feel a little lighter.

I usually put the grounds in the filter up to roughly the 1.5L line, and then begin pouring water over the beans until the water is at the top of the jug. This results in nearly exactly 1.5L of coffee. But this process takes forever.

So I thought I'd try pouring the water into the jug first and slowly insert the filter into the jug. I topped off the water as it was only slightly low. Probably about 20mL.

I let it steep in the fridge for about 19 hours.

But I think I may have not used enough grounds and I wonder if there's a way to save it.

It definitely tastes light.

Would I be able to put new grounds in the filter and steep it overnight to make it a bit stronger? Not full, just a couple scoops.

No, it’s not magic. And no, it doesn’t involve $40 green powders. Just a few consistent habits that make a big difference 👇

 **5-Part Morning Immunity Routine:**

1. **Lukewarm water + lemon (before coffee)** Helps with hydration and gives a gentle kick of vitamin C. Plus, my digestion seems to appreciate it.
2. **15–20 minutes of sunlight or daylight** Natural light in the morning helps regulate circadian rhythm — which supports immune balance, better sleep, and lower stress levels.
3. **Movement: Stretch, walk, or yoga flow** Nothing intense — just something to get blood moving. Movement helps lymph flow (which supports immune defense).
4. **Cold rinse at the end of my shower** I know it sounds dramatic, but a 30-second cold blast at the end of my shower helps wake me up *and* stimulates circulation.
5. **Quick breakfast with protein + probiotic** I keep it simple: eggs or Greek yogurt + berries or banana. Gut health = immune health, and consistency is key.

I’m not saying this routine makes me invincible. But since doing this regularly, I’ve noticed fewer colds, more energy, and better recovery when I *do* feel off.

1lwa4ub,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1lwa4ub/how_i_suppose_to_continue_after_knowing_this/,How I suppose to continue after knowing this?,"I'm currently at a crossroads, and honestly, I don't know what to do or how to move forward with my life. I know it might not sound like a huge deal, but maybe hearing other people's opinions will help me figure out a way to lose as little as possible in the process.

First off, I apologize in advance because this story might be a bit long. To give you some context, my family has always been small. I grew up with my brother and my father. My dad was married to my brother's mom, but from what I understand, she left him and never came back. My father never spoke badly about her. Years later, he met my mother, but unfortunately, she passed away when I was only 3 years old, so I don't remember her very well. My brother, who I've always called and loved like a true brother, is 7 years older than me. I know he was very close with my mother, and her passing really hurt him. My father always taught us to be brothers, and I always looked up to my older brother, like any younger sibling would. I have no complaints about our time together; he always treated me well. Even though my dad worked a lot, he always came to all my school events and special days.

However, all this changed when my brother met his current wife. She comes from a very religious (Catholic) family, and from the start, she tried to impose her values on my family. Since we saw how happy my brother was, we went along with everything, even though my dad and I would complain when we found certain things ridiculous. For example, when she visited, she always made us pray before eating. With me, she was always lecturing me about everything, especially that I had to stay away from girls until I was of legal age and promised not to commit any sinful acts. I always just nodded because I didn't want my brother to have problems with her later.

For my brother's engagement party, we were invited for a weekend to his future wife's relative's house. The first thing they told us was that all the single young people had to sleep in separate wings to avoid any misunderstandings. This was because it was an old house and there were only shared bathrooms in each wing. I didn't really care, but my brother joked about it since he still had to wait until the wedding to sleep with his wife, which I knew was tough for him and why he was rushing the whole process. On that trip, I met Lucilla, a cousin of my sister-in-law, who was my age. She was a beautiful, stunning young woman, and I was immediately smitten. I tried to get closer to her, talk to her, and it seemed like everything was going well. She was also very religious, to the point that she politely refused any invitation to walk alone with me; there always had to be someone else. I even found it sweet; I might have been falling in love, which I was completely fine with. That same night, when I went to sleep in the small, windowless guest room I'd been assigned, I couldn't stop thinking about trying to get closer to her the next day.

After finally falling asleep, I don't know what time it was, someone entered my room in complete darkness. Before I could say anything, they jumped on me and whispered in my ear to keep quiet. I'm going to be honest, it was my first time with a woman so close, so I was completely stunned and just nodded. The image of sweet Lucilla popped into my mind, showing me a secret side. Before I could do anything, she handcuffed me and did what she wanted with me. Without going into details, since that was my first experience, I have to say it left a marked impression on me. In the end, she simply unleashed me and disappeared.

The next day, I barely saw her, feeling completely ashamed. I tried to hint at how good the previous night was, but she ignored me, saying she didn't understand what I was referring to. I was a bit put off, but I thought she was just trying to maintain her ""innocent"" facade. The second night, it happened again, which I was really looking forward to. Again, she tied me up, and when I tried to whisper her name, Lucilla, she immediately covered my mouth with her hand. Again, she left as quickly as she arrived. Then, as I was relaxing later, it hit me for the first time that we'd done it without protection, so I panicked. I didn't know if she'd taken care of it or something, but my mind immediately thought she could get pregnant. The next day, I tried to talk to her more directly, but my sister-in-law kept interrupting me. Before I could, they told me she had already left. I spoke to my sister-in-law to ask for Lucilla's phone number, but she very rudely refused to give it to me, only agreeing to give her mine. For the following weeks, I waited for her call, asking my sister-in-law if she had talked to her, which she always said no to.

One day, without any prior notice, my brother and sister-in-law told us they had gotten married in a surprise ceremony, without a party, completely behind everyone's backs. Both families were bewildered, as she had always talked about a big ceremony in the city's cathedral. According to her, it was a romantic gesture from my brother, that she ""could no longer resist being his wife."" My father and I questioned my brother, who told us that she had cornered him, saying she wanted to be with him so badly and consummate their love, that she was willing to marry immediately. Since he was so tired of waiting, he didn't think twice. The news that she was expecting my nephew came a week later, and the family threw a party to celebrate both the marriage and the pregnancy. I took the opportunity to look for Lucilla, but I couldn't find her. When I asked my sister-in-law, I only received aggressive-passive answers, telling me not to be so selfish and to celebrate the good news, that I was going to be an uncle and that I needed to start being a good example.

The coming months were quite demanding. My 23-year-old brother was finishing his university degree and looking for a job to support his new family. He demanded my help, accompanying his pregnant wife to the doctor or going to buy things for her. Since I've always loved my brother and was only in high school at the time, I didn't complain and did my best. This took a toll on my social life, as all my free time had to be dedicated to buying things or assembling furniture for the future baby. My friends at the time told me I should refuse, that my brother would take advantage, but my father always taught us to help each other when needed, and I saw my brother so happy that I couldn't refuse. My nephew was born healthy, and the look of happiness on my father's and brother's faces when they saw him that day made all the effort worth it. For economic reasons, my brother, his wife, and son started living with us, since the house was my father's and was supposedly big enough for everyone.

The little free time I had became time spent taking care of my nephew. While I didn't dislike spending time with him, as a young man, I wanted time to be with my friends or even meet a girl. When I talked about this with my brother and sister-in-law, at first they understood. But once I mentioned needing time to meet someone, she got upset, telling me I was too young to think about that and that I should only focus on my studies. I talked to my father, who told me they were only worried about my well-being and that if I behaved well, everything would be fine.

I continued with my life, and at 16, I met a girl, Ana, with whom I started secretly seeing after school, away from my family. One day, my sister-in-law saw us at a coffee shop near school. She immediately came over to talk about how it was possible for me to be with girls without their permission. When Ana tried to tell her we were just talking, my sister-in-law responded in the worst possible way, saying Ana didn't need to come and say things. Needless to say, that was the last time I saw Ana. After this, I had a few more problems with my sister-in-law, which always ended in the same cycle: she would cry to my brother, he would scold me, and then she would start being softer with me, telling me she only wanted the best for me and that I should see her as the mother she is if I needed to talk about anything. At every social event, she cut off any possible interaction I had with girls, almost as if she were my mother.

Once I turned 18, I just wanted to go to a university with dorms so I could have some independence. I was accepted and even received a scholarship **par excellence**, which also covered my dorm stay. My sister-in-law and brother vehemently opposed this, arguing that living alone would only lead me to a life of sin and excess. I won't deny that it was tempting, given how much repression I felt. However, I wanted to show them they were wrong. My father intervened and made me promise that I would behave and make the most of this opportunity. I didn't want to disappoint him, so he supported me, and I left home.

I must admit that after a month or two, my sister-in-law started calling me periodically to ask how I was and if I was having a hard time being there. I noticed her concern in her voice, and that made me feel good. There were times she still lectured me about girls, and I pretended I wasn't doing anything like that. I just told her, ""Yeah, I won't do it,"" and laughed happily. I must admit that even though I had opportunities, I wanted to show them I could keep my word and stayed away from parties, despite my roommates always inviting me. There were moments when girls approached me, but I said I preferred to focus on keeping my scholarship so my father would be proud.

Near the end of my degree, during a long holiday weekend, my sister-in-law showed up on my campus. She was dressed quite **jovially**, almost like another student. She told me she came to pick me up for a family celebration that she didn't want me to miss. When I asked her why she was dressed like that, she just said she didn't want my friends to think she was an ""aunt"" or some old lady in my life. I asked about my brother, and she told me he was already on his way to the place with my nephew, and that she had offered to pick me up so I didn't have to take the bus and could feel like family. I liked the idea, and this change felt good.

I went with her to the same place her family always used for celebrations. The conversation during the trip was pleasant and even entertaining, like talking with a sister about university, courses, professors, etc. When she asked me if there was a girl, I told her not really, but since we were going to see her family, I wanted to know what had become of her cousin Lucilla. She changed her tone, telling me she didn't know anything about her, but that I'd be better off staying away from her. I didn't want to ask more, since we had more driving to do, and I didn't want to ruin the atmosphere.

Upon arriving, I saw my brother and my nephew, who I hadn't seen in a few months. My nephew asked me to pick him up, and at that moment, I didn't let him go anymore. My brother was more mature, a complete father. I asked about our father, and my brother told me he didn't want to come because he had something to do. I told him that when we came back, I wanted to go with them to visit him.

That night, after the celebrations, I saw Lucilla, more beautiful than ever and, despite the years, my only experience of that kind. Despite what my sister-in-law told me, I couldn't contain myself and went to talk to her. At first, she didn't recognize me, but after talking a little, she remembered. When I asked her why she hadn't contacted me and things like that, keeping a casual tone, she told me she didn't understand why she should have. At that moment, my sister-in-law appeared, telling her cousin that an uncle was looking for her. When we were alone again, I asked her what that was all about, and she told me that her cousin wasn't ""right in the head"" and that I shouldn't talk to her anymore. At that moment, I believed her completely, which made me feel confused about my feelings and memories, that my experience had only been an episode where, in the background, someone took advantage of me. My sister-in-law saw my face and took me aside, telling me that if something happened in the past, I wasn't guilty, but **never, ever** tell anyone. At that time, everything related to the sexual world became a **taboo topic** for me, and I didn't want to approach anyone until I decided to go to therapy about it.

A short time later, a month after university ended, my father got sick. On his deathbed, he spoke to both my brother and me separately. When we talked, he told me that he thought he would leave the house to my brother, which I accepted without problem, and that he had left something for me in the bank's safe, and that only once he was gone, I would be able to get it. I told him I wasn't interested and he asked me to always be there for my brother and my nephew. I promised him that I would always be there for them. After my father's death, the bureaucratic part was simple; there was no discussion. My brother asked me if I agreed, and I told him without a doubt. I partly forgot about the bank, I received the key from my father's lawyer, and I left it in a drawer in my house.

A year later, my nephew became seriously ill. After many visits to different specialists, he was diagnosed with a severe case of **acute myeloid leukemia**, and the only possible solution to improve is a **bone marrow transplant**. My brother immediately offered to be a donor, but after the study, it turned out he wasn't compatible. Since my brother's insurance didn't cover this, he had to pay for the cost of the study. So when I offered to see if I could donate, he said not to, since we don't have the financial means at the moment, and since we're brothers, it's most likely that the result would be the same.

In all this despair, I spoke with a university friend who now works in a private genetic laboratory, asking if he could do me a favor and run a pre-study to see if it was worth paying for a conclusive study. After reviewing, he contacted me and told me to give him a sample of mine, since he apparently had a sample from my brother. I told him it was mine, to which he said it wasn't possible since he saw a direct connection, like a father and son. I didn't understand what was happening, and he recommended I do a paternity test, just to eliminate doubt. I don't know what happened in my mind when I accepted; maybe it was complete certainty that there was no way that could be the case, perhaps to tell my friend he needed to study more. The next day he called me to talk about the subject and told me it was positive. I told him that we are obviously related, he is my brother's son, to which he tells me that unless we are twins, there is no possibility of error. However, he recommended the study, since I might be a donor. Even though it still bothered me, my nephew's well-being was the priority, so I started the study. In a few weeks, I will have the results, but in the meantime, I don't know what to do. I know that if the results are positive, maybe my nephew can live a normal life, but I don't know what will happen between us. I'm scared; I have no more family and very few friends. I don't want to open my mouth, but this is weighing on me. If my brother starts to doubt and interrogate me, I don't know if I can stay silent. How and when it's clear, now I understand so much secrecy, obstructions, and other suspicious attitudes, but now is not the time. I'm afraid my brother will hate me and I'll lose the little I have. At the moment, only my friend knows about this, but I don't know how to handle it. Any advice is welcome. Thanks in advance.",1,1752146310.0,family,2,1.0,False

I geek out over [podcasts about aliens/80s rock/perfecting my pizza dough], and I will absolutely send you memes that make me snort-laugh. Bonus points if you can:  
- Recommend a killer playlist,  
- Teach me something random (I’m weirdly curious about [e.g., urban gardening/space facts]),  
- Or out-debate me on whether Die Hard is a Christmas movie (it is).  

Looking for someone who’s equal parts laid-back and up for deep chats over cheap wine. Let’s swap stories and see where the vibe takes us!  ",1,1752146126.0,u_Adequate_7289,0,1.0,False
1lwa2pn,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1lwa2pn/blocked_still/,Blocked Still?,"## Writer's Block? More Like Writer's *Bleh*. Let's Fix This:

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush. Now go forth and conquer that blank page! (And maybe wear a lampshade for good luck.)",1,1752146107.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

**Garbage collection**
For some reason I cannot get my trash picked up.   It’s now been 3 weeks, at least 4 phone calls to 311.   They put a work order in and then today call in to see what is going on and am told that at 1:15 our trash was finally picked up.  The problem is, the can is still sitting in the same place full.   I don’t understand when I’ve lived here for 10 years and pay my bill on time every single month.  

There has to be way to get this resolved.  The quality of service has went down hill drastically. 

Can someone please address this and get it fixed? It’s a super simple issue with a super simple fix.  They just need to empty the can on trash day.  It’s a green can with a lid, wheels, the bracket to use the auto lifter, and sits right next the the “issued” can.  I’ve had this can for at least 3 years and never had an issue until the last month.

**Traffic light/sign**
I live in the sharp curve on Judy Ln. in the past month, there have been 2 head-on collision, several regular crashes, multiple cars running into the guard rail and up into my yard. And, three weeks ago, a driver ran over my cat and killed him. They didn’t even stop to check him. There is a family with small kids on the other side and they came close to getting ran over one day too. We desperately need signage, a traffic alert electronic sign, speed monitoring or anything you can do to raise awareness. Even a long line of those tall thin traffic cones down the center of the road would be appreciated and helpful. Is there anything the city can do?

My neighbor at 509 Bayberry Bend, Lexington, KY  40517 is being the laziest neighbors. They have had trash sitting by their empty herbie for a few days now with trash blowing all over the neighborhood. I even say rodents getting into the trash by the road eating food out of the bags. They have several shredded packages that hold the roofing shingles sitting in their driveway blowing all over the neighborhood. The packages of shingles have been in their driveway for several years now. They rarely have their yard mowed. They have had a part of a tree leaning up against their house for some time now. It isn't like they are unable to do it. They are a couple in college that just doesn't care about the property and let them know they need to take care of their property keep from rodents getting into their trash and the appearance is bad too.

**Nuisance complaint**
am writing to formally report ongoing and unresolved code violations at 1301 Oxhill Drive, Lexington, KY. The property has been in a persistent state of disrepair for more than 9 years, and despite prior reports and visits, the conditions remain unacceptable.

The yard is filled with excessive junk, old appliances, animal traps, yard debris, ladders, and over 20 trash cans, among other scattered materials. The accumulation not only creates a severe visual blight but also presents a potential health hazard and fire risk to neighboring properties and the community at large.

It is unclear why enforcement efforts have not resolved this matter. As residents who value the safety and appearance of our neighborhood, we respectfully ask:
What must be done to ensure this situation is properly addressed and resolved once and for all?

Please advise on the status of any open cases associated with this address, as well as the next steps being taken toward abatement and compliance.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

**Nuisance complaint**
Tenant at Eagle Creek Apartments has left a junk black Cadillac Escalade parked in the street for months and it hasn't moved an inch. 

Same tenant has a motor cycle in complete disrepair with flat tires and parts hanging from the motorcycle. A previous complaint was submitted regarding this vehicle, however, the owner just moved it to the apartment's parking lot which occupied a parking spot causing another tenant to park in the street. 

Same tenant has another motorcycle parked in the street with suspected expired tags since the tag is faded and cannot be read. This motorcycle is orange in color and was recently tagged because it sat in front of someone's house for days. 

The owner of these vehicles treats the street like a junkyard--the street is already congested enough and these 3 vehicles occupy spots that visitors of the apartment complex can use. 

Further, Eagle Creek Townhomes is a source of many noise violations and does absolutely nothing to combat it. Eagle Creek Townhomes is a public nuisance as it does nothing to enforce its own rules which leads to people using the street like a junkyard. 

Please tow these vehicles and fine the owner--it's obvious he doesn't care.

**Traffic light/sign**
Traffic light at Alexandria and Harrodsburg needs to be adjusted. When the arrow to turn right onto Harrodsburg activates, the stop light at the diamond is red. There is always a very long line in the far left to get on to the New Circle ramp. Therefore, when you turn right to get in that far left lane, it is already backed up in the main intersection.

I waited through 2 turn arrows today and 12 minutes before I could get to the far left lane and it still was backed up into the intersection.

When the right arrow on Alexandria turns green, the lights at the diamond need to be green.

This is a problem all day long but especially morning rush hour, noon, and evening rush hour. Please correct this.

Intersection at 75 N towards Louisville/64 W towards Cincinnati and North Broadway Street (Paris Pike)  At Intersection at 75 N towards Louisville/64 W towards Cincinnati and North Broadway Street (Paris Pike), time of day: Mornings/Afternoons rush-hour traffic, there needs to be some traffic safety patrol mechanism in place to prevent motorists from blocking the intersection of North Broadway(Paris Pike) and 75 N towards Louisville/64 W towards Cincinnati at least while the reconstruction of the off-ramp is in progress to be completed.

Traffic engineers may consider re-evaluating the traffic signals at both intersections 75 N towards Louisville/64 W towards Cincinnati and 75 S towards Knoxville/64 E towards Ashland (at North Broadway) to ensure the traffic safety signals are in sync for safe transportation proceedings.

**Garbage collection**
I am VERY appreciative of the handicap service I recieve in garbage collection.  My issue is that SOMETIMES the bins, nearly always the Herbie is is left in the driveway blocking my car from getting in or out. I am 76, 4' 11"", and unable to walk at all without my walkers. It is only a few feet to replace back in position but it might as well be a mile. It would  take 5 seconds to replace it in its spot but it may be hours or more before I can get help. I know the guys go beyond their duties, thins like reckoning my gate because ai sometimes let the dog out without checking that they closed it. I would  normally talk to them but it is really hard to get to back door in time. I reluctantly call 311 now. In the past if there was an issue I could talk directly to was management and the ladies were lovely and understanding. Now you have one person screening calls for many departments. I am sure that is very stressful. She is very professional but I can't  understand why this happens. Maybe a new person?  I will be more careful about parking my car farther away from house so there is more more to pull bins out. Please let me know if there is more I can do. I can send pictures if you want. That you for all the help.

I'm working through the stages of grief. It's hard to say what's worst.

The terrible loneliness every morning when we would sit and have coffee and start our day.

The phone calls and text messages out of the blue because we were thinking about each other and dreaming of finally getting home after a long day.

Maybe it's the night when I can't watch our favorite TV shows anymore because they remind me of you and that one time...

Going to bed alone is no treat either. My bed is cold and lonely without you to share it with. I still reach out for you in the night and you're not there.

Feeling ripped in half isn't any fun. I was a complete person with you in my life. Now there's just tatters where I used to be.

They say it gets better. I get to decide who I want to be now. I'm not half of us anymore. All I want to be is who I was last week, last month, last year. Before you left me here.

They say the anger is just before you start to really heal. How could I ever be angry at you?

I wish you had listened to me. I wish you would have taken better care of yourself instead of worrying about the bills and the mortgage and the next promotion.

 I wish. Oh how I wish.

We went through some stuff didn't we? Family stuff, job stuff, life stuff and we were always there for each other. We survived tragedy together and we had our joys.

Now there's only me and this terrible emptiness.

We were enough for each other. We were strong when the other was weak. We took care of each other when one of us was sick or hungover or just in a bad mood.

I could tell you anything and together we worked out so many problems that would have crushed us separately.

I will figure out what to do with all of the empty hours. I will figure out how to live alone without you. I will figure out how to cook for one eventually. How to be alone.

I will figure it out darling. Because now I have to. I will be strong as I can and try to honor your memory in my actions and words until that day finally comes and we are together again.

Until then I will miss you every day.

* Feeling super drained and moody

Once I started eating a small snack beforehand (like half a banana or protein shake), I had more energy and found it easier to stay in control later in the day.

I’m not sure and I’m scared,"For over a week now, I’ve been dealing with something that might be panic attacks—but I’m really not sure. It started over a week ago when I got very angry. I suddenly felt a hot sensation and pressure behind my head, and I thought I had high blood pressure. The feeling kept growing stronger, and then I felt it in my ears—pressure and heat. Soon after, I started feeling pressure in my chest (not pain, just pressure), and a terrifying sensation like I couldn’t breathe.

Out of nowhere, I felt like I was about to faint. My arms and head became heavy, and I had to lie down. Every time I tried to sit or stand up, the fainting feeling came back. I was terrified—I had never experienced anything like this before. I also had the urge to vomit and pass stool at the same time. I genuinely thought I was going to die.

We went to the hospital. They measured my blood pressure and blood sugar—everything was perfect. I stayed there for a few hours, and the sensations kept coming and going. Since that day, I’ve been living in fear that it will happen again. A few times a day, I feel like I’m on the edge of another episode, but I try to calm myself and sometimes it passes.

The symptoms vary. Sometimes I feel pressure behind my head, sometimes at the top of my head, sometimes in my ears or chest. I often feel heat in my arms. Almost every time, I end up with nausea and the urge to pass stool. I did some blood tests—everything was fine except low ferritin and slightly low vitamin D. The doctor told me it was a panic attack, but I didn’t believe him at first, because the sensations felt so physical. I’ve never had panic attacks before—so why now? Why so often?

I also noticed that it gets worse after drinking coffee, so I’m avoiding it now.

Does this sound like panic attacks? Or could it be something else?
I’m honestly afraid that this will become my new normal, and the idea of having to live with this forever scares me deeply. Just thinking about it sometimes makes me feel like I’m going to have another one.",1,1752144704.0,PanicAttack,1,1.0,False

Synopsis - Newly hired and recruited by the Agency, you will now meet your senior! She’s soft, kind hearted, and very motherly.. However, she has not quite gotten over her past.. Thankfully, you are here to help!

Settings: Inside HUGE SPACESHIP: The Courtyard, Shopping mall, Greenhouse.

(Futuristic)

This script has a lot of worldbuilding, backstory, and has some emotional voice acting in it!  
Contact me if you want the custom thumbnail for this script!

  
Here is the beginning of the script:

\*Watering Can, pouring water over flowers.\*  
\*Soft, gentle humming\*

\*Humming abruptly halted by watering the Listener\*

(Concern)

“O-Oh! Oh dear, I’m so sorry, I had no idea you were sleeping there.. I didn't mean to pour water on you…”

“Are you alright…? Thank goodness, I’m glad. But you, young man… Why were you sleeping in The Courtyard..?”

…

“You passed out after training, is it? Then that means… you’re a new recruit! Now that I think about it, I don’t think I’ve seen you around before.. You really are a new Agent then, Correct?”

\[Cerelia is pronounced “Sir-rel-li-ya”\]

“I see..My codename is ‘BERSERKER’, but just call me Cerelia.. Or Ms. Selene.”

“Goodness, I forgot to dry you off.. You’re still soaking wet! Let me get you a towel, young man..”

“All dry now.. Say, is this your first day aboard the Icon?”

..

“Yes, the Icon. Did they not brief you of this place? It is a giant habitable spaceship, and The Courtyard is only one of MANY floors aboard the Icon. I personally water the flowers here. Gardening is my favorite pastime, as there aren’t many others who enjoy tending to the flowers here like I do, and it keeps me… distracted.”

…

“What made me take up gardening, you ask?”

“Ah… It… It just helps me honor the memory of some people. A… long story. I even have my own personal little greenhouse.  But more importantly.. I should make it up to you for pouring water on your face… “

…

“Oh. You’re hungry? Then let's get something to eat! My treat, so don’t worry at all about paying, Sweetie-... I-I mean, young man.. Actually,  I forgot to ask you your name! What is it?”

…

“That is a lovely name.. Do you have a codename? No? They’ll give you one once you complete your training, and your abilities are fully understood. Everyone’s codename is related to what makes them special on deployment…”



(slightly nervous)

“W-What’s my ability..? Uh.. I think.. I think that’s classified, young man.. But let’s just say.. I’m a lot stronger than I look.” 

“Maybe another time.. Didn’t you say you were hungry?”

(Calmed down)

“We’ll go to The Strip, then. They have an amazing food court there… Come along now... What are you in the mood for eating? I’m personally getting my favorite dessert.. What is it? You'll see\~”

Sound fading into the next setting..\*

…

\*Ambient sounds of chatter; a food court!\*

“You're wondering why our headquarters spaceship has a food court?”

“Well, It is just as important to have recreational centers for Agents as it is to have training halls and meeting rooms before our missions! New Earth’s government will NOT hold back on these services.. After all, we're not just here to work, we’re here to live until our retirement! Or our last breath, with how risky some of these missions are… Especially since our contracts keep us bound to this job. By signing the contract to become an agent, we already know too much, and they'll send Agents to hunt us down if any one of us were to betray or abandon the Agency. Doing the dirty work for the government of New Earth isn't pretty, but it certainly doesn't sell itself short.”

“Anyways… What are you getting? There's food stands here for practically everything, so choose whatever you’d like!”

…

“You want that one? Sure. It's the least I could do..”

“Let me order it for you… take a seat right here!”

\*Her voice fades somewhat as she leaves.\*

…

“Annnnd here you go! I hope you didn't mind the wait… I wanted to get my dessert.. ready to see what I was talking about?

\*Placed on the table!\*

“Tada! This, young man is called Tiramisu! The perfect dessert.. spongey, coffee-cocoa goodness!”

\*Taking a bite…\* “Mmm..!\~ Can’t ever get tired of this…”

1lw9kuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/aquarius/comments/1lw9kuj/need_advice_from_aquariuswoman/,Need advice from Aquarius-Woman,"The situation is as follows:

I’m a Taurus, not the typical kind. And my story involves an Aquarius woman.

We once fell in love when she was 15 and I was 16. Then we lost touch. Years later, she suddenly added me back on Facebook out of nowhere.

Everything was going well until she found out I had been talking to one of her girlfriends. Their relationship wasn’t great, but as a Taurus, I was simply trying to help that friend with some life lessons. The Aquarius woman thought I had suddenly shifted my attention from her to her friend. I explained clearly that this wasn’t the case. She said she lost her trust, but after some honest communication, she still wanted to stay friends.

Then out of the blue, she invited me for coffee, although it never happened. Months later, we ran into each other by chance. We ended up having drinks together, and it was amazing. She opened up in ways that truly surprised me. We laughed, shared deep conversations, and talked about meaningful topics like how we see life, raising children, work, and spirituality. She told me it was interesting and that she was learning a lot from me. That I carry deep knowledge. And yes, sex came up too.

I’ve heard that Aquarius women don’t open up like that unless it really means something.

But then a day or two later, she told me: “It’s nice to talk, but not every day.”

How should I interpret that?

Did I open her heart and now she needs time to process?  
Is this her way of creating distance and keeping things as friends?

1lw9khm,https://www.reddit.com/r/LFTM/comments/1lw9khm/a_murder_of_one/,A Murder of One,"*Are two crows a murder? Or is a murder three or more?*

He considered the question mutely as two black birds conversed with one another on the branch of a magnificent sycamore tree. His gaze wandered to and fro along the tree's smooth, vitiligo bark - following the nude undulations of its fleshy branches - all while the two birds cawed at one another. He wondered at what they might be saying, those two birds, those old friends, perhaps old lovers. He found it pleasing to imagine they were lovers, or at least, that they had been, once upon a time.

He sat at a small wrought iron table. His right hand rested on the sun warm metal filigree and busied itself tracing the ornate patterns with the pads of its fingers. The warm, rough-smooth metal seemed to glow with internal heat as his blind digits caressed the table's abstruse surface as if searching for hidden glyphs from which power might be extracted.

In his left hand he held a cup of coffee. Black, no sugar. It was no longer hot, only sun warm. He had neglected to drink a sip.

The blackbirds went silent for a long moment, and their silence seemed to break him out of some reverie - seemed to interrupt some line of thought he'd begun following in the patchwork skin of the sycamore tree. His right hand froze and his eyes widened, and darted to and fro, searching for something he didn't know he was looking for until he'd found it - a second cup of coffee, sitting on the far end of the table.

*That's strange* he thought to himself.

And it was strange. Because there was no one else at the table with him. Whose coffee was this? He leaned forward and peered into the styrofoam cup. It was light - milky - *no, half and half* - light and sweet.

*How do I know that?*

He considered the question. He hadn't tasted the coffee. Was it a guess? Or perhaps intuition?

The ravens began cawing loudly at one another. The noise startled him and his left hand twitched, sending his coffee sloshing over the edge of his own styrofoam cup and onto his pants leg. It was cold to the touch on the hot summer day, almost refreshing. He hardly noticed. His eyes were fixed on the two angry crows. They began to peck at one another in a squabble, before the smaller of the two flew off in a huff, leaving behind it's erstwhile lover to yell after it.

He remembered in a flash that he'd made both coffees, though he couldn't remember how long ago, let alone why he'd done it. He looked into the sky and searched for the sun and using an instinctive calculative thought process he could not longer have explained to anyone, even himself, he intuited that it was about 1 o'clock.

*How long have I been sitting here?* he wondered, and the thought caused him to feel a pang of alarm - though only a slight pang. He was, after all, certain he belonged where he was, though he could not have said why. He just knew, in his bones, that he was where he needed to be, doing what he needed to be doing, sitting at this wrought iron table, beneath this stately sycamore tree, holding his black coffee in his styrofoam cup, looking again at the light and sweet coffee on the other side of the table.

*Why did I make that coffee* he wondered again. Why and for whom? He couldn't say for the life of him. Only he knew he was right to have done so. Moreover, sitting there, covered in his own tepid brew, a light wind caressing the hairs of his beard, he knew that he had made that coffee, just so, countless times before. He felt, looking at it now, as the lonely blackbird whined sadness into the air of the courtyard, that making that coffee, light and sweet - half and half with three sugars - was so significant to him as to rise to the level of magic. The level of ritual beyond routine. Ritual in the critical sense - in the sense of survival. He felt, of a sudden, that making that coffee was central to his entire identity - that if he ever neglected to make it, his life, his entire self, such as it was, would unravel.

*I'm vapor without you* came the thought, unbidden, accompanied by the welling of tears.

""Mr. Johnson, you have a visitor.""

Mr. Johnson looked up, his reverie shattered, and saw a man before him all in white. A kind enough looking man, a young man. Mr. Johnson did not recognize him whatsoever, nor could he imagine who might be visiting him, nor why. Still, he nodded at the young man and muttered ""of course"", almost inaudibly, several times. 

The young man in white smiled and took notice of the wetness on Mr. Johnson's thigh. ""Oh, looks like you had a little spill, let me get you a towel."" The young man said, before turning toward someone else and gesturing to the wrought iron table and the seat beside it. ""I'll be right back.""

A young woman stepped up to the edge of the table. She hesitated for a long moment before sitting, waiting, possibly, for some sign that she'd been seen. Mr. Johnson was lost in thought again, however, and it was only when she sat down across from him that his eyes broke off from their renewed journey among the folds of the sycamore tree and came to rest upon her face. 

He smiled. She smiled back. Recognition flooded through him and his gratitude for it was immeasurable. He could feel his heart swell with the warmth of love and the tears that had started to well up in his eyes moments ago fell onto his cheeks, hot.

""I've been having such a strange afternoon."" He said, and his voice was as rejuvenated as his spirits. ""Your coffee's cold, I'm afraid.""

The young woman smiled again, softly, and picked up the the styrofoam cup. ""Light and sweet"", she said, wistfully, and with pointed care she took a small sip. She closed her eyes and savored it for a long moment before putting it down again. 

""Where have you been?"" he asked without frustration, ""I was wondering where you'd gotten off to.""

The young woman folded her hands onto the table in front of her and looked down at them ""Oh, you know, working a lot. Busy.""

He smiled and took a gulp of what remained of his own cold coffee. The acrid taste felt fantastic on his tongue, like an old friend. Warmly he reached over the table and placed one his hands onto hers. ""Well, boy am I glad you're here.""

The young man returned just then with a small hand towel. ""Let me get that for you Mr. Johnson,"" he said, and began to pat at the wet pants. Mr. Johnson said nothing, his gaze fixed on the young woman, tracing the lines of her face with enormous affection. She seemed to wither beneath that gaze, but he was undeterred. 

""You're as beautiful as ever, you know that?"" He said, in awe. 

The young man finished his task and smiled again. ""Careful now, Mr. Johnson - we don't want you burning yourself."" Then, without another word, he walked away. 

The young woman sighed. A long, exasperated sigh - sad and tired. ""Thank you,"" she said, almost a whisper. 

""So,"" Mr. Johnson put down his coffee cup and brought both his hands to hers, ""what are we doing today?""

The young woman grew uncomfortable and gently extricated her hands from beneath his. ""I can only stay for a little while, I've got an appointment at 4.""

He was disappointed but tried not to let it show. The raven crowed. The sound sent a chill through his spine. He tensed. 

It must have been visible, because she asked ""Are you alright?""

He could hardly hear her beneath the sound of his heart beating relentlessly - fear and anxiety coursed through his body like electricity. His lower lip began to quiver as if he were a small child again and he had to shut his eyes and find someplace, any place to hold onto. He felt the distinct sense of falling inward, as if his mind was a chasm into which he might forever disappear. 

*Light and sweet. Half and half and three sugars.* 

He thought to himself, again and again, like a mantra. 

*Light and sweet. Half and half and three sugars*. 

Like the glow of a lighthouse in a heavy fog, the saying was a beacon. He followed it back, rowing for an invisible sure through the haze of his mind.

*Light and sweet.  Half and half and three sugars*

He felt so lost. Confusion welled up inside him and only that singular idea tethered him to some notion of himself. Like a rope thrown down a deep well which he climbed, and climbed, the light of day far above hardly visible, a lifetime away.

""Are you OK?""

He opened his eyes and saw the young woman looking at him with concern and he realized he'd been muttering the words out loud. Seeing her face brought him back to life though and his heart eased and his fear receded. The coffee was for her, after all. Years, decades of coffee. A distillate of love. 

She looked at her watch. ""I've got to get going.""

His disappointment was only slightly less immeasurable than his surprise. Again he turned towards the sun and used the instinct he no longer understood to read its place in time. He was astonished to realize it was almost 3. Where had two hours gone?

""Wait,"" he said, reaching out a hand, ""I, please, I miss you so much. Can you just, maybe, just stay the night? I just,"" he reached out for her hands again and squeezed them gently, ""I've missed you so much, Madeleine. I can't tell you how much. It,"" the crow cawed, or was it a blackbird, or a raven, the lonesome cry of a lonesome bird "",it's been so hard being without you. Madeleine, please stay with me. Please don't leave. I love you. I've always loved you, I always will love you.""

The young woman sighed again, and now tears ran down her soft cheeks and she sucked her teeth and gently moved her hands out from under his and put them on top of his and looked him in the eyes with patient but firm warmth. 

""Dad, I'm not Madeleine. I'm Angela. Angela, your daughter, Angela. Do you,"" She hesitated and then bit her lip ""do you remember?""

He blinked. The lonesome bird cawed again. The wind caressed the threadbare white hairs on his head like gentle, invisible fingers.

She turned away from him and started to leave ""Dad, I just can't do this right now. I've got to go.""

He reached out a hand, as if to stop her, but accidentally knocked over the styrofoam cup of coffee. It spilled through the cast iron filligree of the table onto the brick of the courtyard floor. He followed the light brown liquid as it pooled into a puddle as his daughter left without another word, her face stained with tears. 

Above him, high in the majestic sycamore tree, the crow cawed longingly and flew off into the distance, in search.",1,1752144335.0,LFTM,0,1.0,False

1lw9h2c,https://i.redd.it/15aoxb2nz0cf1.gif,Joko4D: Where Slot Games Meet a Pulse,"At first glance, *Joko4D* might sound like just another name in the world of online games. But if you ask the regulars—those who know when reels spin just right—they'll tell you something different:

>

# Not Just Games—A Vibe

What sets Joko4D apart isn’t just the selection (though yes, the slots are solid). It’s the rhythm of the experience. You log in, and nothing screams for your attention. No neon chaos. Just a clean interface, fast loading, and titles that actually matter.

But here’s the twist:  
People don’t stay just because of the slots.  
They stay because **something’s always happening**.

Flash events. Insider tips in the live chat. A random user just hit maxwin on Olympus—and suddenly, you’re in.

# Why Joko4D Is Earning Street Cred

1. **Genuine Game Flow** The layout isn’t here to impress—it’s here to work. It runs smooth, even on low-end phones, and doesn’t bury you in banners.
2. **The Right Kind of Noise** There’s always a buzz—real players talking, sharing times when Sweet Bonanza feels loose, or when Starlight is heating up.
3. **Bonuses with No Fine Print** The bonus system doesn’t read like a lawyer’s email. New member promos, cashback, and referrals are straight-up clean.
4. **CS That Replies Before Your Coffee Cools** Real talk: their support replies fast. Not “we got your ticket” fast—actual human fast.

# What People Play

These are the games people whisper about in group chats:

* **Gates of Olympus** – Zeus still rules the reels, throwing lightning when you least expect it.
* **Starlight Princess** – Bright, unpredictable, and occasionally brutal in the best way.
* **Sweet Bonanza** – That rare blend of chaos and color that keeps you spinning.

Every player has their own “go-to,” but these three… they’ve become something of a holy trinity.

# Not Just Talk — Backed by Security

Money in, money out—nobody wants games with delay. Joko4D’s transaction system is quick, transparent, and doesn’t pretend to “process” for hours. Your wins land like they should.

# More Than Maxwin

For many, Joko4D started as a place to test luck. But it quickly became more:  
A place to learn.  
A space to observe patterns.  
A room to quietly chase the thrill—while knowing someone else across the country is doing the exact same thing.

In an industry full of noise, Joko4D found a frequency of its own.

# Final Word

Joko4D is not the loudest name out there. And maybe that’s the point.  
It’s built for those who know what they’re looking for—  
**and what they’re tired of.**

If you’re into that feeling when reels sync up perfectly with your gut feeling—  
you might’ve just found your new favorite tab.",1,1752143987.0,u_Wild_Weight6918,0,1.0,False
1lw9g2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lw9g2o/should_you_try_the_hario_v60_dripassist_for/,Should You Try the Hario V60 Drip-Assist for Perfect Pour Over Coffee?,"Testing out the Hario PDA-02-T has been quite the experience because I drink coffee daily and demand consistency in my morning brew. For someone who values precision and ease of use in their coffee-making setup, this product immediately stood out. With its manual operation and compact size, it caters specifically to those who enjoy the process of making pour-over coffee but want a little extra help achieving that perfect brew.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Its clear body and matte finish give it a sleek, modern look that blends well on my kitchen counter. The compact dimensions (10.92""D x 10.92""W x 4.83""H) make it perfect for small spaces, and since I don’t have much room in my kitchen, this design choice really works for me. The plastic exterior feels durable, but I could see some people wishing for a more premium material. However, considering I’ve accidentally knocked the product a few times, I appreciate its resilience.

**Ease of Use**  
The thing that truly caught my attention is how straightforward it is to use. You simply place the Drip-Assist on top of any 02 V60 dripper, pour hot water, and the design handles the rest. For someone who doesn’t yet own a gooseneck kettle (although I’ve been eyeing a good one), this product eliminates the need entirely. The small holes in the Drip-Assist ensure even water distribution, which results in consistent pours without the risk of overpouring or messing up the coffee bed. For a beginner, this feature is an absolute lifesaver, and even as someone familiar with the process, I can see its value in simplifying my mornings.

**Merits**  
- Even water flow eliminates the need for a gooseneck kettle.  
- Compact and lightweight design fits easily in small kitchens.  
- Ensures consistent brewing by preventing overpour accidents.  

[Check Hario PDA-02-T price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b08xbjnvqh/)

**Performance in Action**  
I tested it with a variety of coffee beans, and here’s what stood out: the water flow is perfectly controlled, ensuring proper blooming and extraction. I followed the suggested instructions, pouring 50-70ml of water in the inner ring first, pausing for 30 seconds, and then pouring the remaining water into the outer ring. What amazed me was how effortlessly the water flowed into the center ring without needing constant adjustments from my end. Though I did notice the brewing process takes slightly longer than manual pouring with a traditional gooseneck kettle, the tradeoff is worth it for the fuss-free experience.

**Shortcomings**  
- Plastic material may not satisfy users craving a premium finish.  
- Brewing can take slightly longer compared to direct pouring.  

**How It Compares to Competitors**  
When lined up beside classics like the Chemex or even other Hario pour-over models, this one feels like a specialized tool rather than just a dripper. While traditional pour-over alternatives still require precise pouring techniques, this product essentially handles that step for you, making it perfect for beginners or those lacking precise pouring equipment. Competitors like the Melitta cone lack this convenience feature entirely, although they are a bit more affordable. On the other hand, premium electric pour-over options, such as the Technivorm Moccamaster, provide automation but lose the hands-on manual experience that pour-over enthusiasts like me cherish.

**Value for Money**  
For something that bridges the gap between manual brewing and convenience, the price feels justified. It’s certainly not the cheapest add-on for a V60 setup, but it’s far more affordable than an electric kettle or an automated pouring machine. Beyond just the cost, the product saves time and effort, which is really where its financial value shines.

Share your weird food peeves!,"Over the years, I’ve realised I’m quite the picky eater. Don’t know how many of you can relate or face the same struggle.

My most hated food of all time – malai (that top layer of milk). I hate hate hate the texture.
Since I’m a hardcore chai drinker, I’ve come up with a system – the moment I pour chai into my cup, I immediately put a spoon in and keep stirring it every 5 seconds. I never let malai form on top. Works every time.

I hate most milk-based stuff. I can’t drink plain milk – not lactose intolerant or anything, just genuinely hate the taste. Cold coffee, though? Love it.
Because of this, I also stay far away from most milk-based desserts like kheer, sewaiyan, etc.

I’ll eat raw tomatoes, but the moment they’re cooked in curry or dal – nope. Not touching them. Probably because of the texture.

Also, not a big fruit person. I hate mango. Might eat it if someone forces me, but I’d never willingly reach for one.

And when it comes to Indian sweets – I can’t do the wet ones like gulab jamoon, rasgulla, etc. Just not for me. But I do like the dry ones like kaju katli.

Edit- Forgot to add I hate that cold tiffin wali maggi. Sorry to say, but maggi is meant to be eaten hot. Not the cold sticky block stuck to the tiffin. 🥲

1lw9dgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lw9dgy/aitah_for_being_upset_that_my_best_friend_didnt/,AITAH for being upset that my best friend didn’t stand up for me when I was excluded from a group trip she “invited” me on?,"It’s a long one, so buckle up.

I (25F) have been friends with Olivia (fake name) for 8 years — best friends for the past 4. She’s moved house 4 times in the last 3 years, and each time, I was there. Sleeping on mattresses, Packing boxes, helping her settle in. Always showing up for her. No question.

Now for some context: Olivia has a long-time friend, let’s call her Rebecca. Recently, Olivia has been spending time with Rebecca and her close-knit group of girlfriends. I’d been invited out once or twice, but could never make it due to work. No bad blood.

Then Olivia mentions a girls' trip to Italy that she and Rebecca were planning. On the phone — after my nail appointment, while I was shopping, sipping an iced coffee (weird detail, I know — but you remember moments that turn into emotional landmines) — she said:
“There’s going to be a few of us — come if you can!”

I was so excited. I picked up extra shifts, booked time off work, and kept talking about the trip to my boyfriend — and to Olivia. It felt like something special we’d do together.

There’s something else too: I was bullied at school. Picked on, excluded, pushed out of a girl group — the whole thing. So as an adult, I’ve always been really cautious around large groups of girls. Olivia knows this. I told her I was nervous about integrating with a tight group of women I didn’t know. She reassured me that this group was different — kind, safe, no drama. That I’d get along with everyone.

Weeks later, I’m added to a group chat about the trip. It’s kind of dead, not much activity. I ask Olivia about plans, and she says, “Oh, let me add you to the new chat.”
This second group chat has more people — six of us total — and new trip dates. I introduce myself, make a few jokes, even suggest we hop on a group call to book flights together.

A few days go by and then — bam. I get a message from Rebecca.
Not Olivia.
Rebecca.
Saying, in the kindest way possible, that the girls didn’t feel comfortable going on a trip with someone they didn’t know very well. They’d rather keep it to their group — but “would love to meet me another time.”

I left the group chat immediately and sent a screenshot to Olivia. Her response?
“Not you not having her number saved 🤭😂😂”

I said, “I can’t lie, I don’t find any of this funny.”
She tried to call, but I was crying and couldn’t speak.

The next day I told her how let down I felt — not just by the exclusion, but by the fact that she didn’t stand up for me. Her first response was defensive. She said she didn’t know they were going to uninvite me, that maybe I was reacting this strongly because of past things I’ve bottled up.

Then she said it:
I invited myself.
That I just kind of inserted myself into the plans.

That’s when it really broke for me. Because if I was never truly invited, why was I added to not one but TWO group chats? Why did she never correct me when I was making plans, asking about flights, talking about the trip for weeks?

Eventually, after a long back-and-forth, she did apologise — not for the way she handled it, but for how I feel. But she’s still sticking to the version of events where I invited myself.

The worst part? She didn’t defend me. She didn’t say to the group, “Hey, this isn’t kind,” or “This is my best friend, she deserves better.” And now that I know she didn’t actually invite me in the first place, I guess that explains why she didn’t fight for me — because she didn’t feel strongly about me being there to begin with.

If the roles were reversed, I know I’d have stood up for her. I would’ve said something. If one of my friends tried to do this to her, I’d be calling it out immediately. But that same energy just wasn’t there.

So now I’m sitting with this awful, humiliated feeling, questioning whether my “best friend” ever really saw me that way.

The clinic appears to offer an exceptional combination of modern facilities, cleanliness, and accessibility, with numerous physicians available for appointments within the same building. It even has a coffee and coworking space inside.

1lw98up,https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatiaTravelTips/comments/1lw98up/weekend_trip_and_also_10_days_holidays/,Weekend trip and also 10 days holidays !,"Hey everyone!

I'm currently on an exchange program for two weeks here in Croatia (Zagreb, more precisely), and I just recovered from a nasty cold (or maybe it was a karma hangover lol). I've been here for a few days now, and I'm starting to feel like a human again, so I'm planning a short trip this weekend and also thinking about a bigger roadtrip next week when I get more days off.

So here's the thing:

* For this weekend, I'm looking for a nice place to chill, maybe by the sea or some small town with cute old buildings and food. I'm still a bit tired so nothing too crazy. I'm also considering taking a bus and getting to know another country nearby, maybe Bosnia or Slovenia? Any ideas?
* For next week, I’m thinking about renting a car and doing a small Balkan loop. Like... from Croatia down through Bosnia, maybe Montenegro, Albania, and (if not too crazy) Greece??  (i'll have like 10 days)

But I have no idea if that’s possible or stupid. How are the borders these days? Is it easy to cross between these countries with a EU passport? Do I need insurance or any specific documents? And do the rent-a-car companies allow you to cross borders like that?

Also, any tips for hidden gems, beautiful stops, weird towns, good food, or just peaceful places with water and cats are more than welcome.

Thanks in advance! And if anyone is around Zagreb and wants to share a coffee or a glass of wine, let me know :)
