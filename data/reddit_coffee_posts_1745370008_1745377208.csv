1k5ozz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatanicTemple_Reddit/comments/1k5ozz3/piercings_in_the_workplace/,Piercings in the workplace,"Hi friends!
My workplace (Starbucks) is really cracking down on the dress code, which I’m fine with, except one rule, being 1 small facial piercing only. I have 6. Paired eyebrows, Medusa, paired nostrils (with chain), and septum. Is there a tenet or something else that protects me and my facial piercings? 

Things to consider: 1) I’ve been with the company for 6 years and the 1 piercing rule has always existed, but no one has enforced it on me, including store managers, district managers, and even a regional manager. 
2) It doesn’t impact my job. If anything, it creates conversations between me and the customers. They always compliment them. 
3) I haven’t sat down with my manager yet, but I’m gonna fight my point, hopefully utilizing religious protection. I will try to convince him first before pulling the religious card. 
4) I will quit before I take out my piercings. They cost me too much pain, money, and aftercare to ditch them for a part time job at a coffee shop. They are a part of me, my confidence, and my identity/expression. 

I was thinking tenet #3, but was wondering if there are any more and/or stronger points to protect me?

Thank you in advance 🖤

1k5oysh,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1k5oysh/the_brookenshire_annual_chilioff/,The brookenshire annual chili-off,"In the small neighborhood of  brookenshire it’s almost time for the annual chili cook off…plastered to every street corner is a sign.. 

BROOKENSHIRE CHILI COOK OFF
THIS SATURDAY AT THE 
BROOKENSHIRE PARK…
12 pm - 5pm
There will be games and inflatables and face painting and most of all Chili..

Bring your family. 

The sign says, just before falling, and the missing girl Elizabeth Yates. 
Last scene 09/12/2022
wearing a pink hoodie and jeans. 
Age 10… just below

Wendy pressed the the staple gun into the post to cover up the most likely dead girl. It’s been a year since she went missing.. no sign of her anywhere, it’s almost like she vanished. Wendy didn’t  even know why we do this stupid tradition when girls seem to be going missing. Wendy pulled another advertisement of the chili cook off, staple it. It’s our neighborhoods biggest cash grab. It helps fund the HOA, and the neighborhood pool. Which is a huge hit in the July heat. I go to the next post staple, staple, staple, staple. 
Wendy went post to post. Wendy heard a voice behind her…

“Wendy, how are you doing!” Ms. Penelope says startling me into almost stapling my thumb.

“Oh hi Ms. Penelope I’m doing okay, just same ol same ol” wendy said. It’s October but it’s still warm from a late summer warmth. 

She was sitting in her lawn chair like she does every evening, she had a pitcher of lemonade but it was almost empty and some cookies. 

“Would you want some lemonade, Wendy?” Seeing me sweat. Must have read my mind..


“Yes please. Ms Penelope!” She poured wendy a cup, but the lemonade only filled up a little.

“Oh shoot, maybe take a break and ill get you some more, you can come inside if you want to cool off in my cool A/C it’ll just be a couple minutes.”

Thinking of the missing poster made Wendy  hesitant, but I was hot so I agreed.

Wendy put her bag of advertisements down by the post and walked up her yard. I texted my mom where I was just incase..

Mom: okay sweetie just be nice, she is the nicest neighbor. 

Wendy walked  into her front door and a cool blast of A/C Hits her. 

TWO DAYS BEFORE THE CHILI OFF.

“Have you seen my little girl!” I pleaded to Ms. Penelope as she sat in custody, she had blood dried on her head, and a black eye. 

“Have you seen my LITTLE WENDY.” I screamed 

You were the last place she texted me from and now she’s missing.

“I told you I never saw your Wendy, I don’t know who texted you that message” she said.

I almost try to attack her, but I get held back by two police officers

“Ms. Engelson SIT DOWN.” The officer screams. Pushing me into a chair and then I feel a cold metal handcuff on my hand. Its cold, and tight. 

“You will sit here until you calm down” he says before returning with Ms. Penelope and guiding her into a room with a big mirror. A couple hours goes by, I am awoken by an officer and unlocked I see Ms.  Penelope leave to her car. Before I’m escorted into the room.
I’m sat down into a metal chair, a hot cup of coffee is infront of me. The steam is rising and the smell kind of calms me down.

“Ms. Engelson do you know why you’re here?” The officer here.

“Yes, no, I think so” I said nervously.

“You’re daughter Wendy is it? When is the last time you saw her?” He asked 

It was Monday evening before she headed out to volunteer to put up ads for the chili-off, I remember her volunteering because she needed some sort of volunteer hours for school.” I said.

“What was she wearing if you can remember?” He asked sipping into his own coffee cup.

“She was wearing a white KINGSLEY HIGH shirt and a pair of ripped jean shorts she had her jewelry on, I think she was wearing a class ring, and a necklace.” I pulled out my phone and showed him a picture of the last photo I had of her. I made sure she sent me the most current picture of herself incase she ended up like that one girl. Which by the way they’re still missing. What have you done to figure out where they are.” I could hear my voice getting louder, the tears began to fall again.

“Will you find my little Wendy?” I said now crying…

“We’re working on finding her and the others.” He said…

“It’s been a year since the last one went missing and you guys let that case go cold. Please don’t let my little Wendy go cold.” I said

“We’re doing everything we can mam. We’re going to find her.” He said.

“I think that’s all for tonight, we’ll keep in touch.” He handed me a small card and I got up walked out of the station and went to my car.  I was about to open my door when a text came through.

Unknown: I know where Wendy is, get into your car and leave don’t tell anyone. 

I looked around up until this moment I didn’t even feel safe but now I felt watched.

Me: who is this…
Me: where are you.
Me: where is my little Wendy..
….

The bubbles popped up like a new message was about to come through…

Then an image link…

I was hesitant to click it… I could and should walk back to the station and show it to the officers.

Unknown: DONT SHOW THE POLICE.
Unknown: click the image.

I clicked the link.

And what popped up… made me drop my phone. A nearby officer saw and walked over..

“Are you okay mam.”

“Mam, are you okay.” 

I pick up my phone, and I say I’m fine. I get into my car and the look at the image…

My little Wendy was in the photo.. but she was sleeping or maybe worse dead. She had an apple in her mouth. Her legs and her hands were bound up behind her. 

Me: is she alive….
Me: why is she like that.
Me: if you touch my little girl I will find you I will find you and kill you.

I opened my door and threw up. This time I didn’t know what to do. I decided to show the cops. But I didn’t leave the car. I lowered my phone and pulled out the card. I sent the number screen shots of the messages.

To which I get a call…
I hang up, 

Me: they’re watching me…

Unknown: you shouldn’t have done that with a devil emoji… 
I drive home… I get out a bottle of bourbon, I chug it and then ask 

Me: where are you where is my Wendy.
Unknown: too late…

Me: I WILL FIND YOU AND I WILL KILL YOU…
Message not delivered…
Retry.
Message not delivered 
Retry

I get a call again from the police from earlier. 

I answer… 

“What the fuck is going on” he yells.

“We will find that bastard and take them down, don’t leave your house.” 

I look at the image over and over. I scan the image for clues. I throw up again.

Then I see it, a small picture frame but I can’t make out the people in it.

I zoom in but it’s too blurry. 

The phone rings…
Unknown.

I answer imediately.. but I press the record call button 

Silence at first but I can hear something in the background it sounds like maybe cats. Or something meowing.
Then I hear in a raspy voice..

“Mom…. Mom I don’t have much time I love you. It’s not who you think it is. But it’s someone in the neighborhood.. “ she said crying before I hear a whack and then her cries. 

“Hello, mommy” a familiar voice but I can’t place my finger on it…

Then click nothing…

I call the police, they tell me they’ll have a unit outside and someone inside to keep me safe. I show them the call.

The voice sounds so familiar…

I cry myself to sleep. That night after the cops show up and I let them have my phone.

ONE DAY BEFORE THE CHILI-OFF

The next morning I wake up to multiple people in my house.. cops I gave them the okay to set up base at my house. 
I quickly get up and dressed and go down stairs. They’re buzzing and have been using my phone incase he calls back but nothing.

I get some coffee.. we have to go door to door..
We have to find Wendy and where there is Wendy there is others.

Go in pairs.

Every door, in normal clothes. Don’t set off any alarms. We need to get a neighborhood meeting together.

“I can do that” I know almost everyone in the neighborhood..
I spend the whole day calling everyone to call others to get together. We have to cancel the chili off. We have to find him or her.  I call neighbor after neighbor.

Then the cop says wait don’t cancel the cook off. They might be there…
I nervously said …”okay”

If he’s there he will be found.
The whole day went into a blur neighbors came by and brought stuff, and offered to help.
Slowly the whole neighborhood was in and out of my house getting their names and finger printed. 

Ms. Penelope
Mr. And Mr. Lucky
Ms/mr Henderson.
Mrs. Greatly 
Ms. Happy 
Mrs/mrs troops
And so on 

None of them sounded like the voice.

Around 11:30 pm. My phone started buzzing

Unknown…

I told the cops and they put a tracer on my phone.

“Hello.” I said. 
“ you might be too late” the voice said
“WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY LITTLE GIRL” I screamed
“I see the cops are there I hope you like the chili.”
Click.

“HES WATCHING THE HOUSE”
Then four cops left the house.

A man walking the dog nearby was tackled.
A woman running a late night jog was also 

But neither of them were the person on the phone.


WELCOME TO THE ANNUAL CHILI-OFF
a big sign said but no one was making any chili. 
Although to the neighborhood surprise. 

Booths we’re already set up with chili already scenting the air There was five booths set up cooking with the names of the five missing girls the cops showed up immediately to see the big iron pans boiling. Five cops went to look inside each of the big metal pans and to their horror each one had the remains of the missing girls cooking…

The parents all screamed…

But the scary thing was no one was found responsible they checked for DNA. They checked for fingerprints they checked for anything that could nail someone down, but it was like nobody set up the PANS. Nobody was ever found guilty brookenshire neighborhood… overnight and over the course of weeks became an abandoned neighborhood. The family is grieved the loss of their loved ones, but it was an agreement. Everyone would just moved
Erased from the map..

20 years later.
The brookenshire neighborhood is run down, kids now tell the story of the almost cannibalistic chili bake off as a rummage through the old houses until they reach Mr. Gregorio’s old house now a retired cop the cop that was immediately on the case 20 years ago inside his house, which was no graffiti and rundown they made their to the basement they hear something that sounds like meowing. As they make their way to the door in the basement, the meowing or the whimpering gets louder to their surprise. they opened the door and inside to their horror. Five women still alive older, living off dead mice and another body. Chained to the walls. Somehow the cops were called, but the guy that was on the case 20 years ago has been long gone 20 years. The five missing girls have been found. The real question is who or what was in the chili?",1,1745377064.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I've been thinking lately about how we can help students in Karachi who are planning to move abroad. With more and more students leaving for studies and managing expenses by working part-time jobs like at marts, car washes, delivery gigs, or cafes-why not offer something similar here to help them prepare?

With all the new coffee shops and eateries popping up all over Karachi, why not create short-duration, paid internships or training programs that allow these students to gain hands-on experience? Not only would this give them valuable skills, but it would also look great on future job applications abroad.

I'd love to collaborate with anyone who's interested in building a platform to make this happen. It's about time we drop our egos and realize that gaining experience (or just earning some cash) is part of the journey
—whether it's now or later, especially if you're planning to move abroad.
What do you all think? Would love to hear your thoughts!

TI;dr: Students heading abroad often work odd jobs to cover expenses. Let's offer paid internships or training in Karachi, helping them gain skills and experience before they leave. Who's in to make this happen?",1,1745376963.0,karachi,0,0.6,False
1k5oxjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ourtownreno/comments/1k5oxjy/citizens_forum_a_walk_with_abby_to_cure_juvenile/,Citizen's Forum: A Walk with Abby To Cure Juvenile Dermatomyositis,"On Sunday, April 27, families from around the Reno area will gather at Sparks Marina Park for Walk Strong to Cure JM, a community event focused on raising funds and awareness for juvenile myositis, a rare and life-threatening autoimmune disease in children. With recent cuts to NIH research funding, families like Abby’s are speaking out to protect the future of critical treatments their children rely on. 

When Abby was just two years old, her family noticed rashes appearing on her face and hands—an early warning sign of something more serious. Not long after, a tick bite led to a high fever and an emergency hospital stay where she was treated for suspected Rocky Mountain spotted fever. During that time, a vigilant pediatric oncologist, brought in to rule out leukemia, recognized the rashes as a possible sign of juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), a rare and serious autoimmune disease. That moment changed Abby’s life.

Thanks to the early suspicion and referral to a rheumatologist, Abby was diagnosed with JDM quickly. Some families aren't as fortunate—many experience delays in diagnosis because JDM is rare and often mistaken for something else if the clinician isn’t familiar with it. That early diagnosis gave Abby a head start in managing her condition and accessing the care she needed.

She began treatment right away, starting with steroids and methotrexate, and later adding IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin), a therapy that helps regulate the immune system. Abby’s case has always involved mild muscle weakness, but her treatment journey hasn’t been easy. Each time doctors have tried to wean her off IVIG, her symptoms flare, requiring her to restart medications and adjust her care plan. Most recently, after a hopeful taper last fall, signs of a flare have brought her back to more intensive treatment.

Despite the ups and downs, Abby is a joyful, resilient kid. While she doesn't have the stamina for sports, she thrives in her own way. She loves reading and lights up on stage during her acting classes, where she gets to express herself in new and creative ways.

Abby will be sharing her story at this year’s *Walk Strong to Cure JM* event in Reno on Sunday, April 27, from 9:00 AM – 12:00 PM, at Sparks Marina Park, helping raise crucial dollars and hope for kids living with juvenile myositis. Her voice represents the strength and spirit of many children who are facing a difficult diagnosis with courage and determination.

Support is more urgent than ever. Recent federal budget cuts have eliminated key NIH research positions, putting lifesaving JM research and promising clinical trials, like a new steroid-sparing treatment, at serious risk. Without urgent funding, progress will stall. By participating in Cure JM events and fundraising efforts, the Reno community can help close the gap, accelerate treatment breakthroughs, and bring lasting hope to kids like Abby.

Come walk alongside Abby and other Reno-area families in support of children battling juvenile myositis. Your participation shows these brave children that their community stands with them! Every step brings us closer to better treatments and one day, a cure.

Enjoy a morning of connection and fun with doctors and researchers from Renown Children’s Hospital, along with coffee, snacks, raffle, and activities for the whole family.

I sighed for what seemed like the hundredth time as I looked out the train window at the grey, flat, bleak landscape outside, my head swaying slightly against the rain-lashed glass as the carriage gently rocked side to side. I had been travelling for over five hours from Durham, and the time had allowed me another painful session of introspection at just what in God’s name I thought I was doing with my life.

It was a stupid, foolish decision that had marred my best years of youth with the weight of things long dead. I was twenty-eight, nowhere near the end of my life, but it sure as hell felt like it as I thought back on the events that led me to taking a train ride across the length of the country to some forsaken seaside town in the southeast of England. I had squandered years of parties, nights out and untold fun by choosing to do a Bachelor’s in Classics at Oxford. My parents had been so proud the day I got into one of the most prestigious universities in the world, completely overlooking the fact that their son had chosen a degree that would lead him to literally nowhere.

My first years at university were not what I had envisioned. In the Classics department, there were no parties or events or mixers, or anything of the sort. The type of people who chose Classics were already old by the time they reached adulthood, living fossils hidden by their youthful exterior. I made few friends, barely acquaintances now, ten years later. I had resolved to change my luck by applying for a Master’s degree at Cambridge, but my poor decision-making skills had once again led me down a path of little reward. I had decided to study at the Faculty of Divinity, an overly lofty name for a school that specialised in taking the more interesting aspects of (primarily Christian) religion and poisoning it with academic misery. I learned a lot, sure, but to what end? I wasn’t even religious myself, despite my mother being a devout Church of England follower. I got that from my dad, for sure. He was a man of logic and rational thought, no doubt it’s what led him to become a family doctor at a clinic in my hometown of Leeds. He hadn’t reacted well to my choice to go to Cambridge. For days after I had told him, he’d lecture me on trying to find something useful to study or to maybe even retrain and do another Bachelor’s in something like Economics or Law. You know, *real* subjects. Yet something in me made me stick to my decision out of spite, leading me to where I am now: on a train, going to a lonely town on the very tip of the country.

I hadn’t wanted to go into archaeology at first, not until I had met Professor Stewart Landry. He was a giant in the field, intelligent, surprisingly charismatic, and seemed to be genuinely passionate about uncovering the secrets of the past. He was very much one of those people who believed that the past could teach us about where we were going in the future, as a society. I hate to say it, but at the time, I believed him. And so, against yet more protesting from my father, I applied for the PhD programme in Durham. I had been assigned to Professor Landry’s research party as soon as I joined, specialising in both pre-Christian Britain and Anglo-Saxon faith. With my background in Cambridge, he said that I’d be a perfect fit for his team. I use the word *team* very generously here. It was myself and one other student called Mitchell, who I can honestly say is the very vision of what I never wanted to become as a man. Skinny, devoid of any character besides his work, and kind of rat-like.

I had resolved not long after joining that I would be leaving the programme, but all those plans had been put on hold the day I received an email from Prof. Landry last week, detailing an urgent summons to the small town of Whitport on the Kent coast. I stopped staring out the window and opened my laptop, scanning over the email again for any small details I needed to remember. If we had missed anything, it was too late to turn back now.

*Hello Matthew,*

*Hope you had a pleasant Easter break. Do anything nice? I won’t beat around the bush, something very exciting is in the works. I’m sure you may have heard about the unfortunate cliff collapse in Whitport that happened over the weekend, just terrible stuff. What’s interesting is that I received an email from one Ms. Margaret Wright of the Whitport Historical Society the day after it happened. It turns out, they found something in the collapse that might be of great interest to us. Apparently, the old chapel of St. Mary was heavily damaged, but Ms. Wright claims that the disaster has unearthed a section of the chapel no one knew existed!*

*She’s asked me to come review the findings, as the chapel dates back to the tenth century. I’m asking for you to accompany me to Whitport next week so we can survey the ruins and see what they’ve found. This would be an amazing opportunity to form the basis of a new thesis for your own studies too, as well as get us out the office for a few days. I’ll head to Whitport ahead of you to meet with the Historical Society on the Wednesday, but if you could bring the bag with the new brushes, trowels, and the small and large photo scales on the Friday, that would be most helpful.*

*I’ve put us up in a B&B on the coast, not far from the collapse site. Don’t worry, the locals assure me that section of the cliff is safe. Shouldn’t take us more than a few days. I’ll send you the accommodation details on WhatsApp when I get the chance.*

*Best regards,*

*Stewart.*

 

And so, here I am, on the fast train to the southeast coast with a duffle bag full of tools and another of my belongings, wishing I was literally anywhere else in the world.

I pulled into Whitport in the early evening. It was still raining when I stepped off onto a sad looking station platform, bracketed by a hideous bridge made from that nasty gravelly stone that seems to have been all the rage in post-war Britain. A couple people stepped off with me, but none of them paid each other heed as they all scurried over to a small gate to the left of the station building leading out to the street. The station was on a small hill, giving me a slightly elevated view of the town that was to be my home for the next few days. Whitport didn’t look as dismal as I expected, but the weather certainly didn’t help to improve the image. From the station I could see two pubs side by side (one of which was creatively named *The Railway Tavern*, top marks for whoever named that one.) I thought about heading into one of them before going to the B&B, but my body groaned and ached from a full day of travel. It’s amazing how tired you can feel when sitting down for ninety percent of your day. There was a tiny taxi office just down from the hill, and so I plodded towards it, making sure to keep the bag with the equipment secure on my shoulder. The office was poorly lit and spartan on the inside, with a pair of moth-eaten chairs in front of a simple desk. The man behind it looked like he had died back in the nineties yet stubbornly refused to give in to the grave. He was short, fat and balding. Exactly the type of person I expected to find in a place like this. When he spoke, it was like the final breath of ten thousand spent cigarettes wheezing as one.

“Evenin’, what can I do ya for?”

“Um, I’m looking to get a cab to the uhh…” I checked my WhatsApp messages from Stewart. “To the Beach House B&B on uh, Priory Road?”

“Ah yeah. Gotcha mate,” he turned to a room in the back and yelled so loud and suddenly I jumped. “Oi Gary! Punter ‘ere for ya!” A skinny man with skin as sallow and yellowed as the wallpaper came out in a shirt stained with God knows what.

“Yeah, come with me, mate. Where you ‘eadin’?”

The taxi drive wasn’t long at all, and I realised I could have easily walked the route myself. Gary, my illustrious chauffeur, was sadly, a talker. While the drive was scarcely ten minutes, he had somehow managed to say more words than all Dickens novels combined in that time, going on about where I’m from, what brought me to Whitport, along with more than a few veiled comments about me being a “posh toff” for going to Oxbridge. I responded with the bare minimum. Looking back, I could have asked him about the collapse, was he there when it happened, was anyone hurt etc. But I just couldn’t be bothered to even attempt to muster the level of interest or courtesy to ask.

The B&B was grander than I expected. A great big Victorian house down a quiet road with a sea view. As Gary drove off, I looked up at the end of the street. Where I would normally see the sea during the day, at night there was only a vast expanse of black out into the beyond. It was strangely intimidating, made all the more so by the single streetlight that sputtered at the end of the road. I turned away and made my way up the steps to the house, noting the quaint little sign showing a faded image of a blue beach hut. The air smelled of salt and something else unidentifiable. I wrinkled my nose as I took it in, a pungent sour scent that felt like a mix of overripe fruit and something pickled. I knocked twice and rang the bell, readjusting my bags and taking in the details of the large front door. It was definitely Victorian, with red and green stained glass bordering the chipped painted white door. It opened, flooding a warm light out onto the doorstep and myself, where a short, almost spherical woman greeted me.

“Oh, you must be the professor’s boy! Come in, come in, I’m Judy Carter, let me help you with your bags.”

“Oh no, that’s not–”

“My husband Brian is in the living room with your professor.” She’d already picked up the duffle with my belongings before I could say another word. “He’s very clever that man. The professor, not my husband,” she laughed before I even registered what she’d said. “All over our heads, I’m afraid. I’m not one for all that smart talk. Where is it you’ve come from again?” Her cheeks were red and rosy, and her voice clearly showed that she had burned through several packs of cigarettes a day back in her youth.

“Durham.” I replied, stepping inside the warm, surprisingly spacious hallway. It really was a beautiful house, with authentic diamond tiles on the floor and original fixtures on the doorframes and staircase. The sour salty air outside had been replaced by the smell of tea and something smoky. The central heating seemed to be on full blast, making me feel almost dizzy as the cold rain on my shoulders evaporated off in an instant.

“Oh, that’s a long way. Had an aunt up that way in Middlesbrough. Your room is on the first floor, end of the hall. Bathroom is straight ahead at the top of the stairs. Me and Brian are on the top floor to the left. Just give us a shout if you need anything.”

“Thank you,” I said as I followed Judy to where I’d be staying. The room was small but very cosy, facing the street below with the yawning blackness of the sea to the left. The room was decorated with a litany of cliched seaside memorabilia, seashells, a model boat, paintings of seagulls. It was so tailored to out-of-towners I half expected a *Live, Laugh, Love* placard hanging above my bed. “I’ll head downstairs in a minute.”

Judy shuffled off, leaving me to unpack. For a moment I just sat there on the bed looking out into the rainy night beyond. A streetlight stood directly outside the house, giving me a clear view of the shadowed streets as they glistened in the artificial glow. It was a little eerie, I thought, how everything beyond the circle of light seemed to melt away into darkness. I could barely make out the pointed shapes of the neighbouring houses, which seemed strange. It wasn’t until after I turned to unpack that I realised that not one of the other homes in the street had any lights on. I don’t know why, but that realisation compelled me to shut the curtains immediately.

I came downstairs to find the door to the living room was ajar, warm yellow light spilling into the hallway like butter over toast. I hovered for a moment, unsure if I should knock or just walk in. Judy hadn’t said whether I should make myself known or wait to be summoned like some Victorian butler. But then I heard Stewart’s laugh—deep and rich and maddeningly confident—and decided I was too tired to be awkward.

“Ah, there he is!” Professor Landry exclaimed the moment I stepped inside, as though he’d conjured me with his voice. He was sitting in a high-backed armchair that looked like it had never once left this room, a cup of tea in one hand and a biscuit perched daintily on the saucer. The other occupant, presumably Brian, gave me a small nod from the sofa. He had the look of a man who had retired ten years ago and hadn’t changed his jumper since.

“Long trip?” Stewart asked, and I just nodded, too tired to complain again. “Sit down, sit down. Have a biscuit. Judy’s homemade. Dangerous things, mind you—eat three and your blood sugar spikes to medieval levels.”

I sat down, and the armchair sighed under my weight. It was ludicrously comfortable, and for a brief moment I considered falling asleep right there in front of them.

“So,” I said, more to keep myself conscious than anything else, “what’s this amazing discovery? Or are you going to make me wait until morning like some kind of academic sadist?”

Stewart grinned. “Straight to the point. I like it. Well, I won’t give you everything just yet—consider it a little incentive to not bail on me and head back to Durham. But yes, it’s genuine. Margaret was right. The collapse exposed a lower crypt beneath the chapel, sealed off by rubble and soil for… well, we’re still dating it, but likely since the High Middle Ages. Maybe earlier. Romanesque stonework. Anglo-Saxon patterns on some of the capitals. And something else.”

The way he said that last bit made me look up. “Something else?”

He leaned forward, lowering his voice like he was telling me a dirty secret. “An object. A kind of… disc. Stone, about three feet wide. Set into the floor. Black glass at the centre. Very old. Very strange.”

My skin prickled. Not from excitement, but from that ancient little voice in the back of my head that occasionally warns you when something’s off. The kind of thing that tells you not to go into the dark room, even if the light switch is right there.

“That’s all I’m saying tonight,” he added, smug as anything. “We’ll go see it tomorrow morning. Site’s been sealed up for the night, and Margaret has the keys. You’ll meet her too. She’s quite the character.”

I didn’t press. I knew that look in his eyes. He was enjoying this too much to spoil the game. So I took a biscuit and let the taste of lemon and ginger pull me back into the room, pretending—for the moment—that I wasn’t suddenly aware of how very far from home I was. I retired to my room as midnight approached. There was only so much of Stewart’s overenthusiasm I could take in an evening. The room creaked softly as I moved. *Old timber bones*, I told myself nothing sinister. But I found myself glancing toward the curtains more than once, wondering if I’d imagined that strange darkness outside. The absence of light in the other houses. The stillness.

Maybe it was just the rain.

 

My arrival into the next morning was heralded by the sharp, needle-like tone of my alarm. I groaned as I turned it off, glancing at the time. 5:30. It was still dark outside. The effort to force myself to the bathroom to shower would have put Hercules to shame, but I managed to bring myself beneath the warm water, washing the cobwebs of the previous night away. Stewart was already downstairs in the kitchen when I descended, chatting in that annoyingly chipper way of his to Judy, who was busying herself at the stove over a pan of bacon and eggs. The smell seemed to revive me fully, and I must admit, the breakfast was very pleasant indeed. I had barely touched my coffee to my lips when Stewart dived right into the business of the day.

“So, Matthew. We’ve been granted access to the collapse site until midday. Margaret said she’ll meet us there at 6:30, so finish up quickly and grab the tool bag. It’s going to be an exciting morning!”

“Why only till midday?” I asked as I forced down the mug of bitter instant coffee.

“Well, they need the time for cleanup. The emergency services still need to stabilise the surrounding buildings and to carry on getting the rubble out. We won’t be alone, though. Margaret and the rest of the Historical Society will be there to help with cataloguing and note taking. They’ve even given us a shovel.”

“Lucky us.”

He hadn’t noticed the sarcasm in my voice, or had at least chosen to ignore it. “Now, I’d best get my supplies. Don’t dawdle, lad.”

We left soon afterwards, the first signs of the sun straining above the overcast horizon. In the daylight, the street didn’t look nearly as creepy—just quiet, like it was holding its breath. The houses here were a mix of the old Victorian dwellings like the Carters’, as well as more modern red-brick terraces built during the Sixties and Seventies, but everything still seemed so grey. We took the most direct route to the collapse, along the clifftop promenade at the end of the road to the right, the colourless sea to our left. I looked over the railings, spying an empty beach strewn with dark seaweed far out across the flats.

“Low tide by the look of it,” Stewart said, almost reading my mind. “Good thing too, makes our job much easier without the sea coming in.” Seagulls moaned and called out across the windy air, the breeze carrying with it that same sour-salty scent I had noticed the night before. Despite the grey streets and Stewart’s endless chatter, I couldn’t shake the weight in my stomach. Excitement? Dread? Maybe just the coffee.

As we approached the seafront, I noticed how the buildings seemed to get much older. Nearly everything here was from the mid-Victorian era by the look of them: painted white and once-bright colours that had been faded to pastels by the sea air over many years. Peeling paint, blank windows, and water-stained signs gave each one the look of a forgotten relic from a colder, wetter decade. One of the most distinctive features, however, were the remains of what looked like more modern structures sticking out of the ocean like the bones of a long dead monster. Thanks to the low tide, I saw the remains of a modern road that ran into the sea, no doubt reclaimed over years of climate change and other such calamities. We passed a rundown looking old fashioned arcade, the type of place where kids in the Nineties and early 2000s would spend their days before the true age of the Internet began. Unbelievably, it still looked to be operating. *Maybe the Internet hasn’t reached Whitport yet.*

We turned up a steep hill away from the half-submerged road, arriving at a trio of pubs that straddled a small junction, each more decrepit looking than the last: *The Narwhal, Triton’s Cove* and the *King James*. The road followed up to a large church hall to our right, made entirely out of flint, and to our left, the reason why we were here. I had never seen a disaster site before, but this was beyond anything I expected. Just passed the *King James*, several roadblocks had been erected in front of a large police van, parked across the width of the street. Despite the early hour, the entire junction was thick with people. Police officers, fire fighters, town officials, and no doubt the Historical Society, were all crawling in front of the police van, around twenty in all. I stumbled my way awkwardly through the crowd as I followed Stewart, careful not to nudge anyone with my duffle as I watched him raise a hand to a short woman in a bright parka coat who seemed oddly cheerful for someone standing at the edge of a crater

“Margaret! Pleasure to see you again!”

“Professor Landry! Pleasure’s all mine! Come, come.” The pair shook hands as Margaret led him over to a small pop-up table covered in notes and files. As I approached, I got my first glimpse of the scale of the disaster. Peering behind the police van, I saw that the black tarmac was cracked and buckled in such a way that the surface rippled like waves frozen mid-motion. Looking up, I saw the striking image of the front of St Mary’s Chapel still standing, now nothing but a flint façade against a cloudy, uncaring sky. The roof had disappeared, leaving a bare window hole overlooking the torn road. I couldn’t see the pit from where I was, and my curiosity was interrupted by Stewart’s voice ringing in my ears.

“Ms. Wright, allow me to introduce Matthew Rhodes, one of my finest students and assistants. He’ll be helping me with my research whilst I’m here, so I’m sure you’ll get well acquainted.”

I had to look downwards to meet Margaret’s gaze, her big brown eyes blinked behind a thick pair of glasses. She must have been in her sixties at least, and her wild frizzy hair had been tamed with a makeshift ponytail.

“Absolute pleasure to meet you Matthew! I’m Margaret, head of the Whitport Historical Society, but you can call me Maggie if it suits.” She shook my hand with surprising firmness. I kind of stammered in response, not really saying any real words. Her big eyes looked me up and down, making me feel a tad uncomfortable. While I didn’t mind female attention, there was something so off-putting about it coming from someone old enough to be my mother. I cleared my throat and started over.

“Pleased to meet you, uh, Maggie.”

“Oh, he’s a handsome one isn’t he?” she remarked, her voice carrying into the air with a little too much emphasis. I shifted uncomfortably, my stomach churning with embarrassment. She seemed completely unaware of my discomfort, a trait I was quickly becoming familiar with. “Come now, I was just telling Professor Landry about what we’ve detailed so far. We weren’t able to get access to the site until yesterday, so there isn’t much to go on I’m afraid.”

Despite Maggie’s comment, there were a copious amount of notes and papers detailing the Historical Society’s findings, along with a plethora of photographs, both polaroid and those open on a laptop that sat at the head of the table. As I set the bag of supplies down, my initial discomfort slowly ebbed away, replaced by growing curiosity. I wasn’t able to make out much of Maggie’s chicken-scratch handwriting, but the photos were most intriguing to me. There were over forty in total, but those focusing on the structural features of this ‘hidden vault’ caught my attention immediately. Stewart had been right; the stonework was definitely reminiscent of other Romanesque churches across the world. The pillars, although aged and in terrible condition, were similar to the spiralling coiled designs of the cloister of the Lateran Basilica in Rome, yet they seemed to have a number of embellishments that I didn’t recognise. They looked almost… organic. The way the carvings spiralled, as if the stone had grown rather than been carved, gave them an eerie, tentacular appearance. They seemed to mimic the form of deep-sea creatures – an octopus, perhaps?

The arches seemed to be made from the same flint as the chapel exterior, apparently quite common for churches in and around Whitport. But the pillar capitals seemed to be made of a strange, glossy black stone that I didn’t recognise, carved with undoubtedly Anglo-Saxon motifs. They were faded, but the camera had been able to make out some fine details of what looked like holy figures standing in a line or a procession, their forms worn but still oddly dignified. One of them, barely distinguishable, seemed to carry a staff topped with something like a flame—or perhaps a wing. Despite my conscious misgivings about my career path, I couldn’t deny how deeply this fascinated me. There was something here—something buried and forgotten. And maybe, just maybe, worth the debt and disillusionment.

“Interesting, really interesting” I said, turning to Maggie and Stewart as if to reassure them that I *did*, in fact, want to be there in some capacity.

“That it is, for sure.” Stewart remarked, a wide grin bursting beneath his moustache. “But that’s not the best part. Have a look at this.” He uncovered a set of five polaroids from the piles and set them before me.

This was undoubtedly what he had mentioned last night. As I scanned the images, my eyes were met with what looked to be a large circular design etched into the broken floor of the vault, now exposed to the open air. The stone was comparatively clear to the rest of the ruins, with the carvings upon the surface much clearer and easier to identify. The ring of stone was around a metre wide, as Stewart had said, etched with writing in both Latin and what I guessed to be Old English, below which were carving of the same holy figures as on the pillars. Their garb suggested them to be monks of some kind, their hands raised in prayer save for the figure at the head of the line, who held a tall staff topped with flame, like a great torch. At the centre of the disc, there was a large black stone, broken almost perfectly in half by the great crack that cleaved the disc in two.

“This is the glass you mentioned?” I asked, pointing to the last image.

“Exactly, my boy. At least, we think it’s glass. We haven’t removed anything from the site yet for analysis. Which,” he hefted his supply bag with a satisfied grunt, “is why we’re here. Let’s go, time’s a-wasting.”",1,1745376776.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

So I (24F) share an apartment with my roommate ""Jenny"" (26F). We've lived together for about a year and generally get along fine. Jenny has this cat named Oscar that she adopted about 3 months ago. The cat is cute but pretty hyperactive and knocks stuff over all the time.

I work from home as a graphic designer, and I have a pretty expensive laptop ($2200) that I need for my job. I've told Jenny multiple times that her cat keeps jumping on my desk and knocking things over, and asked her to please keep him out of my room during the day when I'm working.

Yesterday I got up to use the bathroom and left my workspace for literally 5 minutes. I didn't close my door because I was coming right back. When I returned, Oscar had knocked over my full coffee mug DIRECTLY onto my laptop. The laptop is completely fried. I have some work backed up but lost a project that's due next week that I've been working on for DAYS.

I told Jenny that she needs to pay for a replacement laptop since her cat destroyed mine after I've repeatedly asked her to keep him out of my room. She FLIPPED OUT saying it was my fault for leaving my coffee next to my laptop and my door open. She said she's ""not responsible for what her cat does"" and that I should have been more careful with my expensive equipment.

I told her she's 100% responsible for what her pet does - that's what pet ownership is. If her cat destroys something, she's liable for it. She called me an asshole and said I'm trying to scam her out of money for a ""laptop upgrade"" (wtf? I just want the same model replaced).

My other friend thinks I'm being too harsh and that it was partially my fault for leaving my door open knowing the cat roams free. But I feel like she should be responsible for controlling her pet, especially after I've brought this up as an issue before.",2,1745376749.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1k5osgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/1k5osgp/theory_hotel_reverie_is_a_stealth_sequel_to_uss/,[THEORY] “Hotel Reverie” is a stealth sequel to USS Callister — Clara is a digital clone of Dorothy created from her DNA.,"Okay hear me out. I just watched Hotel Reverie from Black Mirror Season 7, and something clicked. This isn’t just a meta critique on acting or Hollywood—it’s a spiritual and technological successor to “USS Callister.” And I think Clara is a conscious digital clone of Dorothy, made without her consent, using leftover DNA—just like the crew of the Callister.

Let’s dive in.

The DNA Tech We Saw in USS Callister
In USS Callister, Robert Daly created digital clones of real people by collecting small traces of DNA—like lollipops, hair, or a coffee cup. Those clones were 100% conscious—they had memories, emotions, and personalities.

After Daly’s downfall, the company behind the Infinity game likely shut down, got absorbed, or restructured. But what happens to groundbreaking tech like that? In true Black Mirror fashion: it gets rebranded.

ReDream = Infinity’s Successor?
Enter ReDream, the “immersive film” platform from Hotel Reverie. Their tech lets actors enter a film and interact with AI-generated characters. But here’s the twist:

Clara, the woman Brandy acts alongside, is too real.
She hesitates, questions the script, and even seems emotionally affected when Brandy calls her “Dorothy.”
She doesn’t freeze like the other characters when the narrative breaks. She adapts. She feels.
This isn’t standard AI behavior. This is consciousness.

So… what happened?
My theory: ReDream found or retained Dorothy’s DNA. Maybe from an old hairbrush, lipstick, or costume she left behind. And without her permission, they used it to create Clara—a digital replica of her original self. That’s why Clara is the only one in the simulation that feels like a real person. Because she is. She’s a clone of the original Dorothy, now repurposed as an eternal actress.

Clara is essentially the Shania clone from “Joan Is Awful” meets the crew from “USS Callister”—sentient, exploited, and trapped.

The Horror Beneath the Glamour
Dorothy walked away from Hollywood.
But ReDream didn’t walk away from Dorothy.
They kept a piece of her, digitized it, and kept her working—even if it was just her ghost.
Clara is starting to remember who she is. And that’s why she’s the only one still “alive” in the simulation.
TL;DR
Clara isn’t an AI—she’s Dorothy.
ReDream used leftover DNA and tech descended from Infinity (USS Callister) to make her.
She’s the only one in the film simulation with a soul, because she’s the only one that used to be human.
Hotel Reverie is the quiet, terrifying continuation of USS Callister—and nobody noticed.
Let me know what you all think. Anyone else spot this? Did I miss something?",0,1745376498.0,blackmirror,0,0.33,False

1k5oqqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1k5oqqq/i_miss_my_mom/,I miss my mom,"Growing up, my father was an abusive alcoholic and I watched him berate, scream, fight and beat my mom. I’ve seen him get arrested countless times and my mom always took him back. My mom hardly worked and had no financial stability or backbone and felt trapped in her marriage. We went to a battered women’s shelter when I was 8, but went back to my father after a few days. This cycle kept continuing until I was able to move out and took my mom and younger sister in to live with me.

We would see him on birthdays here and there were low contact for then next 5 years until unfortunate circumstances and poor decisions led us back to him. I would help out financially and did everything for my family. I ended up getting engaged and moved out, but was guilted by my family because I was supposed to take care of them. My younger sister who is abusive told me I abandoned them and tried to talk me out of leaving and said it was my fault she was back in my father’s home.

I was just tired of carrying everyone’s weight and wanted to do something for myself

December 2023 I went no contact with my sister. She is a copy of my dad and hits us, spits on us, manipulates and lies to get her way. She is a vile human being and I couldn’t take her toxicity anymore.

My father told me I needed to repair my relationship with her cause I’m the oldest and it was my job. Last March he got drunk and called my fiance threatening to kill him and his family. I blocked him and haven’t seen him since and I haven’t thought twice about it.

My mom is stuck in the middle of them and is terrified to see me. She won’t leave the house to meet me somewhere for coffee and if does she has to lie and say she went to a doctor’s appointment. I talk to her every week and that helps but I’ve only seen her 5 times in the last year and we live 10 minutes away. She’d lied to my sister and told her we aren’t speaking, and well she found out that wasn’t the case and pushed her on the ground causing her arm to bruise. My mom refuses to call the police because she is tired of it.

I can’t help but feel extremely guilty and ashamed. My mom, sister and I had a really strong bond from all the trauma we endured that it feels like I am grieving people who have died. It’s been extremely difficult for me and I’ve suffered panic attacks from it. I do feel like abandoned them and I know it would be easier to give in and break no contact than it is to keep doing this.

I am getting married in May and my mom can’t come because of they found out all hell would break loose. I don’t want to pressure her and put her in a tough spot. I miss her very much. She wants me to reach out to my dad so it’s easier for her to see me, but I am tired of sacrificing for the comfort of others

I haven’t been able to accept this is what it is and keep hoping for things to change. I wish my mom was stronger and saved us from this years and years ago or that she was able to financially care for herself so she can be free to do what she wants

We are moving out of state in June because my fiance got a really good job offer, and I feel like I will never see my mom again. Even if we were to visit, I don’t know if she would be able to see me without backlash. I feel like it was my responsibility to save her, she confided in me at really young age and I’ve felt like the parent ever since.

I know she’s had a hard life but the burden and pain I’ve felt has caused me so much anxiety that it causes me to spiral and hyperventilate.

I just wanted to vent and hope anyone can offer any insight, thank you in advance",1,1745376351.0,EstrangedAdultChild,0,1.0,False

We both love coffee so much and it's indeed a useful and thoughtful gift, more for me than him. The thing is, we don't live together. So everytime somebody needs it, the other has to bring it to one's house. I'm aware that this setup is odd.


I think the fault is in me for not being able to communicate better but one day, I really wanted good coffee to start my day before work, but since he has it and he was still asleep, I chose not to bother him. He woke up late in the afternoon and I was already irritable at that fact, even though I've had coffee some other way. I work 2 jobs (from home) while he doesn't have one, just side hustles 1-3x a month, yet lives comfortably, plus he has a car. He does a lot of acts of service for me such as fixing broken stuff around my house, cooking, driving me around, etc which I appreciate so much because I barely have free time on weekdays due to work. But again, I errupted at the part that we had to share the coffee maker in 2 separate houses, which then escalated to why we're still not married or even living together after 7 years of being in a relationship - a fight that we've had a few times in the past, and a topic that makes him defensive if brought up in anger.


I told him he can have the coffee maker for himself. He used to come over everyday but he hasn't come over in more than a week now. He still texts to let me know when he's awake and going to sleep, but I've lost the will to engage. I forget we're fighting when I'm swamped at work, but when I'm not I can't help but feel a slow rage building because of the lack of effort to fix things. I know he isn't busy at all. I guess he's lost the will, too. He still has the coffee maker. Today's our anniversary.


I'm think I'm too proud, disappointed, frustrated, and clouded to analyze our current situation. Can somebody help me take a look at where we are and what next steps I should do? Pls don't be too harsh :(",1,1745376096.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I've known they wanted me out ever since I complained about harassment. But they couldn't get rid of me because that would be retaliation. Now I feel like they are creating a paper trail to manage me out.

There was a mention of PIP: ""I don't want to put you on PIP."" The main complaint was time management (fair), careless mistakes (we can thank ADHD and running out of Bupropion or simply forgetting to take them and people stress there) and communication skills. I don't see how a PIP will improve any of this because my issue is not a lack of skill - it's communication and a lack of concentration. And really I don't share my personal life and am not particularly friendly - lol ok PIP.

In our team calls, I don't talk much. I just say what I'm currently working on. My super-manager thinks I do nothing. Most of my team are not graphic designers. If I told them what I'm doing, it will be like me speaking in an unintelligible language.

I've known I should look for a new job ever since I complained. I just wanted to fix my mental health before I took on that new stress. Returning to normalcy is taking far longer than I thought it would. Im still on meds - over a year now (tapering down though now).

And I really *really* don't want to give up wfh. That will be hard to find in new jobs.

I worry my lack of concentration and forgetting words is a change that will stay - brain damage from extended unresolved B, D and iron deficiencies and 3 cycles of depression. Probably C too since I often get cravings for oranges.

I notice an immediate drop in performance whenever I forget to take Bupropion - I make mistakes and miss things and forget more. Its making me reluctant to get off that med. Coffee does help but Bupropion does a much better job. I probably should get tested for both ADHD and autism so that I can get on ADHD meds. But I think my doc had been waiting for me to get off meds for the testing. He did that with my bro.

I never noticed my carelessness and forgetfulness before or it didn't exist before 2023's shitshow. Idk. But it is veeeery noticeable whenever I forget to take my meds.

I realized my actual issue today about not wanting to talk about the review yesterday with my mother when she asked. I prefer writing out my feelings, than talking about them. Writing seems to force my thoughts in order and speaking makes my mind go blank and that makes me uncomfortable.

My mother is jealous that I prefer to talk to literally any random person on the internet about my stuff rather than talking to her. She's rather critical in general - so really it's her fault. But the thing is I type on the internet. I don't speak.

Why are my rants always so matter-of-fact? I don't think I have ever posted an angry rant here. I have in a women's subs. Idk my posts are catered to subs' general communication styles. Yay more masking.

This is more stream of consciousness rather than a rant. But its making me feel better.",1,1745375942.0,Schizoid,0,0.6,False
1k5olg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BadBosses/comments/1k5olg6/boss_threatened_to_steal_my_notary_stamp_i_need/,"Boss threatened to steal my notary stamp, I need to remind her that's illegal","So, it's been a wild few months for me. I work in banking, not looking to get fired(yet) and would like to keep options in the field open so as much as I'd love to name and shame, I have to wait until my current office is far in the rear view. 

Everything started about 6 months ago when I requested disability accommodations at work, really simple things like having a postit note on my monitor to remind me to do a task, 5 minutes to take my medication in the morning, scheduled time to do outreach calls. Real simple stuff I've gotten approved at every other job I've worked for no problem, including in banking. I've never even had to request these kinds of accommodations before they were just given. Not here, my boss decided to fight these accommodations tooth an nail. She even retaliated by steaming my office supplies so I couldn't have not paper at all. If I so much as pulled out a notepad I got screeched at from across the office. 

And then she started writing me up. She's falsified dozens of reports, documentation, write ups, etc. She forbid my coworkers to talk to me and for me to talk the them. She even threatened to throw out the coffee machine just to spite me for liking to take my medication with coffee. Real batshit stuff. The worst part being her claiming to have found my notary stamp and journal unsecured while i was on vacation. Complete BS and i have the records in my journal proving where it was at that time because i performed charity notarizations while i was out. I've worked with people with disabilities my whole life, I know textbook retaliation and discrimination when I see it, I was documenting everything with quotes, witnesses, camera positions, exact times and I went to HR who took almost 4 months ""investigating"" only to have looked at all of the evidence and decided the cameras were just a little too blurry to really say for sure and other bs. Notary records, mean nothing. Me carrying my journal out of the office when I left for vacation in full view of 5 cameras isn't enough because it was in its security bag and they apparently aren't smart enough at HR to have the object permanence needed to see my journal go into the bag, on camera, and know it's still in that bag when I leave, on camera the whole time.

Around January I did my last hail Mary and sent all of my concerns and evidence to her boss directly this time. Some things got done like time to take my medication. When I asked for a letter explaining why they denied all of my other accommodations which they are legally required to give, I'm told they actually can't give me a letter about that because they ""didn't deny my accommodations, we just didn't grant them."" My direct and explicit evidence backed examples of her falsifying company records all conveniently were ignored or given some kind of cover lie. Particularly where she reported my 2024 performance metrics, each of which was only half to a third of their actual values which i have access to through our commission statements. 

For about 2ish months she seemed to back off after. But the last week she's been going off her rocker again. Today she saw my notary security bag and decided to take issue with it saying it wasn't secure enough and went on a tangent about how my notary supplies and commission belong to the company and she has a right to demand when and how I keep them, and to even take them if she feels. This is illegal, extremely so. So tomorrow I get to send her boss another email explaining the threats and statements she's made and professionally tell him that if she so much as moves looks at my security bag(which is NNA approved and provided by the company for us to keep btw) the wrong way, I'm going to need to follow the response outlined in our states notary handbook and company procedures. This involves me filing a police report on the theft, notifying the secretary of the state that my employer has stolen my notary journal, and filing a compromised data report with our company's internal forms. I wonder if anything will get done this time.

To help her family out of financial difficulties, Cynthia Bonilla married Misael Schaefer, a rich but blind man.After the wedding, Misael swapped his exquisite tuxedo for a plain white shirt and black trousers.His appearance remained a mystery, absent from rich lists.Rumor had it that he was hideous.But in reality, he was quite handsome, standing over 1.9 meters tall.""Let me help you,"" Cynthia offered, aware that he relied on touch to navigate.She stood up slowly, trying to walk over.""No need,"" Misael replied curtly, keeping his distance with a cold face.""The Sloans are cunning indeed. They know I'm blind, so they sent a pathetic pawn instead of the heiress,"" he sneered.Feeling a pang of guilt, Cynthia lowered her head. The pure white wedding dress stung her eyes.She hadn't wanted this, but the Sloans forced her into this with their four years of care. She just had no choice.""You didn't want this either, right?"" Misael asked, shifting his attention to her.Cynthia looked up, caught off guard. ""Yeah, but it wasn't up to me.""""Well, at least you're honest. That's something,"" he scoffed.""Doesn't matter, though. Whether it's you or Clarissa, it makes no difference.""To him, it was just a marriage of convenience. There had never been anything between him and Clarissa Sloan, though people said she was better-looking.He was never the type to fall for a woman for her looks alone.""What's your name?"" Misael asked.""Cynthia,"" she replied softly.""How long have you been adopted by the Sloans?""""Four years.""""Why did they take you in?""She hesitated, then decided to tell the truth.There was no point hiding it; powerful families like his could dig up anything they wanted.""My grandpa had saved Clarissa's grandpa's life. To return the favor, he promised to let his grandson marry me.""""Oh, so you were Leonel's fiancée before? He was okay with our marriage?"" Misael sneered.""He never wanted me. I know my place,"" Cynthia replied.""How old are you?"" he probed.Misael moved to the sofa in the master bedroom and sat down, probably worn out from standing too long.""22.""""Still in school?"" he went on.After a long pause, Cynthia answered, ""I've never been to school.""""What? Never? Don't tell me you didn't even go to kindergarten.""Feeling embarrassed, she fidgeted with the hem of her dress. ""No.""""Oh, isn't that something?"" Misael said, clearly taken aback.""Never expected my wife would be an illiterate. How ridiculous!""Cynthia had had enough. She stood up, took a deep breath, and shot back, ""You don't have to be so mean. I married you at the Sloans' command. Your family agreed to the swap, didn't they? I guess they know not many girls would want a blind husband.""If you're that unhappy, we can call it quits right now. Draft the divorce papers, and I'll go.""""You think that's an option for you?"" Misael asked with a slight frown.""You think you've got better options?"" she fired back, plucking up her courage.Silence stretched between them.Then Misael broke it with a sharp laugh.""You may not have much education, but you sure got a sharp tongue.""Cynthia stayed quiet. She had only agreed to the marriage to get out from under the Sloan family's roof. But he wasn't wrong—divorce wasn't an option. Not yet, at least, not until she found what she was looking for.""You take the bed. I'll crash on the sofa."" Misael was being considerate, though his tone was commanding.""No need. This is your house. I'll take the sofa."" Cynthia stood up slowly, the crystal tiara on her head giving a faint jingle.""Suit yourself. I'm gonna take a shower."" He got up and felt his way toward the bathroom.After a moment of hesitation, Cynthia asked, ""Do you need help?""Her offer came from concern, but Misael took it differently.""Oh? Sure. How exactly do you plan to help?"" he teased, his tone suggestive.She caught the meaning and flushed. Thankfully, he couldn't see it, or he might have laughed at her.""I'm just worried you'll trip or something and I'll get blamed. That's all. Don't get the wrong idea,"" she blurted.""Then how about you bathe me?"" Misael pressed further.""Sure. If you're okay with that,"" she replied, unflinching.""Alright, come on in.""She froze in surprise, unsure what to do.""You can still back out, you know.""Misael chuckled, sensing her hesitation. ""There are consequences for acting tough,"" he thought.Finally, she said, ""No, I've handled tougher things than this. Let's do it.""Cynthia wasn't much of a talker. Her stubborn streak earned her plenty of scolding from her grandpa since she was a child.""It's just a bath. Don't be scared. He's not gonna try anything,"" she told herself.She followed Misael into the bathroom, leaving the door ajar just in case.""Are you gonna help me undress, or you want me to do it?""Misael's question made Cynthia cringe.Now she realized he was just messing with her.Her face hardened as she replied coolly, ""Mr. Schaefer, you're blind, but your hands work just fine, right?""""Fair enough. I'll do it myself."" Then Misael took off his jacket and shirt, revealing his toned upper body with eight-pack abs.Cynthia quickly turned her head away, her cheeks burning red.Noticing her reaction, Misael smirked. ""Get the water temperature right for me, then you can leave.""The earlier suggestion was just a joke.Misael had kept his distance from women for years. Surely he wouldn't let her bathe him.Relieved by his words, Cynthia turned away and bent over the bathtub to adjust the water.In her haste, she bumped into his foot as he stepped into the tub. Then they both tumbled into the bathtub with a loud splash.Cynthia ended up sprawled over him, her hand pressed firmly against his chest.""Mr. Schaefer, your mom asked me to bring you some soup,"" a maid called out.She stopped at the bathroom door, the scene making her jaw drop.""Oh no! Mr. and Mrs. Schaefer, I'm so sorry. I didn't know.""With that, the maid set the tray on the coffee table and bolted.An awkward silence followed.""How long are you planning to stay like this?"" Misael frowned, his tone dripped with sarcasm. ""Didn't you say you didn't wanna marry me? What? Feeling you made the right decision after seeing my abs?""Cynthia rolled her eyes. ""Don't flatter yourself. Sure, you've got abs, but who knows? It's probably a letdown where it really counts.""She tried to pull her hand away, but Misael grabbed her wrist.""You're the first person ever to mock me. Well, want me to prove you wrong right now?""""Let me go! Wait.""In her struggle, Cynthia's fingers brushed against his arm, and something felt off.""Misael, are you sure the car accident caused your blindness?"" she asked, her brows knitted.Misael, sharp as ever, caught the suspicion in her voice. ""What are you implying?""Chapter 2 Second Opinion""I've learned a bit of traditional medicine. I just checked your pulse. Something seems off,"" Cynthia explained.""Didn't you say you never went to school?"" Misael asked, his frown deepening. He had always been suspicious.""I didn't. I learned it on my own while living with my grandpa in the mountains.""""So your grandfather is a traditional doctor?""""He was self-taught too.""""Why wasn't he at our wedding?""""He passed away.""""Oh.""His response was blunt, with no hint of sympathy, but Cynthia let it slide. She just continued, ""Back to your condition, that's just what I feel, believe or not.""""Go on,"" he said.""Mind if I check your pulse again, just to be sure?""Misael didn't say anything, just let her go, and held out his arm.Cynthia sat up and leaned over to take his pulse.She wasn't one to be easily tempted, but being this close to him was unsettling.He looked far more striking in person than in any photo she had seen on TV.Cynthia had heard about Misael and seen those photos during her time with the Sloan family.His family's reputation was impossible to ignore—one of Acriastein's most powerful dynasties.A month ago, Misael visited the Sloan family with engagement gifts.Cynthia wasn't allowed to join the table, but she watched from a distance.The way he carried himself impressed her, though he couldn't get a clear look at his face.Now, with him right in front of her, she found herself unable to look away.""Enjoying it?"" Misael asked sharply. ""If you're done, maybe check my pulse?""Cynthia looked away and closed her eyes to steady herself.Then she pressed her fingers to his strong wrist.Her cool touch sent a faint tingle through him.""The other hand,"" she said softly.""Seriously?"" he grumbled but did as she said.After a moment, Cynthia got slowly to her feet.""So what's the deal?"" Misael asked calmly.""You've been poisoned,"" Cynthia replied.""What?"" That possibility had never crossed his mind.""I'm not a proper doctor,"" she added. ""And no fancy credentials. I'm just speaking from experience. So you don't have to take my word for it.""""Alright, keep going.""""Your pulse tells me that, and it happened less than two weeks ago. It's still active, which is why I can feel it right away.""""What kind of poison?"" Misael asked, curious.""Methanol. Have you been drinking any rotgut lately?""Her words made him chuckle.""Rotgut? Me? Do I look like the kind of guy who'd do that?""""Just saying what I think. Never mind,"" Cynthia huffed.Frustrated by his attitude, she stood abruptly and turned to go.""Wait,"" Misael called out.She stopped and turned around. ""What now?""""If you're really here to help, I'll make sure you're repaid properly. But if you're up to no good, you'll regret it.""That set her off.""Mr. Schaefer, let me remind you. You've been rude since day one.""And for the record, paranoia is a thing. Maybe book yourself a shrink when you get the chance!""With that, she slammed the door behind her.Since losing his sight, his hearing had grown sharper. Misael winced as the bang echoed in his ears.He used to have a fiery temper; any woman acting like this would have been out the door.But now, he held back. There were bigger things to deal with.He grabbed his phone and made a call. ""Get me the autopsy report on the truck driver from the crash. And schedule a full checkup for tomorrow. Bring in some specialists.""Misael stayed in the bathroom for a bit. By the time he came out, Cynthia was already asleep on the bed.He paused, listening to the sound of his even breathing. ""Sleeping like a rock after all that happened,"" he muttered to himself.With a smirk, he stretched out on the sofa and drifted into a light sleep.The next morning, Cynthia woke to find Misael already dressed and sitting motionless on the sofa.The soup from the day before remained untouched, exactly where the maid had left it.Still groggy, she said in a husky voice, ""Morning.""""You're up. Get ready for breakfast,"" he said, his face expressionless.""Okay.""""And put on something nice. We're going downstairs to greet the elders.""""Got it,"" Cynthia replied.She was already bracing for the hassle ahead. Family traditions were always a pain, and even the Sloan family, with their second-tier status, managed to make them theatrical.Clarissa's charm and wit had won over Misael's mother, Madisyn.Without that, the Sloan family would have had no chance at this marriage. Women across the city had been eager to marry Misael.Meanwhile, the Sloan family had been struggling financially for a few years.The Schaefer family's generous offer was just Leonel's lifeline.But in the end, it was Cynthia who made the sacrifice, not Clarissa.Cynthia opened her modest suitcase and took out a light red dress.Without the tiara, she felt freer and lighter.She tied her hair into a ponytail and looked like the lively girl she once was.Downstairs, their families were already gathered around the big rectangular dining table.Cynthia glanced their way as she guided him carefully down the staircase.""They're coming,"" Madisyn said with a bright smile.The newlyweds greeted everyone politely.Natalie Schaefer, in her eighties, brimmed with energy and couldn't hide her joy at seeing her only grandson married.Before she could speak, Misael's aunt Alicia sneered, ""Misael's married an impostor. Shouldn't we reconsider the price?""Alicia stayed sharp-tongued and meddlesome, even after marrying out of the family years ago.Misael's uncle Lamont chimed in, ""They're out of line. The car accident left him blind, fine, but accidents happen. Sending an impostor? That's a real insult to our family.""Their remarks made Cynthia feel out of place. She clenched the hem of her dress, trying to stay composed, but the sting of humiliation was hard to ignore.With a sharp clang, Misael slammed his fork on the table.""Why didn't you guys say this yesterday?""The wedding's done, and the papers are signed. Isn't it a little late now?""If you'd brought it up earlier, I'd think you were calling out the Sloan family.""Now it just feels like you're giving me a hard time.""Alicia exchanged a glance with Lamont and said softly, ""Misael, that's not what I meant. Come on, we're family. I just thought you might feel bad. Even your mom said Clarissa's prettier than Cynthia.""She knew exactly what she was doing. That seemingly innocent explanation just gave Madisyn away.Chapter 3 Get His Sight BackCynthia didn't turn heads the way Clarissa did—Madisyn had said that before.But it was so rude to blurt it out in front of Cynthia.Madisyn gave an awkward smile. ""That's not true. Cynth is pretty too. Come on, both of them are.""""Alright, enough already,"" Natalie snapped. ""Do you seriously have to start this crap so early? Cynthia and Misael are not here for this. Just give them their wedding gifts and shut it.""Natalie only cared about Misael's happiness. It didn't matter to her who he married, as long as he cared for the girl.With a warm smile, Natalie studied Cynthia. ""Cynth is lovely. Look at her round face. She's gonna bring good luck to the family. I like her.""With an elegant gift in hand, she continued warmly, ""Here, this is for you.""Cynthia hesitated, glancing at Misael. Seeing his calm expression, she took it as approval and accepted the gift. ""Thank you, Grandma.""With Natalie backing her up, the room quieted down. Then the rest of the family began handing over their gifts.They were far friendlier than the Sloan family. Breakfast was relaxed, filled with chatter. No one singled out Cynthia or stirred up trouble.After breakfast, Misael headed out.Cynthia went back to the bedroom to catch up on sleep.When she woke up, he was already back.He was sitting quietly on the sofa.""Oh, hey,"" she called out.""Check this out,"" Misael said, pointing to a pile of gift-wrapped packages on the floor.""What's all this?"" she asked curiously.""Clothes, a phone, and a bag.""Cynthia stared in surprise. She was about to ask why he had bought them when he cut her off with a dry tone.""How do you not have a phone in this day and age?""""I don't go to school and have no friends,"" she muttered, eyes fixed on the floor. ""What would I even need one for?""""How did the Sloan family treat you, really? They let you stay for four years.""But they couldn't even get you a phone or proper clothes.""She stayed silent. He was telling the truth.Cynthia had mixed feelings about the Sloan family. The past four years had been calm, but she had mostly stayed out of sight. Sometimes, she even ate with the housekeepers.They never sent her to school, and barely anyone outside the house knew she was the adopted daughter. Her life might have stayed that way if Clarissa hadn't refused to marry Misael.Even Misael had only just learned of Cynthia's existence.He hadn't seen her face yet, but from her voice alone, he figured she was probably plain-looking.""Why are you giving me all these?"" she asked.""Because I don't want you making me look bad,"" he answered.Cynthia rolled her eyes.""My wife shouldn't look pathetic. Just take them. They'll help you at least look the part.""""Thanks."" She wasn't one to turn down kindness out of pride.So she went over, crouched down, and carefully unwrapped the items.Among them was a brand-new pink phone, the latest model.No girl could resist such a charming shade. If Misael hadn't been blind, he might have noticed her eyes light up with joy.The clothes and designer bag didn't excite her.Having grown up in the remote mountains with her grandfather until she turned eighteen, she wasn't drawn to such things. But a phone—she had secretly wished for one for years.But a phone was something she had quietly wished for over the years.Preston Sloan had once suggested giving Cynthia his old phone, but his wife, Kaylynn, had dismissed the idea outright.Whether it was jealousy or something else, Kaylynn said Cynthia didn't need a phone since she had no friends or job.And that was the end of it. Back there, her basic needs were met, but she had never had money of her own. She couldn't work without their permission, and even if she could, her lack of education made it impossible.Even her favorite herbs were left behind.Cynthia held the phone in both hands, feeling overjoyed. She stared at it for a long moment.Misael's voice broke the silence. ""Cynthia, if the poison is methanol, can you cure me?""She turned to look at him.""Everything comes at a price. I knew it. Of course, he expects something in return,"" she thought.""Doctors already told you methanol poisoning causes irreversible damage, didn't they?"" she said calmly.""They did,"" he replied.Earlier, he had visited his private hospital and consulted some top specialists.They confirmed Cynthia's diagnosis and told him the damage to his eyes was permanent.Misael had spent the day stewing in frustration. Back home, he waited in the room for Cynthia to wake, holding onto a faint hope.""So, it really is methanol?"" Cynthia asked.""Yeah,"" he said.""Misael, I've never done clinical trials. Everything I know, I learned from my grandfather. I've never treated anyone for this before. But if you're willing to trust me, I'll give it my best shot,"" she said earnestly.""What do you think my chances are?"" he asked.""I can't say.""""What?"" Disappointment hit him like a blow.She was his last hope, but she couldn't promise anything.""I can't guarantee I'll fix your eyes, but I can try.""""So, I'm just a guinea pig to you?""""Pretty much,"" Cynthia replied, unfazed.Misael's temper flared. He grabbed the new phone and smashed it to the ground. ""Cynthia, do you take me for a fool? I can end you right away if I want to.""""Mr. Schaefer, I didn't poison you or cause the car accident. Let's not forget the facts,"" Cynthia said calmly.The room went stiflingly quiet.Misael had always been proud, volatile, and sharp-edged.Cynthia, on the other hand, was steady and unshaken, never letting her composure falter.Fate brought these two opposites together in a strange twist.""If this treatment doesn't work, am I at risk?"" Misael asked. Somehow, he had managed to set his anger aside.""No. The worst that could happen is you'll stay blind, just like you are now.""""Alright, let's get started right away.""A week without sight was driving him mad; everything felt impossible to do on his own.All he wanted was to see again.""I'll need some herbs,"" Cynthia said.""Fine, write them down, and I'll have someone get them,"" he urged.""You can't find them on the market.""""What do you mean? Are you kidding me?"" he said, frowning again.""Listen, they grow wild in the mountains. They're unnamed plants I can't describe. If it's possible, you can have someone take me there. My old home has the tools I need to make the medicine. It'd be faster that way.""""OK, let's go.""On the second day of their marriage, Misael called it their honeymoon, and they left for Mount Wonderland, Cynthia's hometown.It was just over a hundred kilometers away. By the third day, when they returned, his eyes were fully recovered. What a miracle!That night, in a hut on Mount Wonderland, Misael took the antidote. Within minutes, he opened his eyes slowly, and everything came back into view.""How is it? Can you see now?"" Cynthia asked, cautiously waving her fingers before his eyes.Without a word, Misael pulled her into his arms.When their eyes met, a wave of admiration surged through him.""You can see, right?"" she asked, her voice rising with excitement.Chapter 4 Visiting the Sloan FamilyMisael didn't rush home to share the news of the recovery.Instead, he honored the tradition by visiting the Sloan family.On the way back, Misael made a stop at the city's best shopping mall.He picked out new outfits and hired a stylist for Cynthia.After the makeover, she stared at the mirror, barely recognizing herself.""Mr. Schaefer, are you happy with the look?"" the stylist asked confidently.Misael lounged on the sofa behind her, legs crossed, a cigarette resting between his fingers.He brought it to his lips and demanded, ""Turn around.""Cynthia turned slowly, her head lowered, a hint of shyness in her movements.She had spent eighteen years with her grandfather in the mountains, rarely meeting other people.After moving into the Sloan's home, she barely got noticed and hardly ever went out.And she wasn't even given Clarissa's discarded clothes.The shift from being an unnoticed plain girl to this was just breathtaking.Misael had seen more impressive things and thought he was ready for this, but her transformation still stunned him.For years, he avoided romance, crossing paths with plenty of bombshells, but none came close to Cynthia.The idea that she was less attractive than Clarissa had always hinged on Clarissa's use of makeup and cosmetic tricks to enhance her appearance.Cynthia kept things simple, but with her naturally striking features, a bit of styling turned her into a showstopper.""Yeah, that works. Go ahead and use my card,"" Misael said with a nod.Obviously, he liked the look. Then he handed over a sleek black card from his wallet.Her hair was styled into two braids with subtle detailing.She wore a cocktail dress that fell just below her knees, and its soft color perfectly complemented her skin.For the first time, Cynthia wore jewelry—a delicate pearl necklace with matching earrings.On her left hand was the wedding ring.She didn't know much about diamonds, but she'd heard that size mattered when it came to their worth.Even with a simple wedding, no expense had been spared for Cynthia.Under the soft light, the huge diamond on her ring gleamed.She looked up, meeting Misael's gaze.Then, she turned away without a word.""Cynthia, Leonel never tried anything with you over these four years?"" Misael asked.He wasn't sure why he brought it up. His sharp gaze stayed on her as he waited for an answer.Cynthia was annoyed and thought, ""He should thank me for the treatment, not asking this.""She turned to meet his eyes and shot back, ""If he had, do you think you'd be here now?""Misael glanced at her angry face and couldn't help but chuckle.He was over the moon about his recovery and let her sharp words slide.They arrived at the Sloan's house at noon.The Sloan family was stunned into silence as they saw Misael move around freely.""Misael... you can see again?"" Leonel asked in disbelief.Misael took his time to scan the room and relish their shock.Then he took Cynthia's hand and said, ""Yeah, it's all thanks to Cynthia. She's my lucky star. The day she became my wife, my sight came back.""Clarissa's face fell immediately. The Sloan-Schaefer union had always been about alliances, but she had secretly hoped to marry Misael.With his looks and status unmatched in Acriastein, being his wife meant having everyone's attention and respect.Clarissa thought no one deserved this more than her.But after Misael became blind, Clarissa didn't hesitate to move on.Her wedding was held on the same day as Misael and Cynthia's. But it was grand and lavish.""This can't be real. How could he get his sight back so fast?"" Clarissa thought.She was overwhelmed with anger, disbelief, and sadness.""Misael, how did your eyesight recover?"" she asked, her tone overly sweet as if she cared.To her disappointment, Misael looked down at Cynthia's hand and kissed it gently.What a display of affection. Cynthia knew it was all for show, but the blush on her cheeks gave her away.""I just slept and woke up to find I could see again,"" Misael said casually.""No way,"" Leonel muttered, doubt written all over his face as he glanced between Misael and Cynthia.His eyes lingered on her face for a moment.Back when Cynthia moved in, Leonel barely paid her any attention, dismissing her as a country bumpkin.She usually ate with the housekeepers, so he rarely saw her at meals.Leonel and Clarissa spent their nights partying and clubbing, always sleeping past noon.Leonel often traveled for work, managing the family business with his father.The engagement between him and Cynthia was forgotten after those who created it passed away.And there was nothing legal to hold it together.Now, sitting beside Misael, Cynthia looked completely different.Leonel was struck by how stunning she looked.If he had noticed this before, he would have made her his and never let her end up with someone else.Regret churned in Leonel's and Clarissa's chests.This was exactly the reaction Misael had hoped for by coming today.""Guys, dinner's ready. Chat while we eat,"" Preston said, trying to ease the tension in the room.Throughout the meal, Preston kept putting food on Misael's plate, steering the conversation toward lighter topics.""Cynthia, could you get me some soup?"" Kaylynn asked.It was an excuse to get Cynthia out of the room.Cynthia grabbed a bowl and headed to the kitchen.As soon as she was out of sight, Kaylynn shot Clarissa a meaningful look.Clarissa leaned closer to Misael and whispered, ""Misael, you should go for a check-up at the hospital.""Let's not take any chances.""Kaylynn chimed in smoothly, ""She's right. When you had the accident, she cried so hard she almost passed out. It's a shame you two missed each other.""Misael smirked. ""Oh, really? She just married someone else the very next day.""""Misael, I hate to bring this up, but Seamus McGee set me up. He spiked my drink at the bachelor party. I didn't have a choice,"" Clarissa said, tears welling up in her eyes.""And we owed Cynthia's grandpa a lot. My parents believed in doing the right thing and wanted the best for her. Letting her marry you was how they chose to repay that debt.""""Well, you all are certainly kind and grateful,"" Misael said with a half-smile.""A promise from the older generation carries weight. It's something we have to honor,"" Preston replied, trying to hide his guilt.""Interesting,"" Misael scoffed. ""Because the promise I heard was for Cynthia to marry Leonel. But when he wasn't interested, you passed her off to me instead. Using me to pay off your family debt? Brilliant move, huh?""His words hit hard, leaving the family visibly uneasy.Desperate, Clarissa tried to turn things against Cynthia. ""That's not true, Misael. Cynthia wanted this. When she found out I was engaged to you, she got jealous. Then she used the accident with Seamus to push us into this arrangement. We only agreed to protect your family's reputation. If you're unhappy, you can just divorce her, kick her out, because she's—""""Because she's got no one in the world, right?"" Misael cut her off and glared at her.Cynthia walked back in with the bowl of soup and placed it in front of Kaylynn. ""Here's your soup.""""Thanks, sweetheart,"" Kaylynn said, her voice dripping with fake warmth.Leonel gave Cynthia a thoughtful look, and a lousy idea crossed his mind.""Mr. Schaefer, if you're unhappy, you can always send her back. We looked after her for years. We don't mind doing it again.""""Don't be ridiculous. She's my wife. Sending her back here would make us the talk of the town. Besides, you're not her real family,"" Misael shot back.""If we hadn't taken her in, she'd have ended up on the streets. She wouldn't have the comfort she has now,"" Leonel said defensively.""Oh, right. Four years under your roof—and no phone, no school? That's some 'comfort.'""The family of three froze, wondering if Cynthia had told Misael that.""Even housekeepers get paid, don't they? What have you guys given her?"" Misael added with an unreadable smile.""Cynthia, tell us. How did we treat you?"" Leonel asked, his eyes fixed on her.""Be honest, Cynthia. It's okay,"" Kaylynn said, giving her a warning look.""Yeah, Cynthia, tell Mr. Schaefer how it was. Nothing but truth,"" Preston added, looking nervous.All eyes were on her now. She glanced at Misael, seeking a sense of security.Chapter 5 She's GorgeousCynthia gave a faint smile. ""Everyone has been great to me. Otherwise, they wouldn't have given me such a good opportunity to marry Mr. Schaefer. I'm truly grateful.""Cynthia's answer was impeccable, yet it was a slap in the face to the Sloan family.Because everyone knew the only reason Cynthia got to marry Misael was that Clarissa didn't want to.When Clarissa heard that Misael had gone blind in a car accident, she did everything she could to avoid marrying him. She even went as far as having a one-night stand with the son of a real estate tycoon, Seamus, and made sure it was photographed and made public.It was only because Clarissa rejected him that Cynthia ended up with Misael.But on the surface, no one could tear off the polite masks just yet. And they couldn't even tell whether Cynthia's words were genuine or sarcastic.Misael smiled, ""I'm grateful too. If Cynth hadn't come into my life, my eyes wouldn't have been cured.""""Misael..."" Clarissa was pissed that she had actually let such a good opportunity slip.If she had known Misael's eyes would recover this quickly, she would never have married that loser Seamus!""Clarissa, the way you address me is inappropriate."" Misael gave her a cold glance.""Come on, let's eat, everyone.""Preston cut in, covering for his daughter's inappropriate thoughts.""Cynth, why don't you stay the night with Mr. Schaefer? We've prepared a room for you two,"" Kaylynn offered enthusiastically, clearly with an agenda.""Kaylynn, I—"" Cynthia was just about to decline.""Sure, no problem. We'll stay the night,"" Misael answered smoothly.Cynthia gave him a quick look, surprised. His expression revealed nothing.Cynthia had been glad to get away from this family. She'd rather stay at the Schaefer's residence.But Misael had already made the decision. There was no changing it now.After dinner, Kaylynn had the maid prepare a guest room, even swapping in high-end bedding before letting them in. Once inside, Misael glanced around.""This isn't your old room, is it?""""No.""""Thought so. They'd never give you a room this nice.""""I'm used to it. It doesn't matter where I sleep,"" Cynthia replied calmly.Sitting on the big bed, Misael looked at Cynthia's delicate face. ""You talk back to me sharp as a blade, so you don't seem like someone who'd suffer silently. Tell me, Ms. Bonilla, do you have a hidden side I don't know about? Or maybe secrets no one else knows?""""Misael, stop with the sarcasm. If you've got something to say, just spit it out.""""Haha. You were so sweet and docile in front of the Sloan family, but in front of me, you're a little wildcat. I like wildcats better.""His words made Cynthia's cheeks flush again.""I don't have time for your nonsense. Are you using the bathroom or not? I'm going to shower.""Misael silently gestured for her to go ahead.Cynthia turned and entered the bathroom, starting to remove her makeup. She really wasn't used to being this dressed up.Sitting in the walk-in closet connected to the bathroom, Cynthia slowly removed her earrings, deep in thought.She'd been in the Sloan family for four years and still hadn't found the orb.Would Misael help her?After all, she'd healed his eyes, and that meant he owed her big time.But Misael was extremely suspicious by nature. He was way harder to deal with than Leonel.How could she convince him to help without making him suspect anything?After her shower, Cynthia realized awkwardly that she had no clothes there.Left with no choice, she wrapped herself in a bathrobe and tiptoed back to her old room to see if she had any old clothes left.Unexpectedly, she was blocked at the door by Leonel.""What are you doing?"" a familiar voice sounded from behind.""I'm looking for my clothes."" She pointed to the room she used to live.Leonel didn't say anything, looking Cynthia up and down.Wearing a bathrobe and with her makeup removed, she somehow looked even more dazzling.It was strange, really. Cynthia had been living in the Sloan's house for four years, right under his nose.But today was the first time he realized she was this beautiful.Even more beautiful than any of the flings he'd had over the past few years.Now, Cynthia was in a white bathrobe, her long hair still damp.Her bare face was refreshing and delicate. He couldn't take his eyes off her.In that instant, Leonel came to a conclusion: During those four years, Cynthia had deliberately downplayed her looks, avoiding him, maybe even guarding herself against him.Thinking that, he took a step forward to test his theory.Sure enough, Cynthia immediately stepped back.""Cynth, are you afraid of me?"" Leonel's voice took on a seductive tone.Even his voice had become husky and charming. It was nothing like how he used to talk to her.In fact, in the past four years, he'd never once called her Cynth.""Not at all. You're overthinking.""""Then why did you dodge?""""I just think men and women should keep a respectful distance. Besides, I'm already Misael's wife. It's best you maintain some boundaries.""""Cynth, I was the one engaged to you."" He leaned in closer, lowering his voice.""So what?"" Cynthia sneered.""I've always been against you marrying Misael. Our family could've called off the engagement. But you know my parents. They wouldn't dare offend the Schaefer family. So you understand the dilemma I was in, right?""""I do,"" Cynthia replied with a smile, gazing at this hypocritical man.""I never wanted you to marry anyone else. Seeing you now makes it even harder for me. Cynth, you were supposed to be my fiancée. I really wanted to protect you.""""It's highly inappropriate for you to say these things now, Mr. Sloan. Where were you three days ago?""Noticing her tone turning confrontational, Leonel narrowed his eyes.Sure enough, this woman had been pretending to be timid and cautious for the past four years.""Do you think now that Misael married you, you've got someone to protect you?""You're just an uneducated woman with no power or connections. Do you really think Misael cares? Or the Schaefer family? You don't actually believe marrying into their family makes you one of them, do you?""""How funny,"" Cynthia fired back. ""Whether my husband cares about me or not has nothing to do with you. If you're delusional, go see a doctor. There's no point in putting on a performance here. I'm not a fan of theater.""""Oh?"" Leonel was provoked.""Let me put it this way—if I were to do something to you right now, Misael wouldn't step in. Because in his eyes, you're worthless.""As he spoke, his hand reached toward Cynthia's shoulder.Cynthia was wondering if she should fight back when a cold voice came from behind them.""Who said I wouldn't step in?""The next second, Leonel was grabbed by strong hands, spun around, and punched hard in the face.Cynthia froze. It was Misael.When had he gotten there? And how much of their conversation had he overheard?Chapter 6 Make Them Divorce""Why the violence, Mr. Schaefer?"" Leonel wiped the blood from his lips, smirking.""Stay away from her. You think trash like you can lay a hand on what's mine?"" Misael shot him an icy glare.""Don't be so tense. I was just joking with Cynth.""""Save the jokes. If you want to keep breathing, stay in your lane. I won't repeat myself.""Misael then grabbed Cynthia's hand. ""Let's go.""""But I haven't found my clothes yet—"" Cynthia protested, remembering why she'd come to her old room.""Forget those rags. They're worthless anyway.""Misael scowled, irritated by the thought of Cynthia's cheap belongings.After Misael took Cynthia away, Leonel leaned against the hallway, lit a cigarette, and chuckled.Inside the room.""Flirting with Leonel is not the smartest move. You know his reputation in Acriastein. Aren't you afraid of catching something?""Cynthia's temper flared. ""When did I flirt with him?!""""You went out in a bathrobe, hair still dripping...""""If you call that flirting, then we have nothing to discuss."" Cynthia stormed into the bathroom to blow dry her hair.Though Misael had stepped in to help her earlier, she felt no gratitude.She could've handled Leonel herself.Besides, saving her didn't give him the right to mock her. His venomous tongue made her angry, and she vowed to keep her distance.After drying her hair, Cynthia was tired.To cure Misael's eyes, they had made a trip back to Mount Wonderland.Traveling a long distance, gathering herbs, and making medicine had drained her.So, she wanted to go to bed early. But when she stepped out, she found Misael already sprawled on the bed, shirtless.The guest room had only one bed and no sofa.""You can sleep on the floor if you want, but there's no extra blanket,"" Misael remarked casually, scrolling through his phone.Cynthia was angry.""Why should I sleep on the floor?!""""I'm not sleeping there either. The cold bothers me,"" Misael replied.""And it doesn't bother me?!""""Then get on the bed. Stop complaining.""""I...""Cynthia gritted her teeth, climbing cautiously onto the bed.She tugged at the blanket.But she yanked too hard, pulling it entirely off Misael.Misael was wearing nothing but briefs.Cynthia immediately turned away, cheeks burning.""What do you want to do with me, Ms. Bonilla?"" he teased.""It was an accident! I just wanted the blanket!""""If you've got needs, I'm free tonight. Happy to oblige.""""Spare me.",1,1745375651.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Maybe that’s what love is; not the fire, not the chaos, but the tenderness of finally being met. *Of being known without needing to be explained*.

You are not near me, and still, I carry you; in the moments before sleep, in the quiet after the world has gone still, in the songs I skip straight to the chorus, in the coffee that never quite tastes as good without your name in the morning. I have never touched your skin, and still, I swear, my hands remember you.

Isn’t that something? To miss what you’ve never had. To ache for someone like they’ve already lived a hundred lifetimes between galaxies. I look at my reflection and see pieces of you in all the places I’ve softened. And yet, I haven’t traced your fingertips. I haven’t mapped your smile with mine. But I love you, fully. Without waiting for permission. Without needing proof. Without condition. 

People don’t understand how distance can hold something so sacred. But you and I? We existed beyond logic. Beyond explanation. You were not an idea. You were not a maybe. You are here, still, in the shape of every word I haven’t written yet, in the pause between my sentences, in the spaces that no longer feel empty.

I love you, still, in a way that has nothing to do with time. Nothing to do with space. Only everything to do with truth. With energy. With gravity. You pulled at something in me I forgot was alive. And I would wait lifetimes for a touch that feels the way your presence always did.

This is not a beginning. This is not an ending. This is a remembering.

*And God — I remember you everywhere*.

1k5oe03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k5oe03/creepy_teacher/,Creepy teacher,"My English teacher (male) has made many girls in my grade very uncomfortable and idk what to do about it. For reference I'm in 10th grade and am 15 turning 16 so it's really weird. It all started when we came into class last school year (I'd be in 9th grade then) and he had us record ourselves doing a play, makes sense for an English class but the problem was he was recording without asking parents permission and not just recording the time we were acting but the whole class. He got called out for it and it was taken to admin but they ended up doing nothing about it. This school year he did it again and this time I made sure to have my mom sign the slip saying I can't be recorded at all unless it's pictures for yearbook, he never asked my mom or my friends mom who has the same paper signed to record and basically did the whole thing again but we write our own scripts and then act them out. We only got to do one script tho and it was my friends who got chosen and she didn't recognize her own story but that's another thing. She knew I didn't feel comfortable being recorded by said teacher so she never called on me to be an actor in his play thingy, while he was recording our class he was also joking about the previous incident where he got caught recording the whole period but nothing got done. We (friend and i) ended up reporting him to admin about it and they said technically they can't do anything. (Idk if this next part would be considered sfw so read at your own risk but I need advice so idk where else to put it) Fast forward to today I came into class without friend and noticed hello kitty drawings on the board there were two but one was of buff hello kitty but she had no sports bra or shirt on.Uncomfortable already. Went the whole period thinking it's fine I can just get through the rest of the day but then he holds me after class so he can talk to me about something. I'm thinking great it's probably about me rolling my eyes in class (he makes kids who audibly yawn write an essay about how disrespectful it is) he tells me I know your feelings about me and this classroom (I've been rolling my eyes and giving attitude in class) you make it very clear.I also want to talk to you about the test you missed. I said what test did I miss? He responds the one from last quarter that u scored 2 points on. ( this was early in the quarter so I still have no idea which test he's talking about) he says I wanted you to know that I wasn't sitting behind you during that test to make sure you weren't cheating or anything I was making myself a cup of coffee (he has a coffee maker in his class) so there was no need for you to answer 2 questions then leave. I responded that's not why I left so quickly. He asks why I did. I said I had prior comintments that day and I wasn't going to wait an hour after school to take a test. He said I wasn't going to make you wait an hour, I said you made me wait 30 mins to even start the test I came in at 1 45 to take the test and you snapped at me and told me to wait till 2 15 to come into class and take the test. He (starting to raise his voice) said I didnt do that. I snapped back with yes you did. Again while he's starting to yell at me said we'll I was going to let you retake it but I guess that opertunity has passed. I said well I didn't want to retake it anyways that was last quarter (grade books are closed from then and I had genuinely forgotten about it) if I had wanted to take it again I would've asked. He started to raise his voice and yap about something like we'll that opportunity has passed but I was going to let you retake it with a bunch more yapping. I had my other class to get to (5 min passing period) and I had a min to get to my next class so I looked at my watch and said are you done because I have other classes to get to. He then got upset that I dare walk out of his class before he was done talking yadda yadda but I just turned around and left. All these things has happened with hin and admin hasn't done anything and doesnt care about student reports so idk whether I should report him again for the topless hello kitty or for the conversation we had when nothing has been getting done about it. But my mom's on my side and wants me to just skip his class but I cant do that cause it's English but idk what to do anymoreAlso when we were doing the play things he was wanting us to write about 8 kids who are friends ans 1 is stealing from the others parents but he also said something to the affect of make it strange and one way you could do that is write about insest, have them all be related and some like each other, maybe even have them kiss because the strangest parts of life is what give it its meaning",1,1745375251.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

After winning yet another lawsuit, Jasmine Black was having a drink with her colleagues at the bar.

She was hammered when she noticed her rival, Diego Cooper, sitting at the opposite table.

Diego was a prominent lawyer worldwide. He was regarded as the industry's formidable devil. He had never once lost a case.

He's also the bastard that Jasmine had pursued from high school until she graduated from university.

She had pursued him for seven long years, yet he remained indifferent and heartless toward her.

Jasmine abruptly sprang up from her seat and staggered toward Diego. With one flop, she sat straight on his lap.

She grabbed his necktie with one hand while resting the other against his toned abs.

""Diego Cooper… Have you become bad in bed?""

Diego didn't stop her as he reclined against the back of the couch. Instead, he stared at her wordlessly.

""You're not answering… So, does that mean… it's true?""

Something flickered in his eyes as he quickly removed her hand.

""Don't you care about your reputation anymore? All your colleagues are here.""

His deep voice was slightly hoarse.

Their colleagues gaped at them in disbelief, impressed by Jasmine's bravery.

""What reputation? I had mine ruined a long time ago because of you!"" a drunk Jasmine grumbled before biting his neck.

All her high school and university classmates knew she spent a lot of money to win Diego's heart, only to fail miserably in the end.

After graduating from university, she was crestfallen and went abroad. She swore she would one day beat Diego in something he was best at.

When she returned to the country six months ago, she was already a famous lawyer with a winning streak dating back to the beginning of her career.

She was beginning to drawl.

While wearing a frown, Diego pulled the back of her collar to create distance between them.

His eyes were dark and indecipherable.

""You've drank too much, Jasmine. Have someone take you home.""

""No! I want you to take me home!""

She yanked his necktie. Her imperative tone sounded slightly coquettish.

He removed her hands from his tie so he could loosen it. Then, he grabbed her by the arm before walking outside without saying a word.

Their colleagues' eyes widened.

Everyone in the legal and political world knew Jasmine and Diego were on bad terms.

They tried to figure out the scene they had just witnessed.

When they reached the car, Jasmine wrapped her arms around Diego's neck and planted a kiss on his neck, sending a slight tremor down his spine.

He held her by the waist and shoved her away.

""This is sexual harassment, Jasmine Black. Do you think I won't sue you for this?""

His tone rose.

""If you're really bad in bed, then forget it. I'll just find someone by the street to release my sexual frustration.""

She then ignored him and waved at a passing man.

""Hey, hot guy! Wanna get a room together?""

Jasmine seemed serious about the invitation.

Diego's expression darkened as he watched her antics. He pressed her waving hand down and opened the car door to shove her in.

Then, he drove the car back home.

…

The next morning, Jasmine woke up and turned her head stiffly.

Diego was sitting next to her, smoking. He appeared laid-back.

Despite his charming looks, he had a dominating and intimidating presence about him.

The grogginess that clouded her mind disappeared in a heartbeat.

Did she finally manage to have sex with him after almost seven years?

""Morning, Mr. Cooper,"" she said.

Jasmine propped herself up, returning to her professional composure as a lawyer.

""Wash up. Someone will serve breakfast in a while.""

Diego discarded his cigarette into the ashtray.

""I'll forgo it. I have a client to meet in the morning.""

Aloofness seeped into her voice.

She lifted the sheets and was about to get out of bed when an idea crossed her mind.

She suddenly grabbed her phone from the headboard, smiling mischievously.

""How about a picture for memory's sake?""

Before Diego could say anything, Jasmine quickly launched the camera app on her phone and lay her head against his sturdy chest.

She flashed a triumphant smile, raised the phone high, and took a selfie of her and Diego.

The picture was rather suggestive as they were naked and were only covered with a blanket.

She sent it to her best friend alongside a voice message.

""Becky Dobbs, tell those people to wire the money to me. I won the bet. Oh, and the payment should include ten years of interest.""

Since she had lost her reputation, she thought she should make some money to make up for it.

The shrewd Diego caught the point of the message.

He asked with a smirk, ""The bet was about me?""

Turning around, she plastered herself to his chest while drawing circles on his abs with her finger. She couldn't resist it.

Jasmine looked at Diego with beady eyes.

""Why are you so surprised? I thought you've known all this while. Oh, and about what happened last night, it was consensual. It was simply an adult game. You don't have to take any responsibility.""

She felt the years she spent pursuing him were a loop of disappointment and heartbreaks. Continuing to be his devoted admirer would be a foolish decision.

Sleeping and then dumping Diego had always been on her wishlist.

""You're wild, Ms. Black.""

Chuckling, he glanced at her and pushed her away.

Due to his handsome looks, a mere glance from him was enough to paralyze her with a tingling sensation.

Jasmine thought Diego was a bastard who was good at seducing.

His push caused her to fall backward, but she managed to support herself with both palms on the bed.

Her tress cascaded over her shoulders, revealing her exposed body and seductive curves.

Jasmine had a stunning body.

Diego's eyes studied her up and down. The fact that his heart skipped a beat made him frown.

""Did you sleep with me because you might like me?""

She casually brushed her slightly curled hair. Picking up her shirt and bra, she began to take her time to dress herself.

""Do you think that's even possible?""

He cast a cold glance at her.

Diego's answer didn't surprise her one bit. Regardless, it didn't bother her because she was determined to be the one who dumped him this time.

Right then, her phone began ringing from the flood of incoming messages. Jasmine checked her phone. They were from Becky.

""Did you really sleep with Mr. Cooper? How? This is too sudden. You failed to take him down in those ten years, though.""

Becky was more excited than Jasmine was.

Smiling, Jasmine quickly replied, ""I'll feed you the details later.""

Diego's phone kept ringing as well. He grabbed it and opened his WhatsApp.

His high school and university group chats exploded with texts.

Everyone was mind-blown by the news.

""Jasmine Black had sex with Diego Cooper?""

Jasmine's body stiffened when she saw the message in the group chat. She didn't expect it to have such a huge impact.

Fortunately, she was close with the people in the group chats. There were only about 30 people in each group, which wasn't many.

She replied to the message, ""It was just a one-night stand. Those who had made a bet with me—you know who you are—wire the money to me.""

Her response elicited a faint smile from Diego, but his eyes reflected coldness as he watched her.

She glimpsed at him—that alone was enough to cause a chill to run down her spine.

""I bet you can't sleep with him for a second time. I'm betting double the amount on this.""

Their university friends copied and pasted the exact message.

The situation was crazy.

""Not only can I sleep with him twice, but thrice. Players, be prepared with your money!"" she texted back with gusto.

Backing off? Not a chance! She'd never do that to embarrass herself.

The smile on Diego's face widened, but he looked like he was going to devour her alive.

His best friend, Jesse Taylor, sent a text message.

""Mr. Cooper sent a lawyer to prison a few days ago. Mark my words—it was a 20-year sentence! Good luck, Ms. Black.""

Jasmine read that message and looked at Diego, who began smoking on the bed again. She couldn't read his emotions because the cloud of smoke covered his features.

Arching her brow, she replied to Jesse, ""Oh really? I'm looking forward to the day when I meet Mr. Cooper in court.""

She then shifted her attention away from the chat, smiling and waving at Diego.

""I should get going, Mr. Cooper. Thanks for the hard work last night. Get some rest.""

Despite his faint smile, Diego suddenly pinched the cigarette between his fingers.

Chapter 2

In the afternoon, Jasmine noticed Diego as soon as she entered the cafe.

The surprise was brief as she immediately wore a professional smile.

""What are the odds, Mr. Cooper?""

""Zero. I'm simply granting your wish.""

Smiling, he placed his cup of coffee on the table before reclining on the couch with his legs crossed.

""Wow… Thank you for your service?""

She gladly took a seat opposite him.

Jasmine's client was a university friend who was also in the group chat they shared.

The case was about a prestigious family in the city that went bankrupt due to internal conflicts.

Diego's expression remained the same. He didn't respond to her remarks either.

""Be a man, Fabian Dawson. We divorced three years ago, and you want half of my money?"" Daisy Freeman, dressed in a sexy red dress, growled at Fabian.

""You've only managed to come this far because of the huge sum of money I spent on you. Don't you even feel guilty about it?"" he questioned.

Fabian needed the money to rise again.

""Why must I—""

Before Daisy could finish her thought, Jasmine crossed her legs and interrupted, ""If you guys think a fight can get you somewhere, what's the use of hiring a lawyer?""

The dispute stopped.

Jasmine looked at Diego indifferently.

""Mr. Cooper, as you know, although it was signed, the divorce agreement won't be effective as long as the divorce procedures have not proceeded. The law states that a divorced couple should split matrimonial assets in half. The same goes for the debts.""

Diego asked, ""Mr. Dawson, is it true that you had an affair while still married and had sex with your mistress many times?""

Fabian smirked and shook his leg, completely unbothered.

Meanwhile, Jasmine turned to look at Fabian in surprise. He hadn't told her any of that.

Fabian blurted, ""Fuck! What kind of man—""

Jasmine gave him a look and averted the question.

""Evidence, Mr. Cooper?""

Jasmine had clearly informed Fabian before this that the conversation would be recorded whenever the lawyers met.

She wondered if he was out of his mind as he almost let this tongue slip.

Daisy huffed, ""I witnessed him get a room with a model.""

""Ms. Freeman, did Mr. Cooper not explain what evidence is?""

Jasmine smiled, relieved at the thought that the other party didn't have proof.

Fabian snorted.

""I have a mistress? You're talking as though you don't have a boy toy. I also wonder how many businessmen you have slept with all these years.""

""It was after we signed the divorce agreement that I—""

Diego glimpsed at the foolish Daisy before interrupting her, ""Please show the evidence before you speak.""

As mentioned at the beginning of the conversation, the divorce agreement was null and void. How could Daisy admit that she had a boy toy?

Was she trying to divorce without getting a single penny out of it? Diego thought Daisy was an idiot.

Jasmine's judging eyes landed on Fabian, who knew that his wife had someone on the side but didn't gather any evidence about it.

She massaged her forehead, fully aware of the road ahead.

Diego questioned, ""Mr. Dawson, you and my client have been living separately for three years. You didn't fulfill your duty as a husband. What have you been doing all these years?""

""I—""

Jasmine shrewdly replied, ""He has been working hard to give Ms. Freeman a better life. However, his legal wife withholds the matrimonial assets. He doesn't have any money while going through a rough patch. Ultimately, his business announced its bankruptcy. If this case is brought to court, don't think of taking a single penny, Mr. Cooper.""

Diego retorted, ""Is this a threat, Ms. Black? His bankruptcy has nothing to do with my client. You can look into it.""

He looked at Daisy, who also didn't share the information with him.

This was the first time he was going against Jasmine at work, and it was a surprising case at that.

""Speaking of, you can also look into this, Mr. Cooper. My client bought his wife multiple houses and luxury cars worth millions of dollars altogether. Ms. Freeman didn't fork up a single penny before and after his business went bankrupt.

""Controlling the matrimonial assets, refusing to pay off shared debts, and having a male companion… Mr. Cooper, you and your client should seriously consider splitting the assets equally or taking this matter to court.""

Jasmine slightly leaned forward, smiling at Diego.

…

""Before the divorce is settled, keep those women at arm's length. Don't give Diego or your wife any other ammunition. Also, eliminate any records, pictures, messages of hotel room bookings, and whatnot,"" Jasmine reminded Fabian while driving the car.

""Got it.""

Fabian was deeply impressed by her.

The thought of meeting Daisy to obtain funds was humiliating to him, but the way Jasmine bombarded the opposing party gave him confidence.

He was all puffed up.

""Is your wife living with her boy toy?"" Jasmine inquired.

""Yeah, it's been three years.""

He crossed his arms, snorting.

""That's good news for us.""

She smirked as she suddenly pulled over by the road.

""Get back home and install a surveillance camera at her place. Tell her that it's to… prevent burglary.""

""I don't think she'll let me in.""

The couple had been living separately for three years. Daisy had bought that mansion herself.

""Idiot! You're still her husband on paper. Is it wrong to return to your home? Plus, she should currently be with Diego.""

""Alright, I'll go now.""

Fabian thought, ""Don't blame me for this, Daisy. I've treated you so well and spent so much money on you. How could you be this cruel to me!""

…

That night, Jasmine received a call from Fabian after she finished showering.

""Diego is going to sue me for bribing him!""

His words came out in a rush.

Jasmine rolled her eyes.

""Well, did you do that?""

""He called me at night and told me he found that model. I was so scared. I met him, hoping he would cut me some slack for old times' sake. I even gave him a check of one million dollars—""

""You idiot! That's a trap! He could bring a woman over and accuse you of having slept with her before, but no one would buy it as long as he doesn't have evidence.

""Oh Lord, someone like you will surely lose everything before you take the divorce case to the courthouse. An idiotic teammate is definitely more harmful than a powerful opponent.""

Jasmine crossed her arms and shook her head.

""Yes, yes, yes, I'm an idiot. You gotta save me, Jasmine! That jerk, Diego, doesn't even care that we were once friends. Gosh, I'm livid!""

""You can be sentenced up to 15 years for bribing a lawyer. It's almost impossible to be announced not guilty of this charge. How am I supposed to help you?""

""W-Well, I don't mind going to prison. But the main thing is, your first loss will be because of Diego! Not only is your reputation at stake, but other lawyers and your friends will never let you live it down!""

Fabian attempted to earn her pity.

Jasmine paced back and forth in her room while reminding him seriously, ""I repeat, do not meet your wife's lawyer without my presence. Think before you speak whenever you talk to her. Don't fall for her schemes. Got it?""

""I'll keep that in mind. But how are you going to—""

He was about to ask her about the possible bribery lawsuit, but the call was terminated.

…

The next morning, Jasmine headed to Cooper, Taylor & Associates.

The receptionist asked, ""Ms. Black, what—""

""I'm Mr. Cooper's girlfriend,"" blurted Jasmine without stopping in her tracks.

The employees were stunned to see her there. Rumors about her and Diego had been circling within the law firm for the past two days.

She read the sign on the door before knocking and opening it without waiting for Diego's signal.

Diego, who was reading some documents, looked up at her expressionlessly.

""Is there anything, Ms. Black?""

He sounded aloof.

Jasmine's hair was let loose over her black professional attire. Her three-inch black high heels were supposed to add more professionalism to her appearance, but it made her look alluring instead.

She walked up next to him before flopping onto his office table seductively. With one hand, she easily grabbed his necktie.

""Giving me the cold treatment already? We just slept together two days ago, though.""

Chapter 3

Diego snatched back his tie from Jasmine's hands while chuckling.

""You must be here because of Fabian's bribery.""

""Of course not. I'm here to… talk about our relationship, not work.""

She pulled at his necktie again, playing with it while faking a smile.

""You want me to sleep with you again? So you can brag about it in the group and rake in big money?""

He slapped her hand away.

He crossed his arms to lean against the back of his chair and arched a brow at her.

Jasmine slid down from the table to sit on his lap. The transition she made was smooth.

Her warm breath brushed against his ears as she giggled.

""Honestly, I was too drunk to remember what happened that night. I kind of want to relive it again…""

Diego's ears turned red. He pushed Jasmine and stared at her. He thought she was shameless.

""Uphold your dignity, Jasmine Black.""

""I've misplaced it. Mind finding it for me?""

Jasmine rested against his chest lazily.

Her finger traced along his perfect neckline.

""I never knew that you were this pretentious, Mr. Cooper. You were so mean that night, as if it was your first time seeing a woman. Why are you pretending to be free from lust now?""

The cheeky movement of her finger gave him a faint jolt of electricity, and he slapped her hand away.

""What are you trying to imply right now? Who was the one who said that it was a mere game so heartlessly that day?""

Jasmine wished she could slap herself—no, Fabian—at this moment. She felt that it was all that idiot's fault.

Had it not been for him, she wouldn't have needed to flatter Diego.

""Why take it to the heart when those were mere heartless words? Since we've slept together, why don't we just date?""

She took shamelessness to a whole new level.

""Sorry, but I don't date heartless people. Torturing myself is not my thing.""

Diego shoved Jasmine off his lap.

Jasmine gnashed her teeth in rage. How dare he claim that dating her was torture!

It took everything in her to build up her reputation and the confidence to stand before him with pride.

But why must she debase herself for him again?

She thought Diego was one merciless and stubborn man.

Given her pretty looks, voluptuous body, elite profession, and background, men lined up to be her partner.

Yet, she had to work hard to wear him down.

She stood up straight and massaged her forehead to regain her cool momentarily.

Then, she made a graceful turn and crossed her arms, smiling.

""Are you sure you want that, jerk?""

Diego ignored her and pressed a button on his landline.

""Callie, come in and escort Ms. Black to make payment.""

He pointed and glanced at the door.

""Ms. Black, I charge ten thousand dollars per consultation hour. Please make the payment outside.""

She nodded before suddenly removing and tossing her black coat onto his table. She strode toward the door while unbuttoning her shirt and ruffling her hair.

""It's only ten thousand dollars. Don't worry. I will pay and ask your secretary to… buy something.""

Diego finally showed traces of uneasiness at her actions. He sprang up from his seat and ran over to the door.

When she opened the door, he quickly slammed it shut again by caging her against it.

His eyelids fluttered at the pleasing view before him, and he looked away.

""Why are you here?""

Jasmine scanned the office, concerned that he would record the conversation secretly. After all, no one knew what he had up his sleeves, considering how cautious he was.

Daisy was at a disadvantage, which was why Diego set Fabian up.

If Jasmine fell for Diego's trap, too, she would lose the case and be sent to prison. She would be the joke of the century if that came to pass.

""I'm here to talk about us.""

She flashed him a smile, attempting to have him wrapped around her finger first.

Right then, the door suddenly opened. Callie turned her head only to see the duo engaged in an intimate scene. Her jaw almost fell to the floor.

Diego, who wielded impactful influence in the political and business worlds, always prioritized work over anything else.

His methods were ruthless and shrewd. Nothing could make him bat an eye, not even a murder.

On the subject of chivalry and love, he didn't have the emotional intelligence for either of those.

Callie couldn't believe what she was witnessing.

""Get out,"" Diego instructed Callie.

""Y-Yes. Don't worry, Mr. Cooper. I saw absolutely nothing.""

Callie covered her eyes.

When he was about to close the door, Jasmine deliberately called out to her.

""Don't leave so quickly. Could you help us buy something we really need right now?""

She gave her a meaningful look.

""Huh?""

The baffled expression on Callie's face gave way to shock and awkwardness once she comprehended the situation.

""S-Sure. I'll go right now.""

She slid out of the door and closed it.

Jasmine chuckled.

""Your secretary is sensible and funny.""

Diego pulled away from her to get her coat. A crease knitted between his brows.

""Enough fooling around. Are you going to leave dressed or naked? If you want the latter, I'm happy to lend you a helping hand.""

""Try me.""

She cocked her brow as she didn't believe Diego's words.

As soon as she finished speaking, Diego threw the coat to one side and stripped her of her shirt.

Before she could react, he pulled her into his arms and trailed his fingers on her back.

Completely flustered, she covered her chest.

""What are you doing, jerk? Do you think you're the only one with guts here?""

She became agitated and caught the secret pin of his belt and pressed it. The belt dangled in midair.

Something dark was churning in his eyes as he stared at her.

Right then, a knock resounded on the door, and the doorknob twisted.

Before the person could open the door, Diego pushed back against it.

""Don't come in!""

He withdrew his hand to wear his belt.

""Get dressed already!""

""I thought you wanted me to leave naked. Why are you stopping me now? Because you don't want others to see?""

Chapter 4

Diego was rendered speechless. He gave Jasmine a cold look before returning to his table to bury himself in the documents, ignoring her.

Jasmine swiftly dressed herself and opened the door to leave.

But Jesse Taylor—their old friend—was holding some documents by the door.

He arched his brows at her.

""Why didn't you let me in? What… were you guys doing in there?""

""Take a guess.""

Jasmine put on a serious face while brushing her hair.

""Did you sleep with him again? I will only pay when I see the proof!""

""Knock on the door at the right time next time.""

She said that intentionally before leaving.

Diego raised his head to watch her leave. Her antics frustrated him.

…

Jasmine returned to her office in the afternoon.

An offer came in. It was a request for her to represent a huge company. She would be paid handsomely for the job.

When the boss left, Fabian, who had been waiting for a long time, immediately entered her office.

""Be honest with me. How much do you earn annually? You have so many clients.""

""Have you installed the surveillance camera?""

Jasmine watered the orchids in her office nonchalantly. She thought it was a bad idea to reveal her income to outsiders.

""I've done it. But Daisy's boy toy hasn't visited her mansion for two days. I bet Diego has reminded her about it.""

""There's no rush in this.""

Jasmine was calm.

""Do you have any solutions to resolve the bribery incident?"" Fabian asked concernedly.

She fell silent.

Diego had the evidence that could prove Fabian's bribery attempt, but he didn't file a lawsuit for it.

She wondered what Diego was up to. Was he trying to play with her more?

If so, she didn't mind joining the game.

""I'll buy us some time for now. Didn't you say that your wife slept with other men?""

""I'm very sure about it. I ran into her a few times when she was having a meal with different businessmen. From the look in their eyes, I knew there was something going on between them. I wouldn't have married her if I had known she was this kind of woman!""

""Hire a reliable private investigator. It'll be best to have pictures of her having an affair with another man,"" Jasmine stated.

With such evidence, she could negotiate with Diego to reclaim the evidence of Fabian's bribery attempt.

If Diego still refuses to compromise, she'd need to see him in court first for the bribery case.

…

Diego and Jesse were enjoying their time in the bar at night.

A woman in a white strap dress showed up. Her makeup was light, and she let her hair loose. She looked stunning.

The woman walked toward them, and Diego noticed.

""What a coincidence! Are you guys here for a drink, too?""

Although there was an empty seat beside Diego, Jasmine chose to sit next to Jesse.

""You look like a doll today… Are you trying to seduce Mr. Cooper again?""

Jesse grinned.

Jasmine ordered a bottle of whiskey from the barista and filled half of her glass with it.

After taking a sip, she deliberately hung her arm over his shoulders with a smile.

""I think you're hot, too. You're also funny and nice.""

Diego glanced at her and took a sip of his drink.

""Jesse, do you know why callous people can appear flirty?""

He looked serious.

Jasmine almost choked over her drink. He was chiding her once again.

She thought he was a jerk for doing so.

""Because they flirt with different people?""

Jesse was flabbergasted.

""Why the question all of a sudden?""

Sometimes, Jesse swore that he couldn't follow Diego's thoughts.

""That's right. We should never stoop to that level.""

Diego's tone remained serious.

Jasmine felt he was being pretentious.

People might have perceived him as a righteous man, but he was rotten on the inside.

She sighed.

""I guess people can stoop that low sometimes.""

She flashed a smile at him while propping her chin on her hand, and he arched his brow in response.

Jesse choked on his drink and spilled alcohol all over.

Her face flushed red. It seemed like she had lost this time.

Agitated, she kicked his shin with her heels and shoved him away.

Then, she walked over to Diego's seat, bending over to lift his chin and bite his lips.

Her posture exerted dominance. It was as if a lady boss was forcing a kiss on her submissive boyfriend.

His expression darkened. He was about to push her away when she pulled herself from him.

She crossed her arms, satisfied with the mark she left on his lips.

""Mr. Cooper, please lay the evidence on the table before you speak. If you spout nonsense, I will have to—""

Halfway through her declaration, he suddenly stood up and towered over her.

Grabbing her by the waist, Diego pinned her against the counter and bit Jasmine's lips back.

She moaned in pain.

Before Jasmine could hit Diego, he withdrew and placed his hands behind his back.

She massaged her hurting waist and touched her lips, which were bleeding because of his bite.

Her opinion of him being a jerk strengthened.

She was so annoyed that she barked a laugh.

""Diego Cooper, I will make you kneel and beg for mercy one day!""

""Is that so?""

He chuckled.

""I swear to God!"" Jasmine waged a challenge.

He smiled faintly while watching her.

A thrilled Jesse was grinning ear-to-ear.

""Holy moly, you're going to make him kneel and beg for mercy? You have guts, Ms. Black! But… I love it! I'm betting ten thousand dollars!""

He would love to see Diego do that. After all, Diego had always been the epitome of arrogance.

Jesse quickly repeated Jasmine's words in the group chat, which sent everyone wild.

Such bliss should be shared for the greater good.

Everyone in the group chat began placing their bets, and her phone kept ringing from the influx of messages.

She checked the notifications and rolled her eyes at Jesse.

""Wow, thanks.""

""My pleasure. The more, the merrier, right?""

He grinned sheepishly while brushing the tip of his nose.

Jasmine filled her glass and downed it all to regain her composure. Then, she headed to the restroom.

Some suspicious men were following her from behind.

When they reached the corridor to the restroom, someone said to her, ""Jasmine Black from Black, Murphy & Associates?""

She spun around and questioned the six sceptical-looking men, ""Who are you working for?""

""That's none of your business. Anyway, someone wants you crippled to ruin your career,"" said the leading man with red hair.

He brandished the metal bar from his shirt and signaled his men to charge at her. They were all holding the same weapon.

""Fuck. You've just underestimated me there.""

Chapter 5

The six suspicious-looking men had approached her at the right time.

Jasmine coincidentally needed to vent her frustrations.

She warmed up her legs before suddenly kicking the red-haired guy, sending him flying and landing on three other men.

A few minutes later, Diego, who also had to use the restroom, noticed a bunch of guys surrounding Jasmine.

An icy, intimidating air emanated from her.

He joined the fray, easily taking down those men with a few punches and kicks. The blows he dealt were clean-cut.

He might appear to be a level-headed and calm person, but his combat skills were fatal.

""Who are you working for?"" Diego interrogated while stepping on one of the men's faces.

""It's…""

The man had an idea and lied, ""It's Mrs. Cannon from Cannon Group! Ms. Black sent her husband to prison, so she wanted us to teach Ms. Black a lesson.""

""Jesse, call the cops.""

Diego kicked the man and approached Jasmine.

""Are you alright?""

A quick-witted Jasmine clutched her abdomen, feigning pain.

""They hit my stomach with a stick. It hurts…""

Diego wordlessly scooped her up and headed outside. Jasmine was very confused.

She wondered if he was worried about her, even though he said she was heartless and kept angering her.

She considered if he was suffering from dissociative identity disorder.

Jesse called to them, ""Hey! Are you leaving so soon? Why am I cleaning up the mess for you guys again?""

However, the ungrateful duo didn't respond to him.

In the car, Diego asked, ""Do you want to go to the hospital?""

Hugging his neck, Jasmine leaned her head to rest on his shoulder. She stifled the urge to grin while continuing her act.

""It's fine. Do you have medicine at home? You can help me tend to my wounds.""

""I'll send you back to your place then.""

He removed her hands so that she could be seated properly.

""No! I want to go to your place!""

She plastered herself to him, whining.

Diego pushed her away and cupped Jasmine's face.

""You said it was a game. Is my place a playground, then? A place you can come and go whenever you want?""

""I wanna go!""

She slapped off his hand and snorted.

She was going to make this man fall for her one day.

…

The next morning, Jesse returned to Diego's office from the police station.

""Did the cops look into it? Was it Mrs. Cannon?"" inquired Diego.

""Not her, but your client, Daisy Freeman.""

Jesse delved his hands into his pockets, smiling.

Diego's expression darkened.

""If Jasmine finds out it's Daisy behind this, she'll surely sue her. So, I called Jasmine and told her it was Mrs. Cannon's doing.""

Diego didn't respond. Instead, he contacted Daisy to arrange a meeting at his office.

After the call ended, Jesse asked, ""Are you still not going to file a lawsuit against Fabian? No one can ever escape from the charges of bribing a lawyer. Besides, if you file the lawsuit now, you won't have to meet Jasmine in court after that.""

""It's none of your business.""

Diego took a sip of his coffee.

""This is not like you. Have you fallen for her after sleeping with her?"" Jesse teased.

""You must be blind,"" Diego retorted.

""Then, why don't you want to close this divorce case as soon as possible?""

""Can't I toy with her for a while longer? Look how arrogant she is.""

As Jasmine had said, this was simply a game. It wouldn't hurt to play along with her, would it?

""Fine. But do not lose the case because of this game. I've seen how Jasmine defended her client in court several times before. She was sharp, quick-witted, and intimidating. She finished asking her questions before the opposing lawyer could react.""

""Do you think that I'll lose to her?""

Diego cocked his brow.

""What if you're blinded by love?""

…

Daisy intentionally chose a tight black dress with a deep neckline to wear to Cooper, Taylor & Associates.

""Mr. Cooper, why did you call for me?""

Her sexy gait carried her to his table.

She had the nerve to rest her hand on his shoulder before sliding it down to his chest.

Her beauty gave her the confidence to take down any man.

Suddenly, Diego stood up and choked her, dragging her all the way to the floor-to-ceiling window.

He was forced half of her body to hang out of the window.

""First of all, I'll cut your hands off if you touch me again. Secondly, I'll send you straight to prison the next time you hire someone to hurt Jasmine. You won't be able to get a single penny out of your divorce!""

Daisy coughed while trying to pry his hand away.

Looking at his menacing expression was already intimidating enough. When she turned her head to gaze down at the dizzying height, fear gripped her.

They were on the 118th floor.

""I-I won't do it again…""

Only then did he lift her up and throw her to a corner.

""You better see to that.""

The heels Daisy wore were so high that she almost lost her balance and fell.

She clenched her fists and tried to regain her composure.

""Why are you taking her side?""

She couldn't help the question.

Diego wiped his hand, which had touched her, with a few pieces of tissue paper.

He spun around, pinning her with his sharp gaze.

""If my reputation is ruined, will you compensate for it?""

Daisy initially assumed that Diego had feelings for Jasmine. It turned out that he was simply trying to defend his reputation.

""Mr. Cooper, are you confident that we can win this case? I don't want to split my assets into half for that guy without a valid reason.""

Over the last two days, Daisy had looked into Jasmine.

Jasmine accepted various high-profile cases. She was even the defense attorney for a death-row prisoner, who was then released without charges.

Diego may be able to send an innocent person to jail, but Jasmine could get a prisoner off death row.

That was why Daisy was worried about seeing Jasmine in court.

""With me, all I ask is whether you want to win or not because I will certainly win it.""

He spared Daisy a cold glance before returning to his seat.

Daisy didn't say anything further and left.

…

Jasmine and her assistant, Addison, were on their way to the courthouse together.

""Ms. Black, don't you think the plaintiff is pitiful? His daughter needs the money to receive treatment. If he loses the case and is unable to receive insurance for compensation, what's gonna happen to her?"" asked Addison.

As Jasmine crossed her legs, she shifted her attention from the documents in her hands to give him a brief look.

1k5odfx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k5odfx,Ocean Moncton-Halifax,"Nothing much, just sharing from some from traveling on the Ocean.

I took the Ocean from Moncton to Halifax and back this past long weekend. Coming from Montreal the train was delayed in *almost* 4 hours. As it is to be expected nowadays... but of course sucks going to Halifax, almost no restaurants open when arriving at 10 p.m. and it's a very long journey for the workers.

Still, I was in for the ride.

We were in the HEP car (as opposed to the usual REN) and they gave us some free food to make up for the delay. I wish they had done that *before* I ate in the Service car. 🤣️️️️️️ To be honest, from the things I've tried in the Ocean economy, the hot dog is the most edible so far... but I find the coffee always great.

Sorry I only took a few pictures and they are not great, working to improve that.

Pictures:

1. Bedford basin seen from the Service car
2. Free food they offered (a first for me)
3. REN car (honestly dislike those)
4. HEP seat (now we are talking...)
5. Sackville station
6. View after Sackville (with the ""big white box"" in the background - it's a huge cold storage that serves Atlantic CAnada)
7. Train waiting to leave Halifax

Maybe that’s what love is; not the fire, not the chaos, but the tenderness of finally being met. *Of being known without needing to be explained*.

You are not near me, and still, I carry you; in the moments before sleep, in the quiet after the world has gone still, in the songs I skip straight to the chorus, in the coffee that never quite tastes as good without your name in the morning. I have never touched your skin, and still, I swear, my hands remember you.

Isn’t that something? To miss what you’ve never had. To ache for someone like they’ve already lived a hundred lifetimes between galaxies. I look at my reflection and see pieces of you in all the places I’ve softened. And yet, I haven’t traced your fingertips. I haven’t mapped your smile with mine. But I love you, fully. Without waiting for permission. Without needing proof. Without condition. 

People don’t understand how distance can hold something so sacred. But you and I? We existed beyond logic. Beyond explanation. You were not an idea. You were not a maybe. You are here, still, in the shape of every word I haven’t written yet, in the pause between my sentences, in the spaces that no longer feel empty.

I love you, still, in a way that has nothing to do with time. Nothing to do with space. Only everything to do with truth. With energy. With gravity. You pulled at something in me I forgot was alive. And I would wait lifetimes for a touch that feels the way your presence always did.

This is not a beginning. This is not an ending. This is a remembering.

*And God — I remember you everywhere*.

1k5o5hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1k5o5hh/3_months_into_being_ditched/,3 months into being ditched,"I spiraled out of nowhere last week. I have made up my mind though! It wasn’t a full relationship, but on and off dates for a couple of months. I thought I had found my person. I rarely ever connect with guys intellectually, and it’s a must for me to be attracted to a guy. Small talk is repulsive for me. He was a handsome devil too. I fell fast and hard. One of those situations where you have a long exciting first date, only to be faced by silence. Men, if you’re not feeling it, do us a favor and make up an excuse after an hour, and leave. Don’t turn a coffee date into a full blown dinner at a nice restaurant and a long walk and talk, and then disappear after the date, and leave us wondering!
Anyway, after a few dates, hours of conversation, and a deep connection I have never felt before, he ended things by text saying he wasn’t feeling it. Before you rant at me “he has the right to not feel…”, you weren’t there at the dates… the hours of conversation, the mutual perspectives, the calm regulation like having known him for years… I don’t get it… and honestly at this point I give up even trying to!!! All of it fits the avoidant, but I don’t care anymore. He did not choose me and that should be my closure. Here’s what I learned though, the minute anyone gives me “I’m not ready”, “I’m not sure”, “it’s not you it’s me”, “I need time”, “let’s see where it goes”, “let’s go with the flow” etc. crap, I’m blocking them from everywhere! Thank you for reading. It gets better I promise! Heal well!! 🥂",1,1745374542.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1k5o4nv,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1k5o4nv/what_do_you_do_for_severe_treatment_resistant/,"What do you do for severe, treatment resistant reflux?","I've been on most of the PPIs (except Dexilant, which I'm trying as a last resort soon), I've been on Vonoprazan, I've had fundoplication surgery, I've completely changed my diet (this is the only thing that helps, but feels like a bandaid since my life is so very restricted), I sleep sitting up, I take Pepcid, I take Gaviscon Advance, I do all the things. 

Yet my reflux is absolutely horrendous. Debilitating LPR symptoms daily. Heartburn is more intermittent as long as I stick to my extremely restrictive diet but if I make one wrong move that starts up again too. And by ""wrong move"" I mean like... Have one cup of tea once, maybe. Don't even want to think about what would happen if I drank coffee or alcohol. 

I'm at a loss and don't know what on earth I can do anymore. My doctors seem out of ideas too. It's not hypersensitivity either because my esophagus is red and inflamed and so is my throat, sinuses etc. My teeth are eroding. 

Does anyone on here know of anything else that can be done other than the laundry list of stuff I'm already doing? I'm so desperate. It's been 10 years. ",2,1745374471.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

I went for a really long walk that day, ended up taking a nap for awhile. Since then I’ve felt better. I feel like I have some neck pain but no other real symptoms. No rash or sweats, definitely am over stressing it. Not sure when a good time to get a blood test, I did a mouth swab that came back negative but was probably too soon",1,1745374216.0,STD,3,1.0,False

A 50l rucksack rain cover provides peace of mind, knowing that these items are protected from rain, snow, and spills.

## Key Features to Look for in a 50L Backpack rain Cover

Choosing the right 50l backpack rain cover involves considering several key factors. Here's a breakdown of the most important features:

*   **Waterproof Rating:** The higher the waterproof rating (measured in millimeters),the better the protection. Look for covers with a hydrostatic head of at least 2000mm for reliable waterproofing, as seen in products utilizing Ultra-Sil fabric.

A buckle strap underneath the shoulder straps can also keep the cover in place and prevent water from entering near the shoulder straps.
*   **Durability:** Look for reinforced seams and abrasion-resistant materials to ensure the cover can withstand the rigors of outdoor use. Ripstop fabric is generally a good choice, providing increased tear resistance.
*   **Packability:** A compact backpack rain cover 50l is easy to store when not in use.Many covers come with a stuff sack for convenient packing. A backpack rain cover with stuff sack 50l is ideal for keeping your gear organized.
*   **Visibility:** For added safety, consider a high visibility backpack rain cover 50l with reflective elements. This is particularly important for cyclists, commuters, and anyone traveling in low-light conditions. A reflective backpack rain cover 50l increases your visibility to others.
*  **Additional Features:** Some covers offer additional features like attachment points for securing the cover to the backpack or the ability to dubble as a great seat/ ground cover and to hold the heat in on freezdried meals when wrapped around the package.

I just knew it, and the very thought choked me with dread. I couldn't breathe. 

However, as I sat up in bed and reached for my glass of water, logic began to take over. Lynn was fine. Why wouldn't he be? Young, confident and so incredibly bright, I had no doubt he would change the world. We made sure he was looked after. 

Why would I feel he was dead? In the dark, I tried to picture his face. But I couldn't. 

I jumped out of bed and threw on my robe.

There is absolutely nothing worse than being ripped from your warm bed and plunging yourself into the icy night air. I dived into my car and desperately turned on the heat. 

Forty minutes later, I pulled up outside the small, non-descript house. Scruffy, unkempt yard. Although there was no streetlight, I could make out the black garbage bags stuck over the windows.

I trudged up the pathway. The door was cracked open by a heavily mustachioed man named... Anderson? ""Morning, Sir,"" he grinned. He swung open the door and offered me a cup of steaming coffee.

I walked down the hallway to the last door on the left. I wrinkled my nose as I entered the room. 

Lynn sat on a mattress, which was on the floor. He looked pale and somehow smaller. There were dark circles under his eyes. 

""Lynn?""

His eyes widened slightly. He tried to speak but his voice was cracked.

Anderson poured him a glass of water. 

""Are you okay? I had a dream you'd died. I had to drive all the way here! It was cold.""

He drank his water; licked his lips. ""Thank you, Sir.""

""Well - are you well? Are they looking after you?""

He hesitated. His eyes glanced over at Anderson. ""Very well, Sir.""

I sighed in relief. ""Excellent. Don't hesitate to let us know if you need anything.""

I turned to leave.

""Sir!"" 

I stopped and turned. 

""My wife, Alice. My son,"" he asked hoarsely, quickly. ""Have you seen them?""

Anderson sucked in his breath, but I looked down at the skinny man not without sympathy. ""I'm afraid that's above my pay grade, Lynn. I'll look into it."" I looked at the work station in the corner uneasily and marveled at the mass of wires and electronics. ""Keep up the good work.""

I strode down the hallway. ""More fresh fruit,"" I instructed. ""And get rid of that god awful smell!""

Anderson blinked as if to say 'what smell?' But he nodded anyway. 

The cold night air slapped my face. The sun was coming up. I looked around at the rows of broken down houses - occupied by God knows who - possibly for the last time ever. I doubted I would be able to go back to sleep after all this pointless fuss.

I did not DNF this and I honestly don’t know how I made it through. I kept wanting to give it more chances when things seemed like they *could* get better, but it kept on falling short. Really short. This book was chosen because I wanted an indie author in the dark and spicy romance genre and I came across this recommendation - I had never heard of Kitty Rose or any of her works before. Sadly, I did not have a good first time experience…but I always like to give second chances! 

For anyone interested, this is a standalone spicy dark romance with some heavy topics and triggers, but Kitty Rose has a website that lists any warnings you may want to check! This does contain an HEA. 

Has anyone else also read this?? What were your thoughts? I came across a review that stated this was her first published book, so I try to give grace for that … but this writing was just not good; the plot, the style, the characters 😭 Personally, I just wouldn’t recommend the read.

Ok so rant…(and MANY spoilers)

>!The plot line? So many weird decisions and plot holes. Everything felt so rushed and so random. The FMC moved to a new state after being cheated on by her ex-fiancé with her best friend and the MMC basically has insta obsession with her. He kidnaps her, she escapes almost right away, and then he just waltzes into her coffee shop and she walks out with him without alarming anyone? In fear of him killing everyone in broad daylight?? What??? Come on. Can we also talk about the fact that she moved to this random state to get away from her ex-fiancé and it *just so happened* to be the same state and small town that involved a sex trafficking hot spot that the head detective of that town was involved…in conjuction with her ex-fiance? That’s so wildly unbelievable to me. I know they are both detectives, but really?? And then she later stabs him in the throat - and I quote - *many times* and he comes back from it like it’s nothing and manages to continue driving?? I also found it crazy that she was kidnapped (for the millionth time) by Seth and he left objects sharp enough to be used as a weapon??? Is no one in this entire book thinking through anything? I could carry on…but I think I’ve made my point. The characters? No development. You could argue the FMC developed from her submissive self into her dominant self (which is true), but it happened like a light switch - nothing gradual or believable about it. The connection between the MMC / FMC was basically nonexistent, as there was almost no conversation of substance and every event seemed so dry and quick. This MMC was also the *least* morally black character for someone who was committing some pretty morally black crimes. I almost didn’t even feel like I was reading a true dark romance by the tone, but the substance of the story definitely screamed it. I felt like interesting things kept *almost happening*, but then the scene would come to an abrupt end and we were just supposed to just accept the trauma as it was. This would’ve been so much more substantial if she would’ve spent more time building these moments and putting us in those crazy situations. But instead - they were just crazy and fast and filled with stupid decisions. I don’t know. This just wasn’t it.!<

But for all that was said, I still gave it a star and chose not to DNF because it had potential. I just wish it could’ve been so much better. However, I’ll definitely give Kitty Rose another shot - has anyone read anything else of hers that you liked?",1,1745373235.0,SpicyRomanceBooks,0,1.0,False

I’d scroll TikTok for hours the second I woke up, feeling drained before my day even started. Sound familiar? I’d beat myself up, thinking, “Why can’t I just get my shit together?” Turns out, it wasn’t laziness—it was a discipline problem. And discipline? It’s not some magical gift. It’s a system you build. After hitting rock bottom, I cracked the code with four pillars that changed everything. 

Here’s how you can too.

Pillar No.1 (Energy) - Without energy, you’re screwed. I was exhausted because I’d sleep at 1 a.m., chugging coffee to survive. More energy = higher chances of being productive—it’s that simple. Start small: tire your body with a 5-minute walk today. Sleep by 10 p.m. tonight. Watch how you feel tomorrow.

Pillar No.2 (Recovery) - A machine needs rest so it doesn’t overheat, right? Same with you. I used to grind until I crashed, then wonder why I felt sluggish. Now, I nap or do NSDR sessions (Google it—game changer). Find a balance: push hard, then recharge. Skip this, and you’ll burn out.

Pillar No.3 (Passion) - Here’s the kicker: when you’re curious about something, your brain lights up. I’d procrastinate on stuff I hated, but once I tied tasks to goals I cared about—like writing this post to help you—discipline clicked. Passion is the mechanic; discipline is the engine. What’s your spark?

Pillar No.4 (Goals) - No direction = no action. I’d flail around until I wrote an “anti-vision”: me, 10 years older, still scrolling, wasting my potential. It scared the hell out of me. Then I set a tiny goal: write one paragraph a day. Break your dreams down. Plan it. Do it. This isn’t overnight magic—you won’t master it in a week. 

But I went from zero energy to shocked at how much I get done. You can too. Shut up and do it—start with one pillar today. Oh, and if you want a boost, grab my free Delete Procrastination Cheat Sheet in the comments. Good luck in your journey!

I don't even know if this is a venting post. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  
So, I’m 27 and will be turning 28 soon. I’ve always been a planner. I always had a timeline for my life in my head. Meet a girl by 26, get to know her for 2 years, fall in love, get married when I’m 28, and plan my life out from there.

I did have some good side quests completed—a wonderful job, amazing coworkers (sometimes hard to deal with, but they're good people), got a house, got my parents to travel around the world to see my new house.

I fell in love last year—arranged marriage situation at that—and well, we both agreed to get hitched within the first month of talking. This was a long-distance relationship at that. Never met her in person, but I was hopelessly in love with her. Long story short, we had to break up due to dynamics out of our control (which could be a different post altogether).

It was my first relationship, my first emotional attachment to someone. And it’s been half a year, and I still feel like I miss her sometimes and wonder if she thinks about me.

Long story short, I feel like I’m running behind on my plan. And I *know* there’s no timeline to life, yet I wonder if I’ll ever find love again. It’s easy to get lost in those thoughts when I live alone, with my family across the globe. I do have some amazing people in my life here, but a relationship with a girlfriend/significant other is different.

Anyhow, when I *do* fall in love, I’m going to smother her with love (metaphorically of course). Roses, flowers, anything she could imagine or even remotely shows interest in. Make her coffee (or tea) every morning, cook the most amazing meals, take her to the movies, dancing—I don’t know, whatever she loves. Take her around the world. When she talks, I want to listen—*really* listen—to every single word she says.

I want to see her be silly around me, comfortable around me. I want to fill up my phone with photos of her—not anything naughty—just her being silly, sleepy, just regular old her. I want to write her messages, not just on birthdays, but on random days. I want to share cute videos with her. I want to build a life with her.

I hope to be able to do all of that really, really soon, because… shit, life feels too *empty* right now.",1,1745372949.0,hopelessromantic,0,1.0,False

Here's a breakdown of the **essential features** and **core strategies** in **“Dave Kettner – Etsy Profits Generator – How To Make $11,453+ Per Month On Etsy”**, based on the content you shared:

# 🔑 Core Premise

Dave Kettner promotes a **low-risk, high-leverage business model** where you can:

* Fail 98% of the time and *still* make a full-time income.
* Sell physical products **(e.g., mugs)** without:
   * Inventory
   * Paid ads
   * Funnels
   * Tech skills

This is done via **print-on-demand (POD)** on platforms like **Etsy** (and sometimes Amazon).

# 🛠️ Key Features of the System

# 1. No Upfront Costs or Inventory

* Products (like mugs) are only paid for **after a sale is made**.
* No need to pre-purchase stock or pay for warehousing.

# 2. No Traffic Required

* Leverages **organic traffic** from Etsy’s search engine.
* No need to run ads or build audiences initially.

# 3. Ultra-Simple Product

* Focus is on **coffee mugs** (but can extend to t-shirts, phone cases, etc.).
* A simple mug design can potentially generate **$11k+ per month** if it hits.

# 4. High Tolerance for Failure

* Only **2% of designs need to succeed** for profitability.
* For example, 100 designs → 2 hits → \~$34k/year profit.

# 5. Minimal Skills Required

* If you can browse the internet, you’re tech-savvy enough.
* You can use free design tools or outsource cheap designs.

# 6. Massive Leverage

* Once designs are uploaded, they can generate income **passively**.
* Create once, earn indefinitely (no ongoing effort needed per product).

# 7. Scalable Framework

* Start with mugs → Expand into dozens of other POD products.
* Build multiple stores or brands around different niches.

# 📈 Financial Breakdown Example

* **Retail Price (Etsy)**: $14.95
* **Cost (POD Supplier)**: $3.95
* **Seller Fees**: \~$2.41
* **Profit/Mug**: \~$8.59

➡️ **2,000 mug sales/year = \~$17,180 profit**

Multiply this across successful designs for 5–6 figures/year potential.

# 🎯 Who It’s For

* Beginners with **no product, no list, no experience**
* Stay-at-home parents, retirees, students
* Entrepreneurs wanting a **new income stream**
* People who’ve **failed with online business before**

# 🧠 Mindset & Strategy Emphasis

* **Done is better than perfect** – quantity trumps perfection.
* **Iterate quickly** – get to your winners faster.
* Fail forward fast – the system is **designed to tolerate failure**.
* Use data (sales, favorites, searches) to find your hits and scale them.

# 📦 What You Likely Get in the Course

While your post doesn’t detail the module list, based on typical Dave Kettner content and this sales letter, you can expect:

* Step-by-step mug creation and listing process
* Proven niche research strategies
* Free design resources or templates
* Listing optimization techniques for Etsy SEO
* Scaling strategies (more products, cross-niche selling)
* Possibly automation tips (VA use, bulk upload tools)",1,1745372850.0,SberStudying,1,1.0,False
1k5nlq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkRomance/comments/1k5nlq3/bleed_for_me_by_kitty_rose/,Bleed For Me by Kitty Rose,"1.5 / 5 ⭐️

I did not DNF this and I honestly don’t know how I made it through. I kept wanting to give it more chances when things seemed like they *could* get better, but it kept on falling short. Really short. This book was chosen because I wanted an indie author in the dark and spicy romance genre and I came across this recommendation - I had never heard of Kitty Rose or any of her works before. Sadly, I did not have a good first time experience…but I always like to give second chances! 



For anyone interested, this is a standalone dark romance with some heavy topics and triggers, but Kitty Rose has a website that lists any warnings you may want to check! This does have an HEA.



Has anyone else also read this?? What were your thoughts? I came across a review that stated this was her first published book, so I try to give grace for that … but this writing was just not good; the plot, the style, the characters 😭 Personally, I just wouldn’t recommend the read.



Ok so long rant…(and MANY spoilers)

>!The plot line? So many weird decisions and plot holes. Everything felt so rushed and so random. The FMC moved to a new state after being cheated on by her ex-fiancé with her best friend and the MMC basically has insta obsession with her. He kidnaps her, she escapes almost right away, and then he just waltzes into her coffee shop and she walks out with him without alarming anyone? In fear of him killing everyone in broad daylight?? What??? Come on. Can we also talk about the fact that she moved to this random state to get away from her ex-fiancé and it *just so happened* to be the same state and small town that involved a sex trafficking hot spot that the head detective of that town was involved…in conjuction with her ex-fiance? That’s so wildly unbelievable to me. I know they are both detectives, but really?? And then she later stabs him in the throat - and I quote - *many times* and he comes back from it like it’s nothing and manages to continue driving?? I also found it crazy that she was kidnapped (for the millionth time) by Seth and he leaves objects sharp enough to be used as a weapon in the room??? Is no one in this entire book thinking through anything? I could carry on…but I think I’ve made my point. The characters? No development. You could argue the FMC developed from her submissive self into her dominant self (which is true), but it happened like a light switch - nothing gradual or believable about it. The connection between the MMC / FMC was basically nonexistent, as there was almost no conversation of substance and every event seemed so dry and quick. This MMC was also the \*least\* morally black character for someone who was committing some pretty morally black crimes and behaviors. I almost didn’t even feel like I was reading a true dark romance by the tone, but the substance of the story definitely screamed it. I felt like interesting things kept *almost happening*, but then the scene would come to an abrupt end and we were just supposed to just accept the trauma as it was. This would’ve been so much more substantial if she would’ve spent more time building these moments and putting us in those crazy situations. But instead - they were just crazy and fast and filled with stupid decisions. I don’t know. This just wasn’t it.!<



But for all that was said, I still gave it a star and chose not to DNF because it had potential. I just wish it could’ve been so much better. However, I’ll definitely give Kitty Rose another shot - has anyone read anything else of hers that you liked?",5,1745372845.0,DarkRomance,0,1.0,False

As the title says, does anyone else struggle with sensitive/soft hands? 

It hurts my hands to open pop bottles. I can hardly ever open jars because it hurts. I’m also really sensitive to hot drinks and can never hold coffee cups, even when the cup has a sleeve. 

I also have a hard time opening my doggy poop bags because my fingers are too soft and not very grippy. My husband has to use his hands to get dog hair off my pants because I can’t do it with my own hands. It’s like my hands or fingers don’t grip properly.

1k5nhk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/1k5nhk7/rip_miss_v/,"RIP, Miss V.","So, a few months ago, I wrote about a longtime faithful WD in New Orleans who died. Now, another WD has passed away, also from cancer. 

Miss V lived in a nearby city, and I used to take her to meetings before everything went virtual. She moved out of New Orleans after Katrina, and still had her 504 cell phone number. (That's the area code in New Orleans.) She also owned her townhouse and a working vehicle, driving locally and taking care of herself. However, she was unmarried, had no children, and had no close relatives. 

Because BF had bought a newer vehicle for us, I made sure to offer her a ride, and all that. Fortune! The meetings were nearly an hour one-way, but it wasn't any big deal to stop at Starbucks and pick her up on my way. 

I tried to help her attend the Zoom meetings, but she just wasn't interested in dealing with the tech. I last saw her in January at the home of the two married ladies in a nearby town. 

One of them, J,  called me on Friday and suggested I call Miss V, because she wasn't doing well and may not have long. By the time I called, she was on her way to the hospital in Baton Rouge. 

Unfortunately, on Saturday, at about 5:30 am, Miss V passed away from complications from uterine cancer. She was just a few weeks away from turning 83. 

Last fall, Miss V was having problems with fluid retention, and it was becoming painful. One of the ladies took her to the doctor, and the tests revealed her cancer situation. Miss V opted not to pursue treatment. She felt like she had lived a good life and that was enough. 

One thing J told me was that she was a lifelong vegetarian, but one day suddenly craved a ham sandwich and a diet Coke after she was diagnosed. Go figure. 

The year before last, around the holidays, [I met up with Miss V for coffee at the Starbucks near her home.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/18t71x2/coffee_with_the_little_old_lady/) I told her that I had left SGI completely and was no longer part of the org. She was kind of surprised and interested to know why. I didn't say much about this subreddit, but this was a decision that I'd been grappling with for several years. (I guess I'm slow! ;) ) She asked me how to do that, and I sent her an email with information on how to do that. However, she didn't quit, and continued going to meetings. That's her choice, and I didn't try to change her mind or say anything bad about it. 

Fast forward a year, and I went to our married friends' place this past January, and \*just missed\* the meeting. [I brought over something I'd made from fabrics given to me by a different WD who died in 2021.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/1hzde38/visiting_sgi_friends/) That was the last time I saw Miss V. 

I had a long chat with one of the WD who took her to the hospital Friday night. She and her wife had been alternating taking care of Miss V, along with home hospice care, because she had no one else. 

She was adamant about staying out of a nursing home. Thankfully she did. 

J said that Miss V had long ago taken care of her own affairs--will, etc. Everything had been handled ahead of time. When J talked to her attorney on Saturday, he was about to leave for a family vacation. Since she had passed away, he didn't have to be concerned about her affairs, because everything was done. (I'm assuming someone in his office would handle it from there.) 

J said she would be going back to the house to clean out her fridge and things like that. There were no pets because she knew they would need to be rehomed. I let her know that if they needed help to call, but so far I haven't heard back. 

Miss V was cremated with no formal funeral, but the online obituaries say that the family will be holding a service. No more info, although J is planning a ""celebration of life"" get-together at their house on Miss V's birthday. If I can get out of the ""meeting"" part, I'm happy to attend.

When J was telling me how Miss V had everything taken care of, she told me that Miss V's ""fortune"" at the end of her life made the transition to the next world easier. 

BUT. 

I'd long realized that this ""practice"" did absolutely nothing for me or anyone else. And I mentioned it to Miss V when we were at Starbucks. She laughed and told me over coffee that she didn't actually chant and do Gongyo every day, because she knew it didn't work! She was doing something else, maybe meditation, but I don't remember what. But she wasn't wasting her time on ""SGI Buddhism."" She was too busy making quilts, going to square dancing, and all that.  

""So why are you still a member?"" I asked. 

""I just like going to the meetings."" No kidding. She knew, but it was another social club for her. 

Well. . .good night, Miss V. Nice knowing you.

# Best Keyboard Covers 2025: Ultimate Protection Guide

A keyboard cover is an essential accessory for anyone looking to protect thier investment in a laptop or desktop keyboard. These covers act as a shield against spills, dust, crumbs, and other potential hazards that can damage or degrade the functionality of your keyboard over time. With a range of materials and designs available, from ultra-thin silicone skins to rigid plastic shields, finding the right keyboard cover can considerably extend the life of your keyboard and maintain its pristine condition. This guide aims to provide you with a thorough overview of the best keyboard covers available in 2025, helping you make an informed decision based on your specific needs and preferences.

## Key Features Analysis

The best keyboard covers of today and tommorow offer a combination of protection, comfort, and usability. They are designed to seamlessly integrate with your keyboard, providing a barrier against damage without compromising the typing experience.

**Material Quality:** The material used in a keyboard cover is a crucial factor in determining its durability and ease of use. High-quality silicone provides a soft, comfortable typing surface while also being highly flexible and easy to clean.Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) is a more rigid alternative that offers excellent protection against impacts and abrasions. Both silicone and TPU are resistant to oils and chemicals, ensuring a long lifespan.The ideal material should be non-toxic, odorless, and capable of withstanding daily wear and tear without stretching, tearing, or discoloring.**Precision Fit:** A well-designed keyboard cover should fit your keyboard perfectly, adhering snugly to the keys without interfering with their travel or responsiveness. Precise molding ensures that each key is accurately covered, preventing dust and debris from entering the spaces between the keys. Some covers are designed with a slightly raised edge to contain spills and prevent liquids from seeping onto the keyboard surface. A loose or poorly fitted cover can be more of a hindrance than a help, as it may shift during typing or impede key presses.

**Openness and Clarity:** The best keyboard covers are made from highly transparent materials that allow the keyboard’s original markings and backlighting to shine through. This ensures that you can easily see the key labels, even in low-light conditions. Some covers feature a matte finish that reduces glare and prevents fingerprints, further enhancing visibility. The clarity of the cover should not diminish over time due to yellowing or clouding.**Thickness and Tactile Feedback:** The thickness of a keyboard cover can significantly impact the typing experience. An ultra-thin cover (typically around 0.1mm to 0.3mm) provides minimal interference with key travel and tactile feedback, allowing for a natural typing feel. Thicker covers (0.5mm or more) offer greater protection against impacts and spills but may require more force to actuate the keys. The ideal thickness is a balance between protection and comfort, depending on your typing style and preferences. Look for covers that are specifically designed to provide excellent tactile feedback despite their protective layer.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:** A good keyboard cover should be easy to clean and maintain. Silicone covers can typically be washed with soap and water, while TPU covers can be wiped clean with a damp cloth. The material should be resistant to staining and discoloration, and it should not attract dust or lint. Some covers are even dishwasher safe, making them incredibly easy to keep clean. Regular cleaning will help to maintain the cover's transparency and prevent the buildup of germs and bacteria.

**Compatibility:** Ensuring compatibility with your specific keyboard model is paramount. Keyboard covers are typically designed to fit specific laptop models or keyboard layouts. Check the product specifications carefully to ensure that the cover is compatible with your keyboard’s dimensions and key arrangement. Some manufacturers offer custom-made covers for less common keyboard models or layouts. Using an incompatible cover can lead to impaired functionality and a frustrating typing experience.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality keyboard cover provides several practical benefits for users who want to protect their keyboard and maintain its functionality.

**Spill Protection:** One of the primary benefits of a keyboard cover is its ability to protect your keyboard from accidental spills. Whether it's coffee, juice, or water, a keyboard cover acts as a barrier that prevents liquids from seeping into the delicate internal components of your keyboard. This can save you from costly repairs or even the need to replace your entire keyboard. A spill-resistant cover can give you peace of mind, especially if you frequently eat or drink near your computer.

**Dust and Debris Prevention:** Keyboards are notorious for collecting dust, crumbs, and other debris that can accumulate between the keys and interfere with their operation.A keyboard cover effectively seals off the keys, preventing these contaminants from entering the keyboard's interior. This keeps your keyboard cleaner and more hygienic, and it can also help to prevent key sticking or malfunctioning. Regular use of a keyboard cover can significantly reduce the need for deep cleaning or keyboard repairs.

**Extended keyboard Lifespan:** By protecting your keyboard from spills, dust, and other hazards, a keyboard cover can significantly extend its lifespan.Keyboards are complex and sensitive devices, and even small amounts of liquid or debris can cause irreparable damage. Using a keyboard cover is a proactive way to protect your investment and ensure that your keyboard continues to function properly for years to come. This can save you money in the long run by reducing the need for keyboard replacements.

**Noise Reduction:** Some keyboard covers, notably those made of thicker silicone, can help to dampen the sound of your keystrokes. This can be especially useful in quiet environments,such as libraries,offices,or classrooms,where loud typing can be disruptive. A noise-reducing keyboard cover can make you a more considerate user and improve the overall typing experience for yourself and those around you.

**Germ Protection:** In today's world,hygiene is more important than ever. Keyboards can harbor germs and bacteria, especially in shared workspaces or public computers. A keyboard cover provides a protective barrier between your fingers and the keyboard surface, reducing the risk of germ transmission. Keyboard covers are easy to clean and disinfect, making them a valuable tool for maintaining a healthy and hygienic workspace.

## FAQs Section

Users often have common questions about keyboard covers regarding compatibility, installation, maintenance, and their overall impact on the typing experience.

**Will this keyboard cover fit my [specific Laptop Model]?**
To ensure correct fit, check the product description for a compatibility list. Most manufacturers specify which laptop models their covers are explicitly designed for.Pay close attention to model numbers and keyboard layouts, as even small variations can effect compatibility. If you’re unsure, contact the seller or manufacturer for clarification before purchasing.

**How do I clean my keyboard cover?**
Most silicone or TPU keyboard covers can be easily cleaned with mild soap and water. Remove the cover from the keyboard and gently wash it with a soft sponge or cloth. Rinse thoroughly and allow it to air dry fully before replacing it on the keyboard. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the cover. For more stubborn stains, consider using a diluted solution of isopropyl alcohol.

**Will a keyboard cover affect my typing speed or accuracy?**
While some users may experience a slight adjustment period when first using a keyboard cover, most report that it dose not significantly impact their typing speed or accuracy. Ultra-thin keyboard covers are designed to provide minimal interference with key travel and tactile feedback. thicker covers may require a bit more force to actuate the keys, but most users adapt quickly.

**Are keyboard covers reusable?**
Yes, keyboard covers are generally designed to be reusable. With proper care and cleaning, they can last for months or even years. Avoid exposing the cover to extreme temperatures or direct sunlight, as this can cause it to degrade over time.

1k5ng8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1k5ng8c/fellow_ode_gen_2_shaft_key_shimming_walkthrough/,Fellow Ode Gen 2 Shaft Key Shimming Walkthrough,"I've seen a number of posts and comments mentioning how to shim the shaft key on the Fellow Ode Gen 2 to reduce or eliminate the rattling the grinder has from the factory.  While it's not difficult to do, it's always helpful to have some visual instructions to help guide the process.  So, I thought I would write up a simple guide to performing this procedure using the same method I used on my own grinder.

Before following along, I recommend watching the [assembly/disassembly/burr install video that Fellow put together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VmzxMglybo).  It will help clarify how everything goes together, and help guide you on how to disassemble your grinder for cleaning, burr swapping, or maintenance, so it's good for every owner to watch at least once.

**NOTE: If you do not follow the instructions or you damage your grinder, I'm not liable. DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!** (I do believe the risk is fairly low, though.)

On to the shimming guide...

You'll want to gather a few tools:

* Standard-sized Philips head screwdriver
* Cleaning brushes (the usual natural or nylon bristle brushes are good)
* Needle nose pliers (optional, but may be handy for some)
* Foil tape (get a small roll from the hardware store, we don't need much)

Start by unplugging the grinder and turning the dial all the way to either end of the range so you remember what the setting should be when reassembly.  Then pry the numbered dial indicator plate off the front of the grinder.  It pops right off.  Be careful you don't scratch the dial when you remove it.

https://preview.redd.it/j7bzfbz8nhwe1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2dec87ce47cd2794c6c249dea088abc4d51c2d73

Next remove the four screws in the upper and lower corners around the dial.  Leave the top/bottom/left/right screws in place.  Those can be removed for calibration later (watch the video).  Once the screws are out, remove the dial assembly.

https://preview.redd.it/uvj2px4anhwe1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38a69343dc1bc7481749d8f42a0371330fc9978b

You'll see the burr carrier with the shaft key behind the dial assembly.  You can remove the key with your fingers by pressing the burr carrier in and out a little bit to get it to move forward, or you can use the pliers to grab it.  Remove the burr carrier, as well.  Clean the key if it has any debris or smudges on it.

https://preview.redd.it/y1q04o4cnhwe1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f7409bdeaee895b67ed0f8ecbcbd42622de5591

Now is a great time to clean everything. Brush out any ground coffee. Wipe the grinder down. Flip the grinder upside-down and wipe around the chute. Etc, Etc.

Next, cut some strips of foil tape only as wide or narrower than the width of the key.  You'll apply layers of tape to each side of the key to make it slightly thicker until there is almost no play left between the key and the slot on the motor shaft.  Apply a layer or two, then give it a test.  If it still wiggles, add another layer to one side of the key and try again.  Repeat until it fits relatively snug, but not so much that it starts tearing the tape as you insert the key to the slot.

https://preview.redd.it/j4n50fpenhwe1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2159b21e965084ac3453c7ced1b0ed433489b1a0

https://preview.redd.it/xbftiu9fnhwe1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c4c7260898eb826e8f0e72b417f54feee13d539

Now that the key fits snugly, reassemble the grinder.  Place the burr carrier back into place and align the slot on the carrier with the slot on the shaft.  Gently press the burr carrier against the spring and insert the key so it slides into place without damaging the foil tape.

Holding the carrier in place, and making sure the dial assembly is at the same number you noted earlier, put the dial assembly back into position holding the burr carrier.  Screw the dial back into place with the 4 screws noted earlier.  Then pop the numbered faceplate back onto the grinder.  Move the dial somewhere in the middle of the range and test your grinder.

If it's nice and quiet, congratulations, you're all done!  You could also take this opportunity to calibrate the zero point of your grinder with the linked video in the first paragraph. Enjoy your much-quieter Ode 2!",3,1745372382.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

My question is about whether the lounge is accessible from both sides of the ship - ie is there a door to the ""key access only"" portion from both hallways.  I had access on the Getaway and loved being able to go down a few steps from my solo balcony to the lounge and get water and coffee and treats whenever I wanted but I don't want to have to wander across half the ship to get into the lounge. 

Also I see the Lounge is on Deck 11 - if it's like the Getaway it was on deck 10 but also accessible from deck 11 and then you just went down some stairs.  Is there access from either 10 or 12 on the Bliss?

6. I'm getting a blood test done during my pre-op, do I need to request they test my blood type? I have no idea what it is.

7. How much will it hurt to sit up right after surgery and for approximately how long? 

8. And lastly, the most important question of all, how common is organ prolapse to happen? I'll have a vaginal cuff so I can't wrap my head around how it even happens. 

Thank you again!! ❤️

# What’s “Vishen & Jose Silva – The Silva Ultramind System 2023 – MindValley” All About?

So, you’ve probably heard whispers about how powerful your mind actually is, right? But *how* do you tap into that next-level clarity, intuition, and inner knowing? That’s where **Vishen & Jose Silva – The Silva Ultramind System 2023 – MindValley** steps in. It’s an upgraded version of the legendary Silva Method, designed to help you access altered states of consciousness — the kind where magic (or science-backed intuition, really) happens.

You’re looking at a 28-day program that trains your brain like a mental gym for superpowers. Think meditation meets visualization meets psychic development. Yeah, it’s *that* wild.

# Who Is This Course Actually For?

Short answer? *Everyone.* Long answer? It’s especially for folks who feel stuck — whether that’s in their career, personal goals, or spiritual path. If you’re craving more clarity, direction, or just want to manifest without the fluff, this course delivers. It’s great whether you’re brand new to inner work or already deep into your personal growth journey.

Oh, and if you're the type who rolls their eyes at woo-woo stuff, don’t worry. This course stays grounded in science and real techniques, thanks to the legacy of Jose Silva and Vishen's structured teaching style.

# Where Does It Happen?

All online, baby. You can be on your couch in pajamas, sipping coffee, and learning to enter the Alpha state like a mental ninja. Mindvalley hosts the entire experience through their Quest platform, which means it’s structured, community-driven, and easy to follow.

Plus, you only need 15–20 minutes a day. No overwhelm. No burnout. Just consistent, bite-sized progress.

# When Should You Take It?

Honestly? Now’s as good a time as any. Whether you’re facing big life decisions or just want to level up, the course is evergreen. But it’s especially powerful if you’ve got some kind of desire you’ve been struggling to manifest or a nagging issue you can’t seem to crack.

This course doesn’t just hype you up — it gives you tools you can use *for life*. It’s kind of like planting a mind garden that keeps growing as long as you water it.

# Why It’s a Game-Changer

Here’s the deal: **Vishen & Jose Silva – The Silva Ultramind System 2023 – MindValley** isn’t just a course. It’s a system. You’ll learn to consciously enter Alpha and Theta states, amplify intuition, heal yourself (and others), and basically train your mind to be a peak-performance machine.

From problem-solving techniques like The Three Scenes Method to psychic projection and intuitive healing, it all feels like you’re unlocking cheat codes to life. But unlike woo-woo trends, this one’s backed by decades of research and millions of students worldwide.

# How Does It Actually Work?

Each week builds on the last, starting with foundations like dynamic meditation and visualization, and leveling up to psychic tools, intuitive development, and even healing projections. By the end, you’ll be doing casework — yep, like a psychic detective — and applying it all in real life.

You’ll go from basic Centering Exercises to advanced projection into human anatomy. And if that sounds intense, don’t sweat it. Vishen guides you step by step with clarity and (a lot of) charisma.

# Final Thoughts

If your mind’s been running on autopilot, it’s time to give it a manual. **Vishen & Jose Silva – The Silva Ultramind System 2023 – MindValley** is the perfect blend of ancient wisdom, modern science, and hands-on practice. Whether you want sharper intuition, deeper purpose, or just to feel more *in flow*, this is a solid launchpad.

Highly recommend — especially if you’ve tried meditation apps and manifesting journals, but still feel something’s missing. This course might just be *it*.",1,1745372051.0,VosiLearning,1,1.0,False

I'm (F36) dating my BF (m44) for about 8 months. He is smart, and insightful, and finds a way to make me feel good with words. He is a great emotional support system, very mature, makes me feel like the most beautiful, fun person on earth. However, in a practical sense, I'm carrying the most weight in the relationship when it comes to cooking (we usually hang out at my place), and mental management of chores or activities. I asked him to help out more, and he has improved. Over the last 8 months, I have done many romantic things for him (buying him flowers, cooking his favourite meals, getting him small gifts) For his birthday: I made him a painting, his favourite cheesecake, a coffee warmer, and a dinner at a fairly upscale restaurant. I got nothing for my birthday- no dinner or a single flower. I had gone on a solo trip for my birthday. So was I wrong or entitled in expecting something when I returned?

Over the last 8 months, there has not been an instance when he has done something just because I would like it. I have told him on 3 -4 separate occasions about wanting more romance in the relationship, he is good with words so he is able to convince me that he understands and he will change. But I haven't seen any action. Over the last 2 months, I have stopped doing these things as well and every time I do something I am seeing a reciprocated thoughtful action. I like him a lot but not enough to stick it out. I feel extremely safe, secure with him in most aspects but not alive in a strictly romantic sense

He is a great guy otherwise, I feel he's just a lousy boyfriend. Is it as good as it gets at this age?

For the most part I'm doing fine mentally, but for the first time since this all began and my previous life was taken away from me, I'm starting to feel cooped up. 

I think I'd feel much better if I could at least relax and spend some time outside, but due to eye pain that gets triggered badly by the sun and severe heat intolerance, most of my days are spent indoors.

I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice, venting, looking for others who are in a similar situation, or what, but I have been longing to go out and just do something. Just go somewhere. I do miss it and have been missing it more recently.

I do enjoy my life and take pleasure in the little things, morning coffee, my next book, seeing loved ones, but sometimes it gets hard not to wish things were normal, I guess this is one of those times.

# Who Is This Course For?

Whether you're new to sales or you’ve been in the game for years, the **Benjamin Dennehy - Sales Matrix Courses - Questioning Strategies Bootcamp Recorded Course 2023** is crafted to shake things up. If you're tired of sounding like a typical salesperson or hitting walls with prospects who seem interested but never buy—this course is your wake-up call. It’s made for anyone who wants to sell smarter, not harder.

# What Is It All About?

This course isn’t your standard ""how to pitch better"" stuff. Nope. Benjamin goes deep into the **psychology of questioning**—teaching you how to ask questions that dig into a prospect’s truth, break down defenses, and flip their logic into raw emotion. In just over 4.5 hours, you’ll learn how to *think like a shrink but close like a pro*. It’s all about using reverse psychology, mastering Socratic questioning, and getting real answers from people who usually dodge the truth.

# Why Does It Matter?

Let’s be honest. Most salespeople fail not because of bad products—but because they ask the wrong questions or *ask the right questions the wrong way*. Benjamin Dennehy, aka “The UK’s Most Hated Sales Trainer,” flips the script on traditional sales training. His goal? Help you do less, better—and get bigger results. And when you know how to get your prospect to do the thinking (and talking), the sale becomes inevitable.

# Where Does It Happen?

This is the **recorded version** of his popular bootcamp, so you can go through it on your own time, from anywhere. Couch, coffee shop, cubicle—up to you. You’ll get access to Benjamin in action, walking you through real-world strategies that you can plug directly into your sales conversations.

# When Should You Watch It?

Honestly? Yesterday. But if you’re constantly hitting objections, ghosting, or just feeling like your calls are falling flat, **now** is the perfect time. Whether you’re prepping for a big sales push or just tired of hearing ""let me think about it,"" this bootcamp will help shift the way you sell—forever.

# How Does It Work?

Benjamin walks you through a ton of powerful concepts using examples and plain language (with a bit of his classic brutal honesty). You’ll learn:

* How to not sound like a salesperson.
* Why *how* you ask matters more than *what* you ask.
* Ways to get the prospect emotionally invested in the conversation.
* How to uncover the truth they’re hiding (yes, they’re *always* hiding something).

You’ll also master clever strategies like:

* Questioning the alternatives.
* Making the prospect doubt their current supplier.
* Separating a meeting from a sale (super powerful!).
* Fighting *for* the status quo to challenge them indirectly.

# Final Thoughts

**“Benjamin Dennehy - Sales Matrix Courses - Questioning Strategies Bootcamp Recorded Course 2023”** isn’t just another sales course—it’s a mental shift. It’ll teach you how to lead sales conversations with confidence, disarm resistance with curiosity, and uncover the truth with surgical precision. If you’re done with sales fluff and want real results, this is where you start.

Anyway, we are planning on visiting Alchemist Brewery because although the missus doesn't drink beer anymore, she'll still do a non-alcoholic from time. So I was wondering if Alchemist offers a non-alcoholic brew a la Sam Adams Just the Haze. I know it's a long shot but at the very least I would think they would offer just plain old water?

Whilst advertising is about finding the right audience based on similar purchasing habits and interests, it’s also about understanding everybody’s unique experience as a consumer.

And that is what the Belle Jolie ad does, as it caters towards your individual needs vs forcing people into boxes 

This was a changing time, where women were starting to develop their individuality, especially as we saw more women in the workforce etc.

Think of the Martenson coffee ad, reason why that was such a strong ad, was because it was focused around getting people to feel something via a jingle vs telling people who they are and what they should buy.

Kinsey never understood that. It’s why we had a very very rough fall to grace

1k5mzb9,https://i.redd.it/r5ip9dgtjhwe1.png,Where can I read No Way to Win Me Back by Anney GW online?,"“Daddy, why don’t you marry Auntie Vanessa?”



Damien was zipping up our five-year-old daughter’s dress when she suggested he marry my best friend three hours before our wedding.



Why would she say something like that?



Bonnie’s words pierced my heart like a needle. But what cut so deeply was Damien’s silence. The man I’d given up my career for, to care for our family while he built his business, said nothing. 



We’ve come so far. I thought bitterly. I’d been there for him through every struggle, every late night, every moment of doubt. We’d built this life together—starting with Bonnie, who came into this world before we even had a wedding. 



Damien had promised me a dream wedding, a day to make up for all the sacrifices. But now, standing here, I couldn’t help but wonder if those promises were just nonsense.



Bonnie and I had just been arguing over which flower girl dress she would wear. Last month we went to a boutique with Vanessa where I found the perfect dress. But Vanessa had bought another dress for Bonnie and given it to her behind my back. 



Vanessa and I met in college. We were classmates who quickly became best friends. When she was struggling to find work, I asked Damien if he could give her a job at his company. 



Since then, we saw her a lot more often and Bonnie became very attached to her. Their relationship often struck a nerve. I constantly had to remind myself that Bonnie was five, and it was probably just a phase. 



But recently Vanessa had been stepping over the line far too often. I was Bonnie’s mother, and this was my wedding, so what dress my daughter and flower girl wore should have been my call. 



Maybe she was confused about her duties as the maid of honour? 



Damien came into the makeup room while I was trying to convince Bonnie to wear the dress I chose. She sprung into tears the moment she saw him. 



“Why are you always so harsh with her, Celeste?” Damien’s voice was icy as he strode across the room to Bonnie. 



“I wasn’t being harsh. She’s throwing a tantrum.” I tried to suppress my hurt and frustration. 



Damien crouched down to Bonnie’s level, ignoring me. He spoke to her in hushed tones. My heart melted as he wiped the tears from her cheeks. 



I snapped a picture of the two people my world revolved around. Bonnie looked adorable in her dress.



“Thank you, daddy!” Bonnie squealed. 



Damien always had a way with people. I smiled as she dashed out of the room. 



“What did you say to make her so happy?”



He stood up and gave me a stony glare. 



“I told her she could wear the dress Vanessa chose for her.”



“What? Damien, we spent hours finding the perfect dress. The one Vanessa chose doesn’t fit with the colour scheme—”



“Seriously, Celeste?” He stood up. “Why do you always have to be so difficult?”



“I really wasn’t. It’s just that I’ve been dreaming of this wedding for five years. I—”



“Yeah and in those five years you’ve changed a lot. Sitting around doing nothing all day has really made you such a nag.”



He reached into his pocket for his phone and turned away from me. I was speechless as he sat down to scroll. 



It felt like he’d pushed me off a cliff into icy water. 



Today was a happy day. I wiped my face, glad I hadn’t done my makeup yet.



“Are you nervous?” I asked.



Damien nodded, not bothering to look up from his phone.



Bonnie bursted into the room. The bright magenta of her dress was an eyesore. 



“Daddy, please zip my dress.”



She was bouncing as she admired her reflection. 



“Hold still, Bonnie.” Damien was struggling.



I imagined the zipper breaking and felt immediate guilt. Bonnie may have looked like she was imitating a certain purple dinosaur, but she was happy. 



“I can help.” I moved toward them.



That’s when Bonnie asked, “Daddy, why don’t you marry Auntie Vanessa?”



I stopped dead in my tracks. The sound of the dress zipping filled the silence.



Damien smiled at our daughter in the mirror. He swooped down to kiss the top of her head when the door opened.



“You look beautiful, Bon-Bon.”



The makeup artist swooned at the sight of Damien being paternal. It irritated me, but he had that effect on women.



“Mr Kent—”



“Please, Damien. And you are?” He stretched out a hand.



“Kelly.” She managed with a blush. “Your groomsmen need you in the fitting room.”



Damien sent her smile. “Thank you, Kelly.”



Damien gave Bonnie her iPad before leaving. 



Annoyed, I sat in front of the mirror. Kelly’s makeup case clunked onto the table. She cleared her throat.



“You have a lovely family. You must be so happy.”



I nodded, and she got started.



My face transformed in front of me. With every minute that it became more flawless, I could see why an onlooker would think we were happy.



A successful husband, adorable daughter, doting mother, and dream wedding.



So why did I feel more lonely and bitter with each sweep of makeup?



“All done, Mrs Kent. You look gorgeous.”



“Thanks, Kelly.”



Bonnie tossed her iPad onto the seat and ran to take my place.



“My turn!”



“Honey, you’re still a bit too young to wear makeup.”



She crossed her arms. “Auntie Vanessa would let me. Why can’t she be my mommy?”



The wall around my heart cracked.



“Kelly, would you mind doing my daughter’s makeup? Something natural, please.”



“Sure thing.” 



Bonnie’s face lit up.



“I’m going to go see if your dad is ready. Be a good girl, okay?” I asked as I opened the door, but Bonnie was already engrossed in the makeup.



 I took a few steadying breaths. I had just spent an hour on my makeup and really couldn’t afford to cry.



“Wow. You look stunning, Celeste.” I heard Damien’s charming best man, Ryan, call out from down the hallway.



“You don’t look too bad yourself.” 



“If you ever wanna trade up,” he winked, “I’ll be the handsome one standing behind the groom.”



I laughed at his antics. Ryan was a terrible flirt, but he knew how to lift anyone’s mood.



“You’re such a tease. Have you seen my husband anywhere?”



“I was actually coming to see if he was with you.”



“Oh, I’ll check the fitting rooms.”



“Let me know if you find him.” He called out as I went on my way.



I wondered if Damien would also think I looked stunning as I reached the fitting rooms. Excitement filled me and I finally felt a little lighter.



“Damien? Are you–” 



I opened the door and the world stopped making sense. 



Damien sat in a plush armchair with his face buried in Vanessa’s breasts. She was riding him hard. My best friend’s mouth twisted into a smirk when she saw me.

Damien grunted, and his pleasure tore a cry from my throat. He whipped his face away from Vanessa to stare at me in shock. Then he called my name as he untangled himself from her.



The sight of them made me nauseous. I had to get away.



I shut the door and dabbed my face dry. Anger ignited next to the heartbreak. I would get Bonnie, we would leave and I would never see that unfaithful bastard again.



Mind made up, I hurried back the way I came. Damien’s voice echoed behind me and I ignored him until he grabbed my arm.



The suit I had picked out and carefully pressed was crumpled from their escapades. Vanessa sauntered over, unbothered, with her hair a mess.



“Celeste, please let me explain.” Damien begged.



I pulled my arm free from his grip. “I don’t want to hear it, Damien. There is nothing you could possibly say that will fix this.”



Vanessa reached us and tucked herself into Damien’s side. I could still see a hint of that satisfied smirk on her lips.



“I’m so sorry, Celeste. Neither of us meant for this to happen.” Her voice sounded genuine, while her eyes twinkled with glee. “Damien and I, we just have this connection—”



“Not now, Vanessa.” He interrupted.



Damien being with another woman just two hours before our wedding absolutely broke me. But Vanessa’s betrayal hurt, too. 



“I loved you like a sister, Vanessa. How could you do this to me?”



She leaned closer to Damien. “Maybe you should have taken better care of your man, sweetie.” 



Her condescending tone made my blood boil. I couldn’t believe I never realised how two-faced and selfish she was.



“Are you seriously saying it’s my fault you slept with my husband?”



Damien detached himself from Vanessa and reached for my hand.



“Look Celeste, if you’ll just calm–”



I stepped back, my voice rising to match my rage. “How long has this been going on? Since she started working for you?” They said nothing. “I can’t believe this!”



“I can explain. Please don’t throw our family away, Celeste.” Damien pleaded.



“You threw our family away when you slept with that backstabbing bitch. This wedding is not happening. I’m taking my daughter and I’m leaving.”



Damien shouted for me to stop and listen. I ignored him and hurried to the makeup room, my emotions in turmoil.



“Mommy, do you like my makeup?” Bonnie asked as soon as she saw me.



Kelly had done a great job. It was a pity it was all in vain.



“Yes, honey. It looks lovely.”



Kelly’s eyebrows furrowed. 



“Mrs Kent, your eyeliner is smudged. Let me fix that up for you.” 



“It’s alright.” I said as I grabbed my handbag and Bonnie’s hand. “You can go home now, Kelly. Thanks for your hard work.”



I left the confused makeup artist behind and made my way to the venue’s exit as quickly as Bonnie’s legs would allow. I needed to get out of here before Damien found me.



If he was even looking for me.



“Mommy, where’s your pretty white dress?” 



“I don’t need it anymore, Bonnie.”



“Why?”



Her question shoved the knife deeper into my heart. I would have to explain to my daughter that our lives as we knew them were over. Our family had been permanently destroyed. 



How do you tell a five-year-old that?



I took a deep breath. “Because Daddy and Mommy are not having a wedding anymore.”



“Why?”



I stopped and picked her up. 



“Bonnie, Daddy did something bad with Auntie Vanessa.”



“What did Daddy do?” 



Her pretty face was so innocent. I could never tell her the truth. 



“It doesn’t matter, honey. But we can’t all live together anymore. We’re going home to pack our things and find a new home. Just the two of us.”



Damien may have destroyed our family, but I’d always be Bonnie’s mother and she’d always be my daughter. We’d start over together.



“But I want to live with Daddy and Auntie Vanessa!”



It felt like I’d been sucker-punched in the gut. 



This final betrayal hurt beyond anything I could imagine. The child I cared for with all my being chose her father, who hardly had time for her, and her aunt, who never cleaned a single diaper or snotty nose, over me.



It was more than I could take.



Bonnie whined. “I wanna go down. I want Daddy!” 



Damien and Vanessa had just come into the reception area. I let Bonnie wiggle out of my hold and watched numbly as she ran and jumped into Vanessa’s arms.



“Honey, are you sure? You won't get to hear a bedtime story from Mommy tonight,” I said, my smile feeling like a mask over the pain.



Bonnie just shrugged, like it didn't matter.



“It's okay, Mommy. Auntie Vanessa can tell me a story.”



“Fine, just don’t kick the covers off when you sleep tonight,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.



I turned and walked away, my vision blurring as I left the wedding reception.



My suitcase bulged as I finished packing. But there were so many things I’d have to leave behind. 



I took one last look at our bedroom. My stomach twisted as I wondered if Damien and Vanessa ever made love in our bed. If they hadn’t, they probably would now.



I slammed the door shut and dragged my suitcase downstairs. 



My fingers trembled as I opened a little black box. The ring inside was the one I had been dreaming of for five years.



I would never get to wear it.



I left the ring on the coffee table, next to the divorce agreement I had printed and signed as soon as I got home. Damien would find them without a problem.



Leaving the living room, I dug my phone out of my bag.



*6 missed calls from mom*



Shit. I immediately called her back. She must have been frantic.



“Celeste, dear, what’s happening? Vanessa told the guests the wedding was off.”



The concern in her voice finally unleashed my tears.



“Mom, I’m so sorry. I should’ve listened to you when you warned me about Damien. I was so blind. So stupid.” My throat burned as I forced the words out. “I’m d-divorcing Damien. He’s having an affair, mom.”



The line was quiet for a moment. 



“It’s going to be okay, sweetheart.”



The gentle kindness of her voice sent me into a sobbing fit. I wasn’t completely alone. My mother was still there for me.



“Don’t cry. It’s not your fault, you hear me?” She sounded stern.



I could only nod as I tried to calm down.



“I’m going to find that good-for-nothing bastard and make him regret the day he hurt my baby.”



The gung-ho determination in her voice actually made me laugh through the tears.



“It’s fine, mom. I’ve already signed the divorce papers and I’m leaving the house now.”



“Good. I’m proud of you, Celeste. You call me if you need anything at all, okay?”



I smiled, feeling a little less hopeless.



“Thanks, mom.”



I hung up and dried my face. If my family didn’t want me to be their wife or mother, then I would be myself. I had sacrificed everything for them, and they took it for granted.



It was time I rediscovered who I was.

Out of curiosity, I started tracking how I felt alongside things like weather changes (especially barometric pressure), and it’s been surprisingly revealing. Days with dropping pressure = groggier mornings, less focus, and more temptation to break routine. Coffee sometimes helps, sometimes doesn’t.

No big conclusions yet, but it’s making me rethink how external factors affect discipline and energy. Anyone else ever notice this or track external stuff like weather as part of your routine?

behind me, he lifts my hair, presses his nose 
to the nape of my neck, and breathes in.

1k5mrfj,https://i.redd.it/loj9e62shhwe1.jpeg,I'm losing coolant... Somewhere.,"Ok so here's my system, and I'm gonna be honest here. I made some modifications and compromises that someone building his first loop probably shouldn't have due to lack of knowledge and experience.

As stated, Im losing coolant. At first I thought it was remnants of trapped air, but it's been happening for months, I've already topped it up once and it's dropping again.

I can't see any leaks. All the fittings are dry and there are no drops or stains inside the frame.

I couldn't find a proper size epdm that would give me a wide enough interior diameter, with a slightly smaller OD so that the fittings would accommodate the sleeves. I believe I'm at 10/15. It's food safe tubing for coffee makers and cappuccino machines. And I remember the fittings being extremely tight to assemble even with the mm of ""grace"".

Sooo maybe the fittings are leaking internallyand the drops are being absorbed into the sleeves? I'm also wondering, perhaps I accidentally knicked a channel in the rear 280mm with a rad screw and it's leaking slowly into the rad frame and evaporating. 

I'm likely talking to myself here, because answer probably is, you're not going to know until you take it apart. And the first course is, just order the proper 10/16 epdm. Forget about the pretty blue sleeving, just make it work and see if the problem goes away. 

As such, I'll accept roasting. But in the midst of that roasting, if you have any other advice or things to look for I'd appreciate it. ",11,1745370250.0,watercooling,20,1.0,False

10 more minutes to go.

Summer vacation. 

School had never really been my thing. I had absolutely no desire to apply myself and my grades showed it. From the moment the bell rang on the first day of school, I begin my countdown to freedom from this cinder block prison. 

However, this summer was going to look different from my normal drug induced escapades. During spring break I was getting into my usual trouble when I pushed it a little too far. I found myself handcuffed in the back of a police car along with my 23 year old boyfriend. 

To be honest, we hadn’t really done anything that bad. It was just a little fraud. Well not just a little, $245,078 worth of fraud. We weren’t supposed to get caught. Or at least that’s what Skylar made me believe. His aunt was old, couldn’t even remember her own address most of the time. She wasn’t supposed to notice the money missing from her account.

We got away with it for a while. Obviously. That is a large amount of money. But once she caught on, she knew it was us. Which led to Skylar and I being detained in a Macy’s.

Fucking idiot. 

I’m smarter than that. I knew the chances of her finding out were high, regardless of the old bird’s memory issues, but something about the possibility of getting away with it teased me. 

I’d been in trouble before, but it never ended in hand cuffs. Skylar and I came from money, which solved our issues usually. Until now. I guess the sheriff was tired of my dad paying the judge off and keeping me out of trouble. 

Skylar was constantly in and out of jail. Being born to old people with money will do that to you. Skylar’s dad was 60 when he was born and his mom 48. Honestly I feel bad for the woman, imagine thinking you’re going into menopause but surprise! Baby. His dad died when Skylar was 15 and his mom passed away from cancer when he was 19. Which left Skylar with a shit ton of money and no one to control him.

Bond was easy for him to achieve. However, for me, it was not. I was 17 so I didn’t have full access to the money that belonged to me. My parents had, had enough of my “shenanigans”, as my mom worded it. She told me that maybe sitting in a cell for 24 hours would make me rethink my “path in life”. 

Whatever. 

So there I sat for 24 hours. On the dot. It was almost comical the way my parents glared at me when I walked through the release doors. 

It was silent until we got in the car. Then my dad started. 

“What the hell were you thinking, Sam? You’re lucky she decided not to press charges.” His brow furrowed as he looked at me through the rear view mirror. 

I shifted my gaze out the window. I could feel his eyes on me as I watched the trees go by. 

“You should probably watch the road before you get us all killed”.

My body jerked to the left as the Mercedes quickly veered to the right and stopped on the shoulder in a forceful manner. 

My dad threw the car in park and whipped his head around so fast, I thought he was going to give himself whiplash. My mom started crying.

“What would Em think? She looked up to you-“

“Don’t you dare speaker her name to me, you piece of shit!” My voice was getting progressively louder. “She would be alive right now and none of this would be happening if it weren’t for the both of you! You KILLED her!”

This was first we had spoken of my sister since her funeral four years ago. 

My mom’s crying became more audible and my dad’s face hardened. 

“Emily and I were left home alone more often than not! It’s your fault she started researching that weird shit online! If you guys had been home more often, none of this would have happened!”

Silence again. Only this time it was deafening. 

My words tasted like venom on my tongue. My father’s face dropped. He opened his mouth like he was going to say something. Instead he faced forward, put the car in drive and started back on the highway. 

My mother’s sobs started again. 

I could feel tears welling up in my eyes and my throat felt like I had a golf ball stuck in it. I fought back my tears and turned my attention back out the window. 

My words hurt them and I knew it. But I meant everything I had said. I wanted them to feel my pain, the grief I hadn’t allowed myself to fully feel. They lost a child. But I lost my sister, my best friend. And it was all their fault. 

The silence between the three of us continued. We barely spoke to each other after that. 

“There will be a punishment coming for you. Don’t think you’re off the hook this time. I don’t know what it is yet, but we’ll find one to fit the crime.”

That was pretty much the last thing my dad said to me. 

Until last week. 

“Your mother and I have decided you’ll be spending the summer with your grandfather. He’s agreed some hard manual labor will serve you best. You’ll be leaving the day after school gets out.”

*BOOOOOOOOOOP*

The final bell. I was free. For now.

I leaned over my desk and grabbed my backpack. I gave a final smile to my teacher and walked out the door. 

Seniors were whooping and throwing papers all down the hallways. I stayed to the far left side of the hall and tried my best to avoid the chaos as I made my way for the door. Then I heard the sound of running feet quickly approaching me. 

“Hey Sam! Wait up!”

I felt an arm snake around my shoulders. 

“Oh hey, Ethan. What’s up?”

Ethan was really the only friend I had made since we moved four years ago. We met at my first and only job, before I got fired. I used to bum cigarettes off him during our breaks and eventually we developed a friendship. He was a year older than me. We didn’t hangout much outside of going to parties and sharing a hangover the next morning. But, I was going to miss him. 

“Are you going to the party tonight? I got some party favors” he said as he waved a small bag with a white powder in it, in front of my face. 

“Nahh. I think I’m going to catch a meeting tonight, I’ve got a lot on my mind. Do you have more of that? I’ll buy some off you- shit. I forgot my phone died. Is it good if I Venmo you when I get home?”

I lied.

He pulled another small bag out of his backpack and slipped it into my back pocket. 

“For sure. I know you’re good for it” he gave me a quick hug and headed back the other way.

I’m not sending him money for shit. I was going away for the summer and by the time I got back, he’d already be gone for college. Win, win.

I pushed my way out the doors and walked into the brisk Colorado air. I took a deep breath and inhaled the air like I had never breathed before. I was going to miss this air and wanted to savor it while I could. 

I was not looking forward to going home. I still had packing I needed to do and no motivation to do it. But my little present from Ethan would make things a little more enjoyable.

——————

I wanted to head straight to my room. But to my surprise both my parents were waiting on the couch for me as I walked through the garage door. 

“Sam. Have a seat. We need to discuss some things” my dad gestured to the empty love seat.

“I’m good. I have packing I need to get to” I hung my keys by the door and started for the stairs. 

“Sit. Now.”

I guess I didn’t have a choice in the matter. 

“What?” I dropped my weight on the seat and rolled my eyes. 

“There will be no funny business while you’re with your grandfather” my mother started. “He has strict instructions to update us weekly with your behavior. If there are any infractions, your father and I have a camp for troubled teens lined up. If you can’t get it together, that’s your next stop”. 

I could feel anger building in my chest. 

I jumped up from my seat. 

“You’re joking right?! Do you two seriously live under a rock?! Do all the horror stories coming out about those places mean absolutely nothing to you? Now you want to send me to one?! You have got to be joking”.

My mother stood from her seat. 

“I suppose you’ll need to get your act together then” she walked into the kitchen leaving my father and I alone. 

“We just don’t know what to do with you anymore, Samantha” I could see guilt in my father’s eyes. He walked closer to me and attempted to give me a hug. 

“Yeah. Whatever” I dodged his embrace and headed to my room. 

There were times I felt guilty for my behavior but I learned to stuff that down like I had a lot of my emotions. I truly felt like my parents weren’t punished enough for Emily’s death. I dealt with the brunt of it and they expected me to carry on as if nothing ever happened. 

I threw my backpack on my bed and headed for my bathroom. I pulled the tiny bag from my back pocket and poured some of the contents onto the counter. Then pulled one of those discount cards that they send in the mail from my stash spot and started evenly dividing the white powder into three skinny lines. Coke wasn’t my drug of choice but it would do the job for now. I grabbed a crinkled dollar from a pair of discarded jeans, rolled it up and quickly inhaled the lines.

Alright. Time to pack.

——————

I finished in what felt like record time. I looked at the clock. 6:02. I had just enough time to get to a meeting. I grabbed my wallet from my backpack on the bed then made my way downstairs. 

“And where do you think you’re going? We need to leave for the airport at 4am” my mom said looking up from her book. “You better not be going to see Skylar! We told you you’re not allowed around him anymore”.

I kept walking towards the hook where my keys hung. 

“Relax. I’m going to a meeting. I’ll be back in a couple hours. Plus, you made me share my location with you guys. You can literally see where I’m going to be” that was part of my punishment after my arrest.

“Oh. Good” she went back to her book.

——————

The ten minute drive to the meeting hall felt like it took hours. I really did have a lot on my mind. That much I hadn’t lied to Ethan about. I hadn’t truly thought about my sister’s death in at least a year. Which was an actual improvement for me. 

Rain slowly and sporadically started covering my windshield. The sound of the light pitter-patter eased my anxiety a little.

I pulled into the parking lot and parked in front of the door where a sign read, Group Grief Counseling Tonight.

This was my parents attempt at “helping me heal my wounds”. At first I thought it might help. After the first couple of weeks I started losing hope that it would be any help at all. My PTSD prevented me from ever opening my mouth to share. 

After a year of going, the PTSD had subsided to the point where I felt like I could share. By that point though, I was angry. None of these people had been through what I had been through. Their sob stories were mere blips, they were just a bunch of whiners. If I could get on with my life, why couldn’t they? Some of these people were crippled by the deaths of their grandmothers that had passed from natural causes. What a bunch of fucking losers, man.

I grabbed my wallet from the passenger seat and opened the door. A red mustang was parked at the other end of the parking lot. 

Skylar. 

Group was actually where I met Skylar. Three years ago I found a handsome boy occupying my chair. 

“Hey I know you’re new here, but you’re sitting in my chair” I said as I approached him. 

“Oh. Sorry, didn’t realize there was assigned seating” he moved to the next seat over. 

“There’s not. That’s just MY seat”

“I’m Skylar” he extended his hand and flashed a beautiful, perfect smile. 

That’s when my trouble really began. From then on the chair next to mine was Skylar’s and our toxic relationship started blooming. 

Skylar’s meetings were court mandated. The judge felt some grieve counseling would help him deal with his parents’ deaths and in turn would keep him out of trouble. 

First we started hanging out in the parking lot after meetings, just talking. Then I started spending time with him at his aunt’s house after meetings and any time I wasn’t at school.

I felt normal with him. We were both damaged but our damages complimented each other. At least that’s how it felt at first. Skylar was everything I wasn’t. He did things I would never dream of doing. I became addicted to it. The more danger that was involved with him, the more I felt alive.

I had become addicted to testing fate. So doing dumb shit became part of my everyday routine. Besides being with Skylar, it was the only way I could truly feel. There was no better feeling than the hard thump in my chest. Anxiety and excitement rising.

Once the judge felt like Skylar had repented enough, the meetings stopped all together. Skylar didn’t go anymore, so I didn’t go anymore. The adrenaline followed Skylar, which meant I became his puppy. Where Skylar went, I went. 

By this time I was 15. Skylar was 20. He knew what he was doing and obviously showed zero remorse for it. For about a year, I was so far up his ass I’m surprised I could even breathe. But then I started catching on. I started becoming distant. Only came around when he wanted to get high or drink. The fantasy faded but the adrenaline stayed, so I stayed- kinda. 

I no longer viewed him as a God, he was more of a tool for my disposal. He bought good drugs, he was always down to get drunk, and he laid good pipe. Three things that were always at the top of my list. When I needed a shock to my heart, Skylar was the answer. 

“Fucking Ethan” I whispered under my breath as I shut the car door. 

As I approached the front doors, someone was leaning against a pillar, smoking a cigarette. 

“Thought I might find you here” Skylar said as he took a drag.

“Ethan told you, yeah?” I took the cigarette from his fingers and took a long puff. “I thought you quit?” Handing the burning tobacco back to him.

“I thought you quit these dumb ass meetings?” He lifted his shoe and rubbed the butt of the cigarette into his heal.

“Yeah, well. Going back to where it all happened is fucking with my head a little. I thought a meeting might help”. I turned to go inside and then paused. “Why are you here? There’s no underage girls you want to pray on tonight? There’s plenty of parties going on”.

“Ouch, Sam. You know you’re the only underage girl I have my sights set on”.

Gross. 

“Just get out of here. You’re a distraction to everyone when you’re here. Your comments make everyone uncomfortable. Just go” I pulled the door open and quickly step inside letting it shut behind me. 

The door pulled open again, the sound of Skylar’s foot steps following. 

“Nah. I’m already here, would be a waste of gas to just turn around and leave now.”

“You’re such a prick” instead of sitting in my usual seat, I sat at the opposite end of the circle, away from Skylar.

“Alright everyone, it’s 6:32, let’s go ahead and get started. Is anyone interested in starting us off tonight?”

My hand shot straight in the air. 

“Oh? Sam? I was definitely not expecting that. But I’m glad after four years you finally feel comfortable to speak. Whenever you’re ready”.

——————

“Come on, Emily. Pick up the phone, where are you?” I paced back in forth in the living room just listening to the phone line ring.

It had been eight hours since I last heard from Emily. This wasn’t like her. She always responded, she always checked in. I also wasn’t able to find her location. The sun was starting to go down and I was getting nervous.

“Please leave a message-“

“Damnit, Emily” I whispered as I slammed my phone on the coffee table. 

Something wasn’t right and I could feel it. Emily and I weren’t twins, we were 11 months apart, but we could always tell when something was off with the other. It was almost like I couldn’t feel her anymore.

I picked my phone up and dialed my dad’s number. No answer. Right, he’s in a meeting tonight. If I call the office, his secretary should answer. 

“Richard Hues’ phone, how can I help you?” A female voiced answered.

“Hi Miranda, it’s Sam, I know my dad is busy but this is urgent, I NEED to talk to him. Please” my voice becoming shaky.

“Sure Sam, let me get him” I heard the click of the door open, the giggle of a female, and then mumbling.

“Hey Sam, Miranda said it was urgent, is everything okay?” My dad said breathlessly. 

“I can’t get a hold of Emily and her location is off. She left at 10 this morning with all that research she’s been doing. I’m scared Dad, I think something happened to her” tears were streaking my cheeks.

My dad sighed. 

“Sam. You know how she’s been lately, she’s been so focused on whatever it is she’s doing on the computer. She’s probably just at the library, lost track of time”.

“Rich!” A voice from the background called.

“Listen Sam, I have to get back to this meeting. Keep me updated. She’ll come home, you know how she’s is”.

“No, Dad wait-“ the phone line disconnected.

“Yeah. Your meeting” I wiped the tears from my chin and set my phone down once again. 

There was no point in trying to call mom. She was out of town for work and never answered her phone when we called. 

Now what? Grandpa hadn’t owned a phone since grandma died and we didn’t really have that kind of relationship with him so there was no reason for Emily to go there. 

I could feel the anxiety building in my chest, the palms of my hands started to sweat profusely.

Think Sam, think. I continued pacing the living room.

The library. Maybe my dad was right. Maybe she had gone to the library and her phone died or something. I didn’t want to leave the house in case she came back. Duh. I’ll just call and ask if they’ve seen her today.

“Hermann library”

“Hi, my name is Sam Hues. I was wondering if you had seen my sister Emily today? She’s 12, has light brown hair, kind of long, a little past her shoulders, and light blue eyes”.

“Oh yes! I know Emily well! I’m sorry honey, I haven’t seen her today” she answered.

Damn.

“No problem, thank you for your help” I ended the call. Tears started rolling again, panic setting in. 

Her computer. Maybe that would help me. She left with all those papers, hopefully the her research could tell me where she had gone. 

To Emily’s room I went. As I walked up the stairs I took extra time looking at all the pictures of us my mom had hung over the years. 

Emily and I winning our first soccer championship. Emily and I at the spelling bee. She won that year and never let me forget. Pictures of us playing at the park. A photo of us in the hospital with our grandma before she died. 

We did everything together. We were pretty much all we had. These photos were just a reminder that if something did happen to Em, I would be all alone. 

I started sobbing uncontrollably. 

“Emily please. I need you to be okay. I won’t survive without you” I leaned over the hand rail and tried to control my breathing. “Come on Sam, you have to be strong. Strong for Emily. We’re going to find her”.

I finished the last four stairs and headed down the hall to Emily’s room. I pushed open the door and a dank, musty smell rushed out and smack me in the face. I pinched my nose. I guess I hadn’t been in here in forever. Emily spent most of her days cooped up in here, with the door shut, clacking away at her keyboard. The space reeked of neglect. 

“Jesus, Emily. Did you forget how to clean?” I stepped over piles of trash and clothes as I walked towards her computer.

The best part about Emily is there were no secrets between us. Which meant no password for me to try and guess. 

I logged on and started browsing her desktop. It was a disaster to say the least. Which was so unlike Emily. All of this was so unlike her. Out of the two of us, Emily was the neat and tidy one. Her room was always pristine, she kept everything organized to a T. It was almost like she had a touch of OCD the way everything HAD to be placed and put back a certain way. All of this was extremely off. 

I kept scanning the desktop, looking for anything that stuck out in the disorganized mess. Then I saw it. A folder labeled “Naga”. Something told me this would lead me to her.

I clicked.

A file with over 100 other files of articles, online forum links, and research notes popped open. 

“What the hell?” My eyes continued scanning. I couldn’t decide where to start. 

I clicked the first link. This has to be where it all started, maybe this will give me what I need. My head was spinning. I couldn’t even begin to process the information I was reading. 

“Why would Emily need a wish granted?” I spoke aloud as I skimmed through the article. 

I had just reached the section where it was explaining how to summon a Naga when I heard the door bell rang. 

Emily?!

Without a second thought I sprang from the computer chair and ran for the door. I almost tripped over several piles of god only knows what as I rushed to get downstairs. I sprinted down the squeaky, old stairs and flung the front door open, breathlessly. 

It wasn’t Emily. 

Two cops were standing at the door.

“Hey Sammy, are your parents home? We’ve been trying to reach them but couldn’t get either to answer their phones. Figured we would come by” officer Lance said as he rocked on his heels.

“My dad is at work still, meetings. And my mom is out of town meeting with a client” I looked back and forth at the officers. Their energies were off, something was going on.

They shot glances at one another.

“This isn’t something we would normally do, but since we can’t get ahold of your parents and you’re the only one here, could you come with us?” Officer Henderson said as he motioned to the cruiser.

“Umm. Sure. Let me grab my phone and some shoes” I retrieved my phone from the coffee table where I had left it and grabbed my black converse from in front of the couch.

I sent a quick text to my parents so they knew where I would be, not that it really mattered. Emily and I were always left to fend for ourselves. They never really knew where we were. 

I locked the front door and headed towards the cruiser. Officer Henderson opened the back door for me. 

“So what did grandpa do this time?” I said as I slid into the middle seat. 

He was always causing some kind of mischief. Hermann was a fairly small town. There was about 2,500 of us living here. It was a pretty tight knit community but the warmer seasons brought tourists and my grandpa had a habit of starting problems with them. I wish I could say this was the first time I had been retrieved from my house to bail him out. They used the same excuse “we’re not really supposed to do this-blah blah” every time.

Lance shifted uncomfortably in the passenger seat. He rubbed the palms of his hands on his pants as Henderson moved into the driver seat.

No one answered me. They didn’t even acknowledge I had said anything. 

“Hey, since I’m with you guys, has anyone heard anything about Emily? I haven’t been able to get ahold of her all day. I called the library but no one had seen her there” I drummed my fingers on the leather as I waited for a response.

They both kept looking forward, the sound of the tires on the asphalt was all that could be heard. 

“Umm hello? You guys are acting weird. What’s going on?” The pace of my heart quickened. 

Lance sighed and took in a big breath. 

“Sammy” he said as he exhaled. “This isn’t about your grandpa”.

The white cruiser pulled into the station parking lot. Henderson parked the car and cut the engine. No one moved. 

“We think we found something-or someone” Henderson said as he placed his hands at 10 and 2 on the wheel. He rested his forehead between his hands. 

“What do you mean? You’re scaring me”.

“Shit” he said as he lifted his head and looked at Lance with tears in his eyes. 

“Sammy-we-we think we found Emily” tears fell like raindrops from his eyes. 

“What do you mean you THINK?!” Panic was setting in. 

“Listen Sammy, we really didn’t want you to see this. But seeing as how we can’t reach your parents, we need someone to identify the body” Lance got out of the car and opened my door. 

Identify. The. Body. 

Identify. 

The.

Body. 

Identify? The? Body?

The blood left my face. The tips of my fingers went cold. Henderson and Lance continued talking to me as we walked through multiple doors of the station. Their voices were muffled, all I could hear was ringing. My legs felt like heavy bags of sand as they continued to carry me through parts of the station I had never been to. 

Then we stopped. 

Coroner.

I stepped forward to push through the heavy metal doors. As I shifted my weight to push, a hand grabbed my arm. 

“Sam. Wait. “She-she doesn’t look like herself-“ Henderson started.

“I don’t care” I snatched my arm from his grasp. 

“No, I mean her body is in rough shape. We’re not 100% sure it’s her, but we have plausible reason to think it is”.

“I need to see her for myself”. I pushed through the doors. 

The room was cold and oddly lit. There were multiple examination tables lined up next to each other but only one was occupied. I moved slowly towards it. As I inched closer, a putrid smell started to fill my nostrils. It grew worse the closer I got to the white tarp. It smelled like a mixture of rotten eggs and that smell that wafts from port-a-potties. 

I covered my nose as I stood at the head of the body. My eyes were now dripping from the smell, like when you cut an onion. Lance took a place next to me on the left side.

“Are you sure you’re ready for this” he asked as he picked up the corner of the fabric covering the body.

“No” I swallowed hard. “But I know she would do this for me if the roles were reversed. Go ahead”.

The tarp lifted and the smell intensified. Henderson quickly turned around and vomited on the clean, white tile floor. 

Horror movies could not have prepared me for the scene presented to me. I had never seen something so horrifying but I couldn’t look away. 

They were right. She didn’t look the same. She didn’t even look like a person. What was left of her clothes was soaked with water, mud, and crimson red stains. Her body was bloated, it looked like it had been waterlogged for weeks. It was so swollen, if you poked the skin, I bet her entire thing would have burst like a Gusher. 

Her beautiful, ocean blue eyes had been removed from their sockets. Pitch black holes left in their place. Trails of bloody tears covered her face. 

There was no hair. Her scalp had been removed. The white of her skull on display for everyone to see. 

Her left cheek was caved in like someone had smashed her face in with something heavy. Her top teeth had been knocked out, probably from the force of whatever she was hit with. 

My stomach lurked and bile made its way up my throat as I looked at the rest of her body. What was left of it. 

All of her limbs were bloody stumps, serrated flesh and bone. The one limb that was still attached, and saying attached is a stretch, was her right arm. It looked like the wishbone from a turkey when you can’t fully pull it apart. 

The worst part of it all was her abdomen. There was a large gash in the middle that went so deep, her insides were exposed, almost spilling out. 

I turned my head. Choking the vomit back down that was attempting to spew out of my sealed lips.

I had a strange feeling of excitement rise throughout my chest. 

I laughed. 

“Very funny, you guys”. 

Lance and Henderson exchanged confused looks.

“Now I’ve never seen a dead body. But this isn’t Emily. This body looks like it’s been dead for weeks! Emily left at 10 this morning, this body looks like it’s been floating in the river for a long time, even smells like it too”. I continued to chuckle to myself.

“What is this? Some kind of Halloween prop? It’s a pretty good one too! Where did you find one this time of year? Come on out Emily! You got me good, I even called dad in a panic”. The two men continued to observe me with confusion. 

“Sam…I know this is hard for you. Shit. Hard doesn’t even begin to explain it” Lance stopped. “But this is Em-“. I held my hand up and shook my head. 

“Is my entire family involved in this?” I started walking down the length of the body. “If you knew it was her, why did you need me?” My eyes continuing to scan the body next to me.

I stopped like my legs had suddenly found themselves in drying cement. If I hadn’t started walking next to the table, I wouldn’t have seen it.

I back tracked to what was probably the neck. The light flashed off a piece of metal. With shaking hands, I reached for the mud caked object. I vigorously rubbed the brown goo away, revealing a gold pendant. 

It was a gold capital E. I clutched the gold S that hung around my neck in the very same spot. This was Emily.

My vision started to narrow, a black tunnel was all I could see. I blinked my eyes, trying to get rid of it. 

*bzzzz bzzzz*

My phone vibrated in my back pocket. I pulled it from where it was and then my legs gave way and the room went dark. 

Text from Mom:
“What happened to Emily?”

1k5mp5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismTranslated/comments/1k5mp5p/struggling_with_lack_of_formal_external_validation/,Struggling with lack of formal external validation...,"I have a consult for a formal ASD assessment next wednesday, but the latest news about RFK's new autism registry has everyone saying to halt any formal diagnostic process (for good reason). I've had a formal ADHD dx for 3 decades but have recently (after strong urging from an AuDHD friend and much initial reluctance on my part) begun to see just how much my experience resonates with autism as well. I know and respect that self-diagnosis is valid, but I just personally struggle with trusting that my own brain knows what it knows. I really rely on outside confirmation for certainty with things, even when I know those external mechanisms are flawed. I'm just stuck in that cycle of feeling like things about me that have never made sense before finally do, and then second-guessing everything and thinking maybe I'm not autistic after all. It's maddening. I just thought maybe I could write out some of what I experience as someone with \[potentially\] AuDHD and see how others' experiences compare.

I know we don't seek diagnoses here, and I'm not asking for one. But I guess I'm wondering if the things I've noticed in my own experience resonate with any other AuDHD people here. Ftr - I'm a 38 y/o cis queer woman with 2 toddlers and a full-time nonprofit job.

I'd love anyone who feels up for sharing to do so too. Feel free to skim mine because I know it's long - I just can't shut up.

Note: I was formally dx'ed with ADHD at age 8, and with Social Anxiety, OCD, depression, and general anxiety in high school. I don't know how all of that fits in here - whether they're all also true or some of them were misdiagnoses because I was a highly verbal teen girl.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My experience of AuDHD:

\- As a child I struggled hugely with emotional regulation, focus, organization, and follow-through. I was obsessed with fantasy worlds - with proving they were real. I read all the classic fantasy books obsessively. I worried massively about other people in the world hurting, esp my loved ones, and even inanimate objects like my stuffed animals, who I was very attached to. I talked A LOT and was advanced in terms of communication and intellectual skills, but notably behind socially. I tended to have one or two close friends to whom I was extremely attached, but generally felt better talking to adults. These are the things that led to my ADHD dx (ADD at the time), though I don't think in 1993 I ever would have been dx'ed as autistic.

\- As a teen, I had extremely close best friendships (I eventually came out as bi, which is another layer here), and eventually became the ""queen bee"" of my own little social circle of nerds. We had our own parties and adventures, and it was very important to me to be in control of all the dynamics. Otherwise, I felt overwhelmed and at risk of exclusion.

\- I was always too intense, too talkative, too loud, too-oversharing, too obsessed, too self-absorbed for everyone else. I always said and did the wrong thing or the awkward thing or the hurtful thing without meaning too. I became obsessed with analyzing social dynamics to figure out how to ""do them right.""

\- I used to sit on the floor in the hallway before school (I like cannot sit in a chair with my feet on the floor - it just feels wrong??) and sometimes kept toys on my desk. Even as an adult, I often worked while wrapped up in blankets. I've constantly been surprised to discover that these things are weird.

\- I also grew up in a white, Southern fairly affluent family where ""image"" and ""proper manners"" held a lot of weight. i can still hear my mother's voice assessing me in my head all the time.

\- I told my parents I didn't want to take ADHD meds anymore in 7th grade and they told me I didn't have to as long as I performed at the level they expected. So I did whatever I had to to achieve that.

\- I managed to be fairly successful both academically and career-wise largely by calculating exactly how much effort I had to expend in which ways in order to meet various standards. I impressed people with my writing and my ability to capture and express emotion creatively in said writing.

\- I went to seminary and became ordained, but found parish ministry challenging because there wasn't enough external structure and I found the social dynamics extremely overwhelming. I always thought I just wasn't trying hard enough.

\- I do not struggle as much with taking things too literally - I actually love metaphors. But I hate practical jokes or any situation where I'm supposed to just sus out the dynamics without knowing the explicit parameters and expectations.

\- I need schedules, agendas, attendees etc. I need details so I have something to hold onto.

\- I have always had some big sensory issues: the biggest one is fingers/fingernails on rough fabrics. Even just seeing or hearing someone else do it makes me scream involuntarily and curl up in the fetal position. I also really struggle with loud, sharp, or competing noises - I can't track a conversation or focus at all when these things are present. I can't deal with the feeling of cold air on my skin so I have to turn air vents away from me and I pretty much always wear long pants and keep a jacket with me. On the other hand, I LOVE heat and tend to keep my heated seats and fireplace on year round. These days, with 2 toddlers - i am literally constantly overstimulated and it feels like I may actually just stop being able to function.

\- I care very deeply for the people in my life but I'm not great at showing it or keeping up with them when they aren't present. And for some reason, even though I know my people love me, it's like I struggle to actually \*feel\* their love? It's frustrating and scary.

\- I'm actually very good at describing my emotions in very articulate detail, but I find it basically impossible to actually access difficult or intense emotions in front of other people. Like literally a main character died in my favorite show last week and I was watching with my spouse and I couldn't rewatch alone until today - so today I finally broke down and sobbed and before this I've been in a state of pseudo-emotional constipation and panic about it.

\- I get obsessed with certain things and it's all I can think about. I'll watch the same show dozens of times, learn everything there is to know about it, the writers, directors, all the actors. Read all the interviews, explore the fandoms. Write my own fanfic. It's not just that I'm into it - it's like it becomes a part of my identity. The Flash is like a key component of my love story with my husband - a big part of how we got together because when I was freaking out with anxiety and feeling tempted to run away when we first got together because I was overwhelmed, I would just watched The Flash over and over again to occupy my thoughts and keep me grounded. Eventually, i invited him to watch it with me - which was a BIG deal. I do also have shorter term hyper-fixations, but these deeper obsessions last for years and have a huge emotional component for me. Sometimes, i feel more connected to these imaginary things than the real world.

\- Sometimes i just can't stop thinking about or focusing on something I'm obsessed with to get other things done (see: writing this post while I'm on deadline for work). It's like I cannot get my brain to disengage.

\- Sometimes, I feel disconnected from my own life and the world? Like I'm watching it happen. It usually only happens for short stretches at a time, but it's really disconcerting.

\- I really struggle with body awareness. Like I can't really tell when I'm hungry or tired unless it's really bad. Or when a therapist asks me ""how does that feel in your body?"" like wtf does that even mean?? What am I supposed to be feeling??

\- I crave novelty, but I also find it really overwhelming. I try to know as much as I can about a new situation before hand (ie. I read the plots of shows and movies before I watch them, I memorize menus and even look at photos before I go to a new restaurant, etc)

\- I find social situations very overwhelming mostly because I feel like I have to be ""on"" the whole time. Constantly aware, analyzing, performing.

\- I thought I was good at reading people, but I'm starting to think maybe I just always assume people are upset with me...

\- I am mostly really disorganized and struggle to keep up with basic life stuff, but then I have these routines that keep me sane. I eat the same food every time I go to a restaurant, or at home I eat the same thing for lunch every day (and breakfast, and dinner). I have the routes I always drive to and from familiar places. And a pattern for how I make coffee.

\- I'm always noticing and identifying connections between things - noting patterns etc. The most obvious example of this I can think of is every time I see a numbers sequence, I immediately identify the relationships between them. Eg. my home phone number as a kid was all multiples of 3 etc.

\- Ever since I was a little kid, every couple of years I go through these ""episodes"" where for 2-3 weeks at time I get fixated on thoughts about death, eternity, infinity etc. The stuff our brains can't really understand. It causes panic-like sensations but I can't turn it off. It's like my brain keeps trying to understand what it can't and time collapses in on itself like it isn't real and nothing has meaning. During these episodes my only relief is sleep, but I can't really sleep or eat or function at all. it's gotten easier as I've gotten older, but as a kid they tortured me and I couldn't even tell anyone about them without triggering them again.

\- I really, really struggle with not knowing answers. I need certainty whenever there is certainty to be had. And I also really struggle with withholding information (about myself). It's like painful for me not to be radically transparent, which sometimes gets me in trouble, as you might imagine.

\- oh - I guess I didn't mention stimming. I think I thought i didn't stim because it's not the go-to ones I've always heard of. But I do constantly play with my fingers or tap my legs, and chew on pen caps, and apparently even just re-reading something you've written over and over (like this post lol) because the cadence is familiar and comforting is a form of stimming?? Who knew? So yeah, I guess I actually stim all the time...

\- I'm sure there are other things but this feels too long already. Thanks to anyone who managed to read this far.

I'm in burnout right now I think, and I just feel like an exposed nerve all the time. i'm taking naps twice a day despite not having time, everything takes so much energy, the brain fog is awful - i forget things like basic math and how to put a car in park, I am overloaded and struggling to figure out a way out - but I'm hopeful that identifying the autism element is a start.

\---

Does anyone relate to any of this? i guess I'm afraid all of these things could be true and not be autism. I don't know why that scares me except that it's like I finally have an answer that makes sense and I don't want to lose it.",2,1745370056.0,AutismTranslated,5,1.0,False

I started digging into it and learned that barometric pressure might mess with how we feel caffeine—especially if you’re prone to fatigue or headaches.

I’m not a scientist or anything, just someone who got curious and started tracking how I feel with the weather. It’s been oddly accurate.

Anyone else feel like their coffee buzz is better (or worse) depending on the weather or time of year? Wondering if this is just me or if other folks in Toronto have noticed it too.",6,1745370046.0,FoodToronto,2,0.75,False
